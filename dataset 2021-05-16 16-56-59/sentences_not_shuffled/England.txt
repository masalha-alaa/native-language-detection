There’s so many atrocities we’ve committed across the world but one that comes to mind rn is the concentration camps in South Africa which killed over 26 thousand women and children
I don’t know how unknown this is but Alan Turing who helped to break Nazis’ enigma code was arrested for being gay and was chemically castrated by the government he helped years ago
He was banned from GCHQ and the US which greatly effected his career
He killed himself in 1954
Same thing happened both naturally and unnaturally in the UK
We also tested nuclear weapons in the Australian outback in the 50s. We didn't make any real effort to warn the Aboriginal people and a lot of them died
We also tested the effects of nuclear weapons  on our own soldiers
We'll set up a camp and put our atrocities in it
Oh, wait
There isn't a corner of the earth where the population haven't been enslaved at some point
Yes they are the only ones
smh
Again, you clearly dont knowabout how many ķìù existed on this island
The UK
Brexit is embarrassing and Europe hates us, so it’s not like we’d be missed
Honestly I'm gonna have to sink myself, bye uk
Ireland
If the UK is gonna be the stupid racist evil country of this time period we may as well finish what we started
How do I get a flag
The Netherlands
The Dutch will just rebuild it anyway
Russia
It’s extremely big
Theses tsunamis should be fun
Now everyone who thinks Gibraltar is an island is actually right
Dutch hater
Pretty sure you mean East East Anglia
Thanks
Oh, I read European and Russia is partly in Europe, I’ll pick France then
But it’s way too small
Sorry gotta be france
Hands across the sea
Lucky bastard
Enjoy :D
So you are working to limit freedom of expression
Very progressive
As it should be
Wish we did that in the UK
We do that in the UK, up to 25 I think
And anyone in a vulnerable situation can collect them, like homeless and addicts and such
Why
Do people still say quid and pounds in Ireland
Whenever I go on holiday with my mrs no matter what re money is
It’s pounds in her mind
Same thing isn’t it
I obviously agree with you that it happened
And that’s my point
There is no law in the UK and no sane person is going round spouting that shite
I think it’s better to just debate and explain how retarded they are, Sunlight is the best bleach, instead of limiting free speech
From what I understand it was decriminalised because the Bolsheviks repealed the entire Tsarist criminal code, including the part about homosexuality
It wasn't specifically targeted
I agree
The UK definitely limits freedom of speech too
That doesn’t change what I said though
We don’t live in the Weimar Republic
It’s working pretty well everywhere else
You really think that if that law disappears then everyone will become a raging nazi
It doesn’t matter if one nazi doesn’t listen or debate, it matters that the public as a whole can see that the Nazi is wrong
Also you say it yourself if so one cantr accept the mountains of info we have about the holocaust then they are clearly idiots and insane and not worthy of being listened to
You aren’t genuinely comparing that to hitler r are you
I don’t think I can carry on a conversation with someone who thinks brexit voters are extremists
Well fuck
I think we're totally fucked
There were no good options, but Boris Johnson was the worst
Unsurprised despair
One of the things that I find most vile about this entire Brexit shitstorm is that the official name of the Conservative Party is actually the Conservative and Unionist Party, and it's [recently emerged] that most Tories would rather see Scotland and Northern Ireland leave than Brexit not happen
They're just awful
Awful
I can't see why so many pricks keep voting for them
I'm not even a big fan of Jeremy Corbyn but I'd much rather have him as prime minister than practically *any* Tory
I despair
I genuinely despair
I'm watching the disintegration of my country as I know it
The tiny lump of patriotism to which I'm still clinging is shrinking by the day
I wouldn't wish this on anyone
> "The essential English leadership secret does not depend on particular intelligence
Rather, it depends on a remarkably stupid thick-headedness
The English follow the principle that when one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it
They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous

Joseph Goebbels
You mean as an *independence supporting* Scot you're low-key happy
Not all Scots will be happy, especially those that want to remain
I myself am not happy because he's a twat and wants us to leave the EU without a deal
I want us to remain
Who want to storm parliament, they can‘t stop all of us
I don’t think it changes much
Johnson is incompetent and opportunistic but I think the comparisons to trump are unfair in that he doesn’t have the prickliness or tendency to do genuinely regressive things out of spite alone
He’ll probably embarrass himself (and by extension the country) a lot on the global stage but equally he has more charisma and more support among his party and voters than may, so I’ll be interested to see his strategy for Brexit
Ultimately though whether he or hunt won we’re still in the same position
The EU won’t budge on the terms of the deal, and there is no majority in parliament for anyway out of the current status quo (2nd ref/no Brexit, the current deal, or no deal) none of the options have enough support to pass and any attempt by the government to force them through was taken off the table by the vote to prevent pro-roguing or overriding parliament
So I would suspect that whatever boris tries to do either he or Parliament will be forced to avoid no-deal and seek another extension when the deadline comes up in October
I reckon it will be more interesting than habing Theresa May
Can I emigrate yet
FuckFuck Fuck  Fuck   Fuck    Fuck     Fuck      FUCK
Honestly Brexit is a mess and there’s not much anyone can do at this point BUT there is a small chance that by being loud SOMETHING will happen, whether it be a deal, no deal, or even no Brexit
I voted Labor
Boris Johnson will usher in a new golden age of prosperity, of peace, togetherness & understanding, of Britain rising to be even stronger etc
Boris Johnson will usher in, herald a golden age the likes of which has never been seen on this island before
He's just another limp-wristed David Cameron, who is a supporter of mass immigration and multiculturalism
I don’t care, but I’m sick of all the abuse by remainers
I just hope the UK leaves soon
I hope Boris can do it
I don’t believe the EU, I don’t think it’s a democratic institution, I don’t think it’s a bag of great things, I don’t think it’s gonna last and I believe change is healthier than stagnation
If it backfires, at least we can say we tried
If it doesn’t, it will be good
Anyway, instability is inevitable, and insulting people and acting as if we were drowning immigrants in the Thames won’t make life easier or solve anything
So let’s get out and see what happens
Boris will be criticised whether he does a good job or not
If he leaves, another will take his place and half the country will be unhappy
Doesn’t make any difference, so let’s be done with this
We don't deserve anyone's sympathy
We did this to ourselves
Hunt is worse
Most Tory members, not voters - important distinction though
We didn't actually vote for Boris Johnson
Only Conservative Party members got to vote
Um I'd say both
I do dislike Hunt and he's certainly not ideal but I think he would make a much more reasonable, competent and capable Prime Minister
I'd much prefer him over Boris Johnson (but then again that's not a very high bar)
Nope, it'll be "we could have had our unicorns if it weren't for the evil EuSSR punishing us for leaving, god bless good old Boris, man of the people".
I mean I’m deffo part of that group
Marched against this bullshit
Twice
Yep
That's just how it is
I'm not complaining though, just pointing out that the public didn't vote for Boris Johnson
We did vote for Brexit yeah, but I think it's unfair to say that the people voted for Johnson (+ likely incoming no-deal Brexit) simply because a chain of events led to this
And besides, there's still the half of the population that *didn't* vote for Brexit and have to live with the outcome too
Theresa "I'm willing to get rid of human rights to catch terrorists" May
As much as I hate her though, I *still* pity her a bit: she was put in an unworkable situation, with no "correct" solution
We don't have bruh moments here, we just blame it on the french
The last four years
Actually the Charge of the Light Brigade was a success, because we won the Battle of Balaclava, but it was just with higher losses than would have otherwise been the case

You need to click the country you're from and then "apply"
I cant imagine being so fluent in another language That this would ever become a problem
I'm English and have lived in mainland Europe for 5 years, I speak basic English so much with non-native English speakers that I've definitely got worse at speaking it at a decent level
As a native English speaker the numbers used to throw me off when learning German
I mean, I do
I’m from Nottingham in the East Midlands of English
To me, it’s a very recognisable accent especially since I live in London with my brother and another East Midlander; our flat is a little oasis of East Midlands English
And yet, it is an accent that basically no one has heard of, even amongst English people, and is barely ever represented in TV and certainly not in films
My boyfriend is Northern Irish and I love his accent
He doesn’t really care about what I sound like and actually dislikes when I really lean into it
So yeah
it’s an accent I really like to hear despite being so unknown, and frankly ignored
I have been called ‘Southern’ by Northerners and l’m _constantly_ being called ‘Northern’ by Southerners
It’s infuriating
I’m from the fucking Midlands
Sometimes when I'm watching YouTube and the guy/girl whose channel it is if they're a non-native English speaker(usually it's either Norwegians/Swedes/Danes/Dutch) yet their respective accents are so neautral/English/American sounding, their English is so good and natural that they sound near enough 100% like a born native speaker, like it's to the point that if you didn't know they were non-native you'd never of known they were
I think they can easily fool a native English speaker
It's quite the surprise finding out they're actually not English, sometimes it's given away by how they pronounce the odd word, but it's literally like a single word
Their mastery of English is something else
But regarding my accent, I've a very mild West Country/Bristolian accent, think Samwise Hanger but much milder, think the Witcher 3's area of Velen with all the peasants and their West Country/Bristolian accents, mines very similar to that
but again much, much milder more of a very slight twang instead of a accent, nothing to full on or thick
Personally I don't mind thick accents
I feel like they tell a story of a person's origin and or where they've been
A life story of sorts
I certainly don't make fun of anybody's accent
I mean that's very rude and counterproductive when it comes to trying to understand somebody
It's not my jam
My accent varies
Born and raised in Nottingham but people mistake me that i'm southern (particularly from Surrey) because I don't speak like everyone else around here
Not sure why
It comes out when I'm arguing or drunk though
I think it's a decent accent
I like the Polish accent, I think certain Poles have a nice cadence, and the accent has a nice flow, infact here's my favourite Polish accent
It's nothing to be ashamed about imo
My favourite Italian accent, it has great sing songy flow imo, really adds to the subject matter in the videos too, not off-putting at all
Foreign accents sound better than some of our native ones
Don't be ashamed guys, its amazing you even know a second language
I've seen this from many Germans who are like ashamed of their accent or that they dont know an unusual word or perhaps they pronounce something slightly wrong and then act like they've embarrassed their entire family and are a sham of a person
Guys, its cool
As much as we will take the piss out of you barking orders at us when saying hello we actually quite like your accents and your English is often better than ours as we reduce our language down to colloquialism
Love the German accent idk why
Mate, I’m English
The English language originates from my country and Hollywood _still_ likes to makes English people out to be baddies and villains
As the risk of sounding like a snobby European, the way our accents are portrayed in big films and TV says less about us and more about Americans
My favourite Greek accent(  ), he has a nice cadence to his voice
I think most English people like french accents or are neutral about them
We don't really care about accents because, since English is kind of an international language, we're very used to hearing non-native speakers
And even within our own country we have a huge variety of accents so we're used to other accents in general
That’s funny
unless it’s a truly ridiculous comedy accent, the French accent is often thought of as being quite sexy and sophisticated in a lot of English speaking countries
My favourite Italian accent
That's what Kimi Raikonen sounds like
In comparison though Valtteri Bottas hardly has a Finnish accent at all
Like it's so neautral and not far off native sounding(like it's not identical but it's really not hugely far away) that you wouldn't know Valtteri was Finnish, European yes but not Finnish) you wouldn't think Raikonen and Bottas are from the same country going by how they speak, but they are
I'm guessing it's a generational thing
Older Fins having the thicker more pronounced accent compared to younger Fins who are more accustomed to speaking English
Sorry but Dutch English speakers very very very very very very much have a distinctive accent to us
I find it very hard to believe that your accent is totally neutral
Please dont take this as an insult - The dutch English accent is super endearing
TBF depending on the accent would've and 'Would of' do sound pretty much the same
Are you aware of any accents that we don't make fun of
Ah, Der Kommissar Oettinger
I think of the Puss In Boots(from the Shrek series) when i think of the classic Spanish accent
Its such a sexy, epic accent
It has such a nice flow, candence and sound to it
Just so yummy
My point is that we make fun of all accents
I did not know that, thanks for the info
I'll say it's a shame they couldn't of gone with Antonio's true accent then, gone with a more natural, less forced and less thick stereotypical Andalusian Spanish accent
That'd of been nice to hear
But I guess in a fantasy animation everything has to be turned up to 11
It's like Japanese anime, nobody actually talks like that irl but it's all for dramatic effect, it has to captivate people and be larger than life
And in that aspect Antonio Banderas nailed it
I lived in Portugal for a couple years, and honestly I wouldn't have dreamed of judging anyone that could speak two languages where I could only speak one (Even after trying my best to pick up Portuguese (It's such a difficult language
Frankly, I was just grateful that they chose to speak to me in my language at all
Besides, if anything, I always thought the Portuguese -> English accent was always rather pleasant
Fair enough
I still hold that I feel grateful that it's my language people are willing to speak, and those that have managed fluency in two or more are amazing to me
Most teenagers in the UK have Iphones
I’d say about 80% have iphones and the rest of people have androids and google pixels
I think with adults, the ratio is around 60/40 with most having iphones
I switched from Iphone to Google Pixel because Iphones are hugely overpriced
I think the new SE might be a decent option though
I pay something like £25 a month which included a free chrombook, Pixel3A and like 12gb of data, unlimited calls/text etc etc
If I didnt get the phone included it would be like £10 a month
Also the Iphone makes you look pretty basic TBH
Like i'd expect a 17 year old girl to have an Iphone because some singer they idolise also has one
It's 52% iPhone and 48% Android in the UK, according to the site OP posted
Right on the age group thing though imo, in the US, Android's are seen as cheap phones for kids etc and Apple are used for work, not the case in the UK at all
Not really true
The entire UK civil service issues iPhones for work use
That just isn't true, I used to work for the MoD in the civil service and they issued Android phones
They issued iPhones in the Home Office in 2018
I may have been slightly off to assume it applied to,all
Slough, gravesend, Oldham, Scunthorpe, Grimsby, skengness maybe, brum, Blackpool, Luton, a lot of Lincolnshire and around there tbf
just read the names of the first few and that will give an idea of how it is there
Milton Keynes
Theres no highstreet or cosy centre
The layout and housing designs tend mostly to be ugly and very 60/70s style of houses
not seeing enough shame for Swindon here
a dreary place that is a volatile mix of heavy South Asian immigration and some seriously, seriously racist people
lot's of violence, poverty and crime
not a pleasant place at all
Ooooh slough
My kinda town,
I don’t know how
Anyone could put you down
-David Brent
Same with London tbf
If they’re think that’s ugly they should see shitty London
When I first heard about somewhere called "Wolfsburg" I imagined some medieval city on top of a hill surrounded by leagues of dark forest
Guessing it's not that
Where does Volendam rank on the incest scale
Honestly, Birmingham is getting better
The city centre is almost nice now, with the library, the Bullring, and the pedestrianised area in the centre
There are even trams now
The suburbs are still often rather bleak, but parts of the city are alright
I went to Malmö on holiday once and found it to be a very quiet, sleepy town
Was only there for a few days but that was my impression
Yet I constantly hear Swedes talk about it like it’s New York in the 80s without all the good shit
Also home to many of the UKs biggest recent Islamic terrorists
Hard to be ashamed of Coventry, it's more depressing because it was once one of our finest preserved medieval cities before it was bombed by the Nazis
I think I've read claims that it was the most preserved city in all of Europe
If you’re getting a train to Windsor, you’d have to change at Slough (the branch line to Windsor diverges there)
It’s further out then Heathrow though, you wouldn’t pass it on the way there
I wouldn't say it's like the North
Its a distinctly southern type of grimness
A middle of the road London commuter Town, with no distinguishing features
Its not grim, or run down or does it display any of the post industrial grimness associated with the worst parts of the North
Its just a place that dreams go to die
Leeds isn't terrible, it's at least got a much better economy, more vibrant suburbs and a stronger sense of community than the surrounding towns and cities
Of all the major places in urban Yorkshire it's far from the worst
Bradford, Keighley, Dewsbury, Huddersfield, Rotherham are all far worse
Source: Live in Keighley, have been through surrounding area, Leeds is far better than the rest
Wow, that’s more than three times as many as London’s 2019 murder rate of 1
5 per 100,000 people
Because we went to Copenhagan and thought we’d just cross the bridge to Sweden
Home to most of the UKs terrorists
My vote would go to Birmingham
It was once one of our most economically and scientifically active cities but would turn into the grey and brutalist city that it's stereotyped as during the post-war period and government deliberately sought to reduce its population
Though it's looking up right now, it's still quite behind its natural place in the country
It’s all about personal preference really
The line from Slough is pretty cool though, because there’s a great view of the castle if you go that way
Wigan has soul
The UK’s was 1
2 in 2017
Just slightly less murder-y than us
Slough station is literally the best thing about Slough though
nice buildings, and you get to watch the trains whooshing past (which can be rather fun)
I love living in London and knowing I can always fall back on “Sorry I was underground”
Not really the topic, but I was late to a lecture once because the train stopped due to ‘excessive snow fall’ that clogged the air horn
Sounds fake, but it actually happened
I really needed to tell that story, so thanks for reading this
only really works in the countryside, but "sheep in the road" usually works

But he has made up his mind, and since he knows that if he turns back on this decision he will never be able to make any important decision again
I'm english and literally just learnt from another comment in this thread that were meant to use flat, not apartment, so yes
What about American words (you know, the stereotypical ones like couch, sidewalk, pants (for trousers), gas (for petrol), vacation, candy, etc
etc
And what about accent
For example how do you pronounce the short O sound like in [not] Or do you pronounce your word-final Rs
Is it all British
Or is there some American in there
Also by the way, -ize spellings are considered acceptable in British English too
-ise is more common but both are used, whereas in America only -ize is used
Thanks for responding
So I suppose it is a little bit of a mix
> The American sounds entirely too much like an A to me
Ditto haha
That's exactly how it comes across to me 'naaat'.
> "We arr going to speak to the professorr"
Haha, writing it out like that looks like a West Country accent to me, who are also known for their Rs
> For instance, I say "sofa" and "coriander" instead of "couch" and "cilantro",
Cilantro
That's a new one
I never knew Americans didn't say coriander before
But yeah that is an odd case
You've got it backwards to most people I've encountered who (at least try to) use British spelling and terminology, but have a distinctly American influenced accent
That makes sense really, and I can't say I'm surprised with the accent; that seems to very often be the case
I just wondered because I often see people say on r/AskEurope that they use British English and then go on to just talk about British spelling, and I was curious whether they use British terms and pronunciation too
I think I get what you mean
My French is pretty shit but I sometimes try to do something like that, for example I try to force myself to say *semblable* rather than *similaire* more often simply because otherwise I feel like I am simply Frenchifying English words rather actually knowing the French word
>> sidewalk
> what even is the british version of that
Pavement (although personally I would tend to just say path)
Sidewalk sounds *really* weird and literal to our ears
>> candy
> not using sweets
Any reason why
Gasp
We have a convert
You, my good sir, have brought a tear to my eye
I shall brew some tea in your honour
Eh the differences are pretty minimal and English spelling as a whole is pretty complicated
I don't think it's enough to make any real difference to how simple spelling is
Yeah, it's definitely not as clear cut as American = rhotic, British = non-rhotic
There are traditionally non-rhotic American accents (that you mention), and traditionally rhotic British accents (mostly Scotland and the West Country I think)
But I think it's still a pretty good distinction here as most English language learners are taught either something close to General American (which *is* rhotic) or something close to Recieved Pronunciation (which *isn't*)
> For example, the culture of the rural deep south is rooted in the border wars between England and Scotland
Interesting
That's something I've never heard about before
I might have to take a look at that book
Fair
I just wondered if there was some reason you disliked the word or something, since for the others you just said what you do use but for candy/sweets you said that you won't use sweets
I was reading into it too much
Don't worry
Very well put
Think I've got some in the cupboard
Have you ever tried Lady Grey
Took a sec, I had stuff to do, but cheers for being on the right side of the English language
Taduck
Not weaker but more of an orange bergamot flavour
Worth a try
Said it before, and I’ll say it again
The gaps in toilet stalls
I’d heard of them before I visited but they still shocked me
Literally like 2cm of space between the partitions, for literally zero reason at all
People can look right into the stall
Goodbye privacy
Why
Whyyyyyy
Baffling
My aunt and uncle live in the States and we would often meet their friends
One of them had a daughter my age (I was 9 at the time) and she ended up taking me to her softball practice (looking back I’ve no clue why)
The girls on her team looked at me like I was a bloody neon unicorn and when I tried to politely ask one of them for a piece of gum (she had a massive bucket and was sharing them) she barked “WHAT
” at me
That was the moment I realised that being at least somewhat polite to strangers even if their presence confuses you is not a universal thing
I wasn’t upset just a bit shocked and intrigued
Almost everyone drives a massive SUV
It was almost obscene
Also, flags
Flags everywhere
Really
Never knew that
That is quite interesting
The norwegian culture is very opposite and it must be a weird experience
My comment was about the toilet gaps
Insane
> I witnessed a mother opening several packs of sugar and sprinkle it in their kids Coca Cola
I’m still speechless
Honestly, this sound crazy but I actually find that more gross than 99% of the stuff you see in the weird sureddits
I think because I can jut imagine them doing that all the time like it was normal and its so upsetting
If anyone said something like that about my dick I’d zip right back up and bounce
Their loss
I remember counting exact change and then the guy on the till after having given my order, saying it costed more
I was very confused and wasn’t even sure I had enough money, so now a social nightmare of a situation commenced
Can I cancel my order, what do I do
I look through my change to see, the guy starring at me
I start to panic, I try to find more money
Its not there
He then spots this weird looking coin, which I had thought were worth 5 cent or something
But no, this coin had the apparent value of like 25 cent
Why isn’t the currency labelled with the number on
Its all resolved, but leaving it brought the question, how the hell are you meant to get exact without using calculators
Lol
Just to highlight how different it is; I've been made uncomfortable by the friendliness in NYC
Then
change them
You have the power
You sweetheart
Thanks for your kindness
I’m a woman and this happened more than a decade ago, I’ve gone back to the States many times since then and met some of the friendliest people ever
Especially in NYC, I don’t know where the stereotype that New Yorkers are unfriendly comes from
It obviously *isnt* rude as its their country and their culture
But one cant help but feel weird if you're not at all used to it
Yeah but are we talking about all adults or just teachers here
I visited NY a year or so ago and was amazed how friendly everyone was
I’d heard of the New York thing but was pleasantly surprised, much friendlier than London and certainly friendlier than Paris (God, never again)
I can't believe any human could actually fit that thing in their stomach
A loaf of bread over there won’t go bad after a month
There’s so many preservatives in it
See I live in London so thats normal for me an I have zero problems in Paris

The reason the EU gives the US Visa free access is because it's beneficial to the EU
I'm not sure what planet some of you are living on where you think this is some great act of philanthropy from the EU
They aren't doing them a favour
Many countries do not have reciprocal visa arrangements
I think the EU should disband
>I think it’s more complicated then it seems at first
"No
I want to jingoistically criticise the US and talk up sanctions and actions to make Europa feel strong
How Europhiles can't see this dangerous creep of Nationalism coming from their own mouths is quite frightening
Because we are detached from the Pan European Nationalism acceleration we've seen in Europe in the past 5 years and are able to see the wood from the trees
Trump is a buffoon, and will be gone next year
Brexit is the UK leaving a union its public was never really invested in further than economics
The UK and The US are not your enemy
It's not national socialism, you're arguing a straw man there
It's nationalism in the traditional sense, painting an enemy in order to create national (or in this case pan national) cohesion in order justify further integration
Vilifying anyone who wishes to leave
Europe should know this is a dangerous path
I wasn't saying thats what you were saying
I was saying people don't want to hear the logical reason why the EU offer what they offer and vice versa, they want a reason to rally against the US
Pan European Nationalism has now shifted it's reliance on an enemy (as all nationalism requires) from Russia to the Anglosphere
Brexit and Trump gave them the perfect ammunition to affirm and act on their underlying biases that have existed since the early 20th century
The economic benefits were not worth the political cost to many
It seems money is everything for some but not for all
The British public has never really felt part of "the family" in my opinion, rightly or wrongly
If not for the economic benefits of the Single Market (or the economic threat of leaving it), I feel the leave vote would have been comfortably over 60%.
There are very very few pro EU integration British in my experience
Most remainers only support remain because they think leaving is economic suicide
I feel as though some form of brexit was inevitable although I felt soft brexit was always more likely, but people pushing to cancel brexit polarised the debate (IMHO)
I would expect the brains of European's to not be entirely 1984d and remember further back than the last 5 years and look further ahead than 5 years
If you think the US and The UK are your enemy you are a victim of propaganda, the same way as if a British leave voter thinks Europe is their enemy
>Well that’s fine then - but why is it a problem then for you that the EU will now give those benefits only to member states and exclude the UK from them ?
>Cause I guess that’s what you mean with the claim That the EU is behaving nationalistic
Not what I meant at all
More the rhetoric seen from European politicians, public and media
Very hostile language and in some cases such as labelling Gibraltar a colony, actions
Considering you are a European who interacts with London based metropolitan youngsters, I'm not surprised you've never met a brexit voter
If you had they would likely be firmly in the closet about it
90% of our country does not reside in London remember
I'd also like to note that this passion for the EU is a recent invention spawning directly from the referendum result
This whole wrapping yourself in the yellow and blue flag shit didn't really exist here before the vote
It's developed as a kind of a weird pro status quo counterculture
>Do you fear European retribution for Brexit
I feel as though Europe is going to repeat the same mistakes of old
I don't trust the people who constantly end up in positions of power in the EU (La Garde, der Leyen, Juncker, Vehofsdadt) tot take it to a position which represents the demos of Europe
>Telling you that you won’t get preferential treatment ?
>Telling you that imports / exports will be scrutinized ?
>Telling you that the well being of British citizens is an afterthought over the well-being of EU citizens ?
No, no, no
>And as for Gibraltar - expect the EU from now on to be on the Spanish side of things - since you guys are not part of the club anymore
My exact point was that the UK is being framed as an enemy by the EU, and then you say "if you're not in our club we will support our members illegal claims on your land".
How the fuck is that not hostile
>That’s not hostility
That’s just politics
Sure, and if the UK decided to vocally support and fund Catalonian independence movements, that would just be politics
No hostility
Just politics
And the UK's response will also be between the UK and Spain of course
>No that would be hostility - as the UK would interfere in the internal politics of another country - the same as if Spain would help Scotland to gain independence for example (which it doesn’t do)
So is Macron saying "Irish unification would solve the brexit issue" not interfering in the internal politics of another country
You seem to be struggling to apply any consistent scrutiny to the EU that you're applying to the UK
Let's see if you're capable
Interesting
So Macron can call for Irish unification and that is fine
Not a hostile act
Totally diplomatically reasonable
This jingoism will come back to bite Europe
It may take a long time, but it will
>If you call someone saying “hey there is a problem here that can be solved like this, but in the end it’s up to you” jingoism well - then everything is jingoism as soon as someone dares to say anything that doesn’t fall in line with UK wishes
So if Boris Johnson stated publicly "Catalonian independence would solve the problems there at the moment" this would be acceptable in your opinion
The weakening of Spain and the distraction of Spain from Gibraltar via the Catalonian question would absolutely be of British interest in regard to Gibraltar
Of course
The same way Macron is supporting the break up of the United Kingdom we should advocate the break up of Spain as a means to an end regarding Gibraltar
Perhaps a support of Catalonia in exchange for their support against Spanish Francoists on Gibraltar
Sounds like an excellent idea
All diplomatically acceptable according to you of course
>And in fact Johnson had an opinion about the referendum it was (and I quote) : “The Catalonian referendum is a matter for the Spanish govt & people
Imp that Spanish constitution respected & the rule of law upheld
“ so he basically said what I said -> it’s an internal Spanish matter which does not affect anyone else and had to be solved there
So Johnson did the exact opposite of what Macron did
How is this contributing to your point
> Again - Irland is Part of the EU, France is Part of the EU, as such France is interested in a positive outcome of Brexit for Ireland
Which includes no violence in NI due to the possibility of a hard border between NI and the Republic
But Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, is leaving, in the same sense you wouldn't expect Macron to support the UK as it is leaving
>Plus support for Catalonian independence would probably give Scottish independence also rise - and I guess you don’t want that
If the Scots want to be independent good for them
> And are you finally able or willing to Answer my questions ?
Sure
Your argument seems to be that because the UK is leaving the EU, the EU should happily support any jingoistic action against the UK, whether it be blockading Gibraltar or lobbying for the break up of the UK
To which you ask "what do you expect"?
I would expect such actions from Russia or China, not from the EU
Perhaps my expectations are too high
David Cameron coined the idea of Brexit and then campaigned against it, thus meaning he had to resign
Boris Johnson rugby tackled a 7 year old asian child
There were euro sceptics about for a long time before Cameron
But yeah he really fucked It with the promise of the referendum lol
Did he also birth Nigel Farage on that fateful day of “coining brexit
He gave us the vote to get into power
I love how we’ve culminated together on one comment
All the chippys close

That's awesome
Are Irish pubs actually closed or only 'officially closed'?
Spoken to a pub landlord in England who was talking about trying to do lock-ins if the government closes the pubs
So even if they put a ban on protesting you’ll go out on protest against medical advice
Don’t encourage them to claim even more European ‘heritage’
Answer the question
I genuinely have no idea what you mean by that movie point
So you half answered it there
Now answer this question; if the government bans large gatherings and protesting during this pandemic, will you ignore it
So why do they always say their 2/73 Dutch with a sprinkle of Italian
They’re proper weird with that shit
So what I’ve learnt today is that you can’t do hypotheticals
Ducking hell, either I’ve worded this shit wrong or you’re an actual walking stereotype
That’s not a complement
Good for you mate
We need more of that in England
I’ll Definitely be doing that
since 2016, no
A certain ball kicking event has been implanted in our brains since
You mean Luxembourg
Not Liechtenstein
I would support it but would it be sustainable
Would enough people use the line for it to be worth it
First skip then general read
The good thing about this sub is seeing what people have in common and fascinating differences that are incomprehensible
couldn't do that without reading other nations
I would do the same for the Brit ones but there are so many, it's like a plague you can't control
Yes, a lot, and I still don't know how to feel about them
Yeah quite a lot
It normally shows a depressed looking african child with some sad music in the background then asks you to donate to build schools and to get clean water to their towns
I feel like a lot of the Starving African Children images go back to the Ethiopian famine of 1984 to which Band/Live Aid was a response
The [famous report by Michael Buerk] on British TV, in a period when you just didn't see images like that, is certainly seared into my memory - I'd have been 6 when it first aired - and prompted a massive response from the public
*Do They Know It's Christmas* gets a lot of (justified) stick for it's lyrics but it's easy to forget the images that were in people's heads when writing, recording and buying it - nobody was thinking thst there were starviing kids in Morocco or South Africa or Ghana - it was specifically about Ethiopia in 1984
If "Ethiopia" had three syllables the song wouldn't get nearly as much criticism
Likewise, Ethiopia is majority Christian but the song doesn't think they don't know it's Christmas because they're Muslim, but because they're *busy with an apocalyptic famine*.
English person here
I didn’t know this but found it really funny when I found out
We have a word for “public homosexual intercourse” and the word for that is cottaging
I don’t know how that word came around but it’s just funny how that somehow became a problem for us so we had to make a word for it
English person here
I didn’t know this but found it really funny when I found out
We have a word for “public homosexual intercourse” and the word for that is cottaging
I don’t know how that word came around but it’s just funny how that somehow became a problem for us so we had to make a word for it
Not a word really used outside of someone deliberately using it to sound ridiculous
They only say kindergarten in the USA
We just say Nursery or playgroup in the UK
Only in the US
In the UK it’s ‘nursery’.
I mean in England we just use nursery but yeah
I'm sure you'll find there's plenty of words in your own language taken from English
It’s crazy that so many people are commenting about ‘stolen’ words
One of English’s defining features is how mixed it is and how many loanwords we have
Most of the vocabulary in English is derived from French
It’s usually translated by English speakers as ‘separateness’.
The O is silent, if that helps
It's not a bad word
It's used on the news, during sports etc
It's mainstream
I imagine pussywhipped is probably a closer comparison to Mounódoulos
> synecdoche
I've never heard or read that word anywhere ever
Probably the same way cottaging came around
It became a problem in the country then they had to write a law on it
Ah, that's the proper word
I learned a pidgin version as "lunterfutting" years ago, but I'm pleased to know the real one
I know I know
just pointing out that people seem surprised that words aren’t changed or anglicised
Just taken and used as is hahaha
And
I have no idea what woman you’re about
link
dogging is where you watch someone have intercourse in public and cottaging is where you engage in homosexual intercourse in public
Usually no one is watching when cottaging is happening
They’re tremendous
Wait seriously
I can't remember the last time snow fell on my birthday (25th December)
(England) Whenever England play Germany, youll hear "2 World wars and 1 world cup" chants
And there might be the odd war joke, nothing serious
I've never actually heard any serious xenophobia towards Germany
I don’t think so, it’s a hard one with the UK
I think because we were never occupied there is not really any hatred nowadays to them or anything, but obviously a lot of former ww2 fighters and euro skeptics will not like them
There is some in the UK, mostly amongst chavs (British version of rednecks) who spend their time getting drunk and being racist in pubs
Because we’re taking the piss
It’s being comedically arrogant _and_ self-deprecating
We know the stats
Frankly the only reason why people are so against Germany regarding football is because you’re so fucking good at it (most of the time)
Theyre not very smart
Wack a bit of drum and bass behind it and its a bop, Lizzies bopaholic tunes
Quality episode
Wasn't aware of it, im 18 and I'm Welsh
As far as I'm aware, foktball hooliganism isn't something that reflect the gernal attitude of the country
>Morris dancing
Should be a capital offense in my opinion
To be honest, any European company that seemed vaguely foreign as a kid all came from an imaginary country that was a mixture of every European country west of Poland where people's lips never synched up to what they were saying
>Häagen-Dazs
For anyone who doesn't know, they chose that brand name so it would sound Danish and therefore cool
The irony of course is that it doesn't look even remotely Danish, but of course it does succeed in sounding sort of exotic
You barely get baked beans in the US
That's rather sad
They don't *only* go with fry ups
> how is sounding Danish a business strategy
I think Scandinavian stuff was in fashion
But remember this was from someone who clearly had no idea about Danish (and aimed at people who had no more idea) so I suppose it's not surprising they made an error
They chose that name about 20 years before the internet was invented XD
What can I say -- they're good
*Universal* Healthcare is a must but it doesn't have to look like, for example, the NHS, where the entire system is funded from taxes because otherwise ThEyRe PrIvAtIiSiNg tHe NhS

It's crazy how much it changes within a few miles
I live about 15 miles outside manchester and our tap water is class
As soon as I moved to central manc it was much worse
It's weird because the reservoir I can see from my window sends water to Liverpool/Wigan and we get lake district water
I guess that second part explains why ours is good though
Basic social interaction with strangers in public seems to be a big no no in england, hehe
Went to a Auschwitz
The amount of twats taking selfies pissed me off
Is respecting the dead that difficult
I've noticed it's often misspelt as Whales
Maybe they think The Prince of Whales is just some bizarre British tradition where he is actually claiming to be the king of the whales
70% of British people will believe a statistic if you put a percentage in front of it
Lots of Turks smuggle German cigarettes to the English black market
Why have you bot taxed the fuck out of it like everyone else
Flula Borg makes up for it
A big problem in my opinion is the lack of emphasis of learning from a young age
Of course, the fact that a GCSE in a language is no longer mandatory sucks, but honestly the standard of GCSE French (from my experience of being a 16 year old who would have been sitting the exams this year) is tripe, and it is, of course, much harder to learn them as you get older
Stands up
Half my championship team is Austrian, even the manager
It appears 85% of french people do too
It’s infuriating
We’re constantly entering the most boring, generic dross and wonder why we always do shit

Sounds like england could join too
Interesting I would have expected the UK to be more mid table too
Yeah I've had a few situations with Irish people (I find Irish people on reddit will swear blind that these situations never happen or I must have been super unlucky but its something thats happened with almost every Irish person i've met) where after a few drinks they will start talking about all the bad things 'the English' have done and how 'the English' are naturally bad people
I'll usually give a sarcastic 'yeah thanks lads, sound of you' and get a 'oh but I dont mean you, I mean 'the English' in response
I’m English and my boyfriend is Irish, more specifically Northern Irish
Whenever we talk about the shit that the UK has inflicted upon Ireland over the centuries, it’s always with the obvious understanding that 99% of modern British people had absolutely nothing to do with any of it
I think what Irish people really want is just for British people to be more aware of our shared history
That’s all
That being said
very, very occasionally, you do get the impression that some people want the British to feel guilty for crimes past
The phrase “don’t hold your breath” comes to mind
TBF all the jokes aside I dont think the numerous wars between our countries could ever be awkward, its just like a non thing
Yeah 100% same with my experiences, I always stand by my view that in my travels the Irish i meet are always the ones we have the most fun with, with how similar we are it's baffling the history is so messy and tragically brutal
That's not the sort of thing anyone world banter about though
I doubt the UK is wealthier than Spain or Italy
The UK has a lot of poverty
As others have said, diet and climate is a big factor
But, in my opinion, it's lazy bastards
Here in the UK, we have a very lenient benefits system which is abused
People use it as an excuse not to work, becoming 'couch potatoes' and therefore not exercising their bodies
I'm not saying all of those who are on benefits are the same, a lot are genuine, but it is taken advantage of
As a motorcycle rider I do fit the stereotype and I pretty much speed everywhere apart from residential area's. Trouble is on my 650km weekly commute I doubt I see a police office once a week, so basically we don't have anyone to enforce anything, part of the reason driving standards are getting worse year on year
In fairness I think people would behave very differently to seeing two women holding hands and two men holding hands
Ahh well that’s alright then
Nothing to worry about
Nothing at all
My school was infamous for their pranks after exams a few notable mentions are filling the geography classroom with crickets and locusts; sewing a fish into the curtains so over summer it rotted and the class had to be shut; releasing 3 chickens with 1,2 and 4 tied round their neck so the teachers spent 2 weeks looking for number 3 and using weed killer to draw a penis on the front field the week the google street view car was due
Nerf gun school shooting
We have muck up day, on the year 13s last day at school, where they can do anything they want, blue up paint bombs, interrupt classes, trap cows on the roof, put constipation meds in ice cream and give it to the students
There's something called muck-up day which is quite common (i think)
It's for leavers, and on the last day of the school year, before study leave and GCSE/A level exams are taken, when everyone else is still in school for the next few months, year 11/13 supposedly get to do whatever they want
My first year at secondary school was wild (well, compared to recent years), since they had waterguns, silly strings, moved everything around in the school (aka lockers were all over the place, so where desks/chairs etc), they also did flour bombs and put pads on the door handles and a ton of other stuff that I can't particularly remember
The annoying thing is that stuff happened the next year, which is why the school has been cracking down on it really hard, and it's now become quite strict and limited to (i think) before/after school
one of the most scottish things i've ever read
U dont gave muck up day
We had end of year 11 pranks at my school - South West
The only one i remember is that our physics teacher was always starring at his clock (understandably
) so some kids stole his clock
Pretty tame - i like your bin one more
They can't even manage a different accent half the time so another language is definitely a big ask
Howling with laughter at Upham in *Saving Private Ryan* describing his German accent as "clean, with a touch of Bavarian".
His English sounds ridiculous as well, but that might be the cocainum
In the north of uk where I am it’s very common if you’re in a rural area to say hi to people or wish them a good morning/afternoon/evening although I’ve found younger people are more and more inclined not to do this so it’s become more of an older or polite thing to do but very few would consider it outright rude not to make eye contact or say hello, unless they say hello and you don’t reply haha
I found it was nice when walking my dog to say hi and be nice to randoms it just seemed to set my day up in a nice way :)
Only really (from my experience) if the path isn’t very busy
I've been told it's because it's cheaper than having a bouncer in there to make sure drunk dickheads aren't trashing the place
Not common but you'll likely see a few people doing this in the UK
I live in Toronto now and most women would call me sexist if I addressed them with any of those terms
They're brothers, the Healy-Raes
They represent a very rural area where there's no late public transport and few (if any) taxis so this attitude goes down well with the locals
Rest of the country (as far as I can tell) think they're a pair of lunatics
Just feel like its worth adding; To go dutch is a phrase that is very rarely said here
We say 'split the bill'.
Nice ones for us, savage ones for the French
Ah, the old alliance
Its a very old expression and rarely used
I think the Americans might still use it
So many of us are accepting draconian policies under the premise of the emergency that we can't be that punitive until it's over
Orbán will always have the argument it's justified to save lives, he's not extreme; it's us that aren't doing enough
Once the pandemic is over is when the EU or whoever needs to come down on any government that won't relinquish their emergency powers
In practice I'm not sure what the EU of other national governments cant really do
Sanctions perhaps
The problem with Hungary is that nobody seriously wants to put the main opposition in power
Jobbik are not better than Orban
I'd rather have a dictator than a nazi personally
The EU - the institution - will survive even if their "European dream" never realises
They still have a few countries that might join, mainly in the Balkans, like Albania and Montenegro
Furthermore the far-right populist movement is waning in most countries and also have differing views on the EU, even the LN-M5S coalition never tried to Itexit, and the far-left populist movement isn't a big threat
I'm sure the great day when Turkey and Russia and Belarus and Azerbaijan and a reunified Moldova and Armenia which all have 100/100 Freedom House Scores are part of a United Europe won't come any time soon but the EU isn't going anywhere
the biggest nightmare is if the EU gets taken over by people like that, I'd rather it just died than that happened
Still, there's too many countries that vote overwhelmingly for pro-EU parties
Even in Germany, AfD and all, the Union/SPD/Greens would still get a majority (without even factoring in the FDP and other parties)
I was in Romania and Moldova recently, and a lot of the Romanians say the Roma are thieves etc, because they are
Whether that's because of years of discrimination and not being able to get regular work isn't really our problem, but I don't want  any people without a basic education coming in to the UK
I was once on the phone to a Glaswegian and it took me a few seconds to realise he was speaking English

I think it's likely that's how they come to the conclusion

In fact, that’s the case for everything that isn’t a t-shirt or a jumper
Short tax, baby
I have no qualms with candles, those wax statues of public figures are disturbing though and I wouldn’t mind never seeing one again
I don't like Mandatory, but the community has a responsibility to protect the vulnerable which includes both children who cannot be vaccinated and the children of anti-vaxxers
You would need to exclude those kids not vaccinated from schools, and a lot of public spaces which would amount to child neglect by the parents by denying them a normal upbringing, so sort of enforced vaccination by the back door
Probably more honest to make it mandatory
Not my country but in france, Sour Patch Kids are called "Very Bad Kids" I just find it hilarious
I love hot weather
Been out to the park three days in a row
I’m cooking and I love it
I just sit in front  of the fan all day and I am fine
It's actually cold and rainy today, which is nice because our central heating system is STUCK ON
We can't turn it off, or down, because a little valve is jammed open
But all the plumbers in our area have everyone bar one guy on furlough, so unless you've actually got water spraying everywhere you're shit outta luck
I have got multiple fans on me
It helps but not enough
I end up sleeping in a dripping wet teeshirt to stay cool and it's dry within a few hours
It's fine
Windows are open (at least until this afternoon's lively thunderstorm)
The really annoying thing is that we did actually get a plumber out, he looked at it, told us what was wrong, bu couldn't come back because he's allergic to cats and we have one
Apparently he had quite a spectacular reaction
You'd have thought if you were *that* allergic that a) a job going into people's houses wouldn't be ideal; b) you might mention it to the house owner c) you might be alert to things lile giant cat trees right inside the front door and d) that your employer might find someone else to be the only non-furloughed plumber on staff
I can see that
(Just to be clear, we did not threaten our plumber with a cat, or anything else
It's been said that a yorkshireman is born with a flat cap on his head and a ferret down his trousers
Just for people who dont know; Hurling is a sport
No its literal
English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish people identity more as English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish than what they do as British
This is probably because England, Scotland, Wales and Northern are Ireland are considered countries inside a country, and have their own sports teams and governments
I identify as English first, British second and European third
I think British is more of an upper class identity
Understandable
Sometimes I wish I lived/studied/worked abroad or had an ethnic background from elsewhere so it gives me motivation to study another language
Languages are beautiful things, but I simply don’t know what to learn and don’t want to go ahead with a language only to find one I prefer over it and starting again
The closest I really have to a non-English background are some Welsh relatives, but they aren’t even blood and simply married into my family via my grandmother (see a relative like a step-grandad)
My grandmother’s maiden name was Esnouf which, according to her, is Scandinavian but that’s as far as it goes, no country in particular
That’s generally true with people from immigrant backgrounds
Black people and Indian people identify more as British since British is a nationality and English is an ethnicity
I feel we have the highest frequency of ugly cities in Europe
You can barely mention where you’re from online without someone calling it a shithole
Milton Keynes, Luton and Slough are probably considered the trinity of ugly
Birmingham
The most disgusting mishmash of random buildings
They don’t even look that bad lol, but in the U.K. Scunthorpe, Skegness, mablethorpe, slough, gravesend, Blackpool, Birmingham, Oldham, Liverpool, a lot of Kent
Basically a lot of the coastal towns specifically on the east coast of England are really poor and run down, and look awful
Blackpool is the poorest town in the U.K. I would say, Oldham is just known for being a shithole and Birmingham and Liverpool as they are quite big are not really as bad it’s more of like a joke that they are shitholes, but they still are quite bad and the accents are ugly as fuck imo
Preston:
Blackpool:
Jesus fucking Christ
A wetter and mildly more depressing Milton Keynes then
It's pretty clear why
We were the world's first industrial country, therefore most of our main cities were industrial and got destroyed by post war planners
Most of our ''ugly cities'' are in fact towns with industrial hertiage
Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham,  Coventry, etc all former industry cities
Most of them were built to be industrial
But we also have Durham, Bath, Oxford, Cambridge, York, Chester and tons of nice villages and towns
Yes, our main cities may not be the prettiest but they are often near country hills and green landscapes and a lot of them are going through regeneration
They're becoming much nicer places to live due to the post war buildings being revamped
Let me add Grimsby, Swindon and Gosport to that list
Granted they are towns but still
I also have a particular hatred for Basingstoke but its more bland than ugly
I can smell the picture
In contrast to most of wales that is ugly as hell
That's not a city though
Slight correction about Coventry
Coventry was actually our biggest medieval city and one of the most preserved medieval cities in Europe
Its thanks to the Luftwaffe and post war planners that its not in the same category as Bath or York
Coventry was redeveloped against its own wishes, due to being tragically flattened by the Luftwaffe
It also has the skydome which makes me happy
However, the ring road is truly something dystopian
Driving on it I feel it would feel more at home in Gotham (batman, not Notts little town) than in a mid sized British city
That's a town
And there's a really, really valid reason why they are ugly which some people fail to understand and know about
Anyone with knowledge of the Industrial Revolution and WW2 will understand why hopefully
Most of them were bad in the post war era and the 70s/80s - they've gone through regeneration and are becoming much nicer cities
Sadly, the stereotypes won't die away
I live in Huddersfield, its actually really picturesque with it being in the middle of a small valley
To be honest the majority of northern England is very pretty, even the major cities tend to have some really nice architecture from many different periods
A lot of it is down to how well its maintained
I'm originally from Preston in Lancashire, around 10 years ago it was honestly resembling a North Korean slum but has had so much money piled into it due to its growing reputation as the up and coming newest city in the UK, they've really turned it around
Edit: Huddersfield isn't a city lol
I'm moving down to Swansea next month and lemme tell ya, overall it's far prettier (and smaller) than the deprived hell scape that is most of urban South Yorkshire
Edit: (port Talbot is an eyesore though 100%)
Thanks bro lol
Birmingham also used to be quite nice with loads of Victorian redbrick gothic, but it was all knocked down in favour of brutalism and motorways
Huddersfield is split 50/50 between nice little villages in the hills and runned down areas a mile away from the town centre
As a result of that though, the town centre is pretty shit and has a fair bit of crime and a lot of chavs
Pretty much no one takes learning a language here seriously which is a massive shame
Think it’s a mix of most places speaking English as a second language and not starting it early enough in schools
Whenever I’ve tried to speak French when I’ve been there people just answer in English like cmon lads at least let me try lol
Its a great place
Although I can't say I miss it haha
I had no idea
I feel for all the other stations as St Pancras is leaps and bounds ahead of Preston haha
The bus station in Preston was the biggest bus station in Europe when it was built
I'm not sure what grade but I know its a listed building
Ive been to both Rome and Naples and i get what you are saying
The city centres are beautiful (if terrifying to drive in), but the suburbs are unbelievably ugly
Then as soon as you are out of the city limits the backwater towns and villages become beautiful again
It is a new town that was built based on American Post-war urban design principles I.e built with the automobile in mind
They did this in Birmingham with the old [library] but the new one hardly looks any [better]
Yeah the 60s brought a lot of great cultural icons, but it also has a lot to answer for with its stack-‘em-high, build-‘em-cheap architecture
Maybe it’s the public space
In American cities people seem to live half their lives in their own cars and suburban, if you’re so used to urban space being private and occupied exclusively for and by you you’re gonna treat it as your own and give fewer fucks about acting weird
In Europe so much of city life you’re acutely conscious of sharing space and trying to do as little as possible to inconvenience others
It’s not just about greater use of public transport
If I walk down a street in London I can see cars, cycle lanes, tube stops, multiple buses, shops on either side of the pavement with terraced housing above, more apartments, council housing leading into council estates, and loads of other people trying to get past me on the pavements
Millions of different people trying to navigate through the city and use it for other purposes
If I walk down a street in LA I can see two lanes of traffic filled with SUVs, lots of empty lots or condos back from the street side, parking, the occasional strip mall or gas station and nobody else on the side walk making me feel like a weirdo anyway
When everybody seems siloed away in their own buildings or cars, every other person on the sidewalk I’m gonna be wary of and think them weird
People abusing prescription medication seems to be a thing in the US, while almost non-existant elsewhere
Could that be a contributing factor
That is weird
You know something’s expensive when the Scandinavian’s are complaining about the price
The guy on the raft is fucking toasted, I mean absolutely gone
That picture looks like a scene out of a Quentin Tarantino film or something
Also that priest with the sunglasses is absolutely nailing the badass, cool af Hollywood action star pose
He looks more like a wild west gunslinger than the cowboy to his right does
Does the pries in the middle have his eyes shut
Maybe just a severe squint
Please tell me why they're shooting a ribbon
What did the ribbon do
If you haven’t caused a scene on a Friday night have you ever really lived
Ah, a balloon
Now it makes perfect sense

North East England, it has the suicide and drug overdose rate of Scotland, is more impoverished than Northern Ireland and Wales, has 1 of the lowest rates of forest cover in Europe and has poor transport links with the rest of the UK; overall it is a grey urban hell in need of massive regeneration
Northern Ireland
Laws passed always take forever to get through to there and many of them don’t even want to be part of the country
> to top it all off theyre being invaded by scousers
Fate worse than death
I think the problem with Eastern Moldova is that the cities there are shitholes and the transport is fucked
The countryside is beautiful, people are mostly nice (the Moldovans are nice, the 'Transnistrians' are mostly arseholes), and they have fantastic wines and Cognacs, as well as good fresh produce, but nobody from richer countries will travel there because of the effort
After going to the Moldovan cities, Bucharest was a serious upgrade
**Tiraspol is the single worst city I have been to in my life,** I mean the place is better maintained than Chisinau, but you literally cannot relax there, I mean I didn't go there to relax, I went there to see all of Russia's dodgy shit, but the people are really hostile (like we had a local guide and even then the Priests were chasing the tour group out of monasteries even though we paid to visit etc, had to rust out of 3 different bars)
On the plus side, it's the cheapest place I've ever seen, and they have roads which actually exist on their side of the river
Chisinau has nice parts, I liked the museums of Dacian history and stuff, but the city outside of the very very centre (which is nice) is totally fucked, like, there are buildings falling down everywhere there
The main problem is the transport tbh, Moldovan roads barely exist, they are bumpy as hell, and the train from Chisinau to Bucharest is grim, even if you get 1st class like us, luckily we just got completely drunk on Moldovan wine until we got to Bucharest so it was fine, but it's a really bad train, like a Soviet train from the 1970's without repairs
We can swap you for some of ours if you want\*
\*definitely not desperately trying to offload Pitcairn onto unsuspecting Frenchmen
I'm not remotely convinced by the arguments that a place like the North East isn't economical for the government to invest in
Tyne and Wear is a metropolitan area of 1
1 million people, the 6th largest in the UK, it has historical significance within Northumbria and has great education institutions with Durham, Newcastle and Northumbria University
Yes investing in a place like London or Birmingham will yield a higher profit margin in the short-term but Tyne and Wear is still profitable and its important to reduce regional inequality to ensure political stability
But the over-arching solution to the North East is simple, greater infrastructure spending and regeneration projects
The fact that the whole region has a single motorway going in, the A1(M) really says enough; its just neglect
Mayotte looks incredibly bad from a quick search
Worse than Monsterrat (our worse overseas territory) but they at least had a volcanic eruption which destroyed their capital city
Because the region is impoverished and a part of reducing poverty is increasing the economic efficiency of the area
I know about this because I researched my family history, and one of my direct ancestors was a British soldier sent to the Vendee on a covert mission to help the loyalists
I wish I was that cool
I'd just like to say that no one I know thinks of him as a hero
Most people remember him as someone who banned dancing and Christmas carols, so more like a Turkmenbashi sort of figure than a hero
I will admit most don't know about the invasion of Ireland, however
He isn't considered a hero here at all
He's considered as a regicidal dictator who hated fun and banned Christmas
He was disliked so much that people welcomed the monarchy back with open arms when he went
Because Irish people (rightly) learn so much about Britain's invasions of Ireland as it has played such a major part in Irish History this belief that in the UK we all apparently learn the opposite and that we somehow sit around celebrating this history is just bizarre
I cannot stress how much the likes Cromwell are just complete vague figures of history to the British public
The idea that he is a hero is laughable, most people wouldn't be able to tell you who he even was and a significant number will say he was bad person
I know its probably weird for you to hear this but in the UK the history with Ireland isn't really seen as that important at all and its rarely (if ever) thought about
Most people are either unaware or just dont have any opinions about it
A statue which was hugely controversial even many years before it was built many people rejected the idea
Basically was only built because the PM paid for it himself
Les not pretend that the people had anything to do with this nor that average brit has even given a fuck about him the past 300 years
I think that's just a wry reminder from parliament to the monarchy about who is really in power
The average bloke definitely doesn't think he's a hero
Somebody like Churchill, definitely, but not Cromwell
I still dont understand where you're getting this idea from
I've seen Irish users on Reddit say Cromwell is loved because there's roads named after him or something like that
Could be that
I used to live near a street called Cat Brain Hill and i'll you this for a fact, cat brains are not heroes
The most famous Cromwell Road would be the one in London with the V&A etc on it, its actually named after Oliver's son because he used to live on it
takeaway on a weekday
idk if that's just my family but takeaway nights were Saturday nights and even now it feels wrong to have fastfood during the week
another one is turning on the interior car lights while it's being driven, my dad used to lose his marbles when we did that, but i dont think that's necessarily specific to my culture
I revel in it
"Oh this thing
I picked it up from a little German number down the street
She's cheaper than you and I get things from her I simply can't get from you
But I'll do you a favour and buy a little here too"
I'm only straight pimpin' when it comes to Supermarkets
FYI "cutting the cheese" is a slang term for farting
Real ale in old fashioned British pubs used to be served in ceramic tankards too
This used to be a thing in Northern English; [Yan Tan Tethera]
I heard that it was because the Anglo Saxons were the peasants that farmed the animals, and the Norman's were the ruling class that only ate the meat, and that's why animal names are of Anglo-Saxon origin and the meat names are French
Winter time; solar noon is closer to regular noon then
Queen Elizabeth sends birthday messages to anyone who is turning 100 or 105
She also sends congratulation messages to people’s 60th, 65th, or 70th wedding anniversaries
I’m not too fond of the royal family but I do think this is a pretty wholesome thing
That’s amazing
I didn’t even think we’d end up offering them ILRs
Big up to whoever made that decision
Ireland was indeed the first country to legalise same-sex marriage by public vote
Manchester, England
Palermo, Sicily
Mediterranean climate, renaissance architecture and mafia
Venice
But futuristic so there's roads
London or Moscow 100%.
Just literally *that* kind of tourist from every country
0/10 unless the German tourists and British tourists start drunk fighting
>The ones that head on stag dos or to drink a year earlier (legal age is 17 for hard liquor) then yes, we do get chavs
Tbh at least they are more respectful of everything than they are in Amsterdam (probably because you left such a big impact that some British norms are ingrained in Maltese culture now, and it’s easier for them to adapt)
That isn't Chavs, chav teenagers drink from the local offie, the 17 year olds who go to Malta to drink are middle class/rich kids generally, you need good money to go Malta on the piss at that age
The retired blokes are sometimes ex Navy, but also mostly not Chavs, Chavs go to Spain
I feel like this shouldnt need to be said but often on reddit i see people complaining about how much of a rip off touristy shit restaurants in Zone 1 in London are
Do not go to the chain restaurant in most of the most touristy places in the world, whether it is New York, Paris, London etc etc
Actually blows my mind that people will come onto reddit and complain that they went to an awful restaurant on Oxford Street and paid lots of money for a shit experience, what did you expect
Might as well go complain that you had to queue to see the Mona Lisa
Like with all touristy places, do your research, do not just expect to be able to find something good and affordable
When I went to Lapland in Finland it wasn’t super touristy
One gift shop along an hour road to the airport
Seeing Father Christmas was a bit touristy but it is what it is
And the husky/reindeer rides just seemed like the Lapland version of Blackpool
The industry was clearly tourist related but it didn’t feel horrible and monetised like some places do
Awww I liked Loch Ness when I went
Also wasn’t busy at all
Sporting events aside, I genuinely can't tell why people go to London for tourism
> Some tourist activities like going on a boat along the Seine will also empty your pockets really quick
Every time I go to Paris I just pay like €19 for a 48 hour pass on the Batobus
No idea why anyone would pay a more expensive price for a 1 or 2 hour boat trip
I went as a kid and thought the tower was great
The beefeaters are pretty decent guides
I’ve been to Paris 4 times - twice in winter and twice in summer
Definitely enjoyed the experience during the winter far more, due to there being 90% less tourists
I love the atmosphere in London
I’ve done a lot of the touristy stuff but there’s still more to do
I was in Venice last summer and think it was €30 for a 48 hour vaporetto pass
Might sound expensive but that got us all round Venice and to Murano and Burano
It was definitely worth it for me
I wouldn’t even dream of paying €80 for a 1 hour gondola ride though
Maybe if I won the lottery and had money to burn
Right settle a debate for me then
Is it pronounced rhyming with "idea" or with "India"
I could be wrong, but wouldn't a late 19th Century Transylvanian nobleman br more likely to speak German or Hungarian anyway
> William Wallace wasn't a Highlander in a kilt, he was a medieval noble in chainmail riding about on a horse, like a knight
The film also left out the fact that he was a gay paedophile
And we're the villains in everything else
You’re in the Vatican
ahh makes sense to me, have a good one
Don't forget Outlander, the completely unrelated movie about aliens invading Iron Age Norway
That Great Thunberg and Madeline McCann are the same person (They were born in the same year) and Madeline was kidnapped by Greta's Swedish parents and had her name and identity changed
I can believe that Magyars are from outer space to be fair
I agree
My gf did Erasmus and yet she has settled for some balding pisshead from her own town rather than some charming Italian or Greek chap
I write it as

That’s why I lengethen the r to the right by a little then loop it and then you can do any letter

Wierd how that is
Not something we can joke about about without really offending some people
Not exactly, but we do think of the French as cheese eating surrender monkeys
As far as I'm aware, the main jokes are: 'We used to rule the world, you know' \*swigs beer while watching the news\*
and
'They'll be begging to come back any day now
Let's build a wall

The largest group is actually English but the descendants of English people tend to identify as American only
A lot of people also don't know they have a lot of English ancestry and families cling onto their small Irish, German, Norwegian etc roots
The vast majority of product prices I see in England are put on in the shop (either on the shelf or as a sticker on the product)
So it's not difficult
In the UK we have that
It’s because of the Equalities Act, to make sure minorities aren’t being discriminated against,
I also find it weird when Americans with English roots describe themselves as Anglo-Saxon
“Especially the British press had a bad habit of taking it a bit too literally
I mean that’s just true in general
Whilst not entirely a secret, I feel Bristol is pretty overlooked
Don’t usually see many tourists there other than groups of like French school kids on a trip
What
Its like a major tourist destination
I member going there decades ago to avoid Florence but it was still touristy
Just about every single guide to Tuscany/Italy says Siena is a must do
In Vietnam back at Christmas one of my Icelandic pals I met there told me how the population would triple during summer months from sheer tourism, and how him and his mates' best kept nature secrets where discovered and ruined by travel bloggers and tourists
Was genuinely gutted to hear, I'd love to see Iceland but don't want to add to the human mass that arrives every year
Dammit I saw Dundee uni as an option and went for Edinburgh instead (they said no boo)
Wish I saw this first
Haha
I remember reading that at least one Australian Aboriginal dialect has the word "dog" for a dog
My favourite with Polish/English is "no" meaning "yeah" and "yeah" sounding quite like "nie", can get a bit confusing when speaking Ponglish
The biggest thing that tripped me up when I began learning German was that 'Ich will
' is not the same as 'I will
' and is instead 'I want
Lots of discussions have gone on about the obsession in the UK with news from the US
Far more time is given to news from the US than from other European countries and sometimes even more than our own national stories
Especially with the upcoming US election our news coverage is currently at least 20% about the US, sometimes at much as 75% of the nightly news will be about the US
This has lead to many problems especially as many people seem to think that the police here in the UK are going around killing people just like they do in the US
I wouldn't say 'overwhelmed' but I really couldn't care less about American politics
It's often the leading news story (I think partly to slip the news about how badly Britain's government is doing under the radar)
News in England is often about the USA, especially when talking about celebrities
We have a weird obsession with American TV and American celebrities
The USA dominates, unless it’s on UK specific outlets
Can we have boring news please
We misaimed and got depressing instead
Jersey has British channels with Channel Islands locality (for the local news segments) so lots about Britain and the other islands but less about France
the Scandinavian countries look cool and some statistics show that they're pretty happy places too
I've always wanted to live in a small town in germany
Either Switzerland because of its high quality of living, or Italy because of the beautiful climate and picturesque views
They just weren't bothered that people could understand them
Chances are nobody is going to hear who knows the man's girlfriend
British people are generally aware that many people in Europe speak English
It's rare someone English would speak in English rudely/about something private assuming nobody around them speaks English
I think they probably just didn't care
Pretty much
As far as I'm concerned he earned himself a big payday
I never heard of or seen those, and I never knew the "normal" one was French
Yes, I (used to before lockdown) play with these cards with my half-Italian friend
We would play scopa a lot
It's the only reason I know these cards exist but it's a nice bit of culture that I wouldnt have known
When I went to Italy I bought two of these packs
Definitely
If it gets the 4/5 then ill think about putting a jumper on
Same tbf
Never thought I’d see an Australian jealous of the European climate
I live in southern England, the hottest summer days are usually around mid to late 20’s and the coldest winter days are usually around 0-5 degrees
The real darkness here starts in late October when the clocks go forward
Suddenly sunset is around half 4 in the afternoon, and gets earlier and earlier until the winter solstice in December where the sun rises around 8am, and sets around 3:50pm (not even 8 hours of daylight)
Usually the build up to Christmas isn’t too bad cos you’re focussing on that, you go to your work parties and do the late night Xmas shopping under the Xmas lights
Then suddenly it’s January
I HATE January and February
It’s cold and wet, the skies are just grey constantly
No sun, no colour
Grey
Everything is grey forever
The ground is permanently wet
You keep your head down and get through those two appalling months, then March (which sometimes gives you a bit of actual sun, but the wind tends to spoil any enjoyment)
Then the clocks go back, suddenly you’ve got an extra hour of sunlight in the evening
You hit April and Easter and suddenly it’s getting lighter and the temperature’s going up (we’ve actually had some ridiculously hot days already this year considering
Since Easter we’ve had a lot of 15-20 degrees days
This is when the year *actually* starts
Colour comes back, the sky is blue and everything is green and good
At the height of summer the sun will rise at 4:45 and set at nearly half 9pm
Over 16 hours of daylight
We have christmas to look forward to and christmas themed activities to do
I don't even have an issue with it getting dark early, just that I'm waking up in the dark and when I get back from work its dark
Spending all daylight hours in a bleak office is emotionally draining
7 for 18+, but alot of people under 18 smoke around me
in 2018 it was around 15% but that number was declining rapidly and with Covid that number has fallen even further
Most people I know who smoke are what are called 'social smokers' and in they will only smoke when they are in the pub drinking or maybe have a cigarette after a meal when alcohol is drunk
It quite rare to need a smoke break or whatever when working here unless they're from overseas
We have terrible health here in the UK where obesity is fast becoming normal but we seem to have been really great at cutting cigarettes in recent years
The ban on smoking inside in 2007 had a great effect on everyones health
Also, younger smokers in my experience tend to prefer rollies (rolling tobacco) and cigarettes are more for the older generation
Every animal on the planet, apart from humans, runs away from smoke
It's the most ridiculous thing to inhale smoke - and the damage it does, oh Jesus Christ
It stinks, costs a fortune, makes the person smoking look a low-life and a bit thick - and is very, very unhealthy
Newly released figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that around 7
2 million people, or 14
7% of the UK population aged 18 years and above, smoked cigarettes in 2018
This marks a decline of more than 5% since 2011
England had the lowest percentage of smokers at 14
4%, while Scotland had the highest at 16
3%. The percentages in Wales and Northern Ireland were 15
9% and 15
5% respectively
Apparently, it has gone down further since COVID kicked off
Yeah, all my Italian colleagues smoke
Like I wouldn't recognise most of them without a coffee in hand and a cigarette in the other
Maybe they just hold them for the image
I knew people that started smoking in year 6 but there was a few
Early hugh school was the biggest wave
Us Brits feel your pain
The Cyrillic alphabet is actually Byzantine/Greek in terms of its origin and it's first usage before spreading to other parts of the world iirc
Whenever an American TV show mentions the UK, they say England and it annoys me greatly
No one asked you
Except they're mostly Chinese
Fucking hate plastic paddies with a burning passion
why use the scandi cross on the flag
You’re in ask Europe mate
No one asked you no one wants your answer
Congrats on living up to the stereotype tho
Well yeah he’s asking Europe what our pet peeves Are
The UK is the largest exporter of medical marijuana
hell yeah
Combined
That really is surprising
Cant they hold something like 150% of the swiss population
God, we are so fucking dumb
Baked beans gang
TIL
What the hell
It's almost 3 times as much as the rest of the world combined
Absolutely mental
bean boyz fo’ life
On what
Not really in uk I feel like people would disapprove here because there are not many beaches that are both nice and also sunny so at the nice beaches there are also a lot of children so I don't think they would let them
Sorry for rubbish grammar I'm not very smart
Theres nothing fun about that fact haha
Deffo not zero in the UK
As everyone is saying it’s not super common, and perhaps even less than in other parts of Europe, but no way is it zero
I once saw someone sunbathing topless at fucking Skegness of all places
Grim
I dont think i've ever seen it in the UK unless they're lying down on their stomach
Yeah me neither
I wouldn't even go topless in my garden incase the neighbours see, nevermind at the beach lol
I know a lot of women here who think the same
They sound like absolute weirdos tbh mate
Gooogling it is one thing but to bring it up to you is just odd
I’m an english speaker but I can’t understand anything before middle english
I can understand scots perfectly though
To any one reading if you want to find out more about the Saxons and hear what Old-English sounded like, there's a great 3-part BBC series called
King Alfred and the Anglo-Saxons
Its a good watch and relevently it has alot of Old-English fluently spoken in it(via the Saxon contempory sources at the time of the events, its reciting them in the original language), its spoken Old English with Modern English subtitles
Yeah, I think people who understand Germanic or Norse languages have an easier time understanding it than us, because that's what it is tbh
It's totally meaningless to me as an English speaker
Yeah, it looks very Icelandic to me, would be interested to know
In a couple of weeks (5th November) in the UK we have "bonfire night" which celebrates an attempt by Guy Fawkes and others to blow up the Houses of Parliament
What holidays/festivals does your country have that have an interesting story behind them
I’m do excited for it and the fireworks and the sparklers
That's interesting, what's the history behind it
And they were only deciding what they were gonna order for lunch
The fella in the red tie really fancied a number 11 from the local chinese
He mutters, bumbles and stutters every time there's a microphone in front of him
Doesn't help that he's hamming it up for the cameras
Where do I begin
You know, none spring to mind…
I'm English so erm
> Genocide of multiple indigenous peoples in the Americas and Asia
Australia too
We also tested nuclear weapons in the outback and didn't bother to evacuate all the Aboriginal people first
Creating America
In my honest opinion, probably participation in the Scramble for Africa
We just obliterated numerous cultures and nations and redrew the lines, and oppressed the native people for as long as we could
Oh dear .. Africa and India probably
The Indian raj or or something else our fucked up empire did
indian famine, conquering 70% of the world
I'd argue the boer concentration camps weren't supposed to be as bad as they turned out
Most of the starvation was due to bad supply lines which the boers actually sabotaged
Now go hang your head in shame
Was that a joke
Of all the people, Cliff Richard
Not Piers fucking Morgan
Agreed
I hear it all the time on reddit how our empire is "glorified" in our education
I never learned one thing abut the empire in school
The opposite, Sunday funday - go to the pub get drunk and forget about the upcoming week
Sundaysesh
Gu on lad
- Summer and Winter Solstice is probably the most ancient tradition we celebrate
It is certainly not unique to us but its been around for thousands upon thousands of years
- St George's Day and his feast has also been celebrated here for around 1000-1500 years but became a prominent national holiday following the Crusades
- May Day, a fair amount will be familiar with the tradition, its not overly popular here, it seems to be mostly celebrated in the South
- Halloween has its origins in Celtic traditions and we obviously celebrate it but we have a few local traditions, customs and festivals that are likely to have a similar origin: Punkie's Night in Hinton St George, Soul Caking in Cheshire, Hoodening in the east of Kent, the Allendale Baal Fire etc
> carrying a piece of unwrought iron with me
I wonder if that's got the same origins as cold iron keeping evil spirits away
Some kids go around with a fake Guy Fawkes in wheelbarrows and ask for a Penny for a Guy but this part of it died of
[Found this ]
Harvest festival is probably our oldest tradition and will date back till prehistory in one vein or another
Parts of england are further north than parts of Sweden
Hello from Britannia
So those parts arent Scandinavia
Brit who doesn't like tea here
I mean, I don't hate it, it's drinkable, I just rarely choose to do so since I'm not that keen on it
I’m a Brit that doesn’t like tea or full English breakfast
I’m sorry
Brit who doesn't like football
Cricket is better
Don't fite me
Same
Much prefer cold drinks
I do drink tea from time to time, just not super often
Can we swap
*This is legally binding, I've been looking for a way out of this mess since summer 2016*
Oh, I fit that one too then haha
Might want to put an ‘s’ on the end of ‘support’. Atm it reads sort of as the opposite of what I think you’re trying to say
Yeah, who associates *espresso, cappuccino or latte*s with Italians
Yeah I mean mostly I just drink water
Sometimes milk too, but between them that's like 95% of what I drink
No need for tea
The drink haha :)
I said in another comment it's just normal black tea I don't like
I actually do quite like green tea and herbal teas
I've never really liked potatoes either, in any form really
Sometime I don't mind certain chips but they're not something I especially like and would choose to eat normally
I still love a Sunday roast though, no potatoes for me but lots of parsnips instead :)
Just
Just don't.
I feel like punching someone and there's a 52% chance it would be justified
Ludicrous display
Ah no, never watched it
I don't mind a bit of TV sometimes
I'll have a look and see if it's the sort of thing for me :)
Cheers for the link
I think I'll check the series out
In English we don’t have genders, also a common saying is ‘the man in the moon’, so I’d assume it’d be a man
I think I sort of see how it might occasionally be personnified as female in a poetic sense but there's also the colloquial idea of 'the man in the moon' which would be in conflict with that
I think it's hard to say definitively one way or the other
Probably because of Britannia
I've noticed that before a few times as well
I don't think it's very common in regular speech, it's got a bit of an old fashioned feel to it, but it is a thing
Perhaps
The female personnification does have a classical kind of Roman/Greek feel to it to me which the man in the moon lacks
So you've got the two contrasting personnifications depending on the way you're looking at it
The British empire
As long as you were upper class
It was shit for everyone else
Probably late 1800s to ww1, the last 2 decades or so of Victoria and can’t remember who took over from her
We literally ruled the whole world and we’re by far the richest, most powerful country, it wasn’t really until suez that we lost it along with France
Big time
As another poster says, it’s amazing how many working class people view this as the golden age
I remember studying a northern city during the industrial era in history class, the average age of mortality in the 1850s was 20 years of age
We were shown a photograph of a 12 year old girl from later on in the century who’s shoulders were down at the same height as her chest due to carrying heavy shit around on them 12 hours a day, 6 days a week since she was 4 years old
Ireland was part of the UK back then, and when the potato crop failed in the 1840s, the authorities response was to export the rest of the food leading to mass starvation and emigration, to such an extent that Ireland is the only country in the world that has a lower population today than it had back then
It was the golden age for 1% and a bunch of gullible idiots think that means it was the golden age for the whole country
What
The Elizabethan era has commonly been refereed to as 'The Golden Age' for ages
This is all pretty much pre empire when the 'new world' was only just being discovered
Paris
Really ruined my expectations of the city
Beggars and thieves everywhere, can't go to any of the monuments or famous places without being hassled by people trying to sell you miniature Chinesium versions of said places
Didn't like the food but that's due to my own personal preferences and I can't blame the Parisians for that
Not really a horror story but I didn't like the city at all
I was fairly young when I went though, so maybe I should give it another shot now that I'm older and have a bit more agency over which parts of the city I visit
lol my dad did the same "there's some twat on the wrong side of the road
Oh shit it's me
Oh the french
Same, no one saying shit about England, that’s new
Using hotels and hostels as homeless shelters is very common in the UK, most councils do that
The thing people in Europe underestimate is that Brits are massive cheapskates when it comes to things like travel and food, I mean I've stayed in an EasyHotel (private double room with a private bathroom etc too) for £19 for one night in outer London, and while that's an extreme example, there's loads of cheap chains like EasyHotel, Travellodge, JD Wetherspoon etc
You can get nice hotels etc here if you want, but they'll cost you, and it's likely you'll get massively ripped off if you turn up on the day without a booking
The hotels that are used for the homeless are not always the cheapest ones either, there's one in my city that advertises at £80 a night that is actually only ever used by homeless people, but there's a good chain hotel that isn't, which is much nicer, nearby that charges £30-40
Not a city but the lake district is stunning
It’s normally only visited by english people though
> English ppl are cold
That's a stereotype
You can also get anywhere easily from London :) I agree, the rest of England is very underrated
Check these out  and
I have friends from other nations who really loved the rest of England and found English people very polite and loving
It's a shame people judge England for London which is a brilliant city but it's not a fair overall picture of the country
I disagree Windermere is always packed in the summer season
Id say some of the lesser known lakes and maintains in the lake District are less touristy but certainly not Windermere
Chester is very busy in the summer months with tourists, last time I flew back from Spain it was even encouraged to goto Chester on billboards in the airport with pictures of the streets etc
Sort if the same for Shrewsbury but not as busy
Telford isn’t really a tourist town at all
> Portsmouth, Plymouth
Those two dont deserve to be in that list IMO
Pretty sure they meant 'as a people' as in, we can be quite unwelcoming
Yes
A very common steryotype across the world
Like we're judgey and aloof
I live next to the peak district
It always looks really pretty in winter when it snows on the hills but not in my actual village
Great walks up there too
Tbh there isnt really anything in Telford for tourists although I like visiting for shopping as everything is central
The new buildings by Asda and Wilko are quite nice to go if staying overnight
Other than that its just a mirror of every other town minus the huge amount of empty stores
Don’t like the perfume they wear though
Bournemouth has a nice beach, and thats about it
I dont think tourists come here for our beaches
> The city itself is pretty nice
What
Bournemouth
What
I’m from England so I’m pretty lucky cause I don’t need to learn English, but I’d say Spanish because one of the places I could move to is America where obviously that’s really common, also actual Spain is another main option for somewhere to move to
Depends which country you’re working in, but overall I’d say Russian, French and Spanish
Not in England, but it should be the case
> Blackpool is apparently some sort of a ghost town and not British Hollywood as I initially thought
Im sorry what
Why the hell do people not from the UK even know Blackpool exists
> Germans and Swiss really are living stereotypes when it comes to giving overly detailed answers
Yes
I find it actually quite confusing when reading some answers here
Like I'm expecting to find some hidden meaning or explanation to something complicated because who would write 6 paragraphs on a simple subject unless there was a hidden message or something, but no its just a German explaining how they like to wear a hat
And Turks
Isnt Germany like the most popular country in Europe for Turks
Not that common anyone - i dont think
And only like super trashy chain nightclubs
Also, you never went to a nightclub whilst underage
Are you sure you're British
Im pretty sure they make pretty decent money tbf
Ah, how unsurprising
Boggles my mind why the west hasnt realised that you cant bring in people like Putin or Erdogan
They're not going to see our way of life and think 'oh that looks great maybe i'll stop being such a cunt' - They will always continue to be utter twats
Why must you Nordics be so happy
Save some for the rest of us
We've got quite a few but another one I don't see many people mentioning is Andrew Wakefield
He was the doctor who said that the MMR vaccine causes autism
Ask the rest of the country, it’d be Adolf hitler
For me personally it’s George V
If you base the most hated person in Britain solely by Redditors opinions it would be boris Johnson
He's not a national hero at all
He's seen as a despotic puritan who hated fun, banned christmas and was such a tyrant that the people welcomed a king back with open arms
Morgan is fairly reasonable and in line with the general public opinion on a number of issues
But he’s also just a total cunt
Undeniably a complete and utter cunt
A rude, self-satisfied, over-confident, privileged, ham-faced prick
Thatcher is like marmite - loved or loathed
I would argue that shes more hated than loved despite me being a cautious supporter of hers but she’s not the number one
Saville has to be in the top 10 of everyone’s list and that alone should be enough to be the most hated
Utter prick
Could William the Bastard feature
I reckon most of our population is too unaware of history to really hate him but they really should
They had street parties and bonfires and even paraded an effigy through the streets before lobbing her in the bonfire here in Yorkshire
Not that hard
English grammar is generally nice and simple
Accent is much harder to fake
The only non-native English speaker I’ve encountered who could do a legitimately passable English accent was a French girl I once met who spent years working on it
She was so glad that l was impressed
She said she worked really hard on it
ծ is /t͡s/, ճ is /t͡ʃ/, for English speakers ծ is similar to “ts” but pronounced as one sound, like you would “Ch” which is made up of “t” and “sh”.
ճ is “ch” like in “Cheese”.
At least according to the Wikipedia article for the Armenian language
In the world wars
The bbc allowed non RP speaking broadcasters because regional accents are just so hard to imitate
It’s really hard
English has too many accents, so we have to choose one first
Then memorise all words we already know in that accent and research thoroughly any new word we may bump into
I’ve been trying to master received pronunciation for yyyyears and progress is well slow
I’m an immigrant btw, I’m trying my best to adapt and become indistinguishable from a brit
But it’s hard to tell how far we get, since we depend on feedback a lot
We exist, don't worry
I'd say from learning Spanish for several years that intonation is definitely the hardest part of perfecting spoken language
I never noticed how flat English is when spoken, especially compared to Spanish
Yes i would love this to be standard
There have been so many efficiencies in my industry but we still work the same hours largely
I would be happy to work the same hours, 37
5hrs, each week but over 4 days
I’m an accountant, working the 9-5 life
Though it’s generally more than that
Having a 3 day weekend would be amazing
Weekend day 1 get on top of chores etc, weekend day 2-3 relax
I work a 7
5hr day and take a 30 min lunch break
So i work a 37
5hr week, but including the lunch break i would be at the office 40hrs
Can have an hour or more for lunch but would have to work until i hit that 7
5hrs
We are flexible though so i could work longer one day and finisher earlier another
General rule is we must start by 10am and earliest finish is 4pm
Yes, the French and Belgians for holding on long enough for us to get our army out of Dunkerque
You saved the lives of each and every one of them and possibly even our home
Thank you from everyone in the UK
The Irish for having to put up with us as neighbors
Thank you Norway for giving us a Christmas tree every year x
Big thanks to both Italy and France for the food and wine
Russia for being the bastion of revolution that started the Soviet Union which contributed so much to socialism
>Thank you Switzerland for being our second home for years
I'll also like to thank the Dutch for all your brilliant tourists in places like Switzerland, fantastic people to meet on a long hike or bike ride who are allways brilliant morale boosters
Last line of defence
Good old king billy
Oh for sure, reddit seems to think we have a Serbian-Albanian style hatred for each other
90% of users on r/Ireland are non-Irish trying way to hard to fit in
Always good craic when I've visited Ireland and most of us have Irish blood or relatives regardless
It's more our politicians and the nationalistic hooligans which are difficult to put up with
In the original comment you wrote Poland was the last line of defence
I'm not making some political point, it's just historically inaccurate to say poland was part of the battle of britian as poland was out of the war and under occupation
In the same vein Irishmen fought for the liberation of europe but ireland was firmly neutral
The servicemen should be proudly remembered of course but the nations were not involved
Haha, 303 squadron of the polish air force
Polish pilots, not poland
Historical inaccuracies are of course important
It's not a short cut, as it conveys a very obvious different meaning
Yes but if I try to sell my cheese as frnch when in reality france no longer exists and it was just made by a french dude, using British supplies, British kitchens, british bosses, british knives and British gas
I can hardly call
the cheese French can I? It was simply made by some french man
Who for all I know is a great chef
I dont think nationalities are official, I find that even more obtuse than the issue in question
It's just historically inaccurate to say Poland fought in the battle of britian
When they had ceased to exist as a country in that year
Okay let's make this simple, of course as a nation in exile they still existed
But as a nation in their rightful geography, capable of fielding a military, no they ceased to exist on that plane
If we compare this to Taiwan, in Taiwan with their Taiwanese military not counting their seat the UN table they still exist
however as the govt
Of China they are in exile and cease to hold their monopoly in that region
In layman's terms, poland has no guns, Poland was conquered, poland is gone
Polish people fled to britian and fought in the  British military
Yes of course
I am guessing it would be like the us and the U.K., Australia, Africa, etc
I’m not sure if English is weird or not for this, but I’d say I can understand perfectly fine someone from any country speaking English
That's remarkably close to English
I have always considered Dutch and English to be close relations
I understand some German too, and between German and English I can understand a lot of simple Dutch and Afrikaans writing
Spoken Dutch is harder, but when written down and read out phonetically, Dutch it often appears to be very heavily accented English
Daily because your government and corporations are endlessly trying to interfere with our lives (especially our healthcare) so US politics affects us
Hopefully when Biden is president we will get less
Because he won't make a fool of himself like trump does
Edit: Biden
God sake autocorrect
>larger than Andorra and the Isle of Man
the cool new metric
in the UK we used to use Wales for size, until they actually started complaining
Andorra is a good swop
Yeah, it was in the 00s i think but the term had been used since the 90s. Particularly with regard to deforestation
This lovely lot have flipped it on its head and protected an Area The Size Of Wales: “ An area the size of Wales’ is frequently used to measure the rate of forest destruction
Through Size of Wales, we are **turning that negative use of the country’s size on its head**.”
It was generally coupled with something depressing, so some of you lot said it wasnt welcome
I'd say there is more a of a Central/East/West/Southern/Baltic European identity
Some countries may belong to more than 1 of those areas
True
When I think of the standard "European" i think of mainly central Europe like France, Italy, Germany ect
I want to be included but I'm definitely just British lmao
It's like the old quote, 'America and the UK are two cultures separated by a common language'.
We focus on the discrepancies between us precisely *because* they are so small and specific
British people are honestly more similar to polish/greeks, the only reason people don’t think so is due to the language barrier
> Britain was apart of the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, which other European countries couldn't justify
But many other European countries could including Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Poland and I think Norway
I mean Ireland didnt even outwardly oppose the Iraq war and provided the US with airports for stopovers whilst talking about the need for good US/Ireland relations
Not necessarily overrated but London is the only city that really gets tourists
It’s overpriced, panders to tourists as well as the ‘British gimmick’ and is really crowded (still worth a visit though)
London is also barely representative of England and feels like a foreign country at times
You’ll get a much more authentic view of England if you visit other cities
I would say (kind of) the Louvre in Paris
Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great museum and a really amazing experience if you’re interested in art, but most people just go there to see Mona Lisa, which is the true disappointment
The painting is small and because of all the security around it you can’t even see it well, plus there’s a huge crowd surrounding it which makes you just want to see it for the sake of saying that you saw Mona Lisa and move on
Yep, I went to see it
Never been more underwhelmed
There are far more impressive statue and fountains really close by
Amsterdam wasn’t the prettiest city I’ve ever visited, but it was certainly one of the most fun
Define ‘better’
The only one of those cities I’ve visited is York, and
summer solstice festival is a pretty cool experience
I've been twice
A lot of the UK is like Slough unfortunately
I live in London and it is probably the best city on Earth
When I went to Germany in year 7 (or 8, not sure) we were explicitly told not to chant at any point "Two world wars and one world cup, doo dah, do dah
Wales and France
France and Germany
All of them
Europe lol
Little bit sad tbf
> I'd also point out that one of the most offensive British hand gestures is derived from showing the French we have two fingers to draw a longbow
Thats a known example of fake story
Like people will reference that story as something thats definitely not true but people once believed for a short while
Basically its an old wives tales
Essentially England and France meet up whenever their respective dysfunctional families start annoying them
I sometimes see Spanish people call us ''pirates'' online -- I wondered why and found out
Interesting though, because a lot of people here wouldn't consider Spain a rival
Ah yes
Geordies
Aren’t they they worst
Coming over here
Being all equatorial
God I hate them
why what happened
Hungary
Wtf
Because we really have nothing against the Dutch
Who hates the Dutch
Psychopaths that’s who
If you wanted us to stop you should’ve just said something
Friendzoned by Ireland, again
Probably because our tourists ransack Spain
The one world cup is referencing '66
It's the only football world cup final we've ever made it to I to I think, and we beat you (hence why it's referenced in the chant)
We recognise that the you've won several times, but not against us (although you've beat us in the earlier stages a couple of times)
I think only Brazil has had more success than you
The only thing that would have made '66 sweeter is if we had beaten France
To be fair, England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland are just one big dysfunctional family
I prefer Australian Champagne with my English Somerset Brie tbh
Who showers drunk
I once had to negotiate with an aggressively drunk flatmate who started deep-frying chips at 01:00 in a frying pan
It scared the shit out of the rest of us, but short of punching his lights out and tying him to his bed, he was going to get his damn chips
The rest of us intervened and took over actually cooking them in return for having some ourselves and not burning the block down
Definitely not
It's the last thing on my mind
I'd be too scared of slipping and cracking my head open
I know a guy (well, his whole family actually) who have chronically low blood pressure
My mum phoned him once and heard, "Hello" ***thump*** followed by 20 seconds of silence until he woke up on the floor
Standing up to answer the phone dropped him like a sack of shit
My very scared mother was on the verge of hanging up and calling an ambulance for him
Not a condition I'd like, for sure
For Northern Europeans the further away from 0 degrees and overcast the better the weather
Not necessarily
I hate hot weather aha, especially when it’s 40°+
French => English:
Travaille means work, not travel
Journée means day, not journey
Poisson means fish, not poison
Pain means bread, not hurt
Ennuyeux means boring, not annoying
And of course for the child in all of us, oui =/= wee
Those are a few I can think of off the top of my head
For some it's the pronunciation making them sound similar, for some it's the spelling
Edit: formatting
I quite like it yeah
Mostly probably because it's just what I've grown up with so I'm used to it but even so I don't have any problems with it here and no particular desire to move away
It's my home, you know, that sort of feeling
Whilst its not terrible and I do love where I live in a way, I’d like to move country outside of the UK if I possibly can in the future
Everything is just starting to bore me a bit, even if I haven’t seen everywhere in the country
Plus not vibing with our politics right now aha
Somewhere else, do I even need to explain
I like our actual country, the shit here, the people here, but if it was political, I would much rather live in anywhere else, probably somewhere like France or Spain
As soon as I’ve finished in school / am able to, i will probably move away, the only problem is brexit will have been finished by the time I can move, making it 10x harder
I’d love to move to Canada at some point (Toronto specifically) but I do love my home
I’ve always loved Canadian culture (especially hockey) and I love the weather and geography
They also have amazing people and good wages in the technology sector
It seems like utopia to me
Visiting Toronto was the biggest eye opener for me and made me decide I want a change in life
I love living in the UK but I want to enjoy life
I like it here but I want to move to Sweden , I don’t know why
You guys have a beautiful country too and unique culture, both of which I loved exploring
What stuck me most is the sense of community you have, at least that’s the impressive I got; visiting my then girlfriends family was a real pleasure and all the neighbours came out to join them for a BBQ
Haven’t felt that connection to my neighbours here in England, at least not for a quite a few years
pretty much the same here
Sounds rough : (
>  I don't like the debt culture
We have a debt culture
Good, we would have been conquered in ww1 and ww2 if we were in mainland, and us along with France and the rest managed to stop Germany from taking over the whole of Europe until America came in mainly because we were impossible to attack as we are an island
It is quite shit though how we need to take a plane / an expensive underwater train to go on holiday to another country, even island is unreachable by road
oh no he didn’t
That’s awful
Is Bulgaria better
Expensive too
There’s much cheaper cities up north where there is still plenty to do
One of the lucky ones I see, my brothers the same, he's a Swedish citizen now so will avoid all the shite we're dealt
Studying in STEM this September, hopefully I can land a place in the EU afterwards still
Failing that like you said, if Scotland gets independence I'd wanna get citizenship through my mum haha
I think that’s a very dramatic worst case scenario issue but I don’t think it will be as bad as you say it will be
Unemployment will rise a bit and maybe a slightly poorer economy but they’re the only bad issues I could see coming out of brexit in a realistic scenario
I guess it’s just time to tell us what’s going to happen
I remember there being a few around in the 80s, but they were definitely the butt of playground jokes along with Skodas and Yugos
They sold decently, being a cheaper alternative to the standard Ford/Vauxhall/Japanese saloons, but I don't think they were ever what I'd call popular
Skoda have come good - I drive a Fabia myself, which is basically a VW Golf with different bodywork IIRC - but Lada disappeared in the UK in the 90s. I think it was something to do with not being able to adapt to new emissions laws
What about that famous phrase ‘You’ll have had your tea
I moved from the UK to Portugal and it's *so* hard going from fairly standoffish greetings to the kisses
I keep forgetting, and then leave them hanging, or going for one when they mean two
A few times I've accidentally slammed my face into their face on the whip round for the second one
I got the hang of it eventually but it feels so unnatural
Love the Portuguese, and the country, but I got so relieved when I could meet up with English people and just do a quick semi-hug/handshake
My family always eats late (like 8pm or later) compared to everyone else but I don't really know why
Most British people at at about 6 I think
That’s weird
We don’t really do light beer here either, as far as I’m aware
Nothing compares too the school trip one
Nothing compares too the school trip one
oh, sweet child of mine
Naah it's super lukewarm
'Quite nice' is reserved for delapidated houses, and the first meal of your new diet
Hurrah for historical inaccuracy
As I recall Rapunzel's witch works out what's going on when Rapunzel tells her that her clothes don't fit anymore because her belly is growing
Boris Johnson would belly flop everyone there
An honest mistake
In the UK, cheers is interchangeable with thank you
In most countries on earth, it’s what you say before you drink alcohol
I distinctly remember saying salud to a Spanish shopkeeper, who’s probably staring at me like a madman as I walk out the shop with my purchases
Not sure if this counts as he'd lived in England since he was 10 but I had to dissuade a (presumably straight) Pakistani friend of mine from calling himself a "bear" in his Tinder profile
What height constitutes a mountain in the netherlands
From what I've read on here, what we class as a mountain is actually more generous than what most other countries class as a mountain
For me I distinguish between the words spicy and spiced
A curry with loads of chilli is hot and spicy
Mulled wine is spiced with cloves and cinnamon etc
American mustard is more vinegary than anything
English mustard would probably blow their heads off
Ah that's insane
I mean I think a height change would be a hill for me like a hill for me is a region of steep incline
I suppose 20m above sea level isnt high but it depends on how high above sea level the bottom is
Oh shit so 22 metre high is a mountain
I thought I was being generous calling the old man of Coniston a mountain when its elevation is 803m and prominence is 416m.
Ah shit I mean the Netherlands is le pays bas so makes sense
One of my biggest internal conflicts is that I am on a fundamental level a proud Englishman; I love English/British culture, history, food and drink, film and TV etc
There’s a lot of beautiful scenery and architecture here, and I’m so lucky to have been born so close to London where I now live
However, I’m also a generally left-wing liberal remain-voting European, and a republican, which is very much a minority opinion
My ideal for England, and the UK more broadly, may never come to pass, certainly not in my lifetime
And with Brexit I feel further from that ideal than ever
Genuinely feels lonely
I would say it's the English national pastime if it wasn't for those pesky southerners
Try a day out in a northern town
All in jackets you fairies
This is somewhat regional, but in parts of the North, men calling other men 'love' as a term of familiarity
As it is, a man will often call a woman love, like "thanks, love", or a woman will often call men or women love; but it's much rarer these days for a man to call a man love
It was more common in my parents' generation, and much more common in the generation before that
If I were to guess, it would be the growing acceptance of LGBTQ that caused a lot of men to essentially drop 'love' from what they would call other men as an implicit 'no homo'. When LGBTQ were just not talked about, then people didn't make that association
Huh, the name for that job in English is Tinker
They used to also mend pots and pans and stuff
Dead trade now, I think
Exact same situation here in Northern England, last decade or so the winters here have been getting more mild
However this year the temperatures plunged down to -10 and we've been getting a lot of snow, making me wonder if lockdown has effected air pollution enough to decrease the temperature
Yeah but you guys have also lost the hole in the floor style toilet in your campsites and service stations so its not all bad imo
My local chippy still does skin on fish
Sounds a bit like the UK, but in supermarkets
I don't get ID'd in pubs often, and never in restaurants - that is just not a thing
We have different laws for selling alcohol if it's accompanied by food
I still get ID'd in shops from time to time, especially if I am freshly shaven
It bothers me a tiny bit, but I understand why as the fines for selling to minors are very severe (up to £5000 fine or 6 months in prison)
The legal age to buy alcohol is 18, but many shops operate a voluntary "challenge 25" policy, which means they'll ask you for ID if they think you look under 25
Now, some cashiers interpret this to mean "Could he pass for under 25
", not "Does he look under 25
". Result: People who are around 30 like me, nearly twice the age necessary to buy alcohol, still get ID'd if they have a young face
Interestingly, now that we all have to wear masks in shops they seem to have stopped bothering to ask for ID
I like it when Northerners use the term 'duck'
I like it
I think we lost a part of our general friendliness in letting it disappear
I have the term 'toxic masculinity', but it does feel to be like people stopped using it because it sounded 'a bit gay'.
Yeah, super common in my grandparents' generation, less so in my parents', almost non existent now
Its 'me lover' where im from and that can really catch some off guard if they're not from the west country
That's kind of funny, considering the Soviets did the exact opposite with their tanks
I guess it shows where their priorities were
In the UK "pissoir" is occasionally used as a mocking, fake-posh term for urinals
Especially the nasty ones
Us English like using fancy French words for things
It makes us feel sophisticated
There is the occasional lorry trailer with a slogan or passage written on the side, left in a field on the side of the road
Truly though, the religious landscape here in Britain is both incredibly deeply ingrained, and subtle because of it
We are a Christian country and function as such, so overt shows of faith are kind of unnecessary
We don’t really have billboards, esp not on highways
The only religious banners I’ve seen are on or around churches
To expand we didn't have many religious billboards until a few months ago when the whole country started getting littered with: anti-choice, pro-marriage, pro-church adverts
Lol as English speakers we don’t have that ability
All of the closest linguistic relatives to English are mutually unintelligible
The only exception I can think of is Scots
I’m English and don’t understand anything but English, sorry
Probably french because we borrowed alot of words
I would say I could understand about 20 to 30 percent of writing in a french newspaper
As someone moving to the Czech Republic before Christmas, I was under the impression they were really similar languages (ignorantly probably) because I worked with a Slovakian woman who said she spoke Romanian Polish Czech and Slovakian just 'cos' as she put it lol
Kinda blew my mind when being bilingual as an English person is impressive haha
Edit: spelling lmao
100% it’s hard to know what language to learn however I’m trying my hand at Czech and failing miserably haha although still enjoying it tho
Yeah its very similar most adjectives will have the same prefix and the suffix with change dependent on time location and gender from what I can gather
Sadly there's no formula like there is in English to remembering them its a case of just practicing and committing them to memory which I'm finding an interesting challenge if I'm honest
(Sorry I'm no expert in language so not sure I'm getting the terminology right but hopefully you understand
Are the suffixes always the same
If so is there something similar I can use as a template to practice
I always find asking how native speakers were taught a language to really help the process along
Oh yeah haha
Before another Brit jumps in with; Us too yeah our love of tea etc etc
Coffee has fast become a competitor to tea, not saying tea is in danger of being forgotten but its strangle hold over the hot drink of choice in the office kitchen isnt guaranteed
As its mixed with milk the taste is weaker but you also drink it in larger amount as most people drink it from a mug
As we're a cold country for most of the year its more a drink to warm you
Yeah turkish tea is also drank a lot here
I could walk out of my house now and I would pass maybe 15-20 turkish tea shops before i got to a British cafe
And curry sauce
And mushy peas
I would say so, yeah
It’s just associated with racism thanks to groups like the National Front and the EDL, which is sad
Instead of refusing to let these groups claim the monopoly on patriotism, a lot of liberal, progressive English people just decided to identify mainly as British, handing the claim to national pride to racists on a plate
So now it’s mainly just seen during sporting events
I have several flags, but I am weird
Well, kind of, often its weird to see an English/UK flag flown in windows of homes or on the street, unless its a sports event, because unfortunately it has been associated with the far right and groups like the EDL
Not the U.K. flag, but the England flag in Scotland, for example, would be weird
Also a lot of people who use the English flags are usually racist, like the edl for example
I’ve never lived outside of England so idk about other countries, but they probably have stereotypes like that as well
As a country not having a flag would be weird but when you see flags outside peoples homes my minds goes to them instantly being a racist
Which is a wrong thing to do I know
During a World Cup you see a lot my flying about
If someone has an England flag outside their house, they are usually one of the 3:
-The EDL (Far right racist group)
-Old people
-Sports fans when the world cup/euros are on
Same here
This is the same in England
I think this is perhaps a projection of your own surroundings than the truth
I think if you come from London, Bristol, Brighton, Liverpool or (less so) Manchester you might believe the English flag is associated with racism, but then people in those places view a great many things as associated with racism
I think the notion of Englishness upsets these people, or the desire to have any sort of national pride is viewed as abhorrent
EVEN THOUGH nationalist politics and parties has never really been that successful in England
Compare that to the rabid and public nationalism seen in Scotland the last decade, with nationalist parties ruling the country, which is met with applause from people in those very same cities
Very strange
In the region's it's a totally normal part of English identity
You do have that massive Portuguese flag in Lisbon
It's huge, I've never seen such a big flag in my life
Same here in England
Disgaree, in England, especially with the St George's Cross, there's a class element to it, working class pubs will fly the St George's Cross all year for example
Middle and upper class people frown on it however
Me too
Unfortunately for me the English flag has become ugly by association
When I see it I think of ugly boomer art involving Bulldogs, and racist larger heads walking around with no shirt on
I’d rather fly a UK flag if I HAD to fly a flag
That or something kinda innocuous like the Mercian flag (someone is bound to tell me why that’s not innocuous) for a bit of a laugh
You can’t just compare groups that call themselves nationalist like they’re they’re different flavours of the same thing
The word is being used in very different ways
There is an obvious difference between the far-right ethnic nationalism of groups like the NF and the EDL and the civic nationalism of parties like the SNP or Plaid Cymru, which are essentially just using the word to emphasise their support for independence
And btw, I’m not from any of those cities and I know exactly how the English flag and English identity are weaponised by fascist groups and the far-right
Pubs only really fly the St George’s Cross because of sporting events
>There is an obvious difference between the far-right ethnic nationalism of groups like the NF and the EDL
The peak membership of the EDL was 25k - 35k. That's 0
0005% of the population
That's the population of England that has managed to hijack the flag apparently
>And btw, I’m not from any of those cities and I know exactly how the English flag and English identity are weaponised by fascist groups and the far-right
So you simply must associate the tricolour with terrorism then yes
Surely that's fair based on your criteria
>There is an obvious difference between the far-right ethnic nationalism of groups like the NF and the EDL and the civic nationalism of parties like the SNP or Plaid Cymru,
Come off it
You think the SNP don't use the same dogwhistles pandering to petty nationalism in the Estates of Glasgow
The civic nationalism bullshit is a pretty cover that makes the undercurrent of anti English nationalism that represents their vote outside of liberal city centres
It was at the top of one of the main parks
And it was huge, it looked like it was the size of a football field
Cause you can put whatever you think as your country's "values".
We are defending the values of Poland as a liberal, European nation
We are defending the values of Poland as a strong, traditional, independent nation
In England, there's parts of the country where you will see the English flag flown (not in Gloucestershire though, very middle class area that)
If you go to cities like Sunderland or Portsmouth, then you'll see it more
The number of England flags directly correlates with the number of Leave voters tbh
It depends what part of the country you are in
I know some pubs in Pompey flew it for Brexit, and some just leave it up all the time
Wait what
It was trendy to be British at your school
The rest of the UK has those problems though
Acting like England is unique in that regard and unique when it comes to racism is stupid
I took mine along with my british and european flag to two anti-brexit marches
I’m not going to let it be wielded solely by the worst of our nation
It depends where within Portsmouth, it wouldn't happen in the tourist areas or student areas (Southsea, Old Portsmouth, near the ferry port), everywhere else in the city, I've seen it around, Fratton, Hilsea, Baffins, Paulsgrove, Weacock Farm, Copnor, Eastney etc
Areas with a high amount of tourists won't fly it generally (unless it's Hastings or something), because the perception of it isn't tourist friendly, and the rich people who live in those areas don't like it, and students won't fly it because they mostly think its racist
I mean I knew shows like Sherlock and Doctor Who were popular in other countries too but I didn’t know that translated to people acting British haha
I respect your view point but I'd happily fly both personally, because I understand all nations have their fair share of racists and far right nationalists who have adopted their nation's flag
Many in which are active in their Parliaments and receive a fair amount of votes
I agree about the Scottish/Welsh flag point, but I'm afraid far right nationalism normally occurs in countries with higher populations
There's far right nationalism and the sort of cultural pride nationalism in most higher populated countries -- imo, I believe the English flag should represent cultural pride, not far right nationalism because a few nationalist parties that are barely active anymore adopted the flag some decades ago
That's how I view the English flag; it shouldn't represent the bad side of nationalism
My original comment was directed towards somebody claiming football hooliganism and drunkness is specifically an English problem when it's experienced in the whole of the UK
[Joke answer]
[More serious answer] - Also, obligatory 'this was likely staged' comment
This one is also pretty up there
Well the empire doesnt exist anymore so its not really represented by anyone living - Also *if* it was represented by anyone that would be the head of the state who is the Queen
Yeah as below said, need around on average a 2-3%/pa pay rise for *wages to be static*
That's a lowering wage, and it's happen all over
It's horrendous :(
I clicked on that thinking 'im sure its bad but it wont be worse than here in London'. Nope, that were disgraceful
Fellow yorkie here, govt neglect of our region aside, QoL I daresay is abit better up here for younger people due to the cheaper rent and housing market
My cousins down south in Hampshire would be paying £600/m in rent for a one bedroom flat with no garden or driveway, but still have the same wages as us
Hate litter too, also a big problem in South Yorkshire too, worst thing for me is heading out to a national park and spotting someone's one-use bbq dumped behind a rock or something
Reallllly boils my blood people have such disrespect for the environment, but are happy to use it for their socialising, cunts
Not really
I grew up in a house that was regularly bombed (its even one of the top posts on /r/history which was weird for me to see)
Everywhere I go is shaped by the Blitz; I now am sat in my London flat which is a block that was built after German bombs desimated the residential streets around here
But whilst my grandparents and great grandparents all fought in various wars i didnt, so I dont have that personal connection to war at all
I live in SW England, and there are remains of bomb damage visible everywhere, it has just been cleaned up nicely
Rows of houses often have a break or random newbuild slotted in
A lot of damage was caused by the council after the war however, just google Plymouth City Centre
In the uk we have lots of them
Pint being world famous, now only really used as a bar measurement
But my favourite one being a land league, the distance the average man walks in an hour
And it's a clever estimation measurement because its subject to change due to terrain and other factors
Never really heard anyone use it but I'm doing my best to bring it back
Penises are measured in inches not centimetres here in the UK
So we haven't gone metric on that yet, the traditional unit of measurement is still widespread and the norm in that area
You mean the thickness of a squirrel hide surely
We use metric for basically everything else as well though, everything else that is weighed is in kg except people
Yeah KG is mostly used by younger generations in my experience, also by anyone who spends time lifting weights
Actually I think anyone who competes in amateur sports probably talks about their weight in KG
I did read it wrong but not in the way you think haha
I thought you had wrote
" we have open palms with are the same length as 40 squirrel hides"  and I was thinking your finish hands must be huge or you've got it mixed up haha
Creating a rule of 1 wonder per country (mostly for France)
Westminster Palace (stonehenge is boring)
mont
Michael (its really cool)
Brandenburg gate (Mount Zugspitze was good too tho)
Colloseum Of Rome (Ancient, fits the criteria well)
John's Co Cathedral (Sistine Chappel 2
La Sagrada Famillia (Big dick energy)
Grand Palace of Brussels (Buckingham Palace Xl++)
I haven't travelled to very many countries in Europe (and even then, I've not yet had the chances to explore those especially thoroughly), so these are suggestions drawn from my limited travels:
**Man-made**
* Stonehenge, Avebury & Associated Sites (already a WHS) + Old Sarum and Salisbury Cathedral
* Gardens of the Palace of Versailles
* Sagrada Familia
* London Underground
* Venice
* Vatican City
**Natural**
* Santorini
* Northumberland Coast
* Snowdonia National Park
* Lauterbrunnen Valley
* Sintra Mountains & coastline
You ever been through the Chunnel
It's a great feat of engineering but definitely not a wonder imo
I think the large hadron collider isn't a great one just because it's not necessarily a permanent feature
It will stop being useful to scientists in the future if either someone makes a bigger one or they've collected all the data they can from that one
It is quite the achievement, true
Agreed
That it’s culturally significant and in many ways fascinating doesn’t make it a wonder; it’s a place of unspeakable sadness and evil
Reminds me of the architecture you'd find in the North-east coast of America
>there will be severe repercussions (mainly tutting)
Don't forget the slightly too loud passive aggressive comment from an old lady at the back to whoever she's with
Absolutely this
Queing is one of the best parts of our culture
It only takes a trip south of Germany to realise why
I saw street organs and thought the Netherlands had an open black market for human organs
Oh dear
I've seen full Blown rows over queing, also abroad I've seen Brits kick off with locals about it
It's about the most insulting thing you can do to a Brit, push in his que
Yeah American streets are more orderly for sure
There's a little bit or chaos in the one you linked, which makes it seem human
You can tell it was made before the car
Just looking at those narrow streets makes me feel cosy
Would love to see Теремок, in Russia, come here
Love their minced beef blinis
Non England/uk dudes, there's this fast food restaurant here called Nando's, it's Portuguese style chicken and it's hella good
They seem to be slightly interested in international expansion
I saw one recently in London
I still use my Yahoo email as my main address so no
Well, they fucked it up by ruining the sweep fiction and having infinite scrolling
I'm English and signed up to GMX about 5 years ago as a spam account, it's much easier to open GMX accounts than it is to open a Gmail or a Hotmail or whatever, it's my go to for when I need fake emails (used it for work once too, they needed me to sign up for a competitors email list under a fake address)
Just to confirm, I understand that your question asks should the European Union ban them at a supranational level, please correct me if I'm wrong
If so, no, it should be left to the national governments to decide
EDIT: Removed Edit as put it on the wrong comment
Hey, I still want to enjoy playing fifa and battlefield
Because the outcome of the loot box is a random number generator, like spinning a roulette wheel, will you get a glorious new skin, or a shitty weapon like a rusted spoon
You pay in real money, say, $3 or what-have-you,  and could get something absolutely useless
Because of the randomised nature of it, it would make it a form of gambling, hence why it needs the regulation
EDIT: as to the no intrinsic value comment, some games have marketplaces  where the contents can be traded for cash, or in game currency, which  normally costs real world money, ergo, it does have value
One thing I feel fairly certain of is it will be a lot more racially and culturally diverse and hopefully that will be tolerated and embraced
As Irish as Father Ted is, it was produced by Channel 4 who are a British pubic service broadcaster
The show is never not on TV in the UK and memes are also prevalent here
Fuck, why the Germans always first, and they are not even funny
Mostly the 'i hear you're a racist now father' being used everytime a Tory politician acts like a Tory
I’d say we have the closest ties with the US
We always make fun of America and it’s politics and say how we’d hate to live in a country with Trump in power but I feel like we get on with Americans better than any other nation
I feel like Australia and Canada could be considered the closest too but I feel like our political relationship with the US boosts it to the top
Britain, her wife Scotland, her former lovers Ireland and France, and her many children
> we are a lonely distant island floating around aimlessly in the Atlantic Ocean
You could say the exact same about the entire planet Earth and Humanity as a whole as it and we are floating aimlessly in one of the more minor spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy
But regarding Iceland don't worry bro that won't last because in the coming 250 million years Iceland will no longer be a lonely distant island floating around aimlessly in the Atlantic Ocean
as Iceland and indeed all the world's nations will once again come together, reform and join up, smoosh together again as part of [one giant continuous supercontinent] as the Earth's continents continually drift closer and closer together
Then we'll all be a huge island floating in a massive Pacific Ocean(which at that point in time will cover over 50% of the entire Earth's surface)
But you won't be alone anymore
I'm English and lived in France and I completely agree
I felt very close culturally to French people in a lot of ways that I wouldn't with the rest of the UK
I think that's because I feel slightly guilty about the English relationship with other UK countries
I feel really embarrassed about English politics for example
Scotland, Ireland and Wales all have their just reasons for disliking England, as does France, but France were also dickheads to us which makes me feel okay about it
There’s a reason Scottish surnames are so common in Jamaica
As a fellow Brit, no
I hate that being born in England I inherited this shitty, antagonistic relationship with a bunch of other countries and half the country seems dead set on pissing off as many of our neighbours as possible
It’s fucking embarrassing
As a Londoner
lol
England's flag is quite meh however the British flag is so much better
[I’d change the English flag to the Three Lions]
I wouldn't. I quite like it tbh
. I also like that  is similar
I‘d change it to my county flag, so the whole country is now goose land
The flag of St David was the old Welsh flag
Simple design =/= meh
You can't remove the Nordic cross
Because swedes will be swedes forever
Love it but it's a bit complicated
The best flags are ones that children can draw with a few crayons
Yours is okay cause its the original
But all the variations are boring
We all know that would not work
all the norwegian soldiers would go to system bolaget
Anyway, our border is closed right now because Sweden is scary scary land
even the border between Norway and the UK opened up
Yeah, i know
You'd be expected to chip in to help with bills
It's not like real rent
I'd expect most parents charge at least half as much
And it's only if you have a full time job and are a bit older
I live with my parents and am still pursuing a degree
I pay them £100/month to contribute to food etc which isn't that much tbh
In the U.K. it’s not normally that they charge rent
Most parents don’t, to me it seems sort of selfish and cruel to make your child pay money to live with you
The ones that do will only ask for a small amount unless they are total dickheads
At least that’s how it is in my area
Really
Iv lives in Yorkshire all my life and only ever heard it called board
Iv live In Yorkshire and was super confused with people calling it rent
Only ever heard board
Yeah it was board in the east mids too
Yeah i worked in Hungary for about 3 months a few years ago and honestly didnt pick up a single word
I honestly couldnt even pick out individual words from what people were saying
I also think the wide variety of accents from all the English speaking countries doesn't help
That’s what I thought when I started learning spanish
I wasn’t sure if the teacher was speaking correctly or if she had a speech impediment
Until a mexican friend of mine said all spanish people speak like they have a ceceo and that it’s normal pronunciation
I've always said it sounds like you're on a gentle roller coaster going up and down all the time
And Tolkien he was most heavily influenced by Old English as well
Although that Anglo-Saxon influence was not so much in the languages of Middle Earth but more so in the entire world and story of Middle Earth etc which itself is very heavily inspired by and based on Anglo-Saxon tales
He was a linguistics professor specialising in Anglo-Saxon England/Old English after all iirc
English is a real mashup of a language, but I was taught the basic of it was West Germanic, from those pesky Angles, Saxons and Jutes, as in people from Jutland
The thing that always surprises me is how little Gaelic there is in it
English directly descends from proto-germanic, just like any other germanic language
I wanna thank the Dutch for stroopwafels
They have revolutionised my cups of tea and coffees
They're up there with the chocolate digestive
Thank you France, Italy and Spain for all the great wine
I'm surprised noones said this, BUT THANKS YOU SWITZERLAND FOR THE ABSOLUTE BEAUTY THAT IS TOBLERONE
I'd like to thank my own nation
For all of its wrongdoings and fucky wuckys it did
It fathered so many great nation's, it bailed Europe out during the first world war, held stoicly in ww2, endured months of air raids and didn't break, it was the first major power in the west to abolish slavery, it defeated Napoleon and his regime, gave birth to the 3rd most spoken language on the planet, founded Canada, Australia and to some degree the us, so whatever your opinion of us, and no matter our wrongs,
Rule Brittania
And likewise here
Polish pilots defended our skies during the Battle of Britain, even after we hadn't lifted a finger to defend theirs
Polish soldiers parachuted into Arnhem to support our paras, even though they were supposed to be waiting to drop into Warsaw and even though the operation had already gone to shit
Polish sailors left their bases even before the shooting started to get to Britain and join in the combined war effort
For two years between the fall of France and the arrival of the Americans, Poland was our most steadfast and numerous ally outside the Empire
We may not have been able to stop Stalin taking the country in 1945 without starting WW3, but we didn't have to make them the only country in the world not to march in the big victory parade in London
We didn't have to forcibly repatriate the guys who wanted to stay here, knowing they'd be imprisoned as capitalist spies *at best*.
So yes, thank you Poland, and sorry
Thanks Finland for my favourite F1 driver Mika Häkkinen
Seconded
A genuine moment in history
Thank you for Hollywood
Dude come on, thanking ourselves
I didn't even know they existed, but I'll look for them
Thanks fren
- forever allies
You'd think 303 was the only Polish squadron in the Battle of Britain, but 302 were involved too, as part of Leigh-Mallory's Big Wing, while 300 and 301 were flying night sorties in *Fairey Bartles* bombing the invasion ports (which most people didn't even know happened at all
The definition of "socialism" in American politics seems to be social democracy, or really anything left of (and sometimes including) Obama
I facepalmed
Who else are we gonna thank
A frenchman praising our food
the apocalypse draws near
Doesnt Putin have a ridiculously high approval rating though
Isnt it fair to say the large majority of Russians agree with what he does and says
I suggest you actually read through this thread, mate
Yes, the Sabaton song does indeed, but just in general 303 get all the attention - understandably, they were right in the thick of it and became stars at the time too - at the expense of the other guys
But Russia are doing these things *now*
As a Brit, can I just point out here, the Dutch word for money is munnie
that is absolutely brilliant :)

That hurt :(
Loughborough :(
Luxembourg
Is not just a tax haven or something
Or is that Liechtenstein
I guess they probably have a couple of good looking towns or something, probably very peaceful
I imagine if I was driving near one of them I would likely take a detour out of curiosity but should I actually have some desire to visit
Albania is interesting for all the wrong reasons
Copenhagen is worth a city break
Understand where you come from but I think the highlands in scotland are interesting and worth seeing
> I also am a history nerd but I can not interest myself in English/British history
Bit weird IMO - We've managed to involve ourselves in the histories of most countries
I sort find it hard to make the argument of 'look our history is interesting' because there is so god damn much of it and its so world famous that i'd feel like an Italian trying to explain why their food is renowned, it just is
Are you also no interested in historic artifacts
Architecture
Art
Museums
Galleries
- Because if you genuinely have any interest in history then why wouldnt you want to visit some of the best museums in the word, for free
We def do give off a depressive vibe, its our forte but behind it is a sense of humour that makes us alright IMO
I won't argue against the depressive vibe because we are specialists in it and I know what you mean
But the history one I find a bit baffling
There's no way of saying it without coming off big-headed but modern world history kinda is British history
We're pretty much involved in everything that happened throughout the last 300 years
Does it not interest you how a little European island backwater came to be the sole world superpower that formed the biggest empire the world has ever seen and laid the groundworks for the modern world
Unless you just prefer ancient or medieval history
> but mountains without the sea is like having a soup without a dessert
Is this a phrase that doesnt translate into English or something
I am so confused
It sounds like you don't like the stereotypical middle-class "twee" British culture that a lot of foreigners latch onto
It is often a caricature and to be honest growing up as a working class person I struggle to relate to a lot of it
Tea is delicious though
I'm pretty sure every big western city in europe is a melting pot with such diverse cultures
What I once found really eye opening was seeing comments mostly from French people but a few other nationalities when the Tour de France once started in England they had *no* idea that Englands national parks look [like this]
> Colonial history of the Spaniards, Portugese and Dutch I find more interesting and the medievel history of England/Britain
It may shock you to learn this but the UK has a fair amount of colonial history
Vikings got away with all their shenanigans too
Boring ass Vikings
> Otherwise it's not particularly interesting to read about for instance how many Indians the British killed or how much they fucked other countries over, and completely got away with as far as everyone is concerned
Pretty depressing actually
How is this not interesting
You have India, an entire subcontinent filled with numerous languages, cultures and religions
One of the oldest civilisations in the world and one of the richest places in the world at the time
The entire subcontinent came under control of a small Island in the North Atlantic that previously was a relative backwater
What is more interesting, it didn't even come under control by military conquest at first
The spice trade brought young men over who wanted to get rich
One successful trip there and back, if you survived the tropical diseases that killed in their hundreds, would make you never have to work again
Black pepper was so valuable that people would leave Britain as nobodies and come back to buy themselves huge estates and basically buy themselves into nobility
There was so much money to be made that a private company, The British East India Company, literally came to rule over the Kingdom of Bengal
Imagine Amazon owning Germany to put that into perspective
It was only later that the government took over and slowly Indian kingdoms came under British rule
You can call it brutal and you'd be right, but that is the entirety of human history and I don't see how it makes it less interesting
> Maybe for a super small period
Is [100] years a small period
Compared to the Romans of course, but in modern times That's longer than the US has dominated
&#x200B;
>Yeah, because of Canada and Australia
>When I want to intrest myself in massive empires their are more intresting ones
England was lucky it was on an island, had just more population than the Netherlands and Portugal and it profited of Napoleons occupation of Holland
Only the conquest of India and the conflicts in Europe I find mildly intresting about english/british history
You can downplay it by saying Canada and Australia were big and empty, but even managing to own such big places uncontested points to our dominance at the time
Of course being an island helps, but being the birthplace of the industrial revolution was also a factor
London really is a different level to say Madrid or Berlin
Only Paris is comparable
It's a world city on the level of New York
I actually find woods an odd one as we dont have many woods
Most of our forests have been cut down to make way for those rolling hills of farmland
I would have thought the more common images would be seaside towns and the white cliffs of Dover
Than the largest, longest running, most powerful, still in affect to this day, made the capital city the center of the world, the reason we are talking in English right now, the reason English is spoken everywhere, the reason that English formal dress is the worlds formal dress, that colony
The single thing that has affected all of modern politics
The colony that is responsible for endless atrocities and periods of relative world peace, Uninteresting
Without the Spanish, Portuguese or Dutch colonies some parts of the world would be different today
Without the British Empire *all* of the world would be different today
I'm not saying it makes us interesting, I'm saying it makes British history interesting
The British Raj is British history as well as Indian history
Cool so the world speaks Dutch and wears Clogs
The Dutch were an origional super power
Amsterdam was a world capital
Radios play Dutch music and parliaments around the world are based upon the Dutch governmental system
The basis for the rule of law in many countries is based upon what the laws were in Holland
- Or is none of that true
The Dutch empire was a huge trading organization, was immensely wealthy but only ever *controlled* small areas
Its power was financial, pretty boring IMO
Its like comparing a cheque book with a WMD
To me it looks like you're reaching for reasons to find British history uninteresting because much of it is brutal
Like WW2 is super interesting, its the go-to subject for many an amateur historian, we dont claim it as uninteresting because millions of innocent people were brutally murdered
If you're upset that British people dont currently live in poverty because other British people born a few hundred years ago did terrible things then I hate to be the one to inform you that the world doesnt work like that and such views are ridiculous
> But this isn't what my argument was so this conversation is pointless
I just said your statement wasn't correct and you haven't given an argument to take that back
I have clearly given an answer to take that back
Look, here is a better answer; What language are we speaking right now
If you were in China and didnt know Mandarin what is the first language you would try and communicate in
What about India if you didnt know Hindi or Urdu
Or if you were in the middle east and didnt know any Arabic
Or in Africa and didnt know any of the many African languages, maybe French but if that didnt work
Would the answer ever be Dutch
If Holland was this amazingly powerful why does no one outside of Holland and some parts of Belgium speak Dutch
Is Dutch even taught as a foreign language anywhere
Speak to any random person in a former Dutch colony and show them a picture of Rutte or Willem-Alexander and a picture of the Queen, who do you think they would be more likely to recognize
The Dutch empire pales in comparison to the British Empire not just because of lack of industrial, financial, physical, or threat, just look at the ever lasting soft power the British Empire has installed
Still to this day a European country run by morons is seen as more than it is only because more than a century since it fell it still lays in the shadow of former glory
> WW2 is not simply British history, though
I also fail to see what makes British participation in WW2 interesting
You're missing a clear case of me making an example
> Otherwise it's not particularly interesting to read about for instance how many Indians the British killed or how much they fucked other countries over, **and completely got away with as far as everyone is concerned**. Pretty depressing actually
I'm not upset about anything
Are you sure
It can mean that in English too
It can mean that in English too

“It’s a long way to Tipperary” For some reason this song always resonated with me as representing the British spirit

Also Holst wrote some beautiful music
Because it's overdone so the shop assistants find it annoying
Midlander living in London for 7ish years now
Assuming we’re disregarding the current situation, I love London
It’s a vibrant, bustling city overflowing with things to see and do
There’s fantastic architecture, food, art, museums, parks etc, the people are nowhere near as unfriendly as non-Londoners like to think they are, and getting around is (generally) very easy and straightforward
Is it expensive
Yes
It is worth it for me personally
1,000,000%. I can’t see myself living anywhere else on Earth
I live in London
I mean this is such a broad question, life for me is totally different than life for someone growing up on a council estate and equally different to someone growing up in a Kensington town house
I suppose I can only really answer what its like for me (middle class 30 year old)
Theres a great food and places to drink in London, also some of the worlds best galleries and museums, as someone who likes art and food this is amazing
I have a decent job and disposable income so I can often explore and appreciate what the city has to offer
London is very much a 'global city', this means about 50% of the population were born overseas, often this is a good thing as it makes the city interesting but I'm not gonna lie, some people do a much better job at following the law and making the city a better place than others
Theres a big Turkish community where I live and just about every young Turkish man drives like an absolute idiot, also the attacks on members of the LGBT community are not okay - I dont know why anyone would move to very liberal place like London and then be mad that there are gay people here
Like just about all Millennial Londoners am I sick to stomach about the price of property here, its just outrageous what has happened to house prices in the capital and its the single worst thing about the city which has many other problems like overcrowding, litter, crime, homelessness, drug abuse, traffic, pollution
All those negatives being said its still a great city, some parts are stunning, the architecture and the parks are amazing for such a big place
Most major city's have 1 or 2 nice parks whilst London has parks for absolute days
Plenty of Turkish people are also nice with good restaurants and great local Bakeries
being "sent to Coventry" makes a bit more sense then
Midlands erasure again

The classic one in the UK is whether or not someone says the word ‘scone’ to rhyme with the word ‘cone’ or the word ‘con’.
I say scone to rhyme with ‘cone’ because I’m not a disgusting subhuman
Is it scone or scone
Do you put the jam first them clotted cream or the other way round
People who take the tea bag out before putting milk in
And barbarians who leave the tea bag in and put milk in
I'm sorry but when you put the milk in absolutely matters and effects the taste, and of course it goes in second
Have been having a blazing argument with a colleague for a few years now about the cream/jam scones beef
They did, in 1991
Cakes and biscuits are taxed at different rates, so there was a tribunal between McVities and HM Revenue & Customs
> with the court finding in McVitie's favour that the Jaffa cake should be considered a cake for tax purposes
(for some reason a chocolate biscuit is deemed a luxury good and subject to VAT but a cake isn't.)
Cakes and biscuits are taxed at the same rate
Chocolate-covered biscuits are taxed at a higher rate iirc
I guess people like to argue about exactly because it doesn't matter, it's safe
You can have a passionate, heated argument about milk and know that when it's finished nobody will really care, but other subjects, especially politics, can be hard to come back from
That's it, I remember now
For some reason, chocolate biscuits are a "luxury" but cakes with chocolate on aren't.
IMO Austria is a small/medium sized country in terms of population and land area but, I dunno, it somehow escapes having a small country vibe and its just a bit of an unknown country - I say this as someone who goes to Austria every year as my Girlfriends family has a place there but still feel like Austria is just this total mystery
I have met far more Germans in Austria than I have actual Austrians
I think that’s more of a Scottish thing than a small country thing
Mostly on ski slopes

I'm in engineering and the only way we can get extra money out of a client if it's *their* fault e.g. if they add an extra requirement that wasn't included in their original tender, or change the material or design etc
Any other unforseen costs (like requiring more man hours than we estimated for, or material costing more than we estimated) are our problem and we have to absorb them
We stockpiling because of Brexit
Yes, went to the ATM at a Petrol Station today in rural Lincolnshire
A woman leaving the shop said to her friend "you can't even eat toilet roll". I've never seen it so busy
Ive never seen that much meat in my life before, holy crap
:O.. Im like where the fuck would that guy even store all that meat
, No home freezer can store that much(or in Poland do you have gigantic freezers
, im guessing not), maybe he must have some walk-in style huge industrial unit somewhere though
But still buying that much meat is crazy
It goes beyond common sense at that point, the expense alone must be insane
the hand gel makes sense
Lots of people have been buying it who wouldn’t normally and it does make sense to have some
Iv not seen anything missing from the shelves in England except hand gel
Its so stupid because we're nowhere near at that stage yet where you need to stock up
They haven't said anything about areas being quarantined
Even if they do you don't need 10 packs of toilet paper

Everything I've read says it's mostly affecting the lungs
Also London and my nearest big Tesco had ran out of all pasta, rice, loo roll
Tinned sardines were almost all gone too
Everyone should have a stockpile before these events occur
I tend to over buy soap, but I have sensitive skin and a lot of the main brands make my skin crack and bleed
Not using them
What are you doing to need so many
Makes more sense to use them now
I like Russians dasvidaniya
its beautiful sounding to me
“Saudades” is a singular term for missing someone in Portuguese
In mandarin, the milky way is Ying He, or Silver River
Interesting
Thank you
So its a compound word
Anything with a hyphen: Lucie-Mae, Kira-Lee, John-Paul etc etc
Normal names spelt incorrectly: Jayme, Traci, Kaylee
Stripper names: Mercedes, Crystal, Lacey
There's some boys names that have connotations with being a Chav: Dean, Jordan (there are more but I can't think of them right now)
It’s a bit of a shame
I really like the latinised variant ‘Adolphus’. Not really an option anymore
Its kind of trashy here too
I was going to say
Kevin and Jason
Exotic
I mean at lease Jacqueline is longer and sounds a _bit_ more impressive
The seed drill and steam engine
Fuelled both the agricultural and industrial revolutions
I mean, England invented football, which is literally the world’s most popular sport
I’m pretty proud of that
Because you invented the metric system, we made it our greatest effort not to use it (and in some cases still not use it) for as long as possible :/
One of my favourite random facts is that Chupa Chups logo was designed by Salvador Dali
I'd heard it was an English man who invented the steam engine and James watt developed it further - fuelling the industrial revolution
So you sort of invented the industrial revolution I guess
Fair to attribute the inventions of the industrial revolution as British I think
Heading d’ya mean
The uk plug is objectively safer though
I always think it sounds like a weird thing that a bad author would include in a story to make the plot work better
Like the main character speaks English and everyone else in the world *just so happens* to learn English as well
Seems kind of fake to me idk
The positive is obviously that it makes life easier a lot of the time
Most popular films are in my native language, I can communicate easily with people from other countries (depending on the country), my language will always be catered for etc
A negative side which no one talks about is the scenario where you go abroad and want to go on a tour with a tour guide
Many of them will have an English tour guide, a French one etc
I feel like if you speak French, the tour guide is fairly likely to be a native speaker or at least more likely
Whereas because everyone learns English, the English tour guide probably won't be a native speaker
I guess it's worse if you speak a language like Finnish because there may not be a tour guide at all in your language but that's besides the point
Also, in museums and shit where there's some audio guide I often find the English recording speaks really slowly
Makes sense because many people will use the English one because the museum doesn't offer their native language but it's still annoying
Well, it's always been like that, so I don't find it weird
On the plus side, it's more convenient for travel
But I think it makes it harder for us to learn foreign languages
Our education systems doesn't put enough emphasis on it, and when travelling I feel embarrassed attempting other languages, because other people can speak mine so well
I suppose it is a little bit weird when you stop and think about it
In my day to day life though it doesn't cross my mind much
Whether or not English is the international language, I would still be carrying out my life here in English
I wouldn't particularly say it's a negative, after all it makes things easier for me if lots of people speak my language haha
A bit, I'm learning French at school, and it feels a bit pointless because as soon as we go to France everyone speaks English to us
No why would it be weird or negative
I suppose the only negative is English first language speakers e world over are shite at other languages
The Irish barely even k or their own language, the English are pitiful and so are Ozzys and yanks
Why would they bother
You call it lazyness but it’s clear the world over if your first language is English it’s u likely you will be fluent in another language
You can hardly call it lazyness
It’s just about winning the language lottery
I remember being on a school trip to Caen for GCSE french and evening tho we were staying somewhere made to teach English kids if they asked us a question and we didn’t understand they’d switch straight to English without talking slower or maybe using more simple language
It was quite frustrating
I'm northern so part of the problem I have with non-native tour guides is that they don't always understand my accent
So maybe that would be a positive thing lol
You only think it's easy because of how pervasive it is
In another dimension it's hardly spoken outside of England and it's a difficult little germanic language with strangers vowels and consonants and inconsistent orthography, somewhat like Danish
I don’t think you fully understand me
ALL The countries with English as a first language are terrible at foreign languages and quite clearly do well in other subjects so it’s not as simple as calling them lazy
Clearly there is another causation at work
Ozzie’s tried to hard to be british empire 2
0 so Canada had to be the favourite
It really is, wasn’t expecting it from people trained to teach Brits french but happened anyway
You started it
I still don’t think you properly understand what I’m saying
If you seee born with English as a first language you would very likely also only speak one language
But you wouldn’t though
That’s what you aren’t understanding
You wouldn’t be the same person if you were born with English as a first language
It’s like saying “I wouldn’t have fought in the nazi army, I would have spoke out against hitler in 1939
” Yeah I believe you
You don’t get it
Have a good day pal
I _still_ play the shit out Roller Coaster Tycoon
Did you know there’s a mobile version of the game called Roller Coaster Tycoon Classic
It’s the first two games in one and it’s incredible
Best video game mobile port I’ve ever played
Full of dozens and dozens of scenarios and works so well
I was genuinely taken aback by good it is
There was a hamster who got given a Viking funeral and they put him on a little boat and burned it down the river
Isn't that
disgusting
We are so hated
Same to me but Birmingham
I swear pretty much every working class English lad has at least one Irish grandparent
The people leaving nasty comments about us on here are a vocal minority, they hardly exist outside of the reddit bubble
Any time
Not really the point
Sounds like something you just read on reddit
I know Barr drinks are popular over here
They make flavours such as lime, cola, lemonade, cherryade, cream soda etc
They also make Irn Bru which is popular in Scotland, KA drinks that have flavours like black grape, pineapple, fruit punch etc
Other stuff includes the Simply Fruity, their equivalent of the Robinson’s Fruit Shoot which is popular with kids over here and Tizer
Probably shouldn’t speak for the country but I haven’t seen any Maltese in this thread
Kinnie seems to be popular over there, when I went there in December all the tourist boards were reminding us to pick up this drink before we left
Quite a unique taste, I preferred it when we got it in a pub because it came with a slice of orange that I think went well with it
When I went to Iceland I got a drink called Appelsin
I'm not sure if it's available anywhere else but I'm confident this drink is what the ancient Greeks were talking about when they referred to Ambrosia/Nectar of the gods
It’s kind of dead now but we used to have Tizer
I guess some people here drink the Levi Roots (Reggae Reggae guy) drinks
Lucozade is the best but you can get vimto and ribena in a can that are fizzy
I love mezomix
I like those Irn Bru fizzy chewey bar things
Do you think its because of how he perceived next to Franco (and to a lesser degree: Hitler and Mussolini)
Obviously there was censorship and a lot of other downsides to Salazar’s regime - but it never engaged in a White Terror as occurred right over the border in Spain
Is it a factor of: “Things weren’t great but they weren’t as bad as *gestures vaguely at spain* that”?
Glad you like English ^__^
Yessss I love Turkish tea
Rural people from the UK tend to be a lot wealthier than rural people from others countrys, probably because the UK is much smaller and you aren't as isolated from services and jobs if you live rurally
I'd say it's more that rural people look at people living in urban areas as being poor and stupid
Houses in the countryside are usually pretty expensive to be honest
They are normally old people though getting a retirement house
A lot of rural people are racists as barely any non whites if any live there, and the communities are small, some of them don’t even have internet, easy access to the rest of the country etc
Although nowadays probably avkut 90% of the population live in an urban environment
In england they are either seen as posh toff twats with too much money who are I to hunting and shooting g or poor uneducated country bumpkins who spend took much time abusing animals
I'm an english lad but spent most summers on my uncles farm in county galway and the dubliners got more stick than I did hahah
Theres a lot of working class that also live in the countryside
In some places they actually have really good community cohesion with the toffs
You would be surprised
Me too bro but I revel in it
Townies dont understand the country
Probably the July 2005 London Tube Attacks (7/7 Bombings)
If not that then the 1984 Brighton Hotel Bombing where the IRA tried to assassinate the UK Cabinet, including PM Margaret Thatcher
If we're talking accidents then the Flixborough disaster in 1974 when a chemical plant blew up
There was a larger one but I hadn't heard of it until just now when I was looking up the dates of these other ones
In 1944 an RAF (Royal Air Force) munitions depot exploded at RAF Fauld
[It was the largest to ever occur on UK soil
Not sure exactly, maybe 7/7, the Manchester Ariana grande bombing, the ira, there’s been a few
I’d say in modern times the most talked about is Ariana grande, but overall probably the ira because of how much death there was for all that time
who doesn't tbf
stupid, sexy Deutschland
Was that 'nice'?
I've always thought of the Irish as being more passionate, easy going and funnier than us
got a lot of love and time for the Irish
every single Irishman I've met has been good fun to be around
can't wait until i can pop over for another visit
Englishman with an Irish boyfriend here
He’s way hotter than me
I guess you guys have to do something to entertain yourselves when everyone else is competing
it's this attitude that makes Germans so respected
especially in comparison to my country where the darker parts of our history is either ignored or (more disturbingly) actively celebrated
I love milk
Especially the unhomogenised stuff
I used to drink a lot of milk but have since gone Vegan so I don't drink it all now haha
I have Soy Milk in coffee and with cereal but the consistency of it is a bit too thick for me to just enjoy a cold glass of it
I prefer water these days
I was looking for this
Very horrorshow indeed
I agree when I went to Poland I noticed the milk tasted especially good too
Huh I do too
In english we have "the arse end of nowhere
A rabbit snd and hare are not the same animal
France gets credit for their amount of cheese but England has so many more variaties
It's not really something we think or talk about tbh
By plans for switching I assume you mean the government changing road signs to metric, for example
IMO it would be a huge waste of money for no gain, and would just confuse everyone
The culture, sure
But we have pretty much the same claim ancestry-wise
Most English people have very high proportions of Celtic DNA
“UK and Europe”
Gym weights are pretty easy to convert and most people learn both especially if exposed to American YouTube and such
Looks like a stool sample i had to give a few months ago
London has quite a skyline now, but it’s because we don’t want the view of historical buildings to be clustered with skyscrapers
We started building (small) skyscrapers in my hometown and it just looks like shit
It makes sense in somewhere like London
Not a suburban Surrey town
Depends on the terms/phrases
For instance, it makes sense for an American/Canadian living in the UK to say ‘pavement’ rather than ‘sidewalk’ etc
Probably just easier for most people to comprehend
But hearing them say things like ‘wanker’ or ‘bloody’ just don’t sound right in a North American accent
On a slightly related topic, if I, a Brit, where to go on holiday to Austria and speak German German, for it is the only German I know, would it be insulting
We call them bum bags :)
Why the rest of the UK seem to hate us but we like them
Kind of like how England thinks there's a rivalry between us and Germany but in reality Germans don't really care about us
(As far as I know)
Lol pretending the Welsh dont do this to some ridiculous degree during the rugby
Booing whenever an english coach or player is on the big screen, booing kicks etc etc
And its not exactly arrogance when we shit on our teams more than anyone elses
I was in Cardiff during the last football world cup and would see huge numbers of Welsh guys purchaing the shirts of anyone England was playing
You're more likely going to find English people supporting Wales in the football than you would supporting anyone Wales was playing against
You’re kidding me right
Wales were talking _mad shit_ at the last Euros
Why do you always act like we’re the only ones do that
Not to mention ABE
and _we’re_ the arrogant ones
So ridiculously un self-aware
Honestly mate you've hit the nail on the head and put it how I couldn't. It's almost like if everyone thinks we're cunts, then we might as well give them what they want and be as obnoxious as possible
It's a big country little country thing
I see it with Austrians and Germans
Smaller counties are allowed to be nationalistic and mock the bigger country, but it's not seen as arrogant because they're the smaller country
In a way that is an arrogance
It's not exactly unique to us
Everyone else on earth does it too
Because we have massive expectations as a country
We have the best league in the world, produce world class players and even invented the game yet our international record is underwhelming
Its frustrating
We say that all the time because we invented football and it’s a funny song
We don’t actually believe that we’re going to win literally every competition (we’d have to win at least one first)
Literally nothing wrong with this
It's been our football song for 24 years
Yeah most of it is probably due to media
Wish it wasn't that way though I like how we're all unified
There are definitely a vocal minority of people I've come across who have been pretty toxic because I'm English
But everytime I've been to Wales they're a lot friendlier than anywhere I've been in England
Never been to Scotland but presumably it's the same
That just proves my point
Presumably it started from both the wars but in football seems like we always lose to Germany in important matches and vice versa
I think most English people see it as a friendly rivalry though nothing too serious
It's both though
The song is ironic and even has us losing at the end
It's about disappointment
But when we got to the semis of course we believed
Yeah and everyone is always so nice and cordial towards England
Because it’s specifically directed at us
Like, explicitly
Maybe that’s why
I agree with everything you said
Each cuisine has its own "grammar" and its wrong to judge one cuisine by the grammar of the other
With regards to Indian food, he can't taste the spices because his palate hasn't been trained to
Indians have grown up eating all those spice combinations so they genuinely can identify all the different spices in a masala
They might think Italian food is bland, but they would be wrong to think that because they'd be judging Italian food by Indian standards, just as its wrong to judge in the other direction
Its a sad mindset to have because you're limiting yourself to so many cuisines that are all right in their own way
Lol like I give a fuck after a comment like that
Xenophobic turd
Very typical
I’m not beholden to your moving standards
You call us arrogant knowing full well that unless we all just roll over and agree with you you’re going to claim that as proof
Disingenuous nonsense
How do you think people should respond to bullshit unjustified xenophobic twattery
Tit
I’m starting to think you don’t know what the word arrogance means
It’s not arrogant to have a negative reaction to some spreading bigoted lies
I’m pretty sure hoover was a brand, everyone calls vacuum cleaners hoovers
Also sellotape
I had no idea it was a brand
I find it funny that you used the word ‘sharpie’ to describe a highlighter
Another example of brand dominance in English lol
Fanta is an orange flavoured soda in many other places, what flavour is it in Turkey
Or, you know
just short for 'refrigerator'.
I see, thanks for the reply
I was at a zoo looking at the gorilla's and a little boy asked his father what they were and the father said "I dunno, I think they're some sort of monkey
Not about someone else but once I went to Canada and i was in the cnn tower
there was a sign which said we were 561ft/pi above the ground so I shouted we’re 561 feet or pints above the ground
I got a lot of stares
Not going to even pretend to not know where those lads came from
TBF though, living in London you see people from all over Europe acting the same way here, doing coke openly in pubs etc
Maybe I'm just a scaredy cat, but I see way too many tourists being dumb on dangerous ledges
The worst was in Budapest, where I saw a family posing for a picture on one of the bridges, and they had a toddler stood up on top of the wall
It's one thing for an adult to do something like that, but a toddler doesn't understand the potential dangers of doing something like that
I did that accidently a few times there
The bike lanes are pretty empty here, so I'm not used to watching out for bikes
There's also the usual European hazard of the all the traffic going the other way as well
So I was either forgetting to look for bikes or looking the wrong way for them
When I was in Copenhagen I tried to be cognisant of the bike lanes
but I'm from a country that has barely any and was in a city that's full of them
Think I may have gotten in someone's way a couple of times
I definitely did this in Valencia’s parks a couple of times
Not used to them in the U.K. but after the first couple of errors I was fine
But surely by her own logic her ability to speak French would mean that she could also understand Spanish
The top of a mountain is one of the places that I would least likely to be pissed at
They have a good point to be fair
It was Howletts Zoo, in Kent somewhere
Shamefully, this was an English person
As with others, it looks like, you sometimes hear "the provinces" - I've encountered it particularly in theatre, where if it's not in London it's "provincial theatre" and looked down on
"The Shires" is sometimes seen too, usually indicating a rather twee, cutesy countryside image: the Cotswolds is "the shires", Barnsley is not
Derogatory sense, ‘cunch’ meaning countryside, young people in London say this as an insult when someone uses slang wrong or just pretends like their a gangster when there not, a lot of people above 25 wouldn’t have heard it before
It originated when gangs from London started ‘county lines’ which is sending teenagers from their hoods ‘ot’ (out of town) or ‘to cunch’ basically mainly counties around south east London to sell drugs for more money and with less risk of police and rival gangs, for more money
But yh nowasays it is mainly used by people from London who want to feel like their better than everyone else because they are in the capital
Wow we use hinterland in English too to mean sort of very remote wilderness
Wow that’s actually quite mean
You learn something knew every day
Barnsley is actually pretty beautiful in some parts
I took the dogs to Wentworth castle at the weekend
Beautiful
Being called the north is a privilege and not derogatory,the cheek of these fucking southern fairies
"London bubble" springs to mind
Can you give an example of where this is used
I’ve never heard this before in my life
Oh, don't mean to dunk on Barnsley - if it's in Yorkshire it's all reet in my book
Just doesn't fit the image of "The Shires".
What do you mean by Greek everywhere
I've only seen one so far from my experience
I didn't know there were so many nationalities in London
I think British people generally dress quite revealing in terms of their clothing on night outs
Even in the winter or when its snowing
I don't know why this is, but I have heard somewhere many years ago on an article that this came round because Britain is a less Conservative country socially compared to the rest of Europe
Dressing oddly is probably far more accepted in Britain (and Ireland) too
Probably because the UK has school uniforms in high school, do bear that in mind
Thats true - but equally if you are flying from the UK to Southern Europe, or at least Spain, Italy & Portugal; half the time the border guards don’t bother looking anyway as long as you are physically holding a passport as you walk by
I say this as a white man, i hope its no different for people of colour but i would not be surprised if it was
Go to Gibraltar man - it’s basically the lingua franca
Is it a myth that French motor insurance specifically excludes the Etoile unless you pay extra
Aubergine is my favourite
We even say it with french pronunciation
I read somewhere that English doesn't so much borrow words from other languages as chase them down dark alleys, beat them up and rob them of anything of value
I’ll do this three ways: recognised regional minority languages in England, recognised regional minority languages in the UK and languages in general that aren’t recognised (ie languages brought over from immigrants or languages as part of a religion etc)
In England, I’d say Cornish
The UK I’d say Welsh
Excluding recognised languages, I think I read somewhere that Polish is the second largest language spoken in the UK
Tbh as someone who's 18 I don't really understand how someone similar age to me could be so incompetent with computers as people on this thread are describing
People forget that I didn't have a smartphone until I was around 13 and even then I barely used it
I spent most of my childhood using computers rather than tablets
I just wonder if it's circumstantial
Maybe some kids got smartphones earlier and didn't have a computer at home before that
Maybe some didn't have good IT education at school or didn't listen
How
Did you never have to use PowerPoint for school
I feel like most of what I learnt about computers in terms of basic functioning was due to having to use programs like PowerPoint and word for school projects
We were also taught how to use them at school
I also took computer science at school where I learnt more but not really more about using a computer, mainly about how a computer works and computer specs and what they mean
I suppose it depends on the education system and the school you went to
But for me it seems hard to understand how someone wouldn't have ever had to use PowerPoint or word for school projects
And when I used them at those times, I found out about new features just by exploring, the layout is pretty intuitive
Very very common
I have a fairly diverse group of friends and family, and most smoke or have smoked
I’ve encountered smokers who were middle class parents/grandparents and “well respected in the community” types (a mayor for instance), at parties/gatherings used like alcohol, 20-somethings of most backgrounds, people who are married to police, the list goes on
And for diverse reasons too: physical illness, chronic pain, mental health, to unwind daily, just saved for special occasions, when doing a specific activity (art, movies, hiking)
or just to chill and be lazy
In general it is just very common and not for any one reason, and seems to be popular in most demographics for one reason or another
Anywhere between like 10-25, has probably had it in the past year
I know it’s young to have it, but probably like 80% of people would’ve had it at least once in their lives country wide
I’m one of the only ones my age (14/15) who hasn’t had it, and some people have it daily
A lot of older people think weed is awful whilst they snort a line every week, or inject heroin into their arms
Huh, I never really thought of French Polynesia as a hub for weed
>50-70 : „wheeha, finally my nephew brings in the good stuff, light it up like it’s 1969“
Does that attitude still hold in Eastern Germany
Ahhh yes we do that too
I have an Anglo surname and its spelled like 5 different ways
If you ever have any doubt about the quality of English on the sub, pop over to r/ukpolitics and see what horrors native English speakers can inflict
Standards here are high, it amuses me no end when a poster writes not just grammatically correct English, but good prose style and ends with 'please excuse my English'.
It's really good
The majority of the time I wouldn't be able to tell they're non-native
Occasionally there are mistakes of course but on the whole it's pretty flawless
Mostly great but sometimes a little off and I never know if its rude or helpful to correct someone
The level of English here is very good indeed
Embarrassingly so
Rarely do I see mistakes
I don’t think I could identify any frequently-made mistakes
I’ve noticed not just here but across Reddit, people constantly write ‘went’ instead of ‘gone’.
I.e. I should have went that way
I love how Portuguese people say codfish
To any non-native English speakers reading
Does English sound like a Germanic language to your ears
, And do you hear any similarities between English and other Germanic languages
, Also as a non-native speaker what did the English language(and the English accent) sound like to you before you learned English
I can't see any comment here referencing /UKPol
Seems like you've inserted that one all on your own OP
Seems like you had a conclusion already
Why would we write like we were writing English language essays on a native English sub
Just nonsense
People typing on their phones type quickly, people showing off their English skill want to be meticulous
It's*
How did you manage to support yourself during the degree if the UK govt doesn't provide assistance
That scarpered my plans of study in Sweden in 2017 when I realise student finance England doesn't lift a finger for its students abroad
My brother in Sweden only managed to do it because he got his citizenship first
I've grasped Swedish fairly easily when I put a few months into learning it, is the transition from Swedish to Norwegian particularly difficult for a native English speaker
In uni in England atm, but one of my plans is to move over to either of the nordic countries once I've got a bit of post grad experience
Good on you mate
My ex was also Finnish, stupidly we ended up I England for a year before we split (met down under), but she was adamant she didn't wanna do Finland
Shame, I could be nearly 4 years in towards attaining citizenship at this point
Yeah
My options have been utterly obliterated thanks to brexit, so it's a must i take on the traditional UK student loans to get where I wanna be now, such is reality
Edit: I might add I'm studying for my bachelors in software engineering, so I'll be in a great position to relocate after my first grad job, I'm confident :)
Yeah that's my assumption too, one of my Norwegian mates I travelled with I found hard to grasp most things he said when speaking Norwegian, Swedish however I find much easier
Is that a Finnish compulsory requirement for EU citizens is it
Aye Swedish is only really used on the west coast from what I believe
> (normaltrack/broadtrack/metertrack/narrowtrack)
We use Standard gauge, broad gauge, metre gauge, narrow gauge
Broad-gauge track was only used in Britain by one railway company (albeit a big one) for 20-30 years in the 19th century, so you have to be a real rail geek to know of its existence
Likewise,
I've seen it rendered as "Iron Way" too
Longer than I thought then
But still a lomg time ago
And then started to be converted to Standard from the 1860s with the last bit converting in the 1890s, by what I can see here
Yes but you need a boat to cast yourself out into the sea
I think you would need a submarine to find unspoiled "wilderness" in England and the UK
Our rate of forest cover is comparable to Mali and England is a very dense nation just as Bangladesh so there's a tiny amount of scattered ancient and young forest remaining
Personally I'm okay with it but I do wish we'd make some efforts to reforest even our small areas of moorland and in particular green the Midlands and North of England
If by head of state you mean political leader then you should know our current Prime Minister  *was* born in another country
It would w a shocker and would involve the death of lots of royals
Head of State
Never going to happen because Monarchy, unless it was on a trip, but even then, unlikely
Head of Government
Boris was born in New York, nobody cares
I’m honestly not trying to antagonise you or be woefully ignorant
Not at all, boris Johnson was born in America, and the only people who hate foreigners are his own party
Why would it be held against them
It would b upper controversial because it would mean that lots of royals were dead
Didn’t The Irish govt
relinquish claims to NI as part of the GFA
He is british though
I don’t think he’s ever held an American citizenship or dual citizenship
He hasn’t ever paid to the IRS
Just his birth that was foreign
there is German heritage, but the last officially German member entered the royal family in 1840 (Prince Albert who married Queen Victoria)
here's a nice article
Yeah, but still part of the “actual/legit” UK I guess and over half identify as British and it’s physical part of the british isles
Not a complete outsider
Born in Britain to an English father and Irish mother
Also Lived in the republic for 3 years
I understand it’s not that simple as its british but the the majority of the population wish to remain a part of Britain and that should be respected Until it changes
But currently it is 100% British
Canada isn’t part of the US even though it’s on the North American land mass
THe people of NI have a choice of citizenship and I respect that
But the country is british no matter your political aspirations
It’s physically on the island of Ireland
This means less than nothing
Because I’m right
I wasnt quoting
I was providing my own quote but using your logic
I’m glad you realise how silly it sounded
You are claiming that in the history of the world up until modern times there has never existed and island containing one or more nations
Hint hint there’s a triple next door, also the Iberian peninsula, also the Scandinavian peninsula, Guinea island, the list is endless is even from modern times
There’s also plenty of modern states in stupor that have no natural defences on their borders , The Netherlands, Belgium just for close examples
Also to add to that
Why would natural defences even matter anymore unless Ireland was planning some kind of attack that we all know would end badly
Yeah a province technically that is true but it has the status of a country
Yes it’s clear that one day the majority will indeed change
And allowing the vote is won and the republic can guarantee that they will be able to keep the peace then I will be pro UI
I’m really not mate
You just don’t like what I have to say
I even support a UI as long as the majority of the population of NI vote that way and the republic can guarantee the safety of everyone and don’t plan to make unionists second class citizens
I feel the same for any british territory/country/province Including the Falklands which is 100x simpler than NI because all the population wish to be british and Argentina never held the Falklands
Yes your by you are taking about the formation of borders 300 years ago and it’s losing relevance by the year
Of course but particularly between peaceful nations that is growing less important ever year
American and Canada for example
Many other modern European nations
You would have valid point if both the uk and Ireland were expecting war and lithos happened 200 years ago
Good point however britian is perfectly happy to make these sacrifices to keep the people of Northern Ireland safe
Personally i think all the newspapers except maybe the Daily Mirror and sometimes the Guardian are pro-Conservative Government
In the U.K. we have newspapers like the sun and the daily mail, which are very conservative that the left fears, and the actual government rn I don’t think there are any that they fear
All of them suck up to the government
> mostly
Utter bollocks
Unsubstantiated cliche meant to play to perception
Definitely not France
The germans, we both hate the french
(In my eyes anyway)
Yeah we hate England too
You guys are just salty because we've both defeated you, and saved your nation in the space of 200 years (Anglo gang rise up
We have a way of making other countries friends without making any ourselves
Except maybe Portugal and the USA
I feel like two rather large wars may have put a hamper on that
Damn Scots
They ruined Scotland
>our colony
You guys literally ceded Normandy to the Vikings, so if you wanna play that game, were a colony of the Vikings
There’s a brand in the uk called superdry (I don’t know if it exists in other european countries)
A lot of their clothes have Japanese  kanji characters on them I speak no Japanese so I don’t know but I’d bet they’re just random letters and words that mean nothing in the language but look cool to western eyes that aren’t familiar with them
I’ve heard in Japan they have the exact reverse where Japanese people who don’t speak English wear shirts with words like Milk on them
It's not even that new - in 1990 the travel writer Bill Bryson complained about it in *Mother Tongue*. In a section on "Engrish"
> I recently saw in a London
store a jacket with bold lettering that said: "Rodeo - 100% Boys For Atomic
Atlas". The jacket was made in Britain
Who by
Who for
I propose we send a load of t-shirts to the US with 'Podlasie' on them to see if they buy anything
You say that like it's a bad thing, but i really dont think it is or should be, it's not really that much more weird than wearing something with checkers or something, in lieu of some plain block colour of shirt
Not everything has to be utilitarian and sparse :)
So everyone thinks their national sense of humour is ‘dry and sarcastic’, got it
I wouldn’t call Brendon Gleeson a comedian
Are the dark jokes seasonal by any chance
True but a joke like the one Wolff_house posted wouldnt be acceptable in the UK
No worries mate
First think that pops in my head was when Gordon Brown had his TV mic still hooked up and started ripping into that old woman that he’d just had a chat to, proper cringe
Edit: [Full video]
Watching people fainting is so so scary to me for some reason
Chris Grayling
How on earth is he still a minister
Either jokes about the government or Brexit and weird newspaper headlines
people in the south are posh and Americans are idiots
We have a similar thing with a sofa store DFS
There's always tv ads about how the DFS sale is ending soon, but it never does
Tbf our government and the British people as a whole are historically known for carrying on as normal during crises, but fuck do I want a week off work
Probably that too
But really, he's just hugely incompetent
And considering our Government that's saying something
I don’t keep an active eye on other country’s politics but i’m always interested to hear about France, Ireland and to a lesser extent Germany’s politics
Mainly as I like to visit those countries the most
Not even interested in my own country's politics anymore let alone anyone else's.
I don’t know about place but The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town, he’s enough to put the shits up anyone
Really fuckin popular
When I was a kid it was the norm
I think kids now drink less and take less drugs
Lmao no they would just not sell it to you
There are 2 main parties in the uk - the conservatives, and the Labour party, but their are about 10 if I remember correctly, ranging from green, to ukip
Everything in NI is a but more complicated
The whole country is working on about 80 layers of nuance
TV License
You can easily get away with not paying it, but I think its important to have  channels that don't have advertising, and I think the BBC makes a lot of important programmes
From UK perspective
Normally you have: First name, Middle name(s) (optional), Surname (family name)
So you could have John (first name) James (Middle Name) Smith (Surname)
Your surname is usually the same as your father's, but there's no legality to that, just convention
You could take your mother's or take both, which is called "Double barrelled".
You could also be passed on a double barrelled surname which is not your two parents' surnames
For example, Daniel Day-Lewis; Day-Lewis being his father's surname and not a combination of his mother's and father's.
Technically you can have more than just two surnames with there once being a family with a quintuple-barreled name
But double-barrelled is the most common
Somebody's first name can also be hyphenated, such as Lily-Rose
This has definitely got more common in recent years
I don't believe there is a limit on how many middle names you can have
Some people have given their children the names of all the players in their football team
So, if you were particularly unlucky, you could be
Tyler-James Pickford Pope Alex-Arnold Chilwell Gomez Keane Maguire Mings Rose Stones Tomori Trippier Walker Alli Barkley Dier Henderson Maddison Mount Oxlade-Chamberlain Rice Ward-Prowse Winks Abraham Hudson-Odoi Kane Rashford Sancho Sterling Wilson Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville
Jewish people are spread throughout the western world and have significant integration, influence and power
Congolese people aren't comparable in this way
I think because of the setting also, they're not comparable
The Congo atrocities went down in Congo, not in Belgium, so it's not the same as with Germany when shit went down literally in front of the eyes of the people
Working on a cotton field
Probably working in the coal mines in Northern England, so that's fun
I died 14 years earlier
In the caribbean
Of course
The world needs to stand up to the CCP’s threats
Thanks
I grew up thinking Father Christmas lived in Lapland or Greenland
Edit: spelling
the “north pole” but the exact location is usually lapland
According to my tradition and my own research in partnership with The History Channel etc
What we refer to as Santa Claus is not actually of this Earth, it's an extraterrestrial shapeshifting being of pure energy who came to Earth many millennia ago before recorded history, it's origin is from outer space somewhere beyond The Kuiper Belt and deep into the Oort Cloud etc
But it's last known residence before arriving and living on Earth is theorised to of been the Jovian moon Callisto
But we don't know for sure yet
Always Lapland for us
Never Greenland
Wait
really
I've always grown up with the North Pole
Maybe its American influence growing up or something
Omg such a classic
I've seen people of multiple nationalities sit down in pubs expecting table service, ignoring all the people queuing at the bar, or being terrified that they're going to break some arcane British cultural faux-pas and be beaten up for it
> A lot of foreigners expect that Germany has a strong and unified culture
I think everyone does that about everyone else though
Like im aware of of Bavaria and how different it is to places like Stuttgart which is also different to Berlin really I doubt i'd be able to explain further than one place is more conservative traditional, one is hipster central and the other is super into manufacturing
Much in the same way im sure most Europeans wouldn't be able to explain the differences between areas of countries within the UK let alone the differences between the actual countries here
Pretty big thing in the UK due to the large Indian and Pakistani population here
So much so that honour killings are a bit of a topic as theres been a few high profile murders of women who have been killed by family members for not marrying the right person
Stone henge
It's awful
It looks like some cavemen made it or something
[Bridgewater Place in Leeds] isn't only awful architecture just because it's really ugly, but it's known for amplifying wind
when it gets windy, they have to close the road right by it
there was an incident once where a lorry got blown over and landed on someone, killing them
truly one of the worst buildings in history
Most houses in England are lines of connected brick blocks, I personally find them incredibly ugly
They look even worse when two connected houses paint their sides on clashing colours
By any chance is the sports hall used by priests
“Sure you can confess, or you can play ball
Beat me and it’s a clean slate”
Agreed
The irony of architects thinking they are innovative by aping a style that is almost 100 years old now
Ye, mandatory in secondary up to year 9
In the Uk-England-London
Yeah we had RE (religious education) where we learnt about why some Christians dont like abortion (and why theyre wrong) and also about various religions from the middle and far east
My primary was very pushy with Christianity,it ended up with most kids in my year group to call themselfs atheist by the end of year 6
It's compulsory here but kids can be taken out of the class if their parents wish
You learn about world religions, beliefs, values, philosophy, etc
It's called religious education in primary/early secondary and religious studies in later secondary
For me its a required subject until year 10 (14-15yo) where you can choose to drop it or not
A lot of schools may still make it compulsory though
I had compulsory  religious studies in GCSE
Depends on the school, but it's compulsory throughout the English system from Key Stage 1 to Key Stage 3 at least
That there's no go areas
Nottingham - it’s probably round about exactly in between the geographical and population centres of the UK
its not seen as particularly northern or southern and therefore biased towards one groups interests
Probably Birmingham
It is widely considered the UK’s second city
However, Edinburgh could be a good choice as capital of Scotland
York is also a favourite
It is capital of God’s Own County Yorkshire, which already makes it the most culturally, religiously, politically, strategically and economically important city in the world and, quite frankly, centre of the universe
Make it Randers
How many other towns have a rainforest
Does kinda have an aesthetic
Victorian redbrick, gothic and industrial architecture mixed with brutalism and modern shit
That's an incredibly Swedish answer, bravo sir
Bit like Vienna - used to be pretty central, now right over one side
yeah but you’re on r/europe, so
No UK, maybe I’m wrong but would assume that the population center of the uk is probably between London and Birmingham, while the geographic centre is probably just north of Leeds
I didn't say it was nice, but it's still an aesthetic
Fair enough, Manchester is way too northern though (not to mention disliked and distrusted intensely by northerners from Leeds and Liverpool) would rather have it be somewhere less culturally embedded in any particular regional identity so maybe York then
Also is so wealthy they can afford to keep windows open in their pubs all year round despite the heating bill
How many other Danish towns can boast that
I can't remember what it's called but there's building downtown that has a window open everyday of the year because apparently everytime the window is closed the building burns down
I think it's a pub but I'm not sure
It's an old timber framed building
Final round of trade deal coming up so we’re gonna find out in the next month
hopefully a lot
I think economically the UK’s financial services industry is always gonna be either a boon or a main competitor to the EU and we spur a lot of migration through it to get to London
We also are quite a market for consumer good and retail industries
Politically we always have liked to see ourselves as an intermediary between the US and EU
Uk leaders usually served as the Debbie downer when voting on new european initiatives, but I think Roy Jenkins was quite important as a proponent of the european movement leading the campaign to stay in in 1975 and then setting out the economic foundations for a single currency as head of the commission
By rejecting the opportunity to join at the beginning the UK probably also inadvertently set up the balance of power that France and Germany have with it
Why would a cheap market in Poland be good for Western countries products
A wealthy market means they can charge more
Apparently there are a lot of Portuguese dentists in the UK
Why Greece
I don't hear about them much anymore
How was the economy fairing before Covid, getting better
But corruption is a huge problem in Bulgaria
Course there are
Higher taxes, obviously, (though cheaper in the long run)
Wait times for non-emergency procedures can be longer, because everyone can get in line (which is like, the whole point)
In the UK even though equipment and quality of care are all top notch, a lot of the buildings are old and could do with renovations _at the very least_. Stuff like that
For the record, still 100% preferable to the alternative
Good lord, to think of how many people in my own family wouldn’t be here today (or would have died years earlier) were it not for the NHS
My mum developed cancer for the second time last year and had to undergo chemo, meaning she was greatly immunosurpressed _during a global pandemic_ (and in the UK where no less, where we were hit very hard)
They still took expert care of her; no more cancer as far as we can tell and her prognosis is very good
All thanks to the NHS which charged her not a single penny up front
We’re so lucky to have the NHS
Knowing that _everyone_ in my country has access to quality healthcare as a matter of moral principle is something I truly value about my country
P.S. a lot of people seem to forget that there absolutely are private healthcare companies in the UK
So it’s not even like there’s no choice
they’re really fast to offload you and don’t want to listen to begin with (maybe that’s just my bad experiences tho)
Polish
It's like Welsh but backwards
Maltese and/or Georgian
Maltese is just a melting pot of many languages like Italian, Arabic and English and Georgian, just, too many consonants
French
Just
why
Why would you want to speak, let alone *be*, French
Smdh
I think spoken Irish sounds fucking awesome
The orthography, however, is just bizarre
Around 8
45 was registration, you were 'late' if you turned up after 8
50 maybe
Lessons started at 9 and were an hour long
There was a break at 11am for 20 minutes
And 5 minutes between lessons 1-2 and 4-5
We had 5 lessons in a day and an hour for lunch
So we finished at 3
My school starts at 8:35 and finishes at 15:00
We have 5 lessons every and they are all an hour each
In the morning, we have to go to something called a form room where we basically check in to say we are in school
It’s basically a lesson where you just chat for 25 minutes (not included in the 5 daily lessons)
We then have 2 lessons back to back then get a 15 minute recess/break at 11:00 where we can go and get some food or just talk with friends until our next lesson
We then have 2 more back to back lessons until our lunch break at 13:15
Our lunch break is 45 minutes long and again we can just eat and talk to friends
At 14:00, we have our last lesson of the day then after that, we go home
For me, we get to school before 8:30 for tutor time(registration), start lesson 1 at 8:45, each lesson is an hour so we finish at 9:45 and the next one is 9:50-10:50, then it’s break for 20 mins, then from 11:15-12:15 and 12:15-13:15 we have lessons 3 and 4, then it’s lunch from 13:15-13:45, then lesson five from 13:45-14:45, and then the school day ends
My school is huge so each year has different things at different times, this is the year 10 and 11 (14-16) times
**Scotland**

On Tuesdays and Thursdays I'd usually have free time for my last two classes
Whilst In most schools we were effectively allowed to do whatever, in my current one we were meant to stay in and not go home
Most people however, simply snuck out
I usually hung about until about 5-10 minutes before the day ended before leaving, as that way I could get an earlier bus at 1540 without feeling too guilty
Whilst in England what I'd be in is considered college (Aged 17-18, A-level or BTEC courses), here in Scotland it is an extension of High School
16-17 year olds do Highers, equivalent to A-Levels but slightly easier and usually with a higher amount of courses, and 17-18 year olds do Advanced Highers, again equivalent to A levels, but this time harder and fewer in number
As I moved from England to Scotland mid-course, I had to hold back a year as I'd only just begun whereas due to a difference in term dates Scotland was nearing it's midyear exams, which I failed spectacularly, so I dropped out and had a gap year (went to italy, had a great time)
This meant at my new school I had to only do my highers, as I would be too old to take part in the Advanced Higher courses
Probably NYE
The only day where is socially acceptable to be overtly nice to strangers
Or the weekend of the August bank holiday, people tend to be happier then
I agree, I love hot weather, but the warm weather of spring seems so much nicer; its a refreshing feeling to be able to walk outside in a T-shirt after 6 solid months of overcast days and seemingly eternal drizzle
15°C today in London and I would call that warm
It was -1C only a month ago
So what do you call anything between 5-22
Or are you saying that's all chilly
[Jamie Vardy] couldn't be anything but English
Looks like he should be coked up on a Saturday night trying to fight a bouncer because he got kicked out whilst his girlfriend is screaming at him to stop
Dutch people look aerodynamic
Best way to describe them
Eh, I'd disagree to be honest
I live in London and you can always spot Italians
Yes, sometimes Spanish people here and Italian people can be mistaken for each other in their big puffy coats, scarves, gloves and wooly hats in like April but generally you can tell Italians apart, especially Italian men
Yeah my GF and I go to Austria pretty much every winter and are often mistaken for Germans
We don't really look different to Scots on the whole tbh
That's how we like to think we look lmao
I dunno
Maybe just the way they hold themselves
We associate mullets with Germans for some reason
It's considered trashy here too
Its also considered super trashy here
Yes and I know that because they're my people
I'm one of them
I won't as long as you gib us ya loighter
99% of people who come to England visit London and then leave
You do find some tourists in York, Bath and Cambridge as well as the national patks but outside of the capital, we’re really not a popular destination
An advantage of this however is that our cities aren’t swamped with tourists so you don’t get situations in Spain or Italy where local prices increase and it’s unpleasant for residents
London lol, not sure anyone goes anywhere else
People within the U.K. will go to Scotland, Cornwall and the eastern coast of England for holidays a lot, and cause it’s fairly small you could drive to somewhere early in the morning and get their, spend a while and maybe sleep, and be back home by late the next day
It’s actually 50% of tourists believe it or not
50% of tourists don’t visit london when coming to the UK
Bicester village is a big tourist destination, 95% of the people there are from China and they save up money to go there and have huge shopping trips (much cheaper for designer brands I believe)
I wonder what it classes as "leaving"? If you spend a week in London but go on a daytrip to Stonehenge does that put you into the 50% that leave London or is it 50% of nights/tourist hotel bookings are in London
If it does i'd imagine a decent percent are in that group with the rest like you say visiting Edinburgh
We get a fair amount of tourists in manchester/liverpool as well, the total amount of away fans for CL/Europa games will probably total a fair amount
Hey I'm from Kent
As for the question, everyone knows the main important states like Texas, California, Florida etc
For the rest, I'd say it's variable
Personally I know them pretty well but in general I think most people would at least recognise the name as being somewhere in America for the majority of them, even if they might not really know precisely where in America it actually is, or know much about that state
Even so, while most are probably vaguely familiar I wouldn't find it *too* surprising if someone told me they'd never heard of some states
I know all the US states and their capitals
I’m a but of a map nerd and get addicted to online geography games pretty easily
I can name 26/50 US states off by heart last I counted
Its pretty common knowledge the names of States
Many I can't name in that moment I'll hear and know its a state
Isnt there 46 and 4 are actually called commonwealths not states
Relatable
Americans took the name ‘Birmingham’ from our ‘Birmingham’, and they have the audacity to actually pronounce the ‘ham’ as ‘ham’ rather than ‘um’. Lunatics
My GF and I set ourselves the task of completing that once, just every evening we would quickly run through that once and i think it took us 6/7 evenings to get all 50
That was a year or 2 ago and now if we do it we usually gets to like 49 and forgest something like Connecticut
We also regularly fail at naming all the European countries, actually better at listing all the African countries than I am at remembering North Macedonia
You were arguing over who was more upset about something
Odd argument to have
I was first introduced to this difference when watching an episode of the Simpsons
Marge was buying Lisa a swimsuit and found one “with a star on the fanny
” I was shocked like, what the ACTUAL fuck is going on here
I can't think of any words in English though that sound the same but can be identified based on stress
They can only be seperated based on context (or seeing them written down)
Can you give me an example
English
It's my first language and I dont have a second but [English is stupid
Irish I've found is difficult, mainly with pronunciation, I've tried learning German and its quite easier in comparison
I kind of found Irish (Gaelic) hard when I was learning it
I'll only think that because I've spoken english my whole life
Never really thought about it to be honest
I suppose I will have to tell you in a month whether I miss it
Kinda I guess
I must say it's not really something that's on my mind all that much and I actively think about, even with Brexit
I live in the EU and always have done
For me that's just how things have always been
I don't know any different to compare it too
I will be sad to leave though
I like the ease of travel between EU countries, but otherwise I can't say I've had any strong opinions
I am aware the EU is a good thing but it's hard to think of too many ways it clearly affects ordinary people like me on a daily basis
Definitely
Although it's highly unlikely and almost impossible that we will go to war with any other European country, being in the EU gives an extra sense of security
Also, it's amazing being able to travel to other European countries freely without a Visa
I wish Brexit wasn't happening, if I was old enough to vote during the EU referendum I would've voted remain, and I still would now
Edit: From the UK
I am definitely glad
Same
That sounds nice
Seconded
Same
I’m desperately sad that my country (England) is being dragged out of the EU by my country (England)
Please don’t suggest that we voted _en masse_ for Brexit
Leave won in England with [54% of the vote] Not a landslide at all
Millions and millions of us did not want this
How’d you mean
I don’t.
We still get to experience all that and I think I get what you mean
There is something just a little bit exciting about going somewhere with a different currency, seeing all the different coins and notes and mentally trying to work out the exchange rate
It does add to the experience a bit
Well quite, I guess for the average person there aren't any obvious benefits on a general day to day for people who don't have much reason to leave the country
I think that's why a lot of people voted the way they did, they didn't realise exactly what benefits the EU has
Because they think there will be some kind of  trade deal or simply don't think about it
I have talked about this sort of thing with people who voted for Brexit and it is remarkable some of the 'logic' they use
I don't know the answer to your question, but you might find it interesting to compare the worrying situation of Irish with Welsh
That also had centuries of decline, but is looking a lot healthier now, and is probably the Celtic language with the brightest future if current trends continue
Operation Barbarossa is a huge interest of mine so I find these stories extremely fascinating
Please keep them coming
I love tap water
Usually have it with cordial and dont feel properly hydrated if I dont have it
So many people would feel so much healthier if they drank enough water
I wouldn’t actually mind paying a few cents in spain for tap water
Drinks (assuming you’re not in a seafront bar or in the centre of madrid/barcelona/valencia) are so reasonably priced there that water is only really bought when you actually truly need it
Whereas in Germany you either pay €6 for a proper drink or €3 for a bottle of water
Tap isnt even offered
It's fine but it's much harder than the rest of the UK
It can be unpleasant to some if you're not used to it
But when you live there you can't really notice it and it tastes fine
We’re all really poor and there is a lot of crime and murder, but nobody notices in the city because London is the only one people care about, and the country because there are a lot of countries worse off
uhh based
Thank you, finally some truth bombs
I think I may have heard Lodz said before but I cant be sure so I will say there
I play ETS2 so I basically know most of them
Still got stuck at Sofia though
Sofia was actually my first one, embarrassingly
although i recognised quite a few after it
At least your football club has a cool kit
Sounds pretty great
Even a small amount of knowledge of English is probably more than most English people know of another language
You might think your English is bad but it's rarely as bad as our command of other languages
For this reason, almost no English person will judge you for having bad English or getting things wrong, most English people will be impressed because they cant speak any other languages
Additionally, because it's an international language, we're used to hearing non-native speakers
So yeah don't feel shy about speaking
Other than that there isn't really any advice that doesn't apply to other languages
Learn your grammar, practise pronunciation, watch TV shows/films in English to see how English is used naturally, read books in English to expand your vocabulary - stuff like that
Kind of makes sense to have another letter to represent "Ch" because pronouncing the letters "c" and "h" together sounds nothing like the sound that "Ch" represents
Also, do you mean "Ch" like in English or "Ch" like in french
why does that make it one of the most difficult languages to learn
I really really want to learn Italian so I'm curious
Yeah in french I believe "Ch" is pronounced like "sh" in English
I don't think many languages actually have the "Ch" sound although I may be wrong
Yeah I never thought of that but you're right
Kind of a pointless letter really
thanks
I guess the best way is (unsuprisingly) listening to how the locals use the language
Every european country thinks they drink the hardest
Not the most
The hardest
Not quite
We officially use the metric system but measure our height in feet and inches, our distances in miles, and our personal weight in stones and pounds
In my country (England) us younger lot feel European as well, however the older generations feel strongly British and would probably cry if someone called them Europeans
A lot of them are changing though, so it could be better in 10 years time
Mmmm that’s good shit
To be fair one of the things that I find confusing about America is the race thing, in America you would still consider yourself African / Italian / German if your relative 300 years ago was from there and since then have lives in America
In Europe, or U.K. and Ireland at least, most people have a lot of countries mixed into them but still consider themselves from the country they were born / grew up in
Like for example I still consider myself British even though I got like 15 countries mixed into me because I was born and grew up here
Not quite
We officially use the metric system but in everyday life we use imperial a lot
We drink pints of beer, we measure our height in feet and inches, we drive miles etc
Several Spaniards have written about a losing their whiteness when visiting America, where they are sometimes treated as a Latino-American
Tbh when I say "European" I usually mean people from continental Europe and am not referring to myself
Yeah Scandinavia is effectively an island
You have to cross the sea or drive through Russia to get to the continent so it would definitely have an effect
Sound nice
You didn’t. I did
I think it's cause Europe is 'over there' for us
We have to cross the sea to get there so it's a big event for us
It's the place throughout history where we've either feared an invasion from or have had to go to to fight a war
Even things like having to change money makes it feel more foreign
I think it's largely an Island mentality thing
If you leave the door open - were you born in a barn
If you keep leaving lots of lights on - it's like Blackpool illuminations in here
From the UK here
My parents always used to say "carrots make you see in the dark" and "when the ice cream van plays music, it means they've run out of ice cream"
I believed them for an embarrassingly long time
"you'll get square eyes" was definitely a thing my mum used to say
If you say ain't or innit "You sound as common as muck" "Use the Queens English"
If you steal her chair when she goes to do something "You'd jump in my grave if you could".
If you keep asking her to do stuff for you "What did your last slave die of
The 'look with your eyes, not with your hands' is common here too
"It looks like a bomb's gone off in here"
I love this
"Stop crying or l'll give you something to cry about" was one I remember
We have a similar expression "Were you  born in a barn"? And I think the point is that isn't common, they're basically implying you're a savage that doesn't know how to live in a house
I've only heard it as bridge in the UK too
We say that here
Ditto
"It looks like a bomb site in here"
My mum used to say "It looks like a bombs hit it
Although not enforced, it’s illegal to be drunk in a pub
Can’t handle salmon suspiciously in London
It’s illegal to wear a suit of armour in the Houses of Parliament
Edit: all of these aren’t enforced but they are laws
Like nut free zones but for people who are allergic to gay
You’d also probably get done for carrying a weapon with intent to cause harm
You don’t just carry something on the off chance you might find a Welshman to shoot, you’d have to be actively hunting them lmao
More often than not, but definitely not always
You are going to have to name some accents that’s actually pronounce these vowels the same because it sounds like absolute crap
Not in my northern English accent, not in RP, not in Scottish, not in American English
The bog
Getting the Germans to say Squirrel
Having said that, there’s a video on youtube where some valley girls gets them to say it and its far closer to English than how she pronounces it
Get a German to say "squirrel".
Also, get an Irishman to say "thirty three and a third"
For those wanting the full version, it’s Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch
For an English one, try "naphtha"
I’d definitely call it Bonfire Night
Maybe it’s a regional thing
The time our beloved king, Henry VIII, decided he'd outgrown his wife and asked the Pope to marry a newer one
When he declined, he decided to create an *entirely new church* that he ran
His entire life was pretty ridiculous when you look into it
You'll have to expand on this mate, I tried googling for more info and found nothing about any Spanish province wanting to become an American state
I remember reading that Russian Cossacks had heard so many crazy stories about him, that they came to love him and desperately wanted to capture him alive
I have never heard either of those terms
We just call it ‘the Armada’.
The Monster Raving Loony Party in the UK proposed a 99p coin to save change
My city (Chichester) is a Roman city, and still has the Roman walls around the city centre
There’s an excavated Roman palace just a mile or so away, and Roman baths found under the museum (which was very handy, and immediately incorporated as a big open display
Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland was where the Roman’s drew the border, they built a 3ft wall which was meant to keep the Picts in the north out
I don’t see how they couldn’t have just jumped over to be honest
But that was the foundation of a split between England and Scotland
Roman Baths in Bath, Fishbourne Roman Palace,  Hadrians Wall, City Walls of Exeter
Theres a well preserved roman house in Dorchester
Theres quite a lot of small sites too
Most aren’t that well preserved but some have been “restored”
I'm no expert but I remember reading somewhere that iirc the Roman Army was preparing an invasion force of some 12,000-20,000 to invade Ireland from Wales/Angelesy(Irish piracy was also a pain in the Roman gluteus maximus, i'd imagine they'd want to deal with that at the same time too, two birds with one stone as they say) etc
But the Ireland invasion was shelved then abandoned all together as iirc the Romans were having trouble subduing Scotland and Northern England, so they focused their attentions there(I mean in the aftermath of invasion it took some 12,000 of the 32,000 troops that innitally invaded Britain) to be permanently stationed in Northern England just to maintain control and hold onto Northern England
That's alot
And as you said Ireland was much like Scotland in the sense that to the Romans Ireland did not have much of anything so valuable or desirable to make invasion and conquest worth their already increasingly stretched thin manpower, time and resources, The invasion of Britain was already an expensive af and difficult, drawn out lengthy process
I think the Romans were just like "fuck that we're not doing and or going through all that again" xD, plus by that time England was already one of the Empire's wealthiest and powerhouse resource producing provinces, Ireland was superfluous to requirements
Meaning in the end Ireland was just kinda ignored, more an afterthought never a priority
How different (or not different at all, like is it so far back in history to have no effect) do you think Irish history might've been if Rome had invaded and conquered Ireland
Who'd win in a battle/war
The Great Heathen Army(by far the greatest force the Vikings were ever able to muster up to facilitate and following up the invasion/conquest/settlement of England) vs The Roman Army(circa 117AD where under the Emperor and indeed ex-soldier Trajan the Roman military was at its peak and at its most capable/effective) etc
Who wins and losses and why
In reply to /u/ScriptThat too and in reply to anyone else reading as well
We have them in the UK, surprised you guys dont have them too
Living in London I see people do this all the time
Mostly Spanish people checking they're not speaking to a Portuguese or Italian person and then speaking in Spainish to them
I can tell you’re Spanish from the syntax of what you wrote
I’ve met a lot more Dutch travelling than Swedes
Correct, Adverbs of time usually come at the end of a phrase
Yep, here in the UK if a package can’t be delivered somewhere secure, like the inside of your building or to a neighbour, it’s sent back to the post office for you to pick up later
It can sometimes be a pain in the arse to get your shit back but it’s better than having it nicked
At least one company here has [been caught] "losing" parcels at the depot and then selling the contents at auction
Most of the problems we have with parcel delivery are the result of courier carelessness (at best) rather than light-fingered neighbours, I think
I dont think so
I have heard stories of packages being left with neighbors in blocks of flats which then go missing but I dont think thats normal
hey, it’s willy-nilly btw, not the other way around
no worries
I’m learning spanish atm so trust me I make way worse mistakes
Peterborough
Correct
When I was younger I'd sometimes go to the shopping centre there with my family
Even though I'd been there loads of times, I didn't think I'd really been to Milton Keynes
After-all, I'd been to the shopping centre there, but I'd never seen a church, old buildings, narrow streets or little pubs
You know, all the things that make an organic town
It wasn't until later that I realised that shopping mall I'd been to WAS Milton Keynes
That was their 'town centre' so to speak
Just a big shopping centre surrounded by big roads, roundabouts and disconnected housing estates
A car-centric 20th century disaster of urban planning that goes against everything that makes a place pleasant to live
Even their football team is soulless, having been transplanted from London like an American sports franchise
Can confirm
I live there
yep
agreed
Home of Goldie Lookin Chain tho
Ipswich maybe, but Yarmouth at least has a shit kind of charm to it
Plus if you include Gorleston there's a decent beach to go to
Nahhh it was nice when I went
Shite airbnb tho
Truly grim
Not a letter but a space in therapist can do some damage
In English, a simple comma can make all the difference:
• Let’s eat, Grandma
• Let’s eat Grandma
Brings a whole new meaning to ‘it’s raining men’.
That’s interesting
I did wonder if it was only English or it translated to other languages
University in Scotland is free if you're Scottish or from a non-UK EU country
However I believe that after Brexit only Scottish students will be eligible for this
I’m pretty sure in the U.K. it’s free up until a certain point, although annoyingly I think university is the one you pay for
It’s free until 18 I think
I've always wondered: do most courses require a proper qualification in the Swedish language, alongside entry requirements
Thats what I was wondering really
I know the otherway round, my university has some systems in place if you want to take a test with the university that you know enough English, or they accept certain relevant qualifications (i.e. obtaining a C/VG in Avgångsbetyg / Slutbetyg från Gymnasieskola, respectively)
Food, UK has much much cheaper food than most of Europe
Also, considering salaries, alcohol in bars and pubs is comparatively cheap compared to some countries in western europe (edit: the bars and pubs thing is except in London)
Unlimited* - read the small print
The reverse is the case in the UK, you can get really cheap wine here in supermarkets (only place I have been able to find cheaper wine in regular supermarkets was Moldova, but they have lower incomes so it would be more as a %)
Still think it's hilarious 'Three Mills Reserve White' has a IWSC Silver Award
It's £3
23 a bottle and 10
5% ABV, I use it for cooking
Lidl do even cheaper wines that that, like £2
69 for the cheapest
> Apparently because you eat twice as much of them as the rest of Europe combined or something like that
That is an understatement
UK consumers bought over 450 million units of Heinz baked beans 2010
The second highest in Europe was Ireland below 10 million; and Czech republic was much further down at 1
5 million; Australia came second globally at 60 million
The off brand beans are even cheaper, I brought a 400g tin of the store brand at Asda for £0
23p yesterday, they do a value version for £0
18p I think, I don't know why people buy the value ones though, they taste bad and are only 5p cheaper
Its not
It might be expensive for Europeans who come here if they have to go somewhere expensive to get quality products, for example bread that isn't the fake bread, but for the stuff most British people buy, it is very cheap
My hometown is a port to France and to Spain (Portsmouth), and you can get some insanely cheap (and bad) wines from the stores near the port on the French side
Pensioners travel there on £10 return tickets from the local newspaper just to buy wine and tobacco
For example  [  £1
49 for a 750ml bottle of wine
There exists a lot of people who will eat baked beans 3-7 times a week, particularly poor people (council house food we call it)
It sort of acts like our version of rice for Asians
We'll eat mash potato, fish fingers and beans; chips, burger and beans; sausages, potato waffles and beans; baked beans on toast is a snack; we mix it with rice; and of course we occasionally eat it in a cooked breakfast
And it's known as "1 of your 5 a day" meaning its treated like a fruit or vegetable in a way
You get the idea, it's incredibly important to our cuisine in a way, even if its just not the bright side of it
Yeah its with yellow rice though, not white rice
And you'd include it as part of the normal dinner so you'll have a fish burger or something else on the side
It's poor people food, efficient and cheap
yes, until i go outside
I adore them
So if you call a manatee a sea cow what do you call the extinct Stella’s sea cow

I thought rabies had a fatality rate of like 99
99% (edit: 14 of 17,500 people have survived; only 99
92% fatal lol)
Only a handful of people have ever survived it, and they were basically vegetables afterwards
Around Wiltshire (Salisbury Plain especially) there are warning signs for tanks
I was never quite sure what I should do if I saw one
Perhaps hide in a bush and wait for it to pass

I hear they're mostly territorial but can be very dangerous if they feel threatened

If anyone knows anything about getting rid of Danes, it's the English
Unfortunately for you, if anyone knows anything about getting shit faced in a foreign country, its also the English
That's sick (and I don't mean in the good way)
We only have a Prime Minister in the UK but the Prime Minister
Here are some differences: The president is a head of state but the PM isn’t, The king/queen is the head of state unlike the US (they have little to no power though), Prime ministers actually aren’t technically elected
The queen appoints the prime minister to the job (it’s always the one with the most votes though)
I think the PM can write laws and the president has to suggest them (I’m unsure on that one, it may be false
I didn’t know there was a Europe day
I find there aren’t many flags generally, the only time I have seen a lot of flags is in London
I live in the countryside so there’s not really any government buildings here
Edit: Grammar
I'll be displaying it, but you'll be shocked to hear that it's not common here
At the moment in the UK the EU flag has almost become a protest symbol
I’m literally in an uber as I write this comment and I just went past a building with an EU flag flying from it’s roof
Siiiiigh
Oh well
I'd be surprised if it's an obligation, at least from the EU
Kes (1969)
Bølgen (2015)  English title: The Wave
While I think of it, there was a really odd Hungarian film I caught a bit of many years ago and am curious about
It seemed to be some sort of satire on sport, with a competitive eating champion training for a big competition
I particularly remember some sort of box he had to vomit into while the trainer turned a handle for no apparent reason
Such a good film
I love the scene with the man who comes out the toilet
I could (and have) spent hours trying to figure out the moral or the relevance of the story he tells but I’m either too dumb or it’s meant to be ambiguous
probably both LOL
Those nude scenes were certainly
extensive
I’d be more concerned if it was a happy go lucky film about heroin addicts because the reality is once your life revolves around heroin you’ll neglect or backstab whatever gets in the way
That’s the truth of the situation
Trainspotting is a film that explains or at least gives an insight into the mind of a junkie, it sounds like you want a film with a happy resolution
The two don’t agree
Yeah fair enough, it is depressing and sad in a lot of ways
I guess I’m the opposite in that I revel in the grittiness of it
It is hard to watch but some of my favourite music can be hard to listen to because it’s sad etc, for film it’s similar

Ideologically I skew somewhat centrist libertarian so I quite like Macron although he seems to spend a lot of time trying to get media attention rather than getting on with anything
Mark Rutte and Pedro Sanchez both seem like decent leaders as well
The Queen is our head of state, not the head of government
That’s the prime minister
Me too
Good idea
Hardly, she's pretty much as British as can be
Its not like other people don't have ancestors from other places yet we don't say Boris Johnson is Turkish or Nigel Farage is French
For English, I love the fact that a description I saw for it is "English is actually 3 languages in a trench coat pretending to be one"
Not purely language but in the UK if you use any noun while saying ‘absolute’ before it, you can make it into an insult
For example “You absolute pineapple” could be used to call someone stupid
“You absolute bus station” could also be used to call someone stupid
“You absolute pencil sharpener” could be used to call someone stupid and it goes on and on
They aren’t usually offensive insults but more of a funny insult
Like if your friend does something stupid, just compare him
to any noun
I love that its nearly impossible to replicate the British accent and sound like a native compared to other languages in Europe
Why do we always have put our language down
All our food basically
Steak and Kidney pie usually gets some strange looks when I mention it to foreigners
I'm guessing its the aversion to eating Kidneys rather than steak
Gravy and chips
I’d imagine battered fish might be unusual, IIRC many mainland European countries prefer their fish actually looking like fish, complete with the eyes (which many people over in England find nauseating)
Black pudding is also a disgusting conception when I think about it
Iv had frogs legs and snails in the north of France and it was bloody delicious
Growing up I used to eat corned beef sandwiches with ketchup on white bread
Even I think it sounds disgusting but I loved it
Lol
I think we both have lacking food cuisines due to our climate
I was literally talking to an American friend of mine about this today
I’m encountered Americans before who told me British food was bad before admitting they’d literally never tried any traditional British food
Yeah I agree bunnies have been s staple of british food for centuries
Fallen out of favour with most people now but I eat them all the time
Beautiful meat
So is woodpigeon
But I couldn’t imagine eating songbirds
When I had them thy were like little lumps of chewy beef
But not too bad
Check morrisons
To be fair we eat loads of lamb and that isn't really that common across Europe
Yes that’s Scotch eggs you’re thinking of, great for just a snack or a side to go with your lunch or potentially a meal of its own if it’s big enough
How much sunlight do you get in the summer
In northern england we have just slightly longer winter days 7-4 and the seasonal depression is bad enough here so it must be bad for you
Although our long summer days are really nice, its never technically night and only dark between about 11 and 330
Yeah, its weird how Americans in particular think London/ the UK is "so rainy" but think the rest of Northern Europe has better weather than us
I saw a post from an American guy a while ago who said he didnt want to visit the uk due to the rain, so was going to ireland or Sweden instead
London has 106 rain days per year, which is less than both Dublin and Gothenburg
Yes
Blimey, that's a bit much
Love the idea of a guy seeking sunnier weather with you guys, though, haha
"Tamam" is as good a word as "okay", to be fair
I would tell him that another war happened
And  the industrial revolution happened and that people have been to space and technology is something that most people can’t live without and that the earth is slowly warming up
IMO The City feels more modern than Canary Wharf which feels kinda dated and little 90s/early 2000s. The City is where you see the super modern architecture
Probably hull, at least out of all the major cities
Although that article says the name of the island Iona in Scottish Gaelic is Ì.
Not a town but there’s the River Og which
Omg this sucks
The closest major language to English is probably Dutch and that is still completely unintelligible

Why is it a sin of adding ova to female surnames
, I mean is -ova Czech
, It is quite common for Czech females to have surnames to have this suffix is
Why is it so bad
I watch alot of Time Team, and one thing ive learned is that in the long run no buildings are permenant(no matter how big or impressive)
So 850+ years is very good run, its really not the end of the world nor is it a tradegy as history never stops, something else always comes after
But being brutally honest: It holds no special significance or importance or meaning to me
I mean jts just a cathedral ultimately, and they're a dime a dozen in Europe
I feel like some of the reaction to this fire is a bit ott and hyperbolic, overblown
and its only because of where it is
Nobody would care if it was in Eastern Europe or even further afield outside of Europe etc
So yes its unfortunate it went up in flames, but its the nature of very old wooden buildings after all
Theyre tinder boxes
Often times its a matter of when not if it bursts into flames
Its happened countless times throughout history, it'll happen ago too when your dealing with such a long time scale as these buildings are on
I look at this being merely another chapter in Notre Dame's long storied history, its nothing to get so upset about imo
Agreed, this could easily be a landmark at home and it's just daunting to see such an important part of culture in flames
We call them horns here too
Not sure where you get the idea we call them klaxons
In the uk it’s somewhere in between on horn honking it’s not totally accepted but generally if you do it people will probably just think you’re an asshole rather than it being particularly aggressive
As usual in Britain where manners are everything we have more cases of the opposite where minor gestures of annoyance actually mean the person is furious
To ‘tsk under your breath and shake your head is the British equivalent of yelling “I’m fucking furious”
I am English, when attempting to be polite, we usually go the other way and express hostility as mild irritation
The horn thing is also law here, only to be used in emergencies but living in a high immigrant area of London you hear them all the time - where i'm from you never hear them
We only use the word klaxon for alarms on gameshows
I don't think I've ever heard it in any other context
I sound more confident in German and a bit ruder compared to English
That's just how humans are
I moved to London from the East Midlands of England and I fucking love it
While I accept that living preferences are subjective and it's certainly not for everyone, London is a wonderful city and honestly I do feel the impulse to defend it when people get salty
Likewise, the idea of living basically anywhere else in the rest of the UK, at this point in my life, sounds like pure fucking hell
Different strokes, innit
Edinburgh
Monaco
I don't hate London, I hate the fact that people assume bc I'm from England I'm from London
My first 40 years in London, thinking it's a bit crap, followed by moving out and now *knowing* it's more than a bit crap
Yep, fuck London
Cheaper
The last one I can think of is over Suez in 1956
We very occasionally have coalitions (there have been 7) or minority governments
But yes, No Confidence motions are particularly hard to pull off
We learn languages in Secondary and sometimes Primary schools, the most common ones are Spanish, French, German and occasionally Mandarin
Most people go on to take a language as a GCSE (exam) subject, but few people would actually consider themselves bilingual
Having a second language is considered extremely useful, and, like in many other countries, employers are more likely to hire people with more languages under their belt
Like Ireland we're very much in the second category
It's certainly not something taken for granted
Barely anybody speaks a different language, around 1/5 speaks french and 1/10 German or Spanish, but there is not really a point to as we invented probably the most learnt / spoken language worldwide
In the UK everyone is expected to know basic English, but many think it’s optional
(Geddit
Yep, this pretty much sums it up
I love the Netherlands urban cities, rural villages, canals, cycling culture, and food
When the french don't like what politicians are doing the bloody well let them know about it
If we have fuel duty rises today, there will be a mighty mumbling and grumbling you will be able to hear from literally feet away
I get the impression that French people genuinely love being French, which is nice
Skirt wearing trend setters  Independent, tight knit communities, proud people
Edinburgh rain or shine is my favourite city in Britain
Passionate people, grafters, the Welsh language has survived
(no thanks to us), Rugby and singing
Humourous story tellers, musically gifted, Whiskey and Guiness
Resisting the Anglo/American way of life
Cosmopolitanism
France is the first image I'd have if you asked me to describe the word, "culture".
European values and institutions, multilingualism,  and egalitarianism
Ingenious old revivals, modern nation
Laid back and cool country
Equality, hygge and an educated society
99% of Denmark's Jews survived WW2 for a reason
Folk traditions, lovers of the great outdoors (Norway's outdoors is hard to beat), generousity and the public oil fund
Christmas traditions, engineering, sauerkraut and Jürgen Klopp
White pudding is really nice
Do you not queue properly
Stroopwaffle and other Dutch snacks :)
True, but then again you are French
I think he means cause we invented them
I agree, but white pudding is nice when you want something a little milder
Nigel Farage, for those of you that don’t know he was a massive part of the brexit campaign and is terribly racist
I think most of England would say Katie Hopkins tbh
Probably Piers Morgon
We would be better without him
Only one
If I could I would ban most our politicians but if I could only choose one person to be banned from England it would have to be Donald trump because he is an arsehole
He's a grown man who threw a tantrum over a sausage roll
He's also said some disgusting things before
He's not alright
Imagine school if your name was Toyota Prius lol
I really like the museum of London, along with the Museum of London: Docklands
Very detailed exhibits
Bovingtonn Tank Museum or IWM Duxford (planes)
Both two of the best I've seen if you're interested in tanks or planes
I really enjoyed the Uffizi but I feel it could be perceived as boring to some people
Creepy medieval portraits and Jesus for days
Oh, so much Jesus
I know it’s usually considered the least of the golden triangle but when I was in Madrid I found that the Thyssen had one of my favourite collections of any art gallery I’ve been to
>Less common languages
When it's your kids bedtime so you speak to your wife in North Sentinalese
They speak Sentinalese, which is probably a member of the now engangered Adamanic family
Nobody's really sure though, and I think that's for the better
My native language is English and I FUCKING HATE that we expect everyone to speak English
Annoys the shit out of me
But of course I really appreciate foreigners trying
Even more so when I see they can speak Portuguese which is my other language
What I think many other Europeans don't understand, especially many people in this sub is how understanding a broken language is a skill
Because most people learn English and not everyone is great at that, as a first language English speaker you work to understand broken English from French, German, Spanish, Indian, Chinese, Dutch etc etc and not get confused at missing words or completely mispronounced words
If I speak German or French to someone and mess up I find I get made to feel like a fucking idiot even though they can't pronounce various key words in English
I always do the 'Hallo/Guten tag
urrr, spraken ze inglish
' and just feel so uncomfortable the entire time
That’s actually a really fair point
My attempts at speaking French in Paris only seems to annoy French people more
My mum is fluent and even she gets rude comments for mispronouncing things from French people who can barely pronounce anything in English correctly
Yeah I get that
Like we all need a language we can speak over the internet
But the sense of entitlement when we go abroad really bugs me
I do think it’s getting better though
North of England = burning coal
South of England = dandelion and burdock
A UK wide one is the smell of stale beer/booze you find in an old pub
Dunno what England as a whole would smell like but Cornwall would probably smell like fish, salt and slurry
As a smell, it's remarkably pervasive
Yes, Somerset and Devon would smell similar but swap the Fish with cider/beer or ice cream
Self hate isn't healthy
Should be allowed for medicinal use
And recreational in moderation and with certain restrictions
Your lawmakers ruin their lives
I agree it can be damaging, but what about those of us who use it responsibly
I don't believe my mug of weed tea at the end of the working weed should be illegal just because a minority may choose to abuse it
I genuinely used to confuse Spain and Italy all the time when I was a kid
I didn’t fully get that they were two completely separate countries
Similarly, I assumed the US was level with us
I thought New York was right across the sea because the weather seemed similar
I had no idea how far North we are
There isn't a single part of the UK that is more southerly than any part of the US (apart from Alaska)
Me too
I was only young but I thought that something ww2 related happened in Scotland on a beach
It just sounds so Scottish
It took me a while to figure out the difference between UK and GB as well
Weird how you can speak english and use reddit but arent aware that its totally not the norm
Usually I would go to Caffe Vergnano and buy their ground coffee
I'm English and once was seeing a German girl
It was a novel experience
Had to make sure she knew I was joking some of the time
Dont think the banter culture is as strong there
I learnt some german and she was always quick to point out  when I got it wrong
Something i dont think we do here in England very much
Sounds very negative but it was actually very positive
those are the just the differences that stuck out to me
I’ve dated two Romanian women in the past and they were polar opposites of each other, one big city girl and the other country/small town girl
Had lots in common with city girl and full of energy culturally very similar; was fun relationship shame she had to move back home to care for family
The other one was opposite, work driven and quite religious which was quite a conflict with my agnostic beliefs; she was also quite guarded and hard to crack
Culturally not much difference in my opinion, was great visiting there and seeing the lay of the land from local point of view rather than tourist
Hospitality wise I loved it, I’ve never ate so much or felt like I should eat so much in my life, I love their food especially Sarmale and mici
Always made to feel like one of the family and loved to hear general conversion, even if it was about the most mundane trivial subjects sounded like passionate debates with a lovely flow of words which was nice on the ears
I’m English and my boyfriend is from Northern Ireland
So yes and no
Im English and had that same thing with a german girl
Had to make sure she knew I was actually joking
The banter culture isn't as strong
i think they also find it harder to laugh at themselves on the continent
I think those pet names must be regional because they are super common up north
I think that must’ve been a rare case as majority of people take their shoes off, especially in a strangers house and even more so with carpets
As a brit iv never known anyone who doesn't take their shoes off in the house
Yeah 100% all my mates love several times a day
Even men call each other love l
Gorgeous, darling, sweetheart etc
Could go on forever
I once got a message from a polish friend asking me “do you eat
Turns out the difference between “do you eat” and “are you eating” is pretty unique to English
Very often people fuck up how to properly say ‘coke’ and end up saying ‘cock’.
I used to work at a busy pub in London which got a lot of tourists, and hearing someone say “I would like a cock” or “can I get two cocks” happened multiple times
Rest in peace in peace
>”pretty unique”
English is one of the few languages that distinguishes between those tenses
Not really
hahah no it's not that big of a deal
Absolutely not, where I'm from we use it often
Used in public
Not really
It’s a swearword obviously but no one gives a shit unless you’re being particularly loud
around children kinda big deal but anywhere else not big deal
Haha nope, a lot of people really dont care if you swear, any swear word, but nothing derogatory (racist, homophobic etc (you can be charged)) but yeah most people dont care, just maybe older people and people with children
Depends on the workplace
If you aren’t dealing with public and talking with colleagues and not bosses it’s usually fine
Non English speakers tend to use English swear words to sound more acceptable than their own swear words
Especially in Germany they will have English swear words on tv in the day and stuff like that
Sounds like you might have visited my Nan in the home mate
Never heard anyone say heck that wasn’t an American
Maybe middle class England
Definitely mate
A (a) i (i) o (as in oh) and I can say of the top of my head ins Pankaj there's y (and) and in French there is á (at)
I think it’s normal to know your family member’s wages and a few very close friend’s wage but if someone I just knew slightly and asked me what I was on, I’d never tell them
Neither are particularly common
With Spanish food you'll usually get green olives, with pizza you usually get black olives
I prefer green but I'd say they are equally popular
Not the same in Scotland
Scottish Gaelic went away largely as a result of self-imposed restrictions, directed by Scots in the Lowlands
There's nothing funny about it, you just don't know what you're talking about
The Scottish crown and parliament had long sought to build a unified state and actively engaged in persecution in the 1400s and thereafter
The core Gaelic region was squashed and rebellions quenched, land was forfeited and the lordship of the Isles was removed as early as the mid-late 15th century
The Scottish Parliament started plantations in Gaelic regions of Scotland during the late 16th century, the Statutes of Iona and School Establishment Act 1616 forcefully pushed the English language on Gaelic communities; the latter stating "Inglis be universally established, and Gaelic be obliterated because it is a main cause for the barbarity and incivility of the people of the Isles and Highlands
If we go further ahead into the Highland Clearances (1750-1860) - which is where any English involvement can be ascertained - then you should be aware that the majority of landowners and industrialists who were evicting the Gaels were Scottish themselves
You're weird
I walked on my own through several twisting alleyways to get to school when I was 8, in a country known these days by some for being
crime-y. Looking back, I realise that my parents may have made a judgement error
Interestingly many non-standard native English dialects don't actually make the was/were distinction
[See here]
> The construction ***she were*** *wearing a mask* might sound unusual to some ears, but in some dialects in northern England and the Midlands, many speakers indicate the past tense of ‘to be’ by saying *I were*, *you were*, *he*, *she* and *it were*, *we were* and *they were*. This means the verb is **unmarked for person**, while speakers of Standard English differentiate by using *I was* and *he*, *she* and *it was*. Some dialects, perhaps particularly those in the South East of England, favour a similarly unmarked version using the singular form of the verb *I was*, *you was*, *he*, *she* and *it was*, *we was* and *they was*.
One thing that seems to be fairly common is our progressive tense
The difference between "I drive to work" and "I am driving to work" is confusing for a lot of ESL speakers
Also our use of the auxiliary "do" - I've seen things like "I don't can that" instead of "I can't do that"
Pen drive is correct I've definitely heard that before
An example I found:
Also known as pen drives, USB flash drives use flash memory to store and transfer data between devices that are fitted with USB ports
[link to example]
I never knew that Americans didn't pronounce the h in herb and I've just checked and you're right
I was going to comment and say you definitely pronounce it
You know what, I think you're probably right
If I heard someone with a non-native accent speaking like that I probably would assume it's an unintentional error rather than that they were specifically trying to use a northern/midlands dialect feature
There is something of an expectation that second language learners will learn the standard language
That one is *far* more common than just Scotland actually
I'm down in Kent and hear it plenty (and I'll admit I probably do let it slip out myself from time to time)
I assume it's just a widespread non-standard variant rather than being restricted to any particular area
It's probably more class based than anything
Edit: Another good one which is widespread (and is mentioned in the article I linked) is past tense come
So like *I come* instead of *I came*. Apparently this one though is actually the older version, rather than the standard one, which is pretty cool
I know what you mean
For some reason certain ways of saying things will just get on your nerves a bit haha
My dad does the come one *a lot*! I think it's most noticeable when he does it with he/she
E.g. saying something like 'when he come back' for 'when he came back', since for the other pronouns it just sounds like the present but here it sticks out even more cos it lacks the -s ending that he/she have in the present tense
This feels like the most interesting one to me
I don't know much about the Azerbaijani diaspora but I would guess its rarer for you guys to bump into a fellow countryman than, say, it is for me elsewhere in the world
For me it's crazy the other way around
Like in some countries it's compulsory to have it on you at all times
The idea that I could get in trouble for not having any ID when going to buy some eggs is crazy to me
We don't have official IDs so we use our driving licences
I only ever bring mine out if I'm buying alcohol or going to a pub/club because I have a baby face
Yeah but what if you're not going to anything governmental or financial
What if you're literally just buying eggs and bread
Is it a requirement then
While London has definitely been *the* biggest for a long long time, the other major cities have changed around a bit
I know historically places like York and Norwich used to be very major cities at one point, whereas nowadays they're pretty far down the list
I assume it would still be a southwestern settlement
Maybe Hafnarfjordur or Kopavogur
Was gonna say eyup a minute then noticed you said *capital* city
1/3rd of Sheffield lies in the Peak District good sir
Very green indeed
We all know that's actually Rotherham come on
Ive three questions
To any a non-native English speakers reading:
**1
** What did the English language sound like to you before you learned English
And also what does English sound like to your non-native ears
, is it a harsh or soft sounding language and when an English speakers speaks what do they sound like
, And in general what sounds/noises do you associate with English
**2
** What did the various English accents(English/Welsh/Irish/Scottish/American/Canadian/Australian/New Zealand) etc sound like to you before you learned English
, Could you differentiate them
**3
** And lastly does English sound like a Germanic language to your ears
My options for Erasmus were between universities in Prague, Istanbul, Amsterdam and Tampere, Finland
Just seemed weird to have these cities renowned throughout the world for their history, architecture and grandeur, and then just
Tampere
Like I'm sure it's probably lovely but it just doesn't seem to fit in with the other three
Yeah, if they have a little Spanish flair next to their tag, they're probably Spanish
You can tell a lot by queueing etiquette
The most chaotic of which I've witnessed is the Chinese version
I.e there is no queue
Its a free for all
They are all talking at the same time
Its survival of the fittest
Working on a cruise ship in guest services we had to literally shout and order them back into the queues
Odd-looking modernist specs is something I associate with Germans, particularly but not exclusively middle-aged German women
Like, take the text off the cover of [this book] and he still just *looks* German
Hahaha man this made me laugh
For me the germans that come to my hometown are always I  hiking gear , little shorts and those walking sticks
My personal favourite was watching a German tour group huddled around a war monument, listening to their tour guide who had stood up on it to loudly direct and speak to the group
I don't think he realised and it was innocent but it gave me a hefty chuckle
I could see some older English people in shock
Its absolutely true
At least in my hometown
Its really American sounding to me
They are also real high if not the highest in percentage of blondes
We have letting the cat out of the bag which is like giving away information too soon
English doesn't really have anything like that
There isn't one single authority on the English language
We seem to manage just fine without one though
I think Irish is a pretty cool language
Yeah, all of the silent letters and everything and how mh makes a v
And we break them constantly
I really like Beadnell bay in Northumberland
otherwise in the uk as a whole Pembrokeshire coast national park in Wales and some of the beaches in the outer Hebrides particularly the Isle of Harris are beautiful
Saw them live at hyde park years ago
a lot of fun
It'd be a damn shame not to mention the Newcastle-Sunderland split
I would actually say Newcastle and Sunderland for England
Not an animated movie, but there's a video kn YouTube I can't find right now talking about the use of accents in Witcher 3
For instance ancient spirits and the like have Welsh accents because the Welsh language is ancient
They also tried to use accents that weren't common in fantasy media, such as the Viking-inspired Skelligers being Northern Irish and many of the peasants having Birmingham/West Midlands accents
Not quite the same thing as I’m English so the English-speaking films won’t be dubbed for me, but in *The Death of Stalin* I really liked the character of Georgy Zhukov
He was originally born to a poor peasant family irl, so in the film the character spoke with a northern English accent (IIRC the actor that played him, Jason Isaacs, is from Liverpool), the accent often being synonymous with the working class in England
There are plenty of different dialects in England and in general I find the north of England is much less homogenised than the south
I live in Yorkshire which has its own dialect
Some old people use "thee" "tha" and "thy" but that is mostly dying out
In fact the whole dialect is dying out a bit but the same is true with all dialects
There are towns in North Yorkshire where everyone sounds like a southerner - makes me shudder to think
if I go to London with some people from my city, they will not have a clue what I'm saying
Erm well kind of, the huge amount of accents in England each have different phrases and words
Sometimes, as someone from the East Midlands, its hard to understand a Scouser or a Geordie
That's accents
Dialects died down with railway travel and the homogenisation of media and education, though there does still exist significant differences but not as much as there used to be
There's a lot of dialects: Cumbrian, Yorkshire, East Midlands, Northumbrian, Scouse, West Country etc
You're probably very aware of a Yorkshire dialect with things like:
- isn't = int
- didn't = dint
- hasn't = ant
and I'm sure there's a lot I'm missing out
And for where I'm from (East Midlands) we have things like:
- yours = yorn
- hers = hern
- ears = tabs
- lunch = snap
- got her = gorra
A lot of our dialects have been diluted so maybe if you're older you would probably know more
For Yorkshire, there's loads of dialect words
Sumat/nowt/owt : Something / Nothing / Anything
Thee/Thou : Formal you/Informal you
Parky : Cold
Mither : Bother
Bait : Food (this is actually separate to the common word of bait and comes from the old Norse beit)
Foss/Force : Waterfall
Ginnel : alley
Skrike : cry/scream
I mean there's literally hundreds of words like that, those are just the ones I've personally heard with any degree of frequency
Yeah I'm from Lancashire and Yorkshire, while similar, definitely noticeable difference
Manchester seems to have a selection all its own, mind
This is going to cause an argument as its a complex issue and not even worth going into detail
Ireland fully blames all of the issues with Northern Ireland on England (which is mostly correct) but a good portion of the blame also lays with Scotland due to the plantation of Scottish lords
Quit often Irish people will joke that its them and the Scots against the English in this world forgetting;
Caveat; I cannot stress how much im not saying England are clean here
Im just saying the memes of Celtic brotherhood and all that and 'yeah we all hate the English together' aren't quite inline with history
England gets blamed for starting the transatlantic slave trade when it was the Portuguese
We were also the first to ban slavery but that gets scribbled out of the history books as it doesn't fit the narrative of 'England bad'.
The Bengal famine during the Second World War
I won't go into the details, but put simply, it was more to do with Japanese commerce raiding and woeful mismanagement by the largely Indian local governments of India
It also may have originated in east Asia, or Kansas, or in a number of other places
It is, however, unlikely that it was Spain
I think the argument is that its equally Wales and England's fault seeing as Wales voted in line with the final result
Also can we add voting in your own countries interest to that
I voted remain and I can understand why Scotland is angry about Brexit, and I support them if they want to leave the UK, but I'm tired of this whole narrative that its just English people that are selfish cunts that don't care about the rest of the UK
Scotland didn't decide to stay in the UK out of altruism, they did it because they thought it would be better for Scotland
I don't recall them ever discussing or caring how it would affect the rest of the UK if they had left
We're not the only ones that just think of ourselves when we vote
Britain created some of the earliest concentration camps during the Boer war of 1900-1902, but most people have forgotten that and just think concentration camp = Nazi Germany
I guess we got away with that one
They weren't death camps though, that was a uniquely German thing
yep, that's how the British empire was created as well, just 'helping out' one set of natives against another
Am I wrong
Perhaps you would like to educate me
When you cannot reasonably deny your ancestors were utter bastards, it seems pointless arguing over who was worse, since everyone in the past was a bastard
Personally I take the view that most of history is rich people doing bad things to poor people, often with the connivance of other poor people
Performing arts perhaps maybe is one
Not offered by every school in England but it's taught as a compulsory subjects in many
I had Performing Arts in my first years of secondary school
It was drama, theatre studies and music rolled into one at a much larger scale
One week we'd be in the classroom the next week we'd be in the theatre performing plays and learning about how theatres work
In primary school we did reading comprehension
Essentially we'd read a text and answer questions about it
Not in a sense of analysing (as in English literature lessons) but just questions that test that you've actually understood what you've read
Often it would be a short story and in early years the questions would ask simple things like "what colour was the car" and then later on it would be more things like "why did X character do this" (but obviously the motives would be pretty simple)
I think the difference is the way the subjects are divided up
We did food tech (essentially cooking), wood work, sewing/textiles etc
but they were all separate subjects (although came under the umbrella of "technology" or "tech")
>Also our "geography" (called earth studies literally here) might or might not be different than in other countries as it's not just about maps but more about how the earth works (weather, climate) but also issues of developing countries
Basically everything related to earth
This sums up my Geography education here
Oh yeah, big time
See our museums full of other nations' treasures, our crown with an Indian jewel as it's centerpiece
Also, all our national heroes are other countries' villains; Churchill in India, Cromwell in Ireland
We were a very bad people with very good PR
Also
Is it scOHne, or scon
Is Cromwell really regarded as a national hero here
>a very bad people
Compared to who
>Ulster Plantation
>UK; Ulster got civilised
Said no one ever
Basically the Irish Victims guide to history
chip on shoulder noted
Nothing about the Raj or the Slave Trade
You must be ancient
These have been part of the curriculum for years
There was a famous, possibly apocryphal, exchange between a German diplomat and a French one at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, with the German upset that it laid responsibility entirely on Germany
DE: "What will history say
FR: "History will *not* say that Belgium invaded Germany
If you're a republican
Just objectively, not relatively
Pointing out other nations were bad too doesn't ameliorate our own behaviour
It should be said that the main statue outside the HoC is over 100 years old so its quite hard to move due to it being a protected monument
Its also controversial even today and was even controversial when it was built - the Conservatives at the time actually voted against it and it only passed due to unionists in NI
Yeah, wouldn't surprise me if it had been vandalised a few times over the years
If Stalin lived 400 years ago where razing cities and mass murders were a normal way of conducting warfare rather than a war crime against international law
Germans so apologetic about WW2 that they get a pass for committing genocide in their African colonies a few decades earlier
The history curriculum in England actually compares him to Hitler for his actions in Ireland
Funnily enough Ian Paisley is not representative of the British opinion whatsoever, unless you think we’re all raging anti-Catholic “no surrender” types
Everything you said above is easily reversible following the same simple formula:
Irish: Vague moral platitudes using modern moral standards applied to far history while simultaneously hypocritically supporting evil actions taken in the modern day
English: Nuanced point on above historical reference using one sided justification
Protip: act like a victim, be treated as a victim
Of course it does
It's written by far left revisionist teachers
Cromwell was an evil bastard
I'm not debating that
The moral standards applied to him in the modern era should acknowledge say, the 30 years war, which raged on in Europe at similar time and where 'genocide' type actions like those taken by Cromwell were almost normal
I'm not saying he wasn't a nasty fucker and what he done was justified, I'm saying the very specific hurrah Irish people make about their victimhood in this regard when such actions were taking place semi commonly at the time is a little self indulgent (particularly when they're used to justify the IRA killing kids in England via "Muh 800 years")
> Have thought about invading France and shipping the French to the Falklands as cheap (free) labour on the rock farm's there
Not a day goes by without me having this thought
Loads of random shit was talked about in regards to "solving" Northern Ireland including relocating Hong Kongers (they also considered Scotland) so I wouldn't put too much weight into it
I think it would be right to acknowledge that there's a wide variety of opinions of him ranging from "Who
", "Dictator" and "Republican". It would be unfair to say he's loved though, I think for a lot of us here he's just another historical figure who did some good and some bad
The distance between now and him is almost equal to the distance between him and Genghis Khan, it would seem to be a waste of energy to seriously criticise him or be upset by his actions
As an English speaker with essentially no knowledge of any other Germanic languages, I understood very very little
With the Scandinavian ones I could only pick out occasional words like *konstruksjonen*; I couldn't get any actual meaning from them really
The German one I got literally nothing
The Dutch one was the best for me; I could get little snippets here and there
Still not enough to get the whole meaning (or even the gist of it really) but it definitely felt the most similar
Edit: Just seen you added some more
It's the same story with Low German, Bavarian, Luxembourgish and Icelandic: I understood next to nothing, but the Afrikaans one was actually pretty good in comparison
I could even understand some full sentences like "Suid-Afrika is een van die mees etnies diverse lande in Afrika
Die land het meer Europese immigrante ontvang as enige ander land in Afrika".
Could barely understand any of it but Dutch was closest
One thing I've noticed about Dutch is that Dutch sounds like English but it doesn't make sense
This is what I hear
I can pick up a couple of words on the Dutch one
Maybe 10% at most
It's like reading Old English
That's definitely better than the castle page
I still can't understand most of it though
I think all the names helped a lot as well (cities, islands, overseas territories etc
) Without things like that to give a rough guide on the topic I think I would've got even less
My understanding of these two is going to be tainted by the fact that I actually do speak some French and I did study Spanish for a couple of years back in school (even though I can remember next to none of it, the exposure is there and obviously the similarity to French will help as well)
I could get the gist of both the articles to be honest
I really wasn't expecting to understand so much of the Spanish one
That came as quite a surprise to me
Someone with no prior experience with Romance languages (like me with other Germanic ones) might not understand so much however
Ah so the Dutch is actually very similar
The only thing I didn't understand was the *ontvang/ontvangen*. So I just kind of ignored it
My word-for-word understanding was:
South Africa is one of the most ethnic diverse lands(=countries
) in Africa
The land(=country) has/had more European immigrants ??? as(=than
) any other land(=country) in Africa
I'd love to find some more example like this where they're so similar to understand
It's pretty fun haha
Same
Some make more sense depending on the context
E.g. "met ongeveer 63,7 miljoen inwoners". I knew what this meant but didn't know how to translate "ongeveer" and "inwoners". But then I saw the breakdown on a constituent country basis, "Engeland in het zuiden (53
012
456 inwoners)" and I realised that "inwoners" means "inhabitants".
I agree
Plus *Vem* looks pretty similar to *whom* in English as well
So really it's just German being awkward here haha
Not really
I certainly have some clothes that are comfier than others and I wear them more often at home but I still do wear them out
The only clothes I have that I would never wear outside the house are some old worn clothes that I might wear if I was painting the fence or something so as not to ruin my proper clothes
Our national anthem actually has a verse about 'rebellious Scots to crush' I believe
Its just a shit national anthem all round and should be replaced with Jerusalem (nice and short) or Land of Hope and Glory
Also one of our favourite Christmas songs has the phrase 'cheap, lousy fa _ _ ot' in it
[ \- 'Roast Beef of Old England" says England beat France in Wars because we have better food
[ \- Two world wars and one world cup (Anti Germany football chant)
[ \- The National Anthem including the deleted verse about crushing rebellious Scots
[ Every song written by Northern Irish Unionists, but particularly '50p flute', which contains the chorus "fuck the Pope and the IRA
10 German Bombers, caused a storm when England fans sung it in Dortmund a few years back
Plus, before the 2006 WC our FA warned fans not to sing it, they did anyway ofc
Maybe I’m of a different time, but at school we used to sing that and Hitler’s only got one ball on the playground
To me it’s just a silly school song
In reference to OP, we have our own slew of anti-Irish ones
Including ‘no surrender to the IRA’, ‘fuck the IRA’, ‘fuck the Pope’ etc
Thankfully when we played each other a few years back in Dublin, we behaved
Although when England played Scotland at Celtic Park it was a different matter
Personally I find England fans who act like Rangers fans abroad as just embarrassing
Why you singing about the Pope in fucking 2019
As an English raised Catholic I just find the situation bemusing
I can appreciate the Black and Tans one, because they were bastards and deserved it
But it was slightly jarring walking to a music festival in the summer and a group of Irish lads were chanting ‘fuck your Union Jack, we want our country back’. Not necessarily offensive, but why you singing that at a fucking musical festival ?
"Rule Britannia" is pretty damn nationalistic, though I'm not sure if anyone would actually get offended by it
Every other comment about their mildly racist songs: How quaint and harmless
German  comment about mildly racist song: **Concern**
The verse is an alternative verse that was created during the Jacobite Rebellion and the song itself become widely popular as a result; the original song was created further back though we don't know when
I think we should keep it as the UK anthem but instate Jerusalem as the English anthem
I heard 50p flute in Sunderland as an anti geordie song
The last line was 'Fuck the Toon and the Toon Army'
That line hasn’t been a part of the anthem for centuries
It was added in by an anti-Jacobite
cheers u/thecockmeister
They have a Simply the Best knock-off which is hideous but 50p flute is a banger (and my family are Catholics so I probably shouldn't think that )
The flute one is class to be fair
I wouldn't be surprised if they got that from Rangers fans tbh
A line added due to anti-Jacobite sentiment centuries ago and has never been officially used, or widely used at all since the 19th century
I get your point but it’s not quite the same
Still are
They sure are a contentious people
Our anti french songs are much better, because they annoy the French not only in terms of talking about beating you in wars, but uses your own insult about English food to claim that English food is better than French food
"When mighty Roast Beef was the Englishman's food,
It ennobled our brains and enriched our blood
Our soldiers were brave and our courtiers were good
the Roast Beef of old England, And old English Roast
Beef
But since we have learnt from all-vapouring France
To eat their ragouts as well as to dance,
We're fed up with nothing but vain complaisance
the Roast Beef of Old England, And old English Roast Beef
Tbf Put Em Under Pressure isn't terrible either
Nonsense we never did anything wrong, now watch this gently amusing Hugh Grant movie while we play with these maps over here
My first HOI4 game was Portugal because I knew that they were neutral in the Second World War so it would give me a chance to learn the game before being bumfucked by the Axis
My first CK2 game was as Mumu in Ireland as it came highly recommended to new players
My first EU4 game was as England because I knew it had a mission to force a personal union with France *and I simply couldn’t resist subjugating the French*.
I only play CK2 and I'm still pretty much a novice I would say
My only strategy is 'keep my head down and develop internally'. I'm not very good at invasions, so I prefer to expand through scheming and marriages
So far, I've found the Leon tutorial and the French duchies (Champagne specifically) the easiest because their medium size makes them more manageable than the larger states, but they're still just big enough to make an invasion logistically difficult for the AI to pursue
I only play EUIV
Mostly choose small countries with big potential and I also hate blobbing unless I'm playing a country that historically blobbed e.g. Muscovy
I also like to colonise
Fave countries are Florence, Milan, Holland, Portugal, Sweden, Muscovy, England
That's probably in order as well
From the UK: well I know that in Wales, there is llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch and I think it's the longest in Europe
I could be wrong tho
Liverpool
I was planning a roadtrip to Scotland in May, first stop on the way there from the South West is Liverpool and I will definitely be going as soon as bars, hotels and most importantly, Scotland allows me to come
I'm moving to Liverpool in September, if that counts
We'd been planning a family holiday to the Harz mountains, probably Wernigerode, for this summer
So probably that
Will travelling be as free and easy as before
We tend to travel by train if it's possible, so that part shouldn't change, but what changes a hard no-deal Brexit will bring in January, who knows
Bruges
Its really pretty and quite easy to get to from England
Hope you have a great time here
Up the villa
Unfortunately our roadtrip is quite squeezed to Friday to Friday so we were planning having Friday day and night there and then all of Sat and off toward Scotland Sunday morning
I’ve got lots planned
I’ve only been up North twice before and i’ve heard a lot of good things about Liverpool so i’m pretty excited
Let me know if you have any recommendations
Thanks for the warning
Planning to come up on a Friday so hopefully it won’t be too bad
But sure i’ll hit some traffic as will be coming from Somerset
Cannot wait
When I was in Switzerland I visited this town called Gstaad just because I had seen photos of it and it looked nice (as most places do in Switzerland) I didn't know it was an upscale resort town for a lot of celebrities and royalty
It's a tiny town and all the shops were like Prada and Louis Vuitton haha Although the only thing I saw that was noteworthy was what looked like a lost dog
In rugby I do
If England are out, I'll support any Northern Hemisphere team to win it
In football it's different
A) Because the rivalries are a lot more heated B) Our neighbours don't always qualify for major tournaments
For example in the 2016 Euros, I didn't support Wales when England got knocked out
Mainly because it hurt they got further than us, but also because their team and fans celebrated so much when we lost
I don't blame them ofc, that's what Football is all about
Similarly, I hope Scotland don't qualify for Euro 2020
I did cheer on Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland though
Scotland, Wales and NI
Ireland a bit as well
I used to until I saw England play when I was in a pub in Wales and realised the vitriol they had
Was told it's the same in Scotland
Not any more
>Wales
>Ireland
>NI
>Scotland
In the 2020 euros it's going to be Finland because
I support the underdog
I'll cheer for the team/country I like the best still in the tournament
Doesn't have to be a neighbour
Yes but of course not as strongly as I would support England
I generally go for the underdogs, but I also will go for anyone with Arsenal players playing for them
Also anybody playing against Wales/Scotland/Northern Ireland
Heartbroken
fine then, be that way
>Anyone playing against England
Not fair, you lot never qualify for anything so we don't get to do the same to you :(
Ah yes, the famous England Spain football rivalry
cheers
just disappointed
Can’t have watched us recently then
The sheer amount of McDonalds in Italy
For a nation that’s so renowned for it’s food it was shocking to see how many Golden Arches there are in Rome and Florence
There’s a McDonalds inside the train station in Florence, then another two within direct eyesight as soon as you exit
Crazy
>Portugal
I lived in lisbon for a while and the thing that surprised me most was how immature the men were
A lot of them were quite disgusting to women and they seemed really chauvinistic and old fashioned
Ive never lived in Portugal, but I've had a few holidays there, and it's the worst country I've been to in terms of there being constant low level sexual harassment
I’ve heard the stereotype about us having carpet in our bathrooms
my grandma had carpet in her downstairs toilet but other than that I’ve never seen it in any house I’ve ever been in in the UK
> **England (a small West Midlands university town)**   : people drinking in Saturday morning
Super weird
People thinking that "having fun" = "drink so much that you vomit on the street and then pee or poop in the bushes". And not only silly students, but 50 year old guys
drinking culture is one thing, making yourself like this is another
Sounds like Leam
There are pubs and then there are pubs
The trick is knowing the difference between the two
My home town is pretty rural at 90k people
I can walk 20 mins in one direction and see nothing but hills and fields and 25 mins in the other and be in the town centre
It's when you hit someone in the face with a glass
Monaco: Rich
Liechtenstein: Tiny German place
Vatican City: Pope
Andorra: Skiing
Luxembourg: EU and rich
San Marino: I know it's in Italy
that's it
>the hilarious story of 80 soldiers that they sent to the Austro-Prussian war and were back with 81 lol
I would love to hear this story
A wee state
Sorry, would you prefer little state
The WW3 "Hype" is ridiculous, nobody is going to launch Nukes over Iran
That being said, asymmetric responses are definitely going to happen, and we'll probably see some attacks on US personnel worldwide
>US trying to force a war to the limit
Always good to be reelected as President
Lyndon B Johnson (Vietnam president) lost his bid for reelection, hell, he lost in the primaries before election season even properly began
There is no recurring pattern of wars reelecting presidents, thankfully
Iran has it's own interests in Iraq
Like the other user mentioned, you cant "clean up" Iraq without getting involved with Iran
It's like trying to involve yourself in Canada without the USA getting involved
>This is exactly the reason why we're out of NATO,
Well, Finlandization might be part of it too
The issue for healthcare in the US isnt money
The USA's federal budget for Medicare and Medicaid is already *way* bigger than their military budget
>Medicare spending grew 6
4% to **$750
2 billion** in 2018, or 21% of total NHE, while Medicaid spending grew 3
0% to **$597
4 billion** in 2018, or 16% of total NHE
Combined, the two surpass a trillion USD and are bigger than the Military budget by hundreds of billions of US dollars
The American government needs to reform how healthcare related products are priced in its country, and probably revamp Medicaid and Medicare (programs started in the 1960s) entirely, simply throwing more money at the problem will accomplish nothing for them
>oil prices going up again, congrats US

Trump was a Green Crusader all along
Why would they reinstate conscription
Has everyone forgotten about Vietnam
Conscripts get angry and murder their officers, volunteers are disciplined and obey their orders
The US government wont conscript anyone, because conscription is what triggers mass protests and unrest in the country
With the current setup, professional soldiers are living in a different world from the civilians
When they die, only a small bit of the population feel it, and the rest of the country doesnt notice it or care much
>fascist lies
Fucks sake people, not everything is Fascism
Wasnt Nixon re-elected on the promise to *end* the american role in the Vietnam war (Kissinger's role in the Paris peace talks aside)
Scotland
Hopefully an EU army
i’d happily be a collaborator at this point
Probably Russia if we don't stop being so aggressive towards them
Bloody Fritz…
England doesn't get invaded
We invade other people
Probably would assume France though, because Germany don't have much of a military, and they are desperate to steal the recipes for our food, want to drink our English Sparkling Wine,  and they are jealous because Cheddar is the best cheese in the world
We're more likely going to have Civil Tuting wars over brexit at the moment, but maybe when the money runs out
How would England invade on our own
it would be the UK
Not Azerbaijan
Instructions unclear, got invaded by Moldova
Besides, France are really bad at fighting England, you couldn't even kill Sean Bean and he dies in everything he has ever been in
>England
Not the UK
Just,
KING GEORGE COMMANDS AND WE OBEY
Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain
It's too late, we've just put our towel on the Bundestag sunbeds, we own Germany now
Lincolnshire Sausages and Carling all round
Maybe you come here and go all berserker when you see how no one respects the bike lanes
'Brother'
\*recalls Marshal Wade\*
We could solve the Ukraine/Russia problem by retaking Sevastopol
I think Crimea would be a great Overseas British Territory holiday resort after Brexit, all the Spanish users on here will tell you how great Brits on holiday are for a place
Maybe you could go all Mad Max and add spikes to your bikes
Irelands our backdoor back in
ffs have to invade Portugal, Spain and Belgium to deal with France again then
France are not that scary, they couldn't even kill Sean Bean ffs
Crimea is as British as Sobraine Cigarettes (they are being sold in Ukraine as 'Sobraine London' now
Nah, heard he's going to become Singapore-on-Thames, will probably trade them in for a younger Thai wife
Yes, we have 'greasy spoon' cafes (actually places to get food, they might sell coffee but it's always the instant stuff) in most neighbourhoods and on major road routes
They typically will do an English Breakfast all day, and some other traditional British foods (but never fish and chips), for example Sheppard's Pie or Cottage Pie (neither of which are actually pies, they are meat with potatoes on top)
They are mostly just for breakfast and lunch tho
>in the original English version he has a "northern"? English accent
Brits plz correct me
He be from the West Country
Pretty much nailed it then
The stereotypical pirate accent is West country, Blackbeard was a Bristolian so I'm guessing that's why Robert Newton adopted it in the film Treasure Island (which is where we get the 'pirate accent' from)
In Primary school we had backpacks but did have ‘trays’ or ‘drawers’ which we could use, i think for our books
In secondary we just had backbacks, our text books generally stayed in the class rooms
Think we took home our exercise books though that we worked in
In college there were lockers which you could rent for a £5 refundable deposit but i didn’t bother
Yes but nobody uses them past year 7 (the first year of secondary school, aged 11-16)
Everyone I know just stopped using them entirely aged like 12, some people may use them to store weed / pe bags but everyone carries around the books in a backpack / a lot of girls use handbags
in primary (4-11) we had some ‘pigeon holes’ at the end but most schools just cba with them
We had lockers in year 7 (age 11-12) it was the first year of going to "big" school
It was quite a weird thing to have I think, meant mainly for PE kits but I don't think many people actually used them
I don't know any other schools in my area that had them so I think we were a bit weird for having them
Yes, only in secondary schools but we dont tend to use them that much
(Its mainly the year sevens
) And atleast in mine, you have to pay
The thing is that at my school you didn't really end up having to carry around that many books
Most textbooks we're communal and kept in that subjects classroom and were handed out when they were to be used
So there were no heavy textbooks to carry
We had small workbooks to write in but as I say they were small and you'd only have to take the ones for the lessons you had that day
And quite often the teacher would take them in to mark them
However I did find that when I was at college (age 16 - 18) I had to do lots of revision so ended up carrying around huge binders of notes and my own personal textbooks to use for revision
I also took my laptop
I feel I may have permanently stunted my growth from carrying around a 10kg bag every day lol
That's the same with my school
And as an excited year 7 I got one
Never used it, so let a mate borrow it
They lost BOTH KEYS (they were both on the same Keyring but they said they took it off, and then 'their siblings lost them both') Endless to say, I don't trust them anymore, and I dont trust no one anymore
And I still dont have a locker because it was a waste of money
Another short story is my sister's got broken into, and they broke the lock which was a Primark Hedwig one so she was heart broken
Luckily she had like nothing in it
Edit: I think I should add: The school doesn't supply us with a lock or key, we had to buy them ourselves
I also had to leave the lock on it, as I had no key which must have bugged the school as they had to break the lock to free the locker lol
Yeah growing up in the 90s for me a billion meant 'a million millions' but by 2000 that had changed to a billion being 'a thousand millions'
> no one knows or uses that system anymore
Not entirely true
That was the system I (21) first learnt at home from my parents
Of course, I wouldn't *use* it now but I wouldn't be surprised if there were other cases of it being informally passed down outside of school
The sun never setting…god couldn't trust us in the dark
Far right racist nationalists, alcoholism, chavs and the stupid things people from my country do abroad
To all of Europe, on behalf of England, I deeply apologise
Baked bean consumption
90% of the Netherlands claim to be able to speak English
The sun never sets on the empire
Because we can't be trusted in the dark…
Brexit, gladly
Scotland does have a weird accent but I wouldn’t call it German
if you could ask people who know about the music "which nation has had the biggest contribution to electronic music
" it would be, without a doubt, the UK
however, as per the examples people are giving, we don't really provide the huge names - probably something to do with our scenes not wanting to support those who try to repackage our culture for the masses
The problem is you tried to do it in Europe
don’t shit where you eat said the french and British
Yes, we are lucky
Can confirm
Have captured 13 German beach towel deckchairs this morning
definitely stretching the term "culture" with those artists as well
We're more known for jungle and garage also
Finders keepers
True but it always goes wrong in Europe eventually
Most people would, or more usually a less formal 'cheers' or 'ta'.
Up North, it's unusual if you dont say 'Cheers mate' or something along those lines
It's the norm in Yorkshire but I always procrastinate saying it and then I'm already off the bus and I haven't said it and now I feel like a dickhead for not saying thanks
I'm a very anxious person
>yelling
Hardly yelling lol, just saying a normal speaking volume while getting off
Right, I see lol
All the busses I have been on you walk right by the driver and the driver can easily hear you
As we established later on, we have different styles of bus
In all busses I have been on you walk straight past the driver who could easily hear
London buses however you exit from the side or back
The only way I have ever even bought a ticket for a bus is by directly buying it off the driver
Riot Games is also refusing to acknowledge Hong Kong, referring to a LoL team called "Hong Kong Attitude" as only "HKA" but they've avoided most of the controversy because they've made no big moves regarding the drama
EPIC or rather Tim Sweeney, on the other hand, have publicly stated that they will support free speech, including those criticising China despite being 40% owned by Tencent
It's quite sad, I think I wont be spending any money on Activision or Blizzard any time soon now
I support HK, but this seems like a typical reddit Echo chamber drama
As much as I believe Blizzard are in the wrong, I do not wish to get involved here
Blizzard, or indeed any company, should not censor people based on viewpoints aslong as it isn't extreme/racist/Fascist
This goes both ways, for example do you think there would be as much backlash if Blizzard banned someone for supporting China
Reddit loves to do stuff like this, they make some massive echo chamber about how evil a company/person is, and barely even make any difference
Admittedly a gaming company would be affected much more than say Nestlé or the Chinese government, but the point still stands
So irl I stand with HK, I have protested with thousands of others here who view the protesters and what they stand for as an inspiration, but it is important that we actually do something and not just create a huge echo chamber over it
Oh yeah I completely agree that they overreacted, no idea why they were so harsh, but I guess they really want the lucrative Chinese Market
Definitely uncalled for
China may soon be the world's largest superpower
It has a strong Economy, Influential politians and a huge profesional military
They can spread there power in many ways
Many countries are dependant on China, the Chinese not only manufacture a great amount of products, but also invest in most countries, I went to a brilliant lecture about this
The Chinese have investment banks across the globe, and a good amount of the global economy is supported by them
China will be a superpower, and it won't just be a cold war situation again
Unlike the 20th century the entire world is interdependent, it won't be a bipolar world
Have to be honest, Myanmar’s borders look cool
The island of Great Britain does look like a dragon kneeling down begging to be fed
Uzbekistan challenges you to a boot fight
Oh yeah i never saw it before lol
It's bad
It's not Turkey's place to do this
It's upsetting and infuriating
This is not at all acceptable
>Couple that with the fact that the US is basically pulling back our forces and our interests from the region, and Europe's inability to actually accomplish much of anything in the Med without the US being there, and that would mean that most of the Eastern Med would be solidly under the control of Russia and Turkey
Solidly is not accurate, Russia isn't in a position to beat the UK Royal Navy, or the French Navy, but the position of Turkey is certainly key to ensuring Russia currently has minimal influence in that region, the UK also has sovereign airbase areas in Cyprus so has much better air coverage than Russia would, but it would still become a huge headache, and would make Gibraltar even more important strategically to restrict access to the English channel and Atlantic
Firstly, you are hypocrites for supporting Northern Cyprus and then claiming 'territorial integrity' means the Kurds cannot leave Turkey
I've been to Mardin personally, Diyarbakir too, these are not Turkish cities and the people there mostly hate Turkey,
&#x200B;
But anyway there's no such thing as 'territorial integrity' or constitutions granting you the right to land, there are only things countries can do, and things countries cannot do
For example, if Turkey wanted to invade the Republic of Cyprus, they could beat the Cypriot Military for sure, and the Greek military too if they helped, and ignoring the fact you'd be attacking a UN peacekeeping mission, which would get you condemned and under sanctions, even if the UN were not there, you couldn't actually do it, because the UK claims airbases there are sovereign territory, and therefore you'd end up getting destroyed
The point I'm making is that the Turkish constitution doesn't matter, the reason the Kurds can't have a state is that the Turkish army would destroy them if they tried
Ive three questions
To any a non-native English speakers reading:
What did the English language sound like to you before you learned English
And also what does English sound like to your non-native ears
, is it a harsh or soft sounding language and when an English speakers speaks what do they sound like
, And in general what sounds/noises do you associate with English
What did the various English accents(English/Welsh/Irish/Scottish/American/Canadian/Australian/New Zealand) etc sound like to you before you learned English
, Could you differentiate them
And lastly does English sound like a Germanic language to your ears
That and Scandi's. Swedes have impeccable English
It still pretty much is for me too
Its really expensive so many other european countries often come up first by default i think
We say "pop your clogs" in english
lol neeeerds
Essex, they're like the Florida of England
I hear you, but I'd submit Northern Ireland as being "odd one out" as well
Literally, in that it's the only bit not on the island of Great Britain, but also its complex political situation makes it a special case in just about every way
Its nice to know it’s not just us who struggle
I'd say Essex is more like the stereotype of New Jersey rather than Florida
Yeah, when people not from the South talk about "the South" what they mean is "London and the home counties" and not regions like the West Country, East Anglia or the Midlands
Agreed
What would you say should be Florida, perhaps Newcastle
As much as it shames me to admit it, I kinda wanna say my own county of Norfolk
Both swampy and coastal, both sort of out on their own away from the rest of the country, both renowned for being full of weirdos (think Florida Man and Normal for Norfolk), both places old people retire to, plus having grown up there I can safely say that people here like ketamine just as much as Floridians like meth
You'd literally give your country up to another nation
Same, as someone from Norfolk which is basically as rural as it gets
Like I'm fairly sure Norwich's tallest building is still the Cathedral and that's from the Middle Ages
To be honest, I only really count Suffolk and Norfolk as being proper East Anglia, don't think about Bedford at all
I lived in Oberwart for a year back in 1999-2000 - fascinating little place
I didn't recall it having an official romani name at the time, but there had been an anti-romani bombing there in recent years, so maybe that drew a bit more attention to things
But there is 0 chance a majority of people in Orkney and Shetland want to be Norwegian
They're Scots
Scots with a Nordic heritage, but Scots nonetheless
For me, it is british drill music
It’s like an evolved version of grime and garage but it’s honestly awful
It’s basically the music that the gangs make
No the worst in Norway is all that "kebabnorsk" music where they sing absolutely terribly and teenagers think it's cool but it's rubbish
And russemusikk
Sucks
Ah yes it still gives me shivers
It’s called “God Save The Queen”, and I’m an atheist and a republican
So yeah
I don’t really vibe with it
200,000
Wow
I don't feel like I've been here that long in the scheme of things but it's quintupled in that time
That is a lot
I hope the friendly small community feel can be kept at this fast growth pace
That's really what drew me to this sub
I suppose that makes us joining buddies :)
And talking of that, this has made me go reading through a bunch of my early comments and I did notice your name popping up in the same places a bit haha
> In my view, losing that would mean losing an essential part of the subreddit itself
I completely agree
And as far as I can tell you and the rest of the mod team seem to be doing your best at trying to retain this, so my thanks to you guys for that
Let's hope it can last for as long as possible
At least 5
In a normal supermarket, around 8 maybe
Options for local Sainsburys are;
Royal Gala
Braeburn
Pink Lady
Granny Smith
Jazz
Golden Delicious
'mini apples'
Kanzi
You also get most of those in an organic option
The only thing I have against those cups is they are too big
I always end up making like a pint of coffee
Where do you live that you don’t know what sports direct is
You can buy them at the shops if you like
They are just a brand tie-in rather than being sport related, and they're huge (1 pint or 568ml)
French people referring to themselves "as a French" isn't really 'correct' English but I suppose if enough of them keep doing it it will become correct
The 'proper' way is "as a Frenchman" or "as a Frenchwoman".
I have a trick to tell the difference between British fans and foreign fans on [r/soccer] even if they have a flair of an English club
Non-native speakers and americans will say "Liverpool **is** a football club" whereas we don't say that in the UK
It looks really jarring
We say "Liverpool **are** a football club". That's because in American English collective nouns use *is* whereas in British English collective nouns are referred to with *are
* I think what is happening is that non-native speakers are applying their own grammar rules to English or are just speaking American English
"how do you call it"
I see this with Chinese people more than anything
On any video related to Chinese politics or culture, half of the comments start with "I am a Chinese and
"Liverpool is a football club" is fine, but "Liverpool is 1-0 up" isn't.
The first is a singular entity, the latter a collection of people on a pitch, if that makes sense
Whereas "Oasis is a band" sounds OK but "The Beatles is a band" is weird because of the grammatical agreement
I try to use semicolons wherever possible; they look so much more sophisticated
Unless we're quids in of course
I'm not sure what they say in London but in West Yorkshire saying you're going to the seaside for your holidays makes perfect sense, I would probably say beach but many people use them interchangeably and nobody would misunderstand them
If you say whom you're a nonce
You gotcha
"The government are planning a new scheme" etc
You *can* do that in English if you try
You *shouldn't*, but you can
A lot of Indian standard English is very Victorian, presumably dating back to the Raj
While English in native-speaking countries has changed over the last century or so, English is basically no-one's first language in India and is solely taught as a lingua franca
So all thaf rather antiquated phrasing is just passed down from generation to generation, filtered through all the stuff in this thread about non-native speakers not *quite* getting it right
Because in example 1 and 3, "50-dollar" is being used as an adjective and should really be hyphenated
It's basically the point
It's supposed to be confrontational
it's you
Dont forget that many of these MPs are drunk outta their minds or at least well tipsy & buzzed as they're sat there because they have an open bar(payed for by the taxpayer i might add) where they can drink the finest booze all day for free(the same applies to their food too
Its all subsidized by the taxpayer, smh :/. They should get rid of the free booze and food, in no other line of work are you allowed to drink on the job or do you get free food) etc
but regarding the uncivilized nature
Its not helped by the fact that many MPs are clearly heavy drinkers and they get tanked up before entering the chamber for these big events, and alcohol is famous for lowering inhabitions
Hence the behaviour one sees on tv
Tbh it all just comes across as so childish and immature, all the jeering and infantile bantering, i mean if you behaved as these MPs in parliment do, behaved like that at your work or in school you'd be punished for it, yet our representitives in the highest offices of the land etc see nothing wrong in behaving like a bunch of drunkards and toddlers essentially
Its a joke tbh, shows how outta touch these elites are
Probably reminds them of their time at boarding school, its all a little fun game to them, when its real people's lives they have in their hands but they dont see it that way, smh :/ not to mention all the archaic procedures etc
The whole thing needs to be binned and reformed, rebooted from the ground up
Its the 21st century ffs
What was a Level 80 Daedric mace doing in the middle of the house﻿??, You cant blame the guy for wanting that sweet loot for himself
Just think of them OP stats
I think it's definitely a contributing factor
We don't have a great history of referendums and we don't have a developed culture or institutions around them like Switzerland
Have sex but make love :)

Mostly as a pin to wear around this time of year
But poppy seed bagels are fabulous
Iv seen that  doc
Yes but is quite a process
Also Belgium and France use it i believe but different colours
Im not 100% certian myself
Iv looked it up in the past but i cant remember
Theres ways to make opium tea by boiling them and if you score the seed pods and dry the gunk that oozes out you can make that into opium but its not that simple
Theres a sub called r/druggardening that could help also google is your friend
The poppy was the first thing to grow back in bomb craters which is why it was chosen as a symbol of hope and rememberance
I’d remove the troubles of Ireland
It was a complete mess and the IRAs bombings in London affected a lot of people I know
I think either the battle of Hastings, not taxing the 13 colonies and decolonising earlier
Why would you want to establish colonies in North America
Couldn't agree more, I'd say the Troubles also
Ww1 was happening anyway
The only way we would've avoided war is if germany didn't go through Belgium who I think we had a defensive pact with
There was quite a few
An underground station and dozens of buildings
The horse guards were also targeted with a nail bomb
Killed the queens horses
There are photographs but it’s sickening to see
Yeah and colonialism is bad
Ireland was colonised by Britain
They did know that if they entered Belgian territory they would be at war, I believe that we sent a warning after they declared war with Serbia which brought russia and France into the war
I guess that Belgium was more important and strategic than denmark
It was all a fucking mess
I’m sure the kid wasn’t the intended target but that’s just horrible
Conflict in urban areas always has innocent casualties
Belfast got hit really hard by terrorism :/
Right
but I’m sure we can all figure out where that leads
Why would an Irish person advocate colonisation given how much Ireland has suffered because of it
My stepmother as a child (is English but had family in Ireland) had a gun put to her head because she had an English accent
There was a lot of hate in people at the time and it’s still getting dragged into modern politics
It’s disgraceful
I’m from the opposite of the whole mess
A Protestant raised English lad
I’m for Irish independence but I think the British should have been a lot harder on the IRA
They became a terrorism group and should have been treated more like one
And a lot of people ignore the terrorism and it’s just sad
I know a few ex soldiers who went to Ireland who have ptsd from what they had to deal with
People forget half the history because it doesn’t suit their perfect vision of history
Because people ably see it from their side
The IRA were terrorists
The British treated Ireland badly
Ireland had issues because or religious bullshit
Britain had issues too
It would take too long to write out all of the context to the troubles as it was the build up of centuries of mistakes and atrocity on both sides
Goodnight mate
Sleep well
> **No, we don't walk on the left or the right
We are British and wander where we will**
> The British have little sense of pavement etiquette, preferring a slalom approach to pedestrian progress
When two strangers approach each other, it often results in the performance of a little gavotte as they double-guess in which direction the other will turn
At my school we're just a horde walking wherever in the hallways
There’s a rule in my school where you have to keep on the left when walking down a hallway
I think we do
To me, walking on the right hand side seems really unnatural and in most cases I think people walk broadly on the left although it isn't that ordered
Or when people won’t walk single file on a pavement next to a busy road
At high school it was like that but at sixth form we all walk on the left
That is unless it's really really busy
It is mostly viewed, alongside the Potsdam Conference, as setting the  stage for the Cold War and creating a commitment to prevent the expansion of communism around the world
Stalin took Romania and bounced on Churchill’s belly
Not striking a deal would have endangered countries like Greece however, the communists there were agitating for control
It was also Churchill who made sure Poland got compensated with German territory for the territory taken by the USSR directly
I’d like to copy the quality of being a country that people want to copy from
The cycling infrastructure of the Netherlands, please
I’d love lots more regional languages
The only other language that exists in England is the rarely spoken Cornish
I would absolutely adore a Yorkshire language
If that’s not possible, at least adopt more official languages (Welsh etc), it would give me a lot more motivation to learn a new language and would help in choosing it
The EU like most of europe
the Alps please
I like British food but honestly I’ve had some really nice stuff from foreign countries that they don’t do around here for whatever reason
Also better weather
(To be fair though today is actually quite nice)
pick the Brandenburg Airport in Berlin or the north-south metro in Amsterdam
Bucharest metro is pretty awesome
I haven't been on any other Romanain trains however, so this is probably a massively biased outlook
The tube is also amazing, but when you compare it to the likes of northernrail things start looking bleak
I assume the Basque flair is currently in jail
10/10 trolling
Ps British food is unironically not that bad
Can you only get a state pension in Greece
Are there no pension options available privately
In the UK you’re automatically enrolled in a pension at your job ( you can leave it if you want) which takes 6% of your salary and isn’t taxed
The company you work for also has to pay in the same amount
You’re also allowed to access it once you turn 55 I think
The state pension is then given to once you hit 65, soon to be 66
Although fuck knows what it’ll be when I’m older
Probably 70+.
Please expand
It's also the quality of it that makes a big difference with British food tbh, because you can make it with very cheap ingredients if you want, it just won't be as good
Even I wouldn't eat some of the concoctions that claim to be Cheddar in Europe
They use the term mean that rubber American style stuff
Dutch food or German food
After all, we did invent chips
How as it
British food has a wider variety of sauces with your potatoes and meat than German food, like we have curry sauces even in fish and chip shops
Also, we have English breakfasts, and they do not
That’s super cool
Lmao, is the British way
Don’t fix our own problems, just fuck over our enemies way more so they have to give in to our demands or needs one way or another
Mate you can't forget unicum
I am a native English speaker, and the people who have told me how easy English is do come across as arrogant
English is not the hardest language, but even small changes in the phrasing of a sentence can make the meaning completely different - ‘pissed’ vs ‘pissed off’ in British English
Phrasal verbs always seem to present a problem as well and can again change the meaning if the whole verb is not used
Advantages of English:
Very little to learn by way of genders of objects
Verb conjugation quite easy/
Grammatical cases have almost disappeared /
Shares words with many European languages as has Germanic and Romance influences/
No tones/
No mutations as in Celtic languages
Neutral:
There are more verb tenses than German, fewer verb tenses than Spanish
Disadvantages:
No consistency in orthography/
I think it is difficult to get the correct intonation and the language relies a lot on stress to communicate meaning/
Exact meaning of words can vary between dialects of English/
Pluricentric language, so no ‘correct’ way to learn English, no centralised body for spelling and grammar/
Need to appreciate the different ‘registers’ of English and when certain terms are appropriate/
Appreciation of cultural differences between different English-speaking countries (e.g. ‘liberal’ could be interpreted very differently in different countries’ and have almost the opposite meaning)
‘World English’ misses out a lot of the slang, nuance, colloquial language, idioms, etc
of English
English TV, computer games, etc
are everywhere, so learning material is very accessible, which can’t be said for a lot of languages
There is also a large pool of people to speak with
I’m a native English speaker and I feel bad for people who have to learn English because of our weird sound rules
I talked to my language teacher about it in school one time
I only speak english
I live there and always have lived there
I think the hardest thing about it is the ammount of exceptions and how so many sounds and letters dont follow the rules you are taught
God, as an actual English person I don’t know whether to be impressed or depressed that everyone seems to find English so easy
Dutch is very similar to English I've heard
I've only ever learned french and german and by far german is easier because it is germanic
I know more french though because I started learning it earlier
True
How hard your language is to learn totally depends on the native language of the person trying to learn it
In general, people who speak germanic languages will find it easier to learn germanic languages and the same is true for other language families
There are lots of English words that don’t make it to an official dictionary
That’s why we have urbandictionary :)
And you can practise your english in neighbouring countries
Scandinavia are always fond of speaking english
‘Quite simple’, but then your post has mistakes in it
This is exactly my point
German is harder than English
Albanian isn’t related to anything else, therefore it is harder as there are fewer conjugates with other languages to rely on
Most likely, your first language is German or Albanian, so they would obviously be easy for you
‘childlike’ : (
Jesus
Because Dutch is one of the closest languages to English
Not much of a surprise then that native Dutch speakers would find it easy
Unsurprisingly it is mainly speakers of Scandinavian languages and Dutch that find English easiest - if you google ‘map of Europe by lexical distances’, it is obvious why - the lexical distance between those languages is shortest
This had me
If you want
‘Well’ needs a comma after it /
‘decently German’ needs the order of the sentence changing, so ‘German decently’ /
‘The English grammar’ sounds awkward, surely just ‘English grammar’ /
‘Literal hell’. - ‘literally’ has now entered the dictionary as a word that adds emphasis, but if you read it using its traditional meaning, it does sound funny
I assume you didn’t actually have to go to Hell to learn German
‘Quite’ also means something different in the UK/USA, so I assume you mean the British version (obviously I am inclined to read it this way as I am British) /
While vs whereas
It works, but some style guides recommend you use ‘whereas’ here
So I would probably have written:
Well, I speak Albanian, English and German decently, and by far the easiest is English
The grammar of both Albanian and German was hell to learn, whereas English grammar was quite simple
I think this is true about dubs, but the power of the dub seems to be fading due to services such as Netflix
I know when I lived in Austria, cinemas also had screenings of dubbed versions of films and then the original language version in separate screenings
German grammar is harder than English and Dutch, which is why it is easier for a German to learn Dutch than the other way around
even speaking just English and German, it was not too difficult for me to understand Dutch with only a bit of practice
I remember, in Japanese class, having to read out the Japanese for CD player, '*See Dee pu ray ah*' and i felt like I was doing a comedy accent from some seventies’ comic's standup routine
Europeans complaining that Americans like capitalism
Americans complaining about knife crime in London
Less discussion of the Disney channel and how great it was for you growing up/how bad it is now
Less I’m a child of X decade and the boomers/millennials/generation who came before or after me were shit stuff in general
Less did you know The US is big stuff like I can drive 15 hours and still be in the same state
Best of all no Fahrenheit
/r/ShitAmericansSay would be more boring
Older people in the UK use fahrenheit too
My mum and her partner do occasionally
Sometimes they use fahrenheit, sometimes celcius
And there's no consistency as to when
Most of the time they'll say the temperature (weather) in celcius, but sometimes randomly drop fahrenheit in there
I always have to look it up afterwards
All I know is 32°F = 0°C. And I think 1°C is \~ 2
5°F, or thereabouts
I know Turkey is a Islamic country where circumcision and cut dicks are the majority norm etc
but despite that in Turkey are there men who for whatever reason dont get circumcised
, and how are those men viewed/treated by other Turks & by Turkish society/culture
, Also like do you know any Turkish men who are uncut
, And do many Turkish men wish they were not circumcised
, And lastly how is foreskin generally viewed in Turkey and what do people think of uncut dicks
Im just curious to know is all since the topic of foreskin has come up
Doesn't apply to Eastern Europe unfortunately
Mainly use Imperial
The window in my sisters room in my old house had a large window like this
There's no bath or sofa's in public toilets, so that's always annoyed me
or Bog
It's not
Not at all
Milan, Rome, Turin, Naples, Genoa
Seville is a bit changed (Sevilla), Majorca (Mallorca), Catalonia (Catalunya or Cataluña), Basque Country (País Vasco)
Granted they are much less adapted than the Italian ones mind
True i misread the title a bit but many of the posts are pretty similar ie munchen-munich
I think its more ‘was’ used in English, as I have never heard anyone call Aachen “Aix-la-Chapelle’. But the other ones are pretty spot on I would say
Someone once joked to be that french only uses about 11 letters and you only pronounce about 4 of them
england or the UK depending, but never 'great britain', it's totally redundant outside of geographical contexts
I usually just say England
if it's someone from outside the commonwealth I'm British, if not I'm English
England or the UK, I identify as English-only
I don't remotely identify with "Britishness" which has effectively been co-opted to just be middle and upper-class stereotypes though perhaps that is maybe what it always has been
England if I’m in Europe, UK if I’m in America
I don’t know anyone who says they’re from Great Britain
Tbh I only hear foreign media use the term Great Britain like that
“The UK” then if I get a blank stare “England”.
Saying I'm English comes more naturally
Of course I am British, but I'm always English first
It always seemed to eme a very middle class thing to identify as British first
I don't think I know anyone that would identify as British first
I say English
I'm from an Irish family that suffered under the British in N.Ireland so United Kingdom doesn't appeal to me, and by extension of that, British are 'the other side' over there, so I stick to calling myself English
Just personal preference, I don't care at all what labels other people give to themselves, to each their own
all three depending on context
i just say uk cause its short lol
Depends on context, but "I'm from England" is the most common "I'm from" I give
From England, I think that anyone who lives in the uk likes to identify with their own country
Britain, because  I'm not a monarchist and I'm 1/4 Welsh
To be honest with you, the main reason I pick England most of the time is that it tilts the shit out of people
Londoners mostly hate it, Scots hate it, Welsh hate it
It's great
I find 'England' is much more of a cultural 'in-out' group identifier than British tbh
It depends, it's a bit of a weird one, in terms of politics,  I would always say the UK, because England is not really a political entity, but in terms of Sport, Football etc, I would definitely identify as English
When I travel abroad, I normally say English, but it depends which country I'm in, how much of their language I know, and their political situation
There is definitely a class thing and a race thing about this though, black people in England are way more likely to call themselves British, not English, and middle class people will typically use British because English is associated with people who watch football, drink Carling etc
Also, if someone uses England not UK, it's a strong indicator they probably are right wing and voted to Leave the EU
Depends, if asked my nationality, I'm English, if asked my citizenship, I'm British
England or London, never really say Britain or UK
mostly england, sometimes UK, but my friend from America stopped talking to me after he found out I was from the uk
England, and I like when people from scotland say they're from scotland etc
If I was from sweden I wouldn't want to keep saying I'm from Scandinavia
It's kind of similar
kind of
I’d say England or UK
If someone from UK asked i’d say Somerset
Idk, mostly the U.K. but if it’s to people from close eg Scotland, wales, Ireland or France, I’ll say that I’m from England
Depends
Usually England, especially when a sporting event or something is imminent
Not often do I say I’m British but usually I do when it’s to a non native English speaker, but its England to a native speaker
However if its in and around the UK and Ireland I’ll probably say my hometown or county
¿Las españolas usualmente dicen “gran bretaña”, verdad
Which is exactly why I say I'm English
I hate the idea of letting racists win our flag and essentially our national identity
So I make it point of not being a racist twat whilst being English
The union jack is safe, that's why the middle class people like it
It's the great British bake off and london 2012
The St George's Cross is associated with football and those awful people from the estate that drink carling, that's why they don't like it
It's classist
I never understand this thinking really
There's of course more far right groups in England because we are the biggest populated country in the UK
Far right parties tend to be nationalist
of course they use their national flag
Every country has them and they tend to use their nation's flag
It's strange how Scottish nationalism is all about Scottish nationality and Scotland's flag but England cannot have its own nationality and cultural pride because of some small minority far right groups that aren't really relevant anymore
English nationalism, sometimes wanting England to be independent from the UK, is bad, but Scottish nationalism who want the same thing for Scotland is good
Of course there's some negative things about English nationalism but there's negatives like racism in all forms of far right nationalism around the world primary in more populated countries
England's far right nationalism should not represent the whole of English nationalism
Scottish and Welsh nationalism is all about celebrating their country and culture
There's absolutely no reason why England shouldn't be able to do the same and English people should be able to refer themselves as English
Say that to my face and not online
Great Britain is the bigger island, the north of the island is Scotland, the sticky out bit on the west is wales, and the rest is England
The other island west of the big island, the smaller island is Ireland and the tiny bit in the north of that is Northern Ireland, and the rest in Republic of Ireland, or just Ireland
usually when be people refer to britain or british people they mean the entire UK but when just talking about the island they are explicit and say Great Britain
The "Londoner not English" lot are even worse than the "Scouse not English" lot, and it's the best thing about using England, it tilts the shit out of you lot
Thanks
Sure, Emile Heskey, England 5- Germany 1
England Till I Die
Londoner isn't even encompassing though, my mum is from Barnet and has never called herself a Londoner
Millwall fans I know all use England too, thinking about it, same with everyone I know from Dagenham
I think Londoner or English has cultural and political connotations, if you call yourself a Londoner, I'm going to assume you are probably BME and politically left of centre and voted Remain, if you use English, the assumption is you are white, politically right of centre, and voted leave
Reddit does that a lot of the time
We are evil overlords keeping the Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish with us against their will apparently
Because it's their country
Pretty sure most Unionists in Northern Ireland don't hold Irish passports
They do if they choose the British passport
Why
It's the UK
I mean you don't have to hold a British passport, but legally speaking you are still British citizens
There was a court case recently when some republican girl tried to get her American partner a spousal visa using the EU citizen form with her Irish passport, not the British citizen spouse process, and lost an appeal in the courts on the grounds she was deemed a citizen

Those things aren't what fun is all about
My school allows either
Handwritten Greek is weird
ψ looks like a “y” in cursive
We learnt a rlly simple joined up handwriting, not print but no where near cursive at about 7/8 but as soon as it comes to our main exams we’re taught to write in print if we’re in doubt about the legibility of our writing
We're encouraged to learn cursive (some schools basically force it some don't) before entering high school at age 11, but it never really becomes "the standard" way to write, at least in public schools
It's basically chaos
I first learned joined up writing, but later switched to not joined up writing
I find it really hard to write neatly, it literally takes all my concentration to do it
I find that writing non joined up, means I just have to hold that super focus for each letter, rather than a whole word at a time
What's the accent above the third 'Z' (Ż)
I know acute (é), grave (è), that triangular one they have in Spanish (ê) and the hanging one (ç), the other triangle in some Balkan languages (š), and the umlaut in German (ü)
Not sure I've seen a single dot before
Don't fancy it myself but I don't think it's *weird* of anything

no one likes the north
anywhere between the english midlands and scotland is usually the butt of many jokes
wales gets mocked a lot too, but in a weird endearing way where there's no real animosity
if we're talking about *memes* (shitty ones, albeit) probably scotland - take one look at r/ScottishPeopleFacebook and you'll see that the scots language just makes everything funnier somehow
also, slough
fuck slough
East anglia is full of inbreds and/or anywhere north of london is a shithole
And no-one ever mentions Stoke
I would've also said Chukotka and Chukchis as even we say those jokes (or at least used to)
If you're reading the above, you might correctly guess that it's is a very southern-centric view
Likewise, us northerners tend to joke about how soft and rude southerners are, it's all in good spirit though
For good reasons, let's be honest
i wish more people could stomach some good old regional hatred in the format of a joke without getting upset and taking it at face value, a lot of people here, in *wiltshire*, get sensitive about jokes about the north
not really sure why
i embrace the fake hatred we have for one another (usually fake, anyway)
also i don't drink water by itself so fuck it, good for you
dream on, serb
That's odd, Wiltshire is surely by no possible metric the North
Obviously I might be biased but I feel like up here we're quite good at taking jokes, we just give it straight back rather than getting offended in my experience
Also we joke about each other far more than we joke about the South anyway
in that way i actually favour the north, you seem to be a lot more humble than us
joke
to my understanding (correct me if i'm wrong) serbia want a reunion of yugoslavia but serbs, bosniaks and croats all sort of hate each other (or rather, can no longer live in the same space)
Newcastle-Upon-Tyne are the Geordies, Newcastle-Under-Lyme (near Stoke) aren't
i know vaguely about the history, just not the current ethnic situation, but that's about what i expected
Ah yeah, good shout, I'd forgotten that one
Absolutely not
I love my nation, and won't abandon it
Lol nope
For the simple reason that it wouldn't be home
And not only that, it would be very far from home
I'm very happy with where I live and wouldn't want to even move county, let alone halfway across the world
There are lots of issues with America that people like to bring up, but I really think this is the main reason for me
I would love to live in the US
It's been something of a pipe-dream for me since I was a kid
I'm a huge yankophile so I think I'd really enjoy it
However, I wouldn't be able to do it unless I had a sufficiently well-paying job, because I would become destitute under the US healthcare system
I would also struggle with the lack of holidays and the presence of guns
I'm gay too, and there are a number of places in the US where that becomes difficult legally
So as much as I am fascinated by the Unites States and love visiting, with my circumstances, I simply couldn't live there in its current state
No I'd get homesick
And it's too big and spread out with probably little to do if you aren't in a big city and I don't want to live in a big city
> anticonception
"contraception", btw
Probably either 'Sunday lunch'/roast dinner - for me it's usually beef/chicken/lamb etc with roast potatoes, roast parsnips, carrots, broccoli, stuffing, Yorkshire pudding and gravy)
Alternatively the famous British curries: chicken korma or chicken tikka masala
Edit: Also pies of any kind, particularly steak & ale, chicken and mushroom
For me it's melted cheese on two pieces of toast, topped with a tin of heinz baked beans
Easy to make, delicious
Don't @ me if you've never tried it
Is that really comfort food tho
It’s a whole shared family big meal
Indeed - as long as they aren't Richmond sausages
Definitely a classic
I have fond memories of steak and ale pie
Before the Rona' arrived I used to go to to a nice little pub once a month with my Grandad
We'd always go on a Thursday to get their 'pie of the day' special, which was a glorious steak and ale with the thickest crust you've ever seen
It was a proper pie too, not just stew with a pastry lid
Not weird at all
There are lots of misconceptions about British food
Yeah it's not as pretty as French or others, but it's tasty and filling, and for me that is the most important thing
Function over form
(As with a lot of British things)
Not really thought of as comfort food tho
They’re a bit of a faff to make
I suppose it's subjective really - usually it's just two of us having it on a rainy sunday afternoon
Because we speak English here are a couple of names we called differently as colonisers
Ghana: "Gold Coast"
Sri Lanka: "Ceylon"
Israel - palestine
So what would “the United Kingdom of Great British and Northern Ireland” be in polish
I think they meant like the official name in English
And I think they mean they want names that vary a lot from the English name with different etymology
Only if you're a feeble wet lettuce
What sort of man would be weak and insecure enough to be offended by such a statement
Thanks (x)
(Edit): sorry for the kiss
Been texting the mrs
You'd just have to be a total pussy to be offended by something like that
I can't empathise
Well I do like to keep my

The Ghost Bus Tours - took me ages to figure out it wasa pun; I saw them driving round but it wasn't until I had cause to say it our loud that I realised

What, as opposed to supermarket chains
Have you never been to Spainsbury's?
There's a Jason Doner Van in Bristol
I don't think we really have one Big National Poem, because we've never had the experience most other European countries have had, of being oppressed and/or fragmented and finding an expression of natural identity to glom on to
I studied Beowulf at school, maybe in Year 8 from what I remember
You can find foxes in the middle of London here
It is not remotely unusual to find urban foxes sprawling all over our cities, many people do feed them and some even do so by hand
We obviously have the typical hedgehogs, squirrels and a wide array of species in our cities, but unlike others in Europe we also have urban muntjac deer though not to the degree of foxes
Foxes roam the streets at night in many parts of London
Saw one recently on my boyfriend’s street in North London and it wasn’t even properly dark out
We have villages and towns within national parks (I know America doesn't, not sure about other nations)
The New Forest national Park has a lot of wild ponies and horses
some wander around the towns
Yes
Im in pretty centralish London (like all the touristy things are within a 30 min bike ride)
Lots of cats, none feral and all belonging to various houses but you often see them out and about laying in the sun or sniffing bins
I have actually named many of the cats and will often stop and talk to them as thats just polite
Foxes are also pretty common in all British cities, some can look a little mangy but most often they look quite healthy
The local parks have ducks, geese, swans and various other small water birds and of course squirrels
Some parks further afield have deer that are essentially wild
You will also see the occasional mouse and more rarely a rat at an underground station
Deer  fox,rabbits, stoat, voles, hedgehogs, lizards, see all sorts in yorkshire, but most varied wildlife Is slightly away from the people
The towns and villages in the new forest get horses and ponies randomly walking down the High Street
I listen to some American hunting podcasts and even the yotes are becoming urbanised, they've been seen in central park and all across la and Hollywood
Canids are exceptional generalists and very adaptable
Utterly appalling, blatant in your face corruption
The human rights abuses to build these new stadiums is an utter disgrace
I am ashamed our FA aren't boycotting the entire thing
Honestly I have never understood this stereotype
Genuinely do not get it
Sure Italian food is great fairly consistently but Spanish and Greek food has always been a hit and miss for me and there are tons of dishes here in Britain and other stereotypically gloomy places that I think are fucking delicious
I've just never understood this belief
At all
Because they're made for the climate
I look at the window now and all i can see is mist and rain, its like walking through a wall of wetness when you go outside
This doesnt make me want to eat spicy 'exciting food', I want a shepherds pie to warm the coldness from me
I think this is why southern european food is more flamboyant, if you live somewhere where it is possible to eat outside and feel inspired to make a big deal about the delights of food then of course your cuisine is going to be more exciting
If you live somewhere where food is a comfort in the bleak midwinter then its going to be a bit more simple
[Steak and ale pie] and [cottage and shepherd's pie] I don't like them because by and large I don't like red meat
But they're certainly popular dishes
Have a go at making [Yorkshire pudding] some time
It's actually a savoury food, usually eaten with roast dinner on a Sunday
You can also make [toad in the hole] with it
I think it's because a lot of people seem to think that adding spices to something makes it objectively better
Also people seem to forget that we do use herbs in our cooking, and that it isn't completely unflavoured
Not quite
Even in the Medieval ages we loved spice and trade networks were there
If you read a lot of medieval European recipes they were often heavily spiced
Of course the upper classes would have had more access to spices than the lower classes, but the lower classes would have at least been aware or them
It was later on when spices became more prevalent that the idea of simple food and letting the ingredients speak for themselves became more popular, as the upper classes wanted to get away from the lower classes who could now afford spices like them
I mean in my opinion Spanish food has always been hit and miss for me
Iberico ham is fine
Just fine
And I've never had paella that was better than just okay
It's very often bland as hell
Croquetas on the other hand
jesus christ they need to be internationalised this instant
So good
That's a myth mate
People have known spoiled food makes you ill for centuries
Spicing it up wouldn't stop that
Besides, why would they waste expensive spices on spoiled food
People use spices because they like the taste
I mean, meat roasted in its own juices along with root vegetables and gravy made from the last three (dozen) roasts is pretty delicious
Man, I feel sorry for you
Its that meme that the medieval world was grey and bland
In reality people weren't much different from today
People loved colour and flavour
In addition to the spices from the trade routes there were also a lot of herbs and spices simply growing at the side of the road that people back in the day would have known about and used (and cultivated)
There is truth to this
When I roast beef I cook it to medium-rare
My nan says that's not "proper" and cooks it til it's grey
However in that sense I'm more of a traditionalist than her
When we were known across Europe for our expertise in roasting meats, we weren't roasting it like she does
The link to the past was severed and I suppose the younger generations are more interested in bringing it back
We have so many loan words in English ironically
Mostly French
There isn't one to that level
Pretty much everyone is hated by someone
Our country's big hero is Winston Churchill but I don't even like him and like 10% of people dont
The queen
A lot of the older generation idolise her as someone that somehow keeps the country together
When no she does literally nothing
In the UK we have these people called "chavs" who are basically British rednecks or our version of Russian gopniks
They're ultra nationalist and always go on about how we're going to get revenge on Germany for WW2 because they apparently said they want an endless war
They hate Germany for everything, not just WW2
Unfortunately every country has its own version of rednecks and they're always just as dumb
You'll see them in comment sections making comments like "HA GERMANY WANT ENDLESS WAR LET'S DO IT AGAIN REVENGE
yes
Brexit
Every country in Europe is effected immeasurably by WW2
We hate you less than we hate france Germany
So chavs are all lovely and totally not nationalist or racist
Alright then, I'll find some African dude to show them
I'm sure he'll love it
Also those people definitely aren't conservatives
I mean technically we still have some semblance of an empire
It's mostly constituted by tiny islands, the inhabitants of which we fuck over just because we can
The British political establishment is horrendous
How in any way
Our last significant imperial poessison was Hong Kong which went in 97
Our Empire has been long gone for ages
I most mostly talking about the native inhabitants
Chagossians for instance
I think this is very apparent on some of the fashion based Subreddits like r/streetwear or r/sneakers were it's almost all American fashion so for example with trainers like Jordans ect whereas in Europe Adidas originals are much more popular
The most depressing place In the world
Full of smug nasty bellends

My bank account is crying I'd say expensive rather than rich
Are you implying that Glasweigan is a dialect of Scots and not an ancient language of the great old ones
Plurality yes, majority, no
Mixing up Portsmouth and Southampton is criminal tbh
Also, Portsmouth is probably literally the least posh place in the South
It does however have the most pubs per square mile in the UK
It's the kind of place where you can get a £1
29 pint in the Spoons and a £1
99 pint in a non chain pub
Portsmouth is also the ferries one, Southampton is cruise ships and freight, if you wanted to get a normal Ferry to Spain or France, you'd leave from Portsmouth, not Southampton
Its not a majority of the electorate if it isn't over 50 percent
That is a plurality
Plurality: "the number of votes cast for a candidate who receives more than any other but does not receive an absolute majority
For example, Theresa May had a plurality of seats and of votes in 2017, but not a absolute majority of either
In 2019, Boris Johnson had an absolute majority of seats, but only a plurality of the UK vote, not a majority
Hopefully we rejoin in a few years when all the old xenophobes die off
Don’t think so mate
Would it be correct to say that Spain - for the foreseeable future - *cannot* recognise Kosovo (from a political standpoint), due to the similarities between Kosovo and Catalonia
If Spain were to recognise Kosovo then, were Catalonia able to successfully declare unilateral independence and apply for EU membership, it would be harder for Spain to block their entry as others would point to Kosovo as a precedent in this hypothetical situation
Becuase they're French
The same thing happened with English and Norman French
The Norman conquerors and aristocracy over time came to speak the peasants' language, English
Cogito ergo fucking sum
Contrary to reddit memes, most British Baby Boomers grew up during the age of decolonisation and when the zeitgeist was overwhelmingly anti-empire and in favour "the bright future", so they largely don't "want it all back". Everyone forgets that Baby Boomers and Gen X formed the Hippy movement and all those young people protesting in front of South Africa and Rhodesia's embassies in the 1960s-90s.
The generation that fought in WW2 don't really comment on it too much in my experience
I've talked with a few WWII veterans and none of them regret fighting WW2 despite it bankrupting the UK and ultimately causing the Empire to dissolve, but I wager a lot of them preferred being a dominant power and do somewhat feel that Victory in 1945 was bittersweet, since it spelled the terminal decline of their country
One of them was a big fan of France, because he said the Suez Canal Crisis proved that the USA "betrayed us just to win over and please the Arabs" and that France "understood the fairness and justice of taking back the Canal they built and that we paid for" (his words and views, not mine)
I wouldn't say we view it was a shameful but rather a period of history that has no bearing on our daily lives
>  she considers them ingrates as she believes that the french occupation of Algeria was done with the purpose of helping local population ("we were just helping and they kicked us out" is a sentence I've heard a lot)
Reminds me of this clip from a French comedy show
I’d say I’m simultaneously proud that we managed to achieve such a feat, and ashamed that we did
You have a good claim to Shetland, might be a good time to ask for it back
It's less talked about than the EU, that's for sure
People know that Canada, Australia and New Zealand share a monarch with us and that you guys spell things the British-Oxford way rather than the Webster-American way
Other than that, Canada is seen as pretty "American" (Ice Hockey isn't really big in the UK, driving on the other side of the road, accents are way different, etc
) while Australia and NZ are much more familiar to us in terms of culture (closer accents, closer slang, rugby, cricket, driving, school uniform styles, etc)
> that would definitely be considered a weird position in Italy
One enthusiastically embraced by the Fascist regime, and by nobody else since
Depends imo, plenty of Italians I've met are pretty proud to say they are the direct heirs of the Romans
"While Germanics shit in the woods, we built the Colosseum" is a common comeback, whenever people accuse southern Europeans of being lazy or "not paying their debt".
So, what went on in the 1960s that triggered this "rebranding"?
Me too, could this be my way to retain EU citizenship
Well, I guess some of these changes make sense, because of your dual identity with Quebec
I assume the French speaking Quebecois never liked the Maple Leaf Forever too much ("Wolfe the dauntless hero" might not be popular in the place he conquered) and they probably didn't like the Red Ensign flag with the Union Jack either
Obviously as an English person, I think it's really cool that you guys still had an attachment to the Old Country back in the days, but if you have to choose between pleasing Quebec and the UK, obviously you must choose Quebec
The Dominion of Canada does sound a lot cooler than just Canada though
As an Englishman, this makes me really sad
Fuck brexit and fuck Boris
This is definitely spelled wrong but my brother told me that the sentence pronounced "leche su su kreker" or something like that in afrikaans means "this biscuit smells good
Ohhh yeah ok: твоя мама гей

I think Colin Furze, a maniac fueled on tea represents Britain perfectly
I moved from the UK to Portugal for 2 years, and frankly it was pretty horrifying
I moved for the sake of my partner, who had found a job out there, and I worked remotely so in theory I was in a good position to emmigrate somewhere else
Wrong
Without a job outside of my apartment, there was no opportunity to go outside, meet people, and form my own life with people outside of my relationship
I became unhealthily dependent on my partner, after the few attempts I'd made at finding some semblence of a social life failed
It's more difficult than I had realised to extracate yourself from one support system, and try and implant yourself into another one - especially if it's among people who barely speak your language, and many aren't even willing to try
This isn't a gripe against the Portuguese - they were helpful where they could be, and no one was overtly rude, but it felt far away from being welcomed with open arms
It can work well for some people, clearly
But it didn't work for me
My relationship of 8 years crashed and burned, and now I'm back living in the UK while he's still out there
(He had a great time
He found himself, and feels that Lisbon is perfect for him
His answer would be a lot more positive than mine
Technically probably [Cry Baby by Jemini] which scored a big fat zero in 2003
However, I don't think it's actively a *bad* song, just a disastrous performance on the night
To be clear, it's not great, it's [insipid and forgettable ] but it's... OK
I don't, however think there's any salvaging [Daz Sampson's "Teenage Life"] from 2006
Which one
Because it’s career suicide and no one in their right mind would do it if they were at all respectable in the music industry
I don't think it *helped* but ... did you hear the song
Yeah, at least Flying the Flag was a bit self-aware
Also, I'd add, the public perception of Eurovision is stuck in about 1975 with lamé costumes, nonsense "bing-bang-a-bong" lyrics and wobbly cardboard sets
"It's very Eurovision" is *never* a compliment
Which I think is probably part of Britain's massive superiority complex, which thinks that we're so much better than all those funny foreigners with their funny foreign ways and gobbledegook languages
This is a very true and fair perception but why/how does a Portuguese dude or dudette know so much about national British eurovision sentiments
I think a lot of people will already know this, but literally like 90% of people will wear one for like 2 weeks within November, especially at formal shit and at schools
Yeah
I respect for soldiers who didn’t even properly know what they were signing up for go to war to defend the world
Uk btw
As a Brit, yes, but I think that really is a thing that we just do
They're always selling them at schools or at shop counters for 50p or £1
Almost everyone wears one, mostly for appearances
Irishmen weren't even drafted
Many volunteered and got shat on when they got home
I have never once seen this
Or even heard about it
Have you not seen our dress uniforms
Op also said traditional
How you could you be so wrong in such a short response
Have you ever had someone come up to you, in real life, and say 'shame on you' for not wearing one
Have you ever witnessed it in person happen to someone else
In 36 years, I have never once seen this
So either you live in a very fucked up part of the country, or, more likely, this is bull
Hardly, I live in the North
The poppy appeal always had a special place in my heart because my Grandad used to sell them and I used to tag along when I was a little kid
I've lived in a lot of cities and towns across the North and I've never seen this
Maybe it's a London/Southern thing
I have gone without before
Usually because I misplace them, repeatedly
Never had a comment
I do like it because it's more consitent with how we call other countries
We don't say the Slovak Republic for Slovakia or the French Republic for France for example even though those are both their official names
So I like it in that sense and I try to use it in writing where possible
In speech though I'm kind of hesitant to adopt it
It sounds a little weird and I don't think I've ever heard anyone else say it in real life
It's always 'Czech Republic'. So I'm kind of inclined to carry on doing the same so as not to appear odd haha
I want it to be called 'Czech-ch-czech-czech-czech-ch-czechitout'
Not my country, but I do like saying Czechia
Czechia, Czechia, Czechia
Perhaps over the next decade or so it might become more common in speech
It would be nice to have a normal short name for the country that people actually use I think anyway
I just don't want to be the one to lead the change haha
Not till I've heard someone else say it
Mine is the [flag of great britain] which was used before Ireland joined the UK
The flags and heraldry associated with the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy are some of the best flags we have
If there's ever regional devolution in England I hope they use those regions purely to have use for those flags
The flags of [Essex] [Kent] and [Northumberland] are my favourites
The [Mercian] flag is also worth a shout
Damn, Ireland gon’ make me act up
Jealousy and envy are pretty different, it's just that people are often ignorant to the differences hence why they're used interchangeably
Yeah unfortunately London is basically the UK capital for everything
How often do you hear mentions of the UK pottery scene
It's hardly the backbone of the British economy
Their football team stoke city’s nickname is the potters
If spoken it is referred to as Pfizer but in writing it tends to be called  Biontech-Pfizer or Pfizer-Biontech
Nine if I’m allowed to count Latin
Eight if not:
English

Latin
Gratias tibi ago
In northern england a simple "ta" will suffice
Pronounced "tah" or like a non rhotic "tar" but you have to drag out the A or you will show yourself as a foreigner
German, French, English, Italian, Spanish, Swedish/Norwegian, Croatian (with shit pronunciation), and somewhere I know Hungarian but its not coming to me right now
So 7/8
Including my own
English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French, Dutch, German
Well that's not even relevant to the entire thread
I get that you're a bigot who is constantly pushing your agenda, but at least put some effort into making sense
Not often something is going to as bad as it sounds
The massive building with the boat on top of it
Tiny country, massive city
England experiences more tornadoes per square kilometre than any other nation on Earth
We even have a fancy Guinness World Record’s [page] to prove it
I always thought it was kind of ridiculous how we claimed defeating the Spanish Armada as some kind of amazing victory, when a storm basically did all the work for us
we have lots of little’uns
It’s just a matter of statistics
We’re a small country that experiences lots of small, weak tornados that do little damage and often go unnoticed by the general public
Hence the stat
The US is huge and features much larger and more dangerous tornadoes, so you hear about these ones more
Kinda on topic but I think its crazy that Squash isnt in the olympics
Its a great sport and even though I dont play or ever watch it I just dont understand why its not an Olympic sport when incredibly niche sports like Syncronised swimming (that seems to only be done in Russia) is
Anyways, for Team GB to win I think it'd have to be another sport that involves sitting down (we're quite good a sitting down sports like Rowing or Cycling) so maybe a motorsport which again we're quite good at
For the Youth Olympics, hula-hooping
Every primary school has at least three million of the things, there must be a reason for it
Rounders
It’s like baseball, but slightly different so no-one will know how to play it
They started practicing beforehand, which ruins the fun
Lets combine all our countries and do the Bullrun but its a huge roll of Chèvre chasing us through the streets of Pamplona
We have what are called joke parties, like the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, the Al-Zebabist Nation of Oog, and the Liberal Democrats
Greece probably
If we do, it's not every train
Tbh, UK train etiquette is that you dont really speak unless spoken to, anyway
It's kind of an unwritten rule that you don't make much noise on trains, tubes and busses on England
Kind of a common courtesy, so we dont have things like quiet zones
huh, never knew that, lol
the more you know i guess
For me its Bristol
Good mix of pretty architecture and nice houses in some parts and more edgy and vibes in others
Also has a great food, art and music scene
In the UK either Liverpool (for friendliness) or Edinburgh (for architecture and history)
Yeah boi just moved to Swansea last week, some awesome natural beauty here and the city is pleasantly small
Manchester is interesting
Man, jag älskar Göteborg
My bro is a Swedish citizen, visited him every year since 2013 and if Scotland doesn't take me in after I graduate, Sweden will
Aye York is my favourite in England for sure, as is the whole northern countryside
What about st David's? It's a city with 1,600 residents
Been exploring them both in the last 2 weeks
The train back to Yorkshire is disgustingly expensive though
Don't know why
Yeah man my buddy in Texas told me that, and it's true, the whole of Europe is tops a 3 hour flight away
Pretty freakin awesome
For example, for NYE (hopefully) I'm flying to Oslo to meet my pal then we're driving down to Munich to meet up with some other guys we met in our travels
I love Europe
If that was a Doctor Who reference, I understood that reference
I occasionally pop in to expand my horizons a little, see what's going on outside my bubble etc
Probably my business studies trip to Cadbury World in Birmingham when I was 15
wasn't that great but it's the most memorable because
chocolate
We went to Cadburys World in Birmingham
All I remember is eating a ton of melted chocolate
I dont know why we went there I just remember going there in primary school
We did lots of caving at my school, such an odd activity for teenagers but there you go
I  remember absolutely loving it but honestly now I think I would be scared shitless
actually just thought of another one
possibly year 5 of primary school going to what I think was a replica of a Victorian school
so we sat and learnt in a classroom of that era
if anyone from england knows where that might of been (south) then let me know
c'mon if you speak a few words you basically speak the language
apparently
Jimmy Saville
Sex ed in school, started in year 5 all the way through schooling
That's what we had
England/Great Britain/the UK and Portugal have the world's oldest alliance, dating back to 1373
Barring the period in which Portugal was subject to the Spanish crown, the alliance has never been broken
Portuguese soldiers served in the trenches in WW1, and although they didn't take an active combat role in WW2, they allowed Allied ships and aircraft to use the Azores as a staging post/base, which helped no end in the Battle of the Atlantic
Now, of course, the bilateral alliance has been subsumed into NATO and, until recently the EU
Don't worry, Britain is now ruining itself
I feel very similar to you but with English in place of Spanish and half Irish
like the time we colonised country #47 changed that country's history a lot but for us
eh just add them to the "Commonwealth" and call it a day
England was already unified before that, the Norman invasion was how England was conquered, not created
Alternatively, Harold winning the Battle of Hastings would also have led to a very different future for us
1066 was such an important year
That’s like _old school_. I’ve only ever heard of that happening
Don’t think I’ve ever encountered it personally
Its still used even by the youth where i live but its shortened to "howdo"
Hahah
Im from Yorkshire
Edit: you are imagining it as a posh thing,when the opposite is true
There are some things in scots that if you werent used to and were said in a posh accent you would think they came from 1900 english aristocracy
Norfolk, just so happens that's where I live
birmingham
This is something I love about Switzerland, a few hours of walking can take you from a busy city to a remote mountainside with no noise except the wind and cow bells
Have to say I'm jealous of anyone who lives in places like that
Ik Switzerland isn't all perfect, but after living in a flat area of England for so long I really wish I could have somewhere like that to get away from the world for a bit
Siberia
The taiga
That’s why I love Yorkshire in England
Almost any town and city has walkable green space nearby
Sheffield and the Peak District most distinctly applying
But the Midlands has the second biggest city in the entire country
> I'd also nominate the bit between Northumberland and Cumbria
Almost completely empty countryside apart from a few weird towns (Hexham, Haltwhistle, Wooler, Jedburgh, Hawick)
It's actually very beautiful there
Drove to Wooler once and it was unreal
We definitely have some nice places, In the spirit of this thread our "middle of nowhere" places like the Yorkshire moors and Peak District are wonderful
I often walk around there and I love it
I just get bored of my local culture, and that's probably the same with most people in Europe and their culture
Honestly there is no better feeling for me than walking into a place where no-one is speaking my language
Being a lifelong Englishman I'm getting pretty bored of England
If bored then you’re boring
Longford
Fair enough
I would argue parts of the North like Cumbria or parts of the South like rural suffolk are more middle of nowhere
I come from a medium/small town in the Midlands that doesn't have a lot going on, but I can be in a town of 200k+ in 10/15 mins, a city of 1m+ in 45 mins and London in just over an hour, so even though my town is pretty dead I can be somewhere that isn't pretty sharpish
If you were in rural Cornwall or something that could never be the case
It would be a civil war between Manchester and Birmingham
Midlands pride worldwide
Imagine being from the top or bottom of the country
Could never be me
Both
Grow up in a smaller town and move to a big city for work
Leave big city to go raise kids in smaller town
Personally, I'm going to uni so moving from small-town -> big city
I'll probably move back after though
I believe some uni students will stay in their uni city after uni
Its such a shame that Rugby isnt more popular in Europe
Its a fantastic sport and I dont see why some countries only like 1 or 2 sports
Its perfectly possible to be a fan of multiple sports
Its pretty normal like multiple sports like Football, Rugby, Tennis, Cricket, Cycling, Athletics etc in the UK
Dont get me wrong, Football is by far the most popular sport here and some peoples lives fully revolve around their local club
Well the sport(both Union and League) was invented and codified here, so it was and very much still is extremely popular here, it's arguably the second most popular sport(admittedly it's a distant second after football in most parts of England, with the exception of the South West, which is Rugby Union country and with the exception of parts the North where Rugby League(another code of rugby, it has slightly different rules, and plays a bit differently, it's the faster game in general
It's absolutely huge in Australia) predominates
But yeah it's widely played, it's watched on TV, it's played in primary and high schools as part of PE and after school teams that play other school teams(it's the same for unis too), it's a big deal in England
It's a huge part of the sporting landscape
And never forget England are the only Northern Hemisphere team to win the world cup(back in 2003 in Australia, Vs Australia, and to this day
[this moment remains one of the most iconic, unforgettable moments in all of English sports and indeed all of rugby history] ), and we should've won it for a second time last year in Japan too, but England flopped in the final and South Africa were on top of their game
I digress, so yeah it's extremely popular, defo a big deal here
And has been for a long time
As someone that watches a lot of rugby - i can tell you that the only places it gets proper national coverage is the UK, Ireland and France
Italy obviously plays it, but that largely confined to the north of the country (Veneto, Lombardy) and also Rome
With the next tier of countries:
Its pretty popular in Georgia (again in parts of the country) and they are the easily the next best ‘european’ side which is pretty impressive given the size of the country
Some people have said its as popular there as football but I’m not so sure
Rugby used to be really popular in Romania but its sort of slumped since the fall of Ceaucescu
Ive a couple of Romanian friends from uni and neither really know much of the game
They’ve heard about it and know Romania play it but thats it
Next you’ve got a few countries which are reasonable at the game but its really really restricted to a couple of cities
Namely Spain (Valladolid plus the Basque Country), Portugal (Lisbon), Russia (Moscow and Krasnoyarsk)
After that its pretty small minority game - Germany has Heidelberg where its popular but thats an outlier - apart from ex-British outposts like Malta where the game is reasonably popular but they are too small to make an impact on the world stage
Rugby is very popular
We have rugby clubs where you can learn it and play with other people in your town and Secondary schools (11-16) have rugby in PE
Incredibly
Arguably one of the National sports
Rugby World Cup finalists last year
And yeah Georgia is probably the best 2nd tier European nation for rugby
I’m not a huge fan myself but it is indeed popular
How did rugby union get to Georgia and why did it become popular
, Also why is it, how come rugby has never captured Europe's attention and why is it not popular there
Its big in Heidelberg and thats it
You guys are firmly in the 3rd tier of european countries for rugby
Hockey has always been a strange one for me in NL
If you look at the competing teams its more of a commonwealth than rugby
More akin to cricket - yet you guys love it
Yes but also no
You guys have a national team but it is alongside Finland, Turkey and Bulgaria as the worst on the continent
Its great to see the game growing though
I think one year you featured in the Rugby Europe Championship (the tournament below the Six Nations) but you got immediately relegated
Whilst i agree with your sentiment - its worth noting that we only really play sports we invented
Things like handball and basketball are big on the continent but more or less non existent here
Ice hockey has a professional league here but is still largely unknown
Rugby League is also by far the most popular and widely played form of rugby in Australia iirc
League is huge Down Under
The NRL is by some significant margin the world's best Rugby League competition
Also here in the South West rugby union is arguably more popular than football, and in the West Country rugby is certainly not the reserve of former public schoolboys, it's much more like it is in Wales, where rugby is the sport of the common people
Its big in Valladolid
Arguably your two strongest clubs are both from there
I agree though, its almost impossible to watch rugby in spain apart from in English/Irish bars
Fair enough
I assume it’s Football then Ice Hockey normally in Czech Rep
I know once upon a time you were in the second tier of european rugby but i dont know how you fare as a nation now
Strange considering you guys were in the 2007 world cup
The game has definitely gone backwards a bit there
Is the 6 Nations broadcast in the Czech Republic
, Like have people heard of it
New Zealand have started up their competition again - i dont know if the Netherlands has tv deals for Super Rugby - if not you can watch that on RugbyPass
Ive been getting up early to watch it and its been really really good so far
Also: its the only sport ive seen which currently has full stadiums packed with fans as NZ is Covid free now
Come down the westcountry
Its arguably bigger than football in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset
Its reasonably popular in Catalonia and the Pais Vasco
Valladolid is also strangely big on rugby - your two biggest clubs (both semi pro) are from Valladolid
You Fins are all to busy rallying/ice hockeying/skiing etc to care for rugby
Yeah the sport seems a pretty big deal in Veneto and to a lesser degree Lombardy
With the exception of the two Rome clubs, your entire top division comes from those regions plus your two professional teams
I dont think the situation where the Italian national side has been pretty comprehensively beaten the last few years has helped
You’re still easily the 6th best side in Europe but the gap between you and the 5th (Scotland) has grown
Its a shame - you guys are very close to hitting the big leagues with sevens
Get them into the olympics and the country might open up
Its probably worth noting that you guys only got to that stage of the world cup qualifiers due to effective disqualification of spain and romania, but after the 6N, then Georgia, Romania, Spain, Russia and Portugal - you guys are among the next best (alongside the dutch and belgians)
As a smaller child, i know it knocked the love of the game out of some of my peers
I fought through it
We teach the game completely wrong here
In New Zealand, kids compete based on weight rather than age
It develops core skills rather than just ‘might is right’
Its probably accurate but you are among the better countries in Europe
Below the Six Nations, theres a tournament called the REC that you compete in
Its usually Georgia, Romania, Spain, Russia, Portugal and whoever has got promoted that year (and usually go straight back down)
What always surprises me is for a country so football crazy, your attendances are so much lower than England, Germany and Spains
At one point Serie A had a lower average than the Championship
Is there a reason for this
Is a cultural thing
Honestly i cant see it
I think we’re pretty much saturated as it is
In England alone we’ve got 5 professional football leagues (plus semi pro below it), 1 and a half professional Rugby Union leagues, a professional Rugby League division, fuck knows how many pro Cricket leagues in various formats and numerous other british sports
Plus a pro Ice Hockey league and some basketball (idk what level as its not really my flavour)
We’re only 50-60 million people and theres only so much sport we can take in without something else moving aside
Gridiron
It's not meant to have that space in there
I know it is very much a small sport in most of europe
A lot of countries have it in their capitals but hardly anywhere else
Particularly outside western europe
Eggs, no
Milk, of course, otherwise it would go off within a day
Sometimes it doesn't even last to the date which is deeply upsetting
I hope for everybody's sake that nobody is buying that horrible stuff
People definitely drink a glass of milk for its own sake here
I know loads
You're living in a milkless bubble my friend
I probably had at least a glass of milk a day growing up
It’s become more common in the last 10 years
But it probably depends on the restaurant here
However taking home a ‘doggy bag’ is generally acceptable, most restaurants have a polystyrene container available to put your left overs in
In the UK it would be seen as very odd, I think (though I suspect most restaurants would totally oblige if you wanted to, it's just culturally 'not done')
After doing it a lot in the USA though I think it's great and we should normalise it
I dont know if its fair to say its frowned upon here but its pretty unusual
Yeah, I get the impression it's a question of whether it's ordinary to do it in the country, rather than whether it's stigmatized
Even if people in some country usually eat small portions and don't need to take anything home, it doesn't mean they'd judge you if you did
That's also the point of the doggy bag though
Either way, endeavoring to eat everything at the restaurant or to bring it home and eat later, you are trying not to waste what you paid for
Most Indian and Chinese restaurants (which are very popular in the UK) have operated as both restaurants and takeaways since forever
And recently, even before covid, many other non-takeaway restaurants have started offering delivery service with Deliveroo, Ubereats and so on
Like one of the French posters said elsewhere, it was weird to ask for a doggy bag 5 years ago, but now in many places it would not be strange
They already have takeaway boxes available and are happy to sell meals to go, so they're fine with giving you a couple of boxes to put the leftovers in if you don't finish your meal
It is not *all* restaurants though
I would not expect this service in a high-end restaurant, and in most restaurant portions are manageable to eat in one sitting anyway
I remember when I went to house parties frequently that was the rule also, although that was mainly because we were all underage so buying alcohol in bulk was tricky
It's still a private place though
You can have net curtains
For what it's worth, outside of IB the hours are more normal
I work as a dev in an IB attached to a trading desk and none of the traders or middle office work that late, and I've never seen them in on saturdays
Richard III murdered a bunch of people
Yes he did, he won a plurality in not only one but two free and fair elections in 1932, before he was even in government
This is how governmental systems work under proportional representation: acquire a plurality and then you are normally placed as leader of a government albeit in a coalition
Hitler was indeed 'elected' fairly democratically to begin with: even if he was appointed by the President, this is how governments are formed
Hitler would have been elected democratically today under the same system
He did not just take over or intimidate/fraud elections until 1933
They were entirely fair up until that point
He acquired over the percentage of the vote that Tony Blair had in the UK in 2005 in the July one
Hitler progressed through the system via democracy
That is a terrifying thought
Rather than whitewashing it and pretending he just assumed power out of nowhere, we should learn from it and reflect that radical far-right extremists are never the solution to our problems
The people helped him on his way up the ladder
It's kind of similar to how Churchill is viewed
People admire him for his WW2 leadership and aren't so aware of the other not so good stuff he did
That’s so weird, here in England we refer to rickets as ‘bendy-wendy Sweden legs’
Lol come to England especially London there’s posh sleepy straight up weirdos
I'm from Yorkshire but my parents grew up int South (although my mums Scottish) so I have a weird Yorkshire with a slightly Southern twang in certain pronunciations (still say baff and casstle)
The amount of shit i got as a youth being called posh when I actually came from a low income family was ridiculous, and even now some simpletons up here will question it
Thing it goes both ways, nobody in the south or Scotland ever made a negative jibe about my mostly northern accent
I remember a farmer from Kerry going viral in Ireland a couple of years back because no one could understand him, now that's a sign of a strong regional accent
Surely there are business travellers all over the world who often need to eat alone
Even in mcdonalds
My mind is blown by that
Mcdonalds is a cheap lunch place
And Star Wars
Is pizzoccheri often served with potatoes, cabbage and fontina
If it's the pasta I'm thinking of then it's amazing
32, One them of being the entire city of Bath, I grew up in the neighboring city so I personally have never really given much notice to the world heritage thing, just always seemed kinda normal to have ancient things of importance around
Some of ours are pretty weird though, lots of industrial revolution things
Also The Lake District is listed as cultural rather than natural which is kinda weird but also makes sense to me as I view the Lakes as the place in the UK where I feel, I dunno, my most British
Despite the fact I have always lived several hundred miles south of there
Teacake vs Cob vs Barmcake vs Bara vs Bap vs Breadcake vs Softie vs Barm vs Muffin vs Bun vs Morning Roll vs Stotty vs Batch vs Oven Bottom vs Roll vs Scuffler
I can't see how onion would make it worse
Onion makes most things better
I'm team onion
It's pronounced Scone
The correct answers are scone rhyming with ‘bone’ and a bread roll is a ‘cob’.
Cone is pronounced like bone
I'd have to do a blind taste test to find out which one I really like but I assume it would be onion
I'm just a huge fan of onions
hate them
Why can't they drop the onion from cheese and onion crisps
We have the in the UK, United Kingdom, GB, Great Britain or respective country
I think of it as 'pole-land'. It's the land of the Poles
As an English guy I say are-l-land
So the TV show Little Britain would just be Wales
> in 1913
It was renamed that long ago
Wow
One of my lecturers at uni still uses Rumania/Rumanian
I thought it was pretty cool when I first heard him say it
I'm on board with that, I think you'll just have to convince those Northern Irish
Swap it for Cork
An end to democracy, sounds great
Essentially there's a (slight
) majority in Northern Ireland that want to remain being in the UK, which is why when Ireland became independent, Northern Ireland remained in the UK
The minority Republicans want to be reunited with the rest of Ireland
Not me, but my mum was really into Egyptian stuff when I was born, and I narrowly avoided being called something like Hapchetsut or Nefititi
We named my youngest half-brother after his maternal great grandfather Viktor
We anglicised it though, by using a C (I didn't actually catch onto that until he was about 3)
I don't know if it counts as 'foreignness' since technically they were once English, but I love Shakespearean names, especially for girls; 'Viola', 'Cymbeline', 'Lavinia', 'Valeria'. I feel like if I started trotting out little Cymbeline though, it'd raise some eyebrows
I'm not trying to be pretentious, I just think they're really pretty, but that is definitely how it would be perceived
I would name my child chiara or fabio depending on gender
Unfortunately I don’t have a drop of Italian in me
Awh, I quite like Joyfully-Joe
He (she
) sounds like a cheerful sort
I like Japanese names too
I really like a lot of the Russian versions of names for men, Mikail, Nikolai
They just sound nicer, but it would be weird if I randomly gave my kids Russian names
Can you imagine the shit I would have gotten at school
Yes
Nefertiti
My mum also liked Anuksunamen
She also wanted to call my brother Amenephis
Ukrainian, I believe
Oh well, either way it would be weird
Well, I don't even want kids, but if I did I would be seriously tempted
Yes, this was long before the Mummy films came out, so I'm sure she was an actual Egyptian princess
Explain that to me
How do you get Sasha from Aleksandr/Aleskandra
fuckin lol of course we do
that's why there's the stereotype of people from eastern europe wearing Adidas tracksuits
or young inner city English people wearing big North Face puffer jackets
or football fans in Britain wearing Stone Island coats to games
of all the "do Europeans (because of course Europe is a homogenous culture where every country is the exactly same) do this
" questions this one is probably the most bizarre
and we once got "do Europeans know what corn is
My view on Italy has dampened a little because me and my girlfriend received some racist abuse and was stared at a lot for being a mixed-race couple, particularly in Rome
Though we still loved our visit and have every intention to returning to Italy and visiting more of Italy as we only visited Milan, Crema and Rome
Thats a totally unfair view of France IMO
Even with the UK are super London centric so I understand why people might only come to London but France is so, so, so, so, so much more than Paris

> I was on a bus when I learned about the outcome of the vote and I started sobbing like a fool
Still blows my mind how personally a lot of continentals took the vote
I don't say this to diminish your feelings, but if I lived in Italy and you voted to leave the EU I don't think I would have been personally offended
It really highlights how differently we saw the EU compared to continental Europe
I find it odd that as a Greek person it wasnt until 2016 you became weary of Turkey
So you transitioned from believing one extreme stereotype to another
Sound like a very balanced, rational person
It's pretty interesting to see eu citizens to be so personally attacked to us leaving
I separate the eu from countries and see them for their food, music, language and culture
Ive traveled to spain countless times and love your country to bits
However If we were still in the eu and let's say spain were too leave and I say this kindly, I wouldnt care
> In the process betraying their brothers for about 73 years and losing a lot of things that made them Great in the first place
What do you mean by this
Who were our brothers for 73 years
Austria pros:
- Beautiful landscape
- Skiing
- History
- Beer
Austria cons:
- Not so friendly
- Speaking German will *not* help you
Not a big deal in the grand scheme, we had positive experiences as well, just a little jarring as we hadn't even stayed 2 nights
All our other expectations were more than met and we have every intention to visit Sicily, Naples, Florence and wherever else in Italy
Yeah it's her favourite movie
IMO as France still has so much going on outside of Paris like huge tourist resorts in the Alps and the South as well as various parts of the wine country it is less capital centric as the UK
Getting tourists to see something in the UK that isn't in London is like blood from a stone
Many people think London is actually a country
I fully empathise with how that would of felt for you and I feel sad and ashamed that my country made you to feel so rejected
However, I believe that if I was obsessed with Italian culture, spoke the language, lived and made a life for myself and then Italy ran an campaign to leave the EU based on an anti European sentiment, I wouldn't be personally hurt
Simply because I as a British person don't really identify as a European so it wouldn't feel like an attack on me
That's all I'm trying to highlight
I don't think a lot of British people realised how strong the European feeling is in a lot of continentals
I'm from the UK and I dislike having English as the current dominate language
Ive three questions
To any a non-native English speakers reading:
* What did the English language sound like to you before you learned English
* Also what did the various English accents(English/Welsh/Irish/Scottish/American/Canadian/Australian/New Zealand) etc sound like to you before you learned English
, Could you differentiate them
* And lastly does English sound like a Germanic language to your ears
I know this sounds kind of strange but as an English person I do, because in america, they treat the language as if it is theirs (like many other things)
I know its a petty reason but it annoys me
I've always found it useful to have a lingua franca, I can speak to most people online (and off tbh) with my native language
In 2019 and 2020 I went to Azerbaijan, France, Czechia, and Greece, and in all  four English was enough to get by
We realise how privileged we are
Everyone in England laughs about "fuck me everyone Europe is so impressive with languages, good job we don't have to be I think we'd struggle".....
I have a friend who is half English and half German and grew up in the UK, apparently whenever he meets Germans they ask to speak German with him because he says his father taught him fluently
His father is Swabian
apparently you can speak German with a really think Swabian and English accent at the same time
I've never seen an English person annoyed someone not English doesn't speak English
I feel this is an intra European pressure
When you say it sounds quite nice, can you elaborate on why that is
, Also as a Pole what did English sound like to your ears before to understood it
, and lastly does English sound like a Germanic language to your ears or not and why is that
wtf is this post
Not neighbouring country (neighbouring island) but I really do fear a sealand invasion
We’re an economic threat to ourselves, does that count
Our neighbours have been trying to help us massively the last couple of years or so by telling us how much better off we’re in the EU, but unfortunately 52% of our people are too bigoted and dumb to listen
Scotland: No, we hate each other in sports but we are brothers
Wales: No, too unpopulated, but they’re nice as well
Ireland: Historically, due to *certain* politicians and Prime Ministers in our country, now made the Irish hate us
France: What would we do without you
Isle of Man: Errrrrr yeah just, do what you’re doing
Those pesky Corns
Tractors and Ice Hockey for everyone in Ukraine then
It's not coming home anytime soon
Oooooh hot take from a scot
thanks man : )
Which ones
Erm I'm a native English-speaker and *I wish* I could follow Dutch just by virtue of already knowing English
Dutch and English aren't mutually intelligible
You must have some very smart friends
I watched an interview with Graham Norton recently in which he talked about being raised Protestant, and because of that literally didn't feel Irish
"We're"
Please don't talk for all of us
Ermm
I don't think that example serves your point very well dude
Anti-muslim bigotry is not to be accepted
>well, ok
Why not
It’s their feeling
\^\^\^ that is not the appropriate response to someone saying they're not comfortable around muslims
Omg
very different mate
And if you can’t see the difference I don’t see much point with continuing this conversation
And where did that land him
An early grave in my home county of Yorkshire
It'll be a cold day in Hell before I recognize the Holy Roman Empire
London’s been done but London/England under the romans vs the celts could be fun
Could do either side but considering Ubisoft is French they’d defo be the celts lol
Not sure about accidentally, but it has become a Christmas tradition

The height of rock music in the 70s and 80s? Do you mean the 60s and 70s?
Rock music was popular in the 80s but various other genres had certainly broken through
When someone says '80s music' new wave is usually the first thing that comes to mind
wow,  fair few of them had breakthroughs here too
'Sylvia' is on my driving playlist, along with 'Twilight zone' & 'Radar love' :)
Unless you’re counting Scots
fuck all
German, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, etc
are all completely unintelligible to English speakers
I can’t speak German, however when it is written down there are some parts that I can work out because of how closely related it is to English
Hmm, Dutch is quite similar, not spoken but written
Some German and Norwegian is as well
Scots is very similar and its fairly easy to understand
Frisian is a bit similar as well, so is Afrikaans
Swedish and Danish i have little clue about it
Hanged, drawn and quartered

Famine
Yeah - the 2010s reforms brought that up on the agenda highly
It's in place now
In the UK there are a a lot of people that want Scottish independence and people that want Northern Ireland to join the Republic of Ireland
Wales and Cornwall have very small movements for independence too
Yes
There is an independence movement for Scotland, which has a reasonable chance for succeeding
They would probably join the EU
The Welsh independence movement is small, but has grown as the main political party advocating Welsh _interests_ or Welsh _autonomy_ has moved more clearly to Welsh independence under new leadership
Although everyone knows there is calls to join Ireland, there are also a small section of Northern Irish that want NI to be independent in its own right
Finally, there are small movements in Cornwall, and Yorkshire
Interestingly, noone from Crown Dependencies or Overseas Territories want to be independent, although the Chagossians, who were expelled by the British from their native land to form an American base, have been making a campaign with little success
There really isn’t any movement in Cornwall for independence
Yorkshire is more likely to declare independence than them
Just did a quick google and there was a petition of 180,000 signatures, which is fairly small given that 9,000,000 live in London but then again there could be millions who didn’t sign to petition but would of done
52,000 people in the county put Cornish-only as their ethnicity on the last census, and they had a petition of 50,000 signatures to get a devolved Cornish Assembly (One similar to that of the Welsh Assembly or Northern Irish Assembly)
They want autonomy more than independence, but to say Yorkshire is more likely to declare independence is just wrong
It used to have its own language and Cornish people are a recognised national minority group, and are Celtic like Wales for example
Did they
I thought the last one was in 2014
If Northern Ireland did vote to join, would Ireland make any compromises to keep the local Protestant/Loyalist community happy
Things such as making Ulster-Scots a co-official language with English and Irish, joining the common-wealth, letting the North keep a devolved parliament, etc
I never knew Corbyn mentioned the Crown Dependencies
What did he say
Love to know the real life % of those that signed that that actually live in London and weren't simply foaming mouthed lunatic level remainers
Sounds like the SNP
Would have***
Sorry lol
The government said that the last referendum would be a once in a generation vote
Boris Johnson reaffirmed this when the Scottish first minister requested another referendum which the UK government rejected in January
It could be a while till we see another one
This isn't how it's going to work
If the UK still exists then you need to reverse the GFA, Stormont, self-determination, everything else you could possibly think of remains
Unification is not the act of ticking a box to make the British, Irish
It's the act of gaining some control
Otherwise why would we not be allowed to enact your proposals for ourselves
I hardly speak any spanish but I know that morning and tomorrow are both mañana, meaning tomorrow morning is "mañana por la mañana"
For us, Tea can mean both the drink and dinner
Unless that is just my family that does that
In Chinese the character for both 'moon' and 'month' is the same
And to lie down doesn’t mean you lie, but hey ho that’s languages for you
Something similar exists in English as well, using learn to mean teach, but it's very non-standard and quite stigmatised
In Middle English we had *lernen* 'to learn' and *leren* 'to teach' but at some point *leren* was influenced by *lernen* and adopted the same form, just like I imagine happened in Dutch
To any Dutch and Scandinavians reading ive two questions to ask you
* As a non-native speaker what did the English language(and the English accent) sound like to you before you learned English
* Does English sound like a Germanic language to your ears
, And do you hear any similarities between English and your own Germanic languages
When asked by a Brit I'll say Cornwall (province), when asked by a non brit its usually just "England".
Id say overall i identify with my country, but in many ways i couldnt be more different from a Londoner, me being from the countryside
I could have more in common with a Frenchman from the countryside than an english Londoner
Country
I'm from the middle of the Midlands
Doesn't really have a strong regional identity
Well, I’m originally from the East Midlands of England but though I’m happy to be from there, it’s not my home
I moved to London about 8 years ago and I much prefer it to the Midlands
I do feel like a Londoner, even if I’m not a native Londoner
But with regards to the question, I don’t really feel more strongly about being a Londoner than I do about being English or British, or vice versa
I’m a Londoner, Englishman, Briton, and a European
None of these identities are in conflict
there’s just at different levels of specificity
I identify most with my region, the West Country (South West England)
London, the North and other areas at times can be quite alien to me
To anyone not British I’d say i’m English as most don’t know the SW anyway
I identify as being British and European too but those would be last
Region > England > UK> Europe . I live in an area with a moderate regional identity so would say that if asked by a fellow British person, but to a non-British person I would just say I am English
I have been known to say 'near London' in the past but that is far from true
Geordie first, Northerner second, English third, British last
I'm proudly English, and then British
Thats interesting, that how in antiquity Greece was all about city states and it was all city pride, famously so

We used to go for walks and bike rides around the peat moors
I read a lot and did lots of drawing
I subscribed to a pony magasine where i got a toy pony each month and i used to make stables out of cardboard
I also swam competitively from a young age which took up a lot of my time as I got older
riding my bike, video games, board games, tv, drawing cartoons, toys and whatever fad was in at the time (yoyos, tamagotchis) riding my scooter, indoor softplay places, nature/animals
For some reason I've always struggled with 'bald' always comes out as 'bold' much to the amusement of my friends
I live in italy and even my very talented partner can't tell the difference between 'butter, better, batter'
Or as a lot of spanish speakers do, overcompensate for it by pronouncing it as they do a "j" with that sort of throaty "ch".
"Chhhello
Chhhow are you
Can confirm, scoiattolo in Italian challenged me for years
Pronounce flour exactly the same as flower
I though it's pronounced as it's spelt - 'he-ge-mo-ny'?
Is there any evidence that this is even true
This thread is full of anecdotes and stereotypes
I doubt there any difference, it's probably just in your head because you've been told that the UK is dangerous
Is there actually any statistical evidence that drunken fights are more likely in the UK than Germany
I went out most weekends in my late teens, there was often a police riot van sat on the road, though I never actually saw it in use
I saw the odd fight but it largely involved people who were looking for fights
Very easy to avoid
Never felt unsafe
For context this is based on a few towns in the South West of England and I’m female
I agree with the comment that some people go out to get drunk, but I highly doubt the UK is alone here and it’s by no way a reflection on what most people do, perhaps more common with groups of young lads
I’ve never been on a nightout in Germany so no idea how different it is really
Exactly
You’d never get a question like this asked about another country on this sub
It’s so obviously biased
it’s total bullshit, you’d never get posts like this made about another european country in this sub
It’s soooo blatant
Yeah but UK bad
Edit: Also I don't really know where this stereotype comes from
Maybe people generalising an entire country because of some Brit lads in Ibiza
I've lived all over the UK and have never seen a fight in a pub, nor much by the way of an uncontrolled drinking culture
Even in some pretty rough around the edges pubs in North/East London, worst I've had was a dodgy stare when I accidentally knocked into someone leaving the toilets
You're just describing the stereotypes, I'd be curious to see if there is any evidence to support them
But I doubt there is
> The only countries* feeling similar are our neighbours
Out of curiosity, which countries
[Dungeness] perhaps
Apparently it's one of the largest expanses of shingle in Europe
It's ecologically quite important too, I think particularly for some rare insects if I remember correctly
[Brimham Rocks] a relatively unknown spot near Harrogate, North Yorkshire
Sort of on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales

My favourite for England has always been the hamlet in Dorset known as Shitterton
No need
Absolutely no need

There's [Shitterton] For obvious reasons haha
Not quite so funny but there's a also hamlet near the town of Sandwich which is named Ham, leading to [a mildy amusing sign that reads 'ham sandwich']

Remember in the floods that happened in Cumbria a couple years back and the BBC presenter mumbled when he said Cockermouth so it came out at cummuf or something
There's a village near me called Fingringhoe
I can't tell if you're just making these up, but Australia is a strange place
There's also a Crapstone in Devon
Also, scroll down [this page] and look at just how much cock we have in the UK
A veritable abundance of cock, a plethora if you will
My favourites are Cockermouth, Cock Bank, Cockfield (two places), Cocklake and simply Cocks
There are also a few roads named Cock Alley or Cock Street
I can never read Århus without singing, [*Århus, in the middle of år street
Mmm cock
Yeah like Bournemouth and Plymouth and that
For sheer "single error by one or two people with horrible consequences", I'd submit the [Quintinshill rail disaster] of 1915

>In February 2016 the County Court in Nový Jičín sentenced the driver to 8 1/2 years in prison, and banned him from driving on Czech territory until 2026
What were the mitigating circumstances which meant he didn't receive the full tens years, and why wasn't he banned permanently from driving in Czechia
I've heard Hindenburg described as one of those men who kept on living well beyond his time, then managed to die at the absolute worst moment
It depends on who I'm talking to, I'm an atheist, but I'm not going to force my lack of belief on an upset grieving person
Well, I think it's more considerate to just say whatever religious stuff the grieving person wants to hear, rather than remaining awkwardly silent whenever god/religion is brought bought up
Well you can't 100% disprove the existence  of vampires, but if someone asked if you believed in them you'd probably just say no
I acknowledge that I can't prove the non existence of god, but I say I'm an atheist because I just feel like there isnt a god, and I don't feel the need to sit on the fence
If i'm wrong, I'm wrong
English guy here with a polish surname and I don’t think anyone has said it perfectly first try before
I always have to do the thing where I spell it out letter by letter to the check-in people
Had an American tour-guide ask me and my Northern Irish boyfriend if we liked our new prime minister, Boris Johnson
We do not
Username doesn't check out
Not in London
Eerie
Still none yet :(
I'm begining to think we're just not getting any at all, which would be a bit disappointing
With any luck maybe we'll get a little a bit later on, towards the end of February / start of March
We do tend to get snow a bit later on in winter here but still, to think it's nearing the end of January and we haven't had even a light 15-minute episode of snow is a bit of a shame
English Midlands and not yet, however February is usually our snowiest month so here's to hoping
No but it never really snows in East Anglia due to being in the rain shadow
Nope none where I am, its been bitterly cold but not snowy
Snowed a little bit in South Yorkshire your but only for a day, wasnt alot of snow either more like frost
I wouldn't say it's massive but it's a thing & trusted
During the night time/midnight they have teleshopping on some of the main tv channels

Most recently our current prime minister was born in New York
We've also had several foreign-born monarchs over the years but the most recent one was quite a while ago with George II who was from Germany
Bonar Law was born in Canada
Here's a few I can remember off the top of my head
Geography - Libya's flag is entirely green
They changed it 8 years ago to red, black and green horizontal tricolour with the Ottoman Star and Crescent
Corrected her at the end of the quiz but she doubled down
Geography - We had a textbook that didn't have the Mediterranean on a diagram about ocean currents
Wasn't the teacher but still that's ridiculous
She just told me it was likely because the Mediterranean isn't relevant for that map but it's still confusing af
Biology - Fungi are non-flowering plants
Asked her afterwards and again she doubled down
Researched it at home and tried to tell her but she ignored me
In fairness, I was an annoying /r/iamverysmart type 12 year old
I've also seen numerous maps missing South Sudan, but in fairness it's only been a nation since 2011
Usually its been on worksheets so I just add it on by hand
The worst map I've seen in a school was from my younger brother's, when I went to pick him up
Its worth noting that because my stepmum is head of languages at this PRIVATE School he gets a massive discount
The map still included Serbia and Montenegro as one state
They've been seperate for 13 years
Bloody hell, that's basic
Bruh, tell that to the Tasmanians
Though good luck with that
We "saved" them pretty hard after all
Surely the Ancient Greek word for wisdom is Sophia
As a mute, I can confirm that I do not have thoughts
You could argue that any county started WW1
Perhaps it was Russia's fault for getting involved in an otherwise one-on-one
Was it Germany's fault for bringing the rest of Europe into it, making it a world war
Was it Belgium's fault for not letting Germany through, making the war far more bloody and long-lasting
I mean, it's not correct, but you COULD argue it
Actually no, I don't think
Am saving this comment for when Covid-20 arrives and I know who to blame
Yeah, every time there's a bit of snow, the media act like it's a Snowpocalypse
Charlie Brooker on Snowpocalypse:
And don't forget
"Norway/Canada/Russia/Switzerland cope, and they get *much* more snow than us
Why is Britain so crap
>Surely snow has happened in the past
Yes, but its only majorly disruptive for maybe one or two days every few years
It's not really worth us having fleets of snowploughs and gritting depots on standby just for the occasional freak occurrences when it snows heavily
That being said, the media coverage is ridiculous
I disagree with you op, i think it would be;

I've never heard this one before
Slovakia is considered quite a safe country with quiet people in the UK
Certainly not somewhere Brits consider dangerous in any way, like for example Turkey, where there is an actual chance you may get stabbed for causing a ruckus, or Spain where the police are always looking for a chance to give you a shoe in
Couldn't see any articles on Google of British tourists being badly beaten or stabbed in Slovakia
Where are these tough guys
I'd argue that you shouldn't do this in any country
We have bike paths with bike pictures here, but it isn't a full system like you have, so we don't have to worry about bike traffic here
When I visited Denmark, I mostly remembered to stay out of the bike lane, but sometimes I forgot
Omg yes, I was so unimpressed haha
Go to the design museum instead
Fucking ace
I think taking a shit just off the highway is frowned upon is a lot of countries
You’re telling me it would be more acceptable to pop a chub than wear a towel in a sauna
>Slovakia is pretty safe country in general
That was not my point
But fighting sports are quite popular over here, many people do boxing, muay thai, mma etc
as a hobby
It's the same in the UK mate
We have a ton of world champion boxers
probably third or fourth behind USA, Russia and Mexico
UFC Champions and top 10s also
Fair play on the weapons point though
It's a good point
That's fair

IKEA was not a luxury my family and probably many others in England like me go out to get a shoe rack and then end up lounging about in he rooms and buying everything from he bargain section
What are you talking about
IKEA is anything but luxury
It's where you shop when you're a student or want something basic
IKEA is probably the cheapest furniture store in the UK
How on earth could it be luxury
Actually pretty concerned there's now other Europeans thinking that we consider IKEA luxury and our houses are shitly decorated
Heals is luxury
Also it's known for being hard to leave
Its different for everyone
It's too serious whenever the person taking it stops laughing

Desserts, I'd love to be proven wrong but the variety of sweets, pastries, puddings etc is unmatched in my opinion
The Indian subcontinent also has an obscenely large variation of deserts to be fair
Thr council pop in the north of england and Scotland is also bloody delicious
If i went to someones house and they were drinking bottled water, it would seem completely foreign to me
I haven't had the pleasure unfortunately, are they distinct or do they follow a French tradition
Luckily my sister in law is a pastry chef here in italy, so unlimited incredible desserts are the order of the day
I didn't realize, my experience of Indian desserts derives mostly from Indian restaurants in the uk and they leave a lot to be desired
We can handle spices more than any country in Europe bar maybe Hungary
Guaranteed
Do you remember what the book was called
Sounds interesting
To be honest calling them fries really isn't right
To a British person fries and chip shop chips are something different entirely, so they have different standards
Eh, they do but they're always shit 'pubs' which do terrible versions of fish and chips
I think simply because as much as we have loads of access to the ocean, we have also always had loads of pastureland so good meat was never a problem
I'm all for good natured ribbing, but there is really no truth to this
We have adopted Indian food as our national cuisine
Look at the popularity of nandos
I would bet all my savings that your average Englishman has a greater tolerance to spice than say an Italian or Frenchman
You can say traditional British food isn't spiced, but really what European cuisines are, besides Hungarian
Italian uses minimal spices, French uses minimal spices, Spanish pushes the boat out with paprika but even then not loads
And when it comes to it, traditional British food does make use of spices like cinnamon, mace, mustard, ginger etc
Just straight up talking out your arse
Firstly I don't know what a 'third world' spice is
And if you find them overpowering that just means you come from a food culture that doesn't use a lot of spice so you're not used to it
There's nothing wrong with that, in fact I like Mediterranean food but compared to other cuisines it tends to be about light use of herbs and spices and letting the flavour speak for itself
Though I don't know what health has to do with that
Oh sorry I misunderstood your comment
> like the Turkish, you use peppermint as a spice
Do we
When
Thats and american making a mint sauce which is a herb, not a spice
Mint sauce is used for things like lamb which you would have with roast potatoes
Its on par with things like mayonese
Also its a herb closer to spearmint than peppermint which is a different flavour
Peppermint taste like menthol and we dont commonly  use it in our cooking
Im sorry, did you not read the rest of my post
Its a *herb* sauce
Not a spice
We dont use mint as a spice
Do you understand the difference between a herb and a spcie
Or does that not directly translate into german
Also in the UK mint and peppermint are two different things, when you buy 'mint' from the supermarket you get a differnet product to peppermint
I think perhaps come to the UK and see if you can find peppermint in anything but toothpaste
Yep, there's a chain called Mleczko here
I live in an area with a lot of Poles
It isn't rare to see "Polski Sklep"s here either
Although there are a lot of different groups of immigrants in general, it is also quite common to see shops with all sorts of flags including Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, etc
English——
Easy to get polish groceries in even the smallest towns in  England
Lots of poles have opened shops here
I’m in the  ex-industrial heartland of the north and the steel/coal has switched a small percentage of employees over to factory and warehouse work
Rightly or wrongly the central and e.europeans have gobbled up a lot of these jobs and their shops have followed them across the sea
I use some of their shops quite regularly, some are brilliant but asking what is in a product and what it tastes like etc is often like trying to get blood from a stone
Which rightly or wrongly discouraged integration
Even some Asian former shops have been bought out by a the central and e.europeans
Tons in London
From a town in England called Boston, I was there a few weeks back and I wouldn’t be surprised if there was more than 40 now, cabanossi and tymbark are some things I love from them that I know the name of anyway

My town of about 25k has at least 3 I can think of off the top of my head
Not really Europe, but I am in love with Chinese history
They pioneered so many things before Europe, for example whilst Western Europe was in the age of the shield wall, China was using rocket artillery, shotgun spear hybrids and even primative flamethrowers
Likewise they also pinoeered many aspects of a eraly modern society before the collapse of Rome
For example widespread literacy, centralised industry and a feudal nobility were all used in China before 500 AD
It bugs me that we don't learn more about Chinese history in the west
Its all well and good knowing about Henry VIII's many wives, but we don't get one word of the 20 million casualties of the Taiping heavenly rebellion
Likewise we know all about D-day and Pearl Harbour but I've not heard anything about the >15 million deaths of the Second Sino Japanese war that happened simultaneously
This is what makes Chinese history so interesting for me, the Chinese dynasties and their surrounding cultures have made a huge impact on the western world and achievied so much before us, yet we don't learn about it much here
1890s Just to have a look at the nice prewar buildings
It would have to be in the Victorian era
The extreme opulence and the slums combined with an empire must be a fascinating time to visit
Mainly, I know:
British (also know the Scottish, Welsh ones
England doesn't have an official language but know Jerusalem/I vow to thee my country/Rule Britannia)
French (only 1st and 2nd verses), German, Italian among other bigger countries due to their presence
&#x200B;
Among others, I learn them due to connection to UK (e.g. Amhran na bhfiann in Ireland), Hockey (So Swedish/Finnish/Russian) and some random ones I've learned (although they're foreign ones like US/Canada/Australia)
I can recognise obviously the UK’s and England’s (like the one they use at the Commonwealth Games etc) other European ones I can recognise are probably France, Germany, Russia, Ireland and Italy
I know half of the first verse of my own
That’s it
I wouldn’t know the words but as well as my own i would know the following when I heard them - The US, France, Russia, Italy, Finland, Japan, Spain, Argentina, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia
Basically countries that either regularly feature on F1 podiums or we play them at Rugby (thus i also know Flower of Scotland/Irelands Call/The welsh one - despite not being official anthems)
The US/Russia I know because of their media coverage being major world powers
I suppose my knowledge of them comes from the 6 nations (Ireland, Wales, Scotland, France, Italy)
I dont think I could hum any other anthems but I'd probably recognize the German one
Christ, when did we last hear the Italian anthem on a podium
Fisichella in 2006
I remember it used to with Alonso at Renault
Used to kind of annoy me a bit as the cars were built in England as are Red Bull and Mercedes
Eventually got over that though
Out of interest how much is Frisian used in Friesland
Is it in the education system like Welsh is in Wales
Jerusalem is epic
Im now wondering if that bit isnt aired as often over here or if i just zone out
Ah i see, does this mean the language is on the wane
Not being spoken in the cities/towns, not really having to use it at school etc
I support it being voluntary but I know its harmful for smaller languages
Coronation Street:  10,302 episodes, been on TV for 60 years
The soap opera Coronation Street which has been going since 1960
It has 10,213 episodes
Some Scottish people basically speak a different language at you, so them
I always love the old [Strabane Man] clip
The question is are there any accents from *your* country that are hard for people to understand
Yeah, but they wouldn’t have a French accent then would they
There's islands next to Africa which are technically part of france
No one wants that
Neither was I..
Depends on what kind of job you have
If your job is more practical you're not allowed for safety reasons
A lot of places don't allow jewellery just to cover their ass legally if it gets lost/stolen
Outside the workplace older people frown on it more than younger people
South Africans are brutal man
They don’t cut any slack for anything
Generally click quite well with them
Minus the racism of course
In Britain we don't use the British Billion for some reason
I guess at some point around WW2 the use of the world Billion as in 1,000,000,000 became more widely used as businesses and even people started to actually have that much money so having a word other than Million Million was actually useful
Back in the 1700's I can't imagine anyone but scientists having to think about numbers that large
Jesus - try that in a british uni and the whole student body would be on strike
Been an atheist for decades, but even after all that time it still doesn't show on the outside
More seriously I have had mates for years and years and have absolutely no idea what they think of religion
It is usually the norm to be atheist
The progression of modern science has drawn a lot of people away from the bible and more towards the atheist side of things
I believe within this century, the UK will become a predominately atheist country
I rarely meet people my age (under 20) who say they are religious
I mean as a 17 year old I've found that with people my age it's kind of the default to be atheist
I think there's a certain subgroup of 13 year old atheists that don't know much about the world and spend too long on Reddit so think all religious people are like the extremists on the Bible belt in America
I mean they kind of absorb the rhetoric that atheists are oppressed because in parts of America they are and Reddit is dominated by Americans
Atheists have it pretty good in the UK because most people don't really care
He looks like some form of albino orangutan

Last time I was visiting my dad's place I jokingly remarked that I'd give him at most a week before he caused the pound to plummet again
He managed it in less than 24 hours
I’ve just realised from this post and the comments that, as long as people understand what you are referring to, it doesn’t actually matter at all
For the record though, I pronounce it BudapeSt
I think it’s probably “correct” to pronounce it BudapeSHt though
I always forget how far South the Canaries are due to their popularity
Greek and Mandarin
Greek because my grandfather is Greek and I still havent properly learned it and Mandarin because it seems useful
I’ve been answering this question that way for years, took the words right outta my mouth
Those arent real words
My former soviet (South Ossetian) stepmother has never really brought it up
HOWEVER, back in 2018 we went to visit an old family friend in Poland (Rscezow - I think that's spelt right)
As we drove past one such monument in the city centre he told us how the locals have taken to calling it "Pussy" because it looks vaguely like a vagina
When I was there earlier this year, a lot of them saw themselves as Russian, it's a split, the boomers look bad to the USSR more, the younger population look to modern Russia
They've even started flying a fake Russian flag (literally the same as the current Russian flag but a bit longer shape) on their 'state buildings' next to the Transnistrian flag (which is a flag of Soviet Moldova)
The Lenin statues and communist era shit is everywhere there, but their President wants to start getting rid of it and try to get tourism focussed around imperial Russia and a shitty imperial Russian fortress at the city of Bender (which won't work, you can just go to Russia to see Russian imperial history)
It's different with the ethnic moldovan population in the PMR, but they are a minority there
I mean they won't actually join Russia, because Russia doesn't want the liability, and they have better than normal relations with Moldova atm because Moldova has a pro Russian president, but still, I would say Transnistrians see themselves more as Russians than their own nationality
No queuing and if the barman serves you before somebody you knew was there before you then you should tell the barman
The first point is fair, however it drives me mad when bartenders pay absolutely no attention to who steps up to the bar first
You have two fucking jobs: serve the drinks and pay attention to who comes first
Nothing more frustrating than standing at a bar for ages and then the dimwitted barman serves some prick at the other end of the bar who stepped up twenty seconds earlier
Said prick is always fully aware of what he has done as well but doesn't care
What if I've been in there plenty of times (they know what I drink on sight), I've spent plenty of cash there in the past, but I'm having a break from the booze, so I order a lime and soda and a bag of scratchings
A large pub near me with lots of big screens for the football deals with this problem by making you purchase a voucher at the door that you exchange for drinks at the bar
That seems so weird
When football is on in pubs here everyone is getting super wasted
It would get expensive quickly, knowing me
No they wouldn't lol
It's not the guns you have to watch out for, it's the shillelaghs

I live in a small town in england and n the roads the cycling infrasture is terrible
However being an ex mining town and ex industrial region, there is an abundance of old disused railway lines that have been converted into walking/cycling/bridleway trails  you can get across the entire country on them in the north of England
I think nearly 500 miles in total
I'm very lucky, I have used them my entire life for various reasons and now I use them to get to work
I ride for
2 minutes on a country road then the trail takes me directly to work  as in the fence of my work is on one side of the trail
As a kid I used them to visit friends, bike rides and they went directly between my mums and dads houses
Pretty shit
They're loads of moves to improve it but there are far to many thick as shit people here who dont understand how better cycling infrastructure improves all our lives
Haha I was at Edinburgh fringe last year and in the big park the cycle lane was stuffed with people
We saw a cyclist flying through it screaming
IT'S A BIKE LANE
IT'S A BIKE LANE
Had me and my mates in stitches
Sheffield is fucking shite too
Ridiculously hilly and convoluted roads with cycle lanes that vanish suddenly
Living in Swansea atm and it does seem better, particularly the dedicated cycle lane across the sea front and major A road out of town
There is absolutely nothing wrong with the English language

Some of the most commonly used words in the English language that we use every single day come directly from Old Norse brought over from Norway, Denmark with the Viking invasions/conquest/settlement from 800s-1000s etc
I pronounce it 'ost rail ee a'
"Damn Scots, ruined Scotland" - Willie from the simpsons
The stereotype is that it’s poverty-ridden
Northern Spain (and northern Portugal as well) is so different from what we traditionally associate with Spain
I remember a road trip I did from Madrid coming from Burgos into Asturias thought I’d accidentally entered Wales, it’s so green and Misty
People as well I think are slightly more reserved - that’s not to say less friendly though and the landscape is absolutely stunning
As someone who works with 80% Romanians, i agree with you
Portsmouth - Historic Dockyard, the most famous ship there is HMS Victory, the flagship of Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson, and the oldest commissioned navy ship in the world
(Not sure if a ship can be a **land**mark tho lol
Picture:  [
I'm from Nottingham and I can't really pick a single landmark but the standouts would be:
- [Nottingham Castle] there's not much remaining of the original fortifications which were built in 1068 as there's been a fair amount of battles in the area but there's a 1600 mansion that has been built within the former structure
- [Wollaton Hall] a 1580 Elizabethan country house that was key in driving architectural trends, deer roam the surrounding parkland despite the whole ground being surrounded by the city which is quite quaint
- [Nottingham Council House] completed in 1929 which is quite recent compared to others but it forms as the main centerpiece of the city in the middle of Old Market Square
I’m from Bristol, where we have the Clifton Suspension Bridge, which was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel
Coventry  has 2 old churches, some old city walls from the Civil War , and a old cathedral ruins
Huh
I wonder if that's where the word "Mattock" comes from
Is this where we get the english word mallet
So, same PIE root potentially
Down south-east*
As a midlander, this is all too expected
Midlands erasure is real
u/All-Shall-Kneel didn’t. And, with respect, most of you wants to leave the UK anyways (which is totally your call
Frankly I’m jealous)
Plus they could just be talking about their country specifically
Like you could answer what Scotland would be like if northern Scots swapped with Southern Scots
Then where I’m from - Nottingham, in the East Midlands - would likely be north-aligned
But no Northerner accepts Nottingham as northern
Not that I’d want to be
Midlander 4 lyf yo
odd that they’d remember england, wales and northern ireland but not scotland
Fair enough
A lot can change in 6 years
Its generally frowned upon unless you're on a nature trail or its past 10 and everyones hamerred
You will get fined £90 if the police catch you though
>  Europe because of its proximity to Italy
odd, pasta is popular because its good grub, not proximity, after all Indian/Pakistani cuisine is probably the most popular in the UK and its origin is far away
Fucking Americans man
>On the other hand, Erasmus students tend to be a bunch with a whole lot of people not being the sharpest knives in the drawer
Also, lots of people who never lived away from home and only lived in student lodgings where your food is cooked for you (which is also amusing and bothering to me
I find it depends, the problem is the attitude of students in different countries can be very different
In the UK, at my university, they tend to work harder than we do imho
English students have a stinking attitude if we go on Erasmus, because the marks often do not count towards our degree classification, and generally speaking English students (especially those from non top universities, speaking as someone who goes to a middle ranked uni) tend to have a very relaxed approach as it is
I like eating actual food at least half the time, so I try and cook properly, made a Pasta All'amatricana last night following a recipe from an Italian chef which was good, the problem is when it comes to European food, or even Italian food, English parents don't make it properly themselves, so the students are even worse
My mum buys the cheapest £0
20p for 500g Pasta because 'all pasta is the same', and then puts a load of sauce and cheddar cheese on it, I only eat her British food tbh
Luckily she is vegetarian, so I don't 'experience' the infamous British 'Carbonara' with double cream and bacon (it's just wrong, trust me)
My high school used to serve massively overcooked- pasta with baked beans as a sauce and cheddar cheese on top
Judging from what I've seen online, having separate taps for hot and cold water
For new year last year I spent it with my gf's family in Ukraine
And my gf's dad's gf was really protective about me and the cold, as its technically the first time I've been somewhere -10c was common
Like sure it was cold but it was bareable, and as long as you had a jumper and a windproof layer it was comfortable
She then explained how I wouldn't be able to cope with a Belarussian winter as its much colder than even Ukraine and is regularly -30c or less, and us brits cant deal with the cold
I explained that while technically colder it didn't feel that way
This November my gf's dad and his gf stayed in Belfast
She messaged me later explaining she was sorry, and claimed Belfast is the coldest place on earth
I felt that was a big win
What's the ball made of
Looks like catching that after someone has given it an almighty whack would hurt like a bugger
This is true to some extent for England as well, I think mainly the north of England though
Normal here as well
Can't imagine how that would be weird
>Getting out of the bed in the morning was an effort
My student house is an old Victorian property with the bathroom downstairs
In the depth of winter it takes a lot of mental strength to get out of bed and make that long journey downstairs to the shower through the cold
Especially when I'm in my underwear
Sounds like you were stalling it, the engines are not supposed to shut off every time you stop
You’re supposed to push down the clutch and brake when you stop, if you just push the brake, the engine cuts out
Did you seriously drive round starting the engine up every time you came to a stop
> I still didn't get the point of the tiny roundabouts (with three exits) when people just treated them as normal junctions
Normally it's because there's been a lot of accidents at that junction so they turn it into a mini roundabout so people are more likely to slow down and give way to their right
Hm I'm from England and never heard of this
I guess it's a regional thing
I wouldn't think it was weird if someone did but it's not like a *thing* if you get me
Moonrakers is objectively the best roundabout in the world, purely because no one knows how it works so just plows through it and we had to drive through it every time I went to my nans as a kid so it brings back happy memories
Also its a bit fucking odd to be nostalgic for a roundabout, but eh what else is there to miss
I know what you mean
It's not a done thing like turkey dinner, Queen's speech, pulling crackers etc but I don't think anybody would raise eyebrows at it
No certainly not
As an English speaker from England, this seems surreal to me
Don't even have spelling bees in England (as far as I know), which is rather confusing in my opinion
Yeah same here in England
We do have them but not as common as in America, nor as big

Relatively speaking, that's cheap as fuck
Norfolk: Inbred
Suffolk: Inbred
Yorkshire: Inbred

Rest of London: brown people, knife crime
Home counties: Brexit voting hardcore Tories who all play cricket
Never seen a brown person in real life
Black Country: farmers with pirate accents

Norfolk: inbred morons
Yorkshire: a country within a country
Think Yorkshire is the best place on Earth but I've never actually heard any of them explain how
They describe Yorkshire as 'God's Own Country' which is arrogant and quite baffling
Liverpool: thieves, football mad, poor
Lancashire: rugby loving pie-shaggers
Manchester: London North who like to think they're as working class as Liverpool
North Wales: Welsh speaking, caravans, holidays for poor people
South Wales: cuckolds for the English although they probably see themselves in the mold of the rebellious Scots (they aren't, last Welsh rebellion was 600 years ago)
Lowland Scots: rowdy, dour, stingy English haters (except Edinburgh, which is where the 10 existing posh Scots reside)
Highland Scots: kilt wearing, red-haired, still live in stone huts

- Lowlanders are low-key xenphobes who won't tell you to your face, but just avoid you
- Everyone from Edinburgh is either incredibly wealthy or incredibly poor
- Glaswegians are *constantly* drunk
- Highlanders and Islanders are uncivilised savages

Since when are Tykes considered inbred, and by whom
Norfolk sure, but they know the rest of the country consider them inbred

You don’t think people in other countries have _tea bags_?

I've never been to Ireland and was planning to go in 2020 (before covid had happened) I had no idea how expensive accommodation is there

Lovebyte, I feel like you're trying to be sold an electric bike

There’s just no point in voting for labour in a Tory safe seat and vice versa so you end up either effectively wasting your vote or voting for someone you don’t want in power

Anything to do with maypoles seems to be dying as does various border lands maypole things as they used to cover themselves in coal as a 'disguise' but it look too much like blackface to be acceptable now
We used to celebrate 'harvest' when I was in school but I think this has become less common
When I moved to London I noticed that Bonfire Night isn’t really celebrated here
Back where I’m from in the East Midlands it’s a yearly tradition and pretty much every pub in the area will have a bonfire and fireworks if they have the space
There's still events you can go to, but I havent seen anyone doing Penny for the Guy since the 90s.
Also, you get a lot of people complaining about at home firework displays upsetting their pets
Alcohol tax has slowly killed the british pub too

The Hall of the Mountain King has been one of my favourite pieces of music since I was a little kid
So so good
Land of Hope and Glory, and Jerusalem
Both would be better national anthems than the dirge we have now
I mean this in the least contentious and non-argumentative manner possible, but I know a bunch of people who cite the same reasons for not liking God Save The Queen, but ignore them when it comes to Jerusalem, and I just do not understand
I’m an atheist and a republican; I dislike GSTQ for those reasons, and similarly Jerusalem for it’s religiosity
How can you say you don’t like GSTQ because you don’t believe in God but give Jerusalem a pass
Personally I wouldn’t want either as my national anthem, but hey ho
Wagner being an anti-Semitic kinda puts a pretty big downer on *Ride* of the Valkyries
Mind if I ask why you associate it with the north
The bands from Surrey and Paul Weller wrote it about their hometown
Well yeah, I think Jerusalem is _better_ than God Save the Queen
God Save The Queen literally doesn’t even mention England
But Jerusalem still frames the love of our country in terms of Christianity, which I just cannot get past, especially since the majority of the country has been irreligious for a good few years now
I dunno
I just can’t abide it
I have no interest in religion whatsoever and I don’t like that English patriotism always has to be couched in either Christianity, monarchism, or football
Yeah, I’ll give it that
IIRC Carthago also means New City in Phoenician, and the Romans called *the Carthaginian's colony in Hispania "Carthago Nova", so literally New New City
edit* re-worded the sentence for clarification
I have very little shared history with many of the peoples of Europe
Our journey to where we are politically is not shared
I therefore do not see myself as part of the same "demos" as them
Therefore I wouldn't not like to pool my electoral power with them as they have very different interests to my own and may support laws which are not desired by my country
culture is a delicate thing that requires a certain level of management
people cannot trust the EU to be able to micromanage every culture if it were to become a large government
with freedom of movement, cultures may become overshadowed by foreign cultures because swathes of people who were apparently from their country (across europe) have entered their nation freely
they want a national government that represents their individual values or at least a party that is adapted to their national characteristics, as we have now
under a united EU these cultural differences that affect politics and necessitate different policy would be ignored and, because it's such an enormous government, they would be painted with the same broad strokes as the rest of europe
under one country there would be a sentiment of unity, even if it's not 100% mutual
enabled by freedom of movement, culture would flow around europe, eventually standardising a sterilised, diluted "european" culture — every national identity requires a culture
under a united EU a "french" (ie
intense) demonstration in paris would be treated the same as one in berlin, or madrid, or dublin — culture is the cost of unity
you would not be treated differently (ie
like how your government treat it) because a government in a different country controlling you could not truly understand your cultural and political differences
Shouldn't the Constitution of the Weimar Republic prevented the takeover
The fact that 'currently the EU had a veneer of protecting national culture' does not mean that once power is centralised that those policies will remain eternal
It comes from a distrust of where things could go once that power is centralised, not how things are right now
>I'd bet that it's not an action that the federal government of the EU would take
Eurosceptics wouldn't. That's the issue
>As for independence, what is it exactly
Loool
Ask a Latvian
>Why do you trust the British government to protect your individual rights
It does now, and it has in the past, but why do you extend that to the future
Because we have a system which has been continuous for 400 years, mate
We are in the top few most politically stable countries in Europe
I choose not to pool my democracy with countries which have only been countries (let alone democracies) for a few decades
No thanks
The EU is too much too soon for me
You're right that it would need a strong Constitution though
I don't trust the people who would be writing it that they would do so with the protection of the interests of the individual nations
I'm glad we're out and good luck to the EU
I would agree on that particular issue
What often happens instead of banning (happened in the UK) is that it became the official language of church and state, meaning that all business was conducted in that language
Over time this resulted in the erosion of native languages, but it took hundreds of years (and in Ireland's case a terrible famine)
Just a silly question
"What is independence" is a strange comment coming from a country occupied so much in it's history
Thought you might value independence more
>... and Brexit is showing precisely that
Brexit is absolutely the largest schism we've seen in our politics since the 20s and 30s.
Compare that with what has happened in your country in the last 100 years and it seems little greater than a family squabble
>The EU is not changing to anything until the citizens decide to do so, but if you don't like its current state, sure
Are you stating there aren't dozens of constitutional matters that the citizens of the EU would reject if put to popular vote
That's brave
I don't believe the European Commission is solely interested in what the people of Europe want
>Why wouldn't you trust them
They would be citizens of those same countries, representing their citizens
They are not aliens sent by who knows what to destroy the European countries
They would be citizens not any different from the current MEPs or folks at Westminster
And they would be subject to the exact same democratic mandate of every other political representative, they wouldn't get to do whatever
So, really, why the distrust
Don't really get this argument
Sylvio Berlesconi is just a citizen of his country
So is Viktor Orban
Both were democratically elected but not people *you personally* would like writing your Constitution
The European Commission is not elected by the citizens of Europe
I have very little doubt the people like Ursuala von der Leyen and JCJ will be the types actually writing it
I just do not feel part of a European Demos
Right
So what you're saying is independence is a sliding scale
Becoming part of a federal nation would be further towards the "not independent" end of the scale
>The difference between being in a federal EU and a British empire, is that the EU sees you as an equal participant, not an unruly subject with the wrong religion, and is willing to provide aid should it be necessary
As well as having an actual say in what's going on, and the knowledge that you chose to enter the agreement without a foreign army knocking on your front door
The British Empire ended 60 years ago
Get over it
> independence is a meaningless word on its own
Sounds like the sort of thing Hitler or Stalin would say
I'm not saying that's your sympathy, but to many of us, and I'm sure to many Latvians, independence is fairly simple to understand
I do have time, but some days are more rushed than others
It depends on lifestyle, my boss for instance will work until 2am so I doubt he’s doing well
I have a good meal and adequate sleep about 80% of the time I think
I’m trying to improve my work life balance as much as possible, but sometimes when work has to be done I do lose out
It’s worse for those in the city where expectations for longer hours are higher
My firm is trying to improve our mental health and work life balance so I feel like i’m able to stop and not work myself to the bone like others feel like they must
I’m an accountant for reference
London is def the most foreign due to it being soooo different to the rest of the country
Most typical would probably be somewhere like Nottingham
I live in London which is probably the most foreign feeling city because there are so many immigrants from all over the world, but i have lived here all my life so I am probably use to it and underestimating it
London is also a pretty huge city so some parts may feel more foreign than other parts
I'd say the most typical city i have been to would be Bath
It's pretty famous for its roman baths (no pun intended) yet still feels very english and uniquely typical
Might get some heat for this, but actually London
(Feels least like England) 90% of the people that I walk past aren’t speaking English, there are shops you won’t find anywhere else in the UK, cars you won’t ever see anywhere else in the UK (at least very few)
I looked it up on google maps and 'lenin statue' was a landmark listed on there
I can't imagine there's too many of them in Norway
I'd second London, I don't feel like it's *my* capital when I'm there, it just feels like a behemoth of a city that everybody from all over knows and lives in, genuinely feel like a tourist there
As for normal, I guess Sheffield for me as its where I grew up and just feels like an average interior British city
Yeah I saw the question and was like “oh I _wonder_ what everyone is going to say” lol
90% not speaking English is total bullshit FYI
Pls I dont want 20CHF pizzas ptsd
Maybe as a percentage but in London you have very different communities in one city
Like in Edgeware road there is a large Arab community, lots of Jews in Stamford hill and a massive Japanese community i use to live near (i forgot the name)
There is a small Chinatown here too
I'd say yes a lot of London does look like your classic english city but there are a lot of foreign communities
But then again i have never been to Milton Keynes
Yeah it does seem like the rest of Europe isnt aware that other cities exist in the UK even though some of these cities are big enough to completely dwarf many other European capitals
What is crazy is that I have had the same damn conversation with so, so, so, so, so many other Euopeans who have moved to London to 'learn English' for a year or whatever whilst they work in bar or something and all of them complain about how expensive 'England' is and all this chat just totally unaware there is a massive country outside of London and that the reason their rent is so expensive is because of the huge number of people wanting to do the exact same thing as them
Ok thanks for correcting me
What’s the actual percentage according to rottenox
I obviously don’t mean that, if I meant an actual figure I would have quoted a statistics website, I’ll change what I said to the *majority* of people I pass by
Note the “I” as in my experience, not yours or other Londoners
90% is just my experience, hence why I put “I” and not “Londoners”. That is an interesting way of interpreting the question
What would your answer have been if that’s the case
salty boi
True, in terms of architecture London isn't very significant
Here and there you might get a foreign styled building but for the most part it's not special compared to the rest of England
I’d rather be salty than flavourless
Reasons for: a lot of Europeans speak it already
Reasons against: it makes no sense
not romansch but romansch cause its a weird mix between french, german and italian
It would please everyone and no-one
I agree, spanish is so easy in comparison to other european languages
> You need a rational langage
Which is why you cant have a language that assigns genders to inanimate objects
Pronunciation is what
I've struggled with togliere for years
Surely a monosalybic language with much fewer sylabils is easier
Really
I've spent the past couple of years trying to lose my English accent while speaking German and only now do I find out that Germans find it cute
The hours i've wasted:(
Indeed, I have done this before
One of my housemates is Bulgarian and I wouldn't say that her accent is scary per-se, but I have definitely heard some very scary sounding Slavic accents before haha
Heard about this little thing called Brexit
I'd say bankrupting your country by spending half of your wealth on opening a banana stall on the coast of Panama is up there as well
Maybe if you hadn't ballsed that up you wouldn't have had to have spent the last three hundred years moaning about how oppressed you are by the English
No, but the atrocities we’ve committed were intentional
I don’t think many people wanted Brexit to be going this badly
Cold: Yes
Chilly: Yes
Nice: No
Warm: No
Hot: No
Personally: (celsius)
These are all approximate, I haven't put much thought into it
Cold: - -5
Chilly: -4 - 10
Nice: 11 - 22
Warm: 23 - 32
Hot: 33+
I think most Brits would agree with this
If you like grey skies and rain come on over
That's me right now
4c but it's wet outside and I didn't really dress as well as I should for it and it's freezing
Actually nursing a cup of tea and some stroopwafels right now
Just checked and I live at 51° north, so that just about qualifies me haha
It's not that bad
The sun sets at about 15:50 where I am at the moment and it can be a bit depressing but you deal with it, especially when it's all you've ever known
It's gradual anyway, and it means we also in turn get longer days in summer
You just have to put up with it
Here it only come light at about 8 in the morning and starts going dark at about 4
But if we didn't have this we wouldn't have the long summer days when it comes light at 4am and stays light until 11pm
I'm 53 degrees north
I mean, I'm only 53 north, but honestly, I dont deal with it
You can only get used to the sun rising at 9am and setting at 4pm, which I know isn't as bad as some other places but I still hate it-
Sun rises about 8 here but goes down around the same time
Why is that a plot hole
That was about the size of my university and everyone sort of new OF everyone
Wild
How is it an anomaly
First one that came to my mind as well
I love Lazio’s tbf
Love the blue and the eagle in the top
Also side note
I love both Fortitudo and Virtus Bologna’s logos for pallacanestro LBA
As a City fan, i cannot say ive enjoyed the sight of this logo
Stop this silly business of fining people for crossing an empty road when it's perfectly safe to do so
Take back the streets from the automobile and empower pedestrians again
Let's make it so jaywalking isn't a crime anywhere on this continent
Does racism count
Sensible folk
Is Helikopter preferred over Hubschrauber
Interesting
I'm fluent but nailing down register without actually living somewhere is hard
Lived in London for 4 years and only really ever went to some of the main museums once or twice (British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Science Museum)
Also never visited the Tower of London or Tower Bridge
I've been to the Houses of Parliament once (when I was younger and lived outside of London
It was pretty cool because we watched Prime Minister's Questions from the gallery above the House of Commons)
Other than that I frequently got bored in London
I was glad to leave and moved to Bath where I had a much better time
Grew up in the West country and didn't see Stone Henge till I was about 23
> you can't go right up to the stones
That's a privilege only allowed for the likes of Neil Oliver as he wonders around Stonehenge touching and rubbing up the stones, looking all pensive as he epic monologues about what it all means/the reasons for and why Stonehenge was built/the context and the society and culture of the people who built it/why it's so important in the big picture of history and how Stonehenge relates to modern Brits and modern Britain and our national story etc etc all accompanied by very beautiful cinematic shots and pretty vistas with haunting, atmospheric music playing
I went to the Sacré-Cœur quite early in the morning and although the crypt wasn’t open, it was very nice as it was almost empty
Elephant and hippopotamus I remember learning at school
Just to throw a spanner in the works; The most useful education to get here is not a degree but a trade
There is a massive shortage of plumbers, electricians, builders, bricklayers, carpenters here that many of them can charge rates that are far far far higher than most graduate jobs
Essentially in the 90s the government had the idea that *everyone* should go to university and have pushed the idea that either you go to uni or you dont get a 'real job' so hard working kids have been deterred from learning trades thus creating a massive shortage
Computer Science degrees in the UK are totally fucked on the job market now, almost as bad as most humanities degrees
Of course, as with everywhere else in Europe, the best bet by far is STEM degrees, with the caveat that Medicine in the UK pays far far worse than in the USA, but has worse conditions than a lot of countries in Europe (eg compared to France, the workload is way higher)
Therefore, the best bet is Engineering related degrees, unless you go to a really elite university, **in the UK, the type of university you went to is more important than the degree itself
** At Oxford for example, if you study Law and do well, you are setting yourself up for a very high salary indeed (potentially £90,000 starting salary), but if you did law at most of the newer uni, you'll be working in a supermarket
At the really poorly regarded unis, the best degrees for employment are ones tied to industry, eg construction management
I mean I went to a not very well regarded new university and have a graduate Civil Service job, but I'm the only guy in my entire graduating class of 2020 with a grad job so far
You say that like all graduate jobs are mentally stimulating
>But you have very little social prestige
I'm sorry, what
Please expand on that comment you utter pig headed snob
In the UK, it it is just a BA, and historically people could do it with a diploma (Assoc degree, my mother did that 10 years ago or so) or even with no university qualification earlier than that (was even possible to be a nurse without a uni qual about 40 years ago, my mum did that too lol)
Pay as a social worker in the UK is really really bad though, social work grads on average earn less than many Arts and Humanities disciplines
> It's pretty clear that a bricklayer and a professor don't hold the same social status in society, regardless of how much either are earning
By whom
You mean other academics
And this matters why
You think the wealthy bricklayers kids wont be allowed into the private school that that professors kids cant afford to go without assistance
You know its not the 1950s anymore, right
Your profession holds little to no regard over your status when compared with how you carry yourself
Pantomimes
> Well, sticking with the food theme, I think salatpizza, which is a pizza with döner kebab, iceberg, tomatoes, cucumber slices and creme fraiche dressing, is unique to Denmark, or at least Scandinavia
Fuck, I've been looking for this my whole life
I have a memory of having a pizza in Denmark with a white sauce and salad on it but I never had any idea what it was
Always wanted to have it again, it was so delicious
We also have Dandelion & Burdock, Vimto, Lilt, Karibbean Kola, Tizer and Tango
Belgium, colonising and ruining central Africa since 1918
**badly
I'm glad you see it
Drives me insane
It's like, come on Scots, let's just take responsibilty for the shit we did together
It's like we commited a huge crime spree together and when it gets to court they all of a sudden had not part and it was all our idea
Yep
The settlement of Ulster was promoted as a shared pursuit between the English and the Scottish
Just a fun thing to do together
That’s why so many unionist Northern Irish groups have the Scottish flag as one of their symbols
The Scots were well up for the whole Empire thing as well
Many, many colonial administrators, generals etc were Scottish
Many Irish too actually
Lots of Jewish people put money in swiss banks before and during the war as it was seen as a safe  place to put it
After the war many swiss banks just kept it, resisting payment with intransigence and bureaucracy
When some family members tried to withdraw the money they were told they needed to provide death certificates of for their family members
who died in the holocaust
Lindisfarne massacre of 793, England will never forget
To be fair it was done after we beat the Scots, so it wasn’t exactly the same, but many Scottish leaders were more than happy to join in
The settlement of Ulster was split pretty much 50/50  between the English and Scottish
For all the ways that Scotland has been oppressed by the English, a lot of people, Scots and non-Scots alike have no idea (or just ignore) how much Scotland benefited from the British Empire
> Yep
The settlement of Ulster was promoted as a shared pursuit between the English and the Scottish
Just a fun thing to do together
Just a cute little bonding activity
It's just young Scots to be honest
The ald ones love all of that empire stuff; bagpipes, thin red lines, kilts and all of that shit
Dunno, but I hope we get to burn the white House down again for the banter
You're not the only one who read it with that tune my friend
You got yourselves into this when you tried to colonise the Darien Gap, fall in line
More beer, I realize it’s too early and beer is basically liquid bread anyways
After four beers I'll go home and go to bed, it's not that much
After eight beers, I'd either get a döner kebab in a pitta bread with salad, or fried chicken, or I would go home and make an enormous toasted sandwich that could easily feature on /r/stupidfood
11:45 is kind of early but it's also believable - in the UK we might go to the pub and start drinking in the afternoon or early evening
For England(and it's extremely London centric as historically that's where the big, nation defining building have been built and are located, when it comes to these things, things are not very spread out in England, London has been and is the beating heart of the country, it dominates national life), and so in no particular order

Being from Italy is cheating
The Forum, Rome
I'm English, from semi rural yorkshire and cycle the 10 mile round trip to work every day
I ride a non suspension mountain bike, probably be called a gravel bike these days
I live in an area that was once known for its coal production  so this means there are 1000s of miles of trails that used to be train tracks
It's much safer than the road although do probably ride a good 35% on the road and it's somthing iv done all my life so iv always been used to it
Not sure why you would be veering out of your lane, you can easily ride a bike in a straight line
Cycling is not as seamless as it appears
Many drivers hate cyclists, others are far too nervous and that can be just as dangerous
As long as you do a little defensive riding and keep your eyes well peeled and being sensible will make the journey much safer
Sometimes just because you have right of way does not mean you should take it
I commute via bike in London and here its a mix of road bikes and hybrid bike
Personally I use a road bike as I also cycle as a sport
Completely off topic does "An European" sound wrong to anyone else
I know it's grammatically correct to use an before AEIOU but I want to say a european
No^just^me
I strongly dislike dogs, so I guess in that sense  I'm not particularly European
and possibly 1651-1660
Ah yes, the famous Dutch conquest of England
I feel like almost all the answers here are because the people visiting had little to no idea of what the city is like and just made up some ridiclious steryotype
Oh youre surprised London one the busiest and most expensive cities in the world is busy and expensive and not some sleepy picturesque image of olde England, shocking
Oh Berlin isn't full of ancient buildings and history after being totally flattened in the 40s? Colour me shocked
Oh Milan an industrial business centre isn't a quiet Tuscan town with romantic images of charming Italy
Heavens no
Oh Paris in 2019 looks very different to how it looked in 1930s French art house cinema
How dare they change it
For me Milan
I love Italy but Milan just had no charm
Marseille
Apart from the Vieux Port area of the city the whole place was a dump with questionable characters loitering around
Cardiff
Whole city smelt of piss and 90% of the restaurants ranked 3/5 or lower on Hygiene, according to the official signs in the windows
Most major European cities, as a Londoner I thought they would be more well, foreign
Once you take out the touristy bits most cities just feel like cities, very similar vibe
New York
Hot, expensive and full of crackheads
Took a trip around Italy, I was most looking forward to Venice but it was over hyped for me (and honestly the worst stop on my trip)
I fucking loved Palermo in the same way I love my friends that I only see when I wanna get fucked up, it's chaotic and dirty as shit and gave me horrific food poisoning
Sorrento
Disappointed is a strong word, its a gorgeous place, but the food wasn't as good as I expected it to be
To be fair it's quite resorty and anywhere like that tends to be a letdown on the food side
St Petersburg for me
Everything just looked the same
I much prefer Moscow and Kazan
Dublin just feels like an overpriced, not particularly great city in the UK
I just wouldn't consider Dublin to be a major European city
Its pretty small and has never really been the centre of anything thats not almost totally related to Ireland
At the end of the day every European capital cant be 'major'.
Basically if you're in Rome or Florence and an African guy comes up saying something, asking to give you something, commenting on something you're wearing, keep walking
My point being everyone expects all Italian cities to somehow be Siena or something
Less hype for there though
As I said, you cant class every capital city as a major city
Dublin has half a million people, its on the edge of Europe, it has no major industry, port or EU based parliament
Sorry but you're going to have put your pride aside and admit the in terms of being a major city Dublin is not in the same leagues as; Paris, London, Berlin, Madrid, Munich, Moscow, Rome,
but its like one of the lesser things to see in London
I dont think any British person would say 'oh London, make sure you see big ben'. Just weird that when you're saying the reason you dont like London you're listing one of the more boring aspects about it
It'd be like me saying; Oh i didnt like Berlin, the Fernsehturm is kinda dull
If you just want to see tall things why didnt you just turn around and look at The Shard then
Reading your comments here it strikes me that you like old traditional cities but didnt visit a single city in the UK thats on the tourist trail
Did you just not do any research before your trip
Perhaps come back and hit Oxford, Cambridge, Bath, York, Winchester, Durham, Edinburgh, and the Clifton area of Bristol
Did you go to Clifton in Bristol, Im guessing as you're Spanish your friend lived in Stokes Croft or St Pauls which aren't exactly the prettiest areas of the city
Great drugs though
I'm surprised at the response, but then it is London
I've never really heard it asked for,  but you'd probably annoy the bartender if you did
Typically all the house spirits are the same price,  so you'd get a follow up question along the lines of 'Light rum, dark rum, vodka, whisky or gin
My son learnt about Celts, Angles and Saxons when he was 7 or 8
...and we use Arabic numerals, Greek philosophy, and Egyptian and Chinese technologies too, but they don't receive as much focus
That Roman culture had an influence on British culture -- or any other European culture for that matter -- doesn't ipso facto prove its importance
Plenty of cultures have had influences
It is suppose to be pronounced as "aitch" but a lot of people pronounce it as "haich".
I was always taught aych as being more proper than haytch, so it's what I've learned to say
For reference I'm kinda midlands-south east and still in school
French is my second language and while I do this somewhat intuitively, I didn't really understand this was a rule per se until today (disclaimer: I have a Quebec accent in French)
Thank you
Plenty of us in the UK that say haitch tbf
Aitch is more "proper".
really
I allays viewed it as more common
Perhaps it's a class thing and the boundaries have shifted
I was going to say that, down South, it means that you didn't get the memo properly in school, but then on the other hand, it's an aitch in the proper Cockney accent isn't it
Perhaps it started to be taught as haitch in comps to try to stop the h dropping in Cockney and other similar working class accents, and that became irrelevant/unnecessary as Estuary English emerged
As a gay person there’s a few I would think twice about visiting
I’ll certainly never go to places like Russia or Belarus, and even places like Poland and Croatia are starting to look ever more hostile
Why would I visit a place that declares huge regions to be ‘LGBT-free’ or that burns effigies of gay couples
It’s terrifying
Fuck that
Other than that, I would potentially visit any European nation
Sure, there are places I want to visit more than others, but outside of feeling personally unsafe, I would check out any country
I do want to make it my mission to visit every country in europe because it's a decent and achievable challenge unlike trying to visit every country in the world
But countries I have absolutely no interest in visiting would be belarus, maldova and macedonia
Just ignore them
I mean, that is true, everyone shits on us, especially right now
I hate it
But crucially, it’s not like it’s coming from no where, is it
Wow, if there was one country I didn’t think would appear on this list, Ireland would be it
Everyone usually wanks themselves silly over Ireland
That answer was so
French
Sorry, how is the UK in the same group as those three
That doesn’t make sense
What kind of fool thinks the UK is a dictatorship
You could say the same about many big european cities
Paris for instance is much worse than London for rubbish and criminals
But being the Yorkshireman I am, I’m happy to hear you prefer the north
I live in London and I fuuuuuuuucking love it
Also, midlands erasure
It was when I went
Man, I am appalled by anti-immigrant prejudice but do not compare the two
Thanks man
: D
I mean sure, but as an English person talking to a Scottish person, don’t you think part of it is just because Ireland is very similar to Britain in many ways
It’s literally one of the world’s top travel destinations
All very true
I mean I have been to Dublin so I might have a bit more awareness than you, but while it was a nice trip to a great city, it was a very similar experience to visiting various great cities in Britain
Least we have tourists
Says who
I heard about it
I think the reason it got less coverage than the NZ shooting was likely the number of people killed (50 is a lot more than 10), the fact that it happened in another english speaking country, and that it was anti-muslim
Nope didn’t hear about it until you just said it now
It made the news here, yes, but it was like a brief mention
Then the Christchurch shooting happaned and the Brazil school shooting was not mentioned after
What school shooting
Also, it can go beyond reasonable force if the assailant attacks you in your house
But it can’t be grossly disproportionate force
Even then - when Mary I married Philip II of Spain, Parliament were very clear that this was a personal union only, dissolved on either one's death: Philip held no power in England and any children of the marriage would be heirs only to the throne of England, not Spain
He was basically to be a regal sperm donor
Nottingham
Originally ‘Snotingaham’, meaning “the home of Snot’s people”, with Snot being the name of an Anglo-Saxon chieftain
My city is named after a guy called Snot
Bristol
Now Bristol is both a city and a county
It has many possible etymologies/name origins, and nobody is certain which is correct
The word may come from the Old English Anglo-Saxon "Brycgstow", meaning the "place at the bridge". Although even earlier recorded place names in the Bristol area include the Roman-era British Brythonic-Celtic word "Abona" (derived from the name of the Avon) and the archaic Welsh "Caer Odor" ("fort on the chasm") that 'chasm' most likely refering to [Avon Gorge] I digress, but the archaic Welsh "Caer Odor" which may have been calqued as the modern English Clifton(which actually is an area in Bristol near Avon Gorge)
Also as mentioned the origin of Bristol again might go back further to Celtic Britain times, drawing on the Celtic words 'braos' and 'tuile' etc meaning to describe 'a stream through a chasm'... It's one of those two either Saxon or Celtic, but we just don't know which one
But considering Bristol's geographic location right nextdoor to Wales, it's Celtic British origin as a major settlement, said chasm etc etc
Making an educated guess im going with the Welsh/Brythonic British Celtic origin for the name Bristol
The Saxons most likely just adopted that already existing name for the settlement when they came on the scene
York comes eventually from the Roman Eboracum (which *may* come from a Celtic *Eburas, but the Romans were the first to settle)
"Ebor" for short became Eoforwic to the Anglo-Saxons, then Jorvik to the Vikings, then gradually into York
My hometown is [Walton] in Somerset, England
The name comes from the settlement/farmstead of the Wealas (Native Celts)
The first part of the word is Old English, Wahl, and can mean ‘foreigner’, ‘Briton’. Ton is Old English for ‘estate/enclosure’. Wiki suggests the Wealas continued living/farming there and took on the culture of the Anglo Saxons to climb the social ladder (as was the case for many places) and as such forgot their language
Southampton just means south by the river I believe
They should change it back for a laugh
This is really interesting, I visited two years ago and thought it was lovely
Bit embarrassed I was pronouncing it incorrectly
It’s just like purrrrrrrr (rolled r)
No longer accurate to say all the top universities are Russel Group, some pretty average universities like Southampton are in there too
LSE significantly stronger than LBS, if you are doing economics or finance, it's an equal or better to Oxford or Cambridge
Also the full name of LSE is London School of Economics and Political Science, so it's very very good for Political Science, though not the equal of Oxford or Cambridge in that anymore imho
Kings
Would add Sciences Po to that list too, one of the best places for Politics in the world
Yeah, and I'm saying its in the Russell Group but not what I would consider an 'elite uni'
I think it's much the same in England
I can't speak for the rest of the UK, but there's not much - if anything - here that I'm aware of
Even famous creatures like elves or giants are other cultures' folklore, not ours
Not a film bur Breaking Bad wouldn't have made sense because he would have had his treatment paid for on the NHS
In Bruges wouldn't work because Bruges isn't in England
German Highways are a different story
But
The Witcher's real
That's set in Poland
When the guy speaking English as a second language knows more cromulent words than you do
And UK
Don't forget we use miles too
Get some flair mate
That day is miles away
Daytime running lights
What do you mean
Driving on the other side is pretty easy
Can only be challenging if youre doing it in a British car
I wish we were the same as them, too
Time for them to start driving on the left
Switzerland also has a different plug, it's like the rest of the EU but with an earth pin and hardly any travel adapters support it
Tom Scott did a video on it
Ah, yeah UK is same as Germany

You can usually tell that by whether it's moving or not

Just sharing a fun fact of the day for any folks out there who might be reading this thread is all
Knowledge is power as they say
whether or not to put the milk in first when making a cup of tea
Whether or not you enjoy marmite
Isn't it a bit much to have kefir and smetana together
I like both, but I wouldn't have that much dairy in the same meal
You know that they call them "cobs" round Nottingham way
Fucking lunatics, literally nobody else in the country calls them that
Tea cake
Come at me
My wife sometimes puts the milk in with the teabag
She's foreign and therefore could be excused
However, divorce is an option
On the topic of brown, I tried explaining what Lea & Perrins is to a room full of assorted European coworkers
It proved impossible
Can you explain it
It's got anchovies, but it's not a fish sauce
It's savoury, but also sweet
You put it in a bloody Mary, or on toasted cheese, or in bolognaise
It's something like 150 years old and coincidentally that's how long a single bottle usually lasts
No, it's:
Breakfast, brunch, lunch, tea, dinner, supper
Midnight snack
It's no wonder we're all so obese
Tea is a drink, not a meal
I don't know why this challenges people so much
Oh yeah, and second breakfast
Czech Republic is cool
I've been to Prague (obviously) and also Karlovy Vary which is a break from the crowds
For me it's Germany
I love the lakes and mountains of Bavaria, the abundance of picturesque medieval towns, the food that is great for someone with a sweet tooth like me, Christmas markets, the people etc
I love France, I used to get the ferry every Summer for my family holiday and had so many great times
I’d love to do the same with my kids one day
I love the language and the slightly different culture
It’s beautiful too and quite diverse in landscape
A lot of people only think about Paris, but there’s so much more to see
Wales: I love the history, landscapes (particularly Snowdonia); the friendly people, the architecture
I am in bliss after a long hike up a peak in the Glyderau, relaxing next to the log burner reading a book
There's a feeling of comfort and cosiness that I get straight away as soon as I cross over to Wales that I've never had in England, or any other place
Runner up: Switzerland  I'm fascinated by the Canton system and how well everything (from what I've seen) works
It's also the most immaculately clean country I've visited
It almost doesn't seem real
Yeah France is my other one
I went for the first time in 2001 and we stayed in the Brittany region as well as Normandy (mainly Mont Saint-Michel) and it's all very beautiful
Paris is iconic and there's a lots to do but there's a ridiculous amount of places in the rest of the country worth visiting
And severe apartheid
Wrong word
I meant segregation
yeah I think that's why
Music, literature, the visual arts etc
sometimes I think that a hell of a lot of tourists are there just because of Harry Potter

Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland
His corpse was found guilty of murdering a king, sentenced to death and executed (no, really)
Contemporary historians often consider his actions against Irish Catholics to be genocide
Disgraced Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox
My other thought was David Mellor
But genocide and posthumous execution are a little more extreme than sucking a Spaniard's toes whilst wearing a Chelsea kit
Actually the opposite, moved from England to America for my dads job and for him it hasn’t changed bc his contract basically said he gets the same sick days and stuff if he works in America, but the American sick / vacation day system for people we know is awful in general and in comparison( 2 weeks for vacation 6 Months apart  and >5 sick days where my dad gets 4 weeks vacation whenever he wants in the year and 7 days sick, both excluding holidays ) , but the American work environment itself is a lot more chilled out and he’d say a lot better
Terrible biscuit selection, though
Don't get me wrong you definitely have a better selection for 90% of things but the cookie aisle was literally just variations of cookies, whereas here you have cookies and millions of different types of biscuits
Fuck your oranges
Did you know this prize clown is currently in the running to become prime minister
The depressing likelihood is that he's going to come second to an even bigger gusset botherer called Boris Johnson
Such as
To be fair, you did give condolences to the Nazis when Hitler killed himself
yeah it was adolf hitler and the nazis were already beaten, i don't think the nazis were in any position to get mad that the irish didn't send a card
wait are you being sarcastic now
you mean the japanese who also surrendered a few months later and who never had the ability to threaten europe in any way
edit: it's not like hitler wouldn't have just invaded ireland if the uk had fallen anyway
my point is that there was no need for ireland to send condolences for hitler dying due to supposed neutrality when there was absolutely no chance of ireland facing repercussions for doing so
this is a lot of words to say a bunch of stuff that i don't disagree with and im unsure where you got the impression that i do
all i've said is that sending condolences to nazi germany is an incredibly hilariously dumb thing to do when they would've faced absolutely no downsides for not doing so
>are we going to start calling all of the other countries who were neutral and who’s politicians also signed the book Nazis too
i mean in a broad sense these countries could be called nazi sympathisers so sure
>I think it’s totally wrong to say that neutral countries sympathised with Nazis, that completely defeats the purpose of neutrality
they literally sent sympathies to the nazis so they're nazi sympathisers by definition

One of my favourite phrases is “suck it and see”, which just means to try something new to find out if you like it or if it’s effective
“Steve invited me to his birthday outing, but I’m not sure if I’ll enjoy go-karting
I guess I’ll just have to suck it and see
The actual definition is quite innocent but obviously the connotations are delightfully filthy
So bawdy and suggestive
Very British indeed
Huh, maybe one of those is common to German
There's a Rammstein lyric in *Rosenrot* which goes:
> Tiefe Wasser sind nicht still
Or, deep water is not still
I never really understood the allegorical meaning until now
Hence *Dara O'Brien: Craic Addict*
Is that like the English "half baked" meaning a person or idea which is crazy
A few apples short of a picnic
Not the baker's dozen
On my lock screen I have a picture of Morrissey, who is my favourite singer
On my main background I always have a picture of the last player to make a Test century for England
With the whole virus thing it hasn't been changed in a while, and it is still [this picture of Ollie Pope]
It’s a random DOOM ETERNAL phone background I found
Just a little picture of a cat my friend took strolling through some quiet streets
[here]
On my laptop [I've got this] It's not something I ever put too much thought into
I just thought the colours looked alright and said that'll do
I've had it for ages now
Never felt the need to change it
In Bruges
Wall, because I get Berlin and Belgium mixed up despite them having nothing in common
Bruges and Angèle
Bruges, Jacques Brel, WW1 and Tintin
France obviously
Literally everyone including ourselves
How could you forget Germany
At least our PM doesn't get drunk and then go on the Radio
(maybe Ireland can't get TVs because they don't run on potato power)
And us and the Irish
This guy is definitely from Eastern Poland
I've heard the submarine joke, but with Ireland
It's going great ta
Lovely trip down Londonderry the other month
About 10-13°c but it feels warm because I’m on break
the “room” I just left is -22°c, I work in a freezer
Every 10 years or so they hold a referendum
Knowing that once they get that 50
01% win there's no going back
Don't worry mate, they're working on it
Yeah I was being playful
You'll have another one the second the polls are at 50
01%.
Norway are joining that Union one way or another
As are Switzerland
No that ship has sailed
I think it would be possible without Freedom of Movement but that is not acceptable to the EU so we are becoming more like Canada to the EU
The border will remain open for Croatians to holiday as Boris does of course
Well yes it certainly seems we upset a lot of people by taking over their countries so swiftly so I can see why you think that mate
Well they're not new words, but toe curling, cringe, cringey etc is what we'd use and say in the UK
How walkable is your city alone at night
And what city are you in
How likely are you to get hurt, robbed or anything
Edit: well 250 replies in and it seems like the UK is by far the most dangerous
I’m honestly surprised
London England, depends very much on the area
In general though if you keep your head down and dont show off any valuables you'll be fine
I am of course saying this as a cis man so I'm sure other perspectives might be different
I’m in Bristol, england
I’d feel safe as a woman walking around pretty much everywhere in Bristol alone at night honestly
But others would say I’m brave
London
Avoid parks and other 'remote' places at night
Dont walk through estates you dont know at night
Dont get too close to large groups of teenagers at night
I was mugged once in 28 years where I live on the outskirts of Liverpool
My friend was beaten up for talking back to a group of lads who shouted abuse at him late at night
These sort of things happen every so often but I wouldn't say the city is unsafe
It's probably less safe the younger you are because the offenders are usually groups of young boys who feel like they have something to prove
Wild dogs
Most of Bristol is alright but there is def some places like the underpasses between St Pauls and Easton at night which should be avoided
I know things have gotten better but it used to be impossible to walk up Park Street on a Friday/Saturday night without seeing blood on the streets
Just soooooo much drunken violence, like it was totally normal in the early 2000s to watch multiple fights on Park Street around 2am
I’m also in england, what city are you
hmm that's interesting perspective to me as I'm also a queer guy in South London although I guess I'm naturally "straight passing" as I'm closeted Bi
I think that's really sad you have to hide that part of yourself for but i totally understand your reasons for doing so
I wish this area was a lot more accepting of that :(
that's absolutely horrendous, baffling to me that something like that can bring out such a violent reaction from complete strangers
I hope you're safe where you are
Coming out is not even in my mind right now as I still live with my incredibly homophobic family
I've tried bringing the subject up to them in a purely academic way and the long and short of their belief system is: There's no such thing as bisexuality, you're either gay or straight and if you're gay you're going to hell
I have plans to move out soon after lockdown though
I'm completely with you, i can't wait for clubs to open again so i can explore my sexuality in peace
I have one of these
They’re such beautiful instruments to both listen to and play
There’s normally also a course in Älvkarleby during August which I’d recommend going to if you ever wanted to learn, though probably after things have calmed down COVID-wise
Where i live (London) bunch of stuff really, Royal family events (beheadings and what not), Various political things like starting wars with everyone etc etc
Where im from (Bristol) mostly where ships cast off to go and discover the new world like the Matthew or where ships left to go take part in the Atlantic slave trade a few hundred years later
Sheffield - birthplace of modern steelmaking on an industrial scale
My village is pretty insignificant but the nearest town is known by quite a few people for having a pub bombed by the IRA in the 80s cos lots of British soldiers drank there
Which city
I thought Sheffield with the Stainless Steel
Go to England, no matter what you do you’ll be a saint compared to us
leave
In England you can get bags of sweet and salty popcorn
what
why would you even-popcorn deserves better
You and me both buddy
The only one I can think about that is generally applied to Europe as a whole is the idea that Europe is overrun by evil muslims and that our liberal ways are to blame for their impending domination
Aside from the fact that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful, less than 4% of EU citizens are Muslim
It’s just an absurd conservative American talking point, which manifests as bold assertions that entire cities in Europe are ‘no-go areas’ now under sharia law
As bizarre as it is racist
The stereotype that we are all left-wing
>Worst is the people from these actual European countries playing along and confirming that it’s so fucking great here
This is why I give Americans on here the benefit of the doubt
So many Europeans here actively play up to the stereotypes, and then complain about them
Drives me crazy
TBF you could say the same thing about us when we say we wanna visit the US
There are so many varying parts that it must be irritating for Americans to hear
>Vinnie Jones punching the Swiss guards at the Vatican
I could imagine that happening tbh
I would agree
We're technically apart of it but we're not a core European state
I feel the same way about Scandinavia, in some ways, as it's effectively an island fTom mainland Europe
lwywydlwdydlyd wylldywdyalydywld, aye
A part
I made a very popular NSFW post(one of my post upvoted ever) yesterday where it featured a Czech guy, and in the title right at the start i reffered to said Czech guy as being from Central Europe not Eastern Europe etc
See so some of Western Euros are learning and have got the message
Mid sized town, England
That would get me a lovely detached house,  a decent amount of land
Four or more bedrooms
I reckon a nice sized 3 bed house with garden in a desireable area of my city, and my city is fashionable anyway (Bristol)
I live in a rural town in the south of England
You could buy a small 3 bedroom house for that around here
Similar pricing to here in Nottingham, though a townhouse of that design and quality would be more
and in london you get a studio flat with a shared kitchen
Wow I didn’t imagine Poland to be so expensive
That's crazy
In London it's the opposite, house prices have gone up more than rent has, 2k would be ridiculous (I know you can easily pay that here but you don't need to)
I guess it's a case of more foreign property investing and a higher allowed multiplier (I've heard of people getting a 5
5x mortgage, which goes a long way if you're earning £150k as a couple
Obviously most people aren't earning that, but those that are live in London mostly)
I need street name I'm afraid
Also CC number and mother maiden name please
Harry Ramsden’s; it’s a place that serves fish and chips but it’s quite expensive and you’re better off going to a local chippy for an ‘authentic’ experience
I remember being really disappointed when I visited Neuschwanstein
For years I've always wanted to go and even had it as my desktop background lol
I was pretty deflated when I finally arrived and it felt like an unfinished movie set
I know it's not an old castle at all but I guess that I wasn't expecting it to look that polished
Also the tour was really short
The plus side was the amazing cream and pumpkin soup I had after
I’ve changed my mind on Brexit
Well sqiudward, welcome to the apocalypse, I hope you like leather
Glad we're leaving the EU
A centralised European parliament is a lobbyists dream
You get to bypass the middle man that is individual national parliaments and get your corporate policy enacted over the whole continent with way less bribes
> As a Hungarian I'm used to corrupt old cucks who are not representing me by any means
We were just sold the expectation that the EP is better than that
I think in some ways a centralised European parliament is a lobbyists dream
Instead of lobbying 27 indiviudal national parliaments you can skip the middle man and go straight to the EP and get your corporate policy spread over the whole continent at once
&#x200B;
US-style lobbying, here we come
Whats wrong with dipping crusts
Let's be honest though, most of us are eating shitty frozen or fast food pizzas
Maybe what you say is true or high quality Italian pizzas but for the average one I get from the supermarket, the crust is definitely more enjoyable with a sauce than without
Fish fingers though
Can't speak for the whole country because its such a varied place, but for the Midlands:
Pros: Good transport, trains and busses connect the major cities and are of good quality
Cons: Very expensive cost of living for what it is, cold and wet, pretty miserable at times and a lack of interesting landscapes that makes me feel pretty trapped (Peak District is nice tho)
Pros: Historical and cultural sites around every corner, good standard of living, for most that is, people are very interesting
Cons: The government is incompetent, everything's expensive and Brexit is a thing
I dunno
dessert-wise you’re doing super well
Frankly, I love the weather, and I think our cuisine has been HIGHLY underrated
Could do with some better architecture though  -- side effect of being bombed repeatedly
Yep yep yep
Spot on
Speaking for Yourshire here
Pros: The tea we have is better than anywhere else, cheap transport, theres a kabab shop around every corner
Cons: Wet weather most of the time, most places stink of cigarette smoke
Technically not another country, but the Welsh national anthem is very beautiful
I also like the Italian and Portuguese national anthems, I've read the English translations
I used to like it, but the line about us never being slaves kinda ruined it after I learnt more about Britain’s involvement in the slave trade
Kind of a dickish line when considered in that context
Wales is very much another country
Says you’re a Scot on your flair
Jerusalem is my favourite
Wow Portugal, I thought we had something special
Scottish is not a Celtic anthem
Most Scottish people are not 'Celtic'. But yes, I agree
Sure
And that is to be commended
Still super fucked up
I guess he does
I get that, just confusing
There’s a  one if that helps
We were drunk, not thinking straight
I swear that’s not who we usually are
> we support turkey and love turkey
Really
Since when were Aussies massive fans of Erdogan
Saying you support and love a country you are going to be talking about its political rulers as much as the rest of the country
Saying you support and love the people would be a diffrent statement
Sorry but theres a huge difference between 'not having a problem' and 'support and love'. Like I dont have a problem with Chad because I have never been there and im not really sure what their politics are, whilst I support and love no countries really as thats an incredibly strong thing to say but I would say I have fond feeling towards countries like Canada
Are you up to date with modern Turkish politics
Like do you know what Erdogan is all about
Aberfan - A coal slag heap slid onto a school
Windscale - A nuclear fire at what is now Sellafield
Are you talking about the Great Fire of London 1666
Yeah, that's a big one, but, I thought the OP was asking about sort of recent ones
England and Wales are both part of the UK, that's why I included both
Okie doke, no harm, no foul
York ham is almost unknown here (I live in York) - from what I gather it's a long and Labour-intensive curing process that's difficult to mass-produce, so it sort of died
Whereas I believe in Spain, *Jamón de York* is a generic phrase meaning any cooked ham
I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong
Otherwise, most stereotypical English food is eaten, if rarely
I don't think I've ever encountered cucumber sandwiches cut into little circles in the wild, for instance
Yeah afternoon tea is the sort of thing you might take your grandma or mother to for mothers day or their birthday if they're in to that sort of thing
Or maybe you're on a day trip to somewhere and you want to do something to break the afternoon up, have a sit down with some tea a cake is great if you've been walking around shops/museums all day
More than once I've come across Americans thinking that a "Cream Tea" meand putting cream in your cuppa
I've been to a fair few restaurants across France and i swear onion soup is *always* an option
Aye but had my first full Scottish breakfast couple years when I was up at a mates
The haggis and tattie scones alone makes it top the English breakfast imo
Divine stuff
Even the word “regional” is generous
Are associated with the East End of London; literally one area of one city
Literally never even heard of eating eels till I saw that Vice video about the eel and pie shop in east london
They’re not specifically a british thing really
that'd be fettuccine al toro
We have the knock on wood
If theres no wood
around you can use your head
> if you hick up that meas someone is speaking about you that moment
For some reason that reminds me of one we have where if you get a sudden shiver or shudder for no reason (not like cos you're cold) that's meant to mean someone walked over your (future) grave
Creepy haha
If the wind changes your face will stay that way

Classissm is incredibly rife and impacts all parts of society
Very rarely do friendships even cross class boundaries
Terrible poverty issues over here, 1 in 4 children live in poverty (1 in 3 even in Milton Keynes)
That’s truly horrific
So sorry you have to deal with shit like that
When I was in Dublin we took a taxi and the driver was, in addition to being a racist, complaining about the cyclists and the police helping them
He even pointed out a policeman on the street who he actually recognised and angrily called a “fat pig”; the guy had apparently assisted a cyclist whom the driver had run into, and made it clear that the driver was in the wrong and liable for damages
It was wiiiiiild
Social class isn’t entirely about wealth here, more just whatever class you were raised around
You can be upper class and poor
Same as Wayne Rooney will always be working class despite being wealthy
I think the 'zoning laws' and 'building restrictions' is deliberately overplayed
Land banking is the true scandal
And its the neoliberals who drive this
>[A little digging into the latest financial reports of  the top 10 housebuilders reveals a very different story
Between them,  they have a staggering 632,785 building plots on their books, of which  more than half have planning permission
At the same time, these 10  companies reported building a total of just 79,704 homes – which means  they have, on average, eight-years’ worth of plots in their land banks at the current rate of construction
&#x200B;
>[The analysis of housing ministry (MCHLG) figures showed that in 2016-17,  planning permission for 313,700 new homes was given, but only 183,570  homes built, meaning a notional annual gap of more than 130,000 homes,  the biggest divergence since records began in 2006
The difference is always accent, tastes, mannerisms, attitudes etc
The things you learn from your family, school, peers etc
If an upper class person lost their wealth they’d still retain the above, you don’t lose your background
If they were still poor by the time they had kids their kids probably wouldn’t be considered upper class though because they’d be surrounded by upper class family but middle or working class peers at school and wherever they live
Caste systems are all about inheritance aren’t they
Whereas here, again using Wayne Rooney as an example, his kids would be middle class despite having working class parents because they’ll presumably go to private school and be surrounded by middle class people
I think caste systems are more rigid although I’m not that familiar with them, isn’t it quite specific to India also
This'll be fun for the UK
Erm, my money will have to be on Wales
That's mostly because I can't think of anyone who dislikes Wales, jokey or otherwise
Online or not
Theres only one joke everyone is UK can think to go to about them but noone seems to actually get riled up or actually annoyed at Wales
Probably due to a low population and the way they're integrated into UK
Mostly every region takes the piss out of eachother here anyway (mostly based on v historical events)  Manchester and Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow, yorkshire and Lancashire, Scottish lowlands and highlands, North and South of England and everyone and London
I'm sure there are plenty of other regions with rivalries I'm forgetting
Just seems to be what we do
Probably Cornwall is nearest to your description
But in the UK every place is hated
Good point of another division in the UK
Admittedly, I was referring to all Wales together
The same tired joke I mentioned I think are generally referred to all Welsh outside Wales no matter where they are from
Honestly I dont know much about the relationship between N Wales and S Wales
If you're asking me personally, I grew up in Manchester so most of my personal experience of Wales was North Wales (Anglesey, etc)
What about people from Devon
Devon is south west lol
I can't understand those highlanders in Edinburgh, or in its big suburb of Glasgow
You could just buy regular cream and leave it in the back garden
When i visited Moscoe in January is was minus 27
I had never experienced it
I got on a bus and the inside of the bus was frozen with ice everywhere
It hurt to breathe
Haha
I loved it though
Are you in Winnipeg
It was an old coach type bus and it was as cold inside as outside
This was no where near the centre i was staying in a residential area that was named after a Physicist or an astronaught i cant remember the name of the area
I heard it hits like 40° in the summer too
It sounds like the middle of canada has the worst possible climate
I remembered
I was in Korolyov
It was Korolyov
Yeah it’s considered cheap-tier in England
It’s extremely popular though because of how cheap it is
I live in East Yorkshire; everyone worships Lidl and Aldi here
Yeah they can, don’t really know how common it is but it can and does happen here
For example, I’m a man and my best friend since I was about 10 years old is a woman
unambiguously yes
Definitely, most of my best friends are girls, I don’t see the point in saying that boys and girls shouldn’t be friends, if I get along with them, feel comfortable and have a laugh that’s all I’m looking for, their gender isn’t an issue
It depends
If I don’t know the person I sometimes say “Hello Espionage speaking”. If it’s a professional call then I’d say the above plus ...”from Espionage work place”. Often however I’ll just say “Hello”.
I do that if it’s an unknown caller
I started doing it when I started getting spam calls
England was fully unified in 927 under [Æthelstan] rule, making the country ~1093 years old (though much progress towards unification had already been made by Alfred the Great in the latter part of the 800s)
Of course England no longer exists as an independent country
The UK came into being only in 1801 (hence 219 years old) through the merger of the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain, but this could kind of be viewed as essentially a continuation of the Kingdom of Great Britian, just with Ireland incorporated in
Now the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed in 1707 when the England and Scotland united into one (England and Scotland had shared the same monarch for many years prior)
So if this view was taken the UK would be 312 years old instead
1066 I believe with the Norman conquest
William is seen as the first english king so idk
England was still multiple kingdoms until then so it was kind of the official unification of England
I never said I was a historian
Just going off of what little we learn in school about our history
Even that horrible histories song only starts at William
Cheers for the information though
Google is a very good tool
I’d would pay for delivery
Though my dad has a van so would actually use that
If not then rental vans aren’t too expensive
Renting a small van is usually super cheap compared with car rentals
That being said most decent sofa companies will include delivery
> Load bearing wall
> Carpenter
That combination strikes fear into my heart
I mean, I *know* wooden buildings are structurally sound, but still, I feel better with stone/breeze block (cinder block)/brick holding up the roof
Though our internal walls that aren't load bearing are typically drywall (known as plasterboard here) which means, yeah, they're easy to put up/take down
Skirting boards or under floor boards
Yeah lots of Brits feel like Australians are similar to us but their country feels more like the US in terms of city planning etc
Yeah quite middle class and had a nanny, but i find mentioning that though is usually grounds for having the piss taken out of you
Kind of, we did Food and Nutrition as a subject until year 10 and then you could keep doing it if you wanted to do it for GCSEs
Yes, we have food tech, most schools do it, it's mandatory until year 9 when you can either continue it or drop it
Some schools offered textiles and most schools offer design technology which is "woodworking" for y'all Americans
Most people here did but it was generally something that happened once per year, although some people will have had it more often
It was seen more as a treat than as an actual subject in my school
Yes we had Food Technology in my school during Year 7 to 9 (age 11 to 14)
It was rotated throughout the year along with textiles, resistant materials and woodwork so everyone got to do all 4
We’d get given a list of ingredients to buy at the end of the lesson
We’d bring them in to school and drop them off in the classroom in the morning, ready for our 2 hour lesson after lunch
All I can really remember making is garlic bread
This was a grammar school in England in the mid 2000’s.
Yeah, we have ‘Design and technology’. Well i finished school > 10yrs ago so it may have changed
For the first 3 years of secondary school (ages 11-13 roughly), we did a rotation of lessons in Food (cooking all sorts, cakes, pasta, made mayonnaise once too but can’t remember what else), wood work, metal work, IT - think it was called SCAT (programming traffic lights and lazer printing etc) and then textiles (sewing/fabric work)
In 4th year you got to choose which one you wanted to do your GCSE in, i did food
Yeah i did a gcse in food techology
Also from down south
Plenty of Brits retire to the continent and fail to learn the language(s) so we really haven’t got a leg to stand on
I think it’s important when getting citizenship, obviously in situations where they are immigrants fleeing war or something along those lines that can be addressed at a later date
All in all though to be a citizen of a country you should know the language to an upper intermediate level or higher, not including those who have a dual citizenship or something similar, but if they’re living there then I’d say it’s crucial
Do you speak many other languages
I imagine it's very similar in every country
You don't need a single qualification to be a Guardsman
Are US Marines notorious for for their spelling proficiency
>slang dialects are taking over
What are you talking about
We have less accents now in England now than ever
How do you think people sounded 100 years ago when most hadn't left their town
We don't like our neighbours
I haven’t seen my neighbours since I was about 5
Over 10 years now
Three days a week I work from home
I do have a 5 min drive to take the kids to school though, and another one to pick them up
One day a week, it's a 10 min drive to a train station then a 40 minute train ride followed by a 10 min walk
Once every other week it's a 90 min drive to another city
I could take the train, but it's slower than driving and my car never gets canceled
On a good day, a 9 minute drive
Anything longer than 30 mins commute is unacceptable to me
It’s a waste of so much of my life
There was a Greek guy at my uni named Hercules Which I always thought was awesome
Theseus is another great Greek one
Joachim & Emil are pretty cool names
Hector
I also like Hans
Vladimir is a good name but I worry in this country people would think it was a bit ... vampire-ish
I love the Russian versions of men's names
If I had kids I'd be very tempted to give them all Russian names
I don't really like Oscar, it sounds a bit obnoxiously middle class to me
My youngest brother is named Victor, after his maternal Great Grandfather (Stepmum is half Ukrainian, half Dagestani)
Went years thinking it was spelt with a K, but it turns out my parents had decided to anglicise it
Probably about 50
If inheriting a home counts as moving out
In the UK we "move out" when we go to university but not usually fully
You'll normally still come back home during university breaks and most people live at home after they leave university for a bit
Is this not common in Russia
I  don't see how Subutai isn't the greatest general ever
He spent his entire life spanking whoever he was pointed at
Russians, Chinese, Turks, Iranians, Poles, Hungarians, etc
East Midlands English is only a minority dialect in the same way that speaking with a Yorkshire or Bristolian accent is, but it’s an accent than is so often ignored or overlooked that when it does appear in mainstream media, it’s always a shock
There’s [clips] of Conan O’Brien and Angelina Jolie saying ‘ay up me duck” and it’s the most jarring thing imaginable
My god, what the hell was that
As a person who has spent half my life living on Tyneside and therefore am very familiar with the accent and dialect, that was the worst imitation of a Geordie accent I’ve ever heard from a person by a country mile
And it was deemed good enough to broadcast on tv
He sounds more Irish than he does Geordie, with a few random Geordie dialect words thrown in there, probably to try and make it sound more convincing
People with awful teeth
Bad teeth
Eating crumpets
So annoying
Depends where in the UK you live
In the north "cunt" is incredibly common and how insulting it is depends on the context
All of it
They can't hide the leprechauns forever
And in a couple of days I will initiate the annual ritual of failing to get tickets in the lottery
I was speaking to Sweden yesterday and they said you’re a bunch of douchebags
Always victims
Dude shut the fuck up
It's the victim mentality I'm eluding to
You've been independent for nearly 100 years and you still constantly bang on about the English
That sticking two fingers up at someone was a universal offensive gesture like the middle finger
I thought dairy milk was a big thing, I mean yes they do have it in other countries but I was thinking it would be like a huge thing
That there are seven continents
In the UK we see North America and South America as individual continents, but I gather that many countries see them as a single continent
In the UK: Europe, Africa, Antartica, Asia, Oceania, North America, South America
(Everywhere else
): Europe, Africa, Antartica, Asia, Oceania, America
When I went to Germany my host family literally only drank that aha
Looks very similar to our chippies
Beans on toast is genuinely one of my favourite meals in the world
Nothing is as comforting
I like the beans with the little sausages
I like to cook the beans down so the sauce becomes really thick and the beans become mushy
I butter the shit out of the bread so that the butter mixes in with the sauce and becomes really rich
I also like to heavily pepper the beans so they get a little kick
Perfection
I mean across the pond, we have an entire theme park equipped with a factory tour and a 4D cinema dedicated to Cadbury Dairy Milk so I guess that kicks Hershey’s butt
Sort of thing id expect from the Americans
Looks quite similar from Google images
A little takeaway food shop with a load of fried stuff on display
You poor soul, I hereby grant you dual British and Irish citizenship, though you must know that Hershey is rapidly growing and is readily available pretty much everywhere
Hey, Cadbury world is the shit, who doesn’t like learning about a Quaker Victorian bloke who made an entire village for his factory workers
Sure, like the Americans
Not patriotic but a celebration of joy, shared culture and history of your country
Right
Sticky
Toffee
Pudding
When it’s good, it’s toe-curlingly good
Like, When Harry Met Sally cumming at the table good
I’ve had three course meals at fancy-schmancy restaurants in which STP was the best thing by a country mile
Honourable mentions go to Victoria Sponge cake and Strawberry Trifles
[Rhubarb Crumble] and or [Apple Pie] both served with custard
When it comes to the culinary arts, we Brits imo really do have the best desserts in the world, we are world leaders in the field of sweet treats
My mother is a particular fan of syrup and cheese, you seem like you might appreciate this - I personally find it weird but she says it's tasty and completely normal
That we have been a democracy for a long time, we didn't have universal suffrage till 1918, only just over a hundred years
That we held out "alone" after the Fall of France until Barbarossa and Pearl Harbor
Alone except for the Empire, of course - Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, the West Indies, etc etc
And all those Free French, Polish, Czechoslovak, Dutch, Danish, Belgian Norwegian etc guys
And increasingly the US - even before they entered the war they were running convoy escorts, letting us buy arms on very good terms and sharing intel
Hasn't France won more wars than any other nation in world history
Yeah, but between China, India and America I reckon that's about half the world's population right there
Its not beer, but in the UK we have mulled wine and or mulled cider as a special christmas booze drink
Christmas time is the only time you'll see such mulled drinks
It's not a mainstream thing, but a lot of smaller craft breweries do a seasonal ale, usually a darker, maltier beer and sometimes spiced
Traditionally they have corny and/or rude pun names and a cartoony label
Log burners are quite common where i live, South West England countryside
We generally have a log burner in the living room but would also have central heating to heat the rest of the house
My parents have one but it's not the primary way they heat their house
You never learnt about the transatlantic slave trade or the Raj
Hong Kong, Singapore
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Sendai, Sapporo, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Fukushima
that’s it off the top of my head
Horishima, Nagasaki, Tokyo
five, three because of nuclear disaster
tokyo, kyoto, hiroshima, nagasaki and fukushima
**sorry
Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Toyota,
Off the top of my head without googling(in no particular order, i apologise in advance for the bad spelling, i know quite a few from watching the rugby world cup, and ive been following the J-League for years plus lastly im really into sumo(im a big fat chubby guy myself, so over the years ive become a big fan of the sport and these amazing athletes) and im really into Japanese gay porn(especially big muscular, buff and chubby thicc/muscle-chub Japanese guys, that's my fav type of Japanese porn), so ive come to hear of alot of Japan's cities that way etc i digress)
but the Japanese cities i can name are
Tokyo/Endo, Osaka, Kashiwa, Fukishima, Kumamoto, Nigata, Iga, Sapporow, Fujiisowa, Kobe, Toyota, Yokohama, Kyoto, Kofu, Ibaraki, Fukuokka, Shizuokka, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Nagoya, Gunma, Nagoka, Saitama, Kamaishi, Tosu, Koriyama, Kawasaki, Suzuka, Aki, Sendai, Ueda, Nagano, Sakai etc etc
And that's about it
Kumagaya
Ugh can’t believe I forgot Kobe
I think most of the current cabinet, or least some of the senior figures
Opposition politician leader is now more popular than our Prime Minister in recent polls so things are going to be interesting for sure
Boris Johnson, I don’t even have to say why, I’m sure you lot already know what he’s done in the past few months
Probably Michael Gove
He was the minister of education for several years and is responsible for a lot of current problems in our schools
Also a very punchable face
Nah twitter is fuelled with criticisms of his and his government currently
Everyone I know can’t stand him other than the odd conservative friend of mine
We did a fair bit in WW1 and WW2
Ramsay MacDonald
Christ you know you're an alcoholic when you promise a kingdom to a shite brand of cider
Dear Nazi Germany,
Gutted to hear about Hitler :(
Sending hugs and prayers xxxx
You shouldn't be drinking that bollocks anyway, you're not a 15 year old girl in a field
Anything to do with politics
Well
what to pick
Brexit…
That bacon sandwich is responsible for Brexit
Anytime I use public transport outside London
The huge differences between where I am and say London
Seeing the size of the people who live in Northern England
Not saying obesity isnt a thing in the south but being from a wealthy area of a wealthy city you never really see any
Whilst city centers in the north, oh my
Yeah
I don't think many people realise Welsh is the proper daily spoken language in most of North Wales until they visit
I certainly didn't.
Whereabouts are you
Pretty much
Blew my mind seeing school kids riding the tube on their own
Not far off London actually either, the Midlands
When we converge on every Mediterranean party/holiday resort and drunk disgusting amounts of alcohol and proceed to shout, swear, fight, puke, and shag
I've never finished a cup of tea
Can't stand the stuff
How do you feel about sheep
Dutch courage = getting drunk
Irish/French goodbye = leaving without saying anything
It's all Greek to me = I don't understand it
One that's stigmatised in my country but not most of Europe: Not wearing a uniform in school
Basically every school requires a uniform which always involves a shirt, trousers and black shoes
For primary school there's usually a solid coloured jumper, with red, green, blue and to a lesser extent purple and burgundy being common colours
In secondary schools the uniform is taken more seriously and generally involves, more or less, a full suit
Dress shirt, tie, blazer, black dress pants, black leather shoes (not trainers)
Small violations, such as wearing the tie too low/high or wearing the wrong kind of pants are taken unreasonably seriously
The dress code also extends to hair, with almost any dyed hair cut or even a crew cut being considered too extreme for school
Apparently most of Europe doesn't even have school uniforms, over here if your hair is a few cm too short in a state school or they consider your style unprofessional, expect to go back home until it grows out
In some countries you're not allowed to cross a clear road unless the light is green or you're at a crossing
Here you just cross when you deem it safe and it's perfectly legal
Anti-gypsy comments are still a common thing in Spain, too
Not on TV or publicly, but on the street a lot of people have negative opinions of them
It's not that it's not accepted in the UK, it's just not particularly popular
It's never really been part of our cuisine
Horses are/were primarily beasts of burden, entertainment or transportation
Now, Cows, pigs, sheep, goats, even pigeons, that's a different story
Still very common in the UK in areas with high gypsy populations too
Nah you can ask questions in lectures here
Plenty of people do it
It depends on the lecturer and maybe the university but mostly its on the actual lecturer themselves and if you can't its because of time schedules and making sure the lectures don't run over
It's an uncommon item in what appears to be a very low magic campaign
Totally worth it
Nah its not forbidden food people still often eat rabbit stew
Well, I always get the feeling its more of a countryside thing than a city thing where rabbits are still hunted etc and we aren't so squeamish about the death of them
I have to admit I do find it a little upsetting but it didn't stop me from eating it
I would rather have a shorter lunch and finish work quicker to be honest
Why are asians bringing in salt lol
Good point
Things like chasing cheese down hills are pretty strange
Maypole dancing is ridiculous
Morris dancing
Not the dancing specifically, but the outfits and hats and bells on the knees
Photos of this are super popular on gay porn blogs, as you can imagine
It’s... it’s like god’s gift to the gays
Now that's the real Turkish Delight right there
But this needs to become a global sport asap
I hope the Olympics are watching cuz they just found a new sport to add imo
I'd be down for some Turkish oil wrestling, sign me up
Its awesome no lie
Its right up my alley
Might I ask what sketch
Its the true, real Turkish Delight
Jack the Ripper
Famous *because* he was a bad person
Otherwise probably would have just been a normal doctor
Depends on who you ask
Only the top 10 in that list was actually voted on by the public, do he came last in that terms
The list also has Guy Fawkes listed as a great Briton yet his failure, capture and death is celebrated every year
Chased those Normans down that bastard hill
Perfidious
France
And I juuuust realised where Nova Scotia gets its name from
Cool
Debatable
Have you ever been to East Anglia
They're kind of similar cities
I thought the British had ended impressment before the war had even started (of course with communication being what it was there was no way America could've known)
I love FE-Schrift
To be fair, I love everything German… (except some of their history between 1911-1914 and 1939-1945
I’ve always said, it’s the only other country I could happily live in
The Belgian plates are definitely not anywhere near the best
The old UK ones look good though
I love how Southern European countries always have loads of cute little reptiles scampering about
Shutters on windows
Going out for a drink and having one drink (almost everywhere means I exclude the Republic of Ireland from this)
If you get out and about you can still find plenty of reptiles in the summer in England
I fucking love British food
I saw a lizard in my garden once
It was the weirdest shit because you never see them here also don’t talk shit about the wood pigeons
Yeah, I know we have a few, but like you said, we don't just casually see them out and about
>Seriously tho, why
Doesn't it bother you that people can see inside of your house
Or you in private
Most people who were rich or middle class historically had a big hedge or wall for that outside their front garden
I think the reason is that people don't want to have to go outside and close them when it's raining
My mother has this inner curtain thing, so she has two curtains in her front room, a thick outer one and a thin inner one, it's called a double curtain, a lot of people use it in place of shutters so people can't see in
Looks like this  [
Agreed, I think countries with shutters only tend to have net curtains, whereas most curtains in the UK are thick and opaque
I've never witnessed anything similar, that doesn't sound like typical behaviour to me
We do have thick curtains or blinds to block windows when we change/ at night, but you don't keep your shutters closed during the day, do you
If people have a window that is overlooked by other houses or the street, they tend to have net curtains for privacy during the day
I don't think the difference between thick blinds/curtains or shutters makes a difference to privacy, but I have no explanation for why this man was naked without his curtains closed, unless he didn't realise people could in
I see that way more than the slashed Z
I second this (although I think it's normally more like ʒ than a 3 - it's still a zig-zag at the start, just with a tail)
A family member has a Z in their name and whenever we get Christmas/birthday/etc
cards there are always a few ʒ's but I don't think I've ever seen one with a ƶ.
It’s very old fashioned but I had teachers at school that wrote it that way
If you google Victorian handwriting it seems the standard
I’d never associated it with the Cyrillic alphabet personally
That’s only my personal experience though, other British people in this thread seem to use the Z with a slash which I’ve never seen
I guess it varies depending on schools, industries you work in, etc
I think everyone except Sting has one
I'm the only one of five siblings who doesn't have a middle name
I thought OP was talking about surnames
Lots of people here don’t have middle names
Which family name do children take from their parents
Mixing sweet and savoury (eg bacon and maple syrup, chicken and waffles)
Just
I've noticed Canadian travellers in the UK tend to be festooned with maple leaves, presumably so they don't get mistaken for Yanks
We do it in the UK and I *hate* it
"How do you do
" is a traditional greeting, which you return with another "How do you do
I'm not making this up; it's madness
Liverpool played Sevilla in Boston yesterday and also against Dortmund in South Bend a few days ago whilst on their preseason tour of America
Before both matches they played the national anthem, haha
Really bizarre
Just to not go for something obvious in London I will mention the [Bloomberg Arcade] Its very much in the heart of the London financial district and rather that trying to be something completely different it leans into its corporate steel and brickwork and is just a cool place to walk around with [an interesting water feature] and of course [amazing views of much older architecture]
One of my favourites is the [Royal College of Physicians] next to the Regents Park in London
A classic example of Brutalism in the UK, and one that isn't as divisive as others such as the [National Theatre] (also a favourite of mine)
Indeed it is
I spent a lot of time at the Barbican whilst at uni in London
Such a cool place to explore
It's a marvel in my opinion
If it were to happen it would vindicate Brexit
No thanks, but we are leaving anyway so I don't really care
This is one of the reasons we voted Leave though, people in the UK are very uncomfortable with any further union
I suppose so
Euro-federalists get their dream
Brexiteers are proved right and the political divide in our country is healed, allowing us to move on
Thing is though, even within remainers actual federalists are a minority
Remainers basically wanted to keep the status quo
Almost none of them would ever want to join the euro, join an EU military or become a member of a 'united states of Europe'. In fact, they were things they said would never happen
So if the EU were to actually go in that direction then they wouldn't really have an argument anymore
The EU they wanted to remain in wouldn't exist anymore
But in this hypothetical the EU the Brexiteers want to leave will exist
That's all I'm saying
No, I don’t think I really learnt anything about Finland at School
Didn't even know about Finland till I started doing my own personal historical research about the world
What kind of school did you go to
The history curriculum is focused on world history, local history, and national history
Eh, no we don't.  The history curriculum framework is is focused on ***world history***, national history, and local history
Used to be similar here
But our curriculum changed in 2013 and now in geography it's all about countries, cities, etc
It wasn't like that for a while though, when I was at school in the early 2000s it wasn't.
For some reason the old geography curriculum went alone the lines of climate/ weather/ water cycles/ rivers/ mountains/ earthquakes/ volcanoes etc
That sort of stuff only
That's not the current history curriculum framework though
And most countries tend to teach history that is more relevant to them
I did The Romans (national but also world history), Ancient Egyptians, Tudors, Stuarts, WW1/WW2, Anglo Saxons, Normans, Industrial Revolution, Victorians, etc
Certainly did do world history topics
Now at school people learn about Chinese/African history topics and more ancient world civilizations like Ancient China, Indus Valley, Maya civilization, The Aztecs, etc
Just to name a few
Big Ben,
London Eye,
Blackpool Tower,
The Gherkin (Mary Axe),
St pancras hotel and train station,
The Shard,
Tower Bridge,
Houses of Parliament,
Seconded on Lincoln Cathedral
Wonderful structure
And your right, it was the tallest building in the world, between 1311 and 1548
I recall being a bit underwhelmed by it if I’m being brutally honest
Still, the first twisted skyscraper
Historical importance
I mean when you consider that they dragged them all the way across from Wales and over the Bristol Channel it genuinely is
Not many know about fountains abbey to be honest its quite hidden in the Yorkshire Dales, i dont live too far from it
But if you really explore England you will find so many ruined abbeys
>  I know y'all have history coming out every orifice there, but it's weird to be in a place that was in operation longer than the US has been a country
We used to have a lot more
There's the ruins of the stables of a grand manor quite near to me, boarded up and left to rot
Around 2,000 significant country houses have been lost in England alone, mostly in the 1900s.
It _was_ the world’s tallest building
Big ben is the name that's used, everyone just calls it Big ben
My family never really goes on big abroad holidays we just explore the UK, but theres loads of 18th, 19th century mansions
(I only like them because theres almost always an old piano i can play) but you can just walk around the grounds of the mansions and just explore
Most of them are owned by national trust
My school was older than the US
Speaking as a recruitment consultant and former estate agent, I’d say recruitment consultants and estate agents
Bouncers (Nightclub /Bar security) in major cities like London, Bristol etc, tend to be very sexist and kinda racist towards certain ethnic groups getting into clubs etc
Bouncers in smaller cities and towns are normally fine, in Portsmouth at least they are, even been joined for a drink by them a couple of times, but to be fair I only go drinking with my mates, and we are all white blokes from Portsmouth , so are the customers they are most likely to get along with, because bouncers in this kind of city are just local fat blokes in black tshirts
I would imagine maybe foreigners or people from an ethnic minority would have a worse experience with the Portsmouth bouncers than I do though
They generally are a lot less formal than in London or a major city
Can I ask if you’re happy in your current role
(Joke - please don’t hit me
Same in the UK, they have inspectors here too, but they have no legal right to actually enter your home, so you can just ignore them if you want
Most people do pay it, but a lot of young people don't pay it because they only watch TV on their computer etc, so there's no way to prove anything
Its like £140, I'm not paying that, its insane
I mean tbf the BBC doesn't have any adverts, but it does definitely have some issues of political bias (it favours centrists from any political party heavily)
I’m embarrassed for my fellow recruiters
You can definitely be biased towards the centre and the establishment
The BBC is very hostile to both people on the left like Corbyn and to the more right wing Conservatives like Jacob Rees-Mogg, they provide big coverage to many has-been centrist politicians to bash them in both parties such as Ken Clarke and various former Blair cabinet ministers
I think there's difference between being actively neutral, and actively supporting the establishment centrists in both parties
IIRC there was a local boy who went missing at a similar time and didn't get anywhere near the same publicity
Like others have said the fact it was a middle class family, and also the fact it was a girl
Generally girls get the most attention, then boys, then women, then men
I think the parents were fairly well connected, so they were able to keep up support for the search
In fairness black pete is kinda messed up
I remember that, it really did piss me off
Nothing much you can do about this sort of thing either because at the end of the day people will care about what they care about, there isn't much we can do to make a population care about something they don't want to
Newspapers largely just push the stories they know will sell
Personally I think it’s messed up whatever way you look at it
Cleared my diary, and switched off my phone, to watch Trooping the Colour on BBC
I made someone a cup of tea after they had been through a serious crisis
Did maypole dancing, of course
>Ordering pasta at a Chinese restaurant in Germany (regretted it)
Why didn't you just have Chinese food
underappreciated comment
If there's one thing I've noticed, it's that Spaniards love Newquay
Honorary Brit
Oh I understand
I pictured you walking into a restaurant that specialises in Chinese food and ordering a ragu bolognese haha
I think you might be referring to cockney
They speak with glottal stops so water becomes wa'er
icelandic, and by extension, really any nordic language (except danish), in fact fuck it, **all** germanic languages are really easy on the ear
spanish is a world of fun to pronounce, though
Icelandic, Estonian, Italian, Mandarin, Kazakh, Yakut,
I love Irish and Scottish Gaelic
could listen to them all day
Shame the orthography of each are so odd-looking
It used to be French but as I've gotten older I've come to appreciate German, I'm not sure what accent it is but that softer and slightly higher tempo German sounds great
Just because it is in many ways considered the ‘default’ so it gets ignored : (
Well, it sounds completely different depending on where the speaker is from
you probably have the best looking and sounding language in europe if not the world
Nah there are some lovely American accents
What people perhaps don’t enjoy is the volume
~~spit the potatoes out and speak norwegian~~
i totally agree
i'm awful at pronouncing foreign languages but i've been told my spanish pronunciation is really good
that's not to brag though — it is *really* easy
but so many people in my spanish class struggle over even rudimentary vocabulary
i think the most difficult sounds are /r/ as in perro and /ɾ/ as in pero
i think about 50% of people are incapable of alveolar taps or flaps, statistically
what i meant was north germanic
i know that, i wasn't including finnish in what i originally said
i was specifically referring to north germanic languages bar danish
Oh boy, we certainly get a lot of hate and insults
I don't like people who hate on other countries
We're all the same really
I don’t like the stereotype of Americans being ignorant/stupid/insular
It’s easy as someone from a smallish, cosmopolitan European country to take the piss out of rednecks, but there are completely legitimate geographic and economic reasons for big swathes of the US being isolated and unsophisticated
It feels very much like punching down
Just because the US as a country is powerful, that doesn’t mean it’s suddenly ok to be snobby towards their poor people
With ridicule happy for anything original aimed at anyone
Most insults however usually reflect badly on the originator, since they are rooted in ignorance, prejudice and are based on petty tribal views we should have left behind 200 years ago, when even then they were probably inaccurate
Because nobody else has said it yet, Wales: "haha, they fuck sheep, heh, they speak nonsense". People like that can fuck off
~~I *might* just be a Welsh-aboo or something though, idk
The "France is full of cowards" thing is both annoying and simply wrong
You try defending your country when 2/3 of your army has been encircled and destroyed
Also getting real tired of the spooky no-go zone myths about Sweden
yeah leave us alone, especially brexit jokes are becoming totally excessive because they are usually unrelentingly pro-EU and have absolutely zero thought put into them other than 'leave EU = nothing good happen again', also jokes about our colonial history, as well as the concept of having a politically irrelevant monarch being somehow an invariable threat to our personal freedoms
also stop insulting/downplaying europe as a whole and stop referring to it like a country
Never heard any of those
I would agree with this
Over the last 10-15 years I’ve meet and got to know loads of Polish people who’ve moved over to the UK
In the main they are some of the nicest, hardest working and fun people I’ve met
I love the Poles and also feel very defensive when people talk them down
If anything, jokes about Vietnam tend to paint them in a positive light at the USA's expense, surely
I've never heard that they're drunks
I'm surprised anyone cares
We seem to be easy targets
All you have to do is call us idiots or evil or racist and everyone agrees and laughs
I'll try
The Black Sea coast is owned by the Russians
Any car with 3 digits in a row e.g 333, 888 etc
is a mafia car
Actually that's all I know (negatively) about Bulgaria, except for you siding with the Nazis in WW2 (which is unfortunately true but hey-ho, that's history for you)
Edit: Oh, and your government ia one of the most (obviously) corrupt in Europe
But that's unfortunately true and not something to joke about
It's a real problem that fucks over most Bulgarians
Damned Italians, they ruined Italy
Everyone knows that the Etruscans are the true Italians
We do that here too lol, typically middle age woman use it but more defo could
If someone’s having a gossip they’d go ‘your julies been up to something, my Sharon heard about it from Jim’s Beth’
I’ve got to say it’s getting a lot better recently; they actually give you tips for each lesson now and if you get a common error it points out where you went wrong and the rules around it, whereas before it was extremely difficult to find out the rules and grammar of a language without actually learning it in school
I know the monarchy is quite popular here, but I'm inclined to agree
I don't think we should get rid of the Queen, but I think that ***if*** she dies, it would be a could time to abolish the monarchy
I think that its abolition is inevitable, and it's best to have it end on a good note, rather than a bad one
People buy six packs and off brand Jack Daniels in Iran like people buy weed over here lol
Not sure if this counts but I live near the Castle where the Nine Days Queen was executed
There’s also a myth about the castle where during the English civil war, a pregnant woman and her army general husband were hiding
The opposing side eventually lay siege and her husband died and she had a miscarriage
Her only will was to be buried with her husband and child but obviously that couldn’t be arranged due to war
Now her ghost apparently wonders the church close to my home, forever looking for her child
Third and finally, apparently a father murdered his daughter in a dilapidated house on castle grounds
There have been sightings of ghosts where an actress for a castle tour went on lunch break but her colleagues claimed she stuck around
The
Purple Aki
He is a 6 ft 5 in tall bodybuilder who stalks young lads and demands to feel/measure their muscles
He was banned from touching people's muscles by a Liverpool Court
The famous cottingley fairies were photographed just up the road
Never been, but my mums from there
Didn't have much to say about it
I found that strange too
Seems like a good idea to me
Sounds quite environmentally friendly to focus on cooling yourself directly rather than the whole room with AC
Also think they can look nice
I don’t think this is just a German thing, 100% do this in UK too
Though some appliances could be left, it depends if there are furnishings agreed in the sale too
Also if the appliance was built-in then that would likely stay
Thank god, I thought it was just me and my friends being weird
I'm surprised it isn't the norm everywhere, I'm surprised at how a host is expected to provide alcohol for every guest at a party seems like a lot of money to fork out
Sounds like the bumps
You hold the birthday person up by the arms and legs and lift them up and down, once for every year
It's not something that happens anymore, but people my parents age used to do it
I find the one that we’re all ugly pretty funny
It’s pretty ridiculous to paint a whole country as ugly
But then sometimes I come back from a holiday on the continent, look around at us and think, fuck me, we are a sorry looking bunch
A greek person once told me that their stereotype of British people is that all the women are ugly and all the men are gay
Have to say that's definitely my favourite
That we need licenses to buy butter knifes and people get arrested and chucked in jail for not having one
I hate the stereotype that our food is bad
I don’t care if people disagree with me; if you can’t enjoy a beautifully prepared roast dinner, or a full English breakfast, or proper chip shop chips, or a nice buttery crumpet, or a lovely strawberry trifle, or even just beans on toast (with a little cheddar on top), I feel sorry for you
One that I find amusing
that all English men are gay
Old-fashioned at this point but still there
It’s funny because I actually am gay, and if all English men were gay as well, I’d be in heaven
I’d never leave this island again
Finally you confessed
I've heard speaking Spanish as a tourist in Portugal is a big no no
Is it common for tourists to think you guys speak Spanish or as you say actually part of Spain
I've only ever seen the teeth thing from Americans, it's pretty much their go to when insulting us
Similar to how we apparently all stab each other and have an acid attack problem because we don't have guns
>Leprechauns don't exist
Wait what
How
What has it got to be the US
its the UK that has the stereotype not the US
Oh I totally agree
To be so unaware of the rest of the world and not even bother to check the language when travelling somewhere is disrespectful
No, you started it when you shagged all those sheep
10-12 degrees without wind is perfectly fine for tshirt and shorts if you stay at least mildly active
16-17 degrees if you are stationary or if it is windy
Yorkshire lass here
If I won't be frostbitten within 10 seconds of leaving the house, the jacket stays in the cupboard
Since moving to London, I've been shocked at how soft the southerners are, and even more shocked at how incredibly, crazily delicate people from the continent are
I've become very close friends with an Italian lady and she NEVER leaves her flat without a jacket
Bonkers
Begins with B.
Ends in it
Rhymes slightly with bad shit
pass
I was in Lille a couple of years ago and it was scorching - 30+ degrees anyway which is scorching to me - and those poor soldiers patrolling in full kit
I'd have offered to buy them an oce cream but I doubt they could have accepted
It used to be Churchill but we're not allowed to say he's a hero anymore
Probably Shakespeare, the Duke of Wellington, Admiral Nelson, Alfred
Horatio Nelson
We even named the main square in London after his achievements
Charles II
Here is a lesser known person who perhaps should be mentioned in this category: William Wilberforce, he was a leading figure in the abolition of slavery debate
Great grandfather was a sergeant in the grenadier guards at the Somme and Paschendale
The imperial war museum have the original copy of a poem he wrote whilst in the tenches of the Somme
WWI & WWII (great grandfather lied about his age for WWI which was common back then because of the propaganda)
Lol whoops
Far as I know, never
Our first prime minister built a hilarious room in his manor that was Roman themed and included a bust of himself in the style of a Roman senator though
Having doors in bathrooms that don’t leave enormous gaps when closed
Every time I go to the US I’m just baffled that people tolerate this
Do you want people looking at you while you shit
So crazy to me
whatsapp
It's only popular in the UK but cricket is pretty much the perfect American sport
It's slow, boring, not much happens, full of natural breaks for advertisements, massively statistical and perfect for the hot and dry weather in a lot of the US
Isn't this more of a southern european thing
You guys need to start an anti-gap campaign
It's all a lot dryer than the UK though, except the Pacific Northwest
Parking is used in English speaking countries
'do you know if there is parking
/ Where is the parking
' can all be interchanged with car park
It's it used in British English
Like ring master
Any fucking airport rail link ever, in any country that I have been to
Actually, trains in general
You can get them reduced with a railcard (you have to buy long in advance), but it's a real shame in my opinion that our train companies have jacked up the prices by such an amount
We could do with fewer cars on the road anyway
Liesester Square to Cohvent Garden
Different exam boards
Why do you learn about the English civil war
That makes zero sense for a country in eastern Europe, but do you learn about Rome as my Romanian mate told me Rome had a massive effect on the Romanian country
How common are gender segregated schools in Ireland
I went to one here and, although they are a thing, they're certainly a minority of schools
I've never really seen it as a good or bad thing however, not inherently better or worse than mixed sex schools
Interesting how they're so common in Ireland
Also, looking through the [Wikipedia article on single-sex schools] I found this which was quite interesting:
> A major longitudinal study of over 17,000 individuals examined whether single-sex schooling made a difference for a wide range of outcomes, including academic attainment, earnings, marriage, childbearing and divorce
[27] The authors found that girls fared better in examinations at age 16 at single-sex schools, while boys achieved similar results at single-sex or co-educational schools
[28] Girls rated their abilities in maths and sciences higher if they went to a girls' school, and boys rated their abilities in English higher if they went to a boys' school, i.e. gender stereotyping was weaker in the single-sex sector
[29] Later in life, women who had been to single-sex schools went on to earn higher wages than women who had been to co-educational schools
[30]
I'm not trying to use this to prove any sort of point by the way, I just thought you might find it interesting
But we're talking culturally
Almost everything
I ordered some pate in a restaurant in Florence and what arrived was
an experience
Haggis is nice but I find it starts to get very heavy after a few bites
As a student this meal has saved me numerous times
When I've been working all day I need something cheap and easy
Beans and sausages on toast with grated cheese is fuckin immense
Hey, I had some decent desserts in the netherlands
And c’mon, everyone likes stroopwafels, right
I’ve only had it once, when I was a teenager still living in the Midlands of England
Dunno where we from it from
haha how French
love it
I dunno, I’ve been to a few pretty swanky restaurants that do specifically do high quality English/British
I was once lucky enough to go to one of Heston Blumenthal’s places that did modernised versions of medieval English cuisine
I ate pigeon
It was fucking delightful
Well, its quite unfortunate but the English flag, St George’s cross is kind of perceived as being a white Anglo-Saxon supremacist symbol
Often, if it wasnt for a sporting event, if you were seen in the street with an English flag, you would be thought of as far-right, nationalist and EDL/Britain First
(Im not a far-righter/right-wing by the way just because my flair flag is England lol)
It's used by the Scout Movement too
I think it's just a meme hardcore racists use to avoid having to use a nazi flag, because a Confederate flag is less well known, and a Nazi flag is seen as unbritish, so even most fascists and extreme right won't use it
Typically, if they were going to fly a flag, what people would fly in the UK, is either a Union flag or a national flag such as a Saint George's Cross
The St George's Cross in England generally either means a sporting event is on, like the World Cup, or the person flying it is quite right wing (but not necessarily extreme)

I learnt it too
Genuinely took be a couple of hours
I love floccinaucinihilipilification
Too bad I learnt it from Jacob Rees sodding Mogg
definitely no country has historical grievances with Britain
I’m sure
can we move on
next question
plz
> Additionally as far as I know no British representative has ever even acknowledged that Britain ever did anything bad to/in Ireland in the past, much less apologised or tried to "settle" the past,
You've probably never looked because they definitely have
Example here:
You wouldn't though, would you
A minority of Welsh people actually want independence
Seems like Spain would be better off focusing on countries like Ireland and Luxembourg who's tax practices siphon vastly more money from the Spanish economy than Gibraltar
That and the fact that most English people today are not bloodthirsty ireland-hating pillagers
Most
> I think one of the greatest tragedies of ireland is also the way the english turned the forests (which remnants are still divinely magical) into sheep pastures
Ireland was already at 12% forest cover by the end of the 16th century
Its a myth that the British or English destroyed all the forests in Ireland
If I were wales I’d take it
>be English
>some old people who happen to share your nationality decide to move somewhere
>get blamed for other people's retirement choices and get called a dirty oppressor for it
Such is life
Ahh, yes, the over 65 brigade that we send in to swing Elections our way
Makes a lot of sense
I'd expect them to put more focus on the most detrimental ones
But they don't because the issue has nothing to do with Gibraltar's tax practices but instead is about Spanish pride, jingoism and nationalism
Gibraltar gets warships in its shore, what do the others get
You actually do recognise Gibraltar as part of the UK, you just don't recognise it as an overseas territory and therefore are unwilling to sign a mutual agreement with the Gibraltarian government
The place wouldn't be useful to the Spanish government if you did, I imagine
Don’t I fucking know it
5% max
The vast majority of Irish deforestation was self-inflicted like every other country
Be english
Be born in a country with an antagonistic relationship with many other countries
Be blamed for
everything
Such is life
Welsh people and Scottish also did a lot of fucked up shit to Ireland so it's also unfortunate that "English" is the teem used to describe stuff that British people did on the whole
My favourite one is being blamed for creating Israel
I think you'd have to be pretty foolish to think the Spanish reaction/position has anything to do with decolonisation considering they have outposts they hold onto that border Morocco
Its all about pride and nationalism
Because they were Catholics basically
If you want go that route: India was British before India existed
Case in point, Ceuta and Melilla are both much older than Spain
Anyways, I'm not criticising Spain for holding on to them, its just hypocritcal for them to point at Gibraltar as a colonised land and demand decolonisation and the transfer of sovereignty whilst they hold onto Ceuta and Melilla
True but most of Europe wasn't a part of the UK or the realm of a British monarch
At the time of the reformation being a catholic was tantamount to being seen as a traitor and agent of the pope
Passports are quite a modern invention and a British Indian passport did exist:  We actually only ever implemented immigration controls towards Commonwealth states in 1962 and previously they were legally allowed to migrate here and work as normal
Ignoring that, back to Gibraltar:
> The only thing special about those territories is they are not part of the iberian peninsula, as Canarias or Baleares
Its exactly the same as Gibraltar
Post 1949 and if they were resident in the UK, then yes
They still can
Its possible they would had been allowed to vote pre-1949 if they swore allegiance to the Crown too but I'm not confident in that
Graz is beautiful, lovely place
I have a friend in Bristol and I've never been; really must When All This Is Over
IMO its not really a shame
I grew up quite literally 2mins walk from the suspension bridge and am very much a Bristolian
In recent years the suspension bridge become part of some sort of 'west country tourist route' and great big coaches full of tourists queue up in the area unload tourists for a photo and then pile them all back on to go off to stonehenge or bath or something
Like, I dont see how its 'a shame' us not having more that sort of thing
It offers nothing to us
Bristol is a wealthy city and doesnt need an income from tourism, nor does it have the roads or public transport to be dealing with any number of tourists
Isn’t there also Eindhoven
Although to be fair I only know that place exists because Ryanair flys there
I think most people know about Lucerne as well
In Sheffield we're twinned with Bochum, and have a long strip of road called 'Bochum parkway'
Extra fun fact, the word of Bairn comes from the Norse settlers word for child, which in Swedish today (probably Norwegian and Danish for that matter) is Barn
Deeper than you'd realise, culturally we're so similar
Late 2019 I travelled round Asia with 2 Germans and a Norwegian, without us speaking you'd have thought we were all from the same country
Average quality of food is bad here
Now that doesn't mean our cuisine is bad
When done well a lot of our food is delicious
It's just that compared to other places we don't have a very good food culture
There are a lot of restaurants that would go out of business in other countries but we have lower standards so they stay afloat
Yeah, we might have a lot of good Michelin starred places but going out for cheap to mid-range food is really hit and miss
As well as this a lot of people have non-existent cooking skills
Growing up it seemed that my mum, as much as I love her, didn't know that food should be seasoned with salt or that there was another way to have vegetables than steamed to mush
We're far more right wing than our immediate neighbours and we're dragging them down with us
> Sadly
Yep true
You mean like Scotland who legalised homosexuality 30 years after England
Not really though
>Implying being right wing is a bad thing
What are YOU doing here
Well of course there are exceptions
And to be fair that was a long time ago
I’m talking about present day
I mean yeah though
Yeah
I would hardly say FAR more
Maybe a bit more
I would say far more
This is why the uk Supreme Court which we only set up last decade can be so important - as seen in the pro-roguing controversy last year
It’s good to have an authority who can adjudicate which possible law takes precedent constitutionally
That would be *squirrel*, which is pronounced /ˈskwɪɹəl/. Not sure about non-native speakers but Americans seem to have some trouble :)
Nothing interested here but my mum pronounces squirrel like sqarrel
Haha
Out of curiosity, what part is it that you find difficult about it, what trips you up
Is it the /skw-/ (are other words like *square* and *squeeze* difficult too)
Is it the proximity of the /w/ and the /ɹ/ so they get mixed up
I think I might do that myself from time to time and end up accidently saying 'scrirrel' :)
Ah I get you
I'm the same in French with your R. Like, I can do it, but in certain words it sure does trip me up
Are you referring to the different ways of pronouncing it
Like voiced [ʁ] vs voiceless [χ] allophones
Or the older trill pronunciations [ʀ] and [r]
Since I'm pretty sure there's only one r phoneme in French
Ah got you
Again I can pronounce both but I do have to concentrate sometimes
Pronouncing a word in isolation: fine, actual conversation: all goes out the window haha
I think I have a bit of a tendancy to use the voiceless [χ] by default when speaking for some reason even when I shouldn't, if I'm not being careful
In fact it sometimes ends up being a voiceless trill [ʀ̥] instead
Haha cheers :) I hope so but I don't practise my French nearly enough
Come to think of it, maybe I should make use of the extra time I've got with the lockdown and focus on it a bit
Maybe I'll see some progress haha
Like my grandma used to say
“Shelf in the shop
Fridge in the home”
Golly, she loved eggs
Killed her in the end
Same, big wooden bowl
We probably get through three dozen or more per week, so it's handy to have them handy
Conversely, I've never seen anyone keep them in the fridge
Yeah, for like 6-12
Our family can easily get through three dozen a week
Not the person you replied to, but lots of Asian soups feature egg
Milk or water in first when making a cup of tea
Silly and useless argument because water in first is objectively correct
scones - on *two* fronts
one, pronunciation: scon or scoan
two, preparation: jam first, cream second (cornish way), or cream first, jam second (devonian way)
(the correct answer: scons are made jam first)
wtf is a ‘soft k’? How do you make ‘k’ soft
I like Czechia, but it’s not my decision to make
Supper
I’m from the midlands and tend to use both for some reason
Not gonna lie, but this is basically me with British English vs American English
So I can totally understand why
I can't believe you've done this
Well the sugar first if you take it
Otherwise it'll get all over the teabag and hinder the infusion process
Yeah of course
We're not savages
I wish it was just a meme
You should get a brew made by my missus
I've tried to teach her
My dad does
He used to lecture me on how I was wrong when I put the milk in first
I should have called childline
Frauds, the lot of them
Are you fucking serious
To be fair, our tea is very strong black tea that can be very bitter without a dash of milk
It's not like we're putting it in fruity teas that lots of other nations have
Jesus Christ, why am I so pathetic that the idea of microwaving water made me angry
Nope just a dash of cold milk at the end
No, that way it helps cool the tea a bit
can we claim Mr Brightside
please
i know it's an American song but it feels like such a big part of British culture at this point
I think for England though it's probably a couple of the big Oasis songs, guaranteed to get the whole pub singing along
Ah dude 500 miles is deffo on that list above
Having been Interrailing twice, once in 2018 and once in 2019, for 2 weeks each, there is no distance which would be too far for me to travel by train
In 2018 for example we left our house in the north of England and travelled round Europe for 2 weeks
Think it was England - Bruges - Berlin - Prague - Krakow - Vienna - Venice - Rome (+ a visit to Pompeii) - Paris - back to England
All on train, not a single flight involved
The furthest distance there would be Pompeii at 1495 miles from my house
I must also add that, even though I’ve been on around 25 flights in my life, including to Australia and back, I developed a fear of flying around 7 years ago and will now only get on a plane if absolutely necessary
The new Charlie and the Chocolate movies
Hearing that little British kid call a plaster a ‘band aid’ _physically hurt_.
Btw our go to exclamation in response to an American freaking out hasn’t been “Don’t get your knickers in a twist” for about 4 decades and to be honest it wasn’t really that common to begin with
I also love in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves when Kevin Costner and Christian Slater barely even attempted English accents, let alone East Midlands or Nottinghamshire accents
Just a couple of modern American dudes hanging out in Sherwood
Also, About Time is a cutesy, quirky British rom com and whatnot but you have to understand - the people in that film are rich
They are very wealthy
They represent the top, like, 10% of the population _if that_. They have a fucking tennis court in amongst ruins for christ sake
And they acted like him sharing a home with a _fucking playwright_ was him slumming it through uni
hilarious
It’s a delightful cinematic metaphor isn’t it
Hah
bingo
I haven't ridden a bike in years
I'm not quite sure when I learnt but I was never the strongest at it
I reckon I would be pretty wobbly at first if I got on one now, being completly out of practice
I learnt to ride a bike about 5-6
When I was 3 or 4
One of my earliest memories is actually of looking back towards my step sister when I was learning, riding into a kerb and falling off
It's not
It's because we call you frogs and so you call us what we eat
Roast beef
You sound like my very right-wing English father
“Overall Bloody Sunday was considered a victory for the IRA, as Collins's operation severely damaged British intelligence, while the later reprisals did no real harm to the guerrillas but increased support for the IRA at home and abroad
Bit of background
Why do you say English instead of British
I mean
offense
Come out and fight me like a man
; ) no worries
oi watch your language
But in terms of British military presence in Ireland there was no difference
You’ve actually had [three]
I think people get a bit over excited about it if I'm honest
WW2 is a fascinating saga in history, but European countries have a couple of thousand years of national history to cover
People often complain here that "we don't learn about this event or that event"....Britain has a very big history
English nationalists and Brexiteers love to talk about the Battle of Britain, the 'Blitz Spirit' and standing up to Hitler alone as if they have some equivalence to Brexit, dealing with the economic fallout and standing up to the EU
Definitely the british empire, which actually is quite weird because of how many atrocities it had committed
What do Greeks think of the whole Megali Idea these days
A major misunderstanding of the 100 years war is that it was England vs France
It was much more a dynasty war, and if 'England' had won, it would have been the junior partner in a union with France
All English Kings in that period lived in the French territories
They saw themselves as French
So in a way, it was an English victory, as the loss meant the English weren't vassals to the French King anymore
Try telling them that
Game is super traditional British food but its not actually that common
You'll find it in most traditional gastro pubs especially if they're in the countryside but its not that common in home cooking
Goose is sometimes the bird of choice over turkey at Christmas
Pigeon and other game birds are very common among the rural population
Wood pigeon have meat to die for
I was lucky enough to go to one of Heston Blumenthal’s restaurants once that was themed around medieval English cuisine
I had pigeon there and it was fucking immense
That said, the only time I eat poultry other than chicken these days is duck in Asian dishes or turkey at Christmas
Not sure how accurate this is but I view duck as a staple of French cuisine
Is it super common to eat in France
Remember there are different breeds of pigeon, when one eats pigeon its not the sort you find eating out of a bin in the middle of a city
Pigeons that you eat look a bit more [like this]
That's not a dove
It's a king pigeon
Looks like some nondescript town in the American midwest
Yeah it happened to me when I went to university
Apparently the way I pronounce my 'ar's in words like garden and car is weird
Had people properly dying of laughter at the pub every time I said the word garden
I didn't think I had a strong accent but sometimes people form London can be a bit sheltered to regional accents
Yes, I'm from barnsley (close to Sheffield)
We get this because we miss out loads of letters in words, and have a wired accent compared to the rest of the area
Sorry bruv I can’t speak irn bru
Do you speak Breton Gaelic
Where in Ireland are you from
Carlow or Cavan then
It's the same in England yeah
I've a mate from Donegal that told me his wife's Dublin family struggle with his accent
Cork accents are the strangest Irish accents to me
I think they sound more like Welsh accents than other Irish ones
I went in January 2016 when I was 17 with my dad and sister
The skyscrapers were huge, the architecture was beautiful, and everything was fantastic
We stayed near Times Square so we went there everyday and it never got old
Times Square at night and early morning (around 8am) was something else, the lights at night and quietness in the morning, it was beautiful
What we found crazy was crossing the roads
Just cars being over the crossing every now and then was something to get used to - it’s generally not a thing that happens in the UK
We didn’t travel on the subway as we didn’t feel the need to - we just walked everywhere
We do wish that we got a bus pass though to see Ground Zero and other things further away from us
We went to Madame Tussauds, the Natural History Museum, Intrepid, Museum of Modern Art, Central Park, the Empire State Building and other stuff
The Natural History Museum was bigger than we thought, we spent the majority of the opening hours the day before we left, and felt like we needed more time as we didn’t get to see everything
It was massive
Also, I took $500 and came back with $12 lol
It’s not cheap haha
I do want to go there again, hopefully within the next few years I’ll get the chance and money to go
It’s breathtaking
So beautiful and grand
Never been to a city that towers over you like that
London is beautiful, but the skyscrapers we have here are less numerous and usually a lot shorter
I got to see the Seagram Building in real life, having wrote about it and its designer, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, in essays during my time at university
Getting to just walk around and admire the beautiful architecture was genuinely one of my favourite parts of the trip
Shoot need to go to NYC to answer this question
I'll be back in 50 hours
You know Turkey has made a huge comeback in tourism and ranked 8th worldwide which is really cool
All those positive comments just to see a 7
5/10 lol
> alot of weird people,
Are you talking about how busy people are
It’s logical but less romantic
I like how you can get a bit lost in European cities
But friends with benefits literally means fuck buddies
Like theres nothing innocent about it accept the lack of swearing
Yeah, the damn sun set last night, angry af
Don't worry about it too much
I got punched in the face by a British guy in Britain
Possibly for a fellow Brit
We sure are a contentious people
I have a Polish girlfriend who has introduced me to disco polo and have to say (unironically) that I like it, and am particularly a fan of some of the songs by Skaner, Boys and Akcent
Sadly I have been less successful in my attempts to reciprocate with getting her into my favourite genre (drum and bass)
Many Australians and Canadians also used to refer to England as the motherland, not many do anymore though
Typically it was because of their own struggles, now we aren’t the world superpower I don’t think they could care less, I’d take it as a compliment honestly
Russia being called the motherland is pretty fucking badass though
Mother Russia is something I’d wear on my sleeve and wear with pride
Nah, a lot of Aussies don’t even like the Queen
The most common insult in Australia which every Aussie will say to a Brit is ‘Pom’ derived from the word ‘Pome’ (prisoner of mother England), because most Aussies originate from England
I've never seen them like that in my life
I’ve seen them in school but they arent that common here I’ve never had one is my house
Nobody has those windows in the UK
Certainly they are extremely uncommon, ive never seen them or know anyone who has them, theyre not a thing here anyhow
In the uk we either have old style Georgian windows(which open straight up) or more modern windows(which are the kind which open sideways but outwards) etc
Sort of thing you’d get in apartments/offices/schools built after 2000
We don’t tend to have them on houses because they look unattractive on Victorian houses

Exurb1a’s content is really enjoyable, quite philosophical, but funny at the same time
I believe he also writes books
Edit: turns out he is/was/will be in court for a rape, that’s changed my opinion a bit
Obviously England, not sure where, it’s hard to pinpoint
I don’t get what you mean by connecting the words, doesn’t seem different to any other accent, I could be wrong though
Surely from the south east though, don’t beat me up if I’m wrong
Those are all shit tbh
Ikr
I love his channel but i don’t know if I can see him the same from now, guess innocent till proven guilty
I guess why I couldn’t see anything weird about it is because that’s how I speak aha, I’d say it like ‘kick-toff’ as well, for reference I live in Sussex, which is in the south east of England, we like to shorten our Ts, mostly at the end of a word (I know this doesn’t have a T), this is called a T-glottalisation
I guess it’s similar to that, it’s just easier to say ‘kick-toff’ because it reduces the time taken to say the word
I hope that made sense, it’s late and I feel like this won’t read well
I just find them really obnoxious and not funny and also that whole genre of video is really boring
I’m not sure, I’ll have a look
It’s ongoing in the Netherlands, not sure about the Bulgarian case
Yeah, it’s such a shame I used to always look forward to his uploads :( hope these allegations aren’t true
Probably 50-50 or *maybe* 60-40 in favour of dogs nationally
Personally I prefer cats
Less mess to clear up, low maintenance and if you get the right cat they can be almost as affectionate as dogs
I like both but in a dog man through and through and I believe the UK as a whole is a dog nation, we've created a large percentage of the current recognised breeds
Neither
I like dogs more but I’m not really much of an animal person in general
> Are you a cat or dog person
Both
> Which do you think your country prefers
Both
> Which do you think the continent prefers
Maybe cats
Yes, probably because they're low maintenance
I always make sure do to this with Bees
Why those furry little fellows enjoy the pavements of London so much i dont know
Depending on what definition of country you're using (United Kingdom vs England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland), Cornish, Welsh, Scots Gaelic and Gaelic
Umm, in the uk we have something called scouse
Yes
But that’s less dependant on the country I live in, and more the fact that I live in a small village
Only one bus comes through here and it goes to a nearby town and that’s it, obviously I have more places to go that just one town so yeah, a car is pretty important
I’m not sure if it is still a law but it was that any English man could kill a Scots man in York if he was holding a bow and arrow
Or something like that
It's known as [pannage] Apparently it's still done in some places such as the New Forest
My secondary school was built in the 18th century, so were two places I've worked in since then
My town was named in the Domesday book (1086), but nothing of import was really made or done there until the industrial Revolution
Jesus was it 400 years
That is a long time
Yeah I feel like 'Roman Britain' is spoken about so casually that you'd think it start and ended within a generation or 2
Yes the Eddas were Norse myths and tales written down by Icelandic authors, however they were written after Christianisation so they should be taken with a pinch of salt
That being said, the Eddas are much more reliable than many poeple give them credit for
Only was taught about the EU in Geography along with the EU member states
That's all
The EU was definitely not studied in any detail at my School, it may have been mentioned in PSHE (citizenship element), but honestly not even sure of that
Contactless
I don't know how much of a "thing" this is but as a child I remember being made to say "sausages" or "silly sausages" quite a bit
That's in addition to "cheese" which we use too
Most unique by far, haha
> When you meet someone from Northern Ireland, the unspoken rule is that you're not supposed to ask "Protestant or Catholic
"Actually, I'm Buddhist
"Aye, but are ye a *Protestant* Buddhist or a *Catholic* Buddhist
For the UK, generally, it's "so, what do you think about Brexit
Politics and religion
Never good conversation starters
> the unspoken rule is that you're not supposed to ask "Protestant or Catholic
I mean it'd be super weird to ask that to anyone no matter where they're from

I’m proud of Wales, i know the feeling is not reciprocated but anytime I see stuff like this I’m always like this im aways proud of Wales
* Something like 40-50% of the entire Earth's cider market is exclusively made up of just the UK
* The UK by far consumes the most cider in the world too, to the point where it's not even close, the UK drinks about 820 million litres of cider a year
No other country on Earth gets anywhere near
It's the cider capital of the world, both in terms of production and consumption
I would cry because the beloved fish and chips would no longer exist
Export wheat from the Irish, duh
If France is ordering snails, the UK wants an opt out of the starter
>We would be in a nearby table with Northern Macedonia waiting for France and Netherlands to let us sit at the main table
The UK is going to force you to sit with Kosovo
Look, Buckfast (Monk-made fortified wine) is better than Trappist Monk beer, even Scotland agrees on that
We would then move you closer to Germany halfway through
We brought the finest English sparking wine,  Carling beer, roast beef, and chips topped with Cheddar cheese
What is wrong with you
Ffs France undercooked the meat again, and has brought French food, gonna need to get massively drunk and buy a Kebab from Turkey at 3am
England invented chips, Mayo does not go on chips, only salt, vinegar or Cheddar Cheese
PS Belgium: we can send you the Cadbury team to help you make better chocolate
Sorry, we have already invited our cousin from Belfast William Ulsterman, you'll have to spend all dinner arguing with him instead
Bad news, William Ulsterman won't sit next to Ireland, and is kicking off with France because they refuse to serve him Cheddar Cheese with Pineapple on a stick
Imagine thinking England would care what France thinks about food "fuck off France, you can't cook beef properly, everyone knows Cheddar is the best cheese in the world anyway, the only good French cheese is Brie and they can make that better in Somerset now
Would you like to calm down with a nice pint of Carling or Doom Bar
Pretty standard for the UK too
Fuck it, ordering a Kebab off Turkey anyway, not eating any of that gross foreign food from France
We will very kindly offer to share our English sparkling wine, Carling Beer, and Buckfast wine (Scotland will just drink all of that, and then smash the party up'
Would you like to buy some Lincolnshire sausage
It's the best in the world
Buckfast gets you fucked fast
It's probably the only wine with caffeine added into it, down a bottle or two of it and you are drunk all night and awake till 10am
Can't catch me, I've already flown out to Mallorca to get my towels on the sunbeds for my holiday in August before the Germans get there
The Opium Wars
Definitely the 100 years war or the wars with our neighbours we have
Instead we learn about a fat fuck with his 8 wives and some tune about it I've forgot right after I left school (that was like a few months ago, first year of college)
I feel like we leave a lot of important stuff out of history, but I don't feel like anything we learnt was pointless either
Unless we dedicate more time to learning history, I think important events are always going to be missed out
Yes, I had no idea they had even happened
Didn't learn about them till I saw a documentary as an adult
There's a lot of important stuff they miss out of history at school
Normally I'd say Kommissar Rex but I'm actually quite enjoying the new Canadian remake, even if it is a little more straight-faced
Edit: oh, but Camera Caffè was cool, I feel like we could do that idea well
I wish there was a british version of the office
Possibly with ricky Gervais
Sometimes yeah but also sometimes great films can be made
For Example The Departed is a great film and probably better than Infernal Affairs
Inbetweeners would be great or even shameless
I hope thats a joke
Depends on what sort of comedy you like
The comparison between the two shows really highlights [what Stephen Fry is saying here]
I've seen countless comments on /r/TIL that British accents used to sound American but we changed them as to not sound American
Or that everyone in the UK called it soccer, until it became popular in the US during the 90s, so we started using football as to not sound American
Utter bollocks on both accounts
Same with Birmingham in the UK, which Fox News declared a ‘no-go zone for non-Muslims’.
Speaking personally, there are plenty of reasons why I avoid Birmingham, but a de facto ban on non-muslims is not one of them
To be fair, the reaction in the UK was so intense that Fox had to issue an apology
> The KGB were scary and terrible but they weren't literally everywhere, listening on people through doors
Sure, but I guess the question is whether people *believed* they were
What idea is that
Someone was trying to tell me there were no go areas in London
I asked for actual locations, postcodes, a map etc
Silence
Somerset/West Country, it's one of the ones that's rhotic
people at the BBC and the hospitals he donated to knew what he was getting up to as well
Eh, I kinda think that one was expected
more of a maybe nah definitely nonce
Don't think so, or at least no one I knew went to them
Did know a few people who became camp counselors in America though, but they were just doing it as an excuse to get laid and have a holiday in America
No, although there are now summer play/activity schemes so you warehouse your kids during the day so you can go to work, which is what I assume summer camps are really for
My parents used to send us to our grandparents' place for half the summer holidays
Nah that's where american kids go to be bullied
They Def exist but you'd unlikely go on one for longer then a week or two
Once a year for a check-up, and I usually would have the hygienist on the same day
Usually a 1 time checkup followed by a hygienist appointment
Honestly tempted to just drop the checkup because the dentist never says anything the hygienist doesn't then just repeat
We learn about Poland in terms of the post WW2 era and the agreement between Churchill and Stalin on the borders in England when we are 15-16
What is definitely not taught in America is that the USSR did most of the actual fighting, if anyone they get most of the credit
US teachers also cover a lot more about the pacific, which was much more US dominated, covering it as an equal front to Europe, and seem to cover very little to nothing regarding the largely British led conflict in North Africa
it could be part to do with religion
Europe is lesser religious and more tolerant of gay folk etc
This appears to be incompatible with certain religious beliefs
Unfortunately there is a growing stigma associated with anybody having a middle eastern or African appearance wearing certain attire
You will find though that many folk will be accepting of you if you embrace the countries culture and adhere to their laws
Sooner you learn their language and make an effort to work in whichever country, you will find most people will open up to you and treat you just like everybody else
It's sad that the situation is like this but that is the reality sadly
London is a melting pot if international significance, but doesn't represent rUK at all, less than 50% of its pop is actual white English, whereas rUK is more like 90%+ except from certain areas in thr larger cities
Washing once a day is the norm
Twice maybe if there's some particular reason you're dirty or sweaty and you've already washed once that day
Some people wash less than once a day; IIRC my dad washes every other day, which isn't unheard of
But once a day is most common I think
I'm somewhat surprised how few people here say they take baths
I didn't think they were that unusual
Personally I alternate between having a shower one day and a bath the next
I just like the calming and relaxing aspect of it
Incidentally I also always wash in the evenings myself, whether bath or shower, though I think showering in the morning is also common
I generally shower once a day, sometimes I may not, or sometimes I will have two showers (if i’ve exercised usually)
Baths I’d have maybe once a month, I like long ones so I don’t have them too often
I shower pretty much every day
Might not always do it at the weekend unless I'm going somewhere in the evening
Our house does
We never used to but i was watching some food videos from Korea and they use scissors for everything and holy shit it makes everything so much easier
Anything that only needs a rough chop i use scissors for now
My parents had a pizza cutter, but my bf introduced me to cutting with scissors and that works great
I do and it's so much easier, I live in italy and I get some weird looks though
Perhaps it’s more effective/easier
With a cutter I find you have to roll it back and forth to actually cut through the pizza, whereas with scissors its much quicker and you have to apply less force
Answering your original question, I’ve heard of people in the UK use scissors to cut them, but not as many as those who use a pizza cutter (and if you are in a restaurant like Pizza Express you always get given a cutter to use)
Tough call - I want to jump to the obvious choices of Augustus/Trajan/Hadrian but I’m going to pick Claudius
He had spent his whole life being belittled as stupid/mentally challenged because of a speech defect (which is probably the reason he was kept alive tbh) and managed to pick up the complete shitshow that had been left to him by Caligula
Other favourites include Vespasian - for somehow stopping the empire from completely collapsing after the chaos of the third century
Marcus Aurelius - who gifted the world a huge amount of philosophical texts and was by all accounts a calm, collected and just ruler - never making rash decisions beyond choosing Commodus as a successor
Controversially - Julian
For giving paganism, and the attached rationality one last hurrah before being subsumed for 1100-1200 years in Europe by Theodosius’ banning of Polytheism
Big fan - his passing marked the death knell of the Roman Empire for me
The third century killed off a lot of lustre of Rome and the outlawing of Polytheism and the linked philosophical study truly transferred Rome from antiquity to medieval
I think Marcus Aurelius's reign is always going to be tainted by Commodus and the following Crisis of the Third Century . I think that is partly unfair because you can see the beginnings of Crisis during his reign, he was just a very competent emperor
I think its because the religion was in most of Europe brought in by aid of the sword
Most areas became majority Christian only after crusade or persecution
Whereas the various Polytheistic religions that were indigenous to Europe all had a lot in common and were largely tolerant of additional gods being admitted from outside influences
Generally speaking they were all descended from a common Proto-Indo-European religion
Be it Druidism/Norse Paganism/Hellenism
They gradually diverged as their root cultures did but all had similarities and you often saw local cults to Celtic/Germanic gods being added into the wider Roman Pantheon in frontier regions
On the other hand - the Abrahamic religions were not tolerant of other gods so synthesis could never occur
It was ‘believe in my god or you’re a devil worshipper’
Interestingly - the abrahamic religions are actually based off the old Semitic Polytheism
Whereas one old god became the true god - all the others became demons
On a side note - I think Scottish history only coincides with Christianity as it was the Goidelic speaking Scots who brought it over from Ireland around the 5th/6th century
The Picts who were already in Caledonia were thought to be Brythonic speaking - ie more like Welsh/Cornish than the Irish (unlike modern Scottish Gaelic)
Theodosius was one of the worst (of those that lasted years rather than months)
Finally outlawing Polytheism and the associating Rationalism
I live in England, in the UK, everyone looks down on every other country and region and county and town pretty much
Where I live
I just say to people I live in Ali-G town
Slough
It’s mainly just business estates, and is in general really boring
Well, I’m from Nottinghamshire, which has a pretty significant rivalry with the neighbouring county of Derbyshire
On account of a famous English folk song called “The Derby Ram”, the ram was long ago adopted as a symbol of the city (and the county more generally)
As a result, we in Nottinghamshire naturally began suggesting that Derbyshire’s love of sheep was indeed carnal, and that the denizens of Derbyshire actually fuck sheep
I grew up referring to Derbyshire people, and especially supporters of Derby County football club, as “sheep-shaggers”.
Meanwhile, the rest of the UK was using the same insult against the Welsh, based on their tradition of sheep-farming, a fact of which I only became aware in my teens
Even today when I hear the term “sheep-shagger” part of me thinks about Derbyshire, even though the rest of the country will immediately associate it only with Wales
And also because of what the city looks like
Its a very grey city
> Bielefeld does not exist
I've heard of this, heard of it a few years back after Angela Merkel mentioned it
Thought it was pretty funny
All industries in the UK tend to be clustered within London so it would be silly to create 50 different names for London so we don't.
For a while, our film industry was "Kenneth Branagh and friends"
The BBC
And in England there's Silicon Fen around Cambridge
Communists are right about plenty of things
People just forget
Partially because of its failings and partially because of anti soviet propaganda
It's a bit erratic in English (there's a surprise)
In general, we use "local" names, but it's a relatively recent switch, within the last century, so there are some historical people who we use anglicised or latinised names
Holy Roman Emperor Charles V isn't "Karl" or "Carlos" with his Spanish hat on
The chap who got shot in Sarajevo is Franz Ferdinand and the Emperor was Franz Josef, though you will still see older books and contemporary sources calling them Francis Ferdinand and Francis Joseph
Likewise, we tend to talk about Kaiser Wilhelm II rather than Emperor William II, but the latter shows up in older books and newspapers of the time
Russian tsars get anglicised pretty much all the time, it's Nicholas and Michael, not Nikolai and Mikhail *except* for Ivans, who don't become John
Possibly because "Ivan" has been adopted into English as a name in its own right
Birmingham and Liverpool are nowhere near as bad as people say they are
Belfast for sure
Been glamourised as some sectarian ghetto where murders are simply a daily occurrence by people who have never been there
City is brilliant
People are friendly
Yes even if you're English
Northern England
I don't think anyone overseas thinks that it is
Shoreditch etc is a major tourist attraction
I don't think any of those areas are really known outside of the uk, actually I don't even think people who live outside of London even know of them
no and yes
We bring in a bag of sweets or chocolate for the office when we come back from holiday
Usually from the place we’ve been, so baklava from Greece etc
I’m not sure how common it is as i’ve only come across it once so far
Also common here in more arty industries

There's a lot to choose from for UK music, but my current recommendation would be Royal Blood
They've a good mix of lighter and heavier stuff (sometimes the lighter stuff veers more into dance territory) and a very unique sound, as the guitar they use is actually a bass
The entirety of their 1st album, [Royal Blood] PLX1f6VBU1RGVYtz29ZlawG9N83wysKQZS) is very good and all rock, and although I haven't listened to a great deal of their newer stuff, I quite enjoy [Boilermaker] [Limbo] and [Lights Out]

oooo law graduate here and I have THE TEA
R V BROWN [1993]
So basically, there was this group of gay sadomasochistic men who had been prosecuted for GBH
The reasoning behind the charge was that they had been performing extremely harmful (albeit consensual) acts
The acts were so gruesome that it’s actually pretty difficult to find out the details, but apparently it included acts such as putting nails into their japs eyes (penis hole)
At the time, the question for the court was “to what level of harm can a person consent
” the House of Lords deemed that this level of harm you can’t consent to
There has been a lottt of controversy in this case though, as during the case they mention the need to “protect family values” in conjunction with the fact they were homosexual, and later cases with similar material facts but where the defendants were heterosexual were actually ruled in favour of the defendant
Consequently a lot of legal professionals take the view that the court at that time didn’t actually take issue with the level of harm so much as the fact they were gay
In my opinion if they were all consenting, let them do what they want
Various studies show that is social welfare that helps the poor and giving money to those who are begging usually end up in the hands of criminals
Carbolic is a good one
Important to note *history* not law books
I’m just giving famous court cases that we learn about in law school
Well it does say court cases, not historic punishments

There's only a few countries with 5th generation jets
India is planning on having one in the mid 2020s, weather that is a sure bet to happen or not I don't know
Im sure things have changed since i left school 14 years ago but I can remember;
Of Mice and Men
Macbeth
Romeo and Juliet
I think we also briefly did Othello
When I did my GCSEs (end of high school exams) we did Macbeth, An Inspector Calls, A Christmas Carol and War and Conflict Poetry
The school gets to choose what they do from 4 categories: Shakespeare, 19th Century Novel, Modern Prose or Drama, and Poetry
The exam makers have a list of the Texts allowed to be picked in those categories
Before GCSEs we read alsorts which would be mostly dependent on the school
I read: Coraline, I'm the King of the Castle, Christmas Carol, etc
It was mostly English texts and not texts from other English speaking countries such as the USA or Australia but we did read the odd foreign text occasionally
I'm 33 so things will have changed but the best I can recall is: we read **a scene** from *Macbeth*; we read **a scene** from *Romeo & Juliet*; we read **[something, not the whole book]** from *The Time Machine*; we read **a poem** by two modern UK poets (Edit 3: Simon Armitage and Carol Ann Duffy)
Yeah, my school wasn't great
Edit: I ignored the rest of the class and just sat and read the whole of *The Time Machine*. I also got an F or a G in my English Literature GCSE
I printed off an essay from online to submit as my coursework because I suck at coursework
In my exam I wrote my name, about a paragraph on whatever shit we were supposed to write about, then put my head down for about an hour and a half and ignored the rest of it
I actually like to read but fuck disecting a goddamn scene, just let me read the fucking book and enjoy and appreciate it
I'm not disparaging the studying of literature but it has to be done right (i.e. **actually reading the fucking book**) and my school sucked giant donkey balls at it
Edit 2: I do like to read but I'm not going to pretend I'm well read
Off the top of my head the following are books I've read in their entirety:
* *The Time Machine*
* *1984* (twice)
* *Animal Farm*
* *Keep The Aspidistra Flying*
* The Orwell book where the daughter of a vicar works on a farm
* *Norwegian Woods*
* *Crime And Punishment*
* *Men Without Women*
* *The Count Of Monte Cristo*
* The Harry Potter series
* *The Hobbit*
* *Pride And Prejudice*
* The first two books of the Game of Thrones series
* *Blood Song*, *Queen Of Fire* and *Tower Lord*
* *A Dance Of Cloaks* There's two other books in that saga/series(?)
I've read them but can't remember the name
* *Waking Fire*
* Two books from the Sharpe series
They were both set in South America IIRC
Plus about 4 or 5 others who's name I can't remember
I've also started several books but not finished them
I've read *The Lord Of The Rings* as far as Shelob's cave
How much of them did you actually read (as part of the curriculum, not independently)
Just remembered I read holes which I think was most likely written in the USA
How much of them did you actually read (as part of the curriculum, not independently)
How much of them did you actually read (as part of the curriculum, not independently)
Better than my school
We read a scene from *Macbeth* (I think), a scene from *Romeo And Juliet* and a chapter or two from *The Time Machine*. Plus two - maybe three - poems by modern UK poets

Financial company so I get;
Discount on banking products,
Employee mortgage (this is huge, saves me £5k/year, easily),
Car lease scheme that comes from gross pay, not net, so it saves a considerable amount on tax
Private health care (to a certain limit),
Car breakdown cover,
Mobile phone insurance,
Travel insurance,
And my journey to and from work is paid for (train/taxi fare or petrol)
There's a bunch of other odds and ends, but the mortgage tracks the bank of England base rate, so 0
75% currently
Oh, browsing through the other replies, I remembered:
Doubled pension contributions; if I put in 20, they put in 40
Access to discounted shares with a price floor ( that floor looks pretty goddamn handy right now )
Doubled share contributions without a price floor (would need to lose more than 50% share price before this could be bad value)

Sorry I can't understand a word you're saying
Jamaican/Caribbean dialect can be hard to understand
If they go full on patois it's almost impossible to understand
Australian/American/Canadian/New Zealand/South African/Indian/Jamacian/Caribbean/Hong Kong/Singapore/Nigerian/Ghanian etc etc
Its all very easy to understand tbh
Ive yet to have any real difficulties in understanding
Australians/Americans/Canadians/Kiwis especially are extremely easy to understand
Their accents and versions of English really are no different to British english
Caribbean, African, Asian & Indian Englishes can much more difficult to understand only when they move away from English and go into more of a pattois/English-local language dialect hybrid etc that can be very hard to impossible to understand
But outside of that i think most Brits have no difficulty understanding the English spoken in any of the countries i mentioned
If anything other thick regional British accents are actually harder to understand than say an Aussie or American
Have more trouble with English dialects than non British ones
Aus, SA, NZ, CA, US all easy
If you count Pidgin and Patois then maybe for sure they're pretty much unintelligible for the British
Not at all
I've heard that Venezuelan accents and dialects are especially hard to understand, is that true
TIL it's just coriander
Heard it a couple times in American media, just thought it was me not knowing shit about cooking
Je ne connaissais pas le mot 'plouc' haha
Merci
Mais oui, tu as tout à fait raison
Nope
I still can't make it out
Pretty easy, there are some weird dialects there, but you can usually work it out from Context
In my experiences further North Accents are harder because we have a habit of mixing words into one, so it can be more difficult to get the context in the first place
For example in the Midlands, many informal dialects remove the Definate article and de emphasise parts of words
For example, an older Dialect:
*You're going to Nottingham yeah
Take this and give it to the police
Thanks*
Sounds like:
*Goin Nott'num yeah, cop'ouda dis n'and it ta filth, Taduck
Most people don't speak like this unless they know you'll understand, so we rarely have problems
unless it's *regional inner london vernacular* (ie
degenerate chavspeak) the most difficult dialects are from the north of england, especially newcastle
Actually, I disagree
I find Americans much harder to understand in real life than on TV
The pace of speech really throws me off

The battle of Hastings 1066
I think that sown the seeds of our class division
The idea idea that our ruling class are actually a different people
To be honest, we've had so many major historical events that there's not one single culturally defining one
I feel like I could name 10 equally important events
Battle of Edington which defeated the Vikings and helped form the creation of England, Battle of Hastings, The Black Death, the English Reformation, Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Battle of Waterloo and the wider Napoleonic wars which fostered the British identity, even the Battle of Plassey that provided the UK with enormous influence over the Indian subcontinent and later the world, and of course WW2 (mainly the Blitz and D-Day)
It is impossible to name one as being more important than another in the shaping of who we are
I learned about it in my grade 12 English class in Canada
We were taught that the Norman rule defined so much of the English language and culture

Everyone know the London museums so I'm going to pitch in some museums outside of London:
National Coal Mining Museum (you get to go down a mine)
National Railway Museum (They have trains)
National Armouries (They have armour and weapons)
National Science and Media Museum (They've got a Walace and Gromit set)
National Space Museum (They have a rocket in a tower with the cafe underneath)
Crich Tramway museum (You can ride an old double decker team)
Bletchley Park (Place where they broke codes in WW2
Black Country Living Museum (Life in the Black Country (near Birmingham))
Imperial War museum (war)
All of these are brilliant and most are days out all on there own
I'm a bit of a museum need
Edit: Fixed formatting
NCMM is a great shout
It really is something we should be proud of
Especially as they are free
Fun fact: Fried chicken like KFC etc well its actually a British invention, more specifically it was created in Scotland, and they then brought that to America, where iirc the world famous seasoning aspect came from the slaves with their African culinary tradition, and the two(Scottish fried chicken, the technique and the African seasoning techniques then combined, melded together to form the KFC style fried chicken we know today
It could be said it's a fusion food combing two very different culinary styles(Scottish and African) yet the two go perfectly together)
I digress, [here's the original British fried chicken, here it is from 1736(although that's just when it was written down in a recipe book, it probs dates back even earlier just undocumented)
But to answer your question
KFC is literally everywhere here
Every major city and town has many multiple KFCs
They're definitely part of the landscape here
We also have many non-KFC fried chicken places that basically make the same food as KFC too, there's even more of them
Tbh it's not that nice, most KFCs and fried chicken places are best avoided
The quality of the food is often awful(although it's a franchise, so whether the food quality is good or not depends on which KFC your at, but still it's annoying how the food quality is not consistent across the various KFCs)
But to clarify KFC is extremely prevalent in England/The UK
Hmm
I wonder if a gyros with McDonald's chips would be any good
Although in my experience McD is more highly trafficked, due to the fact that it is cheaper and has a better customer experience
It depends what you mean by "cook" tbh
I'm 22 and would say I'm average for a guy from the UK in terms of cooking skill
I can make basic meals, like full English breakfasts, Spaghetti Bolognese, various meals with Chicken and rice or chicken and potatoes etc, made fried chicken and fish and chips and burgers during the lockdown too, homemade pizzas etc
What I can't do, is make big 'family' style meals, or cook steaks (but that's because my studio flat has a crap electric cooker)
Not Northern Ireland
Lmao so many people are forgetting that in the comments its funny
Wooooah
An American admitting that *anyone* besides themselves did something to help win the war
What is this
A lot, it varies pretty much everywhere but I personally find London influences pretty much the entire country in some way
Having been born and raised well outside of London only to move here a few years ago, I have to say it’s much better
London is more interesting, diverse, convenient and exciting
People are far nicer here and noticeably less prejudiced and narrow-minded
You could almost say it’s like a completely different country, in that the rest of the country sucks and London doesn’t.
This seems to be a common theme amongst the replies
Capital cities seem to often alienate the rest of the country
Lol that’s so telling
Mums bought me a lotto ticket every year since I turned 16 for Christmas cos her mum used to do it for her and her sisters but I think that’s more of a family tradition than a national one

Funny you should ask - just the other day Boris was talking about relocating the House of Lords to York, but I don't think anyone took him seriously
There has been a move in the last few years to move some government departments outside London, though, particularly the bits run by the civil service rather than politicians, while the BBC, which is a public institution, if not strictly governmental, has been doing a lot more production at "regional" sites in the last few years
*Doctor Who* was made by BBC Wales in Cardiff from 2005, and there's a big new media city in Salford
Don't forget the new proposal to move the Lords to either York or Birmingham is getting some serious clout
Also you now have media centres in Salford (BBC) and Leeds (C4)
Not to mention the oil/energy capital of Texas
Anything by Shakespeare
For me, French is easier to understand than shakespearean english
If you tell me what a certain line is supposed to say then I can see why it says that but on reading it the first time, I have no clue what it means
And then you have to write essays about it analysing the language when you barely even understand what it says on a surface level never mind in more depth
Honestly Shakespeare is really hard for me to understand
I'm learning french and I understand french more than I understand Shakespearean english even though the latter is supposed to be my native language
That's kind of cool but I'm wondering how that would work in terms of exams and assessments
Also in terms of teaching
For example, the reason you have to read specific books in england is because you will have exams where they ask you an essay question about the book and you have to write about it
But even if you dont have exams, the teachers have to teach you about the book and how to analyse it and what it means etc
Obviously in the exam they cant think of a question about every english literature book in existence and in lessons they cant teach you about every book, the class has to all be reading the same book
In primary school we had to read books in our spare time and after you read a certain number of their "easy" books you could choose to read any book you like so maybe that's what you're referring to
I find anything because a chore when its forced
In primary school we had to read a certain amount of books but they forced you to read these shitty easy books made by this company before you could read proper books of your choosing
You had to fill in this book to show what books you've read and they had a chart on the wall of who reads the most
Thing is I was always an avid reader but was always at the back because I didnt want to read their shitty books about children who can wiggle their ears
I see but then what did you do in your literature lessons
How could they teach you if you weren't all reading the same book
Also I feel theres a bit of ambiguity about what literature is
For example, is Harry Potter english literature
Some would say yes, others would say no because theres a feeling that it has to be old to be classed as literature
Tbh in a way that makes more sense because I found with GCSE english literature exams that you basically end up just remembering the interpretation and analysis of specific quotes rather than thinking of it yourself
Our school had to choose one book from a list of books in various categories so we had to do a shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, a modern novel and one of a choice of two collections of poems
We did respectively: Macbeth, Jeckyll and hyde, animal farm and poems about power and conflict
We did have GCSE English language exams though where they gave you extracts from books you probably haven't read before (usually obscure books or short stories) and have to analyse it which I suppose makes you use the skills more
But yeah I guess your systems approach is more about learning the skills than about memorizing which I think is better
I did gcse english lit 2 years ago and had to remember loads of quotes from the texts and the analysis of each quote
It's super pointless because I cant really remember what I learnt now other than a few miscellaneous lines from Macbeth
The word "nonce" has come on leaps and bounds recently
It means paedophile, and for the most part it has been quite a taboo word
Lately it's become a lot more casual as an insult and can be used in a lot more situations, even jokey ones
"Milk in your tea first
nonce", "wearing a full kit to a football match
nonce". It doesn't even have to be related to being a paedophile anymore
I remember just a couple years ago my sister calling me a nonce jokingly and our whole family had to explain to her what that word meant and you can't just bandy it about like a common insult
Now she could
i fucking hate this word tbh, it's unjustly ubiquitous
it's a really harsh insult and yet it's been tossed around so liberally that it's losing meaning
do you understand what the indo-european language family is
I think the tone plays a big part
If you spit the word out with venom it can be a really cutting and nasty word
At the same time it can be really jokey with a more relaxed tone
Nonce
I thought all Bulgarians would be like my friends
I was wrong
They weren't bad, just not friendly and personable like my friends are
Maybe it's because they live in the UK though so they go out of their way to be nicer than they would with other Bulgarians

She was complaining about how awful the weather was, and I asked when she had visited us, which happened to be in the middle of February, the worst possible time of the year
Again, go to a town in rural Austria
There are places where the majority of people are wearing them
God bless you
If only more of our countrymen appreciated our food so
Surprised we haven't gone the way of Atlantis yet tbh
The cost of housing the UK (especially cities) is destroying disposable income for all young people
My parents were pretty normal middle class but we still went skiing in France/Italy/Austria most winters and would summer in Spain/Italy/Portugal with the occasional trips further away like to the US or something
But now I cant see people who have similar jobs to them being able to do such things
There is noway my parents would ever have been able to afford the house or the life we had when I was a kid if we did it all now
If we did have disposable income like we did back in the 90s investments like stocks etc isnt really that part of our culture
Obviously people do invest but your normal middle class family is more likely to spend disposable income on holidays than on investment portfolios
I am glad my childhood is full of amazing memories traveling around Europe and other parts of the world rather than my dad giving me some numbers on a piece of paper when I turn 18 or whatever
I have a pretty decent disposable income but honestly I spend it on luxury goods or I save it for maybe one day buying a house
Wealth inequality is a gaping void in the UK, there's a very real North/South divide aswell as a centuries old entrenched class system
I’m pretty certain I’ve read before that we have the largest wealth inequalities in Europe, which really does not come as a surprise
Yeah, it makes us lazy
One of my biggest regrets is being monolingual
I'm trying to make sure my kids don't make the same mistake
If you’re only talking about the north Germanic languages, there’s something unique about Danish
Including all languages spoken in Nordic countries, Finnish and Greenlandic are both special, each in very unique ways
Finnish for me
I really like Finnish
I have a mild obsession with Finland
Such a unique country
They all sound the best
Its impossible to choose

This especially annoys me with Verb endings, which are pronounced similarly but can change the meaning of a sentence substantially
Sure they are a lot of differences but, as a second language learner, they can be very hard to pick up when listening
Latvia: It'll be fine I guess, we were already merged for centuries and we get along well with each other well so it wouldn't be too bad
I would imagine it'd be like a Belgium situation with 2 different highly autonomous regions and languages

I wouldn't particularly say so, no
Once I was on a particularly jerky bus, and a guy was eating some kind of watery Chinese   broth out of one of those plastic rectangular trays
It was sloshing about everywhere
A few actually
Mötorhead, Deep Purple, Def Leppard, Rainbow, honestly there's too many good English bands to name
Edit: AC/DC's Australian not British
There’s an interesting story behind the name
Back when England invaded Wales and had a lot of soldiers stationed there, when a local woman had a child with a soldier, the kid was a “John’s child” as the welsh people nicknamed the soldiers John due to it being a very common English name
In the welsh accent, it sounds like Jones, and that became their surname
In the UK, I feel it’s pretty much split between north and south
Northerners will say “hi” and “thanks” to the bus driver, have a little chat to the supermarket cashier etc
In London, people very much go about their day and keep chit chat to a minimum
It's definitely "Cheers Drive
" when getting off the bus in these parts
It's pretty universal general friendliness wherever I've been across the UK
General talk about the weather
Unless you're talking to the taxi driver, in which case it has to be something really deep and philosophical especially for a drunk at 3am
There's an older chap that passes pushing his bike along past our house, groceries in the basket, usually as I'm leaving for work
Always get a proper chat with him
I don't know him, who he is, his name, where he lives, but we always have a chat
You get the full “good morning” out
I’m Northern, so i’m not sure whether this is a regional thing or a wider English/British thing, but I almost exclusively say/hear “mornin’”. Seems a bit of a mouthful to get one extra syllable in for absolutely no reason
Saying "I could murder a Chinese/Indian right now" doesn't mean you want to commit a hate crime, it just means you'd really like to eat some Chinese or Indian food
Well it doesn't entirely rule out them being a crackhead, that might have been why it was such good craic
Very
Definitely a beard renaissance going on
It'll be a lot less in the future because fashions trends always change
I would say maybe 50% of men have some kind of facial hair in the UK
In fairness I haven’t been out in public a lot recently for obvious reasons, but beards definitely started gaining popularly in the last decade or so
And in my personal opinion, long may that trend continue
Love bearded men
So gorge
Yeah I do think it's more of a renaissance though, had mine about 10 years and still now when I mention maybe getting rid my mates and partner react in horror
Maybe I'm hideous without one, although my partner of 5 years has never seen me without said beard
I can definitely relate to the weak moustache
Probably another summer of 'football is coming home' just to bottle it in the quarters or semis on penalties
I think England will scrape through to the Semi's without playing a good team
The whole country (me included) will be sure that we're going to win it this time
Then we'll play France or Belgium and lose by 3 or 4 goals
It depends who we play in the Knockout Stage, but probably Last 16, maybe Quarter Final, again it depends on how the knockout stage works out
If you make it out the group stage and we don't I'm deleting twitter
Hah, the age old English problem
We need to win every match against Scotland
They only need to win one
It would be a new national holiday,  lol
It's a pretty crazy group
3/4 of the top teams I'd expect to make semi's without groups stages in the same group
I think you will though
If your players turn up on the day you have the best team by far
I love Irish
A lot of people don’t know that Ireland has its own language but if you look it up you’ll find it
I’m not sure why it just sounds so cool to me
I don't think anyone considers William Beresford a hero
Trying to think of a British national hero who wouldn't be thought of as a villain in another country
Boudicca maybe
...you think she was considered a "hero" in England
Cromwell is not liked in England though
Cromwell is the only thing that British monarchists and Irish republicans can agree on
He can burn in hell for all I care
> Michiel de Ruyter
Literally who
Don't forget that he (rightly, in my opinion) also wanted the Allies to declare war on the Soviet Union at the end of the Second World War
There are many of us who hate Cromwell
It is pretty much the only thing us British monarchists and Irish republicans can agree on, though for slightly different reasons
What he did in Ireland was unforgivable, mind
Meh, it's not so much him as his sons
Sir David Attenborough
He's a nobody
I mean it didn't seem to stop us very much in the long run so yeah not really
A language is a dialect with an army
scared for lgbtq+ poles right now

>Why it’s okay to call white people white, and using “black” is offensive
Where is this a thing, I've never heard of it, is this a language thing
From an outside perspective, most Brits would definitely say that the Baltics are part of Eastern Europe
For example, many people claim that the UK is Northern Europe, however most people would say it's Western Europe
You're too "attached" (mainly geographically) to Eastern Europe to be considered NE from my personal perspective
Never mind the ethnic/linguistic/cultural/historical differences
"Scotland, and the UK"
Scotland is the uk
Yeah IMO Northern Europe is very much the Scandi countries
It isn't an uneducated guess, I agree with the guy you're responding to
Most people agree that the Baltics are EE
>Most people also don't differentiate between someone from NI, Scotland, Wales, or England and just call everything together "England" and everyone "English"
Nobody does that except for Americans, from my understanding
They are all different countries so struggling to differentiate between them, as a European, would be fairly ignorant IMO
It would be like me saying Spain and Portugal are the same because they're Iberian
The only difference is that they aren't in a union
Yep
There are actually arguments out there that would classify English as a Northern European language due to the early influences from the Jutes/Angles and the later influence from the Norse
Even still it is classified as West Germanic because these are fringe arguments that tend to nitpick at small details rather than look at the bigger picture or common perceptions
In the same vein, some will say that the UK is part of northern Europe due to certain historical/linguistic factors but I don't see it
We are Western European, in my opinion, due to our lack of isolation from the rest of Europe/the world and our geopolitical and cultural influence
It's still up for debate whether or not we're even NE geographically or not
The connection is far too weak
Yes besides "Baltics can into Nordic" meme culture I'm sure nobody knows anything about the Baltic's political or cultural climate
I understand their close link to the scandies but rightly or wrongly I feel that the majority of Europeans just don't see such a strong link between the two
>Ask around how many languages in Europe use "England" as shorthand for the UK in colloquial speech
I will be sure to ask my Eastern European partner that tomorrow morning, although I already know what the answer will be
&#x200B;
> And in general, calling former USSR colonies "Eastern Europe" is the same as calling the "countries" (regions really) of the UK England
It would be done only by ignorant people, since it makes LESS sense than calling Scotland England
After all, England STILL rules those three "countries" in a large proportion, while Russia has indirect influence at best on "Eastern Europe".
England does not "rule" the rest of the countries in the UK at all
Just look at the former and the current Socttish referendum movement
Yes there are a lot of political shenanigans that aren't ethical or right, but England does not "rule" or "control" the other countries in the Union
I didn't say that the Baltics were Eastern European due to former USSR rule, that didn't even come into consideration
Russia's previous control had/has no bearing on the general consensus IMO
I disagree completely
The Normans had a great impact but it can't overshadow the impact of \~600 years of Anglo-Saxon rule
Our language is still Germanic and I don't want to delve too deep into our ethnic background, but considering the fact that I live in Yorkshire, I would say that "native" English people could have such a distinction too
The Norman impact was primarily political and linguistic, and while they brought a great deal of influence to our country, throwing away 600 years of history is a bit short-sited IMO
Weird how people will always remember William the Conqueror, a French invader, over Alfred the Great, who was arguably the savior of England, and the man who subdued the Vikings
I think it speaks volumes of the failures of our school systems to teach us history
Who cares about the foundation of this country when you can learn that Henry the fat cunt exploded in his coffin
Dude, as much as I appreciate the effort, we simply will not agree
Despite former USSR rule I would still consider the Baltics as part of Eastern Europe
I wasn't even alive during the USSR but I still see it that way
This isn't some remnant of the past, though, I'm pretty sure it's common opinion
Also my gf is from a latin langauge speaking country so, if I've been listening to her right (dear God I hope I have), then they have distinct words/phrases for the UK and its constituent countries
As for your other points, democratically the other British/NI countries are not ruled by England
Yes, England could roll tanks into Scotland in the event of an independence vote, or simply fuck them politically
Of course many of us (including myself) don't agree with this, but in a union someone has to be the strongest member
That doesn't mean that, on paper, the strongest member rules the rest
It simply means that they have the capacity to rule the rest
I hope to the Universe that in the event of another referendum it doesn't boil down to violence
Yep, always
The only time I might wear shoes inside is if I'm about to go out and have already put my shoes on and then realise I forgot something in another room
I've never known anyone not to do this
Disregarding cleanliness, surely it would be too clunky to have shoes on inside
In fact, outside of winter, I only put socks on when I need to put my shoes on, and usually I take them off soon after I take my shoes off
So I'm barefoot most of the time indoors
I never take off my shoes unless I’m getting in bed
Wait, really
You'd say being barefoot inside is gross
I honestly would never have considered that an issue
At what point *do* you take your shoes off if you wear them indoors
I mean, surely you can't wear them in bed, so do you take them off right before, in your bedroom then
Do you take them off just before you get in the bath
What about cuddling up on the settee
Or just generally lazing around
And what, do you put them on first thing in the morning when you get out of bed
I'm genuinely not sure how it works haha
It just seems so bizarre
Fair enough I guess
I was just surprised that that was an issue for some people
I mean, I kind of get where you're coming from, but it's only feet haha
I only meant it was bizarre in that it's completely alien to me (i.e. wearing shoes indoors)
And the questions were just because I genuinely didn't know what people did and where exactly they drew the line
To me, actually wearing shoes in bed isn't all that much more bizarre than wearing them in the bedroom
It's not necessarily obvious
It's all relative
Why are you so hung up about this
> You must have been in plenty of houses in England, where shoes are worn
Nope
Next to none
I've found out from this thread that this isn't universal, but it's not something I have experience with myself
That's why it just feels a little bizarre
It's unfamiliar; that's all
To me, you take your shoes off and put them on by the door
It seems bizarre to me to do this say in the bedroom or something
It's like an outdoor winter coat; it would just feel *odd* to go around wearing it inside
It goes against what I've grown up considering basic normal universal habits: you wear shoes outside not inside
It's challenging something I thought was normal and *that's how the world is* that makes it feel bizarre
Nothing wrong with it
Just feels strange to me
Make sense
As a kid, my mum would cook these sometimes
We had a large garden which meant lots of leaves/branch cuttings to dispose of, so there were often bonfires
I just want to say thank you to Turkey for exporting döner kebab to the UK
It's wildly popular here as a late night food, but I too do not trust the chicken version
That said, *nobody* really knows what goes into the lamb version
Probably orphans and stray dogs
In a similar vein, theres a [Cafe Vergnano] around the corner from my office in a Tudor building
And around the corner from that is [This Pret] on Fleet Street
That place is like a posh hotel lobby
Its no longer vodaphone and now a shoe shop (I think its Loake) who have a similar sign - Im guessing theres some rules about signs at that part of the city
Yeah Fleet Street is full of buildings and statues like that but they're hard to notice as its such a congested place
Yeah I’ve been inside it before
I am very anxious but more so for my vulnerable family members than myself
Completed the survey anyway
Good luck with your studies
Hello mate
Done the survey, I’m nit massively worried for myself
More worried for my elderly family, especially those with underlying health issues
So my response says I’m very worried about the virus but not I’m not worried about myself
You’re almost definitely a smarter man than me but thought I’d let you know that I think (in my limited knowledge) you could have included a question or two on how worried people are for their family
I really

It's not too common nowadays I don't think, but it's not considered completely abnormal
People are generally aware that some people do eat rabbit and that rabbit meat is considered food
It's not like eating a dog or something
That said, many people wouldn't want to eat rabbit themselves due to being primarily familiar with them as pets

Sweden & Denmark
Spain & Portugal

i'd say jamie vardy works though

I skipped this when I saw what language it's in, but then I read the last line and it became instantly intelligible
Great write up
where I live, in the smaller towns and villages, piemontese is still spoken fairly widely although of course less with younger generations
But there are some bigger towns such as Dronero which are kinda famous for the fact that everyone, even kids speak it to a greater extent
omg it's so damn hard outside of the UK to get a decent Indian/Pakistani meal

We seem to be meeting Croatia a lot lately
We stand a chance against them, and should beat Czechia
The other team is not decided yet but it looks like a decent group for us
We should get tested by Croatia but should still go through, which is probably the ideal scenario
Oh goody
Croatia again
could be a lot worse, just annoyed we got fucking Croatia again we just can't seem to escape them
I really really hope Scotland get through the playoffs so we can play them in Wembley

My Dad and his generation are increasingly getting their way, and my country is losing its soul to racism and xenophobia
Scotland may very well leave, dunno what will happen to Ireland
soon it will just be England and Wales
So sad
Really not that bothered, we would he better off if NI and Scotland left the UK anyway
The only downside I see to Scotland leaving is we're likely to be dominated by Tories for the foreseeable future
I don't see any downside to NI leaving or Wales for that matter
I'm much, much more worried about us leaving the EU
Don't care
Reality is very little would change in my life
Scotland would be a separate country but guarantee there would be a similar situation to Ireland with free movement and no border
And Scottish will keep the pound too
but I don't think it's guaranteed to happen by any means And people saying Wales will leave are taking the piss
No, and I'm not worried about it happening
Northern Ireland is certain to be part of the UK in the medium term due to the Unionist community outnumbering the Republican community, and the Unionist Community being largely pro Brexit
Scotland can't leave the UK unless the Government changed, as the Conservatives have said they would not allow another referendum in Scotland, and polls indicate a big lead for Johnson in an election ATM
A lot of Europeans don't realise the Scottish parliament cannot call an independence referendum, it needs a majority vote in the UK parliament to happen
Wales wouldn't leave because they are very economically dependant on England, and Wales voted leave, so having a country the size of Wales independent but not in the EU while being so closely tied to England isn't really viable
We're already dominated by Tories
The liberal influence of Scotland barely ever changes the results of political votes and decisions
Something my n. irish BF has always told me about
And it's true
Very sad
I find it strange how Europeans ejaculate over the thought of breaking the UK up
What is the likelihood of a perpetual Tory government with Scotland still part if the UK compared to a UK without Scotland
There is a difference, regardless of the recent SNP surge
>but a lot of people have a strong sense of national pride about the whole of the UK
English people, you mean
I'm just saying that Scotland feels forgotten and unrepresented *because they are*. Aside from their devolved government, barely any of their political decisions affect national policy
Obviously there is a difference, but it's really not that much at all
Scotland was very much part of the Rule Britannia era
Check out the Scottish exploits in Guyana for example
Scottish aren't the victims but the perpetrators in that era
The bigger issue is that Scotland can't just leave
They need a vote in the UK parliament, not the Scottish parliament, to get a referendum, and the Conservative policy right now is to refuse any request for another referendum on Scottish independence, and although there will probably be an election soon, Boris has a big lead in the polls now
we have a tory government right now because of scotland, if that's not their political decisions affecting national policy i'm not sure what is
The way English national pride is based so heavily in the past
Yes, we used to be the most powerful country in the world and now we're not
I just wish that instead of moping about Britains decline, more people would think about how we can become a great country in a modern, progressive, positive way
Scientific advancement
Fixing the environment
Just generally making UK, and the world a better place to live
Why does greatness have to be tied to our imperialist past and all its negative connotations
>most people I know don’t

The wife gets annoyed when I tell her to hurry up

Yeah, I find that annoying, and I feel like it makes it harder for people to move on from the old imperial style of English pride
London is 40% (or less now) white British
Foreign born people make a significant % of the population
London isn't a good place to experience British or English culture
I identify as both
I chose the English flair though, because I think it's more helpful for non- UK people to see that my comments come from a specifically English persons perspective
Unfortunately, it's been utilised too much by far right nationalist groups
It doesn't have a far right origin though, so I don't see why we can't just reclaim it
I would never ask for no onion
London and Westminster are still technically two different cities to this day, in terms of local government at least
It's all sausage to me
That the Union Jack doesn’t include the welsh flag because when it was created Wales was seen as a part of England so only N.Ireland, Scotland and England’s flags were included
Wales=Cymru in welsh (probably already known)
The vikings continuously attacked the welsh coast lines in the 10th century and took a lot of welsh into slavery
The Romans struggled to beat the welsh and make them compliant
There were around 13 campaigns between AD48 and 79 and the Romans weren't used to the Welsh guerrilla fighters of the mountains
Seems alright lots of people I know have been on holiday there
It's fucking ours
If I may shamelessly plug a mate's book, *[The Hunter] by Andrew Reid, available on Kindle and dead-tree edition
Probably not just for my country but I love goodnight mr Tom
It’s about a young boy who was one of many children sent of to new homes during world war 2 and it made me cry
Because it's bad for the EU
That's why Scottish independence = weakens UK position, strengthens EU position = good
Whereas Catalan independence = weakens EU integrity = bad
Sock puppets also supported Scottish Independence
No one here seems to have a problem with that
Any subversive movement is supported by our enemies sock puppets
That doesn't delegitamise the movement

There's no indication the other 25% were any different in preference to the rest of the country

So stupid
I often say "seldom". What's wrong with it
It's a handy, short, word that gets shit out of the way
People tend to use stuff like "rarely" or "almost never". Check the amount of syllables to say that:
Sel
dom - 2
ly - 3
most
ver - 4
If you seldom use seldom, you should consider using it more often
I'd say, "it's pissing it down", "it's chucking it down" or, "it's really coming down

1991 I started learning this verdammte language
I've lived in Austria, I have a bloody *degree* in it
And this is the first I've heard that it's supposed to be dankeschön not danke schön
So'n schoas
I was taught they were separate words at school
Not sure about this one
Some people do say for sure
That's awfully specific
Funny that the English singular "you" is a remainder of a time in which there used to be a formal pronoun in English
The real singular, second person pronoun in English is "thou". "You" is certainly plural
Which is interesting to note, since many languages use third person or plural as a form of formal addressing device
Check Portuguese: "você" which is formal in Portugal (but not in Brazil anymore), it uses third person verb form and derives from a contraction of "vossa mercê", which means "your (plural) [benefit/desire/will]".
Italian has its share of weirdness too, considering that "lei" and "lui" are objective cases of "ella" and "egli". "Lei" is also third person and used for second person formal addressing
You can actually translate it to English as "thee".
Add to that madness the remainder of genders in English and the fact that "it" represents a neutral gender (therefore not masculine nor feminine, so it could be used with unknown gender), and not an object or animal
Now because of political correctness people are using "they" instead of "it" to address people of unknown gender, we will end up with plurals as becoming singulars
It's madness

The funny/sad thing is that a bunch of “luxury flats” near me suddenly got new cladding just after Grenfell too (so at least builders cut corners across class boundaries, right

(I’m willing to bet there will be no meaningful consequences for anyone, though

Although, as with many things, it’s a situation that could use a little nuance - after all, the issue with Grenfell (as I understand it) was a) that it is a very, very tall building, and b) that the cladding was applied to a pre-existing concrete tower block, creating a rare set of factors that made this fire so ferocious and so dangerous
On a three or four storey building where the cladding covers hollow walls stuffed with insulation and etc
(such as with many new-builds), I can imagine the dangers posed actually being far lower
Maybe I’m wrong, and obviously having a building made of anything flammable seems daft (although I guess most interiors are anyway), but you see what I mean
That all sounds very sensible
Particularly about the independent body (which anticipated my first objection to the “needs more regulation” thing, since - presumably, given that Celotex lied - the current regulation already legislates against using flammable materials as cladding
That's some nice carpentry work
It's like the Renaissance all over again

This is what I like to see in museum tbh
Sure, it's great to have a big section on local history, but I like it when they have sections on other regions and cultures too
I can't afford to travel the world (or even Europe) to see all the historic artefacts, so the only way I'd get to see them is if they're in a local museum
It would be nice if museums around the world could share their collections and rotate them around so more people get the chance to see them
I got really excited when the Egyptian museum put the Tutenkahmun collection on tour- unfortunately coronavirus shut everything down the week I'd booked to see it in London :(
A German giving Brits shit for their history
The cheek
Fuckwit
Are you saying that Britain can't "make greatness"? Half the inventions of the modern world are from British inventors
Loads of influential art, films and music
Wow so when you buy things; what your really doing is stealing them, got it
No you cant, 8 million artifacts in the British Museum, no way are more than 50% non british
Give back my tapestry first you French bastard
Yea
sorry about that :/
The British museum is exactly that, artefacts from around the world and all it ever gets for that is criticism
>Today Egypt is a country that has a pretty good record of looking after artefacts
Even today this is not true
Only a few years ago they did permanent damage to a Mummy due to incompetent academic staff
Also have you seen where they keep their artifacts
Dirty fucking warehouses where shit is just piled up and unlabelled
It's a "great fire" waiting to destroy it
Britain is doing the world a service by looking after the Egyptian objects it has
Because (1) It has the skills and tech to get more useful research than Egypt will ever have (2) It stores it's artifacts in a way that means they'll still be here in 2100, whereas Egypt's warehouse will probably have burned down by then
Yeh it's not like Greece would ever allow it's most prestigious and important historical symbols be destroyed
On a seperate note, why did the Parthenon get blown up
Germany BTFO
I am going to name that more iconic duo and it is Great Britain and Portugal

Can you imagine being the emergency services operator and getting the call that Notre Dame is on fire, must have thought it was a joke
Just tragic
A beautiful art work of architecture
Absolutely heartbreaking
I studied history, love ancient and mediaeval sites
Notre dame is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen
This is horrible
Truly heartbreaking
I admire your optimism but what made Notre-Dame so special was the amazing wooden interior, its not like cathedrals that are all stone work like the Frauenkirche
The stuff that truely makes is a wondrous building is literally on fire
Yeah I immediately thought of the York Minster fire after this news, especially with  the front face being similarish in style to Notre Dame
That old stone is surprisingly resilient and I'm sure the bulk of it will survive despite the spire collapsing
What the FUCK
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

The Space Race was perhaps the best part of the Cold War
Yeah, it was fuelled by rather fierce rivalry, and sometimes resulted in panic (especially with the launch of Sputnik 1)
However, it is probably the only part of the Cold War that resulted in the betterment of mankind
If it weren’t for each side trying to one up each other, it would have likely taken years longer for the first man to go to space, the first man to walk on the moon, and for us to reach where we are today, exploring Mars with rovers
It’s truly exciting stuff, and we have men like Yuri Gagarin to thank for helping pave the way for mankind’s exploration beyond our planet
Is spared the right word
I mean, it's not like it was a hostage from the fire
Survived might be a better word

I'm genuinely scared of what Brexit will do here, because if the experts were right, my quality of living will decrease
But if it doesn't, I'll have to live with a lifetime of *I told you so's*. That being said, if they change the NHS in any way, I can't see itself staying in this country for the foreseeable future
Is Ireland on that branch with us then with their 5% loss of GDP, more than ours
The worst part about Brexit for me, is being suspect to tons of piss taking by everyone else in the world for something boomers are doing that no one else wants
Honestly even though I don’t the UK being made fun of, I can see why people would
This situation is pretty wack
Edit: people seem to be mad at the my comment where I mentioned that “no one else wants” brexit
I’ll admit I over exaggerated
Oh god
this is so fucking true it hurts me deep inside
Fuck our politicians
I'm sorry Europe
Belive me when I say even parliament dosent understand brexit
Can we just fucking leave the EU already we’ve had about 6942000000000000000000000 votes on it and it’s ended in leave so just fuckin leave bruh
Misses the bit where the guy ask the cat to give it billions before he leaves
44% of Northern Ireland voted to leave
I don't really blame those people though
They're all miss informed and been sold lies by our politicians
Politician's have constantly left parts of our country behind and unheard
Using the EU as a scapegoat
Politician's allow the referendum in the first place, not for the country but to protect a party (the tories in this case)
Politician's decided to make the referendum legally binding when they could have just used is an advisory
So yes
people that voted for Brexit made the wrong choice (IMO), but I can't blame the vast majority of them
I still work with people who voted leave and believe it will be good for the country
That the no-deal needed to be on the table and the EU will balk
That we will land all these amazing trade deals
That all the economic downturn is because of our in-ability to leave, not a default due to leaving
One guy is like "well there is no precedent to this
so anything could happen
I'd rather take the risk, even if it's only once, doesn't workout and we have to rejoin".  I mean it's a fair point, it would work in smaller scenario's but applied to a whole country
that sort of risk taking is dangerous and if it doesn't work, it's not just a single failure point
Millions are affected, industries collapse
etc etc
IMO those risk's aren't worth taking
Whatever, it was 44% of the people who live under your flag
Just 9 percentage points less than the English
Plenty of Brexiters in your region of the UK
>To be fair, I’m kind of with them
Correct
They're Northern Irish, just like you
And like i've said, 44% of you voted for Brexit, and are dragging remainers out of the EU
But you blame the English, cause you're a fool
>  I’m not Northern Irish, I’m Irish
You had a northern Ireland flag when we began this conversation ... You know I saw that, right
Jog on, idiot
I'm not interested in anything else you have to say
It's more the customer saw fish on the menu and chose it, but has spent the whole evening having the staff of the restaurant tell them they should have chosen chicken without making any steps towards actually making the fish
The restaurant owners were so convinced everyone would choose chicken since that's what all there marketing had been in favour of that they never thought to actually stock up on fish
It would be more akin to the waiting staff not wanting to serve you fish, spitting in your food, and undercooking it and bringing it out in front of you and saying "see, fish is bad, have the meat" and expecting you to accept that fish is by default bad, and the fact they have actively attempted to sabotage your meal means you shouldn't want fish ever again
No thanks
Get back in the kitchen and make us some fucking fish
As the one other person on the table who wanted to order chicken has their head in their hands in anguish
Alternatively: you order the fish
They say that they have fish and will serve it, but then obfuscate and delay and make getting the fish impossible
If you were to then capitulate and order chicken, that was clearly what you wanted the entire time
They knew best
Leaving the EU isn't magical unfortunately for EuroZealots
It very much exists and is written into law infact
Splitting the leave vote in 2
No on is falling for your tricks
It's a good job the Remain Campaign spent 6 months prior to the Ref telling us we'd face economic Armageddon then wasn't it
Then surly the next referendum should be how to leave
Considering we already voted to leave the EU
No deal vs May deal
Every household was sent a leaflet explaining why Brexit is bad already
We get it
Yet we voted to leave anyway

Remainers 2 years ago when we voted to leave: REEEEEEEEE FUCK THIS WE NEED A SECOND VOTE BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO LEAVE IS RACIST AND WE DIDN'T GET OUR WAY FUCK HOW THE VOTES TURNED OUT FUCK THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS GIVE US WHAT WE WANT NOW
Remainers now: We must respect the peoples wishes
ItS nOt DeMoCrAtIc OtHeRwIsE
What a load of hypocritical shite
The irony is not lost on us
I don’t think a single person, leave or remain is happy with how the negotiations have been handled and I know most people want her gone
Stop trying to paint it like everyone just agrees with may
But you know what, at least I can vote against her in the next election because she actually has to answer to us eventually
We know we can change our mind
We can have another referendum and vote to remain
Because neither ran single-issue campaigns and the only party who ran an anti-Brexit campaign was the Lib Dems, and they were just coming off alienating almost every single one of their supporters through continually betraying their promises the second they got some power
No campaigns, manifestos or even the Leave campaign itself ever promoted, supported or accepted the mere possibility of a no-deal Brexit either
We'll see
That’s the thing, it was a stupid vote
Like, say if you were asked to vote on “Would you like to live or die
” and everyone votes ‘live’ (because most would) and then you find out that the live option involves an eternal existence of absolute agony and loneliness and to die is revealed to mean passing away an old person surrounded by loved ones
See the problem there in holding people to vaguely defined absolute terms
Not another Chernobyl

She obliged to follow the will of the British electorate
The European Union could learn a thing or two about respecting the result of referendums
>What changed
Dunno, might have been that big referendum
I'm glad these campaigners are becoming more honest about who their audience are
Clue: it's not the people of Sunderland or Birmingham
Yeah she’s a remainer
I don’t understand the confusion
Politicians are employed to speak and act on behalf of the country and constituents not their own opinions
I mean everyone knows she was a remainer but she's prime minister so she has to deliver Brexit
I wonder if the '#ledbydonkeys campaigners know how public opinion would feel about them posting billboards insulting the nation's leader in a foreign country
I'm honestly gobsmacked they thought this was a good idea
They'll be lucky if this goes under the radar
12200 Europeans looked at this and saw absolutely no way in which Theresa May could be a remainer AND still a Prime Minister
And you all would be crying if a Brexiteer was handed the reigns so this billboard and post is bullshit
One of the main reasons Brits voted for Brexit was because of the EU's Freedom Of Movement policy
To elaborate: The problem with FOM is that its a veeeeery, almost exclusively a one way thing(ie East>West, 1 million Poles in the uk since 2004 for purely monetary/economic reasons etc
The vast majority of Brits have no need or want to move to Poland/Eastern Europe in return
Why would they
, Or 60% of the entire Somali population of The Netherlands moving hede once they got their EU passports(Merkel's migrants would do exactly the same too)
That same personal economic/monetary benefit is not there for Brits
Its not helped by the fact everybody speaks English as a 2nd language, what language should Brits speak when they already speak the language of the world
FOM works if its between equally economically developed, cultrally similiar nations but FOM doesnt work if its between vastly unequally economically developed, cultrally very different nations etc
And its been a disaster here in England/UK
If the EU were smart they'd of recognised from the start that the UK has special circumstances regarding FOM, and that the UK should've been treated different and allowed to have exceptions/its own tailored FOM agreement
One size does not fit all like the EU seems to think
Hence we have Brexit
Also the problem with the EU for many Brits is that time and again, repeatedly over the years the EU has shown that its not interested in and has no intention of ever reforming itself
It has ignored the UK's wishes, ignored & even decieved the UK many times on many issues when it comes to reforms & certain EU policies that negatively effect the UK etc
So its clear that all the EU care about and the reason they're begging us to stay is cuz they desperately need and want our money
That's it
The EU have only just now realised that the 2nd biggest contributor to EU funds is going and they now have a huge hole in their budget and no other country is wealthy enough to pay for it or not willing or even in a position to pick up the slack etc
And with all due respect to the EU its too little to late
Some billboards aren't really that expensive
You realise Northern Ireland are very happy as they are right
They don't want reunification
Why are people so happy to simply ignore democratic will nowadays
I wasn't referring to the referendum in the United Kingdom
The intention of the poster is clear #ledbydonkeys , and it's location serves to make leavers think "I am so glad I didn't vote in line with the people who would do that".
That’s us
Well I think you are great bunch of lads Ireland, even if you do think I am a prick
Joking a side, never met an Irishman who had genuine hatred towards me as an Englishman, it's mostly been directed at our government and I totally agree with them there
Woop de doo
wierd how despite the Scottish being the ones who caused the Northern Ireland problem
England gets the blame for it
And the scottish love it, they just duck their heads and keep quiet, in the words of shaggy "it wasnt me". despite more scottish high ranking officers than English in the empire, despite their solo failed attempts at colonialism
it all gets dropped on England
even the Ulster-Scots problem
which has 'Scots' in the name
is Englands fault
Being from the north of England imma label myself as “great bunch of pricks”

A lot of brexiteers have a deep hatred for the EU
They cheer every problem that the EU faces, and are absolutely convinced that brexit is the first step on the road to the dissolution of the EU
There was lots of chat on ukpol about how the EU was a doomed project and how brexit would be the beginning of a complete unravelling
Because your comment was so classy to start with
That's by Ben Garrison, a Montanan (US) pro-Trump libertarian cartoonist

I was travelling with my mother today and saw a bus puff out some thick black smoke
It got me thinking about electric transport and subsequently electric trains
I think, if all of Europe worked together, we could make great strides towards developing not just a cleaner mode of mass transport, but a cheaper mode of mass transport between countries
It's a win-win and cheaper in the long term
Rights aren't things like "cheap train travel". Rights are inalienable that cannot be taken away, without force or authority being enacted over you, which is is usually authoritarian
A good example is the right to eat
You have a right to eat (the physical act of eating) , but not a right to something to eat, because that would require someone elses labour to create the food to provide it to you
A simple test of rights is to imagine yourself on a deserted island
How many of your "rights" do you still carry with you
If the right is no longer implementable without mandatory labour, it wasn't a right, it was your government trying to guarantee services to its citizens
I'm all for cheaper train travel, but when you declare something a right that isn't inalienable, you water down what a right is, and make it impossible to guarantee when things go south
I’m sure if you did this for the UK it would all be red
At least all of Europe can agree on something

On that note, funnily enough, Vietnam actually does kinda see the US as a beacon of safety
Everyone thinks the Vietnam War was this big deal and that they must hate America forever, but for the Vietnamese, that's just a tiny blip in their 1000+ years of history with their bigger neighbour: China
The Vietnamese and China had their own war with each other as soon as the USA left, and that's just one war out of many that they've had throughout the millenia
Nowadays, Vietnam is one of the most pro-USA countries on earth
>Today, the Vietnamese view the U.S. in a positive light
About three-quarters of Vietnamese (76%) expressed a favorable opinion of the U.S. in a 2014 Pew Research Center survey
More highly educated people (89%) gave the U.S. especially high marks
Young people ages 18-29 were particularly affirmative (89%), but the U.S. is seen positively even by those who are old enough to have lived through the Vietnam War
Among those ages 50 and older, more than six-in-ten rated the U.S. favorably
They're entirely different countries and have dealt with things differently
God bless American Capitilism
>73% of Americans now agree there should be no such laws
That still means 1/6th of your country either believes that being homosexual should be illegal or that they *don't know if homosexuals deserve legal rights*

They are
They're still European so yeah so there'll be similarities but that doesn't mean they have exactly the same opinions on everything
I've been to most Nordic / Scandinavian countries bar Finland and they're all about as similar as any other countries in Europe that are close
I generally just work with the rule that Left and Right is relative and depends on the local culture
Not to mention that in some places, what is considered progressive might be considered conservative elsewhere
Shit show started
Besides some airy fairy abstract idea of cooperation being good, multiculturalism has delivered a Europe of extremes
Just because Hitler = bad, it doesn't mean Europe hasn't fallen into the trap of complacency postwar
Ask the older residents of Calais, Malmö, Rotherham, or in the banlieus of Paris or Tower Hamlets what they think of the doctrines of state endorsed immigration and the ghetto friendly doctrine of multicultural
Or is every white person over the age of 50 in the places just a confirmed racist

Even nowadays, when people don't speak out against their bosses because they fear a bad reference or they signed an no-disclosure agreement, it shouldn't be hard to understand those who went along with a military dictatorship in which they served and which was known to kill dissenters without any pretence at justice
They're a different category than the eager Nazis

Yeah, it seems the show writers forgot that the Angles literally came from what is now modern Denmark lol

This is a win not only for the US, but democracy for the entire planet
It’s a win for us in Europe, finally a sane President in most of the continents greatest ally outside of it

But I'm sure you're fine with Biden doing it to the UK
The video is fake though
So I’m guessing the whole of Europe has been experiencing some kinda storm lately
In the UK we’ve had torrential rain, heavy thunder for the first time in a very long time, and strong winds on and off for the past two weeks
Yet at the same time, it’s been real warm in between

it really doesn't though, especially not the senate or how voting works
>Imagine a Tory PM having to work with a Labour Parliament
well it sounds silly from our perspective in the UK but it's just a different system with different rules, ours is Parliamentary, theirs is Presidential
“Americans should only consider the opinions of people whose country has been under relative geopolitical stability in the last 30 - 100 years”
Yikes
People really need to separate governments from people in statements like the one above you tbh
But why should their vote count for less than someone else's? Everyone's vote should be worth the same amount
With the current system it means that people from States like New York and California aren't worth as much in terms of voting compared so some other states
Surely if one candidate has 60 million votes and the other has 50 million then the one with 60 million votes should be the president
With the current system it makes a lot of peoples votes redundant and results in situations where someone can have a lot more votes yet still lose which doesn't make a lot of sense to me
They also killed 2 members of golden dawn in a drive by too
Then they wonder why their own get's killed by them

Everyone's talking about the problems Scotland would face in this hypothetical situation whilst ignoring that you've just handed over Northern Ireland
They'd be plunged straight into civil war
Please don't
that England and Wales flag is awful
So Scotland having a hard border with it's biggest trading partner, 71% of all its trade goes there, even more goes through there, wont be an issue now
And the new Celtic Union of Ireland & Scotland should then pass Quebec style language laws to kick out/ban/supress English and the Anglos, and bring in Quebec style laws to favour, protect and bring Gaelic back as the new national language & culture of this new Celtic Union
I’m pretty sure a lot of people in N.Ireland would not be happy about this
England man bad
As if, the whole Celtic myth was blown out of the window long ago
Most Scots are divided between Lowland Scots who are basically Englishmen who migrated up North, and Highland Scots who are Northern Irishmen who migrated East
The Scottish,English and Welsh are more closely related to each other than the Irish although the Irish are like distant cousins
A more defined North-South divide
I'm in
Nooo please don’t leave us Scotland
Can you take the North of England too

Celtic Union Of Broke
I like their flag though, hate ours, needs less Welsh
Good one, as if we would let wales be on the flag lol
r/me_ira
Hate to be pedantic, but it wouldn’t be called the United Kingdom of England and Wales
In terms of the union, England and Wales are a single entity
The United Kingdom refers to the island of Great Britain after being united by the union of England and Wales, and Scotland
No Scotland means no union so no United Kingdom
Irish + Scottish ... not sure we want the DUP on a grand scale
Ah yes, the
Celtic
Union of
Northern Ireland
The Republic of Ireland and
Scotland
Surely this is satire, nobody is mad enough to mix them two
Scotland is about as divided as Ireland between catholics and Protestants, except the Scots aren’t blowing each other up
It will only cause more trouble
I feel lile Northern Ireland would hate that
Do it
Yes
Great Britain is a landmass comprising England, Scotland and Wales
Ireland is an island comprising the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland
The United Kingdom is the soverign state of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
they can take the Isle of Wight with them, full of inbreds
People salty about brexit and can’t stop crying about it
I was about to just about to link /r/shitanericanssay before i saw your flair
Why are you bitter towards the English
And not the welsh, or more than 1 in 3 Scots who voted leave
> I like this idea on a personal level, but that's because of my current bitterness towards the English
Cant fault your honesty
So does England, not as much as Scotland
Remember that oil in the last few years bottomed out from $91 per barrel to $32 per barrel, and could do again at any time, also remember every year oil becomes closer to extinction as we move into other technologies
I'm not sure how Scotland can survive on one industry, that could be dead soon and can't be trusted for price variation
That's what the SNP did in 2014, all it's future predictions were at 2014 oil barrel prices, they then collapsed by 2/3 over night
Thats even more reason then
It's the last refuge where there aren't any, you mainlanders are a right bunch of interfamily lovers
> after Brexit I'm now one hundred in favor of Scottish independence
Too bad that the Scots are still only 45% in favour, and the SNP got annihilated in the post-Brexit election
England, England with knights, jousting, basically a real life game of thrones adaptation England
England with hundreds of different dialects and accents all with their own history (Norse, Saxon, Jutish)
England with all the castles and wars, kings and queens, literal fortresses in cities England
Can’t be, no culture, basically just USA wannabes
It wouldn't be called the "United Kingdom of" since there's no union
> Because it's mostly the English who are currently fucking it up
When I think Brexit I think Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage
Posh English pricks
And yet it was mainly the poor who voted for Brexit, not the rich
> I almost exclusively consume British media
Including for example James O'Brian's radio show
I'm a brexiteer, I like James O'Brian in general though, but he only ever seems to get the thickest twats on there to debate brexit with him
Like absolute idiots, if you don't know what you are talking about, why go on there
He always catches them out with questions like 'what EU laws don't you like
'...and they never have an answer
i could list fucking dozens
But no, he will get some thick cunt on instead
The other issue being of course is that Brexit is harmful, and you don't have a financial leg to stand on
But these rich people like James, who went to private school and is privileged, dont understand that it's not all about money to some of us
There is a reason that the have-nots voted for it in droves, and no it's not racism or xenophobia, it's because it wasn't working for them, so why keep it
"I hate the English so I consume English media to reinforce my hatred of those English cunts
Right
> Why blame that on the EU instead of your own incompetent politicians
Unless you believe the lies, you should know that your own government has a lot more effect on how your country functions than the EU
There are many things to blame our government for, but that does't mean the EU are not also to blame with some things

We've been headed straight to destruction for the last two years
More and more people realising what's happening and changing their minds on it
May's deal is being shat on not because we think she can get better, but because the majority of the country now wants to stay in the EU
The country is under no delusion that we have *any* leverage over the EU, or that they owe us anything
Oh, is it back to being a trading bloc again
Isn't it funny that when we want to enter or leave, it's a trading bloc, and any other time, it's a political union and we're stupid for not realising it
We're not Americans

"Liberal" can mean "Liberal markets with little regulation" as well as "Liberal attitudes to abortion, pot and same-sex marriage". Some Conservative parties, like in the UK, support this, whilst at the same time opposing socially liberal values
In other words, let corporations do what they like, but don't let gay folk marry

Question: why does a US president need to go to an EU summit
Did someone forget Biden’s booster seat
Does this count as an official state visit
We already know Biden comes with a shopping list for the EU - and a lot of what it is in it - a shopping list that the EU is going to laugh in his face over
This aint exactly going to end well
President President Biden now
Von der Leyen going to that seems strange, but I can understand Merkel going
But even then, VdL has some kind of power in Germany because Germany is an EU country, but Biden has no power there
It seems like sucking up to America tbh, and seems strange to me
Of course it’s necessary to have meetings with him, but I would have assumed that an EU summit should be about internal matters, so should only be attended by EU officials and EU heads of state
That seems logical to me
Agreed, but it seems a strange way to show it
I thought an EU summit would be internal matters, meaning no outside heads of state
I totally get the reason but it seems a strange time to do it

They are to be honest, the vast majority are pretty good people
The minority are however the ones that make the news
Most churches are heavily invested into the local charity scene, almost every homeless shelter in my city is based out of churches and they provide things like soup kitchens, charity drives etc heavily
I've known a few priests and vicars and they've all been really kind people and completely accepting people
The minority abuse this power yes, there are certainly problems with the churches in some places
America has a bigger problem with for profit churches and so on but in my experience in the UK churches, mosques, temples etc and religion in general are absolutely a net good for the population
I don't believe in God, but his servants are certainly on the whole good

Quite frankly with this world cup victory
France are the best team ever at Russia 2018, They're the most brutal and vicious, and most ruthless champion there's ever been
There's no one that can stop them
Croatia is a conqueror
No, France is Alexander, Croatia they're no Alexander
France is the best ever at this world cup
There's never been anybody as ruthless as the French
They're Sonny Liston, They're Jack Dempsey
There's no one like France 2018
They're from their cloth
There's no one that can match them
Their style is impetuous, they're attack unstoppable, their defense is impregnable
And the French they are just ferocious
, They wanted Croatia's heart
They wanted to eat Croatia's children
Praise be to Deschamps
Anyhow for real congrats France
Its scary how young they are, they have to be favourites for Euro 2020 and Qatar 2022(when most of these players will be in their prime)
France are in a great position to dominate world football for a long time yet
At the start ot the match, the French team shouldve came outta the tunnel wearing berets, exactly like in the same way the French rugby team Racing 92 did for the Champions Cup final earlier this year
I cant help but think England wouldve provided France a much tougher game and England wouldve been a much more dangerous opponent for the French imo
Also people keep saying Croatia were the better team
But were they really
I dont think so
I mean lets be honest here
At this level Croatia have been utterly unworthy of a world cup final and, given their dismal, truly shite showings against Denmark, Russia and in the first half of the match against England(a match which England shouldve had won by halftime
But Croatia were only kept in it by some awful reffeering and getting away with countless fouls on England, very dirty), were bloody lucky to be there at all
Croatia are and indeed were very beatable, they are not that good
As France demonstrated today
Also Croatia's nasty Anglophobia really put me off them
I could never support them after how they acted after beating England in the semis
They turnt away many ppl who otherwise might have supported them
Haha :D I was trying to work out the French :D Took a while to realise it's Irish :D

Unlucky Ireland, your turn to deal with the frogs now

>Don't lead the UK into destroying the Good Friday Agreement
Hello there mate
Can you explain exactly how the UK would be destroying the Good Friday Agreement by leaving the EU
Or do what they did in Warrington and place two bombs at either end of a street, detonate one first, send people running in the direction of the second and detonate that one and kill two children in the process
I was against this when I first heard this but if there are multiple high level members of the party actually sanctioning murders, theft and assassinations then that's not a party anymore, that's a criminal gang
If they were going to commit crimes, they should have done what the Nazis did which is create a paramilitary wing that the main party can deny responsibility for while keeping the political party legally clean
Greek fascist party being labeled a criminal organisation
I mean you're Greek, so you'd know more about Golden Dawn than I do, but that's why whenever you want to install a fascist government, you usually want to separate your political party (with a clean image, and moderate politicians) from your paramilitary group (who can intimidate opponents and do a lot of ground work)
You have to ensure the politicians constantly denounce the work of the paramilitary group even when it works in your favor
but even with the SturmAbteilung (who were the paramilitary group for the Nazis), they had to eventually purge them as well in the Night of the Long Knives and absorbed them under Heydrich and Himmler in the SS
Our negotiators failed so now our trained gull squadrons are reclaiming the UK's fish one at a time
I bet French air traffic controllers are livid right now knowing no one would care if they went on strike
So for anyone interested there is a guy called Gary Raikes who began a political party called the New British Union which is a revival of Sir Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists
It's an interesting read because the party is very openly fascist and has strong links to the British Nationalist Party and Britain First, both of which are very far right
I was quite surprised that they actually have a website too and are very open about their fascist views and it's an interesting read (I'm not advocating for them, I just find it interesting)
This is how the English deal with Fascists

Ahhh another ‘sort by controversial’ kind of thread
Well I’m sorry I don’t see Stalin, a mass murdering genocidal dictator, as representing all communist thought in the 21st century
Clearly a regime that made it criminal to be a homosexual and banned workers demonstrating is actually representative of a movement for equal rights for all and the emancipation of workers
Some smaller shops in the UK get twitchy when you hand them a £20 note, I can’t imagine what would happen if you handed them a 500
well I can and it’d look a lot like a stroke
I lost £10s and £20s before, pulling them out of my pocket accidentally, dropping them etc and you are always furious
imagine losing a €500

The EU doesnt have the bottle to kick the UK out, not in a million years
You're right but the US, UK and Australia (basically the anglosphere) have fully drank the neoliberal koolaid
I'd happily see a return to social democracy in the UK
Well it's based off the asset owning class (middle class) and the non asset owning class (working class)
That's how it's defined in the UK anyway
Or to use left wing terms the bourgeoisie and the proletariat

Grrrrr

You're European tho

U.K. should be higher

Kinda depressing at no point did anyone think the UK helped at all
I won't lie, it irks me how much credit the US gets, comparatively to the UK, what with FDR's laissez faire attitude to fascism in Europe until 1942
It is highly likely the allies would have lost without the US but to come in so late and reap the 'glory' is something of a sore point for most historically minded Brits
It's interesting because there's really no right answer
Who did they ask
Americans
They do realise that Britain was the only reason D-Day was possible
The battle of Britain maintained our inependence, our Navy secured the Channel, our spies organised the resistance, our landing craft got men on the beaches, and our meteorologist gave the window that caught out the Nazis
Britain almost did *more* for D-day than the US

>French government, who at its very core are secular, projects cartoons onto building of Muhammad
>Islamic extremists attack Church in response, an organisation that is totally separate from the French government by law for nearly 300 years, had nothing to do with the cartoons, and is by nature completely non-secular
Just shows how senseless these attacks are, if they were really revenge specifically against Macron, government officials would be targeted, not a (presumably) Christian civilian
Seems worrying like it’s a revenge against France as a people, not just a state
Sadly the UK and Germany aren't far behind France in this matter
UK government so chickenshit to do anything from fear of muslim backlash and civil uproar
Instead they continue to let this bubble up behind the scenes

Are you able to remove the wholesome rewards

Just because the extremists and the islamists haven't been triggered to show their faces in the UK doesn't mean they don't exist
Now just under 10% of UK schools are Islamic religious schools and will continue to grow, there's entire mosques and communities that are slowly getting worse and worse and preaching islamist text
At least in France they have cracked down on these mosques
UK government and the intelligence agencies are quite literally chickenshit to do anything about it
Not to mention more children are interested in islamic extremism than ever before, I wonder where they get this idea from

Look at all the majority islamic countries and then look at western Europe
They are polar opposites, in both freedom of speech, secularism, democracy (basically all western values), but you think it's a good idea to take in thousands of these people from this culture, let them live in secluded communities, in secluded islamic schools
Are you seriously telling me this is a good idea
Or are you brainwashed
Who
You'd think, or hope, the police officer would have more knowledge of strategic positioning than some 10 year olds
Shaquiri looks shorter than his billed height of 5'7
I know most professional sports lie about these things, often claiming players are 2, 3 to 4 inches taller than they actually are
Tbh I get the impression Shaquiri probably doesnt even like and doesnt eat Swiss food/cheese
He's Albanian/Kosovan so i doubt Swiss cuisine is one he enjoys, and it seems generally from reading his various comments over the years and his actions etc that he doesnt feel very Swiss and doesnt identify with Swiss culture either etc
I think Switzerland is merely a means to end for him, its not where his heart truly is, its more so a career choice than one he truly feels passionate about
Just using Switzerland basically
There was 100 of the worlds best AIDS researchers on that flight, including Trevor Stratton, a Canadian who was getting close to a vaccine
I wonder what the real casualty cost is

The initial reports were wrong, here's what is true - (other truths are available, I bear no personal responsibility for your understanding of the truth and facts are subject to change at any time)
There was a blow to AIDS research on the flight, Joep Lange (RIP) for instance lead the work to prevent babies getting AIDS from their mothers

Looks like Switzerland and Norway was conveniently left off
How did the mother become older than the children when the children created the mother
This is shit
So the EU is treating all the member states as little children who can't make their own decisions

You can call a woman handsome in English, but it sounds old-fashioned and some people who are uptight about gender roles will be insulted
Some women would take it as more of a compliment than being called pretty though
Calling a man beautiful is rarer, but when I've seen it done, they usually imply 'inner beauty'.
Beautiful is more universal than pretty because it is often applied to intangible things like music
Handsome and pretty are more associated with what people look like, so I've seen men described as pretty more often than I've seen them described as beautiful

If bees and butterflies went extinct most likely we would use forced repopulation or replace them with robot pollinators
Still sad though, it’s funny how the very fruits and veg they stock in Tesco is a big reason why the pollinators are dying off, agricultural farming and the chemical runoff
Are you sure Mr Beast didn’t buy it
There's tescos in Slovakia
TIL
If those bugs were to actually die off it could possibly cause a knock-on extinction event meaning governments and international organisations would definitely get involved in methods of saving or replacing pollinators
Fuck me that's a steep curve

I'm happy paying £100 for a ticket a few times
I already pay £45 for parking fines where I am because it's cheaper than actual parking it lol as much sense as that makes
So you want to be late to places to try be cool speeding excessively
Yeah then go nuts
Oh yea wow that's intense
I never go over 10% of the limit, but I almost always speed
Based on that, I wouldn't even qualify for the lowest tier
If you're doing 50kph over the limit in the UK your looking at a driving ban not a fine
Lolol 50k speeding ticket

All he had to do was say 'it's been nearly a year and I haven't seen my girlfriend and I miss her' and you'd have some sympathy, this is just stupid lmao
Yeah that's more damning, I'm gonna imagine he isn't the type to be fully isolating and getting everything delivered
If he was then I'd probably forgive him but yeah
not good
Honestly if that is the case then I don't think he's that bad if literally all he did was go to see his girlfriend and nobody else was involved as long as she did the same
It's the people who go to house parties every week that are fucking us over and stopping people like him who don't go into public from seeing loved ones
It's pretty shite for our mental health and seeing a girlfriend once every few months is gonna help keep that in check
Yeah that's why I said as long as she did the same
The only person I've been seeing is my girlfriend, granted she lives in the same country and not far away enough that I'd risk seeing other people but I get his predicament, it must suck
But Christ he could have just said 'I miss her' instead of making shit up lol
I agree but given his lifestyle I don't think it's *too* bad
Yeah you're right with that one, makes no sense at all
Don't worry about it my friend, shitty times makes for shitty mental state

The forward-facing guns of HMS Belfast on the River Thames are positioned to score a direct hit on a motorway service station at Scratchwood
If the six-inch guns, which can fire eight rounds per minute, were loaded with 112lb shells, they could obliterate the motorway cafe and toilet stop in seconds
I'm consistently amazed at the thousand year history of almost constant warfare between our disparate nations
And yet we're still neighbours, peace has reigned for an unprecedented amount of time now between our proud, fractious states
A lot of our cultures may be lost on outsiders, but this history is \*ancient\*. How proud I am of how far we've come, how grateful I am that I don't have to be conscripted into dying in some desperate field in the France every other generation
How can we throw this away, fellow brits
Forgive my sentimentalism
My friends often call me alarmist, but the right wing insurgence across Europe and most infamously in my own country, not only gives me a great deal of concern - but almost depression
How can we waste this opportunity
Lasting peace in a continent that for millennia that has only known war
The mere mention of fractious sentiment should be given the elevation it deserves - it is backwards
It is a throwback of what once was
How thankful I am that much our previous mutual hatred and rivarly has turned into essentially a meme - something we can sincerely poke fun at
Its not a bad thing, humour is the ultimate healer
I now feel like I have more in-common with the various Europeans I've been lucky to become close friends with than many of my own countrymen
How often has that ever been a possibility
I care not much for the political institutions of the EU, but for its foundational ideals and the people that populate it
This is the first chance of many, many generations to founder European brotherhood
It's so fragile right now
Perhaps since it's first inception it was only a fools hope
I can only hope that we will see no major conflict within Europe within my lifetime
This is one explanation from londonis
com:
"But why this target in particular
It has nothing to do with the exorbitant price of its cappuccinos
The imperilled service station sits neatly on the radius of the guns' comfortable range (about 18
5 km at 45º elevation, but the artillery could stretch to 23 km if pushed)
A point anywhere within that band might have been chosen for the resting formation of the six forward guns
According to the ship's Chief Yeoman, Kevin Price, Scratchwood was picked on because it was a well-known landmark on the M1 motorway
"We could also hit Cheshunt, or Gidea Park, or fall just shy of Dartford," he tells us
Scratchwood, though, has a certain quotidian monotony that invites comparison with Betjeman's "come friendly bombs" prejudice
The targeting was decided as long ago as 1971
This was the year HMS Belfast was first moored in the Pool of London to serve as a museum ship, following decades of distinguished service as one of the Royal Navy's most powerful light cruisers
It goes without saying that the Belfast would never have cause to bombard the motorway — but the guns had to point somewhere, and targeting a famously humdrum location could only help with press and popular attention
HMS Belfast is operated by Imperial War Museum and is open daily to the public
I seriously doubt Putin is worried about his seat

For every pain there is equal and opposite elation so I hope every Croatian is going as nuts as I would have been
We did better than we thought at the start and are a world away from two years ago
England has won every tournament in the younger categories and has a young senior team so we have at least some hope for the future but we will never have a better chance to win it again and neither will Croatia

It has a sense of grandeur and neatness which looks pretty great, but to me the grids are also a symbol of autocracy and imposed order
To rebuild a city means to order everyone living in it to give up their property and build over it
After the Great Fire of London the King wanted to implement a similar plan for the City
However, one big thing stopped him: the rights of the people
Families owned the land, the shops and houses, and they began rebuilding after the fire based on the old medieval road layout
The King in England didn't have the power nor the money to force enough people to give up their land and build a grid on top as in Catholic Europe, so London kept its curves and bends and side streets
It means it's arguably a more ugly city compared to these beautifully laid out grids, but it's historical and interesting to see

Apart from the otjer comment, basically its a tall bridge built over the tyne thats been here for 90 years
From spring to late summer theres a massive nest of kittiwakes that look cool and natural and stuff but then you see the path under the bridge which has an ungodly level of birdshit on it
Honestly the tyne bridge is not one of the nicest parts of town, theres a big long road called dean street which leads to underneath the bridge which is famous for its georgian architecture n stuff, which is much nicer
....and more castles in the area than any other part of England
Also the place where the lifeboat, windscreen wipers and lucozade was invented
Also the end point of Hadrians Wall
Newcastle is a great city
To be fair there are nice bits
Dean street's georgian architecture is apparently famous (even if the shops you encounter go from a posh steakhouse and a big theater to a shite KFC ripoff and a brewdog)
There’s some great ones not too far from me, personal favourites are Barton in the Beans and Stretton en le Field

Well yes
It's what I expected .
There are around 200 countries in the world, nearly all of them are not in the EU, the UK will be fine
Worth it
In the theoretical world where Ireland unites and Scotland remains, it would likely still be called the United Kingdom of Great Britain
In fact, even if Scotland left it would probably be the United Kingdom of England and Wales
Not going to happen,

Ello Guvna would be a southern saying, well, London actually

...we've done as many trade deals with non eu countries in 2 years as the EU has in
I see us more as a switzerland, or maybe Iceland
you're over it get lost
And how about France, Italy, Spain
the other large EU countries
Yes
rolled them over, added a few bits to a few deals, such as Japan
and dont pay into the EU
so better deals
I was told by this subreddit deals wouldn't be rolled over, other nations would cut the weak Brits apart and we would become chicken feed
We are too weak alone
Etc etc etc
....we've got the same deals, without paying into the EU
Win
If we hadn't negotiated anything, we wouldn't still have the same deals would we
Near the top it is labelled, but what about iceland
Lol yea I realised that, now I feel silly, was about to stealth edit my comment as well
You cant dish out and not take it
You realised we just let ourselves out of the €750 billion EU covid recovery fund right
How much did that save us
....and now we dont pay into the EU and have the same deal
WIN
No, I'm opening up the fact that had we remained
we would have likely paid 20% of that €750 billion over the years
No, its like going to Tesco, paying for it, leaving
With the EU countries, its like going  to Tesco everyday, paying for it everyday, then leaving
Since EU countries still have to pay into the pot every day, the UK doesnt
Just like €760 billion EU covid recovery fund, we are not part of it
every EU countey now has to pay a share of that
because inside the EU you pay every year, there are no club card points
You pay a yearly membership to get the benefits of EU trade deals
The UK now gets those same trade deals
but doesn't have to pay a yearly membership
....but EU countries still pay into the EU every year to keep those deals
The UKndoesnt pay into the EU and still keeps those deals
So therefore the UK has a better deal
same as the EU without the cost
We've already signed some lermanant ones
like Japan
which is better than the EUs
We took the EU deal, added some favourable stuff for both of us
then signed it
Easy when you dont have 28 chefs on 1 side
So just going to completely ignore the fact the deal
went further on data, finance etc
...and is euronews now an unbiased source, is it
Borderlex
who's owner is Iana Dreyer
the anti Brexit woman who is always on TV here
sounds like a sound source
Not
Same deal
dont pay billions into the EU
Win
...no, the fact that's she's on TV here all the time moaning about brexit
is why she's anti brexit
Fullfact didnt come to the same conclusion did they
The EU pays yearly for the deal
The UK doesnt
Why
Nobody cares about flags here

He had to go, you can’t have a prime minister that campaigned and voted remain, in a country that voted to leave
He lost the referendum and his political career was done
The mistake they made was putting another person that campaigned and voted remain in his place
Nope
That was all we were even going to get from a deal given the red lines we presented
Nope the leave campaigners never left
Both Boris, Gove and Leadsom (the three most prominent conservative front-bench leave campaigners) put their names foward in the conservative elections after Cameron resigned
It was between Boris, Leadsom and May as the final three with Boris and May equal on MP's. Gove then backstabbed boris and took half of his MP's to try and clinch the leader spot
It failed massively, and the final two were Leadsom and May
All the remain MP's voted for May and Leadsom lost support due to the Gove betrayal and the news that she was against Gay Marriage and Abortion
So I think it's fair to say they didn't disappear
Boris was FS in May's cabinet for a while, Leadsom, Gove and Javid all hold positions along with other leave campaigners
It's not that they've gone away, it's the fact that they haven't been able to get into power
Well Leadsom withdrew because she had only 66 MP’s on her side compared to over 130 May had
Gove backstabbed Boris and so ended Boris’s chance of ever gaining enough seats
A lot of Gove MP’s voted for May rather than Leadsom but if it were Boris in the final two and he didn’t get backstabbed he could have possibly taken Leadsom’s, Gove’s and possibly some May MP’s who didn’t like Leadsom’s views
Boris wanted PM, he got backstabbed by a power hungry Gove
Yeah I said the mistake they made was putting another Remain campaigner as PM
I read an interesting article that talked about Cameron’s logic for holding it
The main reason was to stop the leakage of voters and MP’s to UKIP
It was the belief at the time that the referendum would kill UKIP as a party, which would prevent what has happened in European politics where the right wing populist eurosceptic parties have become the opposition
This would kill the Conservative party like it has done in France, Netherlands, Poland and Germany
It was also because of the fact he is a gambler, he has gambled with referenda before by allowing a Scottish vote of independence, which would also have devastating consequences for the UK
He gambled twice, nearly lost the first time for what was expected and lost the second
Both times he thought he would win easily
He also never expected life long friend Michael Gove to backstab and campaign for leave
Also Boris betrayed Cameron and campaigned for leave even though he tried to whip his party into supporting the governments Remain position
He has never spoken to Gove and Boris since and both MP’s have shown their true colours
Just power hungry narcissists
Yes I completely agree but the 2008 global recession was the cause for it
The UK is very reliant on its financial sector, which is the most badly hit by the financial crash
Austerity hasn't helped but its definetly the recession that has triggered the riots and the subsequent fall in the living standards, stagnation of wages and lack of economic growth
Recessions have been heavily linked in the past 200 years to political instability, scapegoating, rioting, more extremist views and a lack of faith in the political system
Austerity has caused a further strain in public services which wasn't needed after a recession in my opinion
It was partly for that too, but the EU didn’t get him a major deal or reform that the country was asking for
The main reform we wanted was optional freedom of movement between member countries, the EU didn’t delve into that idea at all
Also we tried to advocate for a slashing of EU red tape and a rearrangement of CAP and CFP
He wanted a serious discussion for a reformed EU that focuses on sovereignty and the EU budget discussion would have more thought in Britain (its second biggest contributor)
He also wanted an updated EU budget and policy that doesn’t recognise that the euro is the single currency in the union but that the Sterling and other smaller currencies should also be considered in the budget planning
All that Cameron got back was he was allowed to put a brake on benefits for migrants and a lot of vague promises
EU reform deal: What Cameron wanted and what he got
Well everyone knows in the commons that Gove and Boris hate each other and haven’t spoken since
We made it
Happy New Year :)

Was this the massacre in response to the assassination of that bastard Heydrich
Or a different one
[Adolf Hitler in 1942 talking in his normal, everyday voice to Finnish military commander Mannerheim
talking about the invasion, setbacks, mistakes & problems regarding the invasion of the Soviet Union and basically somewhat admitting tha the tide of the war is changing against Germany and that they're screwed, Germany cant win and also revealing his(Hitler's) thought processes, what he was thinking at the time
Iirc after the holocaust werent most returning Slavic Jews/Eastern European Jews still attacked, rounded up and killed, and or banned from getting their now stolen homes and business back etc by the various non-jewish slav populace and the governments of these Eastern European countries
The violent, rampant anti-semitism wasnt just a Nazi thing
It was always there before and after the Nazi occupations/holocaust
No there’s speculation that Himler was involved because of a conversation someone overheard when Heydrich was in hospital but it’s all speculation

Never heard of the Fridays, north east
We do NOT have mayonnaise with fish and chips in Sussex
I believe this is all the evidence we need to emancipate the north from the south
Clearly there is a split and differences too great to get over
Wasn’t there a website that can basically pin point what region of the UK you’re from based on what words you use
I can’t remember the name of it but it guessed me by my use of the word daps for plimsole shoes and also that I call wood lice ‘billy bakers’.
If you call it a “batch” or a “barm cake” you should be imprisoned
What dirty bastard has Mayo with fish and chips
I live in the grey area and ive never heard of the other Friday names in my life
My mum was from the north when she was young
She does not have an accent anymore but she pronounces ‘oo’ words as ‘u’
That data is hilariously wrong for Northamptonshire
It is not a county that is South
I love how half of these are just north vs south with extra steps
MAYONNAISE
That's possibly the most dull thing you could cover your chips in
You forgot “Technically has an Independence Day” vs “no Independence Day”
If in Norfolk you see someone eating mushy peas with fish and chips they're getting a slap
This is surprisingly accurate
I’m in West Yorkshire and every one is correct for me except bottom left - I have curry sauce with fish and chips instead of mushy peas, although mushy peas are nice
Live in Somerset, top 3 are wrong, happy to see one i agree with - I do like Chips with mayonnaise :)
I’m from that small pink area that calls a small loa of bread a batch
It was completely new to me when I joined the army and realised not everyone called it a sausage batch
I was looked at a few times in a very puzzling way but more often that not they received a just as puzzled look back
Hey newcastle should be gravy with chips
(Except i prefer curry anyway lol)
Disgusting people putting mayonnaise on chips filthy fuckers
This comment 2was made by the Chips peas and gravy gang
Mayonnaise must be Tartar sauce, right
I've lived in the north for half my life and the south for half my life and while I do alternate how I say some words I will NEVER pronounce it grARSs instead of grass
Supper is what you have after the main evening meal, at least that's what my nan always calls it
Haha yeah, also chiggy pigs for Devon
From the south and no one has mayonnaise I know of but every one has curry sauce
It’s delicious
We even get it when ordering Chinese takeaway
...and no mention of tartar sauce
Your outrage made me laugh and I can confirm I occasionally do but not often
It helps that's also where most the jobs are
It's for the best we save the north for a surprise when you visit
it's the best thing to go with chips, other than salt and vinegar :)
They must mean Tartar sauce, surely
Don't forget to brush your teethe
It's not like the liquid from an actual curry like a tikka masala, it's more of a lightly spiced gravy

I have mayo :(
I'm in Devon and I have mayo on my chips, and either ketchup or mayo on fish & chips
Gotta get down on Friday
haven't had tartar sauce in years
I'd forgotten about that
Thanks for the reminder
Definitely good with fish and chips :)

Freight services used to go through England but are now being rerouted due to Brexit
Brexit had very little to do with race and a lot more to do with a general sense of a country just wanting to be in control of what laws she made
(FWIW, I’m English and voted Remain - anything for a quiet life - but it’s basically slander to say Brexit was predicated on racism
((Also, UK is more multi-racial than most other EU countries anyway, so who would it be racist against
White people
Protests aren’t mob rule, are they
They’re part of democracy
I mean, we’re two Remainers (possibly of varying levels of commitment) second-guessing what was in the hearts of (what was it
) 37% of the voting public in 2016
I think we can probably agree that this Herculean task is likely to be beyond us
For the good of my sanity, I choose to believe that it wasn’t necessarily about *who* came - different or indistinguishable - so much as just the sheer volumes, which (taken with all other immigration) did increase our population by ten million from 1997 to now
(Compared to a 2 million rise between 1974 and 1997
)  That is ***A Lot***.   And we weren’t prepared
And I think some communities suffered for it
I can see why those communities might want to stem it however they could
And I do think as well that there’s something rather commendable about people wanting their democracy to be local and direct (rather than feeling incredibly remote and absolutely beyond their control and largely unaccountable as it’s hard to deny that it does with decisions taken in Brussels - I mean, amongst other things, Brexit is a vote for the efficacy of the Poll Tax Riots, no

The whole thing has been a mess
First people vote for Brexit without understanding what it meant besides leaving the EU, then they fire off Article 50 without actually having a plan, and then they keep requesting extensions because they somehow haven't planned anything and decided they want to deal with it after we've already left
Businesses are closing down, larger businesses are taking their business elsewhere, unemployment is on the rise, the cost of living is increasing sharply without salaries across the country matching those requirements, housing is being bought by dodgy Chinese and Russian businessmen so homelessness is on the rise too
All this for what, so our kid's kids can have a good future
What about me
I'm 25 and now I'll never be able to retire whilst overworking in my future just to eat
Fuck the future generations, they should have been looking out for current generations
It wasn't their job to look out for them
To be completely fair though, the the £203 billion expected cost of Brexit is also not a black hole
The lack of investment into the infrastructure and people of the country will continue to produce worse returns, poorer lives and bleaker economies for many generations
**sigh**
It was not about the money but also (mostly) not about xenophobia either

Rees-Mogg made £10mil just in one day - the day his mate announced the pro-rog of the UK parliament
Guy Verhofstadt has stated that a European empire is the only way to defend Britain’s “way of life” in the 21st century
Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, the euro-federalist said: “The world of tomorrow is a world of empires, in which we Europeans and you British can only defend your interests, your way of life by doing it together in a European framework and a European Union
The EU is a federalist monster held together by a network of dodgy Eurocrats, they’d happily slice up the UK, Scotland, Norn Iron and all her liberty
They make their intentions very clear
No we won’t be assimilated into an empire regardless, the UK is the 5th most powerful economy on earth, not everyone is so willing t’ kneel to foreign empires, no matter how beneficial to our economy they may be
The right to self-determination is hard and easy to take for granted
That one MEP just so happens to be the EUs top Brexit Negotiator, id say he’s very representative of the EUs ambitions
No, the UK will still be 5th after Brexit, we will definitely suffer economically for a short while but not even close to as severe as you’re predicting
You really don’t think the United Kingdom couldn’t possibly survive without being consumed by one empire or another
And even so, you’d so easily surrender your self-determination
The fact that he’s the top Brexit Negotiator actually does matter a lot and does reflect the views of other EU leaders, as they put him in that position
Does the prime-minister not reflect the attitude of the government as a whole, simply because it’s one man
Brexit has never about the EU in it’s current state, it’s about it’s future one
It’s grip gets tighter each year, if it’s this hard to leave now, imagine 10 years down the line

More younger people not being educated
Not every German was a Nazi, but the mass killings were generally known (especially in the Wehrmacht) and tolerated, even if the "death camp" portion of the holocaust was only revealed at the end of the war
On the other hand, it's not just Germans who were guilty
The ordinary people of lots of countries (Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Romania stand out) massacred their local Jews before the German soldiers even arrived
But it seems everybody tries to push the blame entirely onto the Nazi leadership and the SS, forgetting that it takes much more cooperation than that to exterminate 11 million people
>And what use does it have that a Wehrmacht Soldier knew it
My Great-Grandfather was not at home for the entirety of the war
Full 6 years
When he was wounded he was sent for a year to do guard duty in France, to then being sent back to the eastern front
He was completely unable to send any letters from 43 on
They just stopped to arrive
And even before his letters were censored and full of generic phrases
His wife was getting the information that he is alive in 46
3 Years not a word
And even if he had found a way: i'm quite sure a soldier fighting for years is the wrong person to ask what is wrong or right
I doubt he saw in those people anything else then the enemy
My point is that you can't delineate into "Nazis committed the crimes" as if the "Nazis" are separate from the ordinary people or soldiers - thousands of regular members of the army committed innumerable crimes against civilians on the Eastern Front
Conversations secretly recorded between POWs make it clear that a hell of a lot of soldiers on that front, maybe even the majority, personally participated in them
Certainly if your great-grandfather spent most of the war in the East, he would have at least witnessed it in some form (especially in the scorched earth retreat)
How it was justified by the soldiers at the time, suppressing partisan activity or whatever, is irrelevant now
I don't think you can call that kind of historical honesty "playing the blame game". Actually this information was suppressed for far too long
Most people not just in Germany but other countries in the West have fooled themselves into thinking the common soldier did not take part in atrocities, it is simply incorrect
These people, along with thousands of members of the Nazi party, occupied prominent positions in German society after the war with no reckoning whatsoever
Look at the example of Kurt Waldheim, he approved propaganda leaflets encouraging citizens to kill Jews, and became the leader of the UN
Do you think his past actions would have been revealed if he was some simple business leader
Of course not
Because there were hundreds and thousands of men with similar stories who were allowed to continue their lives after the war
*Not enough* people were blamed, the vast majority of war criminals who survived returned home and built the Germany we see today
While I don't doubt the good intentions of German people today, it's also true that Germany was never truly denazified
>You talk about hundreds of thousands that should have been persecuted and hanged
I think the more then 2 million civilians that died while being forced out of their former homes should be enough to satisfy any kind of blood thirst
And if not: even more were beaten, raped and lost everything they had
Thankfully the US took another way then spinning this never-ending circle of revenge
I don't think people should have been hanged en masse
But I also don't think Germany was forced to reckon with the war until so many of the people who committed the crimes were already dead
The allies wanted to rebuild a strong Germany to counter the Soviets, so they needed the men and reduced their de-Nazification accordingly - that's a fact
It's really extraordinary that within five years of a war which, had it been won by Germany, would have resulted in the extermination of most of the people of Europe, the Allies were willing to forgive and move on
And even give huge loans to the perpetrators to rebuild their economy into a powerhouse
What I'm trying to say is that there's somewhere between "hanging" and "no punishment at all". And in this case, relative to the participation of the populace in a war of racial extermination, they got off pretty lightly
As for your other point, I apologise if I misinterpreted your argument, it sounded like you were upset at the way people were blaming "Germany" or "Germans" for the actions of the Nazis, I was just trying to point out that the distinction isn't really useful and isn't clear even now, partly because of the lack of de-Nazification I pointed out above
I was rebutting this specifically:
>But i also think generalization is growing and nobody really cares for details anymore
I have especially the feeling nobody cares anymore that not every German was is/a Nazi and that it may be a extreme insult to throw everyone into one pot with some of the most murderous people in history

Makes me so depressed to think how much we have eroded our trust on the continent with Brexit
Is this a trick to get the French to lower their defences so they don’t have to go through Belgium this time
Honestly I'm just happy we're not as bad as America or Russia
How do they feel about China
Do we have UK numbers pre and post Brexit
I live in Great Britain and honestly
I don't blame you
So they distrust the countries they couldnt defeat in WW2 compaired to the country they did
Germans sharing their opinion on who they think are trustworthy
That’s gotta be the irony peak of the week
Well the bottom three invaded their country
>I still rate the US higher then Russia, but not by much
No need to read any further
What a ridiculous statement
If that ridiculous view was more mainstream it's possible the US would leave Europe, and there would be a lot of lessons learned
Luckily for Europe most Europeans aren't stuck in a weird 19th century eurocentric mentality where they think that Europe can dominate the rest of the world, and are well aware that he who allies with America is he who wins
No one could ever dislike the EU if they were provided FACTS and CRITICAL THINKING LESSONS
You don’t think Germany spies on allied countries for information
Seriously
&!!!!! Every country does mate, we spy on America too
BRITSH POLL: 82% consider Germany an extremely close ally, 7% dont
74% think Germany does an amazing job at human rights, 10% don’t. Nice to see the Germans don’t trust us though
Germans aren’t known for their intelligence in Europe mate, can’t lose two world wars without having something wrong in your head
Someone posted the graph going back to 2013 and tbh it's not *that* much of a difference
It’s all just flip flop numbers anyway
This isn’t deep rooted trust and relationships like the one we have with our Anglosphere brothers
If Le Pen got elected and immediately took France out of the EU like she said she would, France would be looking at numbers similar to ours
You don’t ruin Europe three times in a row (Protestant reformation, WW1, WW2) and not have some sort of drilled in intrinsic power hungry complex deeply rooted into you
Lol
The Europeans have never trusted us mate, stop being so soppy, besides the smaller countries the bigger and more influential European countries have ALWAYS despised us, and it’s quite evident why, if leaving the EU is a precedent for “no longer trusting us” then it speaks volumes on what the EU actually is
Europeans didn’t care for us when we were in the EU and they don’t care now, we have much closer alliances around the world that we can capitalise on
How does America get that joke, you don’t holiday with us
When they invaded Poland
The most justified invasion in the history of invasions, perhaps ever
> The USA has high ideals about personal freedom and freedom in gerneral, a good humor and most of their people are chilled and just want to life a good life
Hello fellow GeRMaN
I completely agree
I’ve always considered Australia (obviously) NZ, Canada and France to be way closer allies to us than the USA
Sad my government tries to push a pathetically embarrassing relationship with the US where we dismiss some of our closest allies in an attempt to be seen as America’s lapdog
Thinking the US actually gives a damn about us, it’s all just sad

Sure man, keep telling yourself that
>treaties
Strictly speaking, no treaty even existed
The Senate rejected Obama's treaty, told him that it was non-binding and that a future successor could just undo it because it had no legal standing, and Obama still paraded it around as a victory and claiming it worked, only for the exact scenario the Senate warned him about to unfold
Yes the country that sacrificed their entire empirical GDP to stop slavery, the country that sacrificed their entire GDP to join two world wars to ensure the balance of power in Europe never swung, the country that sacrificed their entire GDP to ensure little countries will have their freedom and sovereignty against tyrannical European countries and we fought and died for that
If we really were a money grabbing country we would’ve just war profiteered, built up our navy, remained uninvadable and sold to both sides like America

Looks fine to me, Ireland can have Northern Ireland and Scotland, they’re drains in both senses of the word
this isn't insulting to me, living in the North of England
Poor effort with Britian and Ireland
Ireland should be called the british isles with  northern Ireland called "united ireland under british control" or some shit to piss off both sides
Scotland should be called "the english" and northern England should be called "the south" and southern england maybe "france". Wales should just be ignored
calling England great britian is not offensive its just the wrong border
Why would we

Uk has less road deaths than frace, germany, italy

No just facts
How about the fact we have less deaths than just about anywhere else in europe
That list shows Germany has more deaths per 100,000
not less
Per 100,000
Not total people
Desperate for a stat hey
What about the rest if europe who all have far worse mortality rates and drive on the right

Sony doesn't claim to own Bach's compositions, they DO own the copyright to some recordings of his compositions and YouTube's automated content ID system mistook someone else's very similar sounding audio as copyright infringment
The simple fact is, if you want to use Sony's recording of one of Bach's compositions you have to pay them for it because they own the copyright to their recording
Just as James Rhodes, pianist, owns the copyright to his own recording
Fuck Sony

no doubt in my mind the EU will fuck the internet up
That actually looks quite cosy to just sleep on the seats
Something tells me she wouldn't accept the result of another referendum if leave won again
She voted to leave first time around did she
My Fianceé thinks we should have a referendum on wether ti have another referendum as that will give a facsimile of the result of the second referendum but also mak room for those that want to uphold democracy even if they dont want to leave
She's not Scottish lmao
I couldn't put it better myself
I agree in that the original referendum should have needed a larger majority either way to be acted upon
But given that the terms were agreed beforehand I think the result needs to stand
The precident of ignoring the vote would be very damaging
I also don't buy the angle of "given all of this new knowledge" we need another referendum
As far as I can see there isn't anything major known now that wasn't constantly discussed during the 2016 campaigns - except how useless UK politicians are
So when Conservatives get a majority in the next election, you would accept that would you
Leaving the European Union isn't a unicorn
It's the factions within British politics who all want different things which have fustrated it - not necessarily the difficulty of the act of leaving
Agreed but I think the post is more aimed towards the protest than how attractive she is lol
In England this was the first winter we've had in ages that wasn't just autumn but somehow colder
Like we actually had snow in winter, not in spring, in Winter
The reason for remembrance is to honour the last wishes of people who often knew they were on a one way ticket - sometimes people who had barely lived past their sixteenth birthday, it’s the very least we can do to honour their sacrifice and I don’t think it matters how we do it
“Do whatever you want
We will sabotage/hurt you regardless do to our perception you have wronged us in some way”.
How does that work
Fire = oh no its even colder
Regarding Scandinavia, here's a surprising, fun fact: Did you know that the Brits/well mostly English specifically etc actually have waaaay more Viking genes and DNA within them than modern day Scandinavians do
Genetically at least the English are the real modern day Vikings
You'd never of guessed that, but its true
lol ok buddy
we'll see if you're still laughing when the scots are your problem
On one hand, I'd love Scottish Independence so they can finally fuck off
But on the other, if Scotland said no again it'd mean more miserable cringe cunts like you

What ironic about it
They can have independence and join the EU, we’ll start CANZUK without them :)
Close to becoming independent

Indeed, I just finished a book on Venice, and it's repeatedly brought up that part of what made the city hard to capture is that only the Venetians knew how to actually navigate the lagoon without grounding the ship in a sand barrier or mud
During sieges, they removed all flags and stakes that marked out the "routes" for ships to dock in the city
There are many squares, with rock paving essentially behind the houses, take st marks square as an example of a huge one
These all have wells (bricked up now), and those are the areas where there used to be small patches of farmland
The city was essentially built upon an island, but the whole island was always just a shallow area, with mud beneath the water
The wooden supports just keep sinking deeper into that mud
It started out as a destitute refugee village, and took centuries to grow into what is is today
Venice became rich because it's located right where a couple of rivers empty into the Adriatic sea
So all the trade goods coming from Northern Italy and southern Germany were brought to Venice, and the Venetians in turn specialised themselves in importing oriental goods from Constantinople, Crimea, and Egypt
There was a seasonal pattern to the trade; Germans and other Europeans would flock to the city in Winter to buy up all the Spices and Middle Eastern goods they had brought over
'City of Fortune' by Roger Crowely is an easy and fun read on Venice
He also wrote about the Portuguese, the Siege of Constantinople, and the Knights of Rhodes iirc
Holy shit, that's scary
People barely even reacted to it
Bonjour
Happy birthday
Italy is sponsored by PETA
So, I'm thinking celebrating killing two birds/meat/rabbits/hares is because more dead means more food
Celebrating killing two flies is because they are a nuisance - more dead means fewer bites and less disease passed around
What about the pigeons and doves
Food or nuisance
I like the French version best as it covers all options
No one, not a single soul:
Poland: meat
Wtf is Italy saying
Congrats the most fucked up map ever
Britian is with the romance languages and romania is slavic
Crazy shit
In (UK) English its "A Bird in the Hand is Worth Two in the Bush"
"The Brave Little Tailor" aka "Seven at One Blow" in the Brothers Grimm collection
That takes me back
Not to the 1800s of course, but to much loved books from my childhood in the 1970s.
To eat
In England we sometimes say "would you like a cup of char " and I never knew why until now
I genuinely don't see a change
Can someone explain
Edit: oh nevermind it's the cars
The Dutch are really good at city planning
I particularly love Rotterdam; it is supposedly an industrial/business city, but it is so green and is great for cycling around
Apparently they are not attached to old buildings so they don't have so much trouble as other places do when they need to change things
In the UK many girls are taken out of the country just for this horrible operation
So clearly many commenters haven't any first hand experience in this
THIS IS NOTHING NEW EVEN FOR INTER-UK LOADS
From 1996 to about 2004/5 I used to drive lorries delivering meat from an abbatoir to wholesalers, as well as pre-packed butchered products to supermarkets etc
Every load used to have to have a vetinary certificate with it
The abbatoir had to employ vets to complete those certificates and it wasn't uncommon to be waiting for the certificates to be completed
And this was back in the late 90s to the mid 2000s.
I’d have filled that much paperwork out every time I took a shit if i had to
Still worth it, maybe hire a British person to just fill out forms full time, job created right there
What a great thing Brexit has been for the UK
A couple of months in and we're yet to see any benefits from it
Let's party like it 1999
No, wait, 1929
Because the economy's bout to go souther than Shackleton
Lol this thread is embarrassing
Full of the typical europhile shite wanking over the breakup of the UK, pretending the EU is infallible
What a fantastic moment, I'm so glad we're finally leaving
It looked like we weren't going to actually do it at one point
Whoop, whoop
C'est la vie
Que sera sera
Et cetera, et cetera
Obstructionism by opposition parties in the UK, that is the sole reason
Horrendous waste of time and energy
At least now the government has a mandate so there will be one united UK team (hopefully) rather than the UK negotiators being constantly undermined by their own politicans
Oh leave the histrionics
I'm totally down for it, the sheer absurdity of Canada annexing the UK and acquiring a nuclear arsenal, along with 65 million people, would be worth the loss of sovereignty
WILL THE MUSLIMS INFECT BRITAIN’S SWANS WITH AIDS
Fucking dying
Judging by your comment we can turn Northern Ireland into the world's largest salt mine post Brexit so I'm sure we'll be fine
Feel like pure shit just want u back hun xx
Because its not uncertainty, its great news for the UK without getting delayed again and ending uncertainty
The role of an opposition party is not to oppose literally everything the government do for the sake of it
Very childish mentality
Cant we just rename Hull to Hell instead
Spoon
Long time no see
I would like to have that
[That's the joke]
It was a joke, mate
They called in the army last night, who have now installed trackers and signal jammers around the airport and specialist teams used to hunt them, but nobody has been found
The police have apparently identified "persons of interest" but that may be nothing
One theory a paper talked of was a team of people using more than one advanced grade drone that also pre-planned different flight routes and landing locations to swap out batteries at specific timings to avoid police/military detection
Which would require a lot of professional planning and capability
Others think it's just some idiot with his toy
The crown is so good
They regularly film New York scenes in the Northern Quarter of Manchester
It looks like Brooklyn
I live with an American here and it’s the first thing he said when he moved here
In fact they film quite a bit generally around the city
Northern Quarter is quite like Brooklyn architecturally
Makes me laugh when people say leavers in the UK just want an empire
The EU is literally created so that small euro nations can keep hold of empire ambitions
What did you use for the scale
Landmass
What does that even prove
The EU only makes sense and is perfect for all them former Soviet Union/Eastern European countries, The Baltic countries, Scandinavian countries, and for all them Balkan countries etc ie the EU is perfect for and makes sense for literally tiny, tiny populations, tiny everything, irrelevent, weak, powerless, backwater, little nothing countries, countries who've historically been nobodies, have not contributed much to the mass of human civilisation & humanity as a whole or not done anything of note, countries 99% of people in the world could not locate on a map cuz they dont matter and have never mattered etc
So grouping togther makes sense for them
But the UK, Germany & France are not those countries
They are by far, by many orders of magnitude they are greater and more influential & powerful on the global stage than every other country in the EU combined
The UK especially is a class apart
The EU from a geopolitical and soft and hard power view needs the UK more than the UK needs the EU
Also the idea that the EU is some unified country like the USA is laughable
The EU is actually just 27 countries all with their own cultures, languages, vastly different economies/income levels/interests/seperate bubbles etc Its still individual countries trying to screw each other over for their own benefit, there is no real unity or shared 'European' identity or nationality
You cant even agree on the smallest things or cannot even agree on the most essential basic things that a country needs to have to function as a proper country
How can you portray the EU as this one country when it lacks all the things that make a country a country
Lastly Brazil and India(China too for that matter) are all crumbling, extremely violent af, backward, poor(on an individual basis) 3rd world shit holes
Hell in Brazil many people leave their houses(and they're absolutely scared to leave their home to begin with, even to just walk to the shops) not knowing if they'll be back come the end of the day, they dont know if this day will be their last
such is the level of extreme violence, murder and fear that's rampant and outta control in Brazil
Brazil is an uncilivised, poor, uneducated, extremely violent dump full of murderous psychopaths and thugs
And India
lol they dont even have toilets & basic hygeine ffs, and im expected to believe they're greater than the UK
, Lol ffs get real people
India will most likely never have its shit together
And countries like China
well their military is nothing but a paper tiger, they have no way of projecting their force worldwide and China has no soft power to speak of etc
Outside of GDP numbers the Chinese are not a match for UK, Germany & France, not even close
This post is a joke, The EU has shown itself to be a joke
For all this talk about how powerful the EU is, well it hasnt shown much of that power, where is it
It doesnt exist
But reaminers keep telling me the EU doesn't want to be a single country/voice
These propaganda posts are starting to look manipulated
The UK is the largest soft power in the world, this really is meaningless
A beautiful work of art
No brexiteers thinks that, only remainers and euros say that remainers think that
Actually, we moved from 2nd place to 1st last year on the global soft power index
1950s architecture has a lot to answer for
Bruh there is no historical buildings in the US
> Holy fuck who even argues that both sides were equally bad
Tbh a lot of them aren't even Nazis, they're just those types of kids who just want to be "smarter than the rest" and "go against the grain" to prove that they're "free thinkers who don't listen to THE MAN
". They dismiss everything as being "Victor's writing history and propaganda to make themselves look good".
If the US, UK or Russian government said the sky is blue, these people would say "Not true, it's a government lie
im glad northern uk got better
No way the UK is that low for Al the time
Looks like all the unemployed people just moved to the employed places
Apparently zero hour contracts make up 2% of the working population
could you send a link
I will happily watch this lol
Sorry but this is twee and stupid and I’m not really sure why everyone is obsessed with not living in the US
Maybe they don’t do this over there because they’ve got more important things to be dealing with than Norway
Imagine inventing a sexual encounter to own the Euros
USA, why don't you just prepare your chicken like normal fucking people
We don't want your shitty chemical-washed chicken
I'd rather pay extra for organic
I also imagine the shelf-life would be decreased due to transport and varying temperatures onboard of planes
What's the situation with the UK after brexit, we be getting this shitty chicken
Shichicken
You sweet-taking devil you, I'm in
Yeah, but the majority of people won't buy that shit
Eventually, shops will stop stocking what they can't sell and the chemical-washed chicken deal will be left in the dust
I mean, we may be British, but we aren't *American*.
With our current food regulations, restaurants would be forced to disclose it on their menus
Can't imagine those restaurants will keep many customers after that
It'll all come back around to slap Boris in the face
Unless, of course, those regulations change
I bloody hope not, I'm happy with the current standards and I was hoping they would only get better in the future
This is amazing
Go Queenie
Let's get to no
she technically has power despite some of it being transferred to parliment in recent times
she tends to use it in favour of the people
she has been involved in something to do with syrian missile strikes and she is probably wiser than alot of politicians due to her life time experiences

I love that indefinable but very specific 'Europeness' about all of your fabulous places
So long space comrade
great idea
What's this got to with Europe really
Is there any legislation for it
Not trying to argue, genuinely curious

Cringe
Guessing Norway is #1
Ouch
Poor UK
France and UK neck and neck, just like always
I think the UK may drop a few places soon
Already happened
We were 2nd in 2015
Stalin was worse than Hitler and is responsible for more death and genocide, he systematically starved even his own people
Soviet forces raped and pillaged their way to Berlin attacking those who they deemed subhuman, mainly the Polish
The Soviet Union was perfectly happy to let Hitler and Nazi Germany do as they please until Germany invaded them going against the non-aggression pact they had together
They did not recognise the Nazis as a threat until this point
Neither were good, both were atrocious and celebrating the Soviet Union is no better than celebrating Nazi Germany
Not sure if how accurate this is, is funny or depressing
kinda both I guess
Unelected
Shit post
What’s funny about this is the eu act as if they are the normal ones, they are not
the uk is the normal one, controlling their borders, etc
like 90% of the countries on earth
Deserve it how
You don't have to be ashamed of your country
In my experience, not really
Or at least it's counteracted by Brits who have an opposite view
You epitomise the phrase "tory"
Well yes it it is, it’s normal to control your own borders
see 90% + of nations on earth
Easy to have high/ish standards of living when you don’t even pay for your own defence
As a Labour supporter, and the next generation, it's our issue just as much as yours
But how much do you hear about English affairs
I always wonder what it's like on the news, because BBC news never reports about you
Yeah because the eu then was the same as it is today
Not hard when you are 37 people in the country
You share our pain of actually wanting to watch something that isnt he news at 6pm
Well we’ve invaded Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan in the past 15 years so
Pretty sure France had a lead in the Libya one
And yet they moan about the border at Calais every day
No deal it is, we can't allow the EU to try and annex UK territory
Actually, the EU saw this coming
Back before the vote, we tried to renegotiate our membership, saying “Its this or the the vote”. Polls said we’d vote to leave
They rejected the deal, we voted to leave, and now in 2 months they’ll be £150/week poorer
They need us, they’ll make the deal, because the EU only serves to support its own interests
Theres a reason the British Standards mark is held in more respect than the CE mark: We don’t accept the bare minimum
Never have
We’ve stood alone against the world’s largest armies less than 80 years ago
27 nations don’t scare us
Yeah we’ve gone full idiot now, just stop the food and fuel and it will sort itself out within the year
The rich who orchestrated all this will be fine
It’s been fun while it lasted
So long and thanks for all the fish
Hope you like asylum seekers because we’re coming soon
We love camping
Reckon I could swim to France on a clear day
Wish me luck
Off to get a wet suit and brush up on my parle en Francais
Before the US and the Soviet Union joined, we fought to stop the invasion
Also, we were the world superpower until one of the wars
God made the world, the Dutch made the Netherlands
White people, simply lol
A very strange people
in Sweden its probably because the kids can actually afford accommodation and to go to uni

That’s actually kind of dark

Possibly but also a definite correlation with over protective mothers who still do their adult babies washing and cooking for them

Hi Switzerland, sorry but we're not learning your languages so you're gonna need to add Swiss English to your vocab
Cheers, Bye
Great map
Brits as always going to Spain
At least it'll be easier to protect France now
Nah Gibraltar is Belgian now
Gibraltar is the new Scotland
Does this now mean Jersey is the part of Spain that they want to claim as theirs

Looks like the eyes from one of those Greek penis helmets
Castles like this figuratively get my dick hard
Good luck with transitioning the Scottish highlands
In a way, I think this drive to view maps in purely economic terms may explain some the of unpopularity of the EU
I’m willing to bet that this map almost certainly mirrors population density to some extent (excluding the top of Sweden
Christ knows how they’ve managed that)
And where there are more people concentrated together, more money gets made
Who knew
Would be nice if we still had a few areas of unspoiled natural beauty (and relative economic fallow-ness) left in Europe, no
does this mean in terms of stuff built or something else
Wessex is a transition period
Having lived here my whole life I truthfully cant tell of that's accurate
How come Portugal is mostly red with some blue
Why no yellow areas
Yellow gang lets go
I feel like the West coast of Ireland should be excluded seeing as there isn't a single motorway or train line along the whole NW coast
I think this is probably slightly misleading and skewed by multinationals raising the GDP per capita
Article about it here:
But apart from that, what did the Romans ever do for us
What's that one way over to the south east
And the North African outpost
Why was the Mediterrainian(and its surrounding areas, North Africa too) and Southern Europe waaaaaaay more urbanised than Northern Europe(where cities and towns really were not a thing, why was that)
What's the African city
Mamucium / Manchester standing by
I am from Warrington - which was a market town by the Mersey established by the Romans as it was a crossing point
I now live in Stockport, which was a market town established by the Romans
I am Roman Catholic
Romans
Teutoberg Forest best day of my life
And fortifying Northern England against the Scots
I live in a British roman town, Cirencester
The romans named it Corinium
We have a great museum about it
Those aren’t Glasgow and Edinburgh, they’re Cramond and Old Kilpatrick which we’re roman settlements
Nice Sopianaes
And Bristol City
They’ll be riding canoes in a few years

I did the same with getting my Dutch passport last year, Brexit can suck it

Yeah, this is some weird shit:

- Said post is just vague, sanctimonious shilling for the EU
Im kinda confused I thought to show Forty thousand it would have a comma like 40,000 rather than a point 40
000
Is this just an alternate way of representing the number
So I get downvoted for asking a question

The comic is in French so, I doubt the author is American or supports that view
And then occupied Europe all the way up to Lisbon
The US didnt save anyone from nazis, it saved half of Europe from the Soviet Union
>the Nazis
>WW1
> India + Pakistan
I still don't get why it's our fault that Jinnah popularised the Pakistan movement (even then, the movement existed without him)
Lets assume we *don't* partition India and let them sort it out on their own; would we get the blame for the inevitable shitshow that would happen between Pakistani nationalists and Indians against the creation of Pakistan
Not to mention we aren't bloody responsible for Hindu nationalists like Modi's gang nowadays, who alienate their own Muslims within India
Oh fuck off, at that point you might as well say Germany owes Italy reparations over the Gothic sack of Rome
Confirmed cases actually makes places that are testing more look bad, obviously
Not saying that is what is happening here but it is not a good metric by its self to measure how well a country is dealing with it
Geographically its much closer to Baghdad than it is to Saint Petersburg
Its also located fully on the Asian part of Turkey(and if Turkey is considered not European then Georgia is likwise defo not European either), so its not even in Europe
Last time i checked its in Asia
Georgia
yeah not Europe im afraid
r/Asia is that way>>>>>
Is "aamu" the Finnish word for "AM"?
That's basically a yes

awwwwww
You're wrong
Most Armenians have black hair, tanned skin and long noses
Western Turks look European
Missing doggerland
We should bring back doggerland
Italy had some thicc thighs
Kinda off topic but isn't 'Lest we forget' meant for soldiers
Which means it happened within the lifetime of most people in here
Iceland searching UK is interesting, any idea why
Italian food, Italian weather, Italian wine
These are the finest things in life
I hate to be that guy but the UK isn’t a country lol
I'm sorry fren, we'll be in benidorm in the millions by August <3
Sneaky Spaniards doing that to Gibraltar all day too
Denmark have Bang & Olufsen and Sweden has Volvo so both pretty based
Finland ngl, not sure what you got
Do Icelandic people go on holiday here much
I went to Iceland in 2014 and absolutely love it
Although it was summer so always light but I think it is one of my most favourite countries I have visited
It’s a group of countries lmao
That is quite interesting
Definitely cheaper than Iceland however beautiful your country may be :)
ok I am wrong Nokia is OG
And the eu ain’t considered a country is it
Still one, but one country in the Union ;)
I’m going off majority, and nobody thinks the eu is a country
My definition of a country is a strong faction with its own government and military, owning a vast amount of land and a sustainable economy along with trade relations with other countries
Then respect the fact I have my own opinion, just be open to others’.
Damn people come together to promote equality and loads of scared people do nothing but show hate in the comments
so these nazis clearly don't remember what happened last time
It shows just how terrified people are of what they don't understand
For many innocent refugees it's hard enough to build a life, never mind with all the hatred shown towards them
then i fully support kicking their asses again
Oh yes, their hate towards people like Muslims probably comes from searching up "bad things the Quran says" rather than actually knowing about the full religion
I never got why schools in the USA don't teach kids about religion
That sounds pretty intense, we usually started around eight years old and learnt about various traditions and holidays
If I wanted all the atheists are evil stuff I'd just talk to my grandma
It's interesting, if that happened in most other countries, the people would fight for equality
Its crazy how much influence media has on some people, it's created a hatred for millions
I told you that France turned the frogs gay
Now check Africa and the Middle East
The  map isn't accurate
Homosexuality was legalied in 1967 in the UK
Pretty much every single map posted on r/europe is inaccurate
With the UK the 1967 is the partial decriminalisation rather than it being legal, so for instance you could only have gay sex in a private dwelling if the doors were locked, there was no one else on the premises and both parties were over 21
Also you couldn't have sex in a hotel as that was considered a public place and no more than 2 individuals
Also it was a illegal in the armed forces until 2000
so "legalisation" is a bit disingenuous
Is that so, I wouldn't have thought that you would forget the napoleonic or the world wars that quickly
A patrician in the streets but plebeian in the sheets
Did they get up early to put their towels on the chair lift
/r/deadbedrooms
The boots, the three quarter length trousers, the hat, the expressions that say that Poland is next on the list

Ireland vs The Sea
You must be a right shmigus-dingus if you think this is a real thing
Check out r/belarus
TLDR The dictator there has falsified Sunday's election results, declaring himself the winner with 80% of the votes when in reality he probably got something like 9%. This is an insult to the Belarusian people and they have been protesting en masse for the last 2 days whilst facing severe repression from the police & military
Жыве Беларусь!
He is like a real version of Major General Alladeen
And then you have the children on Reddit going "haha communism funny"...
Ad hominem moment
Hear hear
To be fair that's kind of true about any country
And places like York, Liverpool, Oxford or Cambridge still get huge amounts of international tourists each year, its just talked about less
Assume all the British ones are just cabbies
Solid 4th place
You brought up a valid point, and then followed it up exclusively with examples of things that are now completely unrelated lmao
We use Christmas for a holiday because there are specific traditions associated with it that we enjoy
It has nothing to do with religion at this point
And we will be using the Gregorian calender for hundreds of years, until something really unimaginably important happens, because our lives and history are so ingrained in it
We will still be using it in eras where an average person won't even come across someone in their life who's gone to church
Happy birthday Lithuania
Happy Independence Day
I got you bro
No problem
Spend wisely
I'm absolutely fine with Scotland and NI holding referendums on their position within the UK
Northern Ireland costs us a lot of money and if Scotland doesn't want to stay then it's best for all parties if we split
A UK of just England and Wales isn't bad and can actually have a very bright future
Let them go if they want to go
Just wish they would hurry up and do it already
Give them another referendum , I'm tired of hearing about it
UK rids itself of 60% of its budget deficit
If it has to undergo the same scrutiny as any other applicant it'll struggle as it isn't likely to meet budget deficit requirements even if it gets 100% of the tax receipts from North Sea Oil
Sturgeon's spending plans depend on £7
1Bn of NSO tax receipts
2015 it was nil, 2016 actually cost the UK over £300m as they paid out more in subsidies and other payments than they received in tax, 2018 it went up to just £1Bn on a substantial rise in prices
I feel bad for Scotland
Another border
Yippee
Wales are thinking of breaking away too
Good luck Scotland, you'll see your 10% English population rise dramatically were that to happen in the event of Brexit no doubt
Mate only 600,000 more people voted remain than leave in Scotland, and the majority of Wales also voted to leave
The Scots should "suffer" because we are a democracy and vote as a *nation*, not as individual ones
London also voted to remain but Peterborough voted leave, should one city be in the EU, and one not
40% voted leave
not exactly a pro-EU country
British nationalists
like the scotz
Godspeed mate
I hope you guys can find a way to accept some stowaways from the south
Going just as "The Kingdom" might be a bit brazen in international relations though lol
>The “United” comes from the union of the Scottish and English crowns
Wrong
The union between England and Scotland was known as Great Britain, not the UK
The UK is the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, that is why the full title of the UK is "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
a man can dream, the amount of money we sink into N Ireland and Scotland is ridiculous
I really wish they would leave so we would stop funding them
Feels bloody great
Once again why does the graph showing 13% exclude London and the South East when they're as much a part of England as the Midlands and Yorkshire
It is not only possible to calculate Scotland's budget deficit based on current spending, [it has already been done]  and the picture isn't good
Whilst it has reduced it hasn't reduced as much as the rest of the UK and is still three times that of the rest of the UK and almost three times that of the EU budget deficit target of 3%. Remember that as a member of the EU you'd have to have the proposed budget agreed if the deficit is larger than the EU's target 3%. Bye bye free prescriptions and university places
Scotland controls a lot of its own spending, NHS and education for example, as well as some of the taxation such as income tax
I don't think many Englishmen are going to be getting riled up simply because Scotland are pondering EU membership
Half of England is still pondering EU membership
population doesnt equal electorate
But one of the least pro-eu countries inside the EU
>in the words of the Treaty, "United into One Kingdom by the **Name of Great Britain**"
>The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707
On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the Parliament of **Great Britain**,
Also your "sources" are neither sources, nor support your claim, i have no idea why you linked them, did you even bother to read them before posting them
> Because it shows how ridiculous it is trying to calculate 'shares of a deficit'
Not comparing nation to nation
> Honestly, how can 8% of the population be responsible for 60% of the UK deficit
It is a laughable statistic
How the fuck do you think free prescriptions and free university places are paid for in Scotland
The universities and the pharmacists bill the Scottish government
Scots also have poorer health than English too so healthcare costs to the government are higher because of that too
Also income wise there's just less money generating business in Scotland and they're businesses that generate less profit per business than England, especially London
Wages are also lower too so you have more public sector expenditure with lower tax receipts per capita
So is 60% of the UK deficit down to Scotland or not
If it is then it doesn't matter how you visualise the data
You can visualise it any way you want but the plain truth of the matter is London, the South East, Yorkshire and the Midlands are part of England so the English contribution to the total UK deficit is just a few percent
Your graph is willing to lump in Edinburgh into Scotland I noticed
You can't exclude London and the SE in England's figures just because they happen to have an inconvenient surplus but include Edinburgh in Scotland's because it has a convenient one so I would argue the graph on the right is the misleading one as it requires London and the South East to not be part of England but Edinburgh to remain as part of Scotlands figure to have any validity to the claim of 13%.
What do you think the words " of Great Britain" mean here
not referenced as the UK of Great Britain
Also, i already quoted the actual treaty which literally refers the name of the new entity as Great Britain
Your source is an archived version of 1 web page which no longer exists
Why would you consider this a more trust worthy source than the actual treaty itself
It isn't meaningless, the calculations have been done by people much more better educated in it than you and I taking into account things like the Barnett Formula and North Sea Oil revenues
If we're talking about over-centralisation Scotland suffers the same, the vast majority of its economy being from the M8 belt
> What I am saying is that the 'deficit' figure isn't really useful for more than anything that describing UK finances
It isn't really useful for the independence argument
It is but not the independence argument you're thinking of
It is very useful to those in England wanting independence from a Scotland who seem to do nothing but blame them for everything wrong in their nation
> I think the clear implication is that it is not
Nobody agrees with you including you
As it currently stands Scotland is responsible for 60% of the UK deficit
> Are you joking
7 of the 10 poorest areas in the EU are in England
But the so are some of the richest including London which as the world's largest financial centre is the richest in the EU

You've not denied that under the status quo that Scotland is responsible for 60% of the deficit
You've merely tried to argue that if things changed that it wouldn't be and I don't dispute that
> And as the capital of the UK, not just England, a portion of that wealth is owed to Scotland
Only because of the Barnett formula
Does your 13% claim take into account removing the money Scotland gets because of that
> it's oil fields that bring big business
Not Scotlands or North Sea Oil
Especially North Sea oil when there was so little profit made the UK government LOST money in 2016, over £300 million

For some reason officially its 70 but everyone goes at 80
and the government doesn't care
That 80 at the bottom so you don’t do the island in a minute flat
Yeah all the signs are in mph in the UK
I drove from the UK (Norwich) to Poland (Poznan) and back last Christmas
I have to say that driving through Germany was absolute bliss

Election isnt referendum though
Its in no way representative of a referendum
SNP will always score higher in elections than they will in referendums (also I think everyone realises there won't be another vote on scottish independence for at least a decade or 2, so its not a barrier to voting SNP)
But the way it is going, they will eventually leave
Maybe not the next vote or the one after
It seems to be like Ireland and the Lisbon Treaty
Keep on having referendums until the "correct" answer wins

All I remember is that turkey was fighting the Kurds who were fighting Assad and Isis
I don't know much about their culture and where their historic land is but it seems as if turkey is trying to prevent them breaking off Turkish territory
Like I said, I don't know much
It's a unique topic considering the circumstances of the Kurds, Turkey, and who is supporting who
Thanks for the info
I was more in favour of the Kurds to start with but this made me more supportive of them
Even without what's happening to the Kurds, I still hate erdogan

There's a Finnish tv show called Poliisit
It follows round police in various Finnish towns
The episodes when it's mid summer (Heuva Juhannus

People get absolutely trashed
A bit sad, but it makes for good telly

They were common in the UK until about 20 years ago, as a way of transferring money, but I don't remember them ever being used in shops

Ahh Ladybower reservoir, love Sheffield having this beauty on its doorstep (actually 1/3rd of Sheffield is within the Peaks
Grew up here and I can confidently say, it does not get old
Ahh, I do miss the Peaks when I'm not in the UK
Sure
It has some pretty grim parts, being a lot of ex-industrial-turned-council house estates and the like
The city centre is pleasant, there's *alot* of green spaces, a 3rd of the city is in the peak district (NW, W, SW sides) and has access to the rest of the peaks too, along with being only a couple hours away from the big national parks further north if that's your thing
Plus the water tastes great
Tbh when I'm travelling on a train or coach, unless it's a stop at a small village like the trans pennine line, i can't really get a great impression of the town/city
Although the train line from Sheffield east through Rotherham *is* grim and makes you want to puke
Yeah Sheffield is unbelievably underrated
But tbh I'd rather it that way, don't want an influx of rich southerners like you get in Leeds and Manny

I thought the UK would be higher, until I just remembered that we are one of the highest countries where students and young adults live with their parents
We complain about the lack of housing because the government prioritises business over homes
We have more than enough space to cater to the people but they have no interest in doing so
Not to mention the messed up laws that benefit landlords and leasing agreements, so no wonder no one wants an apartment
Never mind the fact I don't want strangers living above or below me where I can hear every footstep, door slam and everything else
I want my own private property where I can do as I please without disrupting other people and vice versa
I'm entitled to that
I mean out of living in a flat and a house I'd take the house
I only call them apartments when I fell like being a posh wanker
Albeit when I do see new flats being built they are labelled as apartments
How come
It wouldn't be my ideal nor many other people's. I'm lucky enough to live in the countryside, I'm sure a lot of other people would live in rural areas if they could
Let me expand a bit
By entitled, I mean the majority of the British people are very hardworking, dedicated individuals, many of which are workaholics
We rarely have nice weather so we spend a lot of time indoors compared to the rest of Europe, especially now we are in lockdown and so many of us are now working from home
Unlike the people that live in places like sunny Spain, Italy, Portugal etc we spend a lot of our time in our own homes (again, the point I made about our weather)
So as you might imagine, the British hate the idea of being stuck inside with a bunch of noisy people living above and below us
But considering our work ethic, we also deserve to be rewarded with something
The government thinks the best reward is to spend spend spend on pointless crap, but the reward we want is the opportunity to buy a home free from disruption
It's not a big ask, it's a very fair ask
We have more than enough land to go around for everyone but our government keeps prioritising shops and apartment buildings
It might be acceptable in countries where you are spending most of your time outside in the sun, but here it's not
Humans are annoying creatures so when you spend a lot of time indoors surrounded by them, you'd may as well at least try and surround yourself with a few you love in a house instead of the old woman upstairs that vacuums at 6am or student downstairs that thinks 3 am on a Wednesday is prime time for blasting Stormzy

I guess I'll have to sound like a Corbyn Tankie for this, but from the perspective of the Socialist world, invading Czechoslovakia was a perfectly reasonable response to what they perceived as a NATO plot to overthrow the government of the Czechoslovaks
In the same vein that the USA, UK and France would fight wars to prevent communist takeovers in other countries
These are all acts of self preservation, as each side assumed the other was always poised and ready to launch WW3, and any weakness in your alliance could potentially be your defeat in the coming war
Socialism doesnt preach perpetual race war and extermination of foreigners like Nazism does
No because that wasnt really a danger to the existence of the British state, unlike comprising the Warsaw pact which did pose a "losing nuclear world war 3" danger to Russia
According to experts the reason Brits are so fugly today is because the vikings took all the attractive, good looking hot people from Britain during their many raids for British slaves(who were worth alot, highly prized were Brits by the vikings)
So over time the Brits got more and more fugly as the Scandanavians got more and more attractive
That's why we Brits are fugly, its not our fault see
In all seriousness though: Just why were British slaves so highly desired and prized by the vikings
, What made Brits so special to them
Since you start speaking it so young
Do you have a thick Swedish accent when you speak English or do you sound like native English person, where if somebody didnt know you were Swedish they'd think you were English
Looks like a great opportunity to study the local geology though
I’m a Con voter and typically consider myself just right of the centre

They’ve removed a statue of Grant in the the US
Ya know, the Union General fighting against the Confederates
In the US, a BLM mob tore down the statue of a Norwegian-American *anti slavery abolitionist* who died fighting against the Confederacy
It's a fucking iconoclasm at this point
At this point, I bet statues of any notable figure from before WWII is coming under fire from the mob
Hell, they went after Lord Baden Powell, the bloke that founded the Scouts movement
Bismarck was a Conservative, Monarchist, anti-Catholic, anti-Social Democrat, etc
He is controversial in Germany independently of the Battleship
The fact that Prussia literally doesn't exist anymore doesn't help his legacy, since Bismarck was more of a Prussian nationalist than a true pan-German
Bavarians, Rhinelanders, etc
generally don't care for him, or even see him in a negative light
Yes, but not in the most "diplomatic" way
Bismarck was/is actually controversial among German nationalists because he "didn't finish the job". Bismarck cared more about securing Prussian power than actually about unifying the German people, and he deliberately excluded the Austrians (back then, considered Germans) because he didn't want Protestant Prussia sharing any power and authority with Catholic Austria
Bismarck also had the whole Kulturkampf thing going on (his culture war with the Vatican to ensure the Pope had no influence in Germany), which alienated Catholic Germany
Wrong
You've started a Finnish fire that will burn for a thousand years

Russia gets what Russia wants
They see Ukraine in their sphere of influence along with Belarus
Once Eastern Ukraine is in their influence they will try and go for the Baltic’s.
The use of cyber, hybrid and conventional warfare in Ukraine has made Russia’s intentions obvious
They want Ukraine under their influence and once Ukraine ousted the corrupt pro Russian leader it was obvious to Russia that they needed to take it by those types of warfare
Like Hitler in Czech Republic and Poland, he is using Russian ethnicity and background to launch a war in Ukraine with the overall goal of conquering it
What can the west do
Well nothing, similar to Britain and France with Hitler, we don’t want to risk a war defending a foreign country and so unless something drastic happens (It won’t, the Kremlin is smart) the west aren’t going to get directly involved leaving the people of Eastern Europe to defend themselves from the Russian federation which has the main foreign policy of re-gaining the soviet sphere of influence
Blame Germany for buying gas from Russia
We've really been meaning to give that back
I know it’s a long read so I will sum it up, basically Russia knows that Lithuania has close ties to the west, larger western support and a low number of ethnic Russians
So yeah it’s going to be tough for them to subject Lithuania in their sphere
But as the document suggests, Russia has slowly bought out most of the Lithuanian newspapers to try and slowly spread Russian propaganda and narrative, slowly trying to integrate the Lithuanian economy with Russia’s and trying to get Russian music, tv and culture more mainstream there
Lithuania is going to be tough for Russia to get a grip on but with western incompetence Russia have got a long term plan
But yeah with a general pro western political class and population it’s going to take time for them to gain Lithuanian influence (if at all)
I’m not comparing them two, just comparing their methods of taking over countries using hybrid warfare and ethnic population like Hitler did in Poland and Czech Republic
The €5m fine is a cap but if EA were to continue their practices then a larger fine could be imposed

> And how do you differentiate if someone actually invites you
With a thorough mutual understanding of the relationship between the two persons involved
Social context is essential
Asking someone you just met in a pub 'to dinner' is weird; asking someone you've known for 10 years is probably truthfully said
Whenever I asked a Russian 'how are you
' they *always* replied 'нормально', whether they were good or not
It's a similar response to the English one
You're meant to reply: it's a conversation starter
Just not (usually) with the actual truth
You can answer the first one is odd, if you know the person and aren't just unloading on a perfect stranger then it is an invitation to say something isn't ok
But the default is just to say something similar back
I do as well so I'm not sure that's an anglophone thing, more an ego thing
Because it's not a literal question of how you are; it's nothing more than a greeting and conversation starter
"That's not bad" means, in most circumstances, that the speaker is impressed by something but doesn't want to appear un-British by being enthusiastic about it
For example, if somebody asked for a restaurant recommendation I might say "you could try the Fat Duck, it has 3 stars so it's not bad".
However, we can also use the phrase "it's not \*too\* bad" if we are presented with something awful but are being a bit polite to say that
For example, you invite me round to your house for some food but you clearly make a complete mess of cooking it and burn it awfully
When we eat it you might apologise for it being horrible because it's burnt, so I might reply with "no, don't worry, it's not too bad", which basically translates as "this is a horrible meals, but I'm just managing to get some of it down to be polite
There is no 'problem': they're cultural differences
Well depending on where you are that's kind of rude, isn't life fun
It's fine we're infamous for not wanting to change how we act when faced with cultural differences
So cant fault you for doing the same
In a business environment
With other Brits, exactly this way
With non-native speakers, unless I knew that they would understand the actual implications of what I meant by "not bad" I might be tempted to phrase things a little differently
Here's a little story about the church and Poland
My sons mother is from Poland, a little city in the North called Słupsk
I visited some 5 times, very fond memories, always good weather, very cheap living
The first and second time I visit, in the centre there was a large beer garden
The bar was a pop up 'Tyskie' dome surrounded by benches and large umbrellas
The first time I sat there I noticed a lot of BMWs and Mercedes pulling up and men in leather jackets standing about taking
I asked my lady what was going on and she whispers "Mafia". I say "Holy shit, mafia" and she "shhhhhhs" me hard
Anyway, first two times we visit, I spend a fair but of time enjoying pints of Tyskie in the warm weather there
The third time, it was gone
I ask her mum where the Tyskie dome went and she tells me the Church didn't approve of the Mafia conducting their business in front of the church, so away it went
And that's how I learnt who wears the pants in Poland
ERMAGURD WHOLESOME POGGERS MOMENT

Cities like Rio, Buenos Aires, Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, São Paulo, etc

Countries that didnt get bombed suffered similar fates

>England has a population 10 times higher than any of the other countries in the UK
This means when it comes to voting, the UK gets what England wants (9 times out of 10)
I having nothing against England, this is not a matter of being childish, and I voted No in the independence referendum
This is my exact problem with a lot of Scottish people, you want Scotland to be treated "equally" to England, which in your mind means that Scottish people as a whole should have as much say as English people as a whole, despite England having 10x as many people and that Scotland should be able to block whatever it likes
What you want is not equality or fairness it is the exact opposite
The UK is a democracy and policy should be dictated by the majority
If the Scottish people feel that their opinions do not align with England's and that they are unable to affect any sort of change in the UK then they are more than welcome to leave the UK and hand back that £13 billion subsidy back to England
>All I'm saying is that there is a blatant flaw in 4 nations being governed by a single parliament,
Except for the fact that England and only England is the only part of the UK or any UK dependencies that is wholly governed by the UK parliament, it has no devolved government like everywhere else
This would not be a problem if England got to decide everything but because of issues like the west lothian question that is not the case
Pretty sure I was on this train
That's a good point actually
Hadn't thought of that - mostly because I live in the north and drive to work
But my stepfather, an avid trainspotter and lover of all things trains, said that they're cutting train numbers next week
Now I'm wondering how effective that will be
If, proportionally, the number of trains is cut lower than the number of commuters, that will just make things worse
Which was, I imagine, a spectacular mistake
But refused to allow the Brits and French to send soldiers and war materiel through their country to aid Finland
Plan R 4 was only intended to take place if Germany violated Norway's neutrality, as per the article

Well, realpolitik is still realpolitik, countries dont have "friends", as Charles de Gaulle said
But, I do think the "US annexation
" Boogeyman falls flat when you look at Canada and see that they have NAFTA and higher standards of living than the UK (and France, Spain, Italy and Belgium
Given that Canada's population is half of ours, and their GDP smaller, how come they havent been reduced to this horrible wasteland that the USA supposedly will turn us into
Likewise for New Zealand
Tiny country, small population, outside the EU, still thriving and doing better than us
Edit: USMCA replaced NAFTA, but according to ex Canadian PM Chrétien, it barely changes anything
If it dies then it's the EUs fault
>The English arent that much different to Americans anyway
Sure, besides the vastly different views on things such as Healthcare policy, gun control, government systems, Police's role, schooling systems, etc
Propaganda*
True, but I excluded Japan because they have double our population (127 million Japanese VS 65 million Britons), so they're not a "small" country
But yeah, Japan in the 1980s was literally a juggernaut that became the worlds second largest economy
They shit the bed in 1989 with the stock bubble bursting, but are still a respected and rich nation today
Because they fell for the PR/propaganda
Of course countries, or supranational entities, will always try to make you think they are emotional entities like you and me, but that wont change the fact that they work based on interests and not "friendship" or anything of that sort
Yeah, but who cares about all that when it comes to the quality of life for the people
I'd much rather have the UK emulate Switzerland and become a do-nothing country, than continue to play at geopolitics and have our population live inferior lives to others
Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, New Zealand, etc
Yeah they're utterly irrelevant on the world stage, they wont be deciding what happens in the Middle East, but does that negatively affect them
Do the people of these countries somehow miss out on anything by not vaporizing Arabs
Hell, they actually gain respect and admiration for being peaceful, while we are subject to terrorist attacks and international scorn due to controversial foreign policy
I'd like the average British citizen to live well in our peaceful corner of the globe, as opposed to living a mediocre life because the military needed more money to drop bombs on cavemen in Afghanistan
Fair enough, USMCA is the new name right
The quote is attributed to both men, and also Lord Palmerston
Well, Brexit still sucks, the scenario I'm describing here would be a status quo at *best*, the UK won't be improved by Brexit
Yeah, they're intertwined, but it often looks like ideals take the back seat when the stakes are high
Communist China and tne Capitalist USA manage to form a quasi-alliance during the Cold War after all
We're talking about living conditions and per capita statistics
Being rich as a country doesnt necessarily mean life is good there
The UK and France are far wealthier than the Netherlands or Denmark, but Dutch and Danish standards of living are way better than French or British
Another example of course is Switzerland
GDP wise, Switzerland has a smaller economy than the US state of Pennsylvania, but I think I'd rather live in Switzerland than Pennsylvania
(no offence to Pennsylvanians, Quakers and William Penn are cool)
Don’t go by cases go by deaths or even deaths per million people as deaths are they only thing they can reliably count
Most beautiful capital city in Europe
Not surprising
Spez [stated] that most of the government requests were porn related
Turkey and Russia can suck my fat one
Especially germany, they're big on censoring shit over there (mainly anything to do with swastikas or nazis)
Spez [stated] that most of the government requests were porn related
Posts about their president in blackface

I can never remember which one most countries have (i know UK has a prime minister and US has a president but i cant remember any others)
This is silent hill irl
Unfortunately it we will have to wait many years until china loosens its grip, and even worse, it's strengthening
That's the problem
We can't compare with china to free the said regions
tl;dr Beer and Banks
Why can’t I find this at all on the bbc
The Troubles pales in comparison with what's going to take place in France, IMO
This is very bad
Stop war tbh
Sort of, there's one too many potatoes in Latvia and Russia 2 (Kaliningrad etc) should be rainbow
No, Russia occupied Crimea
Fuck bros
**BROS**
It's funny that this is gilded twice
Some folk are highly susceptible to propaganda
Its also a little disingenuous to  make a claim to the Englishmen who fought and died
Pretty sure most were probably just fighting for their homes and family, to stop the Germans invading Britain or becoming too strong to stop
Highly doubt many were actively fighting to bring peace to the continent for people whose norm was nationalism/patriotism rather than altruism at least for the common man or women
People shouldn't speak so directly on behalf of the dead when a claim can't be proved almost decisively, that goes for my own comment
He is just using emotive language in an underhanded way to make English people feel like they betrayed their countrymen who came before them
If the share of votes, reflect that the elderly voted for brexit (plus a few anecdotal stories of brexitter veterans), it suggests those ww2 Englishmen would vote out as well
He is building a false narrative to make English people feel shame
Edited: to reflect jewishbaratheon's point
The earth is now equipped to start fucking the solar system and maybe beyond
How is Britain the warm one
What the hell is going on
It was -5° here in the West Midlands, and it’s currently snowing which didn’t happen for 6 years until December 2017
This winter can lick my left bollock

Is there another one for today

These days its a museum, I suspect you mean [Windsor Castle]
... like well done
Idk
Imagine her trying to lecture anyone about climate change or the environment when she’s spawned 7 children all probably with their own staff etc
So was the voting corrupt
Or were 54% of Austrians really short-sighted, ill-informed, narcissistic tools of the Establishment
With the unfolding calamity of mass immigration causing pain, destruction and chaos throughout the Western world, it beggars belief that any pro immigration politician can still win an election
Wake up people
yeah because electing the left wing Hollande was such a great thing for France
Thankfully there is no chance that the left wing will win again, it will be between Fillon and Le Pen
Fake news
No way this is in Finland and these kids are not Finnish
I mean look at how close they're all standing next to each other
Personal space is being violated en masse + one of them is evening smiling
:O.. No Finn would be seen smiling or even tolerate their precious personal space being invaded like that
So this has to be another country not Finland
Why
[*Yes you do, you've just used a double negative
The red spots may look like houses to the untrained eye but they are clearly lava plumes
It's called sarcasm you buffoon
Yes
The more 'diverse' a country becomes, the more centralised and militarised the state needs to be in order to retain control
Lee Kuan Yew wasnt kidding when he said democracy would sow chaos in Singapore due to ethnic diversity
Lizzie will keep going til Charles is 6 feet under
Even she knows he'd make a shit king
Fucking Charles
Why did you choose that picture of Prince Charles
In the UK it actually changed recently in 2011
"Sons and daughters of any future UK monarch will have equal right to the throne,"
One interesting fact is that the Queen is head of state of 16 countries and all 16 countries had to agree on the change
He actually is
But more bizarrely, it's not arabs but [badgers] which draw the prince's ire
Charles is more of a natural gizmos hippy actually
This hurts my heart
The Dutch are such kind people
Should they not be punished in the country they committed these crimes
European elections are too complex
I think Brits are pretty much over the hole Falklands thing
It's generally the Argies that keep bringing it up
English people don't get pissed off about Malvinas at all
We barely even know generally that there's any sort of fuss about it
Argentinians on the other hand
I honestly don't think that anyone, except *THE* most knuckle-dragging EDL supporting idiot, would get anywhere near annoyed at *"Las Malvinas son Argentinas"*... and even then the aforementioned nationalistic wankers would probably just laugh in your face before repeatedly chanting "IN-GER-LUUUUND".
Far more effective IMO would be:
>The England football team is shit
...or variations on that theme
Lol saying the Falklands are Argentinian wont annoy us English because they're still English atm
It'd just make us laugh at you
You want to annoy somebody in England
Call football soccer
"Wow this is highly upvoted
time to see what silly stuff got the continent so worked up
*"Les Malvinas
*flips table*
I don't get the one for England/Wales
For us Kosovars, it has to be: "Kosovo je Srbija"
I'm English & I don't get the England one at all
What
Someone explain pls
Who does this
Why
It might've been deliberate
I'm sorry you get grouped in with us twats
nah most people know what it means, granted mainly because of the top gear episode
For instance, by omitting them from a map of Europe
by ~~declaring~~ reminding them that English cheese is better
Oh, I think that would only upset a minority of the country
Oh right, thanks
I've heard of the falklands, not sure why we're supposed to care though
> "You'd be speaking German if we hadn't won the war for you
Unless they're a russian they can shut their filthy hole
Also that thing about tea is just absurd
Nobody could possibly think that way
Don't encourage them it'll just get worse
> Britain could hold out indefinitely
Thats the part I'm not sure about
The germans got france and tried for britain but failed
They couldn't successfully invade but I don't know just how long  they could have held out for in a battle of attrition
I used to find it funny how my Finnish ex would have quite a varied pitch speaking English but in Finnish, it was a monotone deep voice (for a girl)

Happy B-Day Estonia
Now as a Brit idk much about Estonia so ive some question for any Estonian redditors reading
Can you sate my curiosity and tell me what its like in Estonia
* To any Estonians reading how would you describe your average Estonian person
, what do you think when you think of Estonian person
* I just wanna know what's the ordinary Estonian person's opinion of Estonia's past, present and above all future
Where do they see Estonia and humanity going in future
* What's the level of English speaking like in Estonia

, And what's the one thing you hate about the English language
* What does the Estonian school cirriculum consist of
What do you learn about
* I am also curious on how much do Estonian students learn about Britain
Do you learn about the British Empire, Industrial Revolution, The Middle Ages etc
and are basics beyond trading and wars covered, or do go more in-depth or is it just those two main topics
Just what do you learn about the UK
I was also wondering how do you view the UK and British people(and culture too)
, Do you like Brits
* When it comes to things like sex and porn here in the UK we're very prudish, awkward and puritanical, its a big taboo to openly discuss such matters, we like to pretend it doesnt exist etc
Well my question is what's it like in Estonia
Are you much more open about sex and porn
What's the Estonia's view of sex and porn
Is it like the UK
* Is Feminism a thing in Estonia
, And if feminism is a thing is it out of control like in Western Europe
* Are most Estonian men uncut or not
* What is the LGBT situation like in Estonia
, do they have rights
, Is LGBT and being gay accepted socially and cultrally
Just whats it like being gay or trans in Estonia
* What types of music are popular in Estonia
What do you Estonian guys & girls listen too
* What are race relations like in Estonia
* What are foreigner relations like in Estonia
* What are the police like
how good(or not) are the Estonian police
* What are Estonian unis like
how good(or not) are Estonian Universities
* What is the Estonian school system like
How good(or not) is the Estonian school system
* What is the healthcare system like
How good(or not) is the Estonian healthcare system
* What is Estonian TV like
how good(or not) is Estonian television
* What's it like living in an entire country yet with such a tiny population
Does it ever feel very limiting and too small in Estonia
* Lastly what is this "can into nordic" stuff about
What does it mean
, and where did it all originate from
Idk, but im no mi6 spy(why would you think that
im just a curious, inquisitive person is all
I like to ask questions, i just wanna know more about Estonia in this instance as the topic at hand as it were
Some northern English and Scottish dialects contain large amounts of Nordic words in their vocabulary
Bairn springs to mind
This is the type of post I love seeing in this sub

Mr Speaker I must register my dissatissfaction with the Right Honourable Member of Franconia for his use of what is, frankly, unparliamentary language
Mr Speaker, might I remind My Right Honourable Friend that our enemy is the Roman Empire not one another, such petty squabbling is not in the interests of this Parliament and we must focus
If my Right Honourable Gaul's grievance is over the incident with the rugby match then this was a simple misunderstanding
Speaker, I'd like it on Record that my constituents regard this motion as "A Big Oof". Thank you
Mr Speaker,
I wish to request an amendment to the amendment requested by the right honourable member of the German contingent
I put forward exchanging 'loveable idiots' to 'loveable eccentrics'.
Thank you kindly Mr Speaker
Mr Speaker, my esteemed friend the Right Honourable Member for Franconia will surely be aware of the lack of space in front of Westminister given by the inebrietated members of the public brawling outside by noon on any given work day
As a point of order Mr Speaker I move to suggest any witnesses to our duel would not be able to pick us out from the usual crowd
Really surprised at Switzerland being so low
I read this wrong and thought it said "English profanity", and was quite confused since Scandinavians usually seem so mild mannered, at least except for Finns
This is so surprising and yet it isn't. I thought that Norway would have a high proficiency but Sweden and Finland
Finland
They take that spot as well as house of orange (Dutch Bros who then tried to steal the English throne after the civil war
I'm surprised with Finland because all the Nordic countries meme them for not really being able to understand Finnish
The norwegians I know speak really english really well tbh
so shiocched
I went through a period where my mobile number was (I guess) being spoofed and used for spam calls or something in Italy
I got quite a lot of calls or texts from Italian people who understandably wanted to know what I was playing at, but I never spoke to one who even had a word of English
Obviously that's not a criticism, but it was a bit of a surprise as it's very easy to assume that most people in Europe have at least a smidgen of English
Bwahaha
Sciocched ai tel iu
Don’t go to England we’re the worst at our own language
Yeah they usually speak Italian, you know :D
Or maybe because we learn English to actually move abroad later so those who are left do not speak any other language beyond Italian

Everyone has parts of their culture mocked and it’s dangerous just to allow certain people to get a free pass
Thank you, mods
Why should we even have to apologise because of some braindead person, who, let's be honest, was not a Muslim and was only one by name
Sick and tired of this happening every so often now
We don't force normal American people to apologise for war crimes committed by their armies
We don't demand apologies from normal Beitish people for colonisation
I feel like with every day passing the hostility towards us in Europe and in America will only get worse, look at this sub for example
Look at Poland and Hungary, France and Germany now as well

I think Britain has been at war with or else had some kind of armed conflict with almost every nation that has been around for more than 70 years
I'm struggling to think of any forced takeovers (of/ by any nation) that hasn't caused suffering along the way
Power and greed are pretty awful human traits and it's only in recent history it's being checked, but even then you could argue that it's still going on, just with capitalism and cheque books rather than spears and guns
It's not genocide in my opinion as no direct action was taken to cause it
What Britain should have done is effectively temporarily seize control of the food supplies of Ireland and ration and redistribute
It's not genocide if it's caused by inaction (or too slow action, in this instance, as after a year measures were taken but this was too late) I don't think
It wasn't the British State exporting food
It was private companies owned by private individuals
i enjoy how you're incorrect about the british inventing capitalism, hand waving it as pedantry, and then stating that it's within their DNA, all within the same breath
We have this too in the UK
In March we had over a million on the streets of London against Brexit and we were dismissed as being 'paid protestors' with 'nothing better to do'. Even though the protest was on a Saturday
And of course the referendum is held up as the pinnacle of democracy, even though it was three years ago, there's evidence that it wasn't a free and fair ballot and there have been two changes of prime minister since then
If the PM can change because the ruling party changed their minds, why can't we have another say on Brexit

The EU has not been the cause for European peace
That would be NATO
NATO is a mutual defence pact that is making sure peace in Europe is maintained (with exception to Ukraine, which is not in the EU)
'Peace in Europe'. Definitely not NATO, and there definitely wasn't that series of wars in the 90s. Or do people there not count as European
Some of these aren't exclusively EUs policies though, for example the UK had an equal pay act in 1970
I hope this has reached the Queen this morning
More EU propaganda:
* Structural Funding
paid for by our own money
* Beaches and rivers
i'll agree with this, although most British rivers are not deemed safe to swim in
* Cleaner air
bullshit, the EU barelyy even fined German car manufactures for Dieslgate, even the USA fined them more, it's all about German profits
* Lead free petrol
eliminated worldwide in 2006
is the whole world inside the EU
no, nothing to do with the EU
* a recycling culture
hold on, this propaganda piece are claiming the EU is responsible for the recycling culture
seriously
* cheaper mobile charges - bullshit
Every single mobile phone provider in the UK has said when we leave the EU, we won't have EU roaming charges reinforced
So if you don't need the EU for it, how can you claim it's because of the EU
* Break up of monopolies
laughable
....i was going to go through all of the points on the propaganda poster
but they are laughable and its a waste of time
Very very few of these things can’t be achieved by a stand alone country
Madness to think that you need a dictatorship to get decent food labels
Are we not allowed to question the glory of the EU
Are we not allowed to change the EU for the better
Are not allowed to point at the negatives of the EU
To be fair i imagine 90% of people who voted brexit would be able to concede that the EU has some benefits
> Which wouldn't've happened unless there was an EU to make sure it did happen
Any evidence for that mate
> Because initially EU law made it happen
Before the law there were roaming charges
The law happened, then there were no roaming charges
But some companies already offered EU free roaming before the law, so they didn't make it happen at all
They made some change, but they never made it happen

The irony of all this, and I say this as somebody who has worked for Alstom and Siemens, Germany and France in a team-up could be a force for good in the world with nuclear energy if it wasn't for Germany's insane government and its refusal to treat its citizens like adults, sit them down and give them [the birds and the bees talk]
We binned our fission capability in favour of fusion, which will pay off eventually, but there's a 15-20 year gap that we need to fill and could have filled 30 years back with a state that is willing to deal with these issues
France has the reactor tech, Germany has the steam turbine tech (and used to have a very capable reactor industry), lets mash the two together and have fun
The big winner here will be France with low energy costs and carbon credits for days, and an export fission industry that is booming
Germany is going to be addicted to coal for decades (and it's only going to get worse with EVs), with skyrocketing wholesale energy costs because they're trying to backfill with wind power, and everybody else isn't going to have options
You're right about the UK but the potential for wind energy in the British Isles is enormous
Honestly I think enviromental groups's nuclear protests in the 20th century are the single biggest contribution to climate change
People say things like 'would you live near one
', I'd swim in the spent fuel pools its that safe
Not sure the whole environmentalist community doesn't support nuclear
Nuclear isn't renewable in the same way solar isn't renewable
The funny thing is you can use nuclear weapons in nuclear power in disarmament
So you can not only toss nuclear weapons, but you then make clean power from it
Nuclear power and disarmament go hand in hand almost
'its all fossil fuels' and nothing to do with picking to use fossil fuels in the first place
Didn't your green party basically emerge from the whole anti nuclear sentiment, its almost a perfect example of my comment
We could theoretically harvest uranium from seawater - its just a cost thing
Even then mining isn't a big deal on a global scale at all
Long term storage isn't a big deal, it just requires prior planning, also nuclear treatment is something thats advanced a lot
You're ultimately worried about the incredibly safe storage of nuclear waste, really don't get why
Most of it is low level or short lived intermediate waste than can be treated and burried, and the longer lived  stuff is generally left on site to decay before being deposited in geological vaults in incredibly safe containers
I'd argue in fact the waste produced by batteries, solar panels etc is far more hazardous than nuclear waste in terms of future prospects
Sorry about the Boris
Just Imagine

Estonia is not Northern European
Northern Europe - Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Netherlands, arguably Finland/ Germany / U.K. Estonia is very much Eastern European
That’s just the UN which has questionable definitions for loads of things
Socially the Baltic states are not even close to be seen as a Northern European country by like anyone in Western / Northern Europe, you guys are Eastern European, most people would agree
Why do you think otherwise lol
What has happened to our continent, why did this happen

Well that was certainly worth the loss of jobs, investment, funding, travel rights and trade

Wonder how Scotland can afford to give all those people free tuition fees
Yeah well jokes on you guys, you'll all be paying the same as us in a couple of years
And I'm sorry I know we suck
I was going to go to uni and I wanted to study history but I thought that going 20k into debt studying something I liked with little prospects from it would be a bad idea
People don't seem to understand the English fee system very well
Your poor background would have 0 effect on if you can go to university yet
I've got a load of student debt but haven't paid a penny of it yet because I don't earn over the threshold
Hell, it's actually easier to go to an English University because you only need to fund 3 years of living costs, not 4
Scotland fucking condemmed the rest of us to the Tories
Hell yeah ["the English higher education system which has, in just two decades, moved from a free college system to one in which tuition fees are among the highest in the world
Our findings suggest that England’s shift has resulted in increased funding per head, rising enrolments, and a narrowing of the participation gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students
In contrast to other systems with high tuition fees, the English system is distinct in that its income-contingent loan system keeps university free at the point of entry, and provides students with comparatively generous assistance for living expenses
We conclude that tuition fees, at least in the English case supported their goals of increasing quality, quantity, and equity in higher education
No one’s gonna pay that amount of money unless they’re fairly certain they’re gonna pass
Free market in action
Fuck Jamie Oliver
By in large part economically relying on their neighbors then blaming them for all of their problems
>the university owns basically most of downtown
Also true for Oxford - a college will usually own several properties, especially venues like clubs, bars, restaurants
If the college wants to create something new, they might close a venue and develop there
That's been my experience in Oxford: "Nuffield College ends lease of *club y* to make way for a new networking spot".
I believe if you lived in England for 3 years before you start university or you gained your entry qualifications (A Levels) in England then you pay English fees
Scotland is a stronghold for the left traditionally a safe 50ish seats usually for Labour (60 years of being the majority party) and a small chunk for the Lib Dems
The fact all of them now have given up on labour and no one down south will take a coalition with the SNP they fucked us all
More or less austerity will never end and the tories will be undisputed forever
It was the Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition who abolished tuition fees in Scotland
Nothing to do with the SNP
now that I think about it this is actually kinda accurate hahahaha
That's just flat out untrue
If you earn over £50k and aren’t paying back your loan surely you’re breaking the law
Make sure you enjoy those while you can, bailiffs will come knocking before long
Confessing to fraud on the internet isn’t usually the best idea
> Ask the bloody Tories what Brexit will entail, and they'll tell you about how strong and stable it will be
We don't have a clue
> Ask Labour what their position on Brexit will be, and they'll give you some wishy-washy thing about how much they care about people
Half my supporters are for, half against Brexit, so I'm saying nowt
> Ask the Greens about where the money will come from, and they'll try to cough it out
We think society dying in flames is more important than low taxes, you don't, so we're going to waffle until you leave
>  I was surprised by how British it is
So pompous and superficial
First of all, how dare you
Yay we are back in the EU

Not trying to be edgy or anything but after that video of the attack on that rally I'd be weary about such a large crowd, and all in a line too
Seriously I'd be feeling sketchy as owt

Now ive never seen a Hungarian male with a small cock
Hungarian men definitely put the hung into **HUNG**arian
Just sayin' ;)
Jesus you Slavs are a extremely horny bunch arent you
, Fucking like rabbits
:O.
Now why does Ireland have such a low number of pornstars yet the uk has a really high number
But i guess you could say that the Hungarians are hungary for hardcore sex~. Also from what ive seen Hungarian men sure do put the hung in Hungary
Czech porn is now literally it's own category
Yeah but they are just Sophie Dee videos
To be fair I knew 13 of them by name
Oh thank God someone posted another brexit cartoon

Luckily I knew I wouldn't have to wait too long till another one was posted
Such a refreshing perspective each one brings
What a completely clueless cartoon
Scotland is not 'chained' to Britain, it was part of Britain, and most Scots are proud of the fact their scientists, economists and soldiers went on to defend the Empire and share in the prosperity it brought with trade
Why would Skotlanti chain themselves to Britannia
Most Scots are proud Brits, and my point about the Empire is not to re-make it but to highlight that the Scottish have contributed to the Union in remarkable ways of which they are rightfully proud
I hear rumours that even Andy Murray has adopted the title of 'Brit', which is a remarkable achievement indeed
Meanwhile here in the UK our shitey parliament pulled shit like this so many times but none of them have been sacked
It's uncommon, but I think I might have heard it before, and I get the meaning straight away
'Do as I say, not as I do' is how it's said here
Here in the UK i have family members who are half white x half black(mostly Black British of Jamacian decent, decended from ppl who came here in the 1950s post-war immigration, from former Carribbean British Empire colonies) mixed race etc
I'd say in the cities
White x Black ppl its quite a common sight tbh
Nobody seems to care much
Lotsa tanned & i guess you could say milky coffee complexioned peeps walking around
They've become very much British first, most ive talked too seemingly view themselves as proudly British
Though despite whats claimed here tbh i cant see anyone being happy with a muslim relationship
The two cultures are simply incompatable for the majority
Wait, i thought we were meant to be racist or something

Perhaps I'm being unfair (and certainly generalizing) but one doesn't usually think of farmers as being socially progressive
It's encouraging to see in any case
Edit:  thanks for all the replies
The consensus here is that the farmers *generally* aren't doing this to support abortion but because they have their own grievances against the government, though some comments pointed out that farmers also have female family members and the extreme nature of the changes and u/lorarc recalled the history of abortion in Communist era Poland

But now im certain that day will never come
As i'd fear for my safety, as a homosexual i would not feel welcome or safe in Sweden, its got to that point and with the way things are going demographically its only going to get alot worse, waaaaay more violently homophobic and unsafe in the future
I know many other fellow homosexuals who feel the same way too

It’s ghastly, I’d be tutting beyond belief if I saw this crap on the train, then again I realise not everyone is as rich as us and can afford top quality CGI advertisement that reflects on how dominant our entertainment industry is and that’s due to how influential we are as a country, from Dunkirk to Batman to Sherlock to James Bond, and Spain looks like they’re stuck in the 1970s and gave some teenagers access to clip art to make an advert, what a disgrace

Remember when in your kitchen you had a drawer full of carrier bags and then one full of Nokia chargers
Remember when Nokia realised they were missing out on a lot of revenue from not selling replacement chargers (like Samsung for instance, who changed the charger head every two phones) so they changed the for the really delicate easy to break head
That's where Nokia f'd up IMO

As a homo i cannot talk about the Czech Republic without mentioning their world renowned, world beating gay porn industry

Dennis Reed died not long ago last year at the age of only 31 due to a motorbike accident :(, RIP you beautiful man
The Czech Republic lost one of their biggest stars and brightest lights that day
He maybe gone but Dennis you'll always live on in your many works)
But there's so many hotties in the land of the Bohemians and Moravians, how do you Czechs do it
, what's your secret
, I bet its something in the water ;D. No but one gets the impression that there's a strong sense of sexuality and eroticism to the place
The Czechs are a intensely sexual people despite their outward exterior
But i digress
Happy independence to all the Czech guys and girls out there:)
Prague is one beautiful city too
I was in classes of 30+ all the way through school in England
I tried to get my daughter into a school that had only 8 students per year, I also tried one that had 20 per year, she got into the one that had 28 per year bit that's ok, it's a good school I guess
From England, 25 kids in my class
9/10 for accuracy
26 seems low for the UK, it was always around 30 in my area
Also from the south
Our classes always had 30 people because it was a mix of two year groups
It wasn’t bad actually
We usually had a teaching assistant as well but I really don’t remember it being a problem for the teachers to control us
Maybe the people in my classes were just well behaved lol
We had about 17 so swings and roundabouts
In secondary school we had 70 people in a year and 3 different classes

Not much of a castle
I could take that with 20 good men
Good bit of info
I suppose what we have over here is "Stately homes" or "Palaces", but yes you're right, not an accurate word for the things that sit in between those and castles
We have manor houses in England, which sometimes had fortifications purely for aesthetics
Sometimes people incorrectly call them castles though

Bernie Sanders says he wants to copy Scandinavia/Germany/etc
Bernie Sanders proclaims himself as a "Democratic Socialist"
Bernie Sanders supporters and opponents see that "socialist" in the headline
Both his supporters and his opponents now assume that the countries he wants to copy are socialists, because he called himself one, and said he wants to be like them
Then you have organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America who also constantly use Scandinavia as the go-to country to emulate, which obviously leads to people thinking that Scandinavia is socialist (since the self proclaimed socialists always proclaim their desire to emulate them)
I don't understand why Sanders does this, he is literally sabotaging his own campaign and agenda by doing so
Even if he insists on the *Democratic* Socialist label, he is still (in the eyes of the American public) connecting himself to every other self proclaimed socialist government out there, including the failed states
I believe they also have the most Nobel Prizes per capita lol
> considering every American I know who is socialist, immediately talks about forced redistribution of wealth
Well, in a sense, they're not really wrong on that regard
Socialists do not want massive income inequality, and taxation to fund welfare programs and such *is* a forced redistribution of wealth for the betterment of overall society

> focuses on rehabilitation instead of punishment
I don't get where this meme that European prisons "don't punish" comes from
Being imprisoned is the punishment itself, just because the bed is soft and the shower has warm water doesn't mean that you aren't being punished
14 days of quarantine was bad enough in my own house
Multiple years of being imprisoned, even if the facilities are good, is fucking hell on earth
You're essentially living like a hamster
I know of the debate, but it seems to have gone off the rails a bit and now you see people going around the internet saying things like "European prisons are very humane & don't punish you" (which simply isn't true; [British & French prisons have been under scrutiny from Courts and NGOs for having abysmal facilities and being overcrowded] That's how we end up with ignorants claiming that Anders Breivik isn't being punished in prison
He is being punished by being in prison to begin with
All prisoners in Europe are punished in one way or another, the rehabilitation isn't voluntary, they "show up" for rehabilitation because the state used force to put them in there, and the state dictates how they live their lives for a set amount of years

The mail represents the interests of the corporatist elite to the lower middle and working classes
Its function is to sell values to its readers that further the interests of those elites
When Britain joined, the idea was it was joining a single market that would, though competition, generate a 'race to the bottom' in regulation and job security, so the mail trumpeted it as a patriotic win for Britain
However, the EU has developed into something that creates and enhances regulatory standards - hence it has become something to fight against
Just like the rest of the country, when we realised that Europe isn't the utopia that all you Europhiles paint it out to be, and that it is actually a stagnant, bureaucratic, highly centralised organisation that is hell-bent on diluting our own British Culture, our own British world presence, and the positioning of the greatest country in the world on the map, and the assertion of its own independence upon itself, instead of being tied down by the painfully liberal and painfully cloth-eared EU

And anyway the guy he killed was a Taliban fighter so in my opinion he deserved a fate worse than death
The only reason i can think of that the marine should be punished is because he didn't torture the dirty goat fucker first
It is very clear you only think the Mail is corrupt because you don't like their viewpoint
I'd be up for that if it meant I got a day off
> In the medium term it will probably be the financial industry leaving for europe
Everyone outside the financial industry seems to believe this
The reality is that it probably won't.  Some segments of it may, but there are huge parts of finance that are unaffected by Brexit
More importantly, there is so much concentration of talent here in London that sheer momentum keeps it here
New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong are also outside of the EU and they do fine as well
We're not going to stop immigrants from coming here to work in the NHS, no one has ever said this
I mean that isn't relevant at all
The Daily Mail quite clearly isn't a Nazi newspaper and it is factually incorrect to state otherwise
Then why does the British public think that their newspapers are to the right of them - and the furthest right (relative to the population) of any press in Europe
are you like 14 years old or something
>And without those luvvie EU labour laws we can pay them below minimum wage for being brown
What fun
What, the EU labour legislation that in most cases UK legislation goes further and beyond
And its been illegal to pay differently for different ethnic groups since like the 60's.
The paper has run award winning investigation pieces, being instrumental in the conviction of Stephen Lawrence's murderers as well as well as fighting for the release of UK Guantanamo detainee Shaker Aamer as well as exposes on the care home industry
But obviously you don't actually know about any of that because you've never actually read it
> Even if they don't leave entirely, they certainly won't be investing more in Britain in the long run
I don't think that's "certain".  Neither you, nor I, nor anyone knows what the long run looks like
> There will be very little reason to do so over the continent or Ireland
The UK is no more a part of the EU than France, or Germany, or Ireland is, and yet London has been the financial centre of choice in Europe, dwarfing Paris, Frankfurt, and Dublin
It's almost as though there are other reasons that the London financial sector thrives compared to other cities in the EU, reasons that will persist after the UK leaves the EU
>  **Literally no company** in City is talking about increasing their size or shares in City
I work in the City for an American fintech company and we are growing our London office faster than we are growing our offices in the US or anywhere else
The UK still has enough cultural power that people want to come here
The English language and British culture is a mighty thing
So thats a yes then
Which only exists due to EU law
That wouldn't be able to happen outside of the EU and is a key reason why areas such as Norfolk and Lincolnshire voted to leave, because unskilled workers couldn't compete
Of course its not certain, its just a very high likelyhood, you can't just say 'oh but you cant know that for sure', bullshit, when the rest of the world is saying that, believe them
And half reason London was the financial centre of europe is because it was the largest english speaking city in the EU, now it isn't.

>Daily reminder that the Brexiteers would have him gone
You really are a low information brainwashed drone
The UK is consistently found to be one of the least xenophobic and racist countries in Europe, far, far less so than any country east of Germany
What sort of dribbling moron would you have to be that "brexiteers would have him gone", as though the plan is to deport EU born people
Outrageous that you got downvote bombed for saying that
Actually laughable that some of the same people who call the British racist for voting for Brexit think it's fine to be openly racist against non-europeans as if they're superior
Right, and shall we highlight some racist anecdotes in Poland
I'm sure they'll be really tough to find eh
The statistics say that the UK is far, far less xenophobic than Eastern Europe
The fact you can read English and thus consume English news stories gives you the impression that the UK is some weird racist dump
Imagine the smell
Everyone's talking about correlation/causation fallacy and selective sampling, but am I the only one bothered by the fact that the y-axis starts from -5
I don’t know anyone that’s missing May
The left think Boris will get them an election, remainers a second referendum and hard core brexiters their no deal exit
All May got us was a deal that she couldn’t get anyone to agree to
We’ll see who is right, but I’ve not heard anyone lament Mays departure in the UK so far
Yeah, and in which of those is the higher education free
Because that’ll be the significant correlation
No wonder Scotland wanted no Brexit and England and Wales did
Can we legalise sterilising sex offenders pls & thank
Yeah if you think this isn't happening in every country in the world then you're properly naive
I was just thinking sex offenders in general, but the government won’t do that when they also have rapey boys in their cabinet
Repeat sex offenders would probably be the better candidate, I just was angry typing when I first made the comment
Repeat offenders are ignoring the human rights of others, I have limited sympathy for their rights to sexual reproduction (considering a lot of sex crimes are against family members)
No one lives there it's all jewelry shops now
Ah yes, let’s bring up WW2 era reasons for why Germany and Ireland get along, that doesn’t look bad on anyone
I wonder what made England and France unsure
Surely Germany had done nothing to warrant this and it was just the classic evil English doing evil things again
Whilst you think you may have been nice by advocating for reunification of one country, in this instance it would require the splintering of another
What happens to NI (and Scotland for that matter) is a matter for the UK and the UK alone to deal with
I wonder if you’re so quick to support separatist movements in your own country
Perhaps I should wish my good will towards the Bavarians
Yes the people of Northern Ireland who are part of the UK
I’m not trying to deny them their say if they want a referendum they should get one
The republic are entitled to some form of referendum on whether you would accept NI should they choose to leave (as if you’d need one) but unless NI votes to leave the UK then it isn’t anything to do with the ROI, and it’s certainly nothing to do with Germans or the EU
Keep downvoting me though, hurr durr England bad
I can’t be arsed quoting in my answer you’ll have to bear with me
Splintering of Germany was a direct result of WW2
Calling it a WW2 era matter is perfectly accurate
The people of NI chose to be part of the UK
For a long time (and for many still today) NI has been the strongest champion of the union
When the Irish Free State was created the territories of Northern Ireland were given a choice to opt out and stay as part of the UK
The northern Irish had a month to decide but elected to choose to rejoin the UK on the very first day with the northern Irish prime minister saying “we do not want the world to think we had a moments hesitation”.
We are not illegally occupying Northern Ireland
They very much want to be part of the uk, no one has treat them worse than the catholics
We’re lucky to have them and they’re lucky to have us
This is kind of shit that made me reply in the first place, everyone outside of the UK seems to assume that everyone in Northern Ireland hates the UK
This is completely not the case, and everyone should stop romanticising it as if it is the case
Even after Brexit NI STILL didn’t vote majority Sinn Féin
Also, seeing as you’ve criticised my education I’ll criticise yours
When I say NI is a UK matter, I’m speaking the truth, because NI is part of the UK
How does no one understand this
It is the decision of the UK government whether to grant an independence referendum and, just like we did with Scotland, if NI votes overwhelmingly in favour of independence parties I’m sure we’ll get one
Unlike the rest of Europe (particularly Spain) we do actually give our people the choice to decide their future
Everyone is mass downvoting but can’t wrap their head around the simple fact that you’re all advocating for the splintering of my country and somehow you think this is totally fine and justified
You wouldn’t say that about any other country in the world
The UK (which again I apparently have to reiterate includes Northern Ireland) will look after NI as it has done since 1922
If they want to leave they will be able to, but right now they don’t. Stop
Romanticising
Our
Separatist
Movements
Else I expect you to go harass the Spanish about the Catalans as well
Aye I obviously understand where the sentiment is coming from, I’m furious about Brexit/ Tories/ the general right-wing hellscape we’re turning into as well but unfortunately it’s my house so instead of shitting all over it I have to try clean up
Unfortunately others in the thread have just written me off as an English dickhead but I’m glad you seem to have understood things from our side, no other country in the world has its separatist movements romanticised by complete outsiders like ours are
If Scotland/ NI bail now the UK is essentially dead, and while a lot of people around the world would likely be happy about that due to what’s gone on in the past this is my country and I can’t just resign myself to watching it happen
There’s plenty of time for us to change, I doubt anyone would have predicted we’d be here in 2010 so who knows where we’ll be in 2030
You know how it's always said that world maps are really wrong when it comes to the scales of land masses, like how Africa should be much bigger and Europe and North Asia should be a lot skinnier or something, well how come the Ottomans were off as well, they weren't using fucking
satellites and shit, they were just trecking it down the sides of continents, surely they should've realised Africa was a bit bigger than that
OK, so let's say Mehmet the cartographer walks from Algeria to Cape Town, he walked over like a curve, and when that curve is put flat the curve isn't accounted for, just the flat distance, so the Continent can seem shorter
Something like that
I'm not really religious but line dancing is definitely a sin
>herd a bunch of rats
Strong language
I think we'll start to see more of this as the requirement for pan European nationalism grows in the EU
You can hardly call what may negotiated a deal
Ot was metaphorical anal rape
>Why would the EU make concessions against the interests of the people they represent
Because if they don't they guarantee the worst case scenario for a number of countries, particularly Ireland
That's just the harsh reality
You can say "but that's not fair", whatever, it doesn't matter
The EU put forward terms which no country in their right mind would ever accept
The UK had a democratic vote to leave and the EU are holding them to ransom for it - against the economic interests of their own people and the people of the UK
The only people it protects is the body of government that is the European Union itself
Personally I think it's scandalous - but entirely to be expected
It's really soured me to the EU and shows that they care about progressing their high-minded "project" more than caring for the people they represent
Mate Boris probably doesn't even know you poor sods exist up there
What's worrying me is that your government is calling for an indepence referendum (which is fair, you guys deserve it if you want it) but with a view to staying in the EU as an independent nation- ~~but I dont think you match their population minimum to join the EU yourselves, so you still wouldn't be able to
EDIT: Have now been educated on EU policy, thanks
This is key, the amount of grandstanding about what parliament doesn't want resulted in no possible solutions
No deal is the default regardless of how many times they vote against it
that's kind of the point of the deadline
>I probably should have used a different metaphor,
Absolutely
Many in Europe should be careful before referring to their opponents as vermin, given historical context
There's a reason every no-dealer with any influence is a fabulously wealthy stock-broker type
Well, that's a weight off my mind
More power to you
Cheers
And here's to Romany happy returns
Whats the literal translation of "la multi ani"? At/of many years
Mulțumesc
Never thought I would be this fine with brexit
Boiled meat
idk anyone who eats boiled meat
Its not like prehistoric times anymore(even back then i doubt boiled meat was common)
Your much more likely to get roasted meat here
And if its one thing we Brits have always done very well, one thing we're still world leaders in: Its roasted meat
Beautiful, wonderful, delicious roasted meat
We roast meat better than most and like no other nation Earth
We are world famous for it
Roasting meat is hard coded into our DNA
Brexiteers (crazy name, I know) don’t want a deal as much as you do
Yeah the "UK has shit food" is such an overdone and frankly completely incorrect insult
Pot calling kettle, mate
Let's take 1/6 of your wage of you and see how you feel
Banana split
I'd love to eat more Dutch food (only had a bit in Amsterdam) because being from a country that isn't a snob about other countries' cuisine I am always excited to try others
If you think food in Scotland is better than England then you really haven't traveled them much
No, it's more like 33
5 million folk, of which 16
1 million were happy to stay but are getting dragged away by the other 17
4 million
Scottish and Northern Irish people only represent 13% of those that are being dragged away
Thank fuck we voted Brexit then, can be doing with all these poncy EU regulations, lets go back to the good old days like wot it was when I was a kid, ham egg & chips for dinner every day washed down with a drink from the hose, can't do that nowadays with all this elf n safety
Wasn't eating none of that foreign muck either and when we found a bit of broken glass in our jar of pickled onions we never used to moan about it like the snowflakes these days, health and safety my arse, nothing wrong with swallowing a bit of broken glass and nothing wrong with a bit of salmonella either, back in my day wot before all these fancy EU names for things there was no salmonella, if you got sick from an egg thats wot your immune system was for
kids these days wouldn't know anything about that now would they
When I was a kid I used to paint all my Airfix models with lead paint, none of this regulated EU crap and it didn't do me no brain damage did it
Lets get Britain back to being British
Don't need no EU fatcats telling us what to do, we've got a special relationship with America, the more like them we can be the better frankly, let's aimt to live up to their standards of food safety and healthcare
Are all of my eggs gonna be poisonous after 2018
But getting whooped on 1812 means your our bitch again
Some people do but you don't need to, have you ever seen eggs in the fridge section of the supermarket
No, mine just has trays
Some do but I think that's just because they're usually made by American companies
Eggs last for like a month in the cupboard, why would you need them to last any longer
That is not what Salisbury Cathedral looks like
We use the lederhosen for Germans, swiss and Austrians here in England
Its recognized as an Alpine thing, but gets applied to all of Germany
Kinda like how everyone associates the entire UK with England
I think your thinking of /r/europe
Typical Dutch humour
I could tunnel underground and end up in the fucking Netherlands
OP is British
Oh yeah
Irl foreshadowing
Not strictly true
The first cars were made around the middle of the 18th century, but before the early 19th century they were steam powered
The first poduction car was the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, first built in 1885
No, I don't. As I said, the first production car was first built in the 19th century, probably should have specified that was internal combustion powered
Steam powered cars had existed prior to that
beginning of the end lol
it was long over by then
Man, look how relatively dark Scandinavia is
I live in a Swedish city so I don't see it, but sometimes I forget how small the populations are here outside the hubs
Replace all the “neutral” countries with “positive” and that’s basically my opinion
Surprised France is so high
The two things I’m most interested by:
a) the 50% +/- is exactly the Iron Curtain (except countries too small to register)
b) people on here seem to have a hard time believe that some people take the piss when answering YouGov polls
They never asked me
1% of people haven't heard of France :D
Which one of yall has a problem with Estonia
UK is too high our country is a mess
well, aren't they a theocratic oligarchy
that's not great, though it would be neutral for me cause they're smol and not hurting anyone
Of course we love you, why do you think we’re so reluctant to return Greek cultural artefacts of historic importance, we got that philhellene boner same as Byron
Do you wanna get out of here
I hear the East Indies are nice this time of year
Well the Romanian pickpockets and gypsies aren't really helping your reputation
Same reason you hate you
:-)
I wouldnt say political but rather their country hasn't got much to offer just a flat boring country with not much to do
Where sweden and Norway have alot more stuff that the uk doesnt so were more likely to visit and have a more positive reaction to such countries
definitely germany
While it is solid banter it should be higher though, our oldest friend, much love, we should write more
Albanians run a lot of gangs in London and haven’t assimilated at all so they get a lot of coverage in the news
I’m gonna be honest as insane an idea as it is, the idea we’re pulling America’s strings and are behind everything has a highly erotic appeal to me
I remember in Afghanistan the locals basically had a saying that was like “blame the English” and it was just said about any weird occurrence or bad thing that happened, icr exactly
> masters of evil, they control everywhere and every conflict, the puppeteers of America
I wish this were true :'(
Overall they come out as neutral
Maybe some people just chose to go hard with a negative opinion rather than admitting no opinion at all
Kinda weird that for a time a part of Croatia was part of the French Empire, is that ever brought up there, is it common knowledge
Europe would be a better place if we all paid more attention to Estonia
I've been a massive advocate of Estonia's digital citizenship platform since reading about it
Especially as somebody who keeps moving house and having to fill in and send off multiple pen and paper documents through the post each time
Estonia sometimes seems like an advanced utopia compared to the UK
What does it say about out education
Also you have to factor in trolling in surveys
It also depends on how the question is asked
Ireland is an island not a country
Hola
You don’t know how much hope I lost in humanity when everyone was praising Putin and calling him smart because he said “Great Thunburg Bad”.
Right
We played such good game the last couple hundred years they can’t believe we’ve actually become so grossly incompetent, it’s got to be planned
Our tory government decided to not make school meals free for children meanwhile they get £25 for meals on a £80,000 annual salary, and there is a clear north south divide
eh not really though
You’re the first Romanian I’ve ever spoken to who has a reasonable opinion of your country, then
Most Romanians I know are savagely critical of literally every government since Ceaușescu
And obviously they hated him too
Just to be completely clear in case it’s lost on anyone, British people do not actually dislike Scandinavians because of the Vikings
My guess is it’s just the sheer number of Brits who have trodden on Lego
Plus Sweden have ABBA and they’re are third largest religion
No not the pink map
One of the few instances of perfidious Albion actually being a thing
No that’s more to do with Sweden
who cares
Yes Ik I’m saying that this should be a thing that should be extended, I’d rather have money go to feed hungry kids than middle class MPs
Fair enough
Very admirable
And you’re right, of course, there’s lots to love about your beautiful country (particularly Sibiu for me)
That said, I’ve yet to hear good things about your government
Sounds like the whole thing needs a lot of reform
I don’t get it, and I’m british
No British people are going to leave for the continent over Brexit
Still a great country to live in, with or without the EU
This is why I love Europe
Just be aware that if you go an hour in any direction, people will sound completely different
You'd think Brits would be used to that but we don't know the true horror
I started learning Copenhagen Danish and then lived in Midtjylland
It was an experience
I just learnt to say "ikke" at the end of every other sentence, that usually worked
Ja, girlfriend taught me how to ikk' with the best of them
So Portuguese is just cockney English
Cool
This was the strangest thing I saw today :
Coal not dole
Germany should be getting huge fines for the emissions they cause
>You can even reserve a place in the queue using an app
blasphemy
Don't you dare try to steal queuing from us Brits
It's the best thing we've given to the world
Hahahaha ok
Text-based memes
Going back to our roots
I like it
It's not about the act, it's about the democratic mandate which the EU commission do not have
Parliament cannot introduce laws though
"I've chopped your bloody arm off
May is a remainer and doesn't believe in leaving the EU, nice try though
Lord Buckethead cannot be hurt by mere mortal weapons
Other than feed them, wash them, look after them, love them, be there for them, give them exercises, give them safety
I hate this meme
They wanted to move their capitals between their countries
Brit here
Lots of us didn't vote for this shit and we still hope it doesnt happen
Thanks, I actually needed this tbh
I am very anti-Brexit and still consider myself European and having to stay here arguing with everyone about everything is fucking exhausting honestly
This really brightened my day :)
In the end it's just politics and it makes me sad that a lot of people have conflated Brexit being about disagreeing with the government body that is the EU, with it being about disliking the PEOPLE of europe
Of course you guys will always be the best of friends to us
Never doubt that
Love you all
From a Brit who voted for Brexit
We are a sh*t show
I say welcome to the long 21st century my friend
If you think this problem is uniquely British, you're just mistaking us being first(second actually, after the USA) at at something again
Look at the country around you, do you think it will survive as well
The EU can will not really shield you from this
It is only an agreement between states
Prepare yourself for a tough decade
Help us
Everyone who doesn't want Brexit can't vote, and and the young people that can are massively outweighed by our huge elderly population that all vote Brexit and think they're doing us a solid
Honestly, I kinda wish you other countries could like
signa
Petition or something
Like yeah foreign powers shouldnt interfere with internal affairs, but I'm not 100% sure this is just an internal thing
Ah well
Probably wont be all that bad
I don't wanna leave, I been asking diffrent EU embassies for advice and it's comes down to "we can't do anything", leaving us going to fuck UK my future and kill alot of my job prospects, and with how our government is going we might need to take a hint from HK
Brexit is wearing us all down to our last nerve
Thanks for the kind words
Yawn
Agreed
>constant British dismissal of Ireland
You're an independent country lmao
I care about you Ireland
>Alot of us support the EU's line against our outrageous demands, and also support your stance on Ireland
And don't we know that remainers support all of the EUs demands over the UK, no matter what ️
>is willing to break the GFA
Could you be specific on which part of the GFA will be broken by the UK leaving the European Union
Here is the document:
Go ahead and tell me which clause specifically requires the backstop
>I don't know where you get this from
Remainers often tell us "no one in Europe cares, they have moved on, Britain is insignificant, Europa Uber Alles".
It's part of their routine of denigrating the UK to convince people we are too pathetic and insignificant to be independent
...what
>have Britain treat Ireland like a rebellious English province
No, you're being treated as a foreign country
Something that your ancestors fought to obtain and you constantly brag about
All of a sudden you want your own interests to be represented in Westminster
Ridiculous hypocrisy
Your interests are not the concern of Westminster any more
Your ancestors fought for that right
> Like why won't we just let them dictate everything while we just subserviently watch
This isn't happening
This is just a made up victim complex you've created
If you haven't noticed our new PM hasn't even bothered to meet Varadkar
If the UK was 'demanding Ireland fell in line' then we would have put some diplomatic pressure on them
Instead the Irish government is being effectively ignored
Welcome to sovereignty and independence
>we won't just go back on the backstop
Ireland was asked late in the hour if they would provide an independent exit mechanism separate from the EU in the backstop, and Tory MPs voted for this showing that if this amendment was obtained they would pass it
The Irish refused
Please tell your government to start taking responsibility for their actions as an independent nation
>The EU has remained reasonable and willing to engage at all times during the Brexit process
Meanwhile
Yes of course
Like I said we are aware you would support any demand the EU could possibly make
> Brexit tells the majority of Northern Ireland to go fuck itself
No it doesn't.
that's an implication on your part not mine
"I am anti-Brexit" and "I am European" are two separate statements
I'm not saying you have to be in the EU to be European
> Britain treat Ireland like a rebellious English province
Why are you concerned with this then
Ireland is independent and the UK is independent and the UK can act how it likes in accordance with international law
The Irish seem to want it both ways
Want to be able to be independent and gloat about separation from those evil English bastards, and also want those same evil bastards to take your considerations into account when making decisions on foreign policy
Very strange
Schrodinger's republicanism
Westminster is well aware
It's Ireland that is in a mess over how to blame the UK for the border the EU is going to force it to build
> The majority of N.Ireland voted remain
Brexit changes the status of N.Ireland
"The Status of Northern Ireland" as far as I read it in the document refers to Northern Ireland being part of the UK or part of Ireland
You seem to be interpreting that any legal change or foreign policy decision taken in Westminster would require a referendum in Northern Ireland
It seems that is a gross and deliberately ignorant interpretation of what "the Status of Northern Ireland" refers to
> All that matters is they're breaking the GFA
No sorry
They aren't.
The UK isn't going to build a border
We would only be "blaming you" if you were
What we are saying is your border is your problem
The UK can't stop you from building a border
We can only hold up our end of the deal
And who said Russians don't have a sense of humour
lol
Send us Brits some help
We and our country aren't built for this
For an island most our beaches suck and are ironically far away from most big cities, we don't have outside pools and we don't build with air conditioning but insulation
Its hot and humid and we're all bored and overheating
We'd never have left the EU if you made pools and air conditioning mandatory
I've had enough already
God I love summer
31c is fantastic
30 degrees and my car has no AC :)
Just had a wee peek at my weather map
Some crazy looking storms in Central/South France right now
I really need to get my visa for Iceland
The UK south was like 31 degrees was it not
Not south-east side
North-West England hotter than Portugal
The map doesn't look accurate to me
Plus there massive temperture differences all over the map right next to each other, 10c right next to 21c in Sweden for example
Can we swap places
Sweaty
Well yeah it does happen
Heathrow recorded 33
4 earlier which was hotter than Barbados
But its north Scotland
Tourism isnt what it useally is at the moment
Also even when I went there a couple years ago it wasn't that busy
I know this is r/Europe but you should stop falsely inflating numbers to push a narrative
Ya see the problem is we aren't really taught we need a second language, compared to all the other countries
I did GCSE french this year and tbh my french is worthy of a damn 10 year old french person
Is Ireland an anomaly
Eg did this survey (or its participants) categorise English as a foreign language, seeing as a lot of that age group would now learn at least some Irish at school, even though English is an official language of Ireland and arguably the vast majority learn it as their mother tongue
Why  is England so high
All jokes aside it very much is
Remove immigrants and their kids from the equation and that number will likely more than half
Amongst friends and colleagues the only people I know that can speak more than one language are from other places, so Hong Kong, Germany,Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia, Denmark, Norway, Iran, Czechia, Portugal, Venezuela, Spain etc
I think I’ve only met a handful of brits that speak another language, it’s much less than 30%
This sub is just a circle jerk at this point
Yeah that’s an exaggeration but I suppose that’s what cartoons do
Exactly
This subreddit is so bad when the posts are about the brexit situation
Can't we just go back to posting photos of old doors
not inside the EU they are not
what sort of independent nation cant control it's own waters or borders
No we cant, we tried to ban shark fishing in british waters, the EU refused to allow us to do it
which we couldnt
Not that we could catch more fish, that we could stop others fishing our waters and allow UK fishermen to do it, regenerating fishing villages all around the country
Assumptions are the mother of all fuck ups
Germanic peoples rise up
Ahh the uncentered flag
Oh no however will I manage to not anwser the phone to a number I don’t know
I live in the UK and I’ve never had a robocall in my life
Everyone else is saying they have one regularly
Is this weird
So the UK has deliberately overridden the E.U. laws to make it shitter
Twats
I hate this country sometimes
Well it's not working
I get them all the time
UK is in the EU last time I checked
Political elite don't want to
No thanks
yayyyyyyyy
Still a month and a bit of Summer to go and in my experience (no scientific basis), August is generally warmer than July here in the U.K., at least here up north
And only two records have been set for coldest in Europe since 2000
Obviously we still suck at measuring cold
Bloody idiots (not you)
Wtf I’ve been there
Made me wanna move to Germany tbh
/r/CrappyDesign
Millions of people will be exposed to how awful DDG is compared to Google, I’m as anti-Google dominance as anyone and really wish someone with very deep pockets and a passion for privacy would enter search (*cough* Apple)
Such a great day, it's shameful how many have forgotten about the horrors of the GDR
Mitterrand was more opposed to reunification than Thatcher was
I haven't felt this buzz in the air since mid-18th century Paris
> Everywhere in London
The people who get their news about the UK from Reddit and Twitter must have a really twisted view of what is going on here
This protest was confined to the Westminster area
The people supporting it support reversing the referendum by hook or by crook
They are not great defenders of democracy
They're just partisan players like the rest of us
I'm embarrassed at the comparisons to Poland or even to Hong Kong
Oh no
We agree my Polish friend
It won’t. People here just make funny signs and then go home
No it's not
Please get your news from places other than Twitter or Reddit
Lel won't happen
I disagree
Canada has a virtually identical system (including non elected "Lords", or Senators in Canada) and they're doing fine
The current status of the UK is the fault of the British electorate
We have made stupid decisions, been apathetic about our representatives, voted for incompetent people and continued to do so for decades
It seems everywhere on this website everything is blamed on "the system", including in other countries like the US, but when are we going to acknowledge that sometimes the system actually works and that the electorate are to blame
Brexit was a popular vote, not the MPs fault
It was one of the few cases of direct democracy we get here and we used that chance to derail the train
If the average Briton did a 15 minute Google research before voting, everything would be considerably smoother and better
This is the fault of the people being lazy twits who get their information passively from ads displayed on the bus
The UK's constitution was not at all designed to govern an empire, it literally precedes the "vast empire" by 2 centuries (everyone forgets the British "empire" was a tiny thing, mad even tinier by the loss of the USA, before the mid 1800s)
Canada has actually been quite successful with an almost carbon copy model of the UK, the biggest difference being that they adopted proper federalism as opposed to centralized
*head of government, the monarch is the head of state
Longest in the UK's history
Second longest in England's history
I can state with 100% certainty there will not be 'riots'
Me neither
However, we've had 2 Charles' before, the first one caused the civil war
The second one brought back Christmas and stuff after Cromwell banned it and put in lots of other Puritanical laws
You better go quick
UK is leaving interrail at the end of 2019
(Not a joke)
Thanks
Thought we would be leaving
Dude I was about to be so mad
What the fuck is going on
Like if that was real, why are we cutting ties with our closest allies, god I fucking hate old people and i couldn’t care less about this ‘anglosphere’ people love talking about, let’s just hope we get another vote
a threatening bus
Ahhh another EU directive, I wonder how long this one is
The one on cabbages was originally over 26,000 words long
about the same length as George Orwells Animal Farm
Surely this will be Lord of the Rings length
But I thought europe didn't force laws on anyone
It's just a monetary and economic union
that's what we all signed up for
originally right
>At least the Tories will hopefully get what's coming
[B R E X I T  M E A N S  B R E X I T]
Also it was a spike in reported hate crimes rather than hate crimes so it may have been immigration/xenophobia coming to the forefront and being more widely reported on leading to people reporting issues more
To be fair to the British, there isn't really a natural second language to learn here (unless you're speaking about Welsh / gaelic) as English is the universal second language
How does this take into account joblessness, i.e does it mean the person earns 0 or is it not taken into the average
Does anyone have any figures for GDP per capita / average salary for just England
I would be curious to see the difference W I S make (I assume all 3 would reduce the average figures
I so want to move to Iceland right now
Just call me Mr Average
What’re they independent from exactly
Do you know where to find more of these
Thanks
That’s definitely something worth celebrating ~
Thank you
I recognise those cranes from when I was there 10 years ago
Wonder if the public can still use the extremely narrow staircases
There’s so many atrocities we’ve committed across the world but one that comes to mind rn is the concentration camps in South Africa which killed over 26 thousand women and children
I don’t know how unknown this is but Alan Turing who helped to break Nazis’ enigma code was arrested for being gay and was chemically castrated by the government he helped years ago
He was banned from GCHQ and the US which greatly effected his career
He killed himself in 1954
Same thing happened both naturally and unnaturally in the UK
We also tested nuclear weapons in the Australian outback in the 50s. We didn't make any real effort to warn the Aboriginal people and a lot of them died
We also tested the effects of nuclear weapons  on our own soldiers
We'll set up a camp and put our atrocities in it
Oh, wait
There isn't a corner of the earth where the population haven't been enslaved at some point
Yes they are the only ones
smh
Again, you clearly dont knowabout how many ķìù existed on this island

Now everyone who thinks Gibraltar is an island is actually right
Dutch hater
Pretty sure you mean East East Anglia
Thanks
Oh, I read European and Russia is partly in Europe, I’ll pick France then
But it’s way too small
Sorry gotta be france
Hands across the sea
Lucky bastard
Enjoy :D
So you are working to limit freedom of expression
Very progressive
As it should be
Wish we did that in the UK
We do that in the UK, up to 25 I think
And anyone in a vulnerable situation can collect them, like homeless and addicts and such
Why
Do people still say quid and pounds in Ireland
Whenever I go on holiday with my mrs no matter what re money is
It’s pounds in her mind
Same thing isn’t it
I obviously agree with you that it happened
And that’s my point
There is no law in the UK and no sane person is going round spouting that shite
I think it’s better to just debate and explain how retarded they are, Sunlight is the best bleach, instead of limiting free speech
From what I understand it was decriminalised because the Bolsheviks repealed the entire Tsarist criminal code, including the part about homosexuality
It wasn't specifically targeted
I agree
The UK definitely limits freedom of speech too
That doesn’t change what I said though
We don’t live in the Weimar Republic
It’s working pretty well everywhere else
You really think that if that law disappears then everyone will become a raging nazi
It doesn’t matter if one nazi doesn’t listen or debate, it matters that the public as a whole can see that the Nazi is wrong
Also you say it yourself if so one cantr accept the mountains of info we have about the holocaust then they are clearly idiots and insane and not worthy of being listened to
You aren’t genuinely comparing that to hitler r are you
I don’t think I can carry on a conversation with someone who thinks brexit voters are extremists
Well fuck
I think we're totally fucked
There were no good options, but Boris Johnson was the worst
Unsurprised despair
One of the things that I find most vile about this entire Brexit shitstorm is that the official name of the Conservative Party is actually the Conservative and Unionist Party, and it's [recently emerged] that most Tories would rather see Scotland and Northern Ireland leave than Brexit not happen
They're just awful
Awful
I can't see why so many pricks keep voting for them
I'm not even a big fan of Jeremy Corbyn but I'd much rather have him as prime minister than practically *any* Tory
I despair
I genuinely despair
I'm watching the disintegration of my country as I know it
The tiny lump of patriotism to which I'm still clinging is shrinking by the day
I wouldn't wish this on anyone
> "The essential English leadership secret does not depend on particular intelligence
Rather, it depends on a remarkably stupid thick-headedness
The English follow the principle that when one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it
They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous

Joseph Goebbels
You mean as an *independence supporting* Scot you're low-key happy
Not all Scots will be happy, especially those that want to remain
I myself am not happy because he's a twat and wants us to leave the EU without a deal
I want us to remain
Who want to storm parliament, they can‘t stop all of us
I don’t think it changes much
Johnson is incompetent and opportunistic but I think the comparisons to trump are unfair in that he doesn’t have the prickliness or tendency to do genuinely regressive things out of spite alone
He’ll probably embarrass himself (and by extension the country) a lot on the global stage but equally he has more charisma and more support among his party and voters than may, so I’ll be interested to see his strategy for Brexit
Ultimately though whether he or hunt won we’re still in the same position
The EU won’t budge on the terms of the deal, and there is no majority in parliament for anyway out of the current status quo (2nd ref/no Brexit, the current deal, or no deal) none of the options have enough support to pass and any attempt by the government to force them through was taken off the table by the vote to prevent pro-roguing or overriding parliament
So I would suspect that whatever boris tries to do either he or Parliament will be forced to avoid no-deal and seek another extension when the deadline comes up in October
I reckon it will be more interesting than habing Theresa May
Can I emigrate yet
FuckFuck Fuck  Fuck   Fuck    Fuck     Fuck      FUCK
Honestly Brexit is a mess and there’s not much anyone can do at this point BUT there is a small chance that by being loud SOMETHING will happen, whether it be a deal, no deal, or even no Brexit
I voted Labor
Boris Johnson will usher in a new golden age of prosperity, of peace, togetherness & understanding, of Britain rising to be even stronger etc
Boris Johnson will usher in, herald a golden age the likes of which has never been seen on this island before
He's just another limp-wristed David Cameron, who is a supporter of mass immigration and multiculturalism
I don’t care, but I’m sick of all the abuse by remainers
I just hope the UK leaves soon
I hope Boris can do it
I don’t believe the EU, I don’t think it’s a democratic institution, I don’t think it’s a bag of great things, I don’t think it’s gonna last and I believe change is healthier than stagnation
If it backfires, at least we can say we tried
If it doesn’t, it will be good
Anyway, instability is inevitable, and insulting people and acting as if we were drowning immigrants in the Thames won’t make life easier or solve anything
So let’s get out and see what happens
Boris will be criticised whether he does a good job or not
If he leaves, another will take his place and half the country will be unhappy
Doesn’t make any difference, so let’s be done with this
We don't deserve anyone's sympathy
We did this to ourselves
Hunt is worse
Most Tory members, not voters - important distinction though
We didn't actually vote for Boris Johnson
Only Conservative Party members got to vote
Um I'd say both
I do dislike Hunt and he's certainly not ideal but I think he would make a much more reasonable, competent and capable Prime Minister
I'd much prefer him over Boris Johnson (but then again that's not a very high bar)
Nope, it'll be "we could have had our unicorns if it weren't for the evil EuSSR punishing us for leaving, god bless good old Boris, man of the people".
I mean I’m deffo part of that group
Marched against this bullshit
Twice
Yep
That's just how it is
I'm not complaining though, just pointing out that the public didn't vote for Boris Johnson
We did vote for Brexit yeah, but I think it's unfair to say that the people voted for Johnson (+ likely incoming no-deal Brexit) simply because a chain of events led to this
And besides, there's still the half of the population that *didn't* vote for Brexit and have to live with the outcome too
Theresa "I'm willing to get rid of human rights to catch terrorists" May
As much as I hate her though, I *still* pity her a bit: she was put in an unworkable situation, with no "correct" solution
We don't have bruh moments here, we just blame it on the french

Actually the Charge of the Light Brigade was a success, because we won the Battle of Balaclava, but it was just with higher losses than would have otherwise been the case

You need to click the country you're from and then "apply"
I cant imagine being so fluent in another language That this would ever become a problem
I'm English and have lived in mainland Europe for 5 years, I speak basic English so much with non-native English speakers that I've definitely got worse at speaking it at a decent level
As a native English speaker the numbers used to throw me off when learning German
I mean, I do
I’m from Nottingham in the East Midlands of English
To me, it’s a very recognisable accent especially since I live in London with my brother and another East Midlander; our flat is a little oasis of East Midlands English
And yet, it is an accent that basically no one has heard of, even amongst English people, and is barely ever represented in TV and certainly not in films
My boyfriend is Northern Irish and I love his accent
He doesn’t really care about what I sound like and actually dislikes when I really lean into it
So yeah
it’s an accent I really like to hear despite being so unknown, and frankly ignored
I have been called ‘Southern’ by Northerners and l’m _constantly_ being called ‘Northern’ by Southerners
It’s infuriating
I’m from the fucking Midlands
Sometimes when I'm watching YouTube and the guy/girl whose channel it is if they're a non-native English speaker(usually it's either Norwegians/Swedes/Danes/Dutch) yet their respective accents are so neautral/English/American sounding, their English is so good and natural that they sound near enough 100% like a born native speaker, like it's to the point that if you didn't know they were non-native you'd never of known they were
I think they can easily fool a native English speaker
It's quite the surprise finding out they're actually not English, sometimes it's given away by how they pronounce the odd word, but it's literally like a single word
Their mastery of English is something else
But regarding my accent, I've a very mild West Country/Bristolian accent, think Samwise Hanger but much milder, think the Witcher 3's area of Velen with all the peasants and their West Country/Bristolian accents, mines very similar to that
but again much, much milder more of a very slight twang instead of a accent, nothing to full on or thick
Personally I don't mind thick accents
I feel like they tell a story of a person's origin and or where they've been
A life story of sorts
I certainly don't make fun of anybody's accent
I mean that's very rude and counterproductive when it comes to trying to understand somebody
It's not my jam
My accent varies
Born and raised in Nottingham but people mistake me that i'm southern (particularly from Surrey) because I don't speak like everyone else around here
Not sure why
It comes out when I'm arguing or drunk though
I think it's a decent accent
I like the Polish accent, I think certain Poles have a nice cadence, and the accent has a nice flow, infact here's my favourite Polish accent
It's nothing to be ashamed about imo
My favourite Italian accent, it has great sing songy flow imo, really adds to the subject matter in the videos too, not off-putting at all
Foreign accents sound better than some of our native ones
Don't be ashamed guys, its amazing you even know a second language
I've seen this from many Germans who are like ashamed of their accent or that they dont know an unusual word or perhaps they pronounce something slightly wrong and then act like they've embarrassed their entire family and are a sham of a person
Guys, its cool
As much as we will take the piss out of you barking orders at us when saying hello we actually quite like your accents and your English is often better than ours as we reduce our language down to colloquialism
Love the German accent idk why
Mate, I’m English
The English language originates from my country and Hollywood _still_ likes to makes English people out to be baddies and villains
As the risk of sounding like a snobby European, the way our accents are portrayed in big films and TV says less about us and more about Americans
My favourite Greek accent(  ), he has a nice cadence to his voice
I think most English people like french accents or are neutral about them
We don't really care about accents because, since English is kind of an international language, we're very used to hearing non-native speakers
And even within our own country we have a huge variety of accents so we're used to other accents in general
That’s funny
unless it’s a truly ridiculous comedy accent, the French accent is often thought of as being quite sexy and sophisticated in a lot of English speaking countries
My favourite Italian accent
That's what Kimi Raikonen sounds like
In comparison though Valtteri Bottas hardly has a Finnish accent at all
Like it's so neautral and not far off native sounding(like it's not identical but it's really not hugely far away) that you wouldn't know Valtteri was Finnish, European yes but not Finnish) you wouldn't think Raikonen and Bottas are from the same country going by how they speak, but they are
I'm guessing it's a generational thing
Older Fins having the thicker more pronounced accent compared to younger Fins who are more accustomed to speaking English
Sorry but Dutch English speakers very very very very very very much have a distinctive accent to us
I find it very hard to believe that your accent is totally neutral
Please dont take this as an insult - The dutch English accent is super endearing
TBF depending on the accent would've and 'Would of' do sound pretty much the same
Are you aware of any accents that we don't make fun of
Ah, Der Kommissar Oettinger
I think of the Puss In Boots(from the Shrek series) when i think of the classic Spanish accent
Its such a sexy, epic accent
It has such a nice flow, candence and sound to it
Just so yummy
My point is that we make fun of all accents
I did not know that, thanks for the info
I'll say it's a shame they couldn't of gone with Antonio's true accent then, gone with a more natural, less forced and less thick stereotypical Andalusian Spanish accent
That'd of been nice to hear
But I guess in a fantasy animation everything has to be turned up to 11
It's like Japanese anime, nobody actually talks like that irl but it's all for dramatic effect, it has to captivate people and be larger than life
And in that aspect Antonio Banderas nailed it
I lived in Portugal for a couple years, and honestly I wouldn't have dreamed of judging anyone that could speak two languages where I could only speak one (Even after trying my best to pick up Portuguese (It's such a difficult language
Frankly, I was just grateful that they chose to speak to me in my language at all
Besides, if anything, I always thought the Portuguese -> English accent was always rather pleasant
Fair enough
I still hold that I feel grateful that it's my language people are willing to speak, and those that have managed fluency in two or more are amazing to me
Most teenagers in the UK have Iphones
I’d say about 80% have iphones and the rest of people have androids and google pixels
I think with adults, the ratio is around 60/40 with most having iphones
I switched from Iphone to Google Pixel because Iphones are hugely overpriced
I think the new SE might be a decent option though
I pay something like £25 a month which included a free chrombook, Pixel3A and like 12gb of data, unlimited calls/text etc etc
If I didnt get the phone included it would be like £10 a month
Also the Iphone makes you look pretty basic TBH
Like i'd expect a 17 year old girl to have an Iphone because some singer they idolise also has one
It's 52% iPhone and 48% Android in the UK, according to the site OP posted
Right on the age group thing though imo, in the US, Android's are seen as cheap phones for kids etc and Apple are used for work, not the case in the UK at all
Not really true
The entire UK civil service issues iPhones for work use
That just isn't true, I used to work for the MoD in the civil service and they issued Android phones
They issued iPhones in the Home Office in 2018
I may have been slightly off to assume it applied to,all
Slough, gravesend, Oldham, Scunthorpe, Grimsby, skengness maybe, brum, Blackpool, Luton, a lot of Lincolnshire and around there tbf
just read the names of the first few and that will give an idea of how it is there
Milton Keynes
Theres no highstreet or cosy centre
The layout and housing designs tend mostly to be ugly and very 60/70s style of houses
not seeing enough shame for Swindon here
a dreary place that is a volatile mix of heavy South Asian immigration and some seriously, seriously racist people
lot's of violence, poverty and crime
not a pleasant place at all
Ooooh slough
My kinda town,
I don’t know how
Anyone could put you down
-David Brent
Same with London tbf
If they’re think that’s ugly they should see shitty London
When I first heard about somewhere called "Wolfsburg" I imagined some medieval city on top of a hill surrounded by leagues of dark forest
Guessing it's not that
Where does Volendam rank on the incest scale
Honestly, Birmingham is getting better
The city centre is almost nice now, with the library, the Bullring, and the pedestrianised area in the centre
There are even trams now
The suburbs are still often rather bleak, but parts of the city are alright
I went to Malmö on holiday once and found it to be a very quiet, sleepy town
Was only there for a few days but that was my impression
Yet I constantly hear Swedes talk about it like it’s New York in the 80s without all the good shit
Also home to many of the UKs biggest recent Islamic terrorists
Hard to be ashamed of Coventry, it's more depressing because it was once one of our finest preserved medieval cities before it was bombed by the Nazis
I think I've read claims that it was the most preserved city in all of Europe
If you’re getting a train to Windsor, you’d have to change at Slough (the branch line to Windsor diverges there)
It’s further out then Heathrow though, you wouldn’t pass it on the way there
I wouldn't say it's like the North
Its a distinctly southern type of grimness
A middle of the road London commuter Town, with no distinguishing features
Its not grim, or run down or does it display any of the post industrial grimness associated with the worst parts of the North
Its just a place that dreams go to die
Leeds isn't terrible, it's at least got a much better economy, more vibrant suburbs and a stronger sense of community than the surrounding towns and cities
Of all the major places in urban Yorkshire it's far from the worst
Bradford, Keighley, Dewsbury, Huddersfield, Rotherham are all far worse
Source: Live in Keighley, have been through surrounding area, Leeds is far better than the rest
Wow, that’s more than three times as many as London’s 2019 murder rate of 1
5 per 100,000 people
Because we went to Copenhagan and thought we’d just cross the bridge to Sweden
Home to most of the UKs terrorists
My vote would go to Birmingham
It was once one of our most economically and scientifically active cities but would turn into the grey and brutalist city that it's stereotyped as during the post-war period and government deliberately sought to reduce its population
Though it's looking up right now, it's still quite behind its natural place in the country
It’s all about personal preference really
The line from Slough is pretty cool though, because there’s a great view of the castle if you go that way
Wigan has soul
The UK’s was 1
2 in 2017
Just slightly less murder-y than us
Slough station is literally the best thing about Slough though
nice buildings, and you get to watch the trains whooshing past (which can be rather fun)
I love living in London and knowing I can always fall back on “Sorry I was underground”
Not really the topic, but I was late to a lecture once because the train stopped due to ‘excessive snow fall’ that clogged the air horn
Sounds fake, but it actually happened
I really needed to tell that story, so thanks for reading this

But he has made up his mind, and since he knows that if he turns back on this decision he will never be able to make any important decision again
I'm english and literally just learnt from another comment in this thread that were meant to use flat, not apartment, so yes
What about American words (you know, the stereotypical ones like couch, sidewalk, pants (for trousers), gas (for petrol), vacation, candy, etc
etc
And what about accent
For example how do you pronounce the short O sound like in [not] Or do you pronounce your word-final Rs
Is it all British
Or is there some American in there
Also by the way, -ize spellings are considered acceptable in British English too
-ise is more common but both are used, whereas in America only -ize is used
Thanks for responding
So I suppose it is a little bit of a mix
> The American sounds entirely too much like an A to me
Ditto haha
That's exactly how it comes across to me 'naaat'.
> "We arr going to speak to the professorr"
Haha, writing it out like that looks like a West Country accent to me, who are also known for their Rs
> For instance, I say "sofa" and "coriander" instead of "couch" and "cilantro",
Cilantro
That's a new one
I never knew Americans didn't say coriander before
But yeah that is an odd case
You've got it backwards to most people I've encountered who (at least try to) use British spelling and terminology, but have a distinctly American influenced accent
That makes sense really, and I can't say I'm surprised with the accent; that seems to very often be the case
I just wondered because I often see people say on r/AskEurope that they use British English and then go on to just talk about British spelling, and I was curious whether they use British terms and pronunciation too
I think I get what you mean
My French is pretty shit but I sometimes try to do something like that, for example I try to force myself to say *semblable* rather than *similaire* more often simply because otherwise I feel like I am simply Frenchifying English words rather actually knowing the French word
>> sidewalk
> what even is the british version of that
Pavement (although personally I would tend to just say path)
Sidewalk sounds *really* weird and literal to our ears
>> candy
> not using sweets
Any reason why
Gasp
We have a convert
You, my good sir, have brought a tear to my eye
I shall brew some tea in your honour
Eh the differences are pretty minimal and English spelling as a whole is pretty complicated
I don't think it's enough to make any real difference to how simple spelling is
Yeah, it's definitely not as clear cut as American = rhotic, British = non-rhotic
There are traditionally non-rhotic American accents (that you mention), and traditionally rhotic British accents (mostly Scotland and the West Country I think)
But I think it's still a pretty good distinction here as most English language learners are taught either something close to General American (which *is* rhotic) or something close to Recieved Pronunciation (which *isn't*)
> For example, the culture of the rural deep south is rooted in the border wars between England and Scotland
Interesting
That's something I've never heard about before
I might have to take a look at that book
Fair
I just wondered if there was some reason you disliked the word or something, since for the others you just said what you do use but for candy/sweets you said that you won't use sweets
I was reading into it too much
Don't worry
Very well put
Think I've got some in the cupboard
Have you ever tried Lady Grey
Took a sec, I had stuff to do, but cheers for being on the right side of the English language

Not weaker but more of an orange bergamot flavour

Said it before, and I’ll say it again
The gaps in toilet stalls
I’d heard of them before I visited but they still shocked me
Literally like 2cm of space between the partitions, for literally zero reason at all
People can look right into the stall
Goodbye privacy
Why
Whyyyyyy
Baffling
My aunt and uncle live in the States and we would often meet their friends
One of them had a daughter my age (I was 9 at the time) and she ended up taking me to her softball practice (looking back I’ve no clue why)
The girls on her team looked at me like I was a bloody neon unicorn and when I tried to politely ask one of them for a piece of gum (she had a massive bucket and was sharing them) she barked “WHAT
” at me
That was the moment I realised that being at least somewhat polite to strangers even if their presence confuses you is not a universal thing
I wasn’t upset just a bit shocked and intrigued
Almost everyone drives a massive SUV
It was almost obscene
Also, flags
Flags everywhere
Really
Never knew that
That is quite interesting
The norwegian culture is very opposite and it must be a weird experience
My comment was about the toilet gaps
Insane
> I witnessed a mother opening several packs of sugar and sprinkle it in their kids Coca Cola
I’m still speechless
Honestly, this sound crazy but I actually find that more gross than 99% of the stuff you see in the weird sureddits
I think because I can jut imagine them doing that all the time like it was normal and its so upsetting
If anyone said something like that about my dick I’d zip right back up and bounce
Their loss
I remember counting exact change and then the guy on the till after having given my order, saying it costed more
I was very confused and wasn’t even sure I had enough money, so now a social nightmare of a situation commenced
Can I cancel my order, what do I do
I look through my change to see, the guy starring at me
I start to panic, I try to find more money
Its not there
He then spots this weird looking coin, which I had thought were worth 5 cent or something
But no, this coin had the apparent value of like 25 cent
Why isn’t the currency labelled with the number on
Its all resolved, but leaving it brought the question, how the hell are you meant to get exact without using calculators
Lol
Just to highlight how different it is; I've been made uncomfortable by the friendliness in NYC
Then
change them
You have the power
You sweetheart
Thanks for your kindness
I’m a woman and this happened more than a decade ago, I’ve gone back to the States many times since then and met some of the friendliest people ever
Especially in NYC, I don’t know where the stereotype that New Yorkers are unfriendly comes from
It obviously *isnt* rude as its their country and their culture
But one cant help but feel weird if you're not at all used to it
Yeah but are we talking about all adults or just teachers here
I visited NY a year or so ago and was amazed how friendly everyone was
I’d heard of the New York thing but was pleasantly surprised, much friendlier than London and certainly friendlier than Paris (God, never again)
I can't believe any human could actually fit that thing in their stomach
A loaf of bread over there won’t go bad after a month
There’s so many preservatives in it
See I live in London so thats normal for me an I have zero problems in Paris

The reason the EU gives the US Visa free access is because it's beneficial to the EU
I'm not sure what planet some of you are living on where you think this is some great act of philanthropy from the EU
They aren't doing them a favour
Many countries do not have reciprocal visa arrangements
I think the EU should disband
>I think it’s more complicated then it seems at first
"No
I want to jingoistically criticise the US and talk up sanctions and actions to make Europa feel strong
How Europhiles can't see this dangerous creep of Nationalism coming from their own mouths is quite frightening
Because we are detached from the Pan European Nationalism acceleration we've seen in Europe in the past 5 years and are able to see the wood from the trees
Trump is a buffoon, and will be gone next year
Brexit is the UK leaving a union its public was never really invested in further than economics
The UK and The US are not your enemy
It's not national socialism, you're arguing a straw man there
It's nationalism in the traditional sense, painting an enemy in order to create national (or in this case pan national) cohesion in order justify further integration
Vilifying anyone who wishes to leave
Europe should know this is a dangerous path
I wasn't saying thats what you were saying
I was saying people don't want to hear the logical reason why the EU offer what they offer and vice versa, they want a reason to rally against the US
Pan European Nationalism has now shifted it's reliance on an enemy (as all nationalism requires) from Russia to the Anglosphere
Brexit and Trump gave them the perfect ammunition to affirm and act on their underlying biases that have existed since the early 20th century
The economic benefits were not worth the political cost to many
It seems money is everything for some but not for all
The British public has never really felt part of "the family" in my opinion, rightly or wrongly
If not for the economic benefits of the Single Market (or the economic threat of leaving it), I feel the leave vote would have been comfortably over 60%.
There are very very few pro EU integration British in my experience
Most remainers only support remain because they think leaving is economic suicide
I feel as though some form of brexit was inevitable although I felt soft brexit was always more likely, but people pushing to cancel brexit polarised the debate (IMHO)
I would expect the brains of European's to not be entirely 1984d and remember further back than the last 5 years and look further ahead than 5 years
If you think the US and The UK are your enemy you are a victim of propaganda, the same way as if a British leave voter thinks Europe is their enemy
>Well that’s fine then - but why is it a problem then for you that the EU will now give those benefits only to member states and exclude the UK from them ?
>Cause I guess that’s what you mean with the claim That the EU is behaving nationalistic
Not what I meant at all
More the rhetoric seen from European politicians, public and media
Very hostile language and in some cases such as labelling Gibraltar a colony, actions
Considering you are a European who interacts with London based metropolitan youngsters, I'm not surprised you've never met a brexit voter
If you had they would likely be firmly in the closet about it
90% of our country does not reside in London remember
I'd also like to note that this passion for the EU is a recent invention spawning directly from the referendum result
This whole wrapping yourself in the yellow and blue flag shit didn't really exist here before the vote
It's developed as a kind of a weird pro status quo counterculture
>Do you fear European retribution for Brexit
I feel as though Europe is going to repeat the same mistakes of old
I don't trust the people who constantly end up in positions of power in the EU (La Garde, der Leyen, Juncker, Vehofsdadt) tot take it to a position which represents the demos of Europe
>Telling you that you won’t get preferential treatment ?
>Telling you that imports / exports will be scrutinized ?
>Telling you that the well being of British citizens is an afterthought over the well-being of EU citizens ?
No, no, no
>And as for Gibraltar - expect the EU from now on to be on the Spanish side of things - since you guys are not part of the club anymore
My exact point was that the UK is being framed as an enemy by the EU, and then you say "if you're not in our club we will support our members illegal claims on your land".
How the fuck is that not hostile
>That’s not hostility
That’s just politics
Sure, and if the UK decided to vocally support and fund Catalonian independence movements, that would just be politics
No hostility
Just politics
And the UK's response will also be between the UK and Spain of course
>No that would be hostility - as the UK would interfere in the internal politics of another country - the same as if Spain would help Scotland to gain independence for example (which it doesn’t do)
So is Macron saying "Irish unification would solve the brexit issue" not interfering in the internal politics of another country
You seem to be struggling to apply any consistent scrutiny to the EU that you're applying to the UK
Let's see if you're capable
Interesting
So Macron can call for Irish unification and that is fine
Not a hostile act
Totally diplomatically reasonable
This jingoism will come back to bite Europe
It may take a long time, but it will
>If you call someone saying “hey there is a problem here that can be solved like this, but in the end it’s up to you” jingoism well - then everything is jingoism as soon as someone dares to say anything that doesn’t fall in line with UK wishes
So if Boris Johnson stated publicly "Catalonian independence would solve the problems there at the moment" this would be acceptable in your opinion
The weakening of Spain and the distraction of Spain from Gibraltar via the Catalonian question would absolutely be of British interest in regard to Gibraltar
Of course
The same way Macron is supporting the break up of the United Kingdom we should advocate the break up of Spain as a means to an end regarding Gibraltar
Perhaps a support of Catalonia in exchange for their support against Spanish Francoists on Gibraltar
Sounds like an excellent idea
All diplomatically acceptable according to you of course
>And in fact Johnson had an opinion about the referendum it was (and I quote) : “The Catalonian referendum is a matter for the Spanish govt & people
Imp that Spanish constitution respected & the rule of law upheld
“ so he basically said what I said -> it’s an internal Spanish matter which does not affect anyone else and had to be solved there
So Johnson did the exact opposite of what Macron did
How is this contributing to your point
> Again - Irland is Part of the EU, France is Part of the EU, as such France is interested in a positive outcome of Brexit for Ireland
Which includes no violence in NI due to the possibility of a hard border between NI and the Republic
But Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, is leaving, in the same sense you wouldn't expect Macron to support the UK as it is leaving
>Plus support for Catalonian independence would probably give Scottish independence also rise - and I guess you don’t want that
If the Scots want to be independent good for them
> And are you finally able or willing to Answer my questions ?
Sure
Your argument seems to be that because the UK is leaving the EU, the EU should happily support any jingoistic action against the UK, whether it be blockading Gibraltar or lobbying for the break up of the UK
To which you ask "what do you expect"?
I would expect such actions from Russia or China, not from the EU
Perhaps my expectations are too high
David Cameron coined the idea of Brexit and then campaigned against it, thus meaning he had to resign
Boris Johnson rugby tackled a 7 year old asian child
There were euro sceptics about for a long time before Cameron
But yeah he really fucked It with the promise of the referendum lol
Did he also birth Nigel Farage on that fateful day of “coining brexit
He gave us the vote to get into power
I love how we’ve culminated together on one comment
All the chippys close

That's awesome
Are Irish pubs actually closed or only 'officially closed'?
Spoken to a pub landlord in England who was talking about trying to do lock-ins if the government closes the pubs
So even if they put a ban on protesting you’ll go out on protest against medical advice
Don’t encourage them to claim even more European ‘heritage’
Answer the question
I genuinely have no idea what you mean by that movie point
So you half answered it there
Now answer this question; if the government bans large gatherings and protesting during this pandemic, will you ignore it
So why do they always say their 2/73 Dutch with a sprinkle of Italian
They’re proper weird with that shit
So what I’ve learnt today is that you can’t do hypotheticals
Ducking hell, either I’ve worded this shit wrong or you’re an actual walking stereotype
That’s not a complement
Good for you mate
We need more of that in England
I’ll Definitely be doing that
since 2016, no
A certain ball kicking event has been implanted in our brains since
You mean Luxembourg
Not Liechtenstein
I would support it but would it be sustainable
Would enough people use the line for it to be worth it
First skip then general read
The good thing about this sub is seeing what people have in common and fascinating differences that are incomprehensible
couldn't do that without reading other nations
I would do the same for the Brit ones but there are so many, it's like a plague you can't control
Yes, a lot, and I still don't know how to feel about them
Yeah quite a lot
It normally shows a depressed looking african child with some sad music in the background then asks you to donate to build schools and to get clean water to their towns
I feel like a lot of the Starving African Children images go back to the Ethiopian famine of 1984 to which Band/Live Aid was a response
The [famous report by Michael Buerk] on British TV, in a period when you just didn't see images like that, is certainly seared into my memory - I'd have been 6 when it first aired - and prompted a massive response from the public
*Do They Know It's Christmas* gets a lot of (justified) stick for it's lyrics but it's easy to forget the images that were in people's heads when writing, recording and buying it - nobody was thinking thst there were starviing kids in Morocco or South Africa or Ghana - it was specifically about Ethiopia in 1984
If "Ethiopia" had three syllables the song wouldn't get nearly as much criticism
Likewise, Ethiopia is majority Christian but the song doesn't think they don't know it's Christmas because they're Muslim, but because they're *busy with an apocalyptic famine*.
English person here
I didn’t know this but found it really funny when I found out
We have a word for “public homosexual intercourse” and the word for that is cottaging
I don’t know how that word came around but it’s just funny how that somehow became a problem for us so we had to make a word for it
English person here
I didn’t know this but found it really funny when I found out
We have a word for “public homosexual intercourse” and the word for that is cottaging
I don’t know how that word came around but it’s just funny how that somehow became a problem for us so we had to make a word for it
Not a word really used outside of someone deliberately using it to sound ridiculous
They only say kindergarten in the USA
We just say Nursery or playgroup in the UK
Only in the US
In the UK it’s ‘nursery’.
I mean in England we just use nursery but yeah
I'm sure you'll find there's plenty of words in your own language taken from English
It’s crazy that so many people are commenting about ‘stolen’ words
One of English’s defining features is how mixed it is and how many loanwords we have
Most of the vocabulary in English is derived from French
It’s usually translated by English speakers as ‘separateness’.
The O is silent, if that helps
It's not a bad word
It's used on the news, during sports etc
It's mainstream
I imagine pussywhipped is probably a closer comparison to Mounódoulos
> synecdoche
I've never heard or read that word anywhere ever
Probably the same way cottaging came around
It became a problem in the country then they had to write a law on it
Ah, that's the proper word
I learned a pidgin version as "lunterfutting" years ago, but I'm pleased to know the real one
I know I know
just pointing out that people seem surprised that words aren’t changed or anglicised
Just taken and used as is hahaha
And
I have no idea what woman you’re about
link
dogging is where you watch someone have intercourse in public and cottaging is where you engage in homosexual intercourse in public
Usually no one is watching when cottaging is happening
They’re tremendous
Wait seriously
I can't remember the last time snow fell on my birthday (25th December)
(England) Whenever England play Germany, youll hear "2 World wars and 1 world cup" chants
And there might be the odd war joke, nothing serious
I've never actually heard any serious xenophobia towards Germany
I don’t think so, it’s a hard one with the UK
I think because we were never occupied there is not really any hatred nowadays to them or anything, but obviously a lot of former ww2 fighters and euro skeptics will not like them
There is some in the UK, mostly amongst chavs (British version of rednecks) who spend their time getting drunk and being racist in pubs
Because we’re taking the piss
It’s being comedically arrogant _and_ self-deprecating
We know the stats
Frankly the only reason why people are so against Germany regarding football is because you’re so fucking good at it (most of the time)
Theyre not very smart
Wack a bit of drum and bass behind it and its a bop, Lizzies bopaholic tunes
Quality episode
Wasn't aware of it, im 18 and I'm Welsh
As far as I'm aware, foktball hooliganism isn't something that reflect the gernal attitude of the country
>Morris dancing
Should be a capital offense in my opinion
To be honest, any European company that seemed vaguely foreign as a kid all came from an imaginary country that was a mixture of every European country west of Poland where people's lips never synched up to what they were saying
>Häagen-Dazs
For anyone who doesn't know, they chose that brand name so it would sound Danish and therefore cool
The irony of course is that it doesn't look even remotely Danish, but of course it does succeed in sounding sort of exotic
You barely get baked beans in the US
That's rather sad
They don't *only* go with fry ups
> how is sounding Danish a business strategy
I think Scandinavian stuff was in fashion
But remember this was from someone who clearly had no idea about Danish (and aimed at people who had no more idea) so I suppose it's not surprising they made an error
They chose that name about 20 years before the internet was invented XD
What can I say -- they're good
*Universal* Healthcare is a must but it doesn't have to look like, for example, the NHS, where the entire system is funded from taxes because otherwise ThEyRe PrIvAtIiSiNg tHe NhS

It's crazy how much it changes within a few miles
I live about 15 miles outside manchester and our tap water is class
As soon as I moved to central manc it was much worse
It's weird because the reservoir I can see from my window sends water to Liverpool/Wigan and we get lake district water
I guess that second part explains why ours is good though
Basic social interaction with strangers in public seems to be a big no no in england, hehe
Went to a Auschwitz
The amount of twats taking selfies pissed me off
Is respecting the dead that difficult
I've noticed it's often misspelt as Whales
Maybe they think The Prince of Whales is just some bizarre British tradition where he is actually claiming to be the king of the whales
70% of British people will believe a statistic if you put a percentage in front of it
Lots of Turks smuggle German cigarettes to the English black market
Why have you bot taxed the fuck out of it like everyone else
Flula Borg makes up for it
A big problem in my opinion is the lack of emphasis of learning from a young age
Of course, the fact that a GCSE in a language is no longer mandatory sucks, but honestly the standard of GCSE French (from my experience of being a 16 year old who would have been sitting the exams this year) is tripe, and it is, of course, much harder to learn them as you get older
Stands up
Half my championship team is Austrian, even the manager
It appears 85% of french people do too
It’s infuriating
We’re constantly entering the most boring, generic dross and wonder why we always do shit

Bot sure what team we got him fro
Sounds like england could join too
Interesting I would have expected the UK to be more mid table too
Yeah I've had a few situations with Irish people (I find Irish people on reddit will swear blind that these situations never happen or I must have been super unlucky but its something thats happened with almost every Irish person i've met) where after a few drinks they will start talking about all the bad things 'the English' have done and how 'the English' are naturally bad people
I'll usually give a sarcastic 'yeah thanks lads, sound of you' and get a 'oh but I dont mean you, I mean 'the English' in response
I’m English and my boyfriend is Irish, more specifically Northern Irish
Whenever we talk about the shit that the UK has inflicted upon Ireland over the centuries, it’s always with the obvious understanding that 99% of modern British people had absolutely nothing to do with any of it
I think what Irish people really want is just for British people to be more aware of our shared history
That’s all
That being said
very, very occasionally, you do get the impression that some people want the British to feel guilty for crimes past
The phrase “don’t hold your breath” comes to mind
TBF all the jokes aside I dont think the numerous wars between our countries could ever be awkward, its just like a non thing
Yeah 100% same with my experiences, I always stand by my view that in my travels the Irish i meet are always the ones we have the most fun with, with how similar we are it's baffling the history is so messy and tragically brutal
That's not the sort of thing anyone world banter about though
I doubt the UK is wealthier than Spain or Italy
The UK has a lot of poverty
As others have said, diet and climate is a big factor
But, in my opinion, it's lazy bastards
Here in the UK, we have a very lenient benefits system which is abused
People use it as an excuse not to work, becoming 'couch potatoes' and therefore not exercising their bodies
I'm not saying all of those who are on benefits are the same, a lot are genuine, but it is taken advantage of
As a motorcycle rider I do fit the stereotype and I pretty much speed everywhere apart from residential area's. Trouble is on my 650km weekly commute I doubt I see a police office once a week, so basically we don't have anyone to enforce anything, part of the reason driving standards are getting worse year on year
In fairness I think people would behave very differently to seeing two women holding hands and two men holding hands
Ahh well that’s alright then
Nothing to worry about
Nothing at all
My school was infamous for their pranks after exams a few notable mentions are filling the geography classroom with crickets and locusts; sewing a fish into the curtains so over summer it rotted and the class had to be shut; releasing 3 chickens with 1,2 and 4 tied round their neck so the teachers spent 2 weeks looking for number 3 and using weed killer to draw a penis on the front field the week the google street view car was due
Nerf gun school shooting
We have muck up day, on the year 13s last day at school, where they can do anything they want, blue up paint bombs, interrupt classes, trap cows on the roof, put constipation meds in ice cream and give it to the students
There's something called muck-up day which is quite common (i think)
It's for leavers, and on the last day of the school year, before study leave and GCSE/A level exams are taken, when everyone else is still in school for the next few months, year 11/13 supposedly get to do whatever they want
My first year at secondary school was wild (well, compared to recent years), since they had waterguns, silly strings, moved everything around in the school (aka lockers were all over the place, so where desks/chairs etc), they also did flour bombs and put pads on the door handles and a ton of other stuff that I can't particularly remember
The annoying thing is that stuff happened the next year, which is why the school has been cracking down on it really hard, and it's now become quite strict and limited to (i think) before/after school
one of the most scottish things i've ever read
U dont gave muck up day
We had end of year 11 pranks at my school - South West
The only one i remember is that our physics teacher was always starring at his clock (understandably
) so some kids stole his clock
Pretty tame - i like your bin one more
They can't even manage a different accent half the time so another language is definitely a big ask
Howling with laughter at Upham in *Saving Private Ryan* describing his German accent as "clean, with a touch of Bavarian".
His English sounds ridiculous as well, but that might be the cocainum
In the north of uk where I am it’s very common if you’re in a rural area to say hi to people or wish them a good morning/afternoon/evening although I’ve found younger people are more and more inclined not to do this so it’s become more of an older or polite thing to do but very few would consider it outright rude not to make eye contact or say hello, unless they say hello and you don’t reply haha
I found it was nice when walking my dog to say hi and be nice to randoms it just seemed to set my day up in a nice way :)
Only really (from my experience) if the path isn’t very busy
I've been told it's because it's cheaper than having a bouncer in there to make sure drunk dickheads aren't trashing the place
Not common but you'll likely see a few people doing this in the UK
I live in Toronto now and most women would call me sexist if I addressed them with any of those terms
They're brothers, the Healy-Raes
They represent a very rural area where there's no late public transport and few (if any) taxis so this attitude goes down well with the locals
Rest of the country (as far as I can tell) think they're a pair of lunatics
Just feel like its worth adding; To go dutch is a phrase that is very rarely said here
We say 'split the bill'.
Nice ones for us, savage ones for the French
Ah, the old alliance
Its a very old expression and rarely used
I think the Americans might still use it
So many of us are accepting draconian policies under the premise of the emergency that we can't be that punitive until it's over
Orbán will always have the argument it's justified to save lives, he's not extreme; it's us that aren't doing enough
Once the pandemic is over is when the EU or whoever needs to come down on any government that won't relinquish their emergency powers
In practice I'm not sure what the EU of other national governments cant really do
Sanctions perhaps
The problem with Hungary is that nobody seriously wants to put the main opposition in power
Jobbik are not better than Orban
I'd rather have a dictator than a nazi personally
The EU - the institution - will survive even if their "European dream" never realises
They still have a few countries that might join, mainly in the Balkans, like Albania and Montenegro
Furthermore the far-right populist movement is waning in most countries and also have differing views on the EU, even the LN-M5S coalition never tried to Itexit, and the far-left populist movement isn't a big threat
I'm sure the great day when Turkey and Russia and Belarus and Azerbaijan and a reunified Moldova and Armenia which all have 100/100 Freedom House Scores are part of a United Europe won't come any time soon but the EU isn't going anywhere
the biggest nightmare is if the EU gets taken over by people like that, I'd rather it just died than that happened
Still, there's too many countries that vote overwhelmingly for pro-EU parties
Even in Germany, AfD and all, the Union/SPD/Greens would still get a majority (without even factoring in the FDP and other parties)
I was in Romania and Moldova recently, and a lot of the Romanians say the Roma are thieves etc, because they are
Whether that's because of years of discrimination and not being able to get regular work isn't really our problem, but I don't want  any people without a basic education coming in to the UK
I was once on the phone to a Glaswegian and it took me a few seconds to realise he was speaking English

I think it's likely that's how they come to the conclusion
Yeah well, I’m a 170cm tall guy and I have to get literally every pair of jeans or trousers I own altered
In fact, that’s the case for everything that isn’t a t-shirt or a jumper
Short tax, baby
I have no qualms with candles, those wax statues of public figures are disturbing though and I wouldn’t mind never seeing one again
I don't like Mandatory, but the community has a responsibility to protect the vulnerable which includes both children who cannot be vaccinated and the children of anti-vaxxers
You would need to exclude those kids not vaccinated from schools, and a lot of public spaces which would amount to child neglect by the parents by denying them a normal upbringing, so sort of enforced vaccination by the back door
Probably more honest to make it mandatory
Not my country but in france, Sour Patch Kids are called "Very Bad Kids" I just find it hilarious
I love hot weather
Been out to the park three days in a row
I’m cooking and I love it
I just sit in front  of the fan all day and I am fine
It's actually cold and rainy today, which is nice because our central heating system is STUCK ON
We can't turn it off, or down, because a little valve is jammed open
But all the plumbers in our area have everyone bar one guy on furlough, so unless you've actually got water spraying everywhere you're shit outta luck
I have got multiple fans on me
It helps but not enough
I end up sleeping in a dripping wet teeshirt to stay cool and it's dry within a few hours
It's fine
Windows are open (at least until this afternoon's lively thunderstorm)
The really annoying thing is that we did actually get a plumber out, he looked at it, told us what was wrong, bu couldn't come back because he's allergic to cats and we have one
Apparently he had quite a spectacular reaction
You'd have thought if you were *that* allergic that a) a job going into people's houses wouldn't be ideal; b) you might mention it to the house owner c) you might be alert to things lile giant cat trees right inside the front door and d) that your employer might find someone else to be the only non-furloughed plumber on staff
I can see that
(Just to be clear, we did not threaten our plumber with a cat, or anything else
It's been said that a yorkshireman is born with a flat cap on his head and a ferret down his trousers
Just for people who dont know; Hurling is a sport
No its literal
English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish people identity more as English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish than what they do as British
This is probably because England, Scotland, Wales and Northern are Ireland are considered countries inside a country, and have their own sports teams and governments
I identify as English first, British second and European third
I think British is more of an upper class identity
Understandable
Sometimes I wish I lived/studied/worked abroad or had an ethnic background from elsewhere so it gives me motivation to study another language
Languages are beautiful things, but I simply don’t know what to learn and don’t want to go ahead with a language only to find one I prefer over it and starting again
The closest I really have to a non-English background are some Welsh relatives, but they aren’t even blood and simply married into my family via my grandmother (see a relative like a step-grandad)
My grandmother’s maiden name was Esnouf which, according to her, is Scandinavian but that’s as far as it goes, no country in particular
That’s generally true with people from immigrant backgrounds
Black people and Indian people identify more as British since British is a nationality and English is an ethnicity
I feel we have the highest frequency of ugly cities in Europe
You can barely mention where you’re from online without someone calling it a shithole
Milton Keynes, Luton and Slough are probably considered the trinity of ugly
Birmingham
The most disgusting mishmash of random buildings
They don’t even look that bad lol, but in the U.K. Scunthorpe, Skegness, mablethorpe, slough, gravesend, Blackpool, Birmingham, Oldham, Liverpool, a lot of Kent
Basically a lot of the coastal towns specifically on the east coast of England are really poor and run down, and look awful
Blackpool is the poorest town in the U.K. I would say, Oldham is just known for being a shithole and Birmingham and Liverpool as they are quite big are not really as bad it’s more of like a joke that they are shitholes, but they still are quite bad and the accents are ugly as fuck imo
Preston:
Blackpool:
Jesus fucking Christ
A wetter and mildly more depressing Milton Keynes then
It's pretty clear why
We were the world's first industrial country, therefore most of our main cities were industrial and got destroyed by post war planners
Most of our ''ugly cities'' are in fact towns with industrial hertiage
Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham,  Coventry, etc all former industry cities
Most of them were built to be industrial
But we also have Durham, Bath, Oxford, Cambridge, York, Chester and tons of nice villages and towns
Yes, our main cities may not be the prettiest but they are often near country hills and green landscapes and a lot of them are going through regeneration
They're becoming much nicer places to live due to the post war buildings being revamped
Let me add Grimsby, Swindon and Gosport to that list
Granted they are towns but still
I also have a particular hatred for Basingstoke but its more bland than ugly
I can smell the picture
In contrast to most of wales that is ugly as hell
That's not a city though
Slight correction about Coventry
Coventry was actually our biggest medieval city and one of the most preserved medieval cities in Europe
Its thanks to the Luftwaffe and post war planners that its not in the same category as Bath or York
Coventry was redeveloped against its own wishes, due to being tragically flattened by the Luftwaffe
It also has the skydome which makes me happy
However, the ring road is truly something dystopian
Driving on it I feel it would feel more at home in Gotham (batman, not Notts little town) than in a mid sized British city
That's a town
And there's a really, really valid reason why they are ugly which some people fail to understand and know about
Anyone with knowledge of the Industrial Revolution and WW2 will understand why hopefully
Most of them were bad in the post war era and the 70s/80s - they've gone through regeneration and are becoming much nicer cities
Sadly, the stereotypes won't die away
I live in Huddersfield, its actually really picturesque with it being in the middle of a small valley
To be honest the majority of northern England is very pretty, even the major cities tend to have some really nice architecture from many different periods
A lot of it is down to how well its maintained
I'm originally from Preston in Lancashire, around 10 years ago it was honestly resembling a North Korean slum but has had so much money piled into it due to its growing reputation as the up and coming newest city in the UK, they've really turned it around
Edit: Huddersfield isn't a city lol
I'm moving down to Swansea next month and lemme tell ya, overall it's far prettier (and smaller) than the deprived hell scape that is most of urban South Yorkshire
Edit: (port Talbot is an eyesore though 100%)
Thanks bro lol
Birmingham also used to be quite nice with loads of Victorian redbrick gothic, but it was all knocked down in favour of brutalism and motorways
Huddersfield is split 50/50 between nice little villages in the hills and runned down areas a mile away from the town centre
As a result of that though, the town centre is pretty shit and has a fair bit of crime and a lot of chavs
Pretty much no one takes learning a language here seriously which is a massive shame
Think it’s a mix of most places speaking English as a second language and not starting it early enough in schools
Whenever I’ve tried to speak French when I’ve been there people just answer in English like cmon lads at least let me try lol
Its a great place
Although I can't say I miss it haha
I had no idea
I feel for all the other stations as St Pancras is leaps and bounds ahead of Preston haha
The bus station in Preston was the biggest bus station in Europe when it was built
I'm not sure what grade but I know its a listed building
Ive been to both Rome and Naples and i get what you are saying
The city centres are beautiful (if terrifying to drive in), but the suburbs are unbelievably ugly
Then as soon as you are out of the city limits the backwater towns and villages become beautiful again
It is a new town that was built based on American Post-war urban design principles I.e built with the automobile in mind
They did this in Birmingham with the old [library] but the new one hardly looks any [better]
Yeah the 60s brought a lot of great cultural icons, but it also has a lot to answer for with its stack-‘em-high, build-‘em-cheap architecture
Maybe it’s the public space
In American cities people seem to live half their lives in their own cars and suburban, if you’re so used to urban space being private and occupied exclusively for and by you you’re gonna treat it as your own and give fewer fucks about acting weird
In Europe so much of city life you’re acutely conscious of sharing space and trying to do as little as possible to inconvenience others
It’s not just about greater use of public transport
If I walk down a street in London I can see cars, cycle lanes, tube stops, multiple buses, shops on either side of the pavement with terraced housing above, more apartments, council housing leading into council estates, and loads of other people trying to get past me on the pavements
Millions of different people trying to navigate through the city and use it for other purposes
If I walk down a street in LA I can see two lanes of traffic filled with SUVs, lots of empty lots or condos back from the street side, parking, the occasional strip mall or gas station and nobody else on the side walk making me feel like a weirdo anyway
When everybody seems siloed away in their own buildings or cars, every other person on the sidewalk I’m gonna be wary of and think them weird
People abusing prescription medication seems to be a thing in the US, while almost non-existant elsewhere
Could that be a contributing factor
That is weird
You know something’s expensive when the Scandinavian’s are complaining about the price
The guy on the raft is fucking toasted, I mean absolutely gone
That picture looks like a scene out of a Quentin Tarantino film or something
Also that priest with the sunglasses is absolutely nailing the badass, cool af Hollywood action star pose
He looks more like a wild west gunslinger than the cowboy to his right does
Does the pries in the middle have his eyes shut
Maybe just a severe squint
Please tell me why they're shooting a ribbon
What did the ribbon do
If you haven’t caused a scene on a Friday night have you ever really lived
Ah, a balloon
Now it makes perfect sense

North East England, it has the suicide and drug overdose rate of Scotland, is more impoverished than Northern Ireland and Wales, has 1 of the lowest rates of forest cover in Europe and has poor transport links with the rest of the UK; overall it is a grey urban hell in need of massive regeneration
Northern Ireland
Laws passed always take forever to get through to there and many of them don’t even want to be part of the country
> to top it all off theyre being invaded by scousers
Fate worse than death
I think the problem with Eastern Moldova is that the cities there are shitholes and the transport is fucked
The countryside is beautiful, people are mostly nice (the Moldovans are nice, the 'Transnistrians' are mostly arseholes), and they have fantastic wines and Cognacs, as well as good fresh produce, but nobody from richer countries will travel there because of the effort
After going to the Moldovan cities, Bucharest was a serious upgrade
**Tiraspol is the single worst city I have been to in my life,** I mean the place is better maintained than Chisinau, but you literally cannot relax there, I mean I didn't go there to relax, I went there to see all of Russia's dodgy shit, but the people are really hostile (like we had a local guide and even then the Priests were chasing the tour group out of monasteries even though we paid to visit etc, had to rust out of 3 different bars)
On the plus side, it's the cheapest place I've ever seen, and they have roads which actually exist on their side of the river
Chisinau has nice parts, I liked the museums of Dacian history and stuff, but the city outside of the very very centre (which is nice) is totally fucked, like, there are buildings falling down everywhere there
The main problem is the transport tbh, Moldovan roads barely exist, they are bumpy as hell, and the train from Chisinau to Bucharest is grim, even if you get 1st class like us, luckily we just got completely drunk on Moldovan wine until we got to Bucharest so it was fine, but it's a really bad train, like a Soviet train from the 1970's without repairs
We can swap you for some of ours if you want\*
\*definitely not desperately trying to offload Pitcairn onto unsuspecting Frenchmen
I'm not remotely convinced by the arguments that a place like the North East isn't economical for the government to invest in
Tyne and Wear is a metropolitan area of 1
1 million people, the 6th largest in the UK, it has historical significance within Northumbria and has great education institutions with Durham, Newcastle and Northumbria University
Yes investing in a place like London or Birmingham will yield a higher profit margin in the short-term but Tyne and Wear is still profitable and its important to reduce regional inequality to ensure political stability
But the over-arching solution to the North East is simple, greater infrastructure spending and regeneration projects
The fact that the whole region has a single motorway going in, the A1(M) really says enough; its just neglect
Mayotte looks incredibly bad from a quick search
Worse than Monsterrat (our worse overseas territory) but they at least had a volcanic eruption which destroyed their capital city
Because the region is impoverished and a part of reducing poverty is increasing the economic efficiency of the area
I know about this because I researched my family history, and one of my direct ancestors was a British soldier sent to the Vendee on a covert mission to help the loyalists
I wish I was that cool
I'd just like to say that no one I know thinks of him as a hero
Most people remember him as someone who banned dancing and Christmas carols, so more like a Turkmenbashi sort of figure than a hero
I will admit most don't know about the invasion of Ireland, however
He isn't considered a hero here at all
He's considered as a regicidal dictator who hated fun and banned Christmas
He was disliked so much that people welcomed the monarchy back with open arms when he went
Because Irish people (rightly) learn so much about Britain's invasions of Ireland as it has played such a major part in Irish History this belief that in the UK we all apparently learn the opposite and that we somehow sit around celebrating this history is just bizarre
I cannot stress how much the likes Cromwell are just complete vague figures of history to the British public
The idea that he is a hero is laughable, most people wouldn't be able to tell you who he even was and a significant number will say he was bad person
I know its probably weird for you to hear this but in the UK the history with Ireland isn't really seen as that important at all and its rarely (if ever) thought about
Most people are either unaware or just dont have any opinions about it
A statue which was hugely controversial even many years before it was built many people rejected the idea
Basically was only built because the PM paid for it himself
Les not pretend that the people had anything to do with this nor that average brit has even given a fuck about him the past 300 years
I think that's just a wry reminder from parliament to the monarchy about who is really in power
The average bloke definitely doesn't think he's a hero
Somebody like Churchill, definitely, but not Cromwell
I still dont understand where you're getting this idea from
I've seen Irish users on Reddit say Cromwell is loved because there's roads named after him or something like that
Could be that
I used to live near a street called Cat Brain Hill and i'll you this for a fact, cat brains are not heroes
The most famous Cromwell Road would be the one in London with the V&A etc on it, its actually named after Oliver's son because he used to live on it
takeaway on a weekday
idk if that's just my family but takeaway nights were Saturday nights and even now it feels wrong to have fastfood during the week
another one is turning on the interior car lights while it's being driven, my dad used to lose his marbles when we did that, but i dont think that's necessarily specific to my culture
I revel in it
"Oh this thing
I picked it up from a little German number down the street
She's cheaper than you and I get things from her I simply can't get from you
But I'll do you a favour and buy a little here too"
I'm only straight pimpin' when it comes to Supermarkets
FYI "cutting the cheese" is a slang term for farting
Real ale in old fashioned British pubs used to be served in ceramic tankards too
This used to be a thing in Northern English; [Yan Tan Tethera]
I heard that it was because the Anglo Saxons were the peasants that farmed the animals, and the Norman's were the ruling class that only ate the meat, and that's why animal names are of Anglo-Saxon origin and the meat names are French
Winter time; solar noon is closer to regular noon then
Queen Elizabeth sends birthday messages to anyone who is turning 100 or 105
She also sends congratulation messages to people’s 60th, 65th, or 70th wedding anniversaries
I’m not too fond of the royal family but I do think this is a pretty wholesome thing
That’s amazing
I didn’t even think we’d end up offering them ILRs
Big up to whoever made that decision
Ireland was indeed the first country to legalise same-sex marriage by public vote
Manchester, England
Palermo, Sicily
Mediterranean climate, renaissance architecture and mafia
Venice
But futuristic so there's roads
London or Moscow 100%.
Just literally *that* kind of tourist from every country
0/10 unless the German tourists and British tourists start drunk fighting
>The ones that head on stag dos or to drink a year earlier (legal age is 17 for hard liquor) then yes, we do get chavs
Tbh at least they are more respectful of everything than they are in Amsterdam (probably because you left such a big impact that some British norms are ingrained in Maltese culture now, and it’s easier for them to adapt)
That isn't Chavs, chav teenagers drink from the local offie, the 17 year olds who go to Malta to drink are middle class/rich kids generally, you need good money to go Malta on the piss at that age
The retired blokes are sometimes ex Navy, but also mostly not Chavs, Chavs go to Spain
I feel like this shouldnt need to be said but often on reddit i see people complaining about how much of a rip off touristy shit restaurants in Zone 1 in London are
Do not go to the chain restaurant in most of the most touristy places in the world, whether it is New York, Paris, London etc etc
Actually blows my mind that people will come onto reddit and complain that they went to an awful restaurant on Oxford Street and paid lots of money for a shit experience, what did you expect
Might as well go complain that you had to queue to see the Mona Lisa
Like with all touristy places, do your research, do not just expect to be able to find something good and affordable
When I went to Lapland in Finland it wasn’t super touristy
One gift shop along an hour road to the airport
Seeing Father Christmas was a bit touristy but it is what it is
And the husky/reindeer rides just seemed like the Lapland version of Blackpool
The industry was clearly tourist related but it didn’t feel horrible and monetised like some places do
Awww I liked Loch Ness when I went
Also wasn’t busy at all
Sporting events aside, I genuinely can't tell why people go to London for tourism
> Some tourist activities like going on a boat along the Seine will also empty your pockets really quick
Every time I go to Paris I just pay like €19 for a 48 hour pass on the Batobus
No idea why anyone would pay a more expensive price for a 1 or 2 hour boat trip
I went as a kid and thought the tower was great
The beefeaters are pretty decent guides
I’ve been to Paris 4 times - twice in winter and twice in summer
Definitely enjoyed the experience during the winter far more, due to there being 90% less tourists
I love the atmosphere in London
I’ve done a lot of the touristy stuff but there’s still more to do
I was in Venice last summer and think it was €30 for a 48 hour vaporetto pass
Might sound expensive but that got us all round Venice and to Murano and Burano
It was definitely worth it for me
I wouldn’t even dream of paying €80 for a 1 hour gondola ride though
Maybe if I won the lottery and had money to burn
Right settle a debate for me then
Is it pronounced rhyming with "idea" or with "India"
I could be wrong, but wouldn't a late 19th Century Transylvanian nobleman br more likely to speak German or Hungarian anyway
> William Wallace wasn't a Highlander in a kilt, he was a medieval noble in chainmail riding about on a horse, like a knight
The film also left out the fact that he was a gay paedophile
And we're the villains in everything else
You’re in the Vatican
ahh makes sense to me, have a good one
Don't forget Outlander, the completely unrelated movie about aliens invading Iron Age Norway
That Great Thunberg and Madeline McCann are the same person (They were born in the same year) and Madeline was kidnapped by Greta's Swedish parents and had her name and identity changed
I can believe that Magyars are from outer space to be fair
I agree
My gf did Erasmus and yet she has settled for some balding pisshead from her own town rather than some charming Italian or Greek chap
I write it as

That’s why I lengethen the r to the right by a little then loop it and then you can do any letter

Wierd how that is
Not something we can joke about about without really offending some people
Not exactly, but we do think of the French as cheese eating surrender monkeys
As far as I'm aware, the main jokes are: 'We used to rule the world, you know' \*swigs beer while watching the news\*
and
'They'll be begging to come back any day now

The largest group is actually English but the descendants of English people tend to identify as American only
A lot of people also don't know they have a lot of English ancestry and families cling onto their small Irish, German, Norwegian etc roots
The vast majority of product prices I see in England are put on in the shop (either on the shelf or as a sticker on the product)
So it's not difficult
In the UK we have that
It’s because of the Equalities Act, to make sure minorities aren’t being discriminated against,
I also find it weird when Americans with English roots describe themselves as Anglo-Saxon
“Especially the British press had a bad habit of taking it a bit too literally
I mean that’s just true in general
Whilst not entirely a secret, I feel Bristol is pretty overlooked
Don’t usually see many tourists there other than groups of like French school kids on a trip
What
Its like a major tourist destination
I member going there decades ago to avoid Florence but it was still touristy
Just about every single guide to Tuscany/Italy says Siena is a must do
In Vietnam back at Christmas one of my Icelandic pals I met there told me how the population would triple during summer months from sheer tourism, and how him and his mates' best kept nature secrets where discovered and ruined by travel bloggers and tourists
Was genuinely gutted to hear, I'd love to see Iceland but don't want to add to the human mass that arrives every year
Dammit I saw Dundee uni as an option and went for Edinburgh instead (they said no boo)
Wish I saw this first
Haha
I remember reading that at least one Australian Aboriginal dialect has the word "dog" for a dog
My favourite with Polish/English is "no" meaning "yeah" and "yeah" sounding quite like "nie", can get a bit confusing when speaking Ponglish
The biggest thing that tripped me up when I began learning German was that 'Ich will
' is not the same as 'I will
' and is instead 'I want
Lots of discussions have gone on about the obsession in the UK with news from the US
Far more time is given to news from the US than from other European countries and sometimes even more than our own national stories
Especially with the upcoming US election our news coverage is currently at least 20% about the US, sometimes at much as 75% of the nightly news will be about the US
This has lead to many problems especially as many people seem to think that the police here in the UK are going around killing people just like they do in the US
I wouldn't say 'overwhelmed' but I really couldn't care less about American politics
It's often the leading news story (I think partly to slip the news about how badly Britain's government is doing under the radar)
News in England is often about the USA, especially when talking about celebrities
We have a weird obsession with American TV and American celebrities
The USA dominates, unless it’s on UK specific outlets
Can we have boring news please
We misaimed and got depressing instead
Jersey has British channels with Channel Islands locality (for the local news segments) so lots about Britain and the other islands but less about France
the Scandinavian countries look cool and some statistics show that they're pretty happy places too
I've always wanted to live in a small town in germany
Either Switzerland because of its high quality of living, or Italy because of the beautiful climate and picturesque views
They just weren't bothered that people could understand them
Chances are nobody is going to hear who knows the man's girlfriend
British people are generally aware that many people in Europe speak English
It's rare someone English would speak in English rudely/about something private assuming nobody around them speaks English
I think they probably just didn't care
Pretty much
As far as I'm concerned he earned himself a big payday
I never heard of or seen those, and I never knew the "normal" one was French
Yes, I (used to before lockdown) play with these cards with my half-Italian friend
We would play scopa a lot
It's the only reason I know these cards exist but it's a nice bit of culture that I wouldnt have known
When I went to Italy I bought two of these packs
Definitely
If it gets the 4/5 then ill think about putting a jumper on
Same tbf
Never thought I’d see an Australian jealous of the European climate
I live in southern England, the hottest summer days are usually around mid to late 20’s and the coldest winter days are usually around 0-5 degrees
The real darkness here starts in late October when the clocks go forward
Suddenly sunset is around half 4 in the afternoon, and gets earlier and earlier until the winter solstice in December where the sun rises around 8am, and sets around 3:50pm (not even 8 hours of daylight)
Usually the build up to Christmas isn’t too bad cos you’re focussing on that, you go to your work parties and do the late night Xmas shopping under the Xmas lights
Then suddenly it’s January
I HATE January and February
It’s cold and wet, the skies are just grey constantly
No sun, no colour
Grey
Everything is grey forever
The ground is permanently wet
You keep your head down and get through those two appalling months, then March (which sometimes gives you a bit of actual sun, but the wind tends to spoil any enjoyment)
Then the clocks go back, suddenly you’ve got an extra hour of sunlight in the evening
You hit April and Easter and suddenly it’s getting lighter and the temperature’s going up (we’ve actually had some ridiculously hot days already this year considering
Since Easter we’ve had a lot of 15-20 degrees days
This is when the year *actually* starts
Colour comes back, the sky is blue and everything is green and good
At the height of summer the sun will rise at 4:45 and set at nearly half 9pm
Over 16 hours of daylight
We have christmas to look forward to and christmas themed activities to do
I don't even have an issue with it getting dark early, just that I'm waking up in the dark and when I get back from work its dark
Spending all daylight hours in a bleak office is emotionally draining
7 for 18+, but alot of people under 18 smoke around me
in 2018 it was around 15% but that number was declining rapidly and with Covid that number has fallen even further
Most people I know who smoke are what are called 'social smokers' and in they will only smoke when they are in the pub drinking or maybe have a cigarette after a meal when alcohol is drunk
It quite rare to need a smoke break or whatever when working here unless they're from overseas
We have terrible health here in the UK where obesity is fast becoming normal but we seem to have been really great at cutting cigarettes in recent years
The ban on smoking inside in 2007 had a great effect on everyones health
Also, younger smokers in my experience tend to prefer rollies (rolling tobacco) and cigarettes are more for the older generation
Every animal on the planet, apart from humans, runs away from smoke
It's the most ridiculous thing to inhale smoke - and the damage it does, oh Jesus Christ
It stinks, costs a fortune, makes the person smoking look a low-life and a bit thick - and is very, very unhealthy
Newly released figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that around 7
2 million people, or 14
7% of the UK population aged 18 years and above, smoked cigarettes in 2018
This marks a decline of more than 5% since 2011
England had the lowest percentage of smokers at 14
4%, while Scotland had the highest at 16
3%. The percentages in Wales and Northern Ireland were 15
9% and 15
5% respectively
Apparently, it has gone down further since COVID kicked off
Yeah, all my Italian colleagues smoke
Like I wouldn't recognise most of them without a coffee in hand and a cigarette in the other
Maybe they just hold them for the image
I knew people that started smoking in year 6 but there was a few
Early hugh school was the biggest wave
Us Brits feel your pain
The Cyrillic alphabet is actually Byzantine/Greek in terms of its origin and it's first usage before spreading to other parts of the world iirc
Whenever an American TV show mentions the UK, they say England and it annoys me greatly
No one asked you
Except they're mostly Chinese
Fucking hate plastic paddies with a burning passion
why use the scandi cross on the flag
You’re in ask Europe mate
No one asked you no one wants your answer
Congrats on living up to the stereotype tho
Well yeah he’s asking Europe what our pet peeves Are
The UK is the largest exporter of medical marijuana
hell yeah
Combined
That really is surprising
Cant they hold something like 150% of the swiss population
God, we are so fucking dumb
Baked beans gang
TIL
What the hell
It's almost 3 times as much as the rest of the world combined
Absolutely mental
bean boyz fo’ life
On what
Not really in uk I feel like people would disapprove here because there are not many beaches that are both nice and also sunny so at the nice beaches there are also a lot of children so I don't think they would let them
Sorry for rubbish grammar I'm not very smart
Theres nothing fun about that fact haha
Deffo not zero in the UK
As everyone is saying it’s not super common, and perhaps even less than in other parts of Europe, but no way is it zero
I once saw someone sunbathing topless at fucking Skegness of all places
Grim
I dont think i've ever seen it in the UK unless they're lying down on their stomach
Yeah me neither
I wouldn't even go topless in my garden incase the neighbours see, nevermind at the beach lol
I know a lot of women here who think the same
They sound like absolute weirdos tbh mate
Gooogling it is one thing but to bring it up to you is just odd
I’m an english speaker but I can’t understand anything before middle english
I can understand scots perfectly though
To any one reading if you want to find out more about the Saxons and hear what Old-English sounded like, there's a great 3-part BBC series called
King Alfred and the Anglo-Saxons
Its a good watch and relevently it has alot of Old-English fluently spoken in it(via the Saxon contempory sources at the time of the events, its reciting them in the original language), its spoken Old English with Modern English subtitles
Yeah, I think people who understand Germanic or Norse languages have an easier time understanding it than us, because that's what it is tbh
It's totally meaningless to me as an English speaker
Yeah, it looks very Icelandic to me, would be interested to know
In a couple of weeks (5th November) in the UK we have "bonfire night" which celebrates an attempt by Guy Fawkes and others to blow up the Houses of Parliament
What holidays/festivals does your country have that have an interesting story behind them
I’m do excited for it and the fireworks and the sparklers
That's interesting, what's the history behind it
And they were only deciding what they were gonna order for lunch
The fella in the red tie really fancied a number 11 from the local chinese
He mutters, bumbles and stutters every time there's a microphone in front of him
Doesn't help that he's hamming it up for the cameras
Where do I begin
You know, none spring to mind…
I'm English so erm
> Genocide of multiple indigenous peoples in the Americas and Asia
Australia too
We also tested nuclear weapons in the outback and didn't bother to evacuate all the Aboriginal people first
Creating America
In my honest opinion, probably participation in the Scramble for Africa
We just obliterated numerous cultures and nations and redrew the lines, and oppressed the native people for as long as we could
Oh dear .. Africa and India probably
The Indian raj or or something else our fucked up empire did
indian famine, conquering 70% of the world
I'd argue the boer concentration camps weren't supposed to be as bad as they turned out
Most of the starvation was due to bad supply lines which the boers actually sabotaged
Now go hang your head in shame
Was that a joke
Of all the people, Cliff Richard
Not Piers fucking Morgan
Agreed
I hear it all the time on reddit how our empire is "glorified" in our education
I never learned one thing abut the empire in school
The opposite, Sunday funday - go to the pub get drunk and forget about the upcoming week
Sundaysesh
Gu on lad
- Summer and Winter Solstice is probably the most ancient tradition we celebrate
It is certainly not unique to us but its been around for thousands upon thousands of years
- St George's Day and his feast has also been celebrated here for around 1000-1500 years but became a prominent national holiday following the Crusades
- May Day, a fair amount will be familiar with the tradition, its not overly popular here, it seems to be mostly celebrated in the South
- Halloween has its origins in Celtic traditions and we obviously celebrate it but we have a few local traditions, customs and festivals that are likely to have a similar origin: Punkie's Night in Hinton St George, Soul Caking in Cheshire, Hoodening in the east of Kent, the Allendale Baal Fire etc
> carrying a piece of unwrought iron with me
I wonder if that's got the same origins as cold iron keeping evil spirits away
Some kids go around with a fake Guy Fawkes in wheelbarrows and ask for a Penny for a Guy but this part of it died of
[Found this ]
Harvest festival is probably our oldest tradition and will date back till prehistory in one vein or another
Parts of england are further north than parts of Sweden
Hello from Britannia
So those parts arent Scandinavia
Brit who doesn't like tea here
I mean, I don't hate it, it's drinkable, I just rarely choose to do so since I'm not that keen on it
I’m a Brit that doesn’t like tea or full English breakfast
I’m sorry
Brit who doesn't like football
Cricket is better
Don't fite me
Same
Much prefer cold drinks
I do drink tea from time to time, just not super often
Can we swap
*This is legally binding, I've been looking for a way out of this mess since summer 2016*
Oh, I fit that one too then haha
Might want to put an ‘s’ on the end of ‘support’. Atm it reads sort of as the opposite of what I think you’re trying to say
Yeah, who associates *espresso, cappuccino or latte*s with Italians
Yeah I mean mostly I just drink water
Sometimes milk too, but between them that's like 95% of what I drink
No need for tea
The drink haha :)
I said in another comment it's just normal black tea I don't like
I actually do quite like green tea and herbal teas
I've never really liked potatoes either, in any form really
Sometime I don't mind certain chips but they're not something I especially like and would choose to eat normally
I still love a Sunday roast though, no potatoes for me but lots of parsnips instead :)
Just
Just don't.
I feel like punching someone and there's a 52% chance it would be justified
Ludicrous display
Ah no, never watched it
I don't mind a bit of TV sometimes
I'll have a look and see if it's the sort of thing for me :)
Cheers for the link
I think I'll check the series out
In English we don’t have genders, also a common saying is ‘the man in the moon’, so I’d assume it’d be a man
I think I sort of see how it might occasionally be personnified as female in a poetic sense but there's also the colloquial idea of 'the man in the moon' which would be in conflict with that
I think it's hard to say definitively one way or the other
Probably because of Britannia
I've noticed that before a few times as well
I don't think it's very common in regular speech, it's got a bit of an old fashioned feel to it, but it is a thing
Perhaps
The female personnification does have a classical kind of Roman/Greek feel to it to me which the man in the moon lacks
So you've got the two contrasting personnifications depending on the way you're looking at it
The British empire
As long as you were upper class
It was shit for everyone else
Probably late 1800s to ww1, the last 2 decades or so of Victoria and can’t remember who took over from her
We literally ruled the whole world and we’re by far the richest, most powerful country, it wasn’t really until suez that we lost it along with France
Big time
As another poster says, it’s amazing how many working class people view this as the golden age
I remember studying a northern city during the industrial era in history class, the average age of mortality in the 1850s was 20 years of age
We were shown a photograph of a 12 year old girl from later on in the century who’s shoulders were down at the same height as her chest due to carrying heavy shit around on them 12 hours a day, 6 days a week since she was 4 years old
Ireland was part of the UK back then, and when the potato crop failed in the 1840s, the authorities response was to export the rest of the food leading to mass starvation and emigration, to such an extent that Ireland is the only country in the world that has a lower population today than it had back then
It was the golden age for 1% and a bunch of gullible idiots think that means it was the golden age for the whole country
What
The Elizabethan era has commonly been refereed to as 'The Golden Age' for ages
This is all pretty much pre empire when the 'new world' was only just being discovered
Paris
Really ruined my expectations of the city
Beggars and thieves everywhere, can't go to any of the monuments or famous places without being hassled by people trying to sell you miniature Chinesium versions of said places
Didn't like the food but that's due to my own personal preferences and I can't blame the Parisians for that
Not really a horror story but I didn't like the city at all
I was fairly young when I went though, so maybe I should give it another shot now that I'm older and have a bit more agency over which parts of the city I visit
lol my dad did the same "there's some twat on the wrong side of the road
Oh shit it's me
Oh the french
Same, no one saying shit about England, that’s new
Using hotels and hostels as homeless shelters is very common in the UK, most councils do that
The thing people in Europe underestimate is that Brits are massive cheapskates when it comes to things like travel and food, I mean I've stayed in an EasyHotel (private double room with a private bathroom etc too) for £19 for one night in outer London, and while that's an extreme example, there's loads of cheap chains like EasyHotel, Travellodge, JD Wetherspoon etc
You can get nice hotels etc here if you want, but they'll cost you, and it's likely you'll get massively ripped off if you turn up on the day without a booking
The hotels that are used for the homeless are not always the cheapest ones either, there's one in my city that advertises at £80 a night that is actually only ever used by homeless people, but there's a good chain hotel that isn't, which is much nicer, nearby that charges £30-40
Not a city but the lake district is stunning
It’s normally only visited by english people though
> English ppl are cold
That's a stereotype
You can also get anywhere easily from London :) I agree, the rest of England is very underrated
Check these out  and
I have friends from other nations who really loved the rest of England and found English people very polite and loving
It's a shame people judge England for London which is a brilliant city but it's not a fair overall picture of the country
I disagree Windermere is always packed in the summer season
Id say some of the lesser known lakes and maintains in the lake District are less touristy but certainly not Windermere
Chester is very busy in the summer months with tourists, last time I flew back from Spain it was even encouraged to goto Chester on billboards in the airport with pictures of the streets etc
Sort if the same for Shrewsbury but not as busy
Telford isn’t really a tourist town at all
> Portsmouth, Plymouth
Those two dont deserve to be in that list IMO
Pretty sure they meant 'as a people' as in, we can be quite unwelcoming
Yes
A very common steryotype across the world
Like we're judgey and aloof
I live next to the peak district
It always looks really pretty in winter when it snows on the hills but not in my actual village
Great walks up there too
Tbh there isnt really anything in Telford for tourists although I like visiting for shopping as everything is central
The new buildings by Asda and Wilko are quite nice to go if staying overnight
Other than that its just a mirror of every other town minus the huge amount of empty stores
Don’t like the perfume they wear though
Bournemouth has a nice beach, and thats about it
I dont think tourists come here for our beaches
> The city itself is pretty nice
What
Bournemouth
What
I’m from England so I’m pretty lucky cause I don’t need to learn English, but I’d say Spanish because one of the places I could move to is America where obviously that’s really common, also actual Spain is another main option for somewhere to move to
Depends which country you’re working in, but overall I’d say Russian, French and Spanish
Not in England, but it should be the case
> Blackpool is apparently some sort of a ghost town and not British Hollywood as I initially thought
Im sorry what
Why the hell do people not from the UK even know Blackpool exists
> Germans and Swiss really are living stereotypes when it comes to giving overly detailed answers
Yes
I find it actually quite confusing when reading some answers here
Like I'm expecting to find some hidden meaning or explanation to something complicated because who would write 6 paragraphs on a simple subject unless there was a hidden message or something, but no its just a German explaining how they like to wear a hat
And Turks
Isnt Germany like the most popular country in Europe for Turks
Not that common anyone - i dont think
And only like super trashy chain nightclubs
Also, you never went to a nightclub whilst underage
Are you sure you're British
Im pretty sure they make pretty decent money tbf
Ah, how unsurprising
Boggles my mind why the west hasnt realised that you cant bring in people like Putin or Erdogan
They're not going to see our way of life and think 'oh that looks great maybe i'll stop being such a cunt' - They will always continue to be utter twats
Why must you Nordics be so happy
Save some for the rest of us
We've got quite a few but another one I don't see many people mentioning is Andrew Wakefield
He was the doctor who said that the MMR vaccine causes autism
Ask the rest of the country, it’d be Adolf hitler
For me personally it’s George V
If you base the most hated person in Britain solely by Redditors opinions it would be boris Johnson
He's not a national hero at all
He's seen as a despotic puritan who hated fun, banned christmas and was such a tyrant that the people welcomed a king back with open arms
Morgan is fairly reasonable and in line with the general public opinion on a number of issues
But he’s also just a total cunt
Undeniably a complete and utter cunt
A rude, self-satisfied, over-confident, privileged, ham-faced prick
Thatcher is like marmite - loved or loathed
I would argue that shes more hated than loved despite me being a cautious supporter of hers but she’s not the number one
Saville has to be in the top 10 of everyone’s list and that alone should be enough to be the most hated
Utter prick
Could William the Bastard feature
I reckon most of our population is too unaware of history to really hate him but they really should
They had street parties and bonfires and even paraded an effigy through the streets before lobbing her in the bonfire here in Yorkshire
Not that hard
English grammar is generally nice and simple
Accent is much harder to fake
The only non-native English speaker I’ve encountered who could do a legitimately passable English accent was a French girl I once met who spent years working on it
She was so glad that l was impressed
She said she worked really hard on it
ծ is /t͡s/, ճ is /t͡ʃ/, for English speakers ծ is similar to “ts” but pronounced as one sound, like you would “Ch” which is made up of “t” and “sh”.
ճ is “ch” like in “Cheese”.
At least according to the Wikipedia article for the Armenian language
In the world wars
The bbc allowed non RP speaking broadcasters because regional accents are just so hard to imitate
It’s really hard
English has too many accents, so we have to choose one first
Then memorise all words we already know in that accent and research thoroughly any new word we may bump into
I’ve been trying to master received pronunciation for yyyyears and progress is well slow
I’m an immigrant btw, I’m trying my best to adapt and become indistinguishable from a brit
But it’s hard to tell how far we get, since we depend on feedback a lot
We exist, don't worry
I'd say from learning Spanish for several years that intonation is definitely the hardest part of perfecting spoken language
I never noticed how flat English is when spoken, especially compared to Spanish
Yes i would love this to be standard
There have been so many efficiencies in my industry but we still work the same hours largely
I would be happy to work the same hours, 37
5hrs, each week but over 4 days
I’m an accountant, working the 9-5 life
Though it’s generally more than that
Having a 3 day weekend would be amazing
Weekend day 1 get on top of chores etc, weekend day 2-3 relax
I work a 7
5hr day and take a 30 min lunch break
So i work a 37
5hr week, but including the lunch break i would be at the office 40hrs
Can have an hour or more for lunch but would have to work until i hit that 7
5hrs
We are flexible though so i could work longer one day and finisher earlier another
General rule is we must start by 10am and earliest finish is 4pm
Yes, the French and Belgians for holding on long enough for us to get our army out of Dunkerque
You saved the lives of each and every one of them and possibly even our home
Thank you from everyone in the UK
The Irish for having to put up with us as neighbors
Thank you Norway for giving us a Christmas tree every year x
Big thanks to both Italy and France for the food and wine
Russia for being the bastion of revolution that started the Soviet Union which contributed so much to socialism
>Thank you Switzerland for being our second home for years
I'll also like to thank the Dutch for all your brilliant tourists in places like Switzerland, fantastic people to meet on a long hike or bike ride who are allways brilliant morale boosters
Last line of defence
Good old king billy
Oh for sure, reddit seems to think we have a Serbian-Albanian style hatred for each other
90% of users on r/Ireland are non-Irish trying way to hard to fit in
Always good craic when I've visited Ireland and most of us have Irish blood or relatives regardless
It's more our politicians and the nationalistic hooligans which are difficult to put up with
In the original comment you wrote Poland was the last line of defence
I'm not making some political point, it's just historically inaccurate to say poland was part of the battle of britian as poland was out of the war and under occupation
In the same vein Irishmen fought for the liberation of europe but ireland was firmly neutral
The servicemen should be proudly remembered of course but the nations were not involved
Haha, 303 squadron of the polish air force
Polish pilots, not poland
Historical inaccuracies are of course important
It's not a short cut, as it conveys a very obvious different meaning
Yes but if I try to sell my cheese as frnch when in reality france no longer exists and it was just made by a french dude, using British supplies, British kitchens, british bosses, british knives and British gas
I can hardly call
the cheese French can I? It was simply made by some french man
Who for all I know is a great chef
I dont think nationalities are official, I find that even more obtuse than the issue in question
It's just historically inaccurate to say Poland fought in the battle of britian
When they had ceased to exist as a country in that year
Okay let's make this simple, of course as a nation in exile they still existed
But as a nation in their rightful geography, capable of fielding a military, no they ceased to exist on that plane
If we compare this to Taiwan, in Taiwan with their Taiwanese military not counting their seat the UN table they still exist
however as the govt
Of China they are in exile and cease to hold their monopoly in that region
In layman's terms, poland has no guns, Poland was conquered, poland is gone
Polish people fled to britian and fought in the  British military
Yes of course
I am guessing it would be like the us and the U.K., Australia, Africa, etc
I’m not sure if English is weird or not for this, but I’d say I can understand perfectly fine someone from any country speaking English
That's remarkably close to English
I have always considered Dutch and English to be close relations
I understand some German too, and between German and English I can understand a lot of simple Dutch and Afrikaans writing
Spoken Dutch is harder, but when written down and read out phonetically, Dutch it often appears to be very heavily accented English
Daily because your government and corporations are endlessly trying to interfere with our lives (especially our healthcare) so US politics affects us
Hopefully when Biden is president we will get less
Because he won't make a fool of himself like trump does
Edit: Biden
God sake autocorrect
>larger than Andorra and the Isle of Man
the cool new metric
in the UK we used to use Wales for size, until they actually started complaining
Andorra is a good swop
Yeah, it was in the 00s i think but the term had been used since the 90s. Particularly with regard to deforestation
This lovely lot have flipped it on its head and protected an Area The Size Of Wales: “ An area the size of Wales’ is frequently used to measure the rate of forest destruction
Through Size of Wales, we are **turning that negative use of the country’s size on its head**.”
It was generally coupled with something depressing, so some of you lot said it wasnt welcome
I'd say there is more a of a Central/East/West/Southern/Baltic European identity
Some countries may belong to more than 1 of those areas
True
When I think of the standard "European" i think of mainly central Europe like France, Italy, Germany ect
I want to be included but I'm definitely just British lmao
It's like the old quote, 'America and the UK are two cultures separated by a common language'.
We focus on the discrepancies between us precisely *because* they are so small and specific
British people are honestly more similar to polish/greeks, the only reason people don’t think so is due to the language barrier
> Britain was apart of the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, which other European countries couldn't justify
But many other European countries could including Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Poland and I think Norway
I mean Ireland didnt even outwardly oppose the Iraq war and provided the US with airports for stopovers whilst talking about the need for good US/Ireland relations
Not necessarily overrated but London is the only city that really gets tourists
It’s overpriced, panders to tourists as well as the ‘British gimmick’ and is really crowded (still worth a visit though)
London is also barely representative of England and feels like a foreign country at times
You’ll get a much more authentic view of England if you visit other cities
I would say (kind of) the Louvre in Paris
Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great museum and a really amazing experience if you’re interested in art, but most people just go there to see Mona Lisa, which is the true disappointment
The painting is small and because of all the security around it you can’t even see it well, plus there’s a huge crowd surrounding it which makes you just want to see it for the sake of saying that you saw Mona Lisa and move on
Yep, I went to see it
Never been more underwhelmed
There are far more impressive statue and fountains really close by
Amsterdam wasn’t the prettiest city I’ve ever visited, but it was certainly one of the most fun
Define ‘better’
The only one of those cities I’ve visited is York, and
summer solstice festival is a pretty cool experience
I've been twice
A lot of the UK is like Slough unfortunately
I live in London and it is probably the best city on Earth
When I went to Germany in year 7 (or 8, not sure) we were explicitly told not to chant at any point "Two world wars and one world cup, doo dah, do dah
Wales and France
France and Germany
All of them
Europe lol
Little bit sad tbf
> I'd also point out that one of the most offensive British hand gestures is derived from showing the French we have two fingers to draw a longbow
Thats a known example of fake story
Like people will reference that story as something thats definitely not true but people once believed for a short while
Basically its an old wives tales
Essentially England and France meet up whenever their respective dysfunctional families start annoying them
I sometimes see Spanish people call us ''pirates'' online -- I wondered why and found out
Interesting though, because a lot of people here wouldn't consider Spain a rival
Ah yes
Geordies
Aren’t they they worst
Coming over here
Being all equatorial
God I hate them
why what happened
Hungary
Wtf
Because we really have nothing against the Dutch
Who hates the Dutch
Psychopaths that’s who
If you wanted us to stop you should’ve just said something
Friendzoned by Ireland, again
Probably because our tourists ransack Spain
The one world cup is referencing '66
It's the only football world cup final we've ever made it to I to I think, and we beat you (hence why it's referenced in the chant)
We recognise that the you've won several times, but not against us (although you've beat us in the earlier stages a couple of times)
I think only Brazil has had more success than you
The only thing that would have made '66 sweeter is if we had beaten France
To be fair, England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland are just one big dysfunctional family
I prefer Australian Champagne with my English Somerset Brie tbh
Who showers drunk
I once had to negotiate with an aggressively drunk flatmate who started deep-frying chips at 01:00 in a frying pan
It scared the shit out of the rest of us, but short of punching his lights out and tying him to his bed, he was going to get his damn chips
The rest of us intervened and took over actually cooking them in return for having some ourselves and not burning the block down
Definitely not
It's the last thing on my mind
I'd be too scared of slipping and cracking my head open
I know a guy (well, his whole family actually) who have chronically low blood pressure
My mum phoned him once and heard, "Hello" ***thump*** followed by 20 seconds of silence until he woke up on the floor
Standing up to answer the phone dropped him like a sack of shit
My very scared mother was on the verge of hanging up and calling an ambulance for him
Not a condition I'd like, for sure
For Northern Europeans the further away from 0 degrees and overcast the better the weather
Not necessarily
I hate hot weather aha, especially when it’s 40°+
French => English:
Travaille means work, not travel
Journée means day, not journey
Poisson means fish, not poison
Pain means bread, not hurt
Ennuyeux means boring, not annoying
And of course for the child in all of us, oui =/= wee
Those are a few I can think of off the top of my head
For some it's the pronunciation making them sound similar, for some it's the spelling
Edit: formatting
I quite like it yeah
Mostly probably because it's just what I've grown up with so I'm used to it but even so I don't have any problems with it here and no particular desire to move away
It's my home, you know, that sort of feeling
Whilst its not terrible and I do love where I live in a way, I’d like to move country outside of the UK if I possibly can in the future
Everything is just starting to bore me a bit, even if I haven’t seen everywhere in the country
Plus not vibing with our politics right now aha
Somewhere else, do I even need to explain
I like our actual country, the shit here, the people here, but if it was political, I would much rather live in anywhere else, probably somewhere like France or Spain
As soon as I’ve finished in school / am able to, i will probably move away, the only problem is brexit will have been finished by the time I can move, making it 10x harder
I’d love to move to Canada at some point (Toronto specifically) but I do love my home
I’ve always loved Canadian culture (especially hockey) and I love the weather and geography
They also have amazing people and good wages in the technology sector
It seems like utopia to me
Visiting Toronto was the biggest eye opener for me and made me decide I want a change in life
I love living in the UK but I want to enjoy life
I like it here but I want to move to Sweden , I don’t know why
You guys have a beautiful country too and unique culture, both of which I loved exploring
What stuck me most is the sense of community you have, at least that’s the impressive I got; visiting my then girlfriends family was a real pleasure and all the neighbours came out to join them for a BBQ
Haven’t felt that connection to my neighbours here in England, at least not for a quite a few years
pretty much the same here
Sounds rough : (
>  I don't like the debt culture
We have a debt culture
Good, we would have been conquered in ww1 and ww2 if we were in mainland, and us along with France and the rest managed to stop Germany from taking over the whole of Europe until America came in mainly because we were impossible to attack as we are an island
It is quite shit though how we need to take a plane / an expensive underwater train to go on holiday to another country, even island is unreachable by road
oh no he didn’t
That’s awful
Is Bulgaria better
Expensive too
There’s much cheaper cities up north where there is still plenty to do
One of the lucky ones I see, my brothers the same, he's a Swedish citizen now so will avoid all the shite we're dealt
Studying in STEM this September, hopefully I can land a place in the EU afterwards still
Failing that like you said, if Scotland gets independence I'd wanna get citizenship through my mum haha
I think that’s a very dramatic worst case scenario issue but I don’t think it will be as bad as you say it will be
Unemployment will rise a bit and maybe a slightly poorer economy but they’re the only bad issues I could see coming out of brexit in a realistic scenario
I guess it’s just time to tell us what’s going to happen
I remember there being a few around in the 80s, but they were definitely the butt of playground jokes along with Skodas and Yugos
They sold decently, being a cheaper alternative to the standard Ford/Vauxhall/Japanese saloons, but I don't think they were ever what I'd call popular
Skoda have come good - I drive a Fabia myself, which is basically a VW Golf with different bodywork IIRC - but Lada disappeared in the UK in the 90s. I think it was something to do with not being able to adapt to new emissions laws
What about that famous phrase ‘You’ll have had your tea
I moved from the UK to Portugal and it's *so* hard going from fairly standoffish greetings to the kisses
I keep forgetting, and then leave them hanging, or going for one when they mean two
A few times I've accidentally slammed my face into their face on the whip round for the second one
I got the hang of it eventually but it feels so unnatural
Love the Portuguese, and the country, but I got so relieved when I could meet up with English people and just do a quick semi-hug/handshake
My family always eats late (like 8pm or later) compared to everyone else but I don't really know why
Most British people at at about 6 I think
That’s weird
We don’t really do light beer here either, as far as I’m aware
Nothing compares too the school trip one
Nothing compares too the school trip one
oh, sweet child of mine
Naah it's super lukewarm
'Quite nice' is reserved for delapidated houses, and the first meal of your new diet
Hurrah for historical inaccuracy
As I recall Rapunzel's witch works out what's going on when Rapunzel tells her that her clothes don't fit anymore because her belly is growing
Boris Johnson would belly flop everyone there
An honest mistake
In the UK, cheers is interchangeable with thank you
In most countries on earth, it’s what you say before you drink alcohol
I distinctly remember saying salud to a Spanish shopkeeper, who’s probably staring at me like a madman as I walk out the shop with my purchases
Not sure if this counts as he'd lived in England since he was 10 but I had to dissuade a (presumably straight) Pakistani friend of mine from calling himself a "bear" in his Tinder profile
What height constitutes a mountain in the netherlands
From what I've read on here, what we class as a mountain is actually more generous than what most other countries class as a mountain
For me I distinguish between the words spicy and spiced
A curry with loads of chilli is hot and spicy
Mulled wine is spiced with cloves and cinnamon etc
American mustard is more vinegary than anything
English mustard would probably blow their heads off
Ah that's insane
I mean I think a height change would be a hill for me like a hill for me is a region of steep incline
I suppose 20m above sea level isnt high but it depends on how high above sea level the bottom is
Oh shit so 22 metre high is a mountain
I thought I was being generous calling the old man of Coniston a mountain when its elevation is 803m and prominence is 416m.
Ah shit I mean the Netherlands is le pays bas so makes sense
One of my biggest internal conflicts is that I am on a fundamental level a proud Englishman; I love English/British culture, history, food and drink, film and TV etc
There’s a lot of beautiful scenery and architecture here, and I’m so lucky to have been born so close to London where I now live
However, I’m also a generally left-wing liberal remain-voting European, and a republican, which is very much a minority opinion
My ideal for England, and the UK more broadly, may never come to pass, certainly not in my lifetime
And with Brexit I feel further from that ideal than ever
Genuinely feels lonely
I would say it's the English national pastime if it wasn't for those pesky southerners
Try a day out in a northern town
All in jackets you fairies
This is somewhat regional, but in parts of the North, men calling other men 'love' as a term of familiarity
As it is, a man will often call a woman love, like "thanks, love", or a woman will often call men or women love; but it's much rarer these days for a man to call a man love
It was more common in my parents' generation, and much more common in the generation before that
If I were to guess, it would be the growing acceptance of LGBTQ that caused a lot of men to essentially drop 'love' from what they would call other men as an implicit 'no homo'. When LGBTQ were just not talked about, then people didn't make that association
Huh, the name for that job in English is Tinker
They used to also mend pots and pans and stuff
Dead trade now, I think
Exact same situation here in Northern England, last decade or so the winters here have been getting more mild
However this year the temperatures plunged down to -10 and we've been getting a lot of snow, making me wonder if lockdown has effected air pollution enough to decrease the temperature
Yeah but you guys have also lost the hole in the floor style toilet in your campsites and service stations so its not all bad imo
My local chippy still does skin on fish
Sounds a bit like the UK, but in supermarkets
I don't get ID'd in pubs often, and never in restaurants - that is just not a thing
We have different laws for selling alcohol if it's accompanied by food
I still get ID'd in shops from time to time, especially if I am freshly shaven
It bothers me a tiny bit, but I understand why as the fines for selling to minors are very severe (up to £5000 fine or 6 months in prison)
The legal age to buy alcohol is 18, but many shops operate a voluntary "challenge 25" policy, which means they'll ask you for ID if they think you look under 25
Now, some cashiers interpret this to mean "Could he pass for under 25
", not "Does he look under 25
". Result: People who are around 30 like me, nearly twice the age necessary to buy alcohol, still get ID'd if they have a young face
Interestingly, now that we all have to wear masks in shops they seem to have stopped bothering to ask for ID
I like it when Northerners use the term 'duck'
I like it
I think we lost a part of our general friendliness in letting it disappear
I have the term 'toxic masculinity', but it does feel to be like people stopped using it because it sounded 'a bit gay'.
Yeah, super common in my grandparents' generation, less so in my parents', almost non existent now
Its 'me lover' where im from and that can really catch some off guard if they're not from the west country
That's kind of funny, considering the Soviets did the exact opposite with their tanks
I guess it shows where their priorities were
In the UK "pissoir" is occasionally used as a mocking, fake-posh term for urinals
Especially the nasty ones
Us English like using fancy French words for things
It makes us feel sophisticated
There is the occasional lorry trailer with a slogan or passage written on the side, left in a field on the side of the road
Truly though, the religious landscape here in Britain is both incredibly deeply ingrained, and subtle because of it
We are a Christian country and function as such, so overt shows of faith are kind of unnecessary
We don’t really have billboards, esp not on highways
The only religious banners I’ve seen are on or around churches
To expand we didn't have many religious billboards until a few months ago when the whole country started getting littered with: anti-choice, pro-marriage, pro-church adverts
Lol as English speakers we don’t have that ability
All of the closest linguistic relatives to English are mutually unintelligible
The only exception I can think of is Scots
I’m English and don’t understand anything but English, sorry
Probably french because we borrowed alot of words
I would say I could understand about 20 to 30 percent of writing in a french newspaper
As someone moving to the Czech Republic before Christmas, I was under the impression they were really similar languages (ignorantly probably) because I worked with a Slovakian woman who said she spoke Romanian Polish Czech and Slovakian just 'cos' as she put it lol
Kinda blew my mind when being bilingual as an English person is impressive haha
Edit: spelling lmao
100% it’s hard to know what language to learn however I’m trying my hand at Czech and failing miserably haha although still enjoying it tho
Yeah its very similar most adjectives will have the same prefix and the suffix with change dependent on time location and gender from what I can gather
Sadly there's no formula like there is in English to remembering them its a case of just practicing and committing them to memory which I'm finding an interesting challenge if I'm honest
(Sorry I'm no expert in language so not sure I'm getting the terminology right but hopefully you understand
Are the suffixes always the same
If so is there something similar I can use as a template to practice
I always find asking how native speakers were taught a language to really help the process along
Oh yeah haha
Before another Brit jumps in with; Us too yeah our love of tea etc etc
Coffee has fast become a competitor to tea, not saying tea is in danger of being forgotten but its strangle hold over the hot drink of choice in the office kitchen isnt guaranteed
As its mixed with milk the taste is weaker but you also drink it in larger amount as most people drink it from a mug
As we're a cold country for most of the year its more a drink to warm you
Yeah turkish tea is also drank a lot here
I could walk out of my house now and I would pass maybe 15-20 turkish tea shops before i got to a British cafe
And curry sauce
And mushy peas
I would say so, yeah
It’s just associated with racism thanks to groups like the National Front and the EDL, which is sad
Instead of refusing to let these groups claim the monopoly on patriotism, a lot of liberal, progressive English people just decided to identify mainly as British, handing the claim to national pride to racists on a plate
So now it’s mainly just seen during sporting events
I have several flags, but I am weird
Well, kind of, often its weird to see an English/UK flag flown in windows of homes or on the street, unless its a sports event, because unfortunately it has been associated with the far right and groups like the EDL
Not the U.K. flag, but the England flag in Scotland, for example, would be weird
Also a lot of people who use the English flags are usually racist, like the edl for example
I’ve never lived outside of England so idk about other countries, but they probably have stereotypes like that as well
As a country not having a flag would be weird but when you see flags outside peoples homes my minds goes to them instantly being a racist
Which is a wrong thing to do I know
During a World Cup you see a lot my flying about
If someone has an England flag outside their house, they are usually one of the 3:
-The EDL (Far right racist group)
-Old people
-Sports fans when the world cup/euros are on
Same here
This is the same in England
I think this is perhaps a projection of your own surroundings than the truth
I think if you come from London, Bristol, Brighton, Liverpool or (less so) Manchester you might believe the English flag is associated with racism, but then people in those places view a great many things as associated with racism
I think the notion of Englishness upsets these people, or the desire to have any sort of national pride is viewed as abhorrent
EVEN THOUGH nationalist politics and parties has never really been that successful in England
Compare that to the rabid and public nationalism seen in Scotland the last decade, with nationalist parties ruling the country, which is met with applause from people in those very same cities
Very strange
In the region's it's a totally normal part of English identity
You do have that massive Portuguese flag in Lisbon
It's huge, I've never seen such a big flag in my life
Same here in England
Disgaree, in England, especially with the St George's Cross, there's a class element to it, working class pubs will fly the St George's Cross all year for example
Middle and upper class people frown on it however
Me too
Unfortunately for me the English flag has become ugly by association
When I see it I think of ugly boomer art involving Bulldogs, and racist larger heads walking around with no shirt on
I’d rather fly a UK flag if I HAD to fly a flag
That or something kinda innocuous like the Mercian flag (someone is bound to tell me why that’s not innocuous) for a bit of a laugh
You can’t just compare groups that call themselves nationalist like they’re they’re different flavours of the same thing
The word is being used in very different ways
There is an obvious difference between the far-right ethnic nationalism of groups like the NF and the EDL and the civic nationalism of parties like the SNP or Plaid Cymru, which are essentially just using the word to emphasise their support for independence
And btw, I’m not from any of those cities and I know exactly how the English flag and English identity are weaponised by fascist groups and the far-right
Pubs only really fly the St George’s Cross because of sporting events
>There is an obvious difference between the far-right ethnic nationalism of groups like the NF and the EDL
The peak membership of the EDL was 25k - 35k. That's 0
0005% of the population
That's the population of England that has managed to hijack the flag apparently
>And btw, I’m not from any of those cities and I know exactly how the English flag and English identity are weaponised by fascist groups and the far-right
So you simply must associate the tricolour with terrorism then yes
Surely that's fair based on your criteria
>There is an obvious difference between the far-right ethnic nationalism of groups like the NF and the EDL and the civic nationalism of parties like the SNP or Plaid Cymru,
Come off it
You think the SNP don't use the same dogwhistles pandering to petty nationalism in the Estates of Glasgow
The civic nationalism bullshit is a pretty cover that makes the undercurrent of anti English nationalism that represents their vote outside of liberal city centres
It was at the top of one of the main parks
And it was huge, it looked like it was the size of a football field
Cause you can put whatever you think as your country's "values".
We are defending the values of Poland as a liberal, European nation
We are defending the values of Poland as a strong, traditional, independent nation
In England, there's parts of the country where you will see the English flag flown (not in Gloucestershire though, very middle class area that)
If you go to cities like Sunderland or Portsmouth, then you'll see it more
The number of England flags directly correlates with the number of Leave voters tbh
It depends what part of the country you are in
I know some pubs in Pompey flew it for Brexit, and some just leave it up all the time
Wait what
It was trendy to be British at your school
The rest of the UK has those problems though
Acting like England is unique in that regard and unique when it comes to racism is stupid
I took mine along with my british and european flag to two anti-brexit marches
I’m not going to let it be wielded solely by the worst of our nation
It depends where within Portsmouth, it wouldn't happen in the tourist areas or student areas (Southsea, Old Portsmouth, near the ferry port), everywhere else in the city, I've seen it around, Fratton, Hilsea, Baffins, Paulsgrove, Weacock Farm, Copnor, Eastney etc
Areas with a high amount of tourists won't fly it generally (unless it's Hastings or something), because the perception of it isn't tourist friendly, and the rich people who live in those areas don't like it, and students won't fly it because they mostly think its racist
I mean I knew shows like Sherlock and Doctor Who were popular in other countries too but I didn’t know that translated to people acting British haha
I respect your view point but I'd happily fly both personally, because I understand all nations have their fair share of racists and far right nationalists who have adopted their nation's flag
Many in which are active in their Parliaments and receive a fair amount of votes
I agree about the Scottish/Welsh flag point, but I'm afraid far right nationalism normally occurs in countries with higher populations
There's far right nationalism and the sort of cultural pride nationalism in most higher populated countries -- imo, I believe the English flag should represent cultural pride, not far right nationalism because a few nationalist parties that are barely active anymore adopted the flag some decades ago
That's how I view the English flag; it shouldn't represent the bad side of nationalism
My original comment was directed towards somebody claiming football hooliganism and drunkness is specifically an English problem when it's experienced in the whole of the UK
[Joke answer]
[More serious answer] - Also, obligatory 'this was likely staged' comment
This one is also pretty up there
Well the empire doesnt exist anymore so its not really represented by anyone living - Also *if* it was represented by anyone that would be the head of the state who is the Queen
Yeah as below said, need around on average a 2-3%/pa pay rise for *wages to be static*
That's a lowering wage, and it's happen all over
It's horrendous :(
I clicked on that thinking 'im sure its bad but it wont be worse than here in London'. Nope, that were disgraceful
Fellow yorkie here, govt neglect of our region aside, QoL I daresay is abit better up here for younger people due to the cheaper rent and housing market
My cousins down south in Hampshire would be paying £600/m in rent for a one bedroom flat with no garden or driveway, but still have the same wages as us
Hate litter too, also a big problem in South Yorkshire too, worst thing for me is heading out to a national park and spotting someone's one-use bbq dumped behind a rock or something
Reallllly boils my blood people have such disrespect for the environment, but are happy to use it for their socialising, cunts
Not really
I grew up in a house that was regularly bombed (its even one of the top posts on /r/history which was weird for me to see)
Everywhere I go is shaped by the Blitz; I now am sat in my London flat which is a block that was built after German bombs desimated the residential streets around here
But whilst my grandparents and great grandparents all fought in various wars i didnt, so I dont have that personal connection to war at all
I live in SW England, and there are remains of bomb damage visible everywhere, it has just been cleaned up nicely
Rows of houses often have a break or random newbuild slotted in
A lot of damage was caused by the council after the war however, just google Plymouth City Centre
In the uk we have lots of them
Pint being world famous, now only really used as a bar measurement
But my favourite one being a land league, the distance the average man walks in an hour
And it's a clever estimation measurement because its subject to change due to terrain and other factors
Never really heard anyone use it but I'm doing my best to bring it back
Penises are measured in inches not centimetres here in the UK
So we haven't gone metric on that yet, the traditional unit of measurement is still widespread and the norm in that area
You mean the thickness of a squirrel hide surely
We use metric for basically everything else as well though, everything else that is weighed is in kg except people
Yeah KG is mostly used by younger generations in my experience, also by anyone who spends time lifting weights
Actually I think anyone who competes in amateur sports probably talks about their weight in KG
I did read it wrong but not in the way you think haha
I thought you had wrote
" we have open palms with are the same length as 40 squirrel hides"  and I was thinking your finish hands must be huge or you've got it mixed up haha
Creating a rule of 1 wonder per country (mostly for France)
Westminster Palace (stonehenge is boring)
mont
Michael (its really cool)
Brandenburg gate (Mount Zugspitze was good too tho)
Colloseum Of Rome (Ancient, fits the criteria well)
John's Co Cathedral (Sistine Chappel 2
La Sagrada Famillia (Big dick energy)
Grand Palace of Brussels (Buckingham Palace Xl++)
I haven't travelled to very many countries in Europe (and even then, I've not yet had the chances to explore those especially thoroughly), so these are suggestions drawn from my limited travels:
**Man-made**
* Stonehenge, Avebury & Associated Sites (already a WHS) + Old Sarum and Salisbury Cathedral
* Gardens of the Palace of Versailles
* Sagrada Familia
* London Underground
* Venice
* Vatican City
**Natural**
* Santorini
* Northumberland Coast
* Snowdonia National Park
* Lauterbrunnen Valley
* Sintra Mountains & coastline
You ever been through the Chunnel
It's a great feat of engineering but definitely not a wonder imo
I think the large hadron collider isn't a great one just because it's not necessarily a permanent feature
It will stop being useful to scientists in the future if either someone makes a bigger one or they've collected all the data they can from that one
It is quite the achievement, true
Agreed
That it’s culturally significant and in many ways fascinating doesn’t make it a wonder; it’s a place of unspeakable sadness and evil
Reminds me of the architecture you'd find in the North-east coast of America
>there will be severe repercussions (mainly tutting)
Don't forget the slightly too loud passive aggressive comment from an old lady at the back to whoever she's with
Absolutely this
Queing is one of the best parts of our culture
It only takes a trip south of Germany to realise why
I saw street organs and thought the Netherlands had an open black market for human organs
Oh dear
I've seen full Blown rows over queing, also abroad I've seen Brits kick off with locals about it
It's about the most insulting thing you can do to a Brit, push in his que
Yeah American streets are more orderly for sure
There's a little bit or chaos in the one you linked, which makes it seem human
You can tell it was made before the car
Just looking at those narrow streets makes me feel cosy
Would love to see Теремок, in Russia, come here
Love their minced beef blinis
Non England/uk dudes, there's this fast food restaurant here called Nando's, it's Portuguese style chicken and it's hella good
They seem to be slightly interested in international expansion
I saw one recently in London
I still use my Yahoo email as my main address so no
Well, they fucked it up by ruining the sweep fiction and having infinite scrolling
I'm English and signed up to GMX about 5 years ago as a spam account, it's much easier to open GMX accounts than it is to open a Gmail or a Hotmail or whatever, it's my go to for when I need fake emails (used it for work once too, they needed me to sign up for a competitors email list under a fake address)
Just to confirm, I understand that your question asks should the European Union ban them at a supranational level, please correct me if I'm wrong
If so, no, it should be left to the national governments to decide
EDIT: Removed Edit as put it on the wrong comment
Hey, I still want to enjoy playing fifa and battlefield
Because the outcome of the loot box is a random number generator, like spinning a roulette wheel, will you get a glorious new skin, or a shitty weapon like a rusted spoon
You pay in real money, say, $3 or what-have-you,  and could get something absolutely useless
Because of the randomised nature of it, it would make it a form of gambling, hence why it needs the regulation
EDIT: as to the no intrinsic value comment, some games have marketplaces  where the contents can be traded for cash, or in game currency, which  normally costs real world money, ergo, it does have value
One thing I feel fairly certain of is it will be a lot more racially and culturally diverse and hopefully that will be tolerated and embraced
As Irish as Father Ted is, it was produced by Channel 4 who are a British pubic service broadcaster
The show is never not on TV in the UK and memes are also prevalent here
Fuck, why the Germans always first, and they are not even funny
Mostly the 'i hear you're a racist now father' being used everytime a Tory politician acts like a Tory
I’d say we have the closest ties with the US
We always make fun of America and it’s politics and say how we’d hate to live in a country with Trump in power but I feel like we get on with Americans better than any other nation
I feel like Australia and Canada could be considered the closest too but I feel like our political relationship with the US boosts it to the top
Britain, her wife Scotland, her former lovers Ireland and France, and her many children
> we are a lonely distant island floating around aimlessly in the Atlantic Ocean
You could say the exact same about the entire planet Earth and Humanity as a whole as it and we are floating aimlessly in one of the more minor spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy
But regarding Iceland don't worry bro that won't last because in the coming 250 million years Iceland will no longer be a lonely distant island floating around aimlessly in the Atlantic Ocean
as Iceland and indeed all the world's nations will once again come together, reform and join up, smoosh together again as part of [one giant continuous supercontinent] as the Earth's continents continually drift closer and closer together
Then we'll all be a huge island floating in a massive Pacific Ocean(which at that point in time will cover over 50% of the entire Earth's surface)
But you won't be alone anymore
I'm English and lived in France and I completely agree
I felt very close culturally to French people in a lot of ways that I wouldn't with the rest of the UK
I think that's because I feel slightly guilty about the English relationship with other UK countries
I feel really embarrassed about English politics for example
Scotland, Ireland and Wales all have their just reasons for disliking England, as does France, but France were also dickheads to us which makes me feel okay about it
There’s a reason Scottish surnames are so common in Jamaica
As a fellow Brit, no
I hate that being born in England I inherited this shitty, antagonistic relationship with a bunch of other countries and half the country seems dead set on pissing off as many of our neighbours as possible
It’s fucking embarrassing
As a Londoner
lol
England's flag is quite meh however the British flag is so much better
[I’d change the English flag to the Three Lions]
I wouldn't. I quite like it tbh
. I also like that  is similar
I‘d change it to my county flag, so the whole country is now goose land
The flag of St David was the old Welsh flag
Simple design =/= meh
You can't remove the Nordic cross
Because swedes will be swedes forever
Love it but it's a bit complicated
The best flags are ones that children can draw with a few crayons
Yours is okay cause its the original
But all the variations are boring
We all know that would not work
all the norwegian soldiers would go to system bolaget
Anyway, our border is closed right now because Sweden is scary scary land
even the border between Norway and the UK opened up
Yeah, i know
You'd be expected to chip in to help with bills
It's not like real rent
I'd expect most parents charge at least half as much
And it's only if you have a full time job and are a bit older
I live with my parents and am still pursuing a degree
I pay them £100/month to contribute to food etc which isn't that much tbh
In the U.K. it’s not normally that they charge rent
Most parents don’t, to me it seems sort of selfish and cruel to make your child pay money to live with you
The ones that do will only ask for a small amount unless they are total dickheads
At least that’s how it is in my area
Really
Iv lives in Yorkshire all my life and only ever heard it called board
Iv live In Yorkshire and was super confused with people calling it rent
Only ever heard board
Yeah it was board in the east mids too
Yeah i worked in Hungary for about 3 months a few years ago and honestly didnt pick up a single word
I honestly couldnt even pick out individual words from what people were saying
I also think the wide variety of accents from all the English speaking countries doesn't help
That’s what I thought when I started learning spanish
I wasn’t sure if the teacher was speaking correctly or if she had a speech impediment
Until a mexican friend of mine said all spanish people speak like they have a ceceo and that it’s normal pronunciation
I've always said it sounds like you're on a gentle roller coaster going up and down all the time
And Tolkien he was most heavily influenced by Old English as well
Although that Anglo-Saxon influence was not so much in the languages of Middle Earth but more so in the entire world and story of Middle Earth etc which itself is very heavily inspired by and based on Anglo-Saxon tales
He was a linguistics professor specialising in Anglo-Saxon England/Old English after all iirc
English is a real mashup of a language, but I was taught the basic of it was West Germanic, from those pesky Angles, Saxons and Jutes, as in people from Jutland
The thing that always surprises me is how little Gaelic there is in it
English directly descends from proto-germanic, just like any other germanic language
I wanna thank the Dutch for stroopwafels
They have revolutionised my cups of tea and coffees
They're up there with the chocolate digestive
Thank you France, Italy and Spain for all the great wine
I'm surprised noones said this, BUT THANKS YOU SWITZERLAND FOR THE ABSOLUTE BEAUTY THAT IS TOBLERONE
I'd like to thank my own nation
For all of its wrongdoings and fucky wuckys it did
It fathered so many great nation's, it bailed Europe out during the first world war, held stoicly in ww2, endured months of air raids and didn't break, it was the first major power in the west to abolish slavery, it defeated Napoleon and his regime, gave birth to the 3rd most spoken language on the planet, founded Canada, Australia and to some degree the us, so whatever your opinion of us, and no matter our wrongs,
Rule Brittania
And likewise here
Polish pilots defended our skies during the Battle of Britain, even after we hadn't lifted a finger to defend theirs
Polish soldiers parachuted into Arnhem to support our paras, even though they were supposed to be waiting to drop into Warsaw and even though the operation had already gone to shit
Polish sailors left their bases even before the shooting started to get to Britain and join in the combined war effort
For two years between the fall of France and the arrival of the Americans, Poland was our most steadfast and numerous ally outside the Empire
We may not have been able to stop Stalin taking the country in 1945 without starting WW3, but we didn't have to make them the only country in the world not to march in the big victory parade in London
We didn't have to forcibly repatriate the guys who wanted to stay here, knowing they'd be imprisoned as capitalist spies *at best*.
So yes, thank you Poland, and sorry
Thanks Finland for my favourite F1 driver Mika Häkkinen
Seconded
A genuine moment in history
Thank you for Hollywood
Dude come on, thanking ourselves
I didn't even know they existed, but I'll look for them
Thanks fren
- forever allies
You'd think 303 was the only Polish squadron in the Battle of Britain, but 302 were involved too, as part of Leigh-Mallory's Big Wing, while 300 and 301 were flying night sorties in *Fairey Bartles* bombing the invasion ports (which most people didn't even know happened at all
The definition of "socialism" in American politics seems to be social democracy, or really anything left of (and sometimes including) Obama
I facepalmed
Who else are we gonna thank
A frenchman praising our food
the apocalypse draws near
Doesnt Putin have a ridiculously high approval rating though
Isnt it fair to say the large majority of Russians agree with what he does and says
I suggest you actually read through this thread, mate
Yes, the Sabaton song does indeed, but just in general 303 get all the attention - understandably, they were right in the thick of it and became stars at the time too - at the expense of the other guys
But Russia are doing these things *now*
As a Brit, can I just point out here, the Dutch word for money is munnie
that is absolutely brilliant :)

That hurt :(
Loughborough :(
Luxembourg
Is not just a tax haven or something
Or is that Liechtenstein
I guess they probably have a couple of good looking towns or something, probably very peaceful
I imagine if I was driving near one of them I would likely take a detour out of curiosity but should I actually have some desire to visit
Albania is interesting for all the wrong reasons
Copenhagen is worth a city break
Understand where you come from but I think the highlands in scotland are interesting and worth seeing
> I also am a history nerd but I can not interest myself in English/British history
Bit weird IMO - We've managed to involve ourselves in the histories of most countries
I sort find it hard to make the argument of 'look our history is interesting' because there is so god damn much of it and its so world famous that i'd feel like an Italian trying to explain why their food is renowned, it just is
Are you also no interested in historic artifacts
Architecture
Art
Museums
Galleries
- Because if you genuinely have any interest in history then why wouldnt you want to visit some of the best museums in the word, for free
We def do give off a depressive vibe, its our forte but behind it is a sense of humour that makes us alright IMO
I won't argue against the depressive vibe because we are specialists in it and I know what you mean
But the history one I find a bit baffling
There's no way of saying it without coming off big-headed but modern world history kinda is British history
We're pretty much involved in everything that happened throughout the last 300 years
Does it not interest you how a little European island backwater came to be the sole world superpower that formed the biggest empire the world has ever seen and laid the groundworks for the modern world
Unless you just prefer ancient or medieval history
> but mountains without the sea is like having a soup without a dessert
Is this a phrase that doesnt translate into English or something
I am so confused
It sounds like you don't like the stereotypical middle-class "twee" British culture that a lot of foreigners latch onto
It is often a caricature and to be honest growing up as a working class person I struggle to relate to a lot of it
Tea is delicious though
I'm pretty sure every big western city in europe is a melting pot with such diverse cultures
What I once found really eye opening was seeing comments mostly from French people but a few other nationalities when the Tour de France once started in England they had *no* idea that Englands national parks look [like this]
> Colonial history of the Spaniards, Portugese and Dutch I find more interesting and the medievel history of England/Britain
It may shock you to learn this but the UK has a fair amount of colonial history
Vikings got away with all their shenanigans too
Boring ass Vikings
> Otherwise it's not particularly interesting to read about for instance how many Indians the British killed or how much they fucked other countries over, and completely got away with as far as everyone is concerned
Pretty depressing actually
How is this not interesting
You have India, an entire subcontinent filled with numerous languages, cultures and religions
One of the oldest civilisations in the world and one of the richest places in the world at the time
The entire subcontinent came under control of a small Island in the North Atlantic that previously was a relative backwater
What is more interesting, it didn't even come under control by military conquest at first
The spice trade brought young men over who wanted to get rich
One successful trip there and back, if you survived the tropical diseases that killed in their hundreds, would make you never have to work again
Black pepper was so valuable that people would leave Britain as nobodies and come back to buy themselves huge estates and basically buy themselves into nobility
There was so much money to be made that a private company, The British East India Company, literally came to rule over the Kingdom of Bengal
Imagine Amazon owning Germany to put that into perspective
It was only later that the government took over and slowly Indian kingdoms came under British rule
You can call it brutal and you'd be right, but that is the entirety of human history and I don't see how it makes it less interesting
> Maybe for a super small period
Is [100] years a small period
Compared to the Romans of course, but in modern times That's longer than the US has dominated
&#x200B;
>Yeah, because of Canada and Australia
>When I want to intrest myself in massive empires their are more intresting ones
England was lucky it was on an island, had just more population than the Netherlands and Portugal and it profited of Napoleons occupation of Holland
Only the conquest of India and the conflicts in Europe I find mildly intresting about english/british history
You can downplay it by saying Canada and Australia were big and empty, but even managing to own such big places uncontested points to our dominance at the time
Of course being an island helps, but being the birthplace of the industrial revolution was also a factor
London really is a different level to say Madrid or Berlin
Only Paris is comparable
It's a world city on the level of New York
I actually find woods an odd one as we dont have many woods
Most of our forests have been cut down to make way for those rolling hills of farmland
I would have thought the more common images would be seaside towns and the white cliffs of Dover
Than the largest, longest running, most powerful, still in affect to this day, made the capital city the center of the world, the reason we are talking in English right now, the reason English is spoken everywhere, the reason that English formal dress is the worlds formal dress, that colony
The single thing that has affected all of modern politics
The colony that is responsible for endless atrocities and periods of relative world peace, Uninteresting
Without the Spanish, Portuguese or Dutch colonies some parts of the world would be different today
Without the British Empire *all* of the world would be different today
I'm not saying it makes us interesting, I'm saying it makes British history interesting
The British Raj is British history as well as Indian history
Cool so the world speaks Dutch and wears Clogs
The Dutch were an origional super power
Amsterdam was a world capital
Radios play Dutch music and parliaments around the world are based upon the Dutch governmental system
The basis for the rule of law in many countries is based upon what the laws were in Holland
- Or is none of that true
The Dutch empire was a huge trading organization, was immensely wealthy but only ever *controlled* small areas
Its power was financial, pretty boring IMO
Its like comparing a cheque book with a WMD
To me it looks like you're reaching for reasons to find British history uninteresting because much of it is brutal
Like WW2 is super interesting, its the go-to subject for many an amateur historian, we dont claim it as uninteresting because millions of innocent people were brutally murdered
If you're upset that British people dont currently live in poverty because other British people born a few hundred years ago did terrible things then I hate to be the one to inform you that the world doesnt work like that and such views are ridiculous
> But this isn't what my argument was so this conversation is pointless
I just said your statement wasn't correct and you haven't given an argument to take that back
I have clearly given an answer to take that back
Look, here is a better answer; What language are we speaking right now
If you were in China and didnt know Mandarin what is the first language you would try and communicate in
What about India if you didnt know Hindi or Urdu
Or if you were in the middle east and didnt know any Arabic
Or in Africa and didnt know any of the many African languages, maybe French but if that didnt work
Would the answer ever be Dutch
If Holland was this amazingly powerful why does no one outside of Holland and some parts of Belgium speak Dutch
Is Dutch even taught as a foreign language anywhere
Speak to any random person in a former Dutch colony and show them a picture of Rutte or Willem-Alexander and a picture of the Queen, who do you think they would be more likely to recognize
The Dutch empire pales in comparison to the British Empire not just because of lack of industrial, financial, physical, or threat, just look at the ever lasting soft power the British Empire has installed
Still to this day a European country run by morons is seen as more than it is only because more than a century since it fell it still lays in the shadow of former glory
> WW2 is not simply British history, though
I also fail to see what makes British participation in WW2 interesting
You're missing a clear case of me making an example
> Otherwise it's not particularly interesting to read about for instance how many Indians the British killed or how much they fucked other countries over, **and completely got away with as far as everyone is concerned**. Pretty depressing actually
I'm not upset about anything
Are you sure
It can mean that in English too
It can mean that in English too

“It’s a long way to Tipperary” For some reason this song always resonated with me as representing the British spirit
However it's forbidden to play stairway to heaven in music shops

Also Holst wrote some beautiful music
Because it's overdone so the shop assistants find it annoying
Midlander living in London for 7ish years now
Assuming we’re disregarding the current situation, I love London
It’s a vibrant, bustling city overflowing with things to see and do
There’s fantastic architecture, food, art, museums, parks etc, the people are nowhere near as unfriendly as non-Londoners like to think they are, and getting around is (generally) very easy and straightforward
Is it expensive
Yes
It is worth it for me personally
1,000,000%. I can’t see myself living anywhere else on Earth
I live in London
I mean this is such a broad question, life for me is totally different than life for someone growing up on a council estate and equally different to someone growing up in a Kensington town house
I suppose I can only really answer what its like for me (middle class 30 year old)
Theres a great food and places to drink in London, also some of the worlds best galleries and museums, as someone who likes art and food this is amazing
I have a decent job and disposable income so I can often explore and appreciate what the city has to offer
London is very much a 'global city', this means about 50% of the population were born overseas, often this is a good thing as it makes the city interesting but I'm not gonna lie, some people do a much better job at following the law and making the city a better place than others
Theres a big Turkish community where I live and just about every young Turkish man drives like an absolute idiot, also the attacks on members of the LGBT community are not okay - I dont know why anyone would move to very liberal place like London and then be mad that there are gay people here
Like just about all Millennial Londoners am I sick to stomach about the price of property here, its just outrageous what has happened to house prices in the capital and its the single worst thing about the city which has many other problems like overcrowding, litter, crime, homelessness, drug abuse, traffic, pollution
All those negatives being said its still a great city, some parts are stunning, the architecture and the parks are amazing for such a big place
Most major city's have 1 or 2 nice parks whilst London has parks for absolute days
Plenty of Turkish people are also nice with good restaurants and great local Bakeries
being "sent to Coventry" makes a bit more sense then
Midlands erasure again

The classic one in the UK is whether or not someone says the word ‘scone’ to rhyme with the word ‘cone’ or the word ‘con’.
I say scone to rhyme with ‘cone’ because I’m not a disgusting subhuman
Is it scone or scone
Do you put the jam first them clotted cream or the other way round
People who take the tea bag out before putting milk in
And barbarians who leave the tea bag in and put milk in
I'm sorry but when you put the milk in absolutely matters and effects the taste, and of course it goes in second
Have been having a blazing argument with a colleague for a few years now about the cream/jam scones beef
They did, in 1991
Cakes and biscuits are taxed at different rates, so there was a tribunal between McVities and HM Revenue & Customs
> with the court finding in McVitie's favour that the Jaffa cake should be considered a cake for tax purposes
(for some reason a chocolate biscuit is deemed a luxury good and subject to VAT but a cake isn't.)
Cakes and biscuits are taxed at the same rate
Chocolate-covered biscuits are taxed at a higher rate iirc
I guess people like to argue about exactly because it doesn't matter, it's safe
You can have a passionate, heated argument about milk and know that when it's finished nobody will really care, but other subjects, especially politics, can be hard to come back from
That's it, I remember now
For some reason, chocolate biscuits are a "luxury" but cakes with chocolate on aren't.
IMO Austria is a small/medium sized country in terms of population and land area but, I dunno, it somehow escapes having a small country vibe and its just a bit of an unknown country - I say this as someone who goes to Austria every year as my Girlfriends family has a place there but still feel like Austria is just this total mystery
I have met far more Germans in Austria than I have actual Austrians
I think that’s more of a Scottish thing than a small country thing
Mostly on ski slopes

I'm in engineering and the only way we can get extra money out of a client if it's *their* fault e.g. if they add an extra requirement that wasn't included in their original tender, or change the material or design etc
Any other unforseen costs (like requiring more man hours than we estimated for, or material costing more than we estimated) are our problem and we have to absorb them
We stockpiling because of Brexit
Yes, went to the ATM at a Petrol Station today in rural Lincolnshire
A woman leaving the shop said to her friend "you can't even eat toilet roll". I've never seen it so busy
Ive never seen that much meat in my life before, holy crap
:O.. Im like where the fuck would that guy even store all that meat
, No home freezer can store that much(or in Poland do you have gigantic freezers
, im guessing not), maybe he must have some walk-in style huge industrial unit somewhere though
But still buying that much meat is crazy
It goes beyond common sense at that point, the expense alone must be insane
the hand gel makes sense
Lots of people have been buying it who wouldn’t normally and it does make sense to have some
Iv not seen anything missing from the shelves in England except hand gel
Its so stupid because we're nowhere near at that stage yet where you need to stock up
They haven't said anything about areas being quarantined
Even if they do you don't need 10 packs of toilet paper
Source
Everything I've read says it's mostly affecting the lungs
Also London and my nearest big Tesco had ran out of all pasta, rice, loo roll
Tinned sardines were almost all gone too
Everyone should have a stockpile before these events occur
I tend to over buy soap, but I have sensitive skin and a lot of the main brands make my skin crack and bleed
Not using them
What are you doing to need so many
Makes more sense to use them now
I like Russians dasvidaniya
its beautiful sounding to me
“Saudades” is a singular term for missing someone in Portuguese
In mandarin, the milky way is Ying He, or Silver River
Interesting
Thank you
So its a compound word
Anything with a hyphen: Lucie-Mae, Kira-Lee, John-Paul etc etc
Normal names spelt incorrectly: Jayme, Traci, Kaylee
Stripper names: Mercedes, Crystal, Lacey
There's some boys names that have connotations with being a Chav: Dean, Jordan (there are more but I can't think of them right now)
It’s a bit of a shame
I really like the latinised variant ‘Adolphus’. Not really an option anymore
Its kind of trashy here too
I was going to say
Kevin and Jason
Exotic
I mean at lease Jacqueline is longer and sounds a _bit_ more impressive
The seed drill and steam engine
Fuelled both the agricultural and industrial revolutions
I mean, England invented football, which is literally the world’s most popular sport
I’m pretty proud of that
Because you invented the metric system, we made it our greatest effort not to use it (and in some cases still not use it) for as long as possible :/
One of my favourite random facts is that Chupa Chups logo was designed by Salvador Dali
I'd heard it was an English man who invented the steam engine and James watt developed it further - fuelling the industrial revolution
So you sort of invented the industrial revolution I guess
Fair to attribute the inventions of the industrial revolution as British I think
Heading d’ya mean
The uk plug is objectively safer though
I always think it sounds like a weird thing that a bad author would include in a story to make the plot work better
Like the main character speaks English and everyone else in the world *just so happens* to learn English as well
Seems kind of fake to me idk
The positive is obviously that it makes life easier a lot of the time
Most popular films are in my native language, I can communicate easily with people from other countries (depending on the country), my language will always be catered for etc
A negative side which no one talks about is the scenario where you go abroad and want to go on a tour with a tour guide
Many of them will have an English tour guide, a French one etc
I feel like if you speak French, the tour guide is fairly likely to be a native speaker or at least more likely
Whereas because everyone learns English, the English tour guide probably won't be a native speaker
I guess it's worse if you speak a language like Finnish because there may not be a tour guide at all in your language but that's besides the point
Also, in museums and shit where there's some audio guide I often find the English recording speaks really slowly
Makes sense because many people will use the English one because the museum doesn't offer their native language but it's still annoying
Well, it's always been like that, so I don't find it weird
On the plus side, it's more convenient for travel
But I think it makes it harder for us to learn foreign languages
Our education systems doesn't put enough emphasis on it, and when travelling I feel embarrassed attempting other languages, because other people can speak mine so well
I suppose it is a little bit weird when you stop and think about it
In my day to day life though it doesn't cross my mind much
Whether or not English is the international language, I would still be carrying out my life here in English
I wouldn't particularly say it's a negative, after all it makes things easier for me if lots of people speak my language haha
A bit, I'm learning French at school, and it feels a bit pointless because as soon as we go to France everyone speaks English to us
No why would it be weird or negative
I suppose the only negative is English first language speakers e world over are shite at other languages
The Irish barely even k or their own language, the English are pitiful and so are Ozzys and yanks
Why would they bother
You call it lazyness but it’s clear the world over if your first language is English it’s u likely you will be fluent in another language
You can hardly call it lazyness
It’s just about winning the language lottery
I remember being on a school trip to Caen for GCSE french and evening tho we were staying somewhere made to teach English kids if they asked us a question and we didn’t understand they’d switch straight to English without talking slower or maybe using more simple language
It was quite frustrating
I'm northern so part of the problem I have with non-native tour guides is that they don't always understand my accent
So maybe that would be a positive thing lol
You only think it's easy because of how pervasive it is
In another dimension it's hardly spoken outside of England and it's a difficult little germanic language with strangers vowels and consonants and inconsistent orthography, somewhat like Danish
I don’t think you fully understand me
ALL The countries with English as a first language are terrible at foreign languages and quite clearly do well in other subjects so it’s not as simple as calling them lazy
Clearly there is another causation at work
Ozzie’s tried to hard to be british empire 2
0 so Canada had to be the favourite
It really is, wasn’t expecting it from people trained to teach Brits french but happened anyway
You started it
I still don’t think you properly understand what I’m saying
If you seee born with English as a first language you would very likely also only speak one language
But you wouldn’t though
That’s what you aren’t understanding
You wouldn’t be the same person if you were born with English as a first language
It’s like saying “I wouldn’t have fought in the nazi army, I would have spoke out against hitler in 1939
” Yeah I believe you
You don’t get it
Have a good day pal
I _still_ play the shit out Roller Coaster Tycoon
Did you know there’s a mobile version of the game called Roller Coaster Tycoon Classic
It’s the first two games in one and it’s incredible
Best video game mobile port I’ve ever played
Full of dozens and dozens of scenarios and works so well
I was genuinely taken aback by good it is
There was a hamster who got given a Viking funeral and they put him on a little boat and burned it down the river
Isn't that
disgusting
We are so hated
Same to me but Birmingham
I swear pretty much every working class English lad has at least one Irish grandparent
The people leaving nasty comments about us on here are a vocal minority, they hardly exist outside of the reddit bubble
Any time
Not really the point
Sounds like something you just read on reddit
I know Barr drinks are popular over here
They make flavours such as lime, cola, lemonade, cherryade, cream soda etc
They also make Irn Bru which is popular in Scotland, KA drinks that have flavours like black grape, pineapple, fruit punch etc
Other stuff includes the Simply Fruity, their equivalent of the Robinson’s Fruit Shoot which is popular with kids over here and Tizer
Probably shouldn’t speak for the country but I haven’t seen any Maltese in this thread
Kinnie seems to be popular over there, when I went there in December all the tourist boards were reminding us to pick up this drink before we left
Quite a unique taste, I preferred it when we got it in a pub because it came with a slice of orange that I think went well with it
When I went to Iceland I got a drink called Appelsin
I'm not sure if it's available anywhere else but I'm confident this drink is what the ancient Greeks were talking about when they referred to Ambrosia/Nectar of the gods
It’s kind of dead now but we used to have Tizer
I guess some people here drink the Levi Roots (Reggae Reggae guy) drinks
Lucozade is the best but you can get vimto and ribena in a can that are fizzy
I love mezomix
I like those Irn Bru fizzy chewey bar things
Do you think its because of how he perceived next to Franco (and to a lesser degree: Hitler and Mussolini)
Obviously there was censorship and a lot of other downsides to Salazar’s regime - but it never engaged in a White Terror as occurred right over the border in Spain
Is it a factor of: “Things weren’t great but they weren’t as bad as *gestures vaguely at spain* that”?
Glad you like English ^__^
Yessss I love Turkish tea
Rural people from the UK tend to be a lot wealthier than rural people from others countrys, probably because the UK is much smaller and you aren't as isolated from services and jobs if you live rurally
I'd say it's more that rural people look at people living in urban areas as being poor and stupid
Houses in the countryside are usually pretty expensive to be honest
They are normally old people though getting a retirement house
A lot of rural people are racists as barely any non whites if any live there, and the communities are small, some of them don’t even have internet, easy access to the rest of the country etc
Although nowadays probably avkut 90% of the population live in an urban environment
In england they are either seen as posh toff twats with too much money who are I to hunting and shooting g or poor uneducated country bumpkins who spend took much time abusing animals
I'm an english lad but spent most summers on my uncles farm in county galway and the dubliners got more stick than I did hahah
Theres a lot of working class that also live in the countryside
In some places they actually have really good community cohesion with the toffs
You would be surprised
Me too bro but I revel in it
Townies dont understand the country
Probably the July 2005 London Tube Attacks (7/7 Bombings)
If not that then the 1984 Brighton Hotel Bombing where the IRA tried to assassinate the UK Cabinet, including PM Margaret Thatcher
If we're talking accidents then the Flixborough disaster in 1974 when a chemical plant blew up
There was a larger one but I hadn't heard of it until just now when I was looking up the dates of these other ones
In 1944 an RAF (Royal Air Force) munitions depot exploded at RAF Fauld
[It was the largest to ever occur on UK soil
Not sure exactly, maybe 7/7, the Manchester Ariana grande bombing, the ira, there’s been a few
I’d say in modern times the most talked about is Ariana grande, but overall probably the ira because of how much death there was for all that time
who doesn't tbf
stupid, sexy Deutschland
Was that 'nice'?
I've always thought of the Irish as being more passionate, easy going and funnier than us
got a lot of love and time for the Irish
every single Irishman I've met has been good fun to be around
can't wait until i can pop over for another visit
Englishman with an Irish boyfriend here
He’s way hotter than me
I guess you guys have to do something to entertain yourselves when everyone else is competing
it's this attitude that makes Germans so respected
especially in comparison to my country where the darker parts of our history is either ignored or (more disturbingly) actively celebrated
I love milk
Especially the unhomogenised stuff
I used to drink a lot of milk but have since gone Vegan so I don't drink it all now haha
I have Soy Milk in coffee and with cereal but the consistency of it is a bit too thick for me to just enjoy a cold glass of it
I prefer water these days
I was looking for this
Very horrorshow indeed
I agree when I went to Poland I noticed the milk tasted especially good too
Huh I do too
In english we have "the arse end of nowhere
A rabbit snd and hare are not the same animal
France gets credit for their amount of cheese but England has so many more variaties
It's not really something we think or talk about tbh
By plans for switching I assume you mean the government changing road signs to metric, for example
IMO it would be a huge waste of money for no gain, and would just confuse everyone
The culture, sure
But we have pretty much the same claim ancestry-wise
Most English people have very high proportions of Celtic DNA
“UK and Europe”
Gym weights are pretty easy to convert and most people learn both especially if exposed to American YouTube and such
Looks like a stool sample i had to give a few months ago
London has quite a skyline now, but it’s because we don’t want the view of historical buildings to be clustered with skyscrapers
We started building (small) skyscrapers in my hometown and it just looks like shit
It makes sense in somewhere like London
Not a suburban Surrey town
Depends on the terms/phrases
For instance, it makes sense for an American/Canadian living in the UK to say ‘pavement’ rather than ‘sidewalk’ etc
Probably just easier for most people to comprehend
But hearing them say things like ‘wanker’ or ‘bloody’ just don’t sound right in a North American accent
On a slightly related topic, if I, a Brit, where to go on holiday to Austria and speak German German, for it is the only German I know, would it be insulting
We call them bum bags :)
Why the rest of the UK seem to hate us but we like them
Kind of like how England thinks there's a rivalry between us and Germany but in reality Germans don't really care about us
(As far as I know)
Lol pretending the Welsh dont do this to some ridiculous degree during the rugby
Booing whenever an english coach or player is on the big screen, booing kicks etc etc
And its not exactly arrogance when we shit on our teams more than anyone elses
I was in Cardiff during the last football world cup and would see huge numbers of Welsh guys purchaing the shirts of anyone England was playing
You're more likely going to find English people supporting Wales in the football than you would supporting anyone Wales was playing against
You’re kidding me right
Wales were talking _mad shit_ at the last Euros
Why do you always act like we’re the only ones do that
Not to mention ABE
and _we’re_ the arrogant ones
So ridiculously un self-aware
Honestly mate you've hit the nail on the head and put it how I couldn't. It's almost like if everyone thinks we're cunts, then we might as well give them what they want and be as obnoxious as possible
It's a big country little country thing
I see it with Austrians and Germans
Smaller counties are allowed to be nationalistic and mock the bigger country, but it's not seen as arrogant because they're the smaller country
In a way that is an arrogance
It's not exactly unique to us
Everyone else on earth does it too
Because we have massive expectations as a country
We have the best league in the world, produce world class players and even invented the game yet our international record is underwhelming
Its frustrating
We say that all the time because we invented football and it’s a funny song
We don’t actually believe that we’re going to win literally every competition (we’d have to win at least one first)
Literally nothing wrong with this
It's been our football song for 24 years
Yeah most of it is probably due to media
Wish it wasn't that way though I like how we're all unified
There are definitely a vocal minority of people I've come across who have been pretty toxic because I'm English
But everytime I've been to Wales they're a lot friendlier than anywhere I've been in England
Never been to Scotland but presumably it's the same
That just proves my point
Presumably it started from both the wars but in football seems like we always lose to Germany in important matches and vice versa
I think most English people see it as a friendly rivalry though nothing too serious
It's both though
The song is ironic and even has us losing at the end
It's about disappointment
But when we got to the semis of course we believed
Yeah and everyone is always so nice and cordial towards England
Because it’s specifically directed at us
Like, explicitly
Maybe that’s why
I agree with everything you said
Each cuisine has its own "grammar" and its wrong to judge one cuisine by the grammar of the other
With regards to Indian food, he can't taste the spices because his palate hasn't been trained to
Indians have grown up eating all those spice combinations so they genuinely can identify all the different spices in a masala
They might think Italian food is bland, but they would be wrong to think that because they'd be judging Italian food by Indian standards, just as its wrong to judge in the other direction
Its a sad mindset to have because you're limiting yourself to so many cuisines that are all right in their own way
Lol like I give a fuck after a comment like that
Xenophobic turd
Very typical
I’m not beholden to your moving standards
You call us arrogant knowing full well that unless we all just roll over and agree with you you’re going to claim that as proof
Disingenuous nonsense
How do you think people should respond to bullshit unjustified xenophobic twattery
Tit
I’m starting to think you don’t know what the word arrogance means
It’s not arrogant to have a negative reaction to some spreading bigoted lies
I’m pretty sure hoover was a brand, everyone calls vacuum cleaners hoovers
Also sellotape
I had no idea it was a brand
I find it funny that you used the word ‘sharpie’ to describe a highlighter
Another example of brand dominance in English lol
Fanta is an orange flavoured soda in many other places, what flavour is it in Turkey
Or, you know
just short for 'refrigerator'.
I see, thanks for the reply
I was at a zoo looking at the gorilla's and a little boy asked his father what they were and the father said "I dunno, I think they're some sort of monkey
Not about someone else but once I went to Canada and i was in the cnn tower
there was a sign which said we were 561ft/pi above the ground so I shouted we’re 561 feet or pints above the ground
I got a lot of stares
Not going to even pretend to not know where those lads came from
TBF though, living in London you see people from all over Europe acting the same way here, doing coke openly in pubs etc
Maybe I'm just a scaredy cat, but I see way too many tourists being dumb on dangerous ledges
The worst was in Budapest, where I saw a family posing for a picture on one of the bridges, and they had a toddler stood up on top of the wall
It's one thing for an adult to do something like that, but a toddler doesn't understand the potential dangers of doing something like that
I did that accidently a few times there
The bike lanes are pretty empty here, so I'm not used to watching out for bikes
There's also the usual European hazard of the all the traffic going the other way as well
So I was either forgetting to look for bikes or looking the wrong way for them
When I was in Copenhagen I tried to be cognisant of the bike lanes
but I'm from a country that has barely any and was in a city that's full of them
Think I may have gotten in someone's way a couple of times
I definitely did this in Valencia’s parks a couple of times
Not used to them in the U.K. but after the first couple of errors I was fine
But surely by her own logic her ability to speak French would mean that she could also understand Spanish
The top of a mountain is one of the places that I would least likely to be pissed at
They have a good point to be fair
It was Howletts Zoo, in Kent somewhere
Shamefully, this was an English person
As with others, it looks like, you sometimes hear "the provinces" - I've encountered it particularly in theatre, where if it's not in London it's "provincial theatre" and looked down on
"The Shires" is sometimes seen too, usually indicating a rather twee, cutesy countryside image: the Cotswolds is "the shires", Barnsley is not
Derogatory sense, ‘cunch’ meaning countryside, young people in London say this as an insult when someone uses slang wrong or just pretends like their a gangster when there not, a lot of people above 25 wouldn’t have heard it before
It originated when gangs from London started ‘county lines’ which is sending teenagers from their hoods ‘ot’ (out of town) or ‘to cunch’ basically mainly counties around south east London to sell drugs for more money and with less risk of police and rival gangs, for more money
But yh nowasays it is mainly used by people from London who want to feel like their better than everyone else because they are in the capital
Wow we use hinterland in English too to mean sort of very remote wilderness
Wow that’s actually quite mean
You learn something knew every day
Barnsley is actually pretty beautiful in some parts
I took the dogs to Wentworth castle at the weekend
Beautiful
Being called the north is a privilege and not derogatory,the cheek of these fucking southern fairies
"London bubble" springs to mind
Can you give an example of where this is used
I’ve never heard this before in my life
Oh, don't mean to dunk on Barnsley - if it's in Yorkshire it's all reet in my book
Just doesn't fit the image of "The Shires".
What do you mean by Greek everywhere
I've only seen one so far from my experience
I didn't know there were so many nationalities in London
I think British people generally dress quite revealing in terms of their clothing on night outs
Even in the winter or when its snowing
I don't know why this is, but I have heard somewhere many years ago on an article that this came round because Britain is a less Conservative country socially compared to the rest of Europe
Dressing oddly is probably far more accepted in Britain (and Ireland) too
Probably because the UK has school uniforms in high school, do bear that in mind
Thats true - but equally if you are flying from the UK to Southern Europe, or at least Spain, Italy & Portugal; half the time the border guards don’t bother looking anyway as long as you are physically holding a passport as you walk by
I say this as a white man, i hope its no different for people of colour but i would not be surprised if it was
Go to Gibraltar man - it’s basically the lingua franca
Is it a myth that French motor insurance specifically excludes the Etoile unless you pay extra
Aubergine is my favourite
We even say it with french pronunciation
I read somewhere that English doesn't so much borrow words from other languages as chase them down dark alleys, beat them up and rob them of anything of value
I’ll do this three ways: recognised regional minority languages in England, recognised regional minority languages in the UK and languages in general that aren’t recognised (ie languages brought over from immigrants or languages as part of a religion etc)
In England, I’d say Cornish
The UK I’d say Welsh
Excluding recognised languages, I think I read somewhere that Polish is the second largest language spoken in the UK
Tbh as someone who's 18 I don't really understand how someone similar age to me could be so incompetent with computers as people on this thread are describing
People forget that I didn't have a smartphone until I was around 13 and even then I barely used it
I spent most of my childhood using computers rather than tablets
I just wonder if it's circumstantial
Maybe some kids got smartphones earlier and didn't have a computer at home before that
Maybe some didn't have good IT education at school or didn't listen
How
Did you never have to use PowerPoint for school
I feel like most of what I learnt about computers in terms of basic functioning was due to having to use programs like PowerPoint and word for school projects
We were also taught how to use them at school
I also took computer science at school where I learnt more but not really more about using a computer, mainly about how a computer works and computer specs and what they mean
I suppose it depends on the education system and the school you went to
But for me it seems hard to understand how someone wouldn't have ever had to use PowerPoint or word for school projects
And when I used them at those times, I found out about new features just by exploring, the layout is pretty intuitive
Very very common
I have a fairly diverse group of friends and family, and most smoke or have smoked
I’ve encountered smokers who were middle class parents/grandparents and “well respected in the community” types (a mayor for instance), at parties/gatherings used like alcohol, 20-somethings of most backgrounds, people who are married to police, the list goes on
And for diverse reasons too: physical illness, chronic pain, mental health, to unwind daily, just saved for special occasions, when doing a specific activity (art, movies, hiking)
or just to chill and be lazy
In general it is just very common and not for any one reason, and seems to be popular in most demographics for one reason or another
Anywhere between like 10-25, has probably had it in the past year
I know it’s young to have it, but probably like 80% of people would’ve had it at least once in their lives country wide
I’m one of the only ones my age (14/15) who hasn’t had it, and some people have it daily
A lot of older people think weed is awful whilst they snort a line every week, or inject heroin into their arms
Huh, I never really thought of French Polynesia as a hub for weed
>50-70 : „wheeha, finally my nephew brings in the good stuff, light it up like it’s 1969“
Does that attitude still hold in Eastern Germany
Ahhh yes we do that too
I have an Anglo surname and its spelled like 5 different ways
If you ever have any doubt about the quality of English on the sub, pop over to r/ukpolitics and see what horrors native English speakers can inflict
Standards here are high, it amuses me no end when a poster writes not just grammatically correct English, but good prose style and ends with 'please excuse my English'.
It's really good
The majority of the time I wouldn't be able to tell they're non-native
Occasionally there are mistakes of course but on the whole it's pretty flawless
Mostly great but sometimes a little off and I never know if its rude or helpful to correct someone
The level of English here is very good indeed
Embarrassingly so
Rarely do I see mistakes
I don’t think I could identify any frequently-made mistakes
I’ve noticed not just here but across Reddit, people constantly write ‘went’ instead of ‘gone’.
I.e. I should have went that way
I love how Portuguese people say codfish
To any non-native English speakers reading
Does English sound like a Germanic language to your ears
, And do you hear any similarities between English and other Germanic languages
, Also as a non-native speaker what did the English language(and the English accent) sound like to you before you learned English
I can't see any comment here referencing /UKPol
Seems like you've inserted that one all on your own OP
Seems like you had a conclusion already
Why would we write like we were writing English language essays on a native English sub
Just nonsense
People typing on their phones type quickly, people showing off their English skill want to be meticulous
It's*
How did you manage to support yourself during the degree if the UK govt doesn't provide assistance
That scarpered my plans of study in Sweden in 2017 when I realise student finance England doesn't lift a finger for its students abroad
My brother in Sweden only managed to do it because he got his citizenship first
I've grasped Swedish fairly easily when I put a few months into learning it, is the transition from Swedish to Norwegian particularly difficult for a native English speaker
In uni in England atm, but one of my plans is to move over to either of the nordic countries once I've got a bit of post grad experience
Good on you mate
My ex was also Finnish, stupidly we ended up I England for a year before we split (met down under), but she was adamant she didn't wanna do Finland
Shame, I could be nearly 4 years in towards attaining citizenship at this point
Yeah
My options have been utterly obliterated thanks to brexit, so it's a must i take on the traditional UK student loans to get where I wanna be now, such is reality
Edit: I might add I'm studying for my bachelors in software engineering, so I'll be in a great position to relocate after my first grad job, I'm confident :)
Yeah that's my assumption too, one of my Norwegian mates I travelled with I found hard to grasp most things he said when speaking Norwegian, Swedish however I find much easier
Is that a Finnish compulsory requirement for EU citizens is it
Aye Swedish is only really used on the west coast from what I believe
> (normaltrack/broadtrack/metertrack/narrowtrack)
We use Standard gauge, broad gauge, metre gauge, narrow gauge
Broad-gauge track was only used in Britain by one railway company (albeit a big one) for 20-30 years in the 19th century, so you have to be a real rail geek to know of its existence
Likewise,
I've seen it rendered as "Iron Way" too
Longer than I thought then
But still a lomg time ago
And then started to be converted to Standard from the 1860s with the last bit converting in the 1890s, by what I can see here
Yes but you need a boat to cast yourself out into the sea
I think you would need a submarine to find unspoiled "wilderness" in England and the UK
Our rate of forest cover is comparable to Mali and England is a very dense nation just as Bangladesh so there's a tiny amount of scattered ancient and young forest remaining
Personally I'm okay with it but I do wish we'd make some efforts to reforest even our small areas of moorland and in particular green the Midlands and North of England
If by head of state you mean political leader then you should know our current Prime Minister  *was* born in another country
It would w a shocker and would involve the death of lots of royals
Head of State
Never going to happen because Monarchy, unless it was on a trip, but even then, unlikely
Head of Government
Boris was born in New York, nobody cares
I’m honestly not trying to antagonise you or be woefully ignorant
Not at all, boris Johnson was born in America, and the only people who hate foreigners are his own party
Why would it be held against them
It would b upper controversial because it would mean that lots of royals were dead
Didn’t The Irish govt
relinquish claims to NI as part of the GFA
He is british though
I don’t think he’s ever held an American citizenship or dual citizenship
He hasn’t ever paid to the IRS
Just his birth that was foreign
there is German heritage, but the last officially German member entered the royal family in 1840 (Prince Albert who married Queen Victoria)
here's a nice article
Yeah, but still part of the “actual/legit” UK I guess and over half identify as British and it’s physical part of the british isles
Not a complete outsider
Born in Britain to an English father and Irish mother
Also Lived in the republic for 3 years
I understand it’s not that simple as its british but the the majority of the population wish to remain a part of Britain and that should be respected Until it changes
But currently it is 100% British
Canada isn’t part of the US even though it’s on the North American land mass
THe people of NI have a choice of citizenship and I respect that
But the country is british no matter your political aspirations
It’s physically on the island of Ireland
This means less than nothing
Because I’m right
I wasnt quoting
I was providing my own quote but using your logic
I’m glad you realise how silly it sounded
You are claiming that in the history of the world up until modern times there has never existed and island containing one or more nations
Hint hint there’s a triple next door, also the Iberian peninsula, also the Scandinavian peninsula, Guinea island, the list is endless is even from modern times
There’s also plenty of modern states in stupor that have no natural defences on their borders , The Netherlands, Belgium just for close examples
Also to add to that
Why would natural defences even matter anymore unless Ireland was planning some kind of attack that we all know would end badly
Yeah a province technically that is true but it has the status of a country
Yes it’s clear that one day the majority will indeed change
And allowing the vote is won and the republic can guarantee that they will be able to keep the peace then I will be pro UI
I’m really not mate
You just don’t like what I have to say
I even support a UI as long as the majority of the population of NI vote that way and the republic can guarantee the safety of everyone and don’t plan to make unionists second class citizens
I feel the same for any british territory/country/province Including the Falklands which is 100x simpler than NI because all the population wish to be british and Argentina never held the Falklands
Yes your by you are taking about the formation of borders 300 years ago and it’s losing relevance by the year
Of course but particularly between peaceful nations that is growing less important ever year
American and Canada for example
Many other modern European nations
You would have valid point if both the uk and Ireland were expecting war and lithos happened 200 years ago
Good point however britian is perfectly happy to make these sacrifices to keep the people of Northern Ireland safe
Personally i think all the newspapers except maybe the Daily Mirror and sometimes the Guardian are pro-Conservative Government
In the U.K. we have newspapers like the sun and the daily mail, which are very conservative that the left fears, and the actual government rn I don’t think there are any that they fear
All of them suck up to the government

Utter bollocks
Unsubstantiated cliche meant to play to perception
Definitely not France
The germans, we both hate the french
(In my eyes anyway)
Yeah we hate England too
You guys are just salty because we've both defeated you, and saved your nation in the space of 200 years (Anglo gang rise up
We have a way of making other countries friends without making any ourselves
Except maybe Portugal and the USA
I feel like two rather large wars may have put a hamper on that
Damn Scots
They ruined Scotland
>our colony
You guys literally ceded Normandy to the Vikings, so if you wanna play that game, were a colony of the Vikings
There’s a brand in the uk called superdry (I don’t know if it exists in other european countries)
A lot of their clothes have Japanese  kanji characters on them I speak no Japanese so I don’t know but I’d bet they’re just random letters and words that mean nothing in the language but look cool to western eyes that aren’t familiar with them
I’ve heard in Japan they have the exact reverse where Japanese people who don’t speak English wear shirts with words like Milk on them
It's not even that new - in 1990 the travel writer Bill Bryson complained about it in *Mother Tongue*. In a section on "Engrish"
> I recently saw in a London
store a jacket with bold lettering that said: "Rodeo - 100% Boys For Atomic
Atlas". The jacket was made in Britain
Who by
Who for
I propose we send a load of t-shirts to the US with 'Podlasie' on them to see if they buy anything
You say that like it's a bad thing, but i really dont think it is or should be, it's not really that much more weird than wearing something with checkers or something, in lieu of some plain block colour of shirt
Not everything has to be utilitarian and sparse :)
So everyone thinks their national sense of humour is ‘dry and sarcastic’, got it
I wouldn’t call Brendon Gleeson a comedian
Are the dark jokes seasonal by any chance
True but a joke like the one Wolff_house posted wouldnt be acceptable in the UK
No worries mate
First think that pops in my head was when Gordon Brown had his TV mic still hooked up and started ripping into that old woman that he’d just had a chat to, proper cringe
Edit: [Full video]
Watching people fainting is so so scary to me for some reason
Chris Grayling
How on earth is he still a minister
Either jokes about the government or Brexit and weird newspaper headlines
people in the south are posh and Americans are idiots
We have a similar thing with a sofa store DFS
There's always tv ads about how the DFS sale is ending soon, but it never does
Tbf our government and the British people as a whole are historically known for carrying on as normal during crises, but fuck do I want a week off work
Probably that too
But really, he's just hugely incompetent
And considering our Government that's saying something
I don’t keep an active eye on other country’s politics but i’m always interested to hear about France, Ireland and to a lesser extent Germany’s politics
Mainly as I like to visit those countries the most
Not even interested in my own country's politics anymore let alone anyone else's.
I don’t know about place but The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town, he’s enough to put the shits up anyone
Really fuckin popular
When I was a kid it was the norm
I think kids now drink less and take less drugs
Lmao no they would just not sell it to you
There are 2 main parties in the uk - the conservatives, and the Labour party, but their are about 10 if I remember correctly, ranging from green, to ukip
Everything in NI is a but more complicated
The whole country is working on about 80 layers of nuance
TV License
You can easily get away with not paying it, but I think its important to have  channels that don't have advertising, and I think the BBC makes a lot of important programmes
From UK perspective
Normally you have: First name, Middle name(s) (optional), Surname (family name)
So you could have John (first name) James (Middle Name) Smith (Surname)
Your surname is usually the same as your father's, but there's no legality to that, just convention
You could take your mother's or take both, which is called "Double barrelled".
You could also be passed on a double barrelled surname which is not your two parents' surnames
For example, Daniel Day-Lewis; Day-Lewis being his father's surname and not a combination of his mother's and father's.
Technically you can have more than just two surnames with there once being a family with a quintuple-barreled name
But double-barrelled is the most common
Somebody's first name can also be hyphenated, such as Lily-Rose
This has definitely got more common in recent years
I don't believe there is a limit on how many middle names you can have
Some people have given their children the names of all the players in their football team
So, if you were particularly unlucky, you could be
Tyler-James Pickford Pope Alex-Arnold Chilwell Gomez Keane Maguire Mings Rose Stones Tomori Trippier Walker Alli Barkley Dier Henderson Maddison Mount Oxlade-Chamberlain Rice Ward-Prowse Winks Abraham Hudson-Odoi Kane Rashford Sancho Sterling Wilson Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville
Jewish people are spread throughout the western world and have significant integration, influence and power
Congolese people aren't comparable in this way
I think because of the setting also, they're not comparable
The Congo atrocities went down in Congo, not in Belgium, so it's not the same as with Germany when shit went down literally in front of the eyes of the people
Working on a cotton field
Probably working in the coal mines in Northern England, so that's fun
I died 14 years earlier
In the caribbean
Of course
The world needs to stand up to the CCP’s threats
Thanks
I grew up thinking Father Christmas lived in Lapland or Greenland
Edit: spelling
the “north pole” but the exact location is usually lapland
According to my tradition and my own research in partnership with The History Channel etc
What we refer to as Santa Claus is not actually of this Earth, it's an extraterrestrial shapeshifting being of pure energy who came to Earth many millennia ago before recorded history, it's origin is from outer space somewhere beyond The Kuiper Belt and deep into the Oort Cloud etc
But it's last known residence before arriving and living on Earth is theorised to of been the Jovian moon Callisto
But we don't know for sure yet
Always Lapland for us
Never Greenland
Wait
really
I've always grown up with the North Pole
Maybe its American influence growing up or something
Omg such a classic
I've seen people of multiple nationalities sit down in pubs expecting table service, ignoring all the people queuing at the bar, or being terrified that they're going to break some arcane British cultural faux-pas and be beaten up for it
> A lot of foreigners expect that Germany has a strong and unified culture
I think everyone does that about everyone else though
Like im aware of of Bavaria and how different it is to places like Stuttgart which is also different to Berlin really I doubt i'd be able to explain further than one place is more conservative traditional, one is hipster central and the other is super into manufacturing
Much in the same way im sure most Europeans wouldn't be able to explain the differences between areas of countries within the UK let alone the differences between the actual countries here
Pretty big thing in the UK due to the large Indian and Pakistani population here
So much so that honour killings are a bit of a topic as theres been a few high profile murders of women who have been killed by family members for not marrying the right person
Stone henge
It's awful
It looks like some cavemen made it or something
[Bridgewater Place in Leeds] isn't only awful architecture just because it's really ugly, but it's known for amplifying wind
when it gets windy, they have to close the road right by it
there was an incident once where a lorry got blown over and landed on someone, killing them
truly one of the worst buildings in history
Most houses in England are lines of connected brick blocks, I personally find them incredibly ugly
They look even worse when two connected houses paint their sides on clashing colours
By any chance is the sports hall used by priests
“Sure you can confess, or you can play ball
Beat me and it’s a clean slate”
Agreed
The irony of architects thinking they are innovative by aping a style that is almost 100 years old now
Ye, mandatory in secondary up to year 9
In the Uk-England-London
Yeah we had RE (religious education) where we learnt about why some Christians dont like abortion (and why theyre wrong) and also about various religions from the middle and far east
My primary was very pushy with Christianity,it ended up with most kids in my year group to call themselfs atheist by the end of year 6
It's compulsory here but kids can be taken out of the class if their parents wish
You learn about world religions, beliefs, values, philosophy, etc
It's called religious education in primary/early secondary and religious studies in later secondary
For me its a required subject until year 10 (14-15yo) where you can choose to drop it or not
A lot of schools may still make it compulsory though
I had compulsory  religious studies in GCSE
Depends on the school, but it's compulsory throughout the English system from Key Stage 1 to Key Stage 3 at least
That there's no go areas
Nottingham - it’s probably round about exactly in between the geographical and population centres of the UK
its not seen as particularly northern or southern and therefore biased towards one groups interests
Probably Birmingham
It is widely considered the UK’s second city
However, Edinburgh could be a good choice as capital of Scotland
York is also a favourite
It is capital of God’s Own County Yorkshire, which already makes it the most culturally, religiously, politically, strategically and economically important city in the world and, quite frankly, centre of the universe
Make it Randers
How many other towns have a rainforest
Does kinda have an aesthetic
Victorian redbrick, gothic and industrial architecture mixed with brutalism and modern shit
That's an incredibly Swedish answer, bravo sir
Bit like Vienna - used to be pretty central, now right over one side
yeah but you’re on r/europe, so
No UK, maybe I’m wrong but would assume that the population center of the uk is probably between London and Birmingham, while the geographic centre is probably just north of Leeds
I didn't say it was nice, but it's still an aesthetic
Fair enough, Manchester is way too northern though (not to mention disliked and distrusted intensely by northerners from Leeds and Liverpool) would rather have it be somewhere less culturally embedded in any particular regional identity so maybe York then
Also is so wealthy they can afford to keep windows open in their pubs all year round despite the heating bill
How many other Danish towns can boast that
I can't remember what it's called but there's building downtown that has a window open everyday of the year because apparently everytime the window is closed the building burns down
I think it's a pub but I'm not sure
It's an old timber framed building
Final round of trade deal coming up so we’re gonna find out in the next month
hopefully a lot
I think economically the UK’s financial services industry is always gonna be either a boon or a main competitor to the EU and we spur a lot of migration through it to get to London
We also are quite a market for consumer good and retail industries
Politically we always have liked to see ourselves as an intermediary between the US and EU
Uk leaders usually served as the Debbie downer when voting on new european initiatives, but I think Roy Jenkins was quite important as a proponent of the european movement leading the campaign to stay in in 1975 and then setting out the economic foundations for a single currency as head of the commission
By rejecting the opportunity to join at the beginning the UK probably also inadvertently set up the balance of power that France and Germany have with it
Why would a cheap market in Poland be good for Western countries products
A wealthy market means they can charge more
Apparently there are a lot of Portuguese dentists in the UK
Why Greece
I don't hear about them much anymore
How was the economy fairing before Covid, getting better
But corruption is a huge problem in Bulgaria
Course there are
Higher taxes, obviously, (though cheaper in the long run)
Wait times for non-emergency procedures can be longer, because everyone can get in line (which is like, the whole point)
In the UK even though equipment and quality of care are all top notch, a lot of the buildings are old and could do with renovations _at the very least_. Stuff like that
For the record, still 100% preferable to the alternative
Good lord, to think of how many people in my own family wouldn’t be here today (or would have died years earlier) were it not for the NHS
My mum developed cancer for the second time last year and had to undergo chemo, meaning she was greatly immunosurpressed _during a global pandemic_ (and in the UK where no less, where we were hit very hard)
They still took expert care of her; no more cancer as far as we can tell and her prognosis is very good
All thanks to the NHS which charged her not a single penny up front
We’re so lucky to have the NHS
Knowing that _everyone_ in my country has access to quality healthcare as a matter of moral principle is something I truly value about my country
P.S. a lot of people seem to forget that there absolutely are private healthcare companies in the UK
So it’s not even like there’s no choice
they’re really fast to offload you and don’t want to listen to begin with (maybe that’s just my bad experiences tho)
Polish
It's like Welsh but backwards
Maltese and/or Georgian
Maltese is just a melting pot of many languages like Italian, Arabic and English and Georgian, just, too many consonants
French
Just
why
Why would you want to speak, let alone *be*, French
Smdh
I think spoken Irish sounds fucking awesome
The orthography, however, is just bizarre
Around 8
45 was registration, you were 'late' if you turned up after 8
50 maybe
Lessons started at 9 and were an hour long
There was a break at 11am for 20 minutes
And 5 minutes between lessons 1-2 and 4-5
We had 5 lessons in a day and an hour for lunch
So we finished at 3
My school starts at 8:35 and finishes at 15:00
We have 5 lessons every and they are all an hour each
In the morning, we have to go to something called a form room where we basically check in to say we are in school
It’s basically a lesson where you just chat for 25 minutes (not included in the 5 daily lessons)
We then have 2 lessons back to back then get a 15 minute recess/break at 11:00 where we can go and get some food or just talk with friends until our next lesson
We then have 2 more back to back lessons until our lunch break at 13:15
Our lunch break is 45 minutes long and again we can just eat and talk to friends
At 14:00, we have our last lesson of the day then after that, we go home
For me, we get to school before 8:30 for tutor time(registration), start lesson 1 at 8:45, each lesson is an hour so we finish at 9:45 and the next one is 9:50-10:50, then it’s break for 20 mins, then from 11:15-12:15 and 12:15-13:15 we have lessons 3 and 4, then it’s lunch from 13:15-13:45, then lesson five from 13:45-14:45, and then the school day ends
My school is huge so each year has different things at different times, this is the year 10 and 11 (14-16) times

On Tuesdays and Thursdays I'd usually have free time for my last two classes
Whilst In most schools we were effectively allowed to do whatever, in my current one we were meant to stay in and not go home
Most people however, simply snuck out
I usually hung about until about 5-10 minutes before the day ended before leaving, as that way I could get an earlier bus at 1540 without feeling too guilty
Whilst in England what I'd be in is considered college (Aged 17-18, A-level or BTEC courses), here in Scotland it is an extension of High School
16-17 year olds do Highers, equivalent to A-Levels but slightly easier and usually with a higher amount of courses, and 17-18 year olds do Advanced Highers, again equivalent to A levels, but this time harder and fewer in number
As I moved from England to Scotland mid-course, I had to hold back a year as I'd only just begun whereas due to a difference in term dates Scotland was nearing it's midyear exams, which I failed spectacularly, so I dropped out and had a gap year (went to italy, had a great time)
This meant at my new school I had to only do my highers, as I would be too old to take part in the Advanced Higher courses
Probably NYE
The only day where is socially acceptable to be overtly nice to strangers
Or the weekend of the August bank holiday, people tend to be happier then
I agree, I love hot weather, but the warm weather of spring seems so much nicer; its a refreshing feeling to be able to walk outside in a T-shirt after 6 solid months of overcast days and seemingly eternal drizzle
15°C today in London and I would call that warm
It was -1C only a month ago
So what do you call anything between 5-22
Or are you saying that's all chilly
[Jamie Vardy] couldn't be anything but English
Looks like he should be coked up on a Saturday night trying to fight a bouncer because he got kicked out whilst his girlfriend is screaming at him to stop
Dutch people look aerodynamic
Best way to describe them
Eh, I'd disagree to be honest
I live in London and you can always spot Italians
Yes, sometimes Spanish people here and Italian people can be mistaken for each other in their big puffy coats, scarves, gloves and wooly hats in like April but generally you can tell Italians apart, especially Italian men
Yeah my GF and I go to Austria pretty much every winter and are often mistaken for Germans
We don't really look different to Scots on the whole tbh
That's how we like to think we look lmao
I dunno
Maybe just the way they hold themselves
We associate mullets with Germans for some reason
It's considered trashy here too
Its also considered super trashy here
Yes and I know that because they're my people
I'm one of them
I won't as long as you gib us ya loighter
99% of people who come to England visit London and then leave
You do find some tourists in York, Bath and Cambridge as well as the national patks but outside of the capital, we’re really not a popular destination
An advantage of this however is that our cities aren’t swamped with tourists so you don’t get situations in Spain or Italy where local prices increase and it’s unpleasant for residents
London lol, not sure anyone goes anywhere else
People within the U.K. will go to Scotland, Cornwall and the eastern coast of England for holidays a lot, and cause it’s fairly small you could drive to somewhere early in the morning and get their, spend a while and maybe sleep, and be back home by late the next day
It’s actually 50% of tourists believe it or not
50% of tourists don’t visit london when coming to the UK
Bicester village is a big tourist destination, 95% of the people there are from China and they save up money to go there and have huge shopping trips (much cheaper for designer brands I believe)
I wonder what it classes as "leaving"? If you spend a week in London but go on a daytrip to Stonehenge does that put you into the 50% that leave London or is it 50% of nights/tourist hotel bookings are in London
If it does i'd imagine a decent percent are in that group with the rest like you say visiting Edinburgh
We get a fair amount of tourists in manchester/liverpool as well, the total amount of away fans for CL/Europa games will probably total a fair amount
Hey I'm from Kent
As for the question, everyone knows the main important states like Texas, California, Florida etc
For the rest, I'd say it's variable
Personally I know them pretty well but in general I think most people would at least recognise the name as being somewhere in America for the majority of them, even if they might not really know precisely where in America it actually is, or know much about that state
Even so, while most are probably vaguely familiar I wouldn't find it *too* surprising if someone told me they'd never heard of some states
I know all the US states and their capitals
I’m a but of a map nerd and get addicted to online geography games pretty easily
I can name 26/50 US states off by heart last I counted
Its pretty common knowledge the names of States
Many I can't name in that moment I'll hear and know its a state
Isnt there 46 and 4 are actually called commonwealths not states
Relatable
Americans took the name ‘Birmingham’ from our ‘Birmingham’, and they have the audacity to actually pronounce the ‘ham’ as ‘ham’ rather than ‘um’. Lunatics
My GF and I set ourselves the task of completing that once, just every evening we would quickly run through that once and i think it took us 6/7 evenings to get all 50
That was a year or 2 ago and now if we do it we usually gets to like 49 and forgest something like Connecticut
We also regularly fail at naming all the European countries, actually better at listing all the African countries than I am at remembering North Macedonia
You were arguing over who was more upset about something
Odd argument to have
I was first introduced to this difference when watching an episode of the Simpsons
Marge was buying Lisa a swimsuit and found one “with a star on the fanny
” I was shocked like, what the ACTUAL fuck is going on here
I can't think of any words in English though that sound the same but can be identified based on stress
They can only be seperated based on context (or seeing them written down)
Can you give me an example
English
It's my first language and I dont have a second but [English is stupid
Irish I've found is difficult, mainly with pronunciation, I've tried learning German and its quite easier in comparison
I kind of found Irish (Gaelic) hard when I was learning it
I'll only think that because I've spoken english my whole life
Never really thought about it to be honest
I suppose I will have to tell you in a month whether I miss it
Kinda I guess
I must say it's not really something that's on my mind all that much and I actively think about, even with Brexit
I live in the EU and always have done
For me that's just how things have always been
I don't know any different to compare it too
I will be sad to leave though
I like the ease of travel between EU countries, but otherwise I can't say I've had any strong opinions
I am aware the EU is a good thing but it's hard to think of too many ways it clearly affects ordinary people like me on a daily basis
Definitely
Although it's highly unlikely and almost impossible that we will go to war with any other European country, being in the EU gives an extra sense of security
Also, it's amazing being able to travel to other European countries freely without a Visa
I wish Brexit wasn't happening, if I was old enough to vote during the EU referendum I would've voted remain, and I still would now
Edit: From the UK
I am definitely glad
Same
That sounds nice
Seconded
Same
I’m desperately sad that my country (England) is being dragged out of the EU by my country (England)
Please don’t suggest that we voted _en masse_ for Brexit
Leave won in England with [54% of the vote] Not a landslide at all
Millions and millions of us did not want this
How’d you mean
I don’t.
We still get to experience all that and I think I get what you mean
There is something just a little bit exciting about going somewhere with a different currency, seeing all the different coins and notes and mentally trying to work out the exchange rate
It does add to the experience a bit
Well quite, I guess for the average person there aren't any obvious benefits on a general day to day for people who don't have much reason to leave the country
I think that's why a lot of people voted the way they did, they didn't realise exactly what benefits the EU has
Because they think there will be some kind of  trade deal or simply don't think about it
I have talked about this sort of thing with people who voted for Brexit and it is remarkable some of the 'logic' they use
I don't know the answer to your question, but you might find it interesting to compare the worrying situation of Irish with Welsh
That also had centuries of decline, but is looking a lot healthier now, and is probably the Celtic language with the brightest future if current trends continue
Operation Barbarossa is a huge interest of mine so I find these stories extremely fascinating
Please keep them coming
I love tap water
Usually have it with cordial and dont feel properly hydrated if I dont have it
So many people would feel so much healthier if they drank enough water
I wouldn’t actually mind paying a few cents in spain for tap water
Drinks (assuming you’re not in a seafront bar or in the centre of madrid/barcelona/valencia) are so reasonably priced there that water is only really bought when you actually truly need it
Whereas in Germany you either pay €6 for a proper drink or €3 for a bottle of water
Tap isnt even offered
It's fine but it's much harder than the rest of the UK
It can be unpleasant to some if you're not used to it
But when you live there you can't really notice it and it tastes fine
We’re all really poor and there is a lot of crime and murder, but nobody notices in the city because London is the only one people care about, and the country because there are a lot of countries worse off
uhh based
Thank you, finally some truth bombs
I think I may have heard Lodz said before but I cant be sure so I will say there
I play ETS2 so I basically know most of them
Still got stuck at Sofia though
Sofia was actually my first one, embarrassingly
although i recognised quite a few after it
At least your football club has a cool kit
Sounds pretty great
Even a small amount of knowledge of English is probably more than most English people know of another language
You might think your English is bad but it's rarely as bad as our command of other languages
For this reason, almost no English person will judge you for having bad English or getting things wrong, most English people will be impressed because they cant speak any other languages
Additionally, because it's an international language, we're used to hearing non-native speakers
So yeah don't feel shy about speaking
Other than that there isn't really any advice that doesn't apply to other languages
Learn your grammar, practise pronunciation, watch TV shows/films in English to see how English is used naturally, read books in English to expand your vocabulary - stuff like that
Kind of makes sense to have another letter to represent "Ch" because pronouncing the letters "c" and "h" together sounds nothing like the sound that "Ch" represents
Also, do you mean "Ch" like in English or "Ch" like in french
why does that make it one of the most difficult languages to learn
I really really want to learn Italian so I'm curious
Yeah in french I believe "Ch" is pronounced like "sh" in English
I don't think many languages actually have the "Ch" sound although I may be wrong
Yeah I never thought of that but you're right
Kind of a pointless letter really
thanks
I guess the best way is (unsuprisingly) listening to how the locals use the language
Every european country thinks they drink the hardest
Not the most
The hardest
Not quite
We officially use the metric system but measure our height in feet and inches, our distances in miles, and our personal weight in stones and pounds
In my country (England) us younger lot feel European as well, however the older generations feel strongly British and would probably cry if someone called them Europeans
A lot of them are changing though, so it could be better in 10 years time
Mmmm that’s good shit
To be fair one of the things that I find confusing about America is the race thing, in America you would still consider yourself African / Italian / German if your relative 300 years ago was from there and since then have lives in America
In Europe, or U.K. and Ireland at least, most people have a lot of countries mixed into them but still consider themselves from the country they were born / grew up in
Like for example I still consider myself British even though I got like 15 countries mixed into me because I was born and grew up here
Not quite
We officially use the metric system but in everyday life we use imperial a lot
We drink pints of beer, we measure our height in feet and inches, we drive miles etc
Several Spaniards have written about a losing their whiteness when visiting America, where they are sometimes treated as a Latino-American
Tbh when I say "European" I usually mean people from continental Europe and am not referring to myself
Yeah Scandinavia is effectively an island
You have to cross the sea or drive through Russia to get to the continent so it would definitely have an effect
Sound nice
You didn’t. I did
I think it's cause Europe is 'over there' for us
We have to cross the sea to get there so it's a big event for us
It's the place throughout history where we've either feared an invasion from or have had to go to to fight a war
Even things like having to change money makes it feel more foreign
I think it's largely an Island mentality thing
If you leave the door open - were you born in a barn
If you keep leaving lots of lights on - it's like Blackpool illuminations in here
From the UK here
My parents always used to say "carrots make you see in the dark" and "when the ice cream van plays music, it means they've run out of ice cream"
I believed them for an embarrassingly long time
"you'll get square eyes" was definitely a thing my mum used to say
If you say ain't or innit "You sound as common as muck" "Use the Queens English"
If you steal her chair when she goes to do something "You'd jump in my grave if you could".
If you keep asking her to do stuff for you "What did your last slave die of
The 'look with your eyes, not with your hands' is common here too
"It looks like a bomb's gone off in here"
I love this
"Stop crying or l'll give you something to cry about" was one I remember
We have a similar expression "Were you  born in a barn"? And I think the point is that isn't common, they're basically implying you're a savage that doesn't know how to live in a house
I've only heard it as bridge in the UK too
We say that here
Ditto
"It looks like a bomb site in here"
My mum used to say "It looks like a bombs hit it
Although not enforced, it’s illegal to be drunk in a pub
Can’t handle salmon suspiciously in London
It’s illegal to wear a suit of armour in the Houses of Parliament
Edit: all of these aren’t enforced but they are laws
Like nut free zones but for people who are allergic to gay
You’d also probably get done for carrying a weapon with intent to cause harm
You don’t just carry something on the off chance you might find a Welshman to shoot, you’d have to be actively hunting them lmao
More often than not, but definitely not always
You are going to have to name some accents that’s actually pronounce these vowels the same because it sounds like absolute crap
Not in my northern English accent, not in RP, not in Scottish, not in American English
The bog
Getting the Germans to say Squirrel
Having said that, there’s a video on youtube where some valley girls gets them to say it and its far closer to English than how she pronounces it
Get a German to say "squirrel".
Also, get an Irishman to say "thirty three and a third"
For those wanting the full version, it’s Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch
For an English one, try "naphtha"
I’d definitely call it Bonfire Night
Maybe it’s a regional thing
The time our beloved king, Henry VIII, decided he'd outgrown his wife and asked the Pope to marry a newer one
When he declined, he decided to create an *entirely new church* that he ran
His entire life was pretty ridiculous when you look into it
You'll have to expand on this mate, I tried googling for more info and found nothing about any Spanish province wanting to become an American state
I remember reading that Russian Cossacks had heard so many crazy stories about him, that they came to love him and desperately wanted to capture him alive
I have never heard either of those terms
We just call it ‘the Armada’.
The Monster Raving Loony Party in the UK proposed a 99p coin to save change
My city (Chichester) is a Roman city, and still has the Roman walls around the city centre
There’s an excavated Roman palace just a mile or so away, and Roman baths found under the museum (which was very handy, and immediately incorporated as a big open display
Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland was where the Roman’s drew the border, they built a 3ft wall which was meant to keep the Picts in the north out
I don’t see how they couldn’t have just jumped over to be honest
But that was the foundation of a split between England and Scotland
Roman Baths in Bath, Fishbourne Roman Palace,  Hadrians Wall, City Walls of Exeter
Theres a well preserved roman house in Dorchester
Theres quite a lot of small sites too
Most aren’t that well preserved but some have been “restored”
I'm no expert but I remember reading somewhere that iirc the Roman Army was preparing an invasion force of some 12,000-20,000 to invade Ireland from Wales/Angelesy(Irish piracy was also a pain in the Roman gluteus maximus, i'd imagine they'd want to deal with that at the same time too, two birds with one stone as they say) etc
But the Ireland invasion was shelved then abandoned all together as iirc the Romans were having trouble subduing Scotland and Northern England, so they focused their attentions there(I mean in the aftermath of invasion it took some 12,000 of the 32,000 troops that innitally invaded Britain) to be permanently stationed in Northern England just to maintain control and hold onto Northern England
That's alot
And as you said Ireland was much like Scotland in the sense that to the Romans Ireland did not have much of anything so valuable or desirable to make invasion and conquest worth their already increasingly stretched thin manpower, time and resources, The invasion of Britain was already an expensive af and difficult, drawn out lengthy process
I think the Romans were just like "fuck that we're not doing and or going through all that again" xD, plus by that time England was already one of the Empire's wealthiest and powerhouse resource producing provinces, Ireland was superfluous to requirements
Meaning in the end Ireland was just kinda ignored, more an afterthought never a priority
How different (or not different at all, like is it so far back in history to have no effect) do you think Irish history might've been if Rome had invaded and conquered Ireland
Who'd win in a battle/war
The Great Heathen Army(by far the greatest force the Vikings were ever able to muster up to facilitate and following up the invasion/conquest/settlement of England) vs The Roman Army(circa 117AD where under the Emperor and indeed ex-soldier Trajan the Roman military was at its peak and at its most capable/effective) etc
Who wins and losses and why
In reply to /u/ScriptThat too and in reply to anyone else reading as well
We have them in the UK, surprised you guys dont have them too
Living in London I see people do this all the time
Mostly Spanish people checking they're not speaking to a Portuguese or Italian person and then speaking in Spainish to them
I can tell you’re Spanish from the syntax of what you wrote
I’ve met a lot more Dutch travelling than Swedes
Correct, Adverbs of time usually come at the end of a phrase
Yep, here in the UK if a package can’t be delivered somewhere secure, like the inside of your building or to a neighbour, it’s sent back to the post office for you to pick up later
It can sometimes be a pain in the arse to get your shit back but it’s better than having it nicked
At least one company here has [been caught] "losing" parcels at the depot and then selling the contents at auction
Most of the problems we have with parcel delivery are the result of courier carelessness (at best) rather than light-fingered neighbours, I think
I dont think so
I have heard stories of packages being left with neighbors in blocks of flats which then go missing but I dont think thats normal
hey, it’s willy-nilly btw, not the other way around
no worries
I’m learning spanish atm so trust me I make way worse mistakes
Peterborough
Correct
When I was younger I'd sometimes go to the shopping centre there with my family
Even though I'd been there loads of times, I didn't think I'd really been to Milton Keynes
After-all, I'd been to the shopping centre there, but I'd never seen a church, old buildings, narrow streets or little pubs
You know, all the things that make an organic town
It wasn't until later that I realised that shopping mall I'd been to WAS Milton Keynes
That was their 'town centre' so to speak
Just a big shopping centre surrounded by big roads, roundabouts and disconnected housing estates
A car-centric 20th century disaster of urban planning that goes against everything that makes a place pleasant to live
Even their football team is soulless, having been transplanted from London like an American sports franchise
Can confirm
I live there
yep
agreed
Home of Goldie Lookin Chain tho
Ipswich maybe, but Yarmouth at least has a shit kind of charm to it
Plus if you include Gorleston there's a decent beach to go to
Nahhh it was nice when I went
Shite airbnb tho
Truly grim
Not a letter but a space in therapist can do some damage
In English, a simple comma can make all the difference:
• Let’s eat, Grandma
• Let’s eat Grandma
Brings a whole new meaning to ‘it’s raining men’.
That’s interesting
I did wonder if it was only English or it translated to other languages
University in Scotland is free if you're Scottish or from a non-UK EU country
However I believe that after Brexit only Scottish students will be eligible for this
I’m pretty sure in the U.K. it’s free up until a certain point, although annoyingly I think university is the one you pay for
It’s free until 18 I think
I've always wondered: do most courses require a proper qualification in the Swedish language, alongside entry requirements
Thats what I was wondering really
I know the otherway round, my university has some systems in place if you want to take a test with the university that you know enough English, or they accept certain relevant qualifications (i.e. obtaining a C/VG in Avgångsbetyg / Slutbetyg från Gymnasieskola, respectively)
Food, UK has much much cheaper food than most of Europe
Also, considering salaries, alcohol in bars and pubs is comparatively cheap compared to some countries in western europe (edit: the bars and pubs thing is except in London)
Unlimited* - read the small print
The reverse is the case in the UK, you can get really cheap wine here in supermarkets (only place I have been able to find cheaper wine in regular supermarkets was Moldova, but they have lower incomes so it would be more as a %)
Still think it's hilarious 'Three Mills Reserve White' has a IWSC Silver Award
It's £3
23 a bottle and 10
5% ABV, I use it for cooking
Lidl do even cheaper wines that that, like £2
69 for the cheapest
> Apparently because you eat twice as much of them as the rest of Europe combined or something like that
That is an understatement
UK consumers bought over 450 million units of Heinz baked beans 2010
The second highest in Europe was Ireland below 10 million; and Czech republic was much further down at 1
5 million; Australia came second globally at 60 million
The off brand beans are even cheaper, I brought a 400g tin of the store brand at Asda for £0
23p yesterday, they do a value version for £0
18p I think, I don't know why people buy the value ones though, they taste bad and are only 5p cheaper
Its not
It might be expensive for Europeans who come here if they have to go somewhere expensive to get quality products, for example bread that isn't the fake bread, but for the stuff most British people buy, it is very cheap
My hometown is a port to France and to Spain (Portsmouth), and you can get some insanely cheap (and bad) wines from the stores near the port on the French side
Pensioners travel there on £10 return tickets from the local newspaper just to buy wine and tobacco
For example  [  £1
49 for a 750ml bottle of wine
There exists a lot of people who will eat baked beans 3-7 times a week, particularly poor people (council house food we call it)
It sort of acts like our version of rice for Asians
We'll eat mash potato, fish fingers and beans; chips, burger and beans; sausages, potato waffles and beans; baked beans on toast is a snack; we mix it with rice; and of course we occasionally eat it in a cooked breakfast
And it's known as "1 of your 5 a day" meaning its treated like a fruit or vegetable in a way
You get the idea, it's incredibly important to our cuisine in a way, even if its just not the bright side of it
Yeah its with yellow rice though, not white rice
And you'd include it as part of the normal dinner so you'll have a fish burger or something else on the side
It's poor people food, efficient and cheap
yes, until i go outside
I adore them
So if you call a manatee a sea cow what do you call the extinct Stella’s sea cow

I thought rabies had a fatality rate of like 99
99% (edit: 14 of 17,500 people have survived; only 99
92% fatal lol)
Only a handful of people have ever survived it, and they were basically vegetables afterwards
Around Wiltshire (Salisbury Plain especially) there are warning signs for tanks
I was never quite sure what I should do if I saw one
Perhaps hide in a bush and wait for it to pass

Unfortunately for you, if anyone knows anything about getting shit faced in a foreign country, its also the English
That's sick (and I don't mean in the good way)
We only have a Prime Minister in the UK but the Prime Minister
Here are some differences: The president is a head of state but the PM isn’t, The king/queen is the head of state unlike the US (they have little to no power though), Prime ministers actually aren’t technically elected
The queen appoints the prime minister to the job (it’s always the one with the most votes though)
I think the PM can write laws and the president has to suggest them (I’m unsure on that one, it may be false
I didn’t know there was a Europe day
I find there aren’t many flags generally, the only time I have seen a lot of flags is in London
I live in the countryside so there’s not really any government buildings here
Edit: Grammar
I'll be displaying it, but you'll be shocked to hear that it's not common here
At the moment in the UK the EU flag has almost become a protest symbol
I’m literally in an uber as I write this comment and I just went past a building with an EU flag flying from it’s roof
Siiiiigh
Oh well
I'd be surprised if it's an obligation, at least from the EU
Kes (1969)

While I think of it, there was a really odd Hungarian film I caught a bit of many years ago and am curious about
It seemed to be some sort of satire on sport, with a competitive eating champion training for a big competition
I particularly remember some sort of box he had to vomit into while the trainer turned a handle for no apparent reason
Such a good film
I love the scene with the man who comes out the toilet
I could (and have) spent hours trying to figure out the moral or the relevance of the story he tells but I’m either too dumb or it’s meant to be ambiguous
probably both LOL
Those nude scenes were certainly
extensive
I’d be more concerned if it was a happy go lucky film about heroin addicts because the reality is once your life revolves around heroin you’ll neglect or backstab whatever gets in the way
That’s the truth of the situation
Trainspotting is a film that explains or at least gives an insight into the mind of a junkie, it sounds like you want a film with a happy resolution
The two don’t agree
Yeah fair enough, it is depressing and sad in a lot of ways
I guess I’m the opposite in that I revel in the grittiness of it
It is hard to watch but some of my favourite music can be hard to listen to because it’s sad etc, for film it’s similar

Ideologically I skew somewhat centrist libertarian so I quite like Macron although he seems to spend a lot of time trying to get media attention rather than getting on with anything
Mark Rutte and Pedro Sanchez both seem like decent leaders as well
The Queen is our head of state, not the head of government
That’s the prime minister
Me too
Good idea
Hardly, she's pretty much as British as can be
Its not like other people don't have ancestors from other places yet we don't say Boris Johnson is Turkish or Nigel Farage is French
For English, I love the fact that a description I saw for it is "English is actually 3 languages in a trench coat pretending to be one"
Not purely language but in the UK if you use any noun while saying ‘absolute’ before it, you can make it into an insult
For example “You absolute pineapple” could be used to call someone stupid
“You absolute bus station” could also be used to call someone stupid
“You absolute pencil sharpener” could be used to call someone stupid and it goes on and on
They aren’t usually offensive insults but more of a funny insult
Like if your friend does something stupid, just compare him
to any noun
I love that its nearly impossible to replicate the British accent and sound like a native compared to other languages in Europe
Why do we always have put our language down
All our food basically
Steak and Kidney pie usually gets some strange looks when I mention it to foreigners
I'm guessing its the aversion to eating Kidneys rather than steak
Gravy and chips
I’d imagine battered fish might be unusual, IIRC many mainland European countries prefer their fish actually looking like fish, complete with the eyes (which many people over in England find nauseating)
Black pudding is also a disgusting conception when I think about it
Iv had frogs legs and snails in the north of France and it was bloody delicious
Growing up I used to eat corned beef sandwiches with ketchup on white bread
Even I think it sounds disgusting but I loved it
Lol
I think we both have lacking food cuisines due to our climate
I was literally talking to an American friend of mine about this today
I’m encountered Americans before who told me British food was bad before admitting they’d literally never tried any traditional British food
Yeah I agree bunnies have been s staple of british food for centuries
Fallen out of favour with most people now but I eat them all the time
Beautiful meat
So is woodpigeon
But I couldn’t imagine eating songbirds
When I had them thy were like little lumps of chewy beef
But not too bad
Check morrisons
To be fair we eat loads of lamb and that isn't really that common across Europe
Yes that’s Scotch eggs you’re thinking of, great for just a snack or a side to go with your lunch or potentially a meal of its own if it’s big enough
How much sunlight do you get in the summer
In northern england we have just slightly longer winter days 7-4 and the seasonal depression is bad enough here so it must be bad for you
Although our long summer days are really nice, its never technically night and only dark between about 11 and 330
Yeah, its weird how Americans in particular think London/ the UK is "so rainy" but think the rest of Northern Europe has better weather than us
I saw a post from an American guy a while ago who said he didnt want to visit the uk due to the rain, so was going to ireland or Sweden instead
London has 106 rain days per year, which is less than both Dublin and Gothenburg
Yes
Blimey, that's a bit much
Love the idea of a guy seeking sunnier weather with you guys, though, haha
"Tamam" is as good a word as "okay", to be fair
I would tell him that another war happened
And  the industrial revolution happened and that people have been to space and technology is something that most people can’t live without and that the earth is slowly warming up
IMO The City feels more modern than Canary Wharf which feels kinda dated and little 90s/early 2000s. The City is where you see the super modern architecture
Probably hull, at least out of all the major cities
Although that article says the name of the island Iona in Scottish Gaelic is Ì.
Not a town but there’s the River Og which
Omg this sucks
The closest major language to English is probably Dutch and that is still completely unintelligible

Why is it a sin of adding ova to female surnames

, It is quite common for Czech females to have surnames to have this suffix is
Why is it so bad
I watch alot of Time Team, and one thing ive learned is that in the long run no buildings are permenant(no matter how big or impressive)
So 850+ years is very good run, its really not the end of the world nor is it a tradegy as history never stops, something else always comes after
But being brutally honest: It holds no special significance or importance or meaning to me
I mean jts just a cathedral ultimately, and they're a dime a dozen in Europe
I feel like some of the reaction to this fire is a bit ott and hyperbolic, overblown
and its only because of where it is
Nobody would care if it was in Eastern Europe or even further afield outside of Europe etc
So yes its unfortunate it went up in flames, but its the nature of very old wooden buildings after all
Theyre tinder boxes
Often times its a matter of when not if it bursts into flames
Its happened countless times throughout history, it'll happen ago too when your dealing with such a long time scale as these buildings are on
I look at this being merely another chapter in Notre Dame's long storied history, its nothing to get so upset about imo
Agreed, this could easily be a landmark at home and it's just daunting to see such an important part of culture in flames
We call them horns here too
Not sure where you get the idea we call them klaxons
In the uk it’s somewhere in between on horn honking it’s not totally accepted but generally if you do it people will probably just think you’re an asshole rather than it being particularly aggressive
As usual in Britain where manners are everything we have more cases of the opposite where minor gestures of annoyance actually mean the person is furious
To ‘tsk under your breath and shake your head is the British equivalent of yelling “I’m fucking furious”
I am English, when attempting to be polite, we usually go the other way and express hostility as mild irritation
The horn thing is also law here, only to be used in emergencies but living in a high immigrant area of London you hear them all the time - where i'm from you never hear them
We only use the word klaxon for alarms on gameshows
I don't think I've ever heard it in any other context
I sound more confident in German and a bit ruder compared to English
That's just how humans are
I moved to London from the East Midlands of England and I fucking love it
While I accept that living preferences are subjective and it's certainly not for everyone, London is a wonderful city and honestly I do feel the impulse to defend it when people get salty
Likewise, the idea of living basically anywhere else in the rest of the UK, at this point in my life, sounds like pure fucking hell
Different strokes, innit
Edinburgh
Monaco
I don't hate London, I hate the fact that people assume bc I'm from England I'm from London
My first 40 years in London, thinking it's a bit crap, followed by moving out and now *knowing* it's more than a bit crap
Yep, fuck London
Cheaper
The last one I can think of is over Suez in 1956
We very occasionally have coalitions (there have been 7) or minority governments
But yes, No Confidence motions are particularly hard to pull off
We learn languages in Secondary and sometimes Primary schools, the most common ones are Spanish, French, German and occasionally Mandarin
Most people go on to take a language as a GCSE (exam) subject, but few people would actually consider themselves bilingual
Having a second language is considered extremely useful, and, like in many other countries, employers are more likely to hire people with more languages under their belt
Like Ireland we're very much in the second category
It's certainly not something taken for granted
Barely anybody speaks a different language, around 1/5 speaks french and 1/10 German or Spanish, but there is not really a point to as we invented probably the most learnt / spoken language worldwide
In the UK everyone is expected to know basic English, but many think it’s optional
(Geddit
Yep, this pretty much sums it up
I love the Netherlands urban cities, rural villages, canals, cycling culture, and food
When the french don't like what politicians are doing the bloody well let them know about it
If we have fuel duty rises today, there will be a mighty mumbling and grumbling you will be able to hear from literally feet away
I get the impression that French people genuinely love being French, which is nice
Skirt wearing trend setters  Independent, tight knit communities, proud people
Edinburgh rain or shine is my favourite city in Britain
Passionate people, grafters, the Welsh language has survived
(no thanks to us), Rugby and singing
Humourous story tellers, musically gifted, Whiskey and Guiness
Resisting the Anglo/American way of life
Cosmopolitanism
France is the first image I'd have if you asked me to describe the word, "culture".
European values and institutions, multilingualism,  and egalitarianism
Ingenious old revivals, modern nation
Laid back and cool country
Equality, hygge and an educated society
99% of Denmark's Jews survived WW2 for a reason
Folk traditions, lovers of the great outdoors (Norway's outdoors is hard to beat), generousity and the public oil fund
Christmas traditions, engineering, sauerkraut and Jürgen Klopp
White pudding is really nice
Do you not queue properly
Stroopwaffle and other Dutch snacks :)
True, but then again you are French
I think he means cause we invented them
I agree, but white pudding is nice when you want something a little milder
Nigel Farage, for those of you that don’t know he was a massive part of the brexit campaign and is terribly racist
I think most of England would say Katie Hopkins tbh
Probably Piers Morgon
We would be better without him
Only one
If I could I would ban most our politicians but if I could only choose one person to be banned from England it would have to be Donald trump because he is an arsehole
He's a grown man who threw a tantrum over a sausage roll
He's also said some disgusting things before
He's not alright
Imagine school if your name was Toyota Prius lol
I really like the museum of London, along with the Museum of London: Docklands
Very detailed exhibits
Bovingtonn Tank Museum or IWM Duxford (planes)
Both two of the best I've seen if you're interested in tanks or planes
I really enjoyed the Uffizi but I feel it could be perceived as boring to some people
Creepy medieval portraits and Jesus for days
Oh, so much Jesus
I know it’s usually considered the least of the golden triangle but when I was in Madrid I found that the Thyssen had one of my favourite collections of any art gallery I’ve been to
>Less common languages
When it's your kids bedtime so you speak to your wife in North Sentinalese
They speak Sentinalese, which is probably a member of the now engangered Adamanic family
Nobody's really sure though, and I think that's for the better
My native language is English and I FUCKING HATE that we expect everyone to speak English
Annoys the shit out of me
But of course I really appreciate foreigners trying
Even more so when I see they can speak Portuguese which is my other language
What I think many other Europeans don't understand, especially many people in this sub is how understanding a broken language is a skill
Because most people learn English and not everyone is great at that, as a first language English speaker you work to understand broken English from French, German, Spanish, Indian, Chinese, Dutch etc etc and not get confused at missing words or completely mispronounced words
If I speak German or French to someone and mess up I find I get made to feel like a fucking idiot even though they can't pronounce various key words in English
I always do the 'Hallo/Guten tag
urrr, spraken ze inglish
' and just feel so uncomfortable the entire time
That’s actually a really fair point
My attempts at speaking French in Paris only seems to annoy French people more
My mum is fluent and even she gets rude comments for mispronouncing things from French people who can barely pronounce anything in English correctly
Yeah I get that
Like we all need a language we can speak over the internet
But the sense of entitlement when we go abroad really bugs me
I do think it’s getting better though
North of England = burning coal
South of England = dandelion and burdock
A UK wide one is the smell of stale beer/booze you find in an old pub
Dunno what England as a whole would smell like but Cornwall would probably smell like fish, salt and slurry
As a smell, it's remarkably pervasive
Yes, Somerset and Devon would smell similar but swap the Fish with cider/beer or ice cream
Self hate isn't healthy
Should be allowed for medicinal use
And recreational in moderation and with certain restrictions
Your lawmakers ruin their lives
I agree it can be damaging, but what about those of us who use it responsibly
I don't believe my mug of weed tea at the end of the working weed should be illegal just because a minority may choose to abuse it
I genuinely used to confuse Spain and Italy all the time when I was a kid
I didn’t fully get that they were two completely separate countries
Similarly, I assumed the US was level with us
I thought New York was right across the sea because the weather seemed similar
I had no idea how far North we are
There isn't a single part of the UK that is more southerly than any part of the US (apart from Alaska)
Me too
I was only young but I thought that something ww2 related happened in Scotland on a beach
It just sounds so Scottish
It took me a while to figure out the difference between UK and GB as well
Weird how you can speak english and use reddit but arent aware that its totally not the norm
Usually I would go to Caffe Vergnano and buy their ground coffee
I'm English and once was seeing a German girl
It was a novel experience
Had to make sure she knew I was joking some of the time
Dont think the banter culture is as strong there
I learnt some german and she was always quick to point out  when I got it wrong
Something i dont think we do here in England very much
Sounds very negative but it was actually very positive
those are the just the differences that stuck out to me
I’ve dated two Romanian women in the past and they were polar opposites of each other, one big city girl and the other country/small town girl
Had lots in common with city girl and full of energy culturally very similar; was fun relationship shame she had to move back home to care for family
The other one was opposite, work driven and quite religious which was quite a conflict with my agnostic beliefs; she was also quite guarded and hard to crack
Culturally not much difference in my opinion, was great visiting there and seeing the lay of the land from local point of view rather than tourist
Hospitality wise I loved it, I’ve never ate so much or felt like I should eat so much in my life, I love their food especially Sarmale and mici
Always made to feel like one of the family and loved to hear general conversion, even if it was about the most mundane trivial subjects sounded like passionate debates with a lovely flow of words which was nice on the ears
I’m English and my boyfriend is from Northern Ireland
So yes and no
Im English and had that same thing with a german girl
Had to make sure she knew I was actually joking
The banter culture isn't as strong
i think they also find it harder to laugh at themselves on the continent
I think those pet names must be regional because they are super common up north
I think that must’ve been a rare case as majority of people take their shoes off, especially in a strangers house and even more so with carpets
As a brit iv never known anyone who doesn't take their shoes off in the house
Yeah 100% all my mates love several times a day
Even men call each other love l
Gorgeous, darling, sweetheart etc
Could go on forever
I once got a message from a polish friend asking me “do you eat
Turns out the difference between “do you eat” and “are you eating” is pretty unique to English
Very often people fuck up how to properly say ‘coke’ and end up saying ‘cock’.
I used to work at a busy pub in London which got a lot of tourists, and hearing someone say “I would like a cock” or “can I get two cocks” happened multiple times
Rest in peace in peace
>”pretty unique”
English is one of the few languages that distinguishes between those tenses
Not really
hahah no it's not that big of a deal
Absolutely not, where I'm from we use it often
Used in public
Not really
It’s a swearword obviously but no one gives a shit unless you’re being particularly loud
around children kinda big deal but anywhere else not big deal
Haha nope, a lot of people really dont care if you swear, any swear word, but nothing derogatory (racist, homophobic etc (you can be charged)) but yeah most people dont care, just maybe older people and people with children
Depends on the workplace
If you aren’t dealing with public and talking with colleagues and not bosses it’s usually fine
Non English speakers tend to use English swear words to sound more acceptable than their own swear words
Especially in Germany they will have English swear words on tv in the day and stuff like that
Sounds like you might have visited my Nan in the home mate
Never heard anyone say heck that wasn’t an American
Maybe middle class England

A (a) i (i) o (as in oh) and I can say of the top of my head ins Pankaj there's y (and) and in French there is á (at)
I think it’s normal to know your family member’s wages and a few very close friend’s wage but if someone I just knew slightly and asked me what I was on, I’d never tell them
Neither are particularly common
With Spanish food you'll usually get green olives, with pizza you usually get black olives
I prefer green but I'd say they are equally popular
Not the same in Scotland
Scottish Gaelic went away largely as a result of self-imposed restrictions, directed by Scots in the Lowlands
There's nothing funny about it, you just don't know what you're talking about
The Scottish crown and parliament had long sought to build a unified state and actively engaged in persecution in the 1400s and thereafter
The core Gaelic region was squashed and rebellions quenched, land was forfeited and the lordship of the Isles was removed as early as the mid-late 15th century
The Scottish Parliament started plantations in Gaelic regions of Scotland during the late 16th century, the Statutes of Iona and School Establishment Act 1616 forcefully pushed the English language on Gaelic communities; the latter stating "Inglis be universally established, and Gaelic be obliterated because it is a main cause for the barbarity and incivility of the people of the Isles and Highlands
If we go further ahead into the Highland Clearances (1750-1860) - which is where any English involvement can be ascertained - then you should be aware that the majority of landowners and industrialists who were evicting the Gaels were Scottish themselves
You're weird
I walked on my own through several twisting alleyways to get to school when I was 8, in a country known these days by some for being
crime-y. Looking back, I realise that my parents may have made a judgement error
Interestingly many non-standard native English dialects don't actually make the was/were distinction
[See here]
> The construction ***she were*** *wearing a mask* might sound unusual to some ears, but in some dialects in northern England and the Midlands, many speakers indicate the past tense of ‘to be’ by saying *I were*, *you were*, *he*, *she* and *it were*, *we were* and *they were*. This means the verb is **unmarked for person**, while speakers of Standard English differentiate by using *I was* and *he*, *she* and *it was*. Some dialects, perhaps particularly those in the South East of England, favour a similarly unmarked version using the singular form of the verb *I was*, *you was*, *he*, *she* and *it was*, *we was* and *they was*.
One thing that seems to be fairly common is our progressive tense
The difference between "I drive to work" and "I am driving to work" is confusing for a lot of ESL speakers
Also our use of the auxiliary "do" - I've seen things like "I don't can that" instead of "I can't do that"
Pen drive is correct I've definitely heard that before
An example I found:
Also known as pen drives, USB flash drives use flash memory to store and transfer data between devices that are fitted with USB ports
[link to example]
I never knew that Americans didn't pronounce the h in herb and I've just checked and you're right
I was going to comment and say you definitely pronounce it
You know what, I think you're probably right
If I heard someone with a non-native accent speaking like that I probably would assume it's an unintentional error rather than that they were specifically trying to use a northern/midlands dialect feature
There is something of an expectation that second language learners will learn the standard language
That one is *far* more common than just Scotland actually
I'm down in Kent and hear it plenty (and I'll admit I probably do let it slip out myself from time to time)
I assume it's just a widespread non-standard variant rather than being restricted to any particular area
It's probably more class based than anything
Edit: Another good one which is widespread (and is mentioned in the article I linked) is past tense come
So like *I come* instead of *I came*. Apparently this one though is actually the older version, rather than the standard one, which is pretty cool
I know what you mean
For some reason certain ways of saying things will just get on your nerves a bit haha
My dad does the come one *a lot*! I think it's most noticeable when he does it with he/she
E.g. saying something like 'when he come back' for 'when he came back', since for the other pronouns it just sounds like the present but here it sticks out even more cos it lacks the -s ending that he/she have in the present tense
This feels like the most interesting one to me
I don't know much about the Azerbaijani diaspora but I would guess its rarer for you guys to bump into a fellow countryman than, say, it is for me elsewhere in the world
For me it's crazy the other way around
Like in some countries it's compulsory to have it on you at all times
The idea that I could get in trouble for not having any ID when going to buy some eggs is crazy to me
We don't have official IDs so we use our driving licences
I only ever bring mine out if I'm buying alcohol or going to a pub/club because I have a baby face
Yeah but what if you're not going to anything governmental or financial
What if you're literally just buying eggs and bread
Is it a requirement then
While London has definitely been *the* biggest for a long long time, the other major cities have changed around a bit
I know historically places like York and Norwich used to be very major cities at one point, whereas nowadays they're pretty far down the list
I assume it would still be a southwestern settlement
Maybe Hafnarfjordur or Kopavogur
Was gonna say eyup a minute then noticed you said *capital* city
1/3rd of Sheffield lies in the Peak District good sir
Very green indeed
We all know that's actually Rotherham come on
Ive three questions
To any a non-native English speakers reading:
**1
** What did the English language sound like to you before you learned English
And also what does English sound like to your non-native ears
, is it a harsh or soft sounding language and when an English speakers speaks what do they sound like
, And in general what sounds/noises do you associate with English
**2
** What did the various English accents(English/Welsh/Irish/Scottish/American/Canadian/Australian/New Zealand) etc sound like to you before you learned English
, Could you differentiate them
**3
** And lastly does English sound like a Germanic language to your ears
My options for Erasmus were between universities in Prague, Istanbul, Amsterdam and Tampere, Finland
Just seemed weird to have these cities renowned throughout the world for their history, architecture and grandeur, and then just
Tampere
Like I'm sure it's probably lovely but it just doesn't seem to fit in with the other three
Yeah, if they have a little Spanish flair next to their tag, they're probably Spanish
You can tell a lot by queueing etiquette
The most chaotic of which I've witnessed is the Chinese version
I.e there is no queue
Its a free for all
They are all talking at the same time
Its survival of the fittest
Working on a cruise ship in guest services we had to literally shout and order them back into the queues
Odd-looking modernist specs is something I associate with Germans, particularly but not exclusively middle-aged German women
Like, take the text off the cover of [this book] and he still just *looks* German
Hahaha man this made me laugh
For me the germans that come to my hometown are always I  hiking gear , little shorts and those walking sticks
My personal favourite was watching a German tour group huddled around a war monument, listening to their tour guide who had stood up on it to loudly direct and speak to the group
I don't think he realised and it was innocent but it gave me a hefty chuckle
I could see some older English people in shock
Its absolutely true
At least in my hometown
Its really American sounding to me
They are also real high if not the highest in percentage of blondes
We have letting the cat out of the bag which is like giving away information too soon
English doesn't really have anything like that
There isn't one single authority on the English language
We seem to manage just fine without one though
I think Irish is a pretty cool language
Yeah, all of the silent letters and everything and how mh makes a v
And we break them constantly
I really like Beadnell bay in Northumberland
otherwise in the uk as a whole Pembrokeshire coast national park in Wales and some of the beaches in the outer Hebrides particularly the Isle of Harris are beautiful
Saw them live at hyde park years ago
a lot of fun
It'd be a damn shame not to mention the Newcastle-Sunderland split
I would actually say Newcastle and Sunderland for England
Not an animated movie, but there's a video kn YouTube I can't find right now talking about the use of accents in Witcher 3
For instance ancient spirits and the like have Welsh accents because the Welsh language is ancient
They also tried to use accents that weren't common in fantasy media, such as the Viking-inspired Skelligers being Northern Irish and many of the peasants having Birmingham/West Midlands accents
Not quite the same thing as I’m English so the English-speaking films won’t be dubbed for me, but in *The Death of Stalin* I really liked the character of Georgy Zhukov
He was originally born to a poor peasant family irl, so in the film the character spoke with a northern English accent (IIRC the actor that played him, Jason Isaacs, is from Liverpool), the accent often being synonymous with the working class in England
There are plenty of different dialects in England and in general I find the north of England is much less homogenised than the south
I live in Yorkshire which has its own dialect
Some old people use "thee" "tha" and "thy" but that is mostly dying out
In fact the whole dialect is dying out a bit but the same is true with all dialects
There are towns in North Yorkshire where everyone sounds like a southerner - makes me shudder to think
if I go to London with some people from my city, they will not have a clue what I'm saying
Erm well kind of, the huge amount of accents in England each have different phrases and words
Sometimes, as someone from the East Midlands, its hard to understand a Scouser or a Geordie
That's accents
Dialects died down with railway travel and the homogenisation of media and education, though there does still exist significant differences but not as much as there used to be
There's a lot of dialects: Cumbrian, Yorkshire, East Midlands, Northumbrian, Scouse, West Country etc
You're probably very aware of a Yorkshire dialect with things like:
- isn't = int
- didn't = dint
- hasn't = ant
and I'm sure there's a lot I'm missing out
And for where I'm from (East Midlands) we have things like:
- yours = yorn
- hers = hern
- ears = tabs
- lunch = snap
- got her = gorra
A lot of our dialects have been diluted so maybe if you're older you would probably know more
For Yorkshire, there's loads of dialect words
Sumat/nowt/owt : Something / Nothing / Anything
Thee/Thou : Formal you/Informal you
Parky : Cold
Mither : Bother
Bait : Food (this is actually separate to the common word of bait and comes from the old Norse beit)
Foss/Force : Waterfall
Ginnel : alley
Skrike : cry/scream
I mean there's literally hundreds of words like that, those are just the ones I've personally heard with any degree of frequency
Yeah I'm from Lancashire and Yorkshire, while similar, definitely noticeable difference
Manchester seems to have a selection all its own, mind
This is going to cause an argument as its a complex issue and not even worth going into detail
Ireland fully blames all of the issues with Northern Ireland on England (which is mostly correct) but a good portion of the blame also lays with Scotland due to the plantation of Scottish lords
Quit often Irish people will joke that its them and the Scots against the English in this world forgetting;
Caveat; I cannot stress how much im not saying England are clean here
Im just saying the memes of Celtic brotherhood and all that and 'yeah we all hate the English together' aren't quite inline with history
England gets blamed for starting the transatlantic slave trade when it was the Portuguese
We were also the first to ban slavery but that gets scribbled out of the history books as it doesn't fit the narrative of 'England bad'.
The Bengal famine during the Second World War
I won't go into the details, but put simply, it was more to do with Japanese commerce raiding and woeful mismanagement by the largely Indian local governments of India
It also may have originated in east Asia, or Kansas, or in a number of other places
It is, however, unlikely that it was Spain
I think the argument is that its equally Wales and England's fault seeing as Wales voted in line with the final result
Also can we add voting in your own countries interest to that
I voted remain and I can understand why Scotland is angry about Brexit, and I support them if they want to leave the UK, but I'm tired of this whole narrative that its just English people that are selfish cunts that don't care about the rest of the UK
Scotland didn't decide to stay in the UK out of altruism, they did it because they thought it would be better for Scotland
I don't recall them ever discussing or caring how it would affect the rest of the UK if they had left
We're not the only ones that just think of ourselves when we vote
Britain created some of the earliest concentration camps during the Boer war of 1900-1902, but most people have forgotten that and just think concentration camp = Nazi Germany
I guess we got away with that one
They weren't death camps though, that was a uniquely German thing
yep, that's how the British empire was created as well, just 'helping out' one set of natives against another
Am I wrong
Perhaps you would like to educate me
When you cannot reasonably deny your ancestors were utter bastards, it seems pointless arguing over who was worse, since everyone in the past was a bastard
Personally I take the view that most of history is rich people doing bad things to poor people, often with the connivance of other poor people
Performing arts perhaps maybe is one
Not offered by every school in England but it's taught as a compulsory subjects in many
I had Performing Arts in my first years of secondary school
It was drama, theatre studies and music rolled into one at a much larger scale
One week we'd be in the classroom the next week we'd be in the theatre performing plays and learning about how theatres work
In primary school we did reading comprehension
Essentially we'd read a text and answer questions about it
Not in a sense of analysing (as in English literature lessons) but just questions that test that you've actually understood what you've read
Often it would be a short story and in early years the questions would ask simple things like "what colour was the car" and then later on it would be more things like "why did X character do this" (but obviously the motives would be pretty simple)
I think the difference is the way the subjects are divided up
We did food tech (essentially cooking), wood work, sewing/textiles etc
but they were all separate subjects (although came under the umbrella of "technology" or "tech")
>Also our "geography" (called earth studies literally here) might or might not be different than in other countries as it's not just about maps but more about how the earth works (weather, climate) but also issues of developing countries
Basically everything related to earth
This sums up my Geography education here
Oh yeah, big time
See our museums full of other nations' treasures, our crown with an Indian jewel as it's centerpiece
Also, all our national heroes are other countries' villains; Churchill in India, Cromwell in Ireland
We were a very bad people with very good PR
Also
Is it scOHne, or scon
Is Cromwell really regarded as a national hero here
>a very bad people
Compared to who
>Ulster Plantation
>UK; Ulster got civilised
Said no one ever
Basically the Irish Victims guide to history
chip on shoulder noted
Nothing about the Raj or the Slave Trade
You must be ancient
These have been part of the curriculum for years
There was a famous, possibly apocryphal, exchange between a German diplomat and a French one at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, with the German upset that it laid responsibility entirely on Germany
DE: "What will history say
FR: "History will *not* say that Belgium invaded Germany
If you're a republican
Just objectively, not relatively
Pointing out other nations were bad too doesn't ameliorate our own behaviour
It should be said that the main statue outside the HoC is over 100 years old so its quite hard to move due to it being a protected monument
Its also controversial even today and was even controversial when it was built - the Conservatives at the time actually voted against it and it only passed due to unionists in NI
Yeah, wouldn't surprise me if it had been vandalised a few times over the years
If Stalin lived 400 years ago where razing cities and mass murders were a normal way of conducting warfare rather than a war crime against international law
Germans so apologetic about WW2 that they get a pass for committing genocide in their African colonies a few decades earlier
The history curriculum in England actually compares him to Hitler for his actions in Ireland
Funnily enough Ian Paisley is not representative of the British opinion whatsoever, unless you think we’re all raging anti-Catholic “no surrender” types
Everything you said above is easily reversible following the same simple formula:
Irish: Vague moral platitudes using modern moral standards applied to far history while simultaneously hypocritically supporting evil actions taken in the modern day
English: Nuanced point on above historical reference using one sided justification
Protip: act like a victim, be treated as a victim
Of course it does
It's written by far left revisionist teachers
Cromwell was an evil bastard
I'm not debating that
The moral standards applied to him in the modern era should acknowledge say, the 30 years war, which raged on in Europe at similar time and where 'genocide' type actions like those taken by Cromwell were almost normal
I'm not saying he wasn't a nasty fucker and what he done was justified, I'm saying the very specific hurrah Irish people make about their victimhood in this regard when such actions were taking place semi commonly at the time is a little self indulgent (particularly when they're used to justify the IRA killing kids in England via "Muh 800 years")
> Have thought about invading France and shipping the French to the Falklands as cheap (free) labour on the rock farm's there
Not a day goes by without me having this thought
Loads of random shit was talked about in regards to "solving" Northern Ireland including relocating Hong Kongers (they also considered Scotland) so I wouldn't put too much weight into it
I think it would be right to acknowledge that there's a wide variety of opinions of him ranging from "Who
", "Dictator" and "Republican". It would be unfair to say he's loved though, I think for a lot of us here he's just another historical figure who did some good and some bad
The distance between now and him is almost equal to the distance between him and Genghis Khan, it would seem to be a waste of energy to seriously criticise him or be upset by his actions
As an English speaker with essentially no knowledge of any other Germanic languages, I understood very very little
With the Scandinavian ones I could only pick out occasional words like *konstruksjonen*; I couldn't get any actual meaning from them really
The German one I got literally nothing
The Dutch one was the best for me; I could get little snippets here and there
Still not enough to get the whole meaning (or even the gist of it really) but it definitely felt the most similar
Edit: Just seen you added some more
It's the same story with Low German, Bavarian, Luxembourgish and Icelandic: I understood next to nothing, but the Afrikaans one was actually pretty good in comparison
I could even understand some full sentences like "Suid-Afrika is een van die mees etnies diverse lande in Afrika
Die land het meer Europese immigrante ontvang as enige ander land in Afrika".
Could barely understand any of it but Dutch was closest
One thing I've noticed about Dutch is that Dutch sounds like English but it doesn't make sense
This is what I hear
I can pick up a couple of words on the Dutch one
Maybe 10% at most
It's like reading Old English
That's definitely better than the castle page
I still can't understand most of it though
I think all the names helped a lot as well (cities, islands, overseas territories etc
) Without things like that to give a rough guide on the topic I think I would've got even less
My understanding of these two is going to be tainted by the fact that I actually do speak some French and I did study Spanish for a couple of years back in school (even though I can remember next to none of it, the exposure is there and obviously the similarity to French will help as well)
I could get the gist of both the articles to be honest
I really wasn't expecting to understand so much of the Spanish one
That came as quite a surprise to me
Someone with no prior experience with Romance languages (like me with other Germanic ones) might not understand so much however
Ah so the Dutch is actually very similar
The only thing I didn't understand was the *ontvang/ontvangen*. So I just kind of ignored it
My word-for-word understanding was:
South Africa is one of the most ethnic diverse lands(=countries
) in Africa
The land(=country) has/had more European immigrants ??? as(=than
) any other land(=country) in Africa
I'd love to find some more example like this where they're so similar to understand
It's pretty fun haha
Same
Some make more sense depending on the context
E.g. "met ongeveer 63,7 miljoen inwoners". I knew what this meant but didn't know how to translate "ongeveer" and "inwoners". But then I saw the breakdown on a constituent country basis, "Engeland in het zuiden (53
012
456 inwoners)" and I realised that "inwoners" means "inhabitants".
I agree
Plus *Vem* looks pretty similar to *whom* in English as well
So really it's just German being awkward here haha
Not really
I certainly have some clothes that are comfier than others and I wear them more often at home but I still do wear them out
The only clothes I have that I would never wear outside the house are some old worn clothes that I might wear if I was painting the fence or something so as not to ruin my proper clothes
Our national anthem actually has a verse about 'rebellious Scots to crush' I believe
Its just a shit national anthem all round and should be replaced with Jerusalem (nice and short) or Land of Hope and Glory
Also one of our favourite Christmas songs has the phrase 'cheap, lousy fa _ _ ot' in it
[ \- 'Roast Beef of Old England" says England beat France in Wars because we have better food
[ \- Two world wars and one world cup (Anti Germany football chant)
[ \- The National Anthem including the deleted verse about crushing rebellious Scots
[ Every song written by Northern Irish Unionists, but particularly '50p flute', which contains the chorus "fuck the Pope and the IRA
10 German Bombers, caused a storm when England fans sung it in Dortmund a few years back
Plus, before the 2006 WC our FA warned fans not to sing it, they did anyway ofc
Maybe I’m of a different time, but at school we used to sing that and Hitler’s only got one ball on the playground
To me it’s just a silly school song
In reference to OP, we have our own slew of anti-Irish ones
Including ‘no surrender to the IRA’, ‘fuck the IRA’, ‘fuck the Pope’ etc
Thankfully when we played each other a few years back in Dublin, we behaved
Although when England played Scotland at Celtic Park it was a different matter
Personally I find England fans who act like Rangers fans abroad as just embarrassing
Why you singing about the Pope in fucking 2019
As an English raised Catholic I just find the situation bemusing
I can appreciate the Black and Tans one, because they were bastards and deserved it
But it was slightly jarring walking to a music festival in the summer and a group of Irish lads were chanting ‘fuck your Union Jack, we want our country back’. Not necessarily offensive, but why you singing that at a fucking musical festival ?
"Rule Britannia" is pretty damn nationalistic, though I'm not sure if anyone would actually get offended by it
Every other comment about their mildly racist songs: How quaint and harmless
German  comment about mildly racist song: **Concern**
The verse is an alternative verse that was created during the Jacobite Rebellion and the song itself become widely popular as a result; the original song was created further back though we don't know when
I think we should keep it as the UK anthem but instate Jerusalem as the English anthem
I heard 50p flute in Sunderland as an anti geordie song
The last line was 'Fuck the Toon and the Toon Army'
That line hasn’t been a part of the anthem for centuries
It was added in by an anti-Jacobite
cheers u/thecockmeister
They have a Simply the Best knock-off which is hideous but 50p flute is a banger (and my family are Catholics so I probably shouldn't think that )
The flute one is class to be fair
I wouldn't be surprised if they got that from Rangers fans tbh
A line added due to anti-Jacobite sentiment centuries ago and has never been officially used, or widely used at all since the 19th century
I get your point but it’s not quite the same
Still are
They sure are a contentious people
Our anti french songs are much better, because they annoy the French not only in terms of talking about beating you in wars, but uses your own insult about English food to claim that English food is better than French food
"When mighty Roast Beef was the Englishman's food,
It ennobled our brains and enriched our blood
Our soldiers were brave and our courtiers were good
the Roast Beef of old England, And old English Roast
Beef
But since we have learnt from all-vapouring France
To eat their ragouts as well as to dance,
We're fed up with nothing but vain complaisance
the Roast Beef of Old England, And old English Roast Beef
Tbf Put Em Under Pressure isn't terrible either
Nonsense we never did anything wrong, now watch this gently amusing Hugh Grant movie while we play with these maps over here
My first HOI4 game was Portugal because I knew that they were neutral in the Second World War so it would give me a chance to learn the game before being bumfucked by the Axis
My first CK2 game was as Mumu in Ireland as it came highly recommended to new players
My first EU4 game was as England because I knew it had a mission to force a personal union with France *and I simply couldn’t resist subjugating the French*.
I only play CK2 and I'm still pretty much a novice I would say
My only strategy is 'keep my head down and develop internally'. I'm not very good at invasions, so I prefer to expand through scheming and marriages
So far, I've found the Leon tutorial and the French duchies (Champagne specifically) the easiest because their medium size makes them more manageable than the larger states, but they're still just big enough to make an invasion logistically difficult for the AI to pursue
I only play EUIV
Mostly choose small countries with big potential and I also hate blobbing unless I'm playing a country that historically blobbed e.g. Muscovy
I also like to colonise
Fave countries are Florence, Milan, Holland, Portugal, Sweden, Muscovy, England
That's probably in order as well
From the UK: well I know that in Wales, there is llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch and I think it's the longest in Europe
I could be wrong tho
Liverpool
I was planning a roadtrip to Scotland in May, first stop on the way there from the South West is Liverpool and I will definitely be going as soon as bars, hotels and most importantly, Scotland allows me to come
I'm moving to Liverpool in September, if that counts
We'd been planning a family holiday to the Harz mountains, probably Wernigerode, for this summer
So probably that
Will travelling be as free and easy as before
We tend to travel by train if it's possible, so that part shouldn't change, but what changes a hard no-deal Brexit will bring in January, who knows
Bruges
Its really pretty and quite easy to get to from England
Hope you have a great time here
Up the villa
Unfortunately our roadtrip is quite squeezed to Friday to Friday so we were planning having Friday day and night there and then all of Sat and off toward Scotland Sunday morning
I’ve got lots planned
I’ve only been up North twice before and i’ve heard a lot of good things about Liverpool so i’m pretty excited
Let me know if you have any recommendations
Thanks for the warning
Planning to come up on a Friday so hopefully it won’t be too bad
But sure i’ll hit some traffic as will be coming from Somerset
Cannot wait
When I was in Switzerland I visited this town called Gstaad just because I had seen photos of it and it looked nice (as most places do in Switzerland) I didn't know it was an upscale resort town for a lot of celebrities and royalty
It's a tiny town and all the shops were like Prada and Louis Vuitton haha Although the only thing I saw that was noteworthy was what looked like a lost dog
In rugby I do
If England are out, I'll support any Northern Hemisphere team to win it
In football it's different
A) Because the rivalries are a lot more heated B) Our neighbours don't always qualify for major tournaments
For example in the 2016 Euros, I didn't support Wales when England got knocked out
Mainly because it hurt they got further than us, but also because their team and fans celebrated so much when we lost
I don't blame them ofc, that's what Football is all about
Similarly, I hope Scotland don't qualify for Euro 2020
I did cheer on Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland though
Scotland, Wales and NI
Ireland a bit as well
I used to until I saw England play when I was in a pub in Wales and realised the vitriol they had
Was told it's the same in Scotland
Not any more
>Wales
>Ireland
>NI
>Scotland
In the 2020 euros it's going to be Finland because
I support the underdog
I'll cheer for the team/country I like the best still in the tournament
Doesn't have to be a neighbour
Yes but of course not as strongly as I would support England
I generally go for the underdogs, but I also will go for anyone with Arsenal players playing for them
Also anybody playing against Wales/Scotland/Northern Ireland
Heartbroken
fine then, be that way
>Anyone playing against England
Not fair, you lot never qualify for anything so we don't get to do the same to you :(
Ah yes, the famous England Spain football rivalry
cheers
just disappointed
Can’t have watched us recently then
The sheer amount of McDonalds in Italy
For a nation that’s so renowned for it’s food it was shocking to see how many Golden Arches there are in Rome and Florence
There’s a McDonalds inside the train station in Florence, then another two within direct eyesight as soon as you exit
Crazy
>Portugal
I lived in lisbon for a while and the thing that surprised me most was how immature the men were
A lot of them were quite disgusting to women and they seemed really chauvinistic and old fashioned
Ive never lived in Portugal, but I've had a few holidays there, and it's the worst country I've been to in terms of there being constant low level sexual harassment
I’ve heard the stereotype about us having carpet in our bathrooms
my grandma had carpet in her downstairs toilet but other than that I’ve never seen it in any house I’ve ever been in in the UK
> **England (a small West Midlands university town)**   : people drinking in Saturday morning
Super weird
People thinking that "having fun" = "drink so much that you vomit on the street and then pee or poop in the bushes". And not only silly students, but 50 year old guys
drinking culture is one thing, making yourself like this is another
Sounds like Leam
There are pubs and then there are pubs
The trick is knowing the difference between the two
My home town is pretty rural at 90k people
I can walk 20 mins in one direction and see nothing but hills and fields and 25 mins in the other and be in the town centre
It's when you hit someone in the face with a glass
Monaco: Rich
Liechtenstein: Tiny German place
Vatican City: Pope
Andorra: Skiing
Luxembourg: EU and rich
San Marino: I know it's in Italy
that's it
>the hilarious story of 80 soldiers that they sent to the Austro-Prussian war and were back with 81 lol
I would love to hear this story
A wee state
Sorry, would you prefer little state
The WW3 "Hype" is ridiculous, nobody is going to launch Nukes over Iran
That being said, asymmetric responses are definitely going to happen, and we'll probably see some attacks on US personnel worldwide
>US trying to force a war to the limit
Always good to be reelected as President
Lyndon B Johnson (Vietnam president) lost his bid for reelection, hell, he lost in the primaries before election season even properly began
There is no recurring pattern of wars reelecting presidents, thankfully
Iran has it's own interests in Iraq
Like the other user mentioned, you cant "clean up" Iraq without getting involved with Iran
It's like trying to involve yourself in Canada without the USA getting involved
>This is exactly the reason why we're out of NATO,
Well, Finlandization might be part of it too
The issue for healthcare in the US isnt money
The USA's federal budget for Medicare and Medicaid is already *way* bigger than their military budget
>Medicare spending grew 6
4% to **$750
2 billion** in 2018, or 21% of total NHE, while Medicaid spending grew 3
0% to **$597
4 billion** in 2018, or 16% of total NHE
Combined, the two surpass a trillion USD and are bigger than the Military budget by hundreds of billions of US dollars
The American government needs to reform how healthcare related products are priced in its country, and probably revamp Medicaid and Medicare (programs started in the 1960s) entirely, simply throwing more money at the problem will accomplish nothing for them
>oil prices going up again, congrats US
Based Yanks helping fight climate change by making oil too expensive to rely on anymore, thereby incentivizing the use of alternative energy sources
Trump was a Green Crusader all along
Why would they reinstate conscription
Has everyone forgotten about Vietnam
Conscripts get angry and murder their officers, volunteers are disciplined and obey their orders
The US government wont conscript anyone, because conscription is what triggers mass protests and unrest in the country
With the current setup, professional soldiers are living in a different world from the civilians
When they die, only a small bit of the population feel it, and the rest of the country doesnt notice it or care much
>fascist lies
Fucks sake people, not everything is Fascism
Wasnt Nixon re-elected on the promise to *end* the american role in the Vietnam war (Kissinger's role in the Paris peace talks aside)
Scotland
Hopefully an EU army
i’d happily be a collaborator at this point
Probably Russia if we don't stop being so aggressive towards them
Bloody Fritz…
England doesn't get invaded
We invade other people
Probably would assume France though, because Germany don't have much of a military, and they are desperate to steal the recipes for our food, want to drink our English Sparkling Wine,  and they are jealous because Cheddar is the best cheese in the world
We're more likely going to have Civil Tuting wars over brexit at the moment, but maybe when the money runs out
How would England invade on our own
it would be the UK
Not Azerbaijan
Instructions unclear, got invaded by Moldova
Besides, France are really bad at fighting England, you couldn't even kill Sean Bean and he dies in everything he has ever been in
>England
Not the UK

We could solve the Ukraine/Russia problem by retaking Sevastopol
I think Crimea would be a great Overseas British Territory holiday resort after Brexit, all the Spanish users on here will tell you how great Brits on holiday are for a place
Maybe you could go all Mad Max and add spikes to your bikes
Irelands our backdoor back in
ffs have to invade Portugal, Spain and Belgium to deal with France again then
France are not that scary, they couldn't even kill Sean Bean ffs
Crimea is as British as Sobraine Cigarettes (they are being sold in Ukraine as 'Sobraine London' now
Nah, heard he's going to become Singapore-on-Thames, will probably trade them in for a younger Thai wife
Yes, we have 'greasy spoon' cafes (actually places to get food, they might sell coffee but it's always the instant stuff) in most neighbourhoods and on major road routes
They typically will do an English Breakfast all day, and some other traditional British foods (but never fish and chips), for example Sheppard's Pie or Cottage Pie (neither of which are actually pies, they are meat with potatoes on top)
They are mostly just for breakfast and lunch tho
>in the original English version he has a "northern"? English accent
Brits plz correct me
He be from the West Country
Pretty much nailed it then
The stereotypical pirate accent is West country, Blackbeard was a Bristolian so I'm guessing that's why Robert Newton adopted it in the film Treasure Island (which is where we get the 'pirate accent' from)
In Primary school we had backpacks but did have ‘trays’ or ‘drawers’ which we could use, i think for our books
In secondary we just had backbacks, our text books generally stayed in the class rooms
Think we took home our exercise books though that we worked in
In college there were lockers which you could rent for a £5 refundable deposit but i didn’t bother
Yes but nobody uses them past year 7 (the first year of secondary school, aged 11-16)
Everyone I know just stopped using them entirely aged like 12, some people may use them to store weed / pe bags but everyone carries around the books in a backpack / a lot of girls use handbags
in primary (4-11) we had some ‘pigeon holes’ at the end but most schools just cba with them
We had lockers in year 7 (age 11-12) it was the first year of going to "big" school
It was quite a weird thing to have I think, meant mainly for PE kits but I don't think many people actually used them
I don't know any other schools in my area that had them so I think we were a bit weird for having them
Yes, only in secondary schools but we dont tend to use them that much
(Its mainly the year sevens
) And atleast in mine, you have to pay
The thing is that at my school you didn't really end up having to carry around that many books
Most textbooks we're communal and kept in that subjects classroom and were handed out when they were to be used
So there were no heavy textbooks to carry
We had small workbooks to write in but as I say they were small and you'd only have to take the ones for the lessons you had that day
And quite often the teacher would take them in to mark them
However I did find that when I was at college (age 16 - 18) I had to do lots of revision so ended up carrying around huge binders of notes and my own personal textbooks to use for revision
I also took my laptop
I feel I may have permanently stunted my growth from carrying around a 10kg bag every day lol
That's the same with my school
And as an excited year 7 I got one
Never used it, so let a mate borrow it
They lost BOTH KEYS (they were both on the same Keyring but they said they took it off, and then 'their siblings lost them both') Endless to say, I don't trust them anymore, and I dont trust no one anymore
And I still dont have a locker because it was a waste of money
Another short story is my sister's got broken into, and they broke the lock which was a Primark Hedwig one so she was heart broken
Luckily she had like nothing in it
Edit: I think I should add: The school doesn't supply us with a lock or key, we had to buy them ourselves
I also had to leave the lock on it, as I had no key which must have bugged the school as they had to break the lock to free the locker lol
Yeah growing up in the 90s for me a billion meant 'a million millions' but by 2000 that had changed to a billion being 'a thousand millions'
> no one knows or uses that system anymore
Not entirely true
That was the system I (21) first learnt at home from my parents
Of course, I wouldn't *use* it now but I wouldn't be surprised if there were other cases of it being informally passed down outside of school
The sun never setting…god couldn't trust us in the dark
Far right racist nationalists, alcoholism, chavs and the stupid things people from my country do abroad
To all of Europe, on behalf of England, I deeply apologise
Baked bean consumption
90% of the Netherlands claim to be able to speak English
The sun never sets on the empire
Because we can't be trusted in the dark…
Brexit, gladly
Scotland does have a weird accent but I wouldn’t call it German
if you could ask people who know about the music "which nation has had the biggest contribution to electronic music
" it would be, without a doubt, the UK
however, as per the examples people are giving, we don't really provide the huge names - probably something to do with our scenes not wanting to support those who try to repackage our culture for the masses
The problem is you tried to do it in Europe
don’t shit where you eat said the french and British
Yes, we are lucky
Can confirm
Have captured 13 German beach towel deckchairs this morning
definitely stretching the term "culture" with those artists as well
We're more known for jungle and garage also
Finders keepers
True but it always goes wrong in Europe eventually
Most people would, or more usually a less formal 'cheers' or 'ta'.
Up North, it's unusual if you dont say 'Cheers mate' or something along those lines
It's the norm in Yorkshire but I always procrastinate saying it and then I'm already off the bus and I haven't said it and now I feel like a dickhead for not saying thanks
I'm a very anxious person
>yelling
Hardly yelling lol, just saying a normal speaking volume while getting off
Right, I see lol
All the busses I have been on you walk right by the driver and the driver can easily hear you
As we established later on, we have different styles of bus
In all busses I have been on you walk straight past the driver who could easily hear
London buses however you exit from the side or back
The only way I have ever even bought a ticket for a bus is by directly buying it off the driver
Riot Games is also refusing to acknowledge Hong Kong, referring to a LoL team called "Hong Kong Attitude" as only "HKA" but they've avoided most of the controversy because they've made no big moves regarding the drama
EPIC or rather Tim Sweeney, on the other hand, have publicly stated that they will support free speech, including those criticising China despite being 40% owned by Tencent
It's quite sad, I think I wont be spending any money on Activision or Blizzard any time soon now
I support HK, but this seems like a typical reddit Echo chamber drama
As much as I believe Blizzard are in the wrong, I do not wish to get involved here
Blizzard, or indeed any company, should not censor people based on viewpoints aslong as it isn't extreme/racist/Fascist
This goes both ways, for example do you think there would be as much backlash if Blizzard banned someone for supporting China
Reddit loves to do stuff like this, they make some massive echo chamber about how evil a company/person is, and barely even make any difference
Admittedly a gaming company would be affected much more than say Nestlé or the Chinese government, but the point still stands
So irl I stand with HK, I have protested with thousands of others here who view the protesters and what they stand for as an inspiration, but it is important that we actually do something and not just create a huge echo chamber over it
Oh yeah I completely agree that they overreacted, no idea why they were so harsh, but I guess they really want the lucrative Chinese Market
Definitely uncalled for
China may soon be the world's largest superpower
It has a strong Economy, Influential politians and a huge profesional military
They can spread there power in many ways
Many countries are dependant on China, the Chinese not only manufacture a great amount of products, but also invest in most countries, I went to a brilliant lecture about this
The Chinese have investment banks across the globe, and a good amount of the global economy is supported by them
China will be a superpower, and it won't just be a cold war situation again
Unlike the 20th century the entire world is interdependent, it won't be a bipolar world
Have to be honest, Myanmar’s borders look cool
The island of Great Britain does look like a dragon kneeling down begging to be fed
Uzbekistan challenges you to a boot fight
Oh yeah i never saw it before lol
It's bad
It's not Turkey's place to do this
It's upsetting and infuriating
This is not at all acceptable
>Couple that with the fact that the US is basically pulling back our forces and our interests from the region, and Europe's inability to actually accomplish much of anything in the Med without the US being there, and that would mean that most of the Eastern Med would be solidly under the control of Russia and Turkey
Solidly is not accurate, Russia isn't in a position to beat the UK Royal Navy, or the French Navy, but the position of Turkey is certainly key to ensuring Russia currently has minimal influence in that region, the UK also has sovereign airbase areas in Cyprus so has much better air coverage than Russia would, but it would still become a huge headache, and would make Gibraltar even more important strategically to restrict access to the English channel and Atlantic
Firstly, you are hypocrites for supporting Northern Cyprus and then claiming 'territorial integrity' means the Kurds cannot leave Turkey
I've been to Mardin personally, Diyarbakir too, these are not Turkish cities and the people there mostly hate Turkey,
&#x200B;
But anyway there's no such thing as 'territorial integrity' or constitutions granting you the right to land, there are only things countries can do, and things countries cannot do
For example, if Turkey wanted to invade the Republic of Cyprus, they could beat the Cypriot Military for sure, and the Greek military too if they helped, and ignoring the fact you'd be attacking a UN peacekeeping mission, which would get you condemned and under sanctions, even if the UN were not there, you couldn't actually do it, because the UK claims airbases there are sovereign territory, and therefore you'd end up getting destroyed
The point I'm making is that the Turkish constitution doesn't matter, the reason the Kurds can't have a state is that the Turkish army would destroy them if they tried
Ive three questions
To any a non-native English speakers reading:
What did the English language sound like to you before you learned English
And also what does English sound like to your non-native ears
, is it a harsh or soft sounding language and when an English speakers speaks what do they sound like
, And in general what sounds/noises do you associate with English
What did the various English accents(English/Welsh/Irish/Scottish/American/Canadian/Australian/New Zealand) etc sound like to you before you learned English
, Could you differentiate them
And lastly does English sound like a Germanic language to your ears
That and Scandi's. Swedes have impeccable English
It still pretty much is for me too
Its really expensive so many other european countries often come up first by default i think
We say "pop your clogs" in english
lol neeeerds
Essex, they're like the Florida of England
I hear you, but I'd submit Northern Ireland as being "odd one out" as well
Literally, in that it's the only bit not on the island of Great Britain, but also its complex political situation makes it a special case in just about every way
Its nice to know it’s not just us who struggle
I'd say Essex is more like the stereotype of New Jersey rather than Florida
Yeah, when people not from the South talk about "the South" what they mean is "London and the home counties" and not regions like the West Country, East Anglia or the Midlands
Agreed
What would you say should be Florida, perhaps Newcastle
As much as it shames me to admit it, I kinda wanna say my own county of Norfolk
Both swampy and coastal, both sort of out on their own away from the rest of the country, both renowned for being full of weirdos (think Florida Man and Normal for Norfolk), both places old people retire to, plus having grown up there I can safely say that people here like ketamine just as much as Floridians like meth
You'd literally give your country up to another nation
Same, as someone from Norfolk which is basically as rural as it gets
Like I'm fairly sure Norwich's tallest building is still the Cathedral and that's from the Middle Ages
To be honest, I only really count Suffolk and Norfolk as being proper East Anglia, don't think about Bedford at all
I lived in Oberwart for a year back in 1999-2000 - fascinating little place
I didn't recall it having an official romani name at the time, but there had been an anti-romani bombing there in recent years, so maybe that drew a bit more attention to things
But there is 0 chance a majority of people in Orkney and Shetland want to be Norwegian
They're Scots
Scots with a Nordic heritage, but Scots nonetheless
For me, it is british drill music
It’s like an evolved version of grime and garage but it’s honestly awful
It’s basically the music that the gangs make
No the worst in Norway is all that "kebabnorsk" music where they sing absolutely terribly and teenagers think it's cool but it's rubbish
And russemusikk
Sucks
Ah yes it still gives me shivers
It’s called “God Save The Queen”, and I’m an atheist and a republican
So yeah
I don’t really vibe with it
200,000
Wow
I don't feel like I've been here that long in the scheme of things but it's quintupled in that time
That is a lot
I hope the friendly small community feel can be kept at this fast growth pace
That's really what drew me to this sub
I suppose that makes us joining buddies :)
And talking of that, this has made me go reading through a bunch of my early comments and I did notice your name popping up in the same places a bit haha
> In my view, losing that would mean losing an essential part of the subreddit itself
I completely agree
And as far as I can tell you and the rest of the mod team seem to be doing your best at trying to retain this, so my thanks to you guys for that
Let's hope it can last for as long as possible
At least 5
In a normal supermarket, around 8 maybe
Options for local Sainsburys are;
Royal Gala
Braeburn
Pink Lady
Granny Smith
Jazz
Golden Delicious
'mini apples'
Kanzi
You also get most of those in an organic option
The only thing I have against those cups is they are too big
I always end up making like a pint of coffee
Where do you live that you don’t know what sports direct is
You can buy them at the shops if you like
They are just a brand tie-in rather than being sport related, and they're huge (1 pint or 568ml)
French people referring to themselves "as a French" isn't really 'correct' English but I suppose if enough of them keep doing it it will become correct
The 'proper' way is "as a Frenchman" or "as a Frenchwoman".
I have a trick to tell the difference between British fans and foreign fans on [r/soccer] even if they have a flair of an English club
Non-native speakers and americans will say "Liverpool **is** a football club" whereas we don't say that in the UK
It looks really jarring
We say "Liverpool **are** a football club". That's because in American English collective nouns use *is* whereas in British English collective nouns are referred to with *are
* I think what is happening is that non-native speakers are applying their own grammar rules to English or are just speaking American English
"how do you call it"
I see this with Chinese people more than anything
On any video related to Chinese politics or culture, half of the comments start with "I am a Chinese and
"Liverpool is a football club" is fine, but "Liverpool is 1-0 up" isn't.
The first is a singular entity, the latter a collection of people on a pitch, if that makes sense
Whereas "Oasis is a band" sounds OK but "The Beatles is a band" is weird because of the grammatical agreement
I try to use semicolons wherever possible; they look so much more sophisticated
Unless we're quids in of course
I'm not sure what they say in London but in West Yorkshire saying you're going to the seaside for your holidays makes perfect sense, I would probably say beach but many people use them interchangeably and nobody would misunderstand them
If you say whom you're a nonce
You gotcha
"The government are planning a new scheme" etc
You *can* do that in English if you try
You *shouldn't*, but you can
A lot of Indian standard English is very Victorian, presumably dating back to the Raj
While English in native-speaking countries has changed over the last century or so, English is basically no-one's first language in India and is solely taught as a lingua franca
So all thaf rather antiquated phrasing is just passed down from generation to generation, filtered through all the stuff in this thread about non-native speakers not *quite* getting it right
Because in example 1 and 3, "50-dollar" is being used as an adjective and should really be hyphenated
It's basically the point
It's supposed to be confrontational
it's you
Dont forget that many of these MPs are drunk outta their minds or at least well tipsy & buzzed as they're sat there because they have an open bar(payed for by the taxpayer i might add) where they can drink the finest booze all day for free(the same applies to their food too
Its all subsidized by the taxpayer, smh :/. They should get rid of the free booze and food, in no other line of work are you allowed to drink on the job or do you get free food) etc
but regarding the uncivilized nature
Its not helped by the fact that many MPs are clearly heavy drinkers and they get tanked up before entering the chamber for these big events, and alcohol is famous for lowering inhabitions
Hence the behaviour one sees on tv
Tbh it all just comes across as so childish and immature, all the jeering and infantile bantering, i mean if you behaved as these MPs in parliment do, behaved like that at your work or in school you'd be punished for it, yet our representitives in the highest offices of the land etc see nothing wrong in behaving like a bunch of drunkards and toddlers essentially
Its a joke tbh, shows how outta touch these elites are
Probably reminds them of their time at boarding school, its all a little fun game to them, when its real people's lives they have in their hands but they dont see it that way, smh :/ not to mention all the archaic procedures etc
The whole thing needs to be binned and reformed, rebooted from the ground up
Its the 21st century ffs
What was a Level 80 Daedric mace doing in the middle of the house﻿??, You cant blame the guy for wanting that sweet loot for himself
Just think of them OP stats
I think it's definitely a contributing factor
We don't have a great history of referendums and we don't have a developed culture or institutions around them like Switzerland
Have sex but make love :)

Mostly as a pin to wear around this time of year
But poppy seed bagels are fabulous
Iv seen that  doc
Yes but is quite a process
Also Belgium and France use it i believe but different colours
Im not 100% certian myself
Iv looked it up in the past but i cant remember
Theres ways to make opium tea by boiling them and if you score the seed pods and dry the gunk that oozes out you can make that into opium but its not that simple
Theres a sub called r/druggardening that could help also google is your friend
The poppy was the first thing to grow back in bomb craters which is why it was chosen as a symbol of hope and rememberance
I’d remove the troubles of Ireland
It was a complete mess and the IRAs bombings in London affected a lot of people I know
I think either the battle of Hastings, not taxing the 13 colonies and decolonising earlier
Why would you want to establish colonies in North America
Couldn't agree more, I'd say the Troubles also
Ww1 was happening anyway
The only way we would've avoided war is if germany didn't go through Belgium who I think we had a defensive pact with
There was quite a few
An underground station and dozens of buildings
The horse guards were also targeted with a nail bomb
Killed the queens horses
There are photographs but it’s sickening to see
Yeah and colonialism is bad
Ireland was colonised by Britain
They did know that if they entered Belgian territory they would be at war, I believe that we sent a warning after they declared war with Serbia which brought russia and France into the war
I guess that Belgium was more important and strategic than denmark
It was all a fucking mess
I’m sure the kid wasn’t the intended target but that’s just horrible
Conflict in urban areas always has innocent casualties
Belfast got hit really hard by terrorism :/
Right
but I’m sure we can all figure out where that leads
Why would an Irish person advocate colonisation given how much Ireland has suffered because of it
My stepmother as a child (is English but had family in Ireland) had a gun put to her head because she had an English accent
There was a lot of hate in people at the time and it’s still getting dragged into modern politics
It’s disgraceful
I’m from the opposite of the whole mess
A Protestant raised English lad
I’m for Irish independence but I think the British should have been a lot harder on the IRA
They became a terrorism group and should have been treated more like one
And a lot of people ignore the terrorism and it’s just sad
I know a few ex soldiers who went to Ireland who have ptsd from what they had to deal with
People forget half the history because it doesn’t suit their perfect vision of history
Because people ably see it from their side
The IRA were terrorists
The British treated Ireland badly
Ireland had issues because or religious bullshit
Britain had issues too
It would take too long to write out all of the context to the troubles as it was the build up of centuries of mistakes and atrocity on both sides
Goodnight mate
Sleep well
> **No, we don't walk on the left or the right
We are British and wander where we will**
> The British have little sense of pavement etiquette, preferring a slalom approach to pedestrian progress
When two strangers approach each other, it often results in the performance of a little gavotte as they double-guess in which direction the other will turn
At my school we're just a horde walking wherever in the hallways
There’s a rule in my school where you have to keep on the left when walking down a hallway
I think we do
To me, walking on the right hand side seems really unnatural and in most cases I think people walk broadly on the left although it isn't that ordered
Or when people won’t walk single file on a pavement next to a busy road
At high school it was like that but at sixth form we all walk on the left
That is unless it's really really busy
It is mostly viewed, alongside the Potsdam Conference, as setting the  stage for the Cold War and creating a commitment to prevent the expansion of communism around the world
Stalin took Romania and bounced on Churchill’s belly
Not striking a deal would have endangered countries like Greece however, the communists there were agitating for control
It was also Churchill who made sure Poland got compensated with German territory for the territory taken by the USSR directly
I’d like to copy the quality of being a country that people want to copy from
The cycling infrastructure of the Netherlands, please
I’d love lots more regional languages
The only other language that exists in England is the rarely spoken Cornish
I would absolutely adore a Yorkshire language
If that’s not possible, at least adopt more official languages (Welsh etc), it would give me a lot more motivation to learn a new language and would help in choosing it
The EU like most of europe
the Alps please
I like British food but honestly I’ve had some really nice stuff from foreign countries that they don’t do around here for whatever reason
Also better weather
(To be fair though today is actually quite nice)
pick the Brandenburg Airport in Berlin or the north-south metro in Amsterdam
Bucharest metro is pretty awesome
I haven't been on any other Romanain trains however, so this is probably a massively biased outlook
The tube is also amazing, but when you compare it to the likes of northernrail things start looking bleak
I assume the Basque flair is currently in jail
10/10 trolling
Ps British food is unironically not that bad
Can you only get a state pension in Greece
Are there no pension options available privately
In the UK you’re automatically enrolled in a pension at your job ( you can leave it if you want) which takes 6% of your salary and isn’t taxed
The company you work for also has to pay in the same amount
You’re also allowed to access it once you turn 55 I think
The state pension is then given to once you hit 65, soon to be 66
Although fuck knows what it’ll be when I’m older
Probably 70+.
Please expand
It's also the quality of it that makes a big difference with British food tbh, because you can make it with very cheap ingredients if you want, it just won't be as good
Even I wouldn't eat some of the concoctions that claim to be Cheddar in Europe
They use the term mean that rubber American style stuff
Dutch food or German food
After all, we did invent chips
How as it
British food has a wider variety of sauces with your potatoes and meat than German food, like we have curry sauces even in fish and chip shops
Also, we have English breakfasts, and they do not
That’s super cool
Lmao, is the British way
Don’t fix our own problems, just fuck over our enemies way more so they have to give in to our demands or needs one way or another
Mate you can't forget unicum
I am a native English speaker, and the people who have told me how easy English is do come across as arrogant
English is not the hardest language, but even small changes in the phrasing of a sentence can make the meaning completely different - ‘pissed’ vs ‘pissed off’ in British English
Phrasal verbs always seem to present a problem as well and can again change the meaning if the whole verb is not used
Advantages of English:
Very little to learn by way of genders of objects
Verb conjugation quite easy/
Grammatical cases have almost disappeared /
Shares words with many European languages as has Germanic and Romance influences/
No tones/
No mutations as in Celtic languages
Neutral:
There are more verb tenses than German, fewer verb tenses than Spanish
Disadvantages:
No consistency in orthography/
I think it is difficult to get the correct intonation and the language relies a lot on stress to communicate meaning/
Exact meaning of words can vary between dialects of English/
Pluricentric language, so no ‘correct’ way to learn English, no centralised body for spelling and grammar/
Need to appreciate the different ‘registers’ of English and when certain terms are appropriate/
Appreciation of cultural differences between different English-speaking countries (e.g. ‘liberal’ could be interpreted very differently in different countries’ and have almost the opposite meaning)
‘World English’ misses out a lot of the slang, nuance, colloquial language, idioms, etc
of English
English TV, computer games, etc
are everywhere, so learning material is very accessible, which can’t be said for a lot of languages
There is also a large pool of people to speak with
I’m a native English speaker and I feel bad for people who have to learn English because of our weird sound rules
I talked to my language teacher about it in school one time
I only speak english
I live there and always have lived there
I think the hardest thing about it is the ammount of exceptions and how so many sounds and letters dont follow the rules you are taught
God, as an actual English person I don’t know whether to be impressed or depressed that everyone seems to find English so easy
Dutch is very similar to English I've heard
I've only ever learned french and german and by far german is easier because it is germanic
I know more french though because I started learning it earlier
True
How hard your language is to learn totally depends on the native language of the person trying to learn it
In general, people who speak germanic languages will find it easier to learn germanic languages and the same is true for other language families
There are lots of English words that don’t make it to an official dictionary
That’s why we have urbandictionary :)
And you can practise your english in neighbouring countries
Scandinavia are always fond of speaking english
‘Quite simple’, but then your post has mistakes in it
This is exactly my point
German is harder than English
Albanian isn’t related to anything else, therefore it is harder as there are fewer conjugates with other languages to rely on
Most likely, your first language is German or Albanian, so they would obviously be easy for you
‘childlike’ : (
Jesus
Because Dutch is one of the closest languages to English
Not much of a surprise then that native Dutch speakers would find it easy
Unsurprisingly it is mainly speakers of Scandinavian languages and Dutch that find English easiest - if you google ‘map of Europe by lexical distances’, it is obvious why - the lexical distance between those languages is shortest
This had me
If you want
‘Well’ needs a comma after it /
‘decently German’ needs the order of the sentence changing, so ‘German decently’ /
‘The English grammar’ sounds awkward, surely just ‘English grammar’ /
‘Literal hell’. - ‘literally’ has now entered the dictionary as a word that adds emphasis, but if you read it using its traditional meaning, it does sound funny
I assume you didn’t actually have to go to Hell to learn German
‘Quite’ also means something different in the UK/USA, so I assume you mean the British version (obviously I am inclined to read it this way as I am British) /
While vs whereas
It works, but some style guides recommend you use ‘whereas’ here
So I would probably have written:
Well, I speak Albanian, English and German decently, and by far the easiest is English
The grammar of both Albanian and German was hell to learn, whereas English grammar was quite simple
I think this is true about dubs, but the power of the dub seems to be fading due to services such as Netflix
I know when I lived in Austria, cinemas also had screenings of dubbed versions of films and then the original language version in separate screenings
German grammar is harder than English and Dutch, which is why it is easier for a German to learn Dutch than the other way around
even speaking just English and German, it was not too difficult for me to understand Dutch with only a bit of practice
I remember, in Japanese class, having to read out the Japanese for CD player, '*See Dee pu ray ah*' and i felt like I was doing a comedy accent from some seventies’ comic's standup routine
Europeans complaining that Americans like capitalism
Americans complaining about knife crime in London
Less discussion of the Disney channel and how great it was for you growing up/how bad it is now
Less I’m a child of X decade and the boomers/millennials/generation who came before or after me were shit stuff in general
Less did you know The US is big stuff like I can drive 15 hours and still be in the same state
Best of all no Fahrenheit
/r/ShitAmericansSay would be more boring
Older people in the UK use fahrenheit too
My mum and her partner do occasionally
Sometimes they use fahrenheit, sometimes celcius
And there's no consistency as to when
Most of the time they'll say the temperature (weather) in celcius, but sometimes randomly drop fahrenheit in there
I always have to look it up afterwards
All I know is 32°F = 0°C. And I think 1°C is \~ 2
5°F, or thereabouts
I know Turkey is a Islamic country where circumcision and cut dicks are the majority norm etc
but despite that in Turkey are there men who for whatever reason dont get circumcised
, and how are those men viewed/treated by other Turks & by Turkish society/culture
, Also like do you know any Turkish men who are uncut
, And do many Turkish men wish they were not circumcised
, And lastly how is foreskin generally viewed in Turkey and what do people think of uncut dicks
Im just curious to know is all since the topic of foreskin has come up
Doesn't apply to Eastern Europe unfortunately
Mainly use Imperial
The window in my sisters room in my old house had a large window like this
There's no bath or sofa's in public toilets, so that's always annoyed me
or Bog
It's not
Not at all
Milan, Rome, Turin, Naples, Genoa
Seville is a bit changed (Sevilla), Majorca (Mallorca), Catalonia (Catalunya or Cataluña), Basque Country (País Vasco)
Granted they are much less adapted than the Italian ones mind
True i misread the title a bit but many of the posts are pretty similar ie munchen-munich
I think its more ‘was’ used in English, as I have never heard anyone call Aachen “Aix-la-Chapelle’. But the other ones are pretty spot on I would say
Someone once joked to be that french only uses about 11 letters and you only pronounce about 4 of them
england or the UK depending, but never 'great britain', it's totally redundant outside of geographical contexts
I usually just say England
if it's someone from outside the commonwealth I'm British, if not I'm English
England or the UK, I identify as English-only
I don't remotely identify with "Britishness" which has effectively been co-opted to just be middle and upper-class stereotypes though perhaps that is maybe what it always has been
England if I’m in Europe, UK if I’m in America
I don’t know anyone who says they’re from Great Britain
Tbh I only hear foreign media use the term Great Britain like that
“The UK” then if I get a blank stare “England”.
Saying I'm English comes more naturally
Of course I am British, but I'm always English first
It always seemed to eme a very middle class thing to identify as British first
I don't think I know anyone that would identify as British first
I say English
I'm from an Irish family that suffered under the British in N.Ireland so United Kingdom doesn't appeal to me, and by extension of that, British are 'the other side' over there, so I stick to calling myself English
Just personal preference, I don't care at all what labels other people give to themselves, to each their own
all three depending on context
i just say uk cause its short lol
Depends on context, but "I'm from England" is the most common "I'm from" I give
From England, I think that anyone who lives in the uk likes to identify with their own country
Britain, because  I'm not a monarchist and I'm 1/4 Welsh
To be honest with you, the main reason I pick England most of the time is that it tilts the shit out of people
Londoners mostly hate it, Scots hate it, Welsh hate it
It's great
I find 'England' is much more of a cultural 'in-out' group identifier than British tbh
It depends, it's a bit of a weird one, in terms of politics,  I would always say the UK, because England is not really a political entity, but in terms of Sport, Football etc, I would definitely identify as English
When I travel abroad, I normally say English, but it depends which country I'm in, how much of their language I know, and their political situation
There is definitely a class thing and a race thing about this though, black people in England are way more likely to call themselves British, not English, and middle class people will typically use British because English is associated with people who watch football, drink Carling etc
Also, if someone uses England not UK, it's a strong indicator they probably are right wing and voted to Leave the EU
Depends, if asked my nationality, I'm English, if asked my citizenship, I'm British
England or London, never really say Britain or UK
mostly england, sometimes UK, but my friend from America stopped talking to me after he found out I was from the uk
England, and I like when people from scotland say they're from scotland etc
If I was from sweden I wouldn't want to keep saying I'm from Scandinavia
It's kind of similar
kind of
I’d say England or UK
If someone from UK asked i’d say Somerset
Idk, mostly the U.K. but if it’s to people from close eg Scotland, wales, Ireland or France, I’ll say that I’m from England
Depends
Usually England, especially when a sporting event or something is imminent
Not often do I say I’m British but usually I do when it’s to a non native English speaker, but its England to a native speaker
However if its in and around the UK and Ireland I’ll probably say my hometown or county
¿Las españolas usualmente dicen “gran bretaña”, verdad
Which is exactly why I say I'm English
I hate the idea of letting racists win our flag and essentially our national identity
So I make it point of not being a racist twat whilst being English
The union jack is safe, that's why the middle class people like it
It's the great British bake off and london 2012
The St George's Cross is associated with football and those awful people from the estate that drink carling, that's why they don't like it
It's classist
I never understand this thinking really
There's of course more far right groups in England because we are the biggest populated country in the UK
Far right parties tend to be nationalist
of course they use their national flag
Every country has them and they tend to use their nation's flag
It's strange how Scottish nationalism is all about Scottish nationality and Scotland's flag but England cannot have its own nationality and cultural pride because of some small minority far right groups that aren't really relevant anymore
English nationalism, sometimes wanting England to be independent from the UK, is bad, but Scottish nationalism who want the same thing for Scotland is good
Of course there's some negative things about English nationalism but there's negatives like racism in all forms of far right nationalism around the world primary in more populated countries
England's far right nationalism should not represent the whole of English nationalism
Scottish and Welsh nationalism is all about celebrating their country and culture
There's absolutely no reason why England shouldn't be able to do the same and English people should be able to refer themselves as English
Say that to my face and not online
Great Britain is the bigger island, the north of the island is Scotland, the sticky out bit on the west is wales, and the rest is England
The other island west of the big island, the smaller island is Ireland and the tiny bit in the north of that is Northern Ireland, and the rest in Republic of Ireland, or just Ireland
usually when be people refer to britain or british people they mean the entire UK but when just talking about the island they are explicit and say Great Britain
The "Londoner not English" lot are even worse than the "Scouse not English" lot, and it's the best thing about using England, it tilts the shit out of you lot
Thanks
Sure, Emile Heskey, England 5- Germany 1
England Till I Die
Londoner isn't even encompassing though, my mum is from Barnet and has never called herself a Londoner
Millwall fans I know all use England too, thinking about it, same with everyone I know from Dagenham
I think Londoner or English has cultural and political connotations, if you call yourself a Londoner, I'm going to assume you are probably BME and politically left of centre and voted Remain, if you use English, the assumption is you are white, politically right of centre, and voted leave
Reddit does that a lot of the time
We are evil overlords keeping the Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish with us against their will apparently
Because it's their country
Pretty sure most Unionists in Northern Ireland don't hold Irish passports
They do if they choose the British passport
Why
It's the UK
I mean you don't have to hold a British passport, but legally speaking you are still British citizens
There was a court case recently when some republican girl tried to get her American partner a spousal visa using the EU citizen form with her Irish passport, not the British citizen spouse process, and lost an appeal in the courts on the grounds she was deemed a citizen
£1 = a pie from Gregg's.
£10 = a pie meal at a decent restaurant
£100 = 20 pies at Wembley stadium
£1 - A scratchcard
£10 - A round of drinks at Weatherspoon's
£100 - A night at a very cheap hotel and a meal for two at a restaurant
£1 - A scratch card
£10 - A round of drinks at Weatherspoon's

There was also a pie that cost £8000 once

That's pretty much the upper limit
Those things aren't what fun is all about
My school allows either
Handwritten Greek is weird
ψ looks like a “y” in cursive
We learnt a rlly simple joined up handwriting, not print but no where near cursive at about 7/8 but as soon as it comes to our main exams we’re taught to write in print if we’re in doubt about the legibility of our writing
We're encouraged to learn cursive (some schools basically force it some don't) before entering high school at age 11, but it never really becomes "the standard" way to write, at least in public schools
It's basically chaos
I first learned joined up writing, but later switched to not joined up writing
I find it really hard to write neatly, it literally takes all my concentration to do it
I find that writing non joined up, means I just have to hold that super focus for each letter, rather than a whole word at a time
What's the accent above the third 'Z' (Ż)
I know acute (é), grave (è), that triangular one they have in Spanish (ê) and the hanging one (ç), the other triangle in some Balkan languages (š), and the umlaut in German (ü)
Not sure I've seen a single dot before
Don't fancy it myself but I don't think it's *weird* of anything

no one likes the north
anywhere between the english midlands and scotland is usually the butt of many jokes
wales gets mocked a lot too, but in a weird endearing way where there's no real animosity
if we're talking about *memes* (shitty ones, albeit) probably scotland - take one look at r/ScottishPeopleFacebook and you'll see that the scots language just makes everything funnier somehow
also, slough
fuck slough
East anglia is full of inbreds and/or anywhere north of london is a shithole
And no-one ever mentions Stoke
I would've also said Chukotka and Chukchis as even we say those jokes (or at least used to)
If you're reading the above, you might correctly guess that it's is a very southern-centric view
Likewise, us northerners tend to joke about how soft and rude southerners are, it's all in good spirit though
For good reasons, let's be honest
i wish more people could stomach some good old regional hatred in the format of a joke without getting upset and taking it at face value, a lot of people here, in *wiltshire*, get sensitive about jokes about the north
not really sure why
i embrace the fake hatred we have for one another (usually fake, anyway)
also i don't drink water by itself so fuck it, good for you
dream on, serb
That's odd, Wiltshire is surely by no possible metric the North
Obviously I might be biased but I feel like up here we're quite good at taking jokes, we just give it straight back rather than getting offended in my experience
Also we joke about each other far more than we joke about the South anyway
in that way i actually favour the north, you seem to be a lot more humble than us
joke
to my understanding (correct me if i'm wrong) serbia want a reunion of yugoslavia but serbs, bosniaks and croats all sort of hate each other (or rather, can no longer live in the same space)
Newcastle-Upon-Tyne are the Geordies, Newcastle-Under-Lyme (near Stoke) aren't
i know vaguely about the history, just not the current ethnic situation, but that's about what i expected
Ah yeah, good shout, I'd forgotten that one
Absolutely not
I love my nation, and won't abandon it
Lol nope
For the simple reason that it wouldn't be home
And not only that, it would be very far from home
I'm very happy with where I live and wouldn't want to even move county, let alone halfway across the world
There are lots of issues with America that people like to bring up, but I really think this is the main reason for me
I would love to live in the US
It's been something of a pipe-dream for me since I was a kid
I'm a huge yankophile so I think I'd really enjoy it
However, I wouldn't be able to do it unless I had a sufficiently well-paying job, because I would become destitute under the US healthcare system
I would also struggle with the lack of holidays and the presence of guns
I'm gay too, and there are a number of places in the US where that becomes difficult legally
So as much as I am fascinated by the Unites States and love visiting, with my circumstances, I simply couldn't live there in its current state
No I'd get homesick
And it's too big and spread out with probably little to do if you aren't in a big city and I don't want to live in a big city
> anticonception
"contraception", btw
Probably either 'Sunday lunch'/roast dinner - for me it's usually beef/chicken/lamb etc with roast potatoes, roast parsnips, carrots, broccoli, stuffing, Yorkshire pudding and gravy)
Alternatively the famous British curries: chicken korma or chicken tikka masala
Edit: Also pies of any kind, particularly steak & ale, chicken and mushroom
For me it's melted cheese on two pieces of toast, topped with a tin of heinz baked beans
Easy to make, delicious
Don't @ me if you've never tried it
Is that really comfort food tho
It’s a whole shared family big meal
Indeed - as long as they aren't Richmond sausages
Definitely a classic
I have fond memories of steak and ale pie
Before the Rona' arrived I used to go to to a nice little pub once a month with my Grandad
We'd always go on a Thursday to get their 'pie of the day' special, which was a glorious steak and ale with the thickest crust you've ever seen
It was a proper pie too, not just stew with a pastry lid
Not weird at all
There are lots of misconceptions about British food
Yeah it's not as pretty as French or others, but it's tasty and filling, and for me that is the most important thing
Function over form
(As with a lot of British things)
Not really thought of as comfort food tho
They’re a bit of a faff to make
I suppose it's subjective really - usually it's just two of us having it on a rainy sunday afternoon
Because we speak English here are a couple of names we called differently as colonisers
Ghana: "Gold Coast"
Sri Lanka: "Ceylon"
Israel - palestine
So what would “the United Kingdom of Great British and Northern Ireland” be in polish
I think they meant like the official name in English
And I think they mean they want names that vary a lot from the English name with different etymology
Only if you're a feeble wet lettuce
What sort of man would be weak and insecure enough to be offended by such a statement
Thanks (x)
(Edit): sorry for the kiss
Been texting the mrs
You'd just have to be a total pussy to be offended by something like that
I can't empathise
Well I do like to keep my
Options open
That's so offensive

The Ghost Bus Tours - took me ages to figure out it wasa pun; I saw them driving round but it wasn't until I had cause to say it our loud that I realised
> In the UK it tends to be smaller owner-run businesses which have pun names
What, as opposed to supermarket chains
Have you never been to Spainsbury's?
There's a Jason Doner Van in Bristol
I don't think we really have one Big National Poem, because we've never had the experience most other European countries have had, of being oppressed and/or fragmented and finding an expression of natural identity to glom on to
I studied Beowulf at school, maybe in Year 8 from what I remember
You can find foxes in the middle of London here
It is not remotely unusual to find urban foxes sprawling all over our cities, many people do feed them and some even do so by hand
We obviously have the typical hedgehogs, squirrels and a wide array of species in our cities, but unlike others in Europe we also have urban muntjac deer though not to the degree of foxes
Foxes roam the streets at night in many parts of London
Saw one recently on my boyfriend’s street in North London and it wasn’t even properly dark out
We have villages and towns within national parks (I know America doesn't, not sure about other nations)
The New Forest national Park has a lot of wild ponies and horses
some wander around the towns
Yes
Im in pretty centralish London (like all the touristy things are within a 30 min bike ride)
Lots of cats, none feral and all belonging to various houses but you often see them out and about laying in the sun or sniffing bins
I have actually named many of the cats and will often stop and talk to them as thats just polite
Foxes are also pretty common in all British cities, some can look a little mangy but most often they look quite healthy
The local parks have ducks, geese, swans and various other small water birds and of course squirrels
Some parks further afield have deer that are essentially wild
You will also see the occasional mouse and more rarely a rat at an underground station
Deer  fox,rabbits, stoat, voles, hedgehogs, lizards, see all sorts in yorkshire, but most varied wildlife Is slightly away from the people
The towns and villages in the new forest get horses and ponies randomly walking down the High Street
I listen to some American hunting podcasts and even the yotes are becoming urbanised, they've been seen in central park and all across la and Hollywood
Canids are exceptional generalists and very adaptable
Utterly appalling, blatant in your face corruption
The human rights abuses to build these new stadiums is an utter disgrace
I am ashamed our FA aren't boycotting the entire thing
Honestly I have never understood this stereotype
Genuinely do not get it
Sure Italian food is great fairly consistently but Spanish and Greek food has always been a hit and miss for me and there are tons of dishes here in Britain and other stereotypically gloomy places that I think are fucking delicious
I've just never understood this belief
At all
Because they're made for the climate
I look at the window now and all i can see is mist and rain, its like walking through a wall of wetness when you go outside
This doesnt make me want to eat spicy 'exciting food', I want a shepherds pie to warm the coldness from me
I think this is why southern european food is more flamboyant, if you live somewhere where it is possible to eat outside and feel inspired to make a big deal about the delights of food then of course your cuisine is going to be more exciting
If you live somewhere where food is a comfort in the bleak midwinter then its going to be a bit more simple
[Steak and ale pie] and [cottage and shepherd's pie] I don't like them because by and large I don't like red meat
But they're certainly popular dishes
Have a go at making [Yorkshire pudding] some time
It's actually a savoury food, usually eaten with roast dinner on a Sunday
You can also make [toad in the hole] with it
I think it's because a lot of people seem to think that adding spices to something makes it objectively better
Also people seem to forget that we do use herbs in our cooking, and that it isn't completely unflavoured
Not quite
Even in the Medieval ages we loved spice and trade networks were there
If you read a lot of medieval European recipes they were often heavily spiced
Of course the upper classes would have had more access to spices than the lower classes, but the lower classes would have at least been aware or them
It was later on when spices became more prevalent that the idea of simple food and letting the ingredients speak for themselves became more popular, as the upper classes wanted to get away from the lower classes who could now afford spices like them
I mean in my opinion Spanish food has always been hit and miss for me
Iberico ham is fine
Just fine
And I've never had paella that was better than just okay
It's very often bland as hell
Croquetas on the other hand
jesus christ they need to be internationalised this instant
So good
That's a myth mate
People have known spoiled food makes you ill for centuries
Spicing it up wouldn't stop that
Besides, why would they waste expensive spices on spoiled food
People use spices because they like the taste
I mean, meat roasted in its own juices along with root vegetables and gravy made from the last three (dozen) roasts is pretty delicious
Man, I feel sorry for you
Its that meme that the medieval world was grey and bland
In reality people weren't much different from today
People loved colour and flavour
In addition to the spices from the trade routes there were also a lot of herbs and spices simply growing at the side of the road that people back in the day would have known about and used (and cultivated)
There is truth to this
When I roast beef I cook it to medium-rare
My nan says that's not "proper" and cooks it til it's grey
However in that sense I'm more of a traditionalist than her
When we were known across Europe for our expertise in roasting meats, we weren't roasting it like she does
The link to the past was severed and I suppose the younger generations are more interested in bringing it back
We have so many loan words in English ironically
Mostly French
There isn't one to that level
Pretty much everyone is hated by someone
Our country's big hero is Winston Churchill but I don't even like him and like 10% of people dont
The queen
A lot of the older generation idolise her as someone that somehow keeps the country together
When no she does literally nothing
In the UK we have these people called "chavs" who are basically British rednecks or our version of Russian gopniks
They're ultra nationalist and always go on about how we're going to get revenge on Germany for WW2 because they apparently said they want an endless war
They hate Germany for everything, not just WW2
Unfortunately every country has its own version of rednecks and they're always just as dumb
You'll see them in comment sections making comments like "HA GERMANY WANT ENDLESS WAR LET'S DO IT AGAIN REVENGE
yes
Brexit
Every country in Europe is effected immeasurably by WW2
We hate you less than we hate france Germany
So chavs are all lovely and totally not nationalist or racist
Alright then, I'll find some African dude to show them
I'm sure he'll love it
Also those people definitely aren't conservatives
I mean technically we still have some semblance of an empire
It's mostly constituted by tiny islands, the inhabitants of which we fuck over just because we can
The British political establishment is horrendous
How in any way
Our last significant imperial poessison was Hong Kong which went in 97
Our Empire has been long gone for ages
I most mostly talking about the native inhabitants
Chagossians for instance
I think this is very apparent on some of the fashion based Subreddits like r/streetwear or r/sneakers were it's almost all American fashion so for example with trainers like Jordans ect whereas in Europe Adidas originals are much more popular
The most depressing place In the world
Full of smug nasty bellends
Avoid at all costs

My bank account is crying I'd say expensive rather than rich
Are you implying that Glasweigan is a dialect of Scots and not an ancient language of the great old ones
Plurality yes, majority, no
Mixing up Portsmouth and Southampton is criminal tbh
Also, Portsmouth is probably literally the least posh place in the South
It does however have the most pubs per square mile in the UK
It's the kind of place where you can get a £1
29 pint in the Spoons and a £1
99 pint in a non chain pub
Portsmouth is also the ferries one, Southampton is cruise ships and freight, if you wanted to get a normal Ferry to Spain or France, you'd leave from Portsmouth, not Southampton
Its not a majority of the electorate if it isn't over 50 percent
That is a plurality
Plurality: "the number of votes cast for a candidate who receives more than any other but does not receive an absolute majority
For example, Theresa May had a plurality of seats and of votes in 2017, but not a absolute majority of either
In 2019, Boris Johnson had an absolute majority of seats, but only a plurality of the UK vote, not a majority
Hopefully we rejoin in a few years when all the old xenophobes die off
Don’t think so mate
Would it be correct to say that Spain - for the foreseeable future - *cannot* recognise Kosovo (from a political standpoint), due to the similarities between Kosovo and Catalonia
If Spain were to recognise Kosovo then, were Catalonia able to successfully declare unilateral independence and apply for EU membership, it would be harder for Spain to block their entry as others would point to Kosovo as a precedent in this hypothetical situation
Becuase they're French
The same thing happened with English and Norman French
The Norman conquerors and aristocracy over time came to speak the peasants' language, English
Cogito ergo fucking sum
Contrary to reddit memes, most British Baby Boomers grew up during the age of decolonisation and when the zeitgeist was overwhelmingly anti-empire and in favour "the bright future", so they largely don't "want it all back". Everyone forgets that Baby Boomers and Gen X formed the Hippy movement and all those young people protesting in front of South Africa and Rhodesia's embassies in the 1960s-90s.
The generation that fought in WW2 don't really comment on it too much in my experience
I've talked with a few WWII veterans and none of them regret fighting WW2 despite it bankrupting the UK and ultimately causing the Empire to dissolve, but I wager a lot of them preferred being a dominant power and do somewhat feel that Victory in 1945 was bittersweet, since it spelled the terminal decline of their country
One of them was a big fan of France, because he said the Suez Canal Crisis proved that the USA "betrayed us just to win over and please the Arabs" and that France "understood the fairness and justice of taking back the Canal they built and that we paid for" (his words and views, not mine)
I wouldn't say we view it was a shameful but rather a period of history that has no bearing on our daily lives
>  she considers them ingrates as she believes that the french occupation of Algeria was done with the purpose of helping local population ("we were just helping and they kicked us out" is a sentence I've heard a lot)
Reminds me of this clip from a French comedy show
I’d say I’m simultaneously proud that we managed to achieve such a feat, and ashamed that we did
You have a good claim to Shetland, might be a good time to ask for it back
It's less talked about than the EU, that's for sure
People know that Canada, Australia and New Zealand share a monarch with us and that you guys spell things the British-Oxford way rather than the Webster-American way
Other than that, Canada is seen as pretty "American" (Ice Hockey isn't really big in the UK, driving on the other side of the road, accents are way different, etc
) while Australia and NZ are much more familiar to us in terms of culture (closer accents, closer slang, rugby, cricket, driving, school uniform styles, etc)
> that would definitely be considered a weird position in Italy
One enthusiastically embraced by the Fascist regime, and by nobody else since
Depends imo, plenty of Italians I've met are pretty proud to say they are the direct heirs of the Romans
"While Germanics shit in the woods, we built the Colosseum" is a common comeback, whenever people accuse southern Europeans of being lazy or "not paying their debt".
So, what went on in the 1960s that triggered this "rebranding"?
Me too, could this be my way to retain EU citizenship
Well, I guess some of these changes make sense, because of your dual identity with Quebec
I assume the French speaking Quebecois never liked the Maple Leaf Forever too much ("Wolfe the dauntless hero" might not be popular in the place he conquered) and they probably didn't like the Red Ensign flag with the Union Jack either
Obviously as an English person, I think it's really cool that you guys still had an attachment to the Old Country back in the days, but if you have to choose between pleasing Quebec and the UK, obviously you must choose Quebec
The Dominion of Canada does sound a lot cooler than just Canada though
As an Englishman, this makes me really sad
Fuck brexit and fuck Boris

I think Colin Furze, a maniac fueled on tea represents Britain perfectly
I moved from the UK to Portugal for 2 years, and frankly it was pretty horrifying
I moved for the sake of my partner, who had found a job out there, and I worked remotely so in theory I was in a good position to emmigrate somewhere else
Wrong
Without a job outside of my apartment, there was no opportunity to go outside, meet people, and form my own life with people outside of my relationship
I became unhealthily dependent on my partner, after the few attempts I'd made at finding some semblence of a social life failed
It's more difficult than I had realised to extracate yourself from one support system, and try and implant yourself into another one - especially if it's among people who barely speak your language, and many aren't even willing to try
This isn't a gripe against the Portuguese - they were helpful where they could be, and no one was overtly rude, but it felt far away from being welcomed with open arms
It can work well for some people, clearly
But it didn't work for me
My relationship of 8 years crashed and burned, and now I'm back living in the UK while he's still out there
(He had a great time
He found himself, and feels that Lisbon is perfect for him
His answer would be a lot more positive than mine
Technically probably [Cry Baby by Jemini] which scored a big fat zero in 2003
However, I don't think it's actively a *bad* song, just a disastrous performance on the night
To be clear, it's not great, it's [insipid and forgettable ] but it's... OK
I don't, however think there's any salvaging [Daz Sampson's "Teenage Life"] from 2006
Which one
Because it’s career suicide and no one in their right mind would do it if they were at all respectable in the music industry
I don't think it *helped* but ... did you hear the song
Yeah, at least Flying the Flag was a bit self-aware
Also, I'd add, the public perception of Eurovision is stuck in about 1975 with lamé costumes, nonsense "bing-bang-a-bong" lyrics and wobbly cardboard sets
"It's very Eurovision" is *never* a compliment
Which I think is probably part of Britain's massive superiority complex, which thinks that we're so much better than all those funny foreigners with their funny foreign ways and gobbledegook languages
This is a very true and fair perception but why/how does a Portuguese dude or dudette know so much about national British eurovision sentiments
I think a lot of people will already know this, but literally like 90% of people will wear one for like 2 weeks within November, especially at formal shit and at schools
Yeah
I respect for soldiers who didn’t even properly know what they were signing up for go to war to defend the world
Uk btw
As a Brit, yes, but I think that really is a thing that we just do
They're always selling them at schools or at shop counters for 50p or £1
Almost everyone wears one, mostly for appearances
Irishmen weren't even drafted
Many volunteered and got shat on when they got home
I have never once seen this
Or even heard about it
Have you not seen our dress uniforms
Op also said traditional
How you could you be so wrong in such a short response
Have you ever had someone come up to you, in real life, and say 'shame on you' for not wearing one
Have you ever witnessed it in person happen to someone else
In 36 years, I have never once seen this
So either you live in a very fucked up part of the country, or, more likely, this is bull
Hardly, I live in the North
The poppy appeal always had a special place in my heart because my Grandad used to sell them and I used to tag along when I was a little kid
I've lived in a lot of cities and towns across the North and I've never seen this
Maybe it's a London/Southern thing
I have gone without before
Usually because I misplace them, repeatedly
Never had a comment
I do like it because it's more consitent with how we call other countries
We don't say the Slovak Republic for Slovakia or the French Republic for France for example even though those are both their official names
So I like it in that sense and I try to use it in writing where possible
In speech though I'm kind of hesitant to adopt it
It sounds a little weird and I don't think I've ever heard anyone else say it in real life
It's always 'Czech Republic'. So I'm kind of inclined to carry on doing the same so as not to appear odd haha
I want it to be called 'Czech-ch-czech-czech-czech-ch-czechitout'
Not my country, but I do like saying Czechia
Czechia, Czechia, Czechia
Perhaps over the next decade or so it might become more common in speech
It would be nice to have a normal short name for the country that people actually use I think anyway
I just don't want to be the one to lead the change haha
Not till I've heard someone else say it
Mine is the [flag of great britain] which was used before Ireland joined the UK
The flags and heraldry associated with the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy are some of the best flags we have
If there's ever regional devolution in England I hope they use those regions purely to have use for those flags
The flags of [Essex] [Kent] and [Northumberland] are my favourites
The [Mercian] flag is also worth a shout
Damn, Ireland gon’ make me act up
Jealousy and envy are pretty different, it's just that people are often ignorant to the differences hence why they're used interchangeably
Yeah unfortunately London is basically the UK capital for everything
How often do you hear mentions of the UK pottery scene
It's hardly the backbone of the British economy
Their football team stoke city’s nickname is the potters
If spoken it is referred to as Pfizer but in writing it tends to be called  Biontech-Pfizer or Pfizer-Biontech
Nine if I’m allowed to count Latin
Eight if not:
English

Latin
Gratias tibi ago
In northern england a simple "ta" will suffice
Pronounced "tah" or like a non rhotic "tar" but you have to drag out the A or you will show yourself as a foreigner
German, French, English, Italian, Spanish, Swedish/Norwegian, Croatian (with shit pronunciation), and somewhere I know Hungarian but its not coming to me right now
So 7/8
Including my own
English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French, Dutch, German
Well that's not even relevant to the entire thread
I get that you're a bigot who is constantly pushing your agenda, but at least put some effort into making sense
Not often something is going to as bad as it sounds
The massive building with the boat on top of it
Tiny country, massive city
England experiences more tornadoes per square kilometre than any other nation on Earth
We even have a fancy Guinness World Record’s [page] to prove it
I always thought it was kind of ridiculous how we claimed defeating the Spanish Armada as some kind of amazing victory, when a storm basically did all the work for us
we have lots of little’uns
It’s just a matter of statistics
We’re a small country that experiences lots of small, weak tornados that do little damage and often go unnoticed by the general public
Hence the stat
The US is huge and features much larger and more dangerous tornadoes, so you hear about these ones more
Kinda on topic but I think its crazy that Squash isnt in the olympics
Its a great sport and even though I dont play or ever watch it I just dont understand why its not an Olympic sport when incredibly niche sports like Syncronised swimming (that seems to only be done in Russia) is
Anyways, for Team GB to win I think it'd have to be another sport that involves sitting down (we're quite good a sitting down sports like Rowing or Cycling) so maybe a motorsport which again we're quite good at
For the Youth Olympics, hula-hooping
Every primary school has at least three million of the things, there must be a reason for it
Rounders
It’s like baseball, but slightly different so no-one will know how to play it
They started practicing beforehand, which ruins the fun
Lets combine all our countries and do the Bullrun but its a huge roll of Chèvre chasing us through the streets of Pamplona
We have what are called joke parties, like the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, the Al-Zebabist Nation of Oog, and the Liberal Democrats
Greece probably
If we do, it's not every train
Tbh, UK train etiquette is that you dont really speak unless spoken to, anyway
It's kind of an unwritten rule that you don't make much noise on trains, tubes and busses on England
Kind of a common courtesy, so we dont have things like quiet zones
huh, never knew that, lol
the more you know i guess
For me its Bristol
Good mix of pretty architecture and nice houses in some parts and more edgy and vibes in others
Also has a great food, art and music scene
In the UK either Liverpool (for friendliness) or Edinburgh (for architecture and history)
Yeah boi just moved to Swansea last week, some awesome natural beauty here and the city is pleasantly small
Manchester is interesting
Man, jag älskar Göteborg
My bro is a Swedish citizen, visited him every year since 2013 and if Scotland doesn't take me in after I graduate, Sweden will
Aye York is my favourite in England for sure, as is the whole northern countryside
What about st David's? It's a city with 1,600 residents
Been exploring them both in the last 2 weeks
The train back to Yorkshire is disgustingly expensive though
Don't know why
Yeah man my buddy in Texas told me that, and it's true, the whole of Europe is tops a 3 hour flight away
Pretty freakin awesome
For example, for NYE (hopefully) I'm flying to Oslo to meet my pal then we're driving down to Munich to meet up with some other guys we met in our travels
I love Europe
If that was a Doctor Who reference, I understood that reference
I occasionally pop in to expand my horizons a little, see what's going on outside my bubble etc
Probably my business studies trip to Cadbury World in Birmingham when I was 15
wasn't that great but it's the most memorable because
chocolate
We went to Cadburys World in Birmingham
All I remember is eating a ton of melted chocolate
I dont know why we went there I just remember going there in primary school
We did lots of caving at my school, such an odd activity for teenagers but there you go
I  remember absolutely loving it but honestly now I think I would be scared shitless
actually just thought of another one
possibly year 5 of primary school going to what I think was a replica of a Victorian school
so we sat and learnt in a classroom of that era
if anyone from england knows where that might of been (south) then let me know
c'mon if you speak a few words you basically speak the language
apparently
Jimmy Saville
Sex ed in school, started in year 5 all the way through schooling
That's what we had
England/Great Britain/the UK and Portugal have the world's oldest alliance, dating back to 1373
Barring the period in which Portugal was subject to the Spanish crown, the alliance has never been broken
Portuguese soldiers served in the trenches in WW1, and although they didn't take an active combat role in WW2, they allowed Allied ships and aircraft to use the Azores as a staging post/base, which helped no end in the Battle of the Atlantic
Now, of course, the bilateral alliance has been subsumed into NATO and, until recently the EU
Don't worry, Britain is now ruining itself
I feel very similar to you but with English in place of Spanish and half Irish
like the time we colonised country #47 changed that country's history a lot but for us
eh just add them to the "Commonwealth" and call it a day
England was already unified before that, the Norman invasion was how England was conquered, not created
Alternatively, Harold winning the Battle of Hastings would also have led to a very different future for us
1066 was such an important year
That’s like _old school_. I’ve only ever heard of that happening
Don’t think I’ve ever encountered it personally
Its still used even by the youth where i live but its shortened to "howdo"
Hahah
Im from Yorkshire
Edit: you are imagining it as a posh thing,when the opposite is true
There are some things in scots that if you werent used to and were said in a posh accent you would think they came from 1900 english aristocracy
Norfolk, just so happens that's where I live
birmingham
This is something I love about Switzerland, a few hours of walking can take you from a busy city to a remote mountainside with no noise except the wind and cow bells
Have to say I'm jealous of anyone who lives in places like that
Ik Switzerland isn't all perfect, but after living in a flat area of England for so long I really wish I could have somewhere like that to get away from the world for a bit
Siberia
The taiga
That’s why I love Yorkshire in England
Almost any town and city has walkable green space nearby
Sheffield and the Peak District most distinctly applying
But the Midlands has the second biggest city in the entire country
> I'd also nominate the bit between Northumberland and Cumbria
Almost completely empty countryside apart from a few weird towns (Hexham, Haltwhistle, Wooler, Jedburgh, Hawick)
It's actually very beautiful there
Drove to Wooler once and it was unreal
We definitely have some nice places, In the spirit of this thread our "middle of nowhere" places like the Yorkshire moors and Peak District are wonderful
I often walk around there and I love it
I just get bored of my local culture, and that's probably the same with most people in Europe and their culture
Honestly there is no better feeling for me than walking into a place where no-one is speaking my language
Being a lifelong Englishman I'm getting pretty bored of England
If bored then you’re boring
Longford
Fair enough
I would argue parts of the North like Cumbria or parts of the South like rural suffolk are more middle of nowhere
I come from a medium/small town in the Midlands that doesn't have a lot going on, but I can be in a town of 200k+ in 10/15 mins, a city of 1m+ in 45 mins and London in just over an hour, so even though my town is pretty dead I can be somewhere that isn't pretty sharpish
If you were in rural Cornwall or something that could never be the case
It would be a civil war between Manchester and Birmingham
Midlands pride worldwide
Imagine being from the top or bottom of the country
Could never be me
Both
Grow up in a smaller town and move to a big city for work
Leave big city to go raise kids in smaller town
Personally, I'm going to uni so moving from small-town -> big city
I'll probably move back after though
I believe some uni students will stay in their uni city after uni
Its such a shame that Rugby isnt more popular in Europe
Its a fantastic sport and I dont see why some countries only like 1 or 2 sports
Its perfectly possible to be a fan of multiple sports
Its pretty normal like multiple sports like Football, Rugby, Tennis, Cricket, Cycling, Athletics etc in the UK
Dont get me wrong, Football is by far the most popular sport here and some peoples lives fully revolve around their local club
Well the sport(both Union and League) was invented and codified here, so it was and very much still is extremely popular here, it's arguably the second most popular sport(admittedly it's a distant second after football in most parts of England, with the exception of the South West, which is Rugby Union country and with the exception of parts the North where Rugby League(another code of rugby, it has slightly different rules, and plays a bit differently, it's the faster game in general
It's absolutely huge in Australia) predominates
But yeah it's widely played, it's watched on TV, it's played in primary and high schools as part of PE and after school teams that play other school teams(it's the same for unis too), it's a big deal in England
It's a huge part of the sporting landscape
And never forget England are the only Northern Hemisphere team to win the world cup(back in 2003 in Australia, Vs Australia, and to this day
[this moment remains one of the most iconic, unforgettable moments in all of English sports and indeed all of rugby history] ), and we should've won it for a second time last year in Japan too, but England flopped in the final and South Africa were on top of their game
I digress, so yeah it's extremely popular, defo a big deal here
And has been for a long time
As someone that watches a lot of rugby - i can tell you that the only places it gets proper national coverage is the UK, Ireland and France
Italy obviously plays it, but that largely confined to the north of the country (Veneto, Lombardy) and also Rome
With the next tier of countries:
Its pretty popular in Georgia (again in parts of the country) and they are the easily the next best ‘european’ side which is pretty impressive given the size of the country
Some people have said its as popular there as football but I’m not so sure
Rugby used to be really popular in Romania but its sort of slumped since the fall of Ceaucescu
Ive a couple of Romanian friends from uni and neither really know much of the game
They’ve heard about it and know Romania play it but thats it
Next you’ve got a few countries which are reasonable at the game but its really really restricted to a couple of cities
Namely Spain (Valladolid plus the Basque Country), Portugal (Lisbon), Russia (Moscow and Krasnoyarsk)
After that its pretty small minority game - Germany has Heidelberg where its popular but thats an outlier - apart from ex-British outposts like Malta where the game is reasonably popular but they are too small to make an impact on the world stage
Rugby is very popular
We have rugby clubs where you can learn it and play with other people in your town and Secondary schools (11-16) have rugby in PE
Incredibly
Arguably one of the National sports
Rugby World Cup finalists last year
And yeah Georgia is probably the best 2nd tier European nation for rugby
I’m not a huge fan myself but it is indeed popular
How did rugby union get to Georgia and why did it become popular
, Also why is it, how come rugby has never captured Europe's attention and why is it not popular there
Its big in Heidelberg and thats it
You guys are firmly in the 3rd tier of european countries for rugby
Hockey has always been a strange one for me in NL
If you look at the competing teams its more of a commonwealth than rugby
More akin to cricket - yet you guys love it
Yes but also no
You guys have a national team but it is alongside Finland, Turkey and Bulgaria as the worst on the continent
Its great to see the game growing though
I think one year you featured in the Rugby Europe Championship (the tournament below the Six Nations) but you got immediately relegated
Whilst i agree with your sentiment - its worth noting that we only really play sports we invented
Things like handball and basketball are big on the continent but more or less non existent here
Ice hockey has a professional league here but is still largely unknown
Rugby League is also by far the most popular and widely played form of rugby in Australia iirc
League is huge Down Under
The NRL is by some significant margin the world's best Rugby League competition
Also here in the South West rugby union is arguably more popular than football, and in the West Country rugby is certainly not the reserve of former public schoolboys, it's much more like it is in Wales, where rugby is the sport of the common people
Its big in Valladolid
Arguably your two strongest clubs are both from there
I agree though, its almost impossible to watch rugby in spain apart from in English/Irish bars
Fair enough
I assume it’s Football then Ice Hockey normally in Czech Rep
I know once upon a time you were in the second tier of european rugby but i dont know how you fare as a nation now
Strange considering you guys were in the 2007 world cup
The game has definitely gone backwards a bit there
Is the 6 Nations broadcast in the Czech Republic
, Like have people heard of it
New Zealand have started up their competition again - i dont know if the Netherlands has tv deals for Super Rugby - if not you can watch that on RugbyPass
Ive been getting up early to watch it and its been really really good so far
Also: its the only sport ive seen which currently has full stadiums packed with fans as NZ is Covid free now
Come down the westcountry
Its arguably bigger than football in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset
Its reasonably popular in Catalonia and the Pais Vasco
Valladolid is also strangely big on rugby - your two biggest clubs (both semi pro) are from Valladolid
You Fins are all to busy rallying/ice hockeying/skiing etc to care for rugby
Yeah the sport seems a pretty big deal in Veneto and to a lesser degree Lombardy
With the exception of the two Rome clubs, your entire top division comes from those regions plus your two professional teams
I dont think the situation where the Italian national side has been pretty comprehensively beaten the last few years has helped
You’re still easily the 6th best side in Europe but the gap between you and the 5th (Scotland) has grown
Its a shame - you guys are very close to hitting the big leagues with sevens
Get them into the olympics and the country might open up
Its probably worth noting that you guys only got to that stage of the world cup qualifiers due to effective disqualification of spain and romania, but after the 6N, then Georgia, Romania, Spain, Russia and Portugal - you guys are among the next best (alongside the dutch and belgians)
As a smaller child, i know it knocked the love of the game out of some of my peers
I fought through it
We teach the game completely wrong here
In New Zealand, kids compete based on weight rather than age
It develops core skills rather than just ‘might is right’
Its probably accurate but you are among the better countries in Europe
Below the Six Nations, theres a tournament called the REC that you compete in
Its usually Georgia, Romania, Spain, Russia, Portugal and whoever has got promoted that year (and usually go straight back down)
What always surprises me is for a country so football crazy, your attendances are so much lower than England, Germany and Spains
At one point Serie A had a lower average than the Championship
Is there a reason for this
Is a cultural thing
Honestly i cant see it
I think we’re pretty much saturated as it is
In England alone we’ve got 5 professional football leagues (plus semi pro below it), 1 and a half professional Rugby Union leagues, a professional Rugby League division, fuck knows how many pro Cricket leagues in various formats and numerous other british sports
Plus a pro Ice Hockey league and some basketball (idk what level as its not really my flavour)
We’re only 50-60 million people and theres only so much sport we can take in without something else moving aside
Gridiron
It's not meant to have that space in there
I know it is very much a small sport in most of europe
A lot of countries have it in their capitals but hardly anywhere else
Particularly outside western europe
Eggs, no
Milk, of course, otherwise it would go off within a day
Sometimes it doesn't even last to the date which is deeply upsetting
I hope for everybody's sake that nobody is buying that horrible stuff
People definitely drink a glass of milk for its own sake here
I know loads
You're living in a milkless bubble my friend
I probably had at least a glass of milk a day growing up
It’s become more common in the last 10 years
But it probably depends on the restaurant here
However taking home a ‘doggy bag’ is generally acceptable, most restaurants have a polystyrene container available to put your left overs in
In the UK it would be seen as very odd, I think (though I suspect most restaurants would totally oblige if you wanted to, it's just culturally 'not done')
After doing it a lot in the USA though I think it's great and we should normalise it
I dont know if its fair to say its frowned upon here but its pretty unusual
Yeah, I get the impression it's a question of whether it's ordinary to do it in the country, rather than whether it's stigmatized
Even if people in some country usually eat small portions and don't need to take anything home, it doesn't mean they'd judge you if you did
That's also the point of the doggy bag though
Either way, endeavoring to eat everything at the restaurant or to bring it home and eat later, you are trying not to waste what you paid for
Most Indian and Chinese restaurants (which are very popular in the UK) have operated as both restaurants and takeaways since forever
And recently, even before covid, many other non-takeaway restaurants have started offering delivery service with Deliveroo, Ubereats and so on
Like one of the French posters said elsewhere, it was weird to ask for a doggy bag 5 years ago, but now in many places it would not be strange
They already have takeaway boxes available and are happy to sell meals to go, so they're fine with giving you a couple of boxes to put the leftovers in if you don't finish your meal
It is not *all* restaurants though
I would not expect this service in a high-end restaurant, and in most restaurant portions are manageable to eat in one sitting anyway
I remember when I went to house parties frequently that was the rule also, although that was mainly because we were all underage so buying alcohol in bulk was tricky
It's still a private place though
You can have net curtains
For what it's worth, outside of IB the hours are more normal
I work as a dev in an IB attached to a trading desk and none of the traders or middle office work that late, and I've never seen them in on saturdays
Richard III murdered a bunch of people
Yes he did, he won a plurality in not only one but two free and fair elections in 1932, before he was even in government
This is how governmental systems work under proportional representation: acquire a plurality and then you are normally placed as leader of a government albeit in a coalition
Hitler was indeed 'elected' fairly democratically to begin with: even if he was appointed by the President, this is how governments are formed
Hitler would have been elected democratically today under the same system
He did not just take over or intimidate/fraud elections until 1933
They were entirely fair up until that point
He acquired over the percentage of the vote that Tony Blair had in the UK in 2005 in the July one
Hitler progressed through the system via democracy
That is a terrifying thought
Rather than whitewashing it and pretending he just assumed power out of nowhere, we should learn from it and reflect that radical far-right extremists are never the solution to our problems
The people helped him on his way up the ladder
It's kind of similar to how Churchill is viewed
People admire him for his WW2 leadership and aren't so aware of the other not so good stuff he did
That’s so weird, here in England we refer to rickets as ‘bendy-wendy Sweden legs’
Lol come to England especially London there’s posh sleepy straight up weirdos
I'm from Yorkshire but my parents grew up int South (although my mums Scottish) so I have a weird Yorkshire with a slightly Southern twang in certain pronunciations (still say baff and casstle)
The amount of shit i got as a youth being called posh when I actually came from a low income family was ridiculous, and even now some simpletons up here will question it
Thing it goes both ways, nobody in the south or Scotland ever made a negative jibe about my mostly northern accent
I remember a farmer from Kerry going viral in Ireland a couple of years back because no one could understand him, now that's a sign of a strong regional accent
Surely there are business travellers all over the world who often need to eat alone
Even in mcdonalds
My mind is blown by that
Mcdonalds is a cheap lunch place
And Star Wars
Is pizzoccheri often served with potatoes, cabbage and fontina
If it's the pasta I'm thinking of then it's amazing
32, One them of being the entire city of Bath, I grew up in the neighboring city so I personally have never really given much notice to the world heritage thing, just always seemed kinda normal to have ancient things of importance around
Some of ours are pretty weird though, lots of industrial revolution things
Also The Lake District is listed as cultural rather than natural which is kinda weird but also makes sense to me as I view the Lakes as the place in the UK where I feel, I dunno, my most British
Despite the fact I have always lived several hundred miles south of there
Teacake vs Cob vs Barmcake vs Bara vs Bap vs Breadcake vs Softie vs Barm vs Muffin vs Bun vs Morning Roll vs Stotty vs Batch vs Oven Bottom vs Roll vs Scuffler
I can't see how onion would make it worse
Onion makes most things better
I'm team onion
It's pronounced Scone
The correct answers are scone rhyming with ‘bone’ and a bread roll is a ‘cob’.
Cone is pronounced like bone
I'd have to do a blind taste test to find out which one I really like but I assume it would be onion
I'm just a huge fan of onions
hate them
Why can't they drop the onion from cheese and onion crisps
We have the in the UK, United Kingdom, GB, Great Britain or respective country
I think of it as 'pole-land'. It's the land of the Poles
As an English guy I say are-l-land
So the TV show Little Britain would just be Wales
> in 1913
It was renamed that long ago
Wow
One of my lecturers at uni still uses Rumania/Rumanian
I thought it was pretty cool when I first heard him say it
I'm on board with that, I think you'll just have to convince those Northern Irish
Swap it for Cork
An end to democracy, sounds great
Essentially there's a (slight
) majority in Northern Ireland that want to remain being in the UK, which is why when Ireland became independent, Northern Ireland remained in the UK
The minority Republicans want to be reunited with the rest of Ireland
Not me, but my mum was really into Egyptian stuff when I was born, and I narrowly avoided being called something like Hapchetsut or Nefititi
We named my youngest half-brother after his maternal great grandfather Viktor
We anglicised it though, by using a C (I didn't actually catch onto that until he was about 3)
I don't know if it counts as 'foreignness' since technically they were once English, but I love Shakespearean names, especially for girls; 'Viola', 'Cymbeline', 'Lavinia', 'Valeria'. I feel like if I started trotting out little Cymbeline though, it'd raise some eyebrows
I'm not trying to be pretentious, I just think they're really pretty, but that is definitely how it would be perceived
I would name my child chiara or fabio depending on gender
Unfortunately I don’t have a drop of Italian in me
Awh, I quite like Joyfully-Joe
He (she
) sounds like a cheerful sort
I like Japanese names too
I really like a lot of the Russian versions of names for men, Mikail, Nikolai
They just sound nicer, but it would be weird if I randomly gave my kids Russian names
Can you imagine the shit I would have gotten at school
Yes
Nefertiti
My mum also liked Anuksunamen
She also wanted to call my brother Amenephis
Ukrainian, I believe
Oh well, either way it would be weird
Well, I don't even want kids, but if I did I would be seriously tempted
Yes, this was long before the Mummy films came out, so I'm sure she was an actual Egyptian princess
Explain that to me
How do you get Sasha from Aleksandr/Aleskandra
fuckin lol of course we do
that's why there's the stereotype of people from eastern europe wearing Adidas tracksuits
or young inner city English people wearing big North Face puffer jackets
or football fans in Britain wearing Stone Island coats to games
of all the "do Europeans (because of course Europe is a homogenous culture where every country is the exactly same) do this
" questions this one is probably the most bizarre
and we once got "do Europeans know what corn is
My view on Italy has dampened a little because me and my girlfriend received some racist abuse and was stared at a lot for being a mixed-race couple, particularly in Rome
Though we still loved our visit and have every intention to returning to Italy and visiting more of Italy as we only visited Milan, Crema and Rome
Thats a totally unfair view of France IMO
Even with the UK are super London centric so I understand why people might only come to London but France is so, so, so, so, so much more than Paris
&#x200B;
> I was on a bus when I learned about the outcome of the vote and I started sobbing like a fool
Still blows my mind how personally a lot of continentals took the vote
I don't say this to diminish your feelings, but if I lived in Italy and you voted to leave the EU I don't think I would have been personally offended
It really highlights how differently we saw the EU compared to continental Europe
I find it odd that as a Greek person it wasnt until 2016 you became weary of Turkey
So you transitioned from believing one extreme stereotype to another
Sound like a very balanced, rational person
It's pretty interesting to see eu citizens to be so personally attacked to us leaving
I separate the eu from countries and see them for their food, music, language and culture
Ive traveled to spain countless times and love your country to bits
However If we were still in the eu and let's say spain were too leave and I say this kindly, I wouldnt care
> In the process betraying their brothers for about 73 years and losing a lot of things that made them Great in the first place
What do you mean by this
Who were our brothers for 73 years
Austria pros:
- Beautiful landscape
- Skiing
- History
- Beer
Austria cons:
- Not so friendly
- Speaking German will *not* help you
Not a big deal in the grand scheme, we had positive experiences as well, just a little jarring as we hadn't even stayed 2 nights
All our other expectations were more than met and we have every intention to visit Sicily, Naples, Florence and wherever else in Italy
Yeah it's her favourite movie
IMO as France still has so much going on outside of Paris like huge tourist resorts in the Alps and the South as well as various parts of the wine country it is less capital centric as the UK
Getting tourists to see something in the UK that isn't in London is like blood from a stone
Many people think London is actually a country
I fully empathise with how that would of felt for you and I feel sad and ashamed that my country made you to feel so rejected
However, I believe that if I was obsessed with Italian culture, spoke the language, lived and made a life for myself and then Italy ran an campaign to leave the EU based on an anti European sentiment, I wouldn't be personally hurt
Simply because I as a British person don't really identify as a European so it wouldn't feel like an attack on me
That's all I'm trying to highlight
I don't think a lot of British people realised how strong the European feeling is in a lot of continentals
I'm from the UK and I dislike having English as the current dominate language
Ive three questions
To any a non-native English speakers reading:
* What did the English language sound like to you before you learned English
* Also what did the various English accents(English/Welsh/Irish/Scottish/American/Canadian/Australian/New Zealand) etc sound like to you before you learned English
, Could you differentiate them
* And lastly does English sound like a Germanic language to your ears
I know this sounds kind of strange but as an English person I do, because in america, they treat the language as if it is theirs (like many other things)
I know its a petty reason but it annoys me
I've always found it useful to have a lingua franca, I can speak to most people online (and off tbh) with my native language
In 2019 and 2020 I went to Azerbaijan, France, Czechia, and Greece, and in all  four English was enough to get by
We realise how privileged we are
Everyone in England laughs about "fuck me everyone Europe is so impressive with languages, good job we don't have to be I think we'd struggle".....
I have a friend who is half English and half German and grew up in the UK, apparently whenever he meets Germans they ask to speak German with him because he says his father taught him fluently
His father is Swabian
apparently you can speak German with a really think Swabian and English accent at the same time
I've never seen an English person annoyed someone not English doesn't speak English
I feel this is an intra European pressure
When you say it sounds quite nice, can you elaborate on why that is
, Also as a Pole what did English sound like to your ears before to understood it
, and lastly does English sound like a Germanic language to your ears or not and why is that
wtf is this post
Not neighbouring country (neighbouring island) but I really do fear a sealand invasion
We’re an economic threat to ourselves, does that count
Our neighbours have been trying to help us massively the last couple of years or so by telling us how much better off we’re in the EU, but unfortunately 52% of our people are too bigoted and dumb to listen
Scotland: No, we hate each other in sports but we are brothers
Wales: No, too unpopulated, but they’re nice as well
Ireland: Historically, due to *certain* politicians and Prime Ministers in our country, now made the Irish hate us
France: What would we do without you
Isle of Man: Errrrrr yeah just, do what you’re doing
Those pesky Corns
Tractors and Ice Hockey for everyone in Ukraine then
It's not coming home anytime soon
Oooooh hot take from a scot
thanks man : )
Which ones
Erm I'm a native English-speaker and *I wish* I could follow Dutch just by virtue of already knowing English
Dutch and English aren't mutually intelligible
You must have some very smart friends
I watched an interview with Graham Norton recently in which he talked about being raised Protestant, and because of that literally didn't feel Irish
"We're"
Please don't talk for all of us
Ermm
I don't think that example serves your point very well dude
Anti-muslim bigotry is not to be accepted
>well, ok
Why not
It’s their feeling
\^\^\^ that is not the appropriate response to someone saying they're not comfortable around muslims
Omg
very different mate
And if you can’t see the difference I don’t see much point with continuing this conversation
And where did that land him
An early grave in my home county of Yorkshire
It'll be a cold day in Hell before I recognize the Holy Roman Empire
London’s been done but London/England under the romans vs the celts could be fun
Could do either side but considering Ubisoft is French they’d defo be the celts lol
Not sure about accidentally, but it has become a Christmas tradition
It'll always be on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day or Boxing Day (Christmas Eve this year) and I always watch it

The height of rock music in the 70s and 80s? Do you mean the 60s and 70s?
Rock music was popular in the 80s but various other genres had certainly broken through
When someone says '80s music' new wave is usually the first thing that comes to mind
wow,  fair few of them had breakthroughs here too
'Sylvia' is on my driving playlist, along with 'Twilight zone' & 'Radar love' :)
Unless you’re counting Scots
fuck all
German, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, etc
are all completely unintelligible to English speakers
I can’t speak German, however when it is written down there are some parts that I can work out because of how closely related it is to English
Hmm, Dutch is quite similar, not spoken but written
Some German and Norwegian is as well
Scots is very similar and its fairly easy to understand
Frisian is a bit similar as well, so is Afrikaans
Swedish and Danish i have little clue about it
Hanged, drawn and quartered

Yeah - the 2010s reforms brought that up on the agenda highly
It's in place now
In the UK there are a a lot of people that want Scottish independence and people that want Northern Ireland to join the Republic of Ireland
Wales and Cornwall have very small movements for independence too
Yes
There is an independence movement for Scotland, which has a reasonable chance for succeeding
They would probably join the EU
The Welsh independence movement is small, but has grown as the main political party advocating Welsh _interests_ or Welsh _autonomy_ has moved more clearly to Welsh independence under new leadership
Although everyone knows there is calls to join Ireland, there are also a small section of Northern Irish that want NI to be independent in its own right
Finally, there are small movements in Cornwall, and Yorkshire
Interestingly, noone from Crown Dependencies or Overseas Territories want to be independent, although the Chagossians, who were expelled by the British from their native land to form an American base, have been making a campaign with little success
There really isn’t any movement in Cornwall for independence
Yorkshire is more likely to declare independence than them
Just did a quick google and there was a petition of 180,000 signatures, which is fairly small given that 9,000,000 live in London but then again there could be millions who didn’t sign to petition but would of done
52,000 people in the county put Cornish-only as their ethnicity on the last census, and they had a petition of 50,000 signatures to get a devolved Cornish Assembly (One similar to that of the Welsh Assembly or Northern Irish Assembly)
They want autonomy more than independence, but to say Yorkshire is more likely to declare independence is just wrong
It used to have its own language and Cornish people are a recognised national minority group, and are Celtic like Wales for example
Did they
I thought the last one was in 2014
If Northern Ireland did vote to join, would Ireland make any compromises to keep the local Protestant/Loyalist community happy
Things such as making Ulster-Scots a co-official language with English and Irish, joining the common-wealth, letting the North keep a devolved parliament, etc
I never knew Corbyn mentioned the Crown Dependencies
What did he say
Love to know the real life % of those that signed that that actually live in London and weren't simply foaming mouthed lunatic level remainers
Sounds like the SNP
Would have***
Sorry lol
The government said that the last referendum would be a once in a generation vote
Boris Johnson reaffirmed this when the Scottish first minister requested another referendum which the UK government rejected in January
It could be a while till we see another one
This isn't how it's going to work
If the UK still exists then you need to reverse the GFA, Stormont, self-determination, everything else you could possibly think of remains
Unification is not the act of ticking a box to make the British, Irish
It's the act of gaining some control
Otherwise why would we not be allowed to enact your proposals for ourselves
I hardly speak any spanish but I know that morning and tomorrow are both mañana, meaning tomorrow morning is "mañana por la mañana"
For us, Tea can mean both the drink and dinner
Unless that is just my family that does that
In Chinese the character for both 'moon' and 'month' is the same
And to lie down doesn’t mean you lie, but hey ho that’s languages for you
Something similar exists in English as well, using learn to mean teach, but it's very non-standard and quite stigmatised
In Middle English we had *lernen* 'to learn' and *leren* 'to teach' but at some point *leren* was influenced by *lernen* and adopted the same form, just like I imagine happened in Dutch
To any Dutch and Scandinavians reading ive two questions to ask you
* As a non-native speaker what did the English language(and the English accent) sound like to you before you learned English
* Does English sound like a Germanic language to your ears
, And do you hear any similarities between English and your own Germanic languages
When asked by a Brit I'll say Cornwall (province), when asked by a non brit its usually just "England".
Id say overall i identify with my country, but in many ways i couldnt be more different from a Londoner, me being from the countryside
I could have more in common with a Frenchman from the countryside than an english Londoner
Country
I'm from the middle of the Midlands
Doesn't really have a strong regional identity
Well, I’m originally from the East Midlands of England but though I’m happy to be from there, it’s not my home
I moved to London about 8 years ago and I much prefer it to the Midlands
I do feel like a Londoner, even if I’m not a native Londoner
But with regards to the question, I don’t really feel more strongly about being a Londoner than I do about being English or British, or vice versa
I’m a Londoner, Englishman, Briton, and a European
None of these identities are in conflict
there’s just at different levels of specificity
I identify most with my region, the West Country (South West England)
London, the North and other areas at times can be quite alien to me
To anyone not British I’d say i’m English as most don’t know the SW anyway
I identify as being British and European too but those would be last
Region > England > UK> Europe . I live in an area with a moderate regional identity so would say that if asked by a fellow British person, but to a non-British person I would just say I am English
I have been known to say 'near London' in the past but that is far from true
Geordie first, Northerner second, English third, British last
I'm proudly English, and then British
Thats interesting, that how in antiquity Greece was all about city states and it was all city pride, famously so

We used to go for walks and bike rides around the peat moors
I read a lot and did lots of drawing
I subscribed to a pony magasine where i got a toy pony each month and i used to make stables out of cardboard
I also swam competitively from a young age which took up a lot of my time as I got older
riding my bike, video games, board games, tv, drawing cartoons, toys and whatever fad was in at the time (yoyos, tamagotchis) riding my scooter, indoor softplay places, nature/animals
For some reason I've always struggled with 'bald' always comes out as 'bold' much to the amusement of my friends
I live in italy and even my very talented partner can't tell the difference between 'butter, better, batter'
Or as a lot of spanish speakers do, overcompensate for it by pronouncing it as they do a "j" with that sort of throaty "ch".
"Chhhello
Chhhow are you
Can confirm, scoiattolo in Italian challenged me for years
Pronounce flour exactly the same as flower
I though it's pronounced as it's spelt - 'he-ge-mo-ny'?
Is there any evidence that this is even true
This thread is full of anecdotes and stereotypes
I doubt there any difference, it's probably just in your head because you've been told that the UK is dangerous
Is there actually any statistical evidence that drunken fights are more likely in the UK than Germany
I went out most weekends in my late teens, there was often a police riot van sat on the road, though I never actually saw it in use
I saw the odd fight but it largely involved people who were looking for fights
Very easy to avoid
Never felt unsafe
For context this is based on a few towns in the South West of England and I’m female
I agree with the comment that some people go out to get drunk, but I highly doubt the UK is alone here and it’s by no way a reflection on what most people do, perhaps more common with groups of young lads
I’ve never been on a nightout in Germany so no idea how different it is really
Exactly
You’d never get a question like this asked about another country on this sub
It’s so obviously biased
it’s total bullshit, you’d never get posts like this made about another european country in this sub
It’s soooo blatant
Yeah but UK bad
Edit: Also I don't really know where this stereotype comes from
Maybe people generalising an entire country because of some Brit lads in Ibiza
I've lived all over the UK and have never seen a fight in a pub, nor much by the way of an uncontrolled drinking culture
Even in some pretty rough around the edges pubs in North/East London, worst I've had was a dodgy stare when I accidentally knocked into someone leaving the toilets
You're just describing the stereotypes, I'd be curious to see if there is any evidence to support them
But I doubt there is
> The only countries* feeling similar are our neighbours
Out of curiosity, which countries
[Dungeness] perhaps
Apparently it's one of the largest expanses of shingle in Europe
It's ecologically quite important too, I think particularly for some rare insects if I remember correctly
[Brimham Rocks] a relatively unknown spot near Harrogate, North Yorkshire
Sort of on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales
And we can see you
Growing up just the other side of the Channel in Kent whenever we went to the sea we would always look across to see if we could see France

My favourite for England has always been the hamlet in Dorset known as Shitterton
No need
Absolutely no need
What a great name
There's [Shitterton] For obvious reasons haha
Not quite so funny but there's a also hamlet near the town of Sandwich which is named Ham, leading to [a mildy amusing sign that reads 'ham sandwich']

Remember in the floods that happened in Cumbria a couple years back and the BBC presenter mumbled when he said Cockermouth so it came out at cummuf or something
There's a village near me called Fingringhoe
I can't tell if you're just making these up, but Australia is a strange place
There's also a Crapstone in Devon
Also, scroll down [this page] and look at just how much cock we have in the UK
A veritable abundance of cock, a plethora if you will
My favourites are Cockermouth, Cock Bank, Cockfield (two places), Cocklake and simply Cocks
There are also a few roads named Cock Alley or Cock Street
I can never read Århus without singing, [*Århus, in the middle of år street
Mmm cock
Yeah like Bournemouth and Plymouth and that
For sheer "single error by one or two people with horrible consequences", I'd submit the [Quintinshill rail disaster] of 1915

>In February 2016 the County Court in Nový Jičín sentenced the driver to 8 1/2 years in prison, and banned him from driving on Czech territory until 2026
What were the mitigating circumstances which meant he didn't receive the full tens years, and why wasn't he banned permanently from driving in Czechia
I've heard Hindenburg described as one of those men who kept on living well beyond his time, then managed to die at the absolute worst moment
It depends on who I'm talking to, I'm an atheist, but I'm not going to force my lack of belief on an upset grieving person
Well, I think it's more considerate to just say whatever religious stuff the grieving person wants to hear, rather than remaining awkwardly silent whenever god/religion is brought bought up
Well you can't 100% disprove the existence  of vampires, but if someone asked if you believed in them you'd probably just say no
I acknowledge that I can't prove the non existence of god, but I say I'm an atheist because I just feel like there isnt a god, and I don't feel the need to sit on the fence
If i'm wrong, I'm wrong
English guy here with a polish surname and I don’t think anyone has said it perfectly first try before
I always have to do the thing where I spell it out letter by letter to the check-in people
Had an American tour-guide ask me and my Northern Irish boyfriend if we liked our new prime minister, Boris Johnson
We do not
Username doesn't check out
Not in London
Eerie
Still none yet :(
I'm begining to think we're just not getting any at all, which would be a bit disappointing
With any luck maybe we'll get a little a bit later on, towards the end of February / start of March
We do tend to get snow a bit later on in winter here but still, to think it's nearing the end of January and we haven't had even a light 15-minute episode of snow is a bit of a shame
English Midlands and not yet, however February is usually our snowiest month so here's to hoping
No but it never really snows in East Anglia due to being in the rain shadow
Nope none where I am, its been bitterly cold but not snowy
Snowed a little bit in South Yorkshire your but only for a day, wasnt alot of snow either more like frost
I wouldn't say it's massive but it's a thing & trusted
During the night time/midnight they have teleshopping on some of the main tv channels

Most recently our current prime minister was born in New York
We've also had several foreign-born monarchs over the years but the most recent one was quite a while ago with George II who was from Germany
Bonar Law was born in Canada
Here's a few I can remember off the top of my head
Geography - Libya's flag is entirely green
They changed it 8 years ago to red, black and green horizontal tricolour with the Ottoman Star and Crescent
Corrected her at the end of the quiz but she doubled down
Geography - We had a textbook that didn't have the Mediterranean on a diagram about ocean currents
Wasn't the teacher but still that's ridiculous
She just told me it was likely because the Mediterranean isn't relevant for that map but it's still confusing af
Biology - Fungi are non-flowering plants
Asked her afterwards and again she doubled down
Researched it at home and tried to tell her but she ignored me
In fairness, I was an annoying /r/iamverysmart type 12 year old
I've also seen numerous maps missing South Sudan, but in fairness it's only been a nation since 2011
Usually its been on worksheets so I just add it on by hand
The worst map I've seen in a school was from my younger brother's, when I went to pick him up
Its worth noting that because my stepmum is head of languages at this PRIVATE School he gets a massive discount
The map still included Serbia and Montenegro as one state
They've been seperate for 13 years
Bloody hell, that's basic
Bruh, tell that to the Tasmanians
Though good luck with that
We "saved" them pretty hard after all
Surely the Ancient Greek word for wisdom is Sophia
As a mute, I can confirm that I do not have thoughts
You could argue that any county started WW1
Perhaps it was Russia's fault for getting involved in an otherwise one-on-one
Was it Germany's fault for bringing the rest of Europe into it, making it a world war
Was it Belgium's fault for not letting Germany through, making the war far more bloody and long-lasting
I mean, it's not correct, but you COULD argue it
Actually no, I don't think
Am saving this comment for when Covid-20 arrives and I know who to blame
Yeah, every time there's a bit of snow, the media act like it's a Snowpocalypse
Charlie Brooker on Snowpocalypse:
And don't forget
"Norway/Canada/Russia/Switzerland cope, and they get *much* more snow than us
Why is Britain so crap
>Surely snow has happened in the past
Yes, but its only majorly disruptive for maybe one or two days every few years
It's not really worth us having fleets of snowploughs and gritting depots on standby just for the occasional freak occurrences when it snows heavily
That being said, the media coverage is ridiculous
I disagree with you op, i think it would be;

I've never heard this one before
Slovakia is considered quite a safe country with quiet people in the UK
Certainly not somewhere Brits consider dangerous in any way, like for example Turkey, where there is an actual chance you may get stabbed for causing a ruckus, or Spain where the police are always looking for a chance to give you a shoe in
Couldn't see any articles on Google of British tourists being badly beaten or stabbed in Slovakia
Where are these tough guys
I'd argue that you shouldn't do this in any country
We have bike paths with bike pictures here, but it isn't a full system like you have, so we don't have to worry about bike traffic here
When I visited Denmark, I mostly remembered to stay out of the bike lane, but sometimes I forgot
Omg yes, I was so unimpressed haha
Go to the design museum instead
Fucking ace
I think taking a shit just off the highway is frowned upon is a lot of countries
You’re telling me it would be more acceptable to pop a chub than wear a towel in a sauna
>Slovakia is pretty safe country in general
That was not my point
But fighting sports are quite popular over here, many people do boxing, muay thai, mma etc
as a hobby
It's the same in the UK mate
We have a ton of world champion boxers
probably third or fourth behind USA, Russia and Mexico
UFC Champions and top 10s also
Fair play on the weapons point though
It's a good point
That's fair
Yes, luckily I managed to avoid being trampled

IKEA was not a luxury my family and probably many others in England like me go out to get a shoe rack and then end up lounging about in he rooms and buying everything from he bargain section
What are you talking about
IKEA is anything but luxury
It's where you shop when you're a student or want something basic
IKEA is probably the cheapest furniture store in the UK
How on earth could it be luxury
Actually pretty concerned there's now other Europeans thinking that we consider IKEA luxury and our houses are shitly decorated
Heals is luxury
Also it's known for being hard to leave
Its different for everyone
It's too serious whenever the person taking it stops laughing
Are you saying gays shouldn’t bother trying to ask people not to use the word ‘gay’ as an insult

Desserts, I'd love to be proven wrong but the variety of sweets, pastries, puddings etc is unmatched in my opinion
The Indian subcontinent also has an obscenely large variation of deserts to be fair
Thr council pop in the north of england and Scotland is also bloody delicious
If i went to someones house and they were drinking bottled water, it would seem completely foreign to me
I haven't had the pleasure unfortunately, are they distinct or do they follow a French tradition
Luckily my sister in law is a pastry chef here in italy, so unlimited incredible desserts are the order of the day
I didn't realize, my experience of Indian desserts derives mostly from Indian restaurants in the uk and they leave a lot to be desired
We can handle spices more than any country in Europe bar maybe Hungary
Guaranteed
Do you remember what the book was called
Sounds interesting
To be honest calling them fries really isn't right
To a British person fries and chip shop chips are something different entirely, so they have different standards
Eh, they do but they're always shit 'pubs' which do terrible versions of fish and chips
I think simply because as much as we have loads of access to the ocean, we have also always had loads of pastureland so good meat was never a problem
I'm all for good natured ribbing, but there is really no truth to this
We have adopted Indian food as our national cuisine
Look at the popularity of nandos
I would bet all my savings that your average Englishman has a greater tolerance to spice than say an Italian or Frenchman
You can say traditional British food isn't spiced, but really what European cuisines are, besides Hungarian
Italian uses minimal spices, French uses minimal spices, Spanish pushes the boat out with paprika but even then not loads
And when it comes to it, traditional British food does make use of spices like cinnamon, mace, mustard, ginger etc
Just straight up talking out your arse
Firstly I don't know what a 'third world' spice is
And if you find them overpowering that just means you come from a food culture that doesn't use a lot of spice so you're not used to it
There's nothing wrong with that, in fact I like Mediterranean food but compared to other cuisines it tends to be about light use of herbs and spices and letting the flavour speak for itself
Though I don't know what health has to do with that
Oh sorry I misunderstood your comment
> like the Turkish, you use peppermint as a spice
Do we
When
Thats and american making a mint sauce which is a herb, not a spice
Mint sauce is used for things like lamb which you would have with roast potatoes
Its on par with things like mayonese
Also its a herb closer to spearmint than peppermint which is a different flavour
Peppermint taste like menthol and we dont commonly  use it in our cooking
Im sorry, did you not read the rest of my post
Its a *herb* sauce
Not a spice
We dont use mint as a spice
Do you understand the difference between a herb and a spcie
Or does that not directly translate into german
Also in the UK mint and peppermint are two different things, when you buy 'mint' from the supermarket you get a differnet product to peppermint
I think perhaps come to the UK and see if you can find peppermint in anything but toothpaste
Yep, there's a chain called Mleczko here
I live in an area with a lot of Poles
It isn't rare to see "Polski Sklep"s here either
Although there are a lot of different groups of immigrants in general, it is also quite common to see shops with all sorts of flags including Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, etc
English——
Easy to get polish groceries in even the smallest towns in  England
Lots of poles have opened shops here
I’m in the  ex-industrial heartland of the north and the steel/coal has switched a small percentage of employees over to factory and warehouse work
Rightly or wrongly the central and e.europeans have gobbled up a lot of these jobs and their shops have followed them across the sea
I use some of their shops quite regularly, some are brilliant but asking what is in a product and what it tastes like etc is often like trying to get blood from a stone
Which rightly or wrongly discouraged integration
Even some Asian former shops have been bought out by a the central and e.europeans
Tons in London
From a town in England called Boston, I was there a few weeks back and I wouldn’t be surprised if there was more than 40 now, cabanossi and tymbark are some things I love from them that I know the name of anyway
Pretty much
In this day and age even small towns have then
My town of about 25k has at least 3 I can think of off the top of my head
Not really Europe, but I am in love with Chinese history
They pioneered so many things before Europe, for example whilst Western Europe was in the age of the shield wall, China was using rocket artillery, shotgun spear hybrids and even primative flamethrowers
Likewise they also pinoeered many aspects of a eraly modern society before the collapse of Rome
For example widespread literacy, centralised industry and a feudal nobility were all used in China before 500 AD
It bugs me that we don't learn more about Chinese history in the west
Its all well and good knowing about Henry VIII's many wives, but we don't get one word of the 20 million casualties of the Taiping heavenly rebellion
Likewise we know all about D-day and Pearl Harbour but I've not heard anything about the >15 million deaths of the Second Sino Japanese war that happened simultaneously
This is what makes Chinese history so interesting for me, the Chinese dynasties and their surrounding cultures have made a huge impact on the western world and achievied so much before us, yet we don't learn about it much here

Among others, I learn them due to connection to UK (e.g. Amhran na bhfiann in Ireland), Hockey (So Swedish/Finnish/Russian) and some random ones I've learned (although they're foreign ones like US/Canada/Australia)
I can recognise obviously the UK’s and England’s (like the one they use at the Commonwealth Games etc) other European ones I can recognise are probably France, Germany, Russia, Ireland and Italy
I know half of the first verse of my own
That’s it
I wouldn’t know the words but as well as my own i would know the following when I heard them - The US, France, Russia, Italy, Finland, Japan, Spain, Argentina, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia
Basically countries that either regularly feature on F1 podiums or we play them at Rugby (thus i also know Flower of Scotland/Irelands Call/The welsh one - despite not being official anthems)
The US/Russia I know because of their media coverage being major world powers
I suppose my knowledge of them comes from the 6 nations (Ireland, Wales, Scotland, France, Italy)
I dont think I could hum any other anthems but I'd probably recognize the German one
Christ, when did we last hear the Italian anthem on a podium
Fisichella in 2006
I remember it used to with Alonso at Renault
Used to kind of annoy me a bit as the cars were built in England as are Red Bull and Mercedes
Eventually got over that though
Out of interest how much is Frisian used in Friesland
Is it in the education system like Welsh is in Wales
Jerusalem is epic
Im now wondering if that bit isnt aired as often over here or if i just zone out
Ah i see, does this mean the language is on the wane
Not being spoken in the cities/towns, not really having to use it at school etc
I support it being voluntary but I know its harmful for smaller languages
Coronation Street:  10,302 episodes, been on TV for 60 years

I always love the old [Strabane Man] clip
The question is are there any accents from *your* country that are hard for people to understand
Yeah, but they wouldn’t have a French accent then would they
There's islands next to Africa which are technically part of france
No one wants that
Neither was I..
Depends on what kind of job you have

Minus the racism of course
In Britain we don't use the British Billion for some reason
I guess at some point around WW2 the use of the world Billion as in 1,000,000,000 became more widely used as businesses and even people started to actually have that much money so having a word other than Million Million was actually useful
Back in the 1700's I can't imagine anyone but scientists having to think about numbers that large
Jesus - try that in a british uni and the whole student body would be on strike
Been an atheist for decades, but even after all that time it still doesn't show on the outside
More seriously I have had mates for years and years and have absolutely no idea what they think of religion
It is usually the norm to be atheist
The progression of modern science has drawn a lot of people away from the bible and more towards the atheist side of things
I believe within this century, the UK will become a predominately atheist country
I rarely meet people my age (under 20) who say they are religious
I mean as a 17 year old I've found that with people my age it's kind of the default to be atheist
I think there's a certain subgroup of 13 year old atheists that don't know much about the world and spend too long on Reddit so think all religious people are like the extremists on the Bible belt in America
I mean they kind of absorb the rhetoric that atheists are oppressed because in parts of America they are and Reddit is dominated by Americans
Atheists have it pretty good in the UK because most people don't really care

For the record though, I pronounce it BudapeSt
I think it’s probably “correct” to pronounce it BudapeSHt though
I always forget how far South the Canaries are due to their popularity

My former soviet (South Ossetian) stepmother has never really brought it up
HOWEVER, back in 2018 we went to visit an old family friend in Poland (Rscezow - I think that's spelt right)
As we drove past one such monument in the city centre he told us how the locals have taken to calling it "Pussy" because it looks vaguely like a vagina
When I was there earlier this year, a lot of them saw themselves as Russian, it's a split, the boomers look bad to the USSR more, the younger population look to modern Russia
They've even started flying a fake Russian flag (literally the same as the current Russian flag but a bit longer shape) on their 'state buildings' next to the Transnistrian flag (which is a flag of Soviet Moldova)
The Lenin statues and communist era shit is everywhere there, but their President wants to start getting rid of it and try to get tourism focussed around imperial Russia and a shitty imperial Russian fortress at the city of Bender (which won't work, you can just go to Russia to see Russian imperial history)
It's different with the ethnic moldovan population in the PMR, but they are a minority there
I mean they won't actually join Russia, because Russia doesn't want the liability, and they have better than normal relations with Moldova atm because Moldova has a pro Russian president, but still, I would say Transnistrians see themselves more as Russians than their own nationality
No queuing and if the barman serves you before somebody you knew was there before you then you should tell the barman
The first point is fair, however it drives me mad when bartenders pay absolutely no attention to who steps up to the bar first
You have two fucking jobs: serve the drinks and pay attention to who comes first
Nothing more frustrating than standing at a bar for ages and then the dimwitted barman serves some prick at the other end of the bar who stepped up twenty seconds earlier
Said prick is always fully aware of what he has done as well but doesn't care
What if I've been in there plenty of times (they know what I drink on sight), I've spent plenty of cash there in the past, but I'm having a break from the booze, so I order a lime and soda and a bag of scratchings
A large pub near me with lots of big screens for the football deals with this problem by making you purchase a voucher at the door that you exchange for drinks at the bar
That seems so weird
When football is on in pubs here everyone is getting super wasted
It would get expensive quickly, knowing me
No they wouldn't lol

I live in a small town in england and n the roads the cycling infrasture is terrible
However being an ex mining town and ex industrial region, there is an abundance of old disused railway lines that have been converted into walking/cycling/bridleway trails  you can get across the entire country on them in the north of England
I think nearly 500 miles in total
I'm very lucky, I have used them my entire life for various reasons and now I use them to get to work
I ride for
2 minutes on a country road then the trail takes me directly to work  as in the fence of my work is on one side of the trail
As a kid I used them to visit friends, bike rides and they went directly between my mums and dads houses
Pretty shit
They're loads of moves to improve it but there are far to many thick as shit people here who dont understand how better cycling infrastructure improves all our lives
Haha I was at Edinburgh fringe last year and in the big park the cycle lane was stuffed with people
We saw a cyclist flying through it screaming
IT'S A BIKE LANE
IT'S A BIKE LANE
Had me and my mates in stitches
Sheffield is fucking shite too
Ridiculously hilly and convoluted roads with cycle lanes that vanish suddenly
Living in Swansea atm and it does seem better, particularly the dedicated cycle lane across the sea front and major A road out of town
There is absolutely nothing wrong with the English language

Some of the most commonly used words in the English language that we use every single day come directly from Old Norse brought over from Norway, Denmark with the Viking invasions/conquest/settlement from 800s-1000s etc

The stereotype is that it’s poverty-ridden
Northern Spain (and northern Portugal as well) is so different from what we traditionally associate with Spain
I remember a road trip I did from Madrid coming from Burgos into Asturias thought I’d accidentally entered Wales, it’s so green and Misty
People as well I think are slightly more reserved - that’s not to say less friendly though and the landscape is absolutely stunning

Picture:  [
I'm from Nottingham and I can't really pick a single landmark but the standouts would be:
- [Nottingham Castle] there's not much remaining of the original fortifications which were built in 1068 as there's been a fair amount of battles in the area but there's a 1600 mansion that has been built within the former structure
- [Wollaton Hall] a 1580 Elizabethan country house that was key in driving architectural trends, deer roam the surrounding parkland despite the whole ground being surrounded by the city which is quite quaint
- [Nottingham Council House] completed in 1929 which is quite recent compared to others but it forms as the main centerpiece of the city in the middle of Old Market Square
I’m from Bristol, where we have the Clifton Suspension Bridge, which was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel
Coventry  has 2 old churches, some old city walls from the Civil War , and a old cathedral ruins
Huh
I wonder if that's where the word "Mattock" comes from
Is this where we get the english word mallet
So, same PIE root potentially

As a midlander, this is all too expected
Midlands erasure is real
u/All-Shall-Kneel didn’t. And, with respect, most of you wants to leave the UK anyways (which is totally your call
Frankly I’m jealous)
Plus they could just be talking about their country specifically
Like you could answer what Scotland would be like if northern Scots swapped with Southern Scots
Then where I’m from - Nottingham, in the East Midlands - would likely be north-aligned
But no Northerner accepts Nottingham as northern
Not that I’d want to be
Midlander 4 lyf yo
odd that they’d remember england, wales and northern ireland but not scotland
Fair enough
A lot can change in 6 years
Its generally frowned upon unless you're on a nature trail or its past 10 and everyones hamerred
You will get fined £90 if the police catch you though
>  Europe because of its proximity to Italy
odd, pasta is popular because its good grub, not proximity, after all Indian/Pakistani cuisine is probably the most popular in the UK and its origin is far away
Fucking Americans man
>On the other hand, Erasmus students tend to be a bunch with a whole lot of people not being the sharpest knives in the drawer
Also, lots of people who never lived away from home and only lived in student lodgings where your food is cooked for you (which is also amusing and bothering to me
I find it depends, the problem is the attitude of students in different countries can be very different
In the UK, at my university, they tend to work harder than we do imho
English students have a stinking attitude if we go on Erasmus, because the marks often do not count towards our degree classification, and generally speaking English students (especially those from non top universities, speaking as someone who goes to a middle ranked uni) tend to have a very relaxed approach as it is
I like eating actual food at least half the time, so I try and cook properly, made a Pasta All'amatricana last night following a recipe from an Italian chef which was good, the problem is when it comes to European food, or even Italian food, English parents don't make it properly themselves, so the students are even worse
My mum buys the cheapest £0
20p for 500g Pasta because 'all pasta is the same', and then puts a load of sauce and cheddar cheese on it, I only eat her British food tbh
Luckily she is vegetarian, so I don't 'experience' the infamous British 'Carbonara' with double cream and bacon (it's just wrong, trust me)
My high school used to serve massively overcooked- pasta with baked beans as a sauce and cheddar cheese on top
Judging from what I've seen online, having separate taps for hot and cold water
For new year last year I spent it with my gf's family in Ukraine
And my gf's dad's gf was really protective about me and the cold, as its technically the first time I've been somewhere -10c was common
Like sure it was cold but it was bareable, and as long as you had a jumper and a windproof layer it was comfortable
She then explained how I wouldn't be able to cope with a Belarussian winter as its much colder than even Ukraine and is regularly -30c or less, and us brits cant deal with the cold
I explained that while technically colder it didn't feel that way
This November my gf's dad and his gf stayed in Belfast
She messaged me later explaining she was sorry, and claimed Belfast is the coldest place on earth
I felt that was a big win
What's the ball made of
Looks like catching that after someone has given it an almighty whack would hurt like a bugger
This is true to some extent for England as well, I think mainly the north of England though
Normal here as well
Can't imagine how that would be weird
>Getting out of the bed in the morning was an effort
My student house is an old Victorian property with the bathroom downstairs
In the depth of winter it takes a lot of mental strength to get out of bed and make that long journey downstairs to the shower through the cold
Especially when I'm in my underwear
Sounds like you were stalling it, the engines are not supposed to shut off every time you stop
You’re supposed to push down the clutch and brake when you stop, if you just push the brake, the engine cuts out
Did you seriously drive round starting the engine up every time you came to a stop
> I still didn't get the point of the tiny roundabouts (with three exits) when people just treated them as normal junctions
Normally it's because there's been a lot of accidents at that junction so they turn it into a mini roundabout so people are more likely to slow down and give way to their right
Hm I'm from England and never heard of this
I guess it's a regional thing
I wouldn't think it was weird if someone did but it's not like a *thing* if you get me
Moonrakers is objectively the best roundabout in the world, purely because no one knows how it works so just plows through it and we had to drive through it every time I went to my nans as a kid so it brings back happy memories
Also its a bit fucking odd to be nostalgic for a roundabout, but eh what else is there to miss
I know what you mean
It's not a done thing like turkey dinner, Queen's speech, pulling crackers etc but I don't think anybody would raise eyebrows at it
No certainly not
As an English speaker from England, this seems surreal to me
Don't even have spelling bees in England (as far as I know), which is rather confusing in my opinion
Yeah same here in England
We do have them but not as common as in America, nor as big

Norfolk: Inbred
Suffolk: Inbred

Yorkshire: a country within a country
Think Yorkshire is the best place on Earth but I've never actually heard any of them explain how
They describe Yorkshire as 'God's Own Country' which is arrogant and quite baffling
Liverpool: thieves, football mad, poor
Lancashire: rugby loving pie-shaggers
Manchester: London North who like to think they're as working class as Liverpool
North Wales: Welsh speaking, caravans, holidays for poor people
South Wales: cuckolds for the English although they probably see themselves in the mold of the rebellious Scots (they aren't, last Welsh rebellion was 600 years ago)
Lowland Scots: rowdy, dour, stingy English haters (except Edinburgh, which is where the 10 existing posh Scots reside)
Highland Scots: kilt wearing, red-haired, still live in stone huts

We used to celebrate 'harvest' when I was in school but I think this has become less common
When I moved to London I noticed that Bonfire Night isn’t really celebrated here
Back where I’m from in the East Midlands it’s a yearly tradition and pretty much every pub in the area will have a bonfire and fireworks if they have the space
There's still events you can go to, but I havent seen anyone doing Penny for the Guy since the 90s.
Also, you get a lot of people complaining about at home firework displays upsetting their pets

Land of Hope and Glory, and Jerusalem
Both would be better national anthems than the dirge we have now
I mean this in the least contentious and non-argumentative manner possible, but I know a bunch of people who cite the same reasons for not liking God Save The Queen, but ignore them when it comes to Jerusalem, and I just do not understand
I’m an atheist and a republican; I dislike GSTQ for those reasons, and similarly Jerusalem for it’s religiosity
How can you say you don’t like GSTQ because you don’t believe in God but give Jerusalem a pass
Personally I wouldn’t want either as my national anthem, but hey ho
Wagner being an anti-Semitic kinda puts a pretty big downer on *Ride* of the Valkyries
Mind if I ask why you associate it with the north
The bands from Surrey and Paul Weller wrote it about their hometown
Well yeah, I think Jerusalem is _better_ than God Save the Queen
God Save The Queen literally doesn’t even mention England
But Jerusalem still frames the love of our country in terms of Christianity, which I just cannot get past, especially since the majority of the country has been irreligious for a good few years now
I dunno
I just can’t abide it
I have no interest in religion whatsoever and I don’t like that English patriotism always has to be couched in either Christianity, monarchism, or football
Yeah, I’ll give it that
IIRC Carthago also means New City in Phoenician, and the Romans called *the Carthaginian's colony in Hispania "Carthago Nova", so literally New New City
edit* re-worded the sentence for clarification
I have very little shared history with many of the peoples of Europe
Our journey to where we are politically is not shared
I therefore do not see myself as part of the same "demos" as them
Therefore I wouldn't not like to pool my electoral power with them as they have very different interests to my own and may support laws which are not desired by my country
culture is a delicate thing that requires a certain level of management
people cannot trust the EU to be able to micromanage every culture if it were to become a large government
with freedom of movement, cultures may become overshadowed by foreign cultures because swathes of people who were apparently from their country (across europe) have entered their nation freely
they want a national government that represents their individual values or at least a party that is adapted to their national characteristics, as we have now
under a united EU these cultural differences that affect politics and necessitate different policy would be ignored and, because it's such an enormous government, they would be painted with the same broad strokes as the rest of europe
under one country there would be a sentiment of unity, even if it's not 100% mutual
enabled by freedom of movement, culture would flow around europe, eventually standardising a sterilised, diluted "european" culture — every national identity requires a culture
under a united EU a "french" (ie
intense) demonstration in paris would be treated the same as one in berlin, or madrid, or dublin — culture is the cost of unity
you would not be treated differently (ie
like how your government treat it) because a government in a different country controlling you could not truly understand your cultural and political differences
Shouldn't the Constitution of the Weimar Republic prevented the takeover
The fact that 'currently the EU had a veneer of protecting national culture' does not mean that once power is centralised that those policies will remain eternal
It comes from a distrust of where things could go once that power is centralised, not how things are right now
>I'd bet that it's not an action that the federal government of the EU would take
Eurosceptics wouldn't. That's the issue
>As for independence, what is it exactly
Loool
Ask a Latvian
>Why do you trust the British government to protect your individual rights
It does now, and it has in the past, but why do you extend that to the future
Because we have a system which has been continuous for 400 years, mate
We are in the top few most politically stable countries in Europe
I choose not to pool my democracy with countries which have only been countries (let alone democracies) for a few decades
No thanks
The EU is too much too soon for me
You're right that it would need a strong Constitution though
I don't trust the people who would be writing it that they would do so with the protection of the interests of the individual nations
I'm glad we're out and good luck to the EU
I would agree on that particular issue
What often happens instead of banning (happened in the UK) is that it became the official language of church and state, meaning that all business was conducted in that language
Over time this resulted in the erosion of native languages, but it took hundreds of years (and in Ireland's case a terrible famine)
Just a silly question
"What is independence" is a strange comment coming from a country occupied so much in it's history
Thought you might value independence more
>... and Brexit is showing precisely that
Brexit is absolutely the largest schism we've seen in our politics since the 20s and 30s.
Compare that with what has happened in your country in the last 100 years and it seems little greater than a family squabble
>The EU is not changing to anything until the citizens decide to do so, but if you don't like its current state, sure
Are you stating there aren't dozens of constitutional matters that the citizens of the EU would reject if put to popular vote
That's brave
I don't believe the European Commission is solely interested in what the people of Europe want
>Why wouldn't you trust them
They would be citizens of those same countries, representing their citizens
They are not aliens sent by who knows what to destroy the European countries
They would be citizens not any different from the current MEPs or folks at Westminster
And they would be subject to the exact same democratic mandate of every other political representative, they wouldn't get to do whatever
So, really, why the distrust
Don't really get this argument
Sylvio Berlesconi is just a citizen of his country
So is Viktor Orban
Both were democratically elected but not people *you personally* would like writing your Constitution
The European Commission is not elected by the citizens of Europe
I have very little doubt the people like Ursuala von der Leyen and JCJ will be the types actually writing it
I just do not feel part of a European Demos
Right
So what you're saying is independence is a sliding scale
Becoming part of a federal nation would be further towards the "not independent" end of the scale
>The difference between being in a federal EU and a British empire, is that the EU sees you as an equal participant, not an unruly subject with the wrong religion, and is willing to provide aid should it be necessary
As well as having an actual say in what's going on, and the knowledge that you chose to enter the agreement without a foreign army knocking on your front door
The British Empire ended 60 years ago
Get over it
> independence is a meaningless word on its own
Sounds like the sort of thing Hitler or Stalin would say
I'm not saying that's your sympathy, but to many of us, and I'm sure to many Latvians, independence is fairly simple to understand
I do have time, but some days are more rushed than others
It depends on lifestyle, my boss for instance will work until 2am so I doubt he’s doing well
I have a good meal and adequate sleep about 80% of the time I think
I’m trying to improve my work life balance as much as possible, but sometimes when work has to be done I do lose out
It’s worse for those in the city where expectations for longer hours are higher
My firm is trying to improve our mental health and work life balance so I feel like i’m able to stop and not work myself to the bone like others feel like they must
I’m an accountant for reference
London is def the most foreign due to it being soooo different to the rest of the country
Most typical would probably be somewhere like Nottingham
I live in London which is probably the most foreign feeling city because there are so many immigrants from all over the world, but i have lived here all my life so I am probably use to it and underestimating it
London is also a pretty huge city so some parts may feel more foreign than other parts
I'd say the most typical city i have been to would be Bath
It's pretty famous for its roman baths (no pun intended) yet still feels very english and uniquely typical
Might get some heat for this, but actually London
(Feels least like England) 90% of the people that I walk past aren’t speaking English, there are shops you won’t find anywhere else in the UK, cars you won’t ever see anywhere else in the UK (at least very few)
I looked it up on google maps and 'lenin statue' was a landmark listed on there
I can't imagine there's too many of them in Norway
I'd second London, I don't feel like it's *my* capital when I'm there, it just feels like a behemoth of a city that everybody from all over knows and lives in, genuinely feel like a tourist there
As for normal, I guess Sheffield for me as its where I grew up and just feels like an average interior British city
Yeah I saw the question and was like “oh I _wonder_ what everyone is going to say” lol
90% not speaking English is total bullshit FYI
Pls I dont want 20CHF pizzas ptsd
Maybe as a percentage but in London you have very different communities in one city
Like in Edgeware road there is a large Arab community, lots of Jews in Stamford hill and a massive Japanese community i use to live near (i forgot the name)
There is a small Chinatown here too
I'd say yes a lot of London does look like your classic english city but there are a lot of foreign communities
But then again i have never been to Milton Keynes
Yeah it does seem like the rest of Europe isnt aware that other cities exist in the UK even though some of these cities are big enough to completely dwarf many other European capitals
What is crazy is that I have had the same damn conversation with so, so, so, so, so many other Euopeans who have moved to London to 'learn English' for a year or whatever whilst they work in bar or something and all of them complain about how expensive 'England' is and all this chat just totally unaware there is a massive country outside of London and that the reason their rent is so expensive is because of the huge number of people wanting to do the exact same thing as them
Ok thanks for correcting me
What’s the actual percentage according to rottenox
I obviously don’t mean that, if I meant an actual figure I would have quoted a statistics website, I’ll change what I said to the *majority* of people I pass by
Note the “I” as in my experience, not yours or other Londoners
90% is just my experience, hence why I put “I” and not “Londoners”. That is an interesting way of interpreting the question
What would your answer have been if that’s the case
salty boi
True, in terms of architecture London isn't very significant
Here and there you might get a foreign styled building but for the most part it's not special compared to the rest of England
I’d rather be salty than flavourless
Reasons for: a lot of Europeans speak it already
Reasons against: it makes no sense
not romansch but romansch cause its a weird mix between french, german and italian
It would please everyone and no-one
I agree, spanish is so easy in comparison to other european languages
> You need a rational langage
Which is why you cant have a language that assigns genders to inanimate objects
Pronunciation is what

Surely a monosalybic language with much fewer sylabils is easier
Really
I've spent the past couple of years trying to lose my English accent while speaking German and only now do I find out that Germans find it cute
The hours i've wasted:(
Indeed, I have done this before
One of my housemates is Bulgarian and I wouldn't say that her accent is scary per-se, but I have definitely heard some very scary sounding Slavic accents before haha
Heard about this little thing called Brexit
I'd say bankrupting your country by spending half of your wealth on opening a banana stall on the coast of Panama is up there as well
Maybe if you hadn't ballsed that up you wouldn't have had to have spent the last three hundred years moaning about how oppressed you are by the English
No, but the atrocities we’ve committed were intentional
I don’t think many people wanted Brexit to be going this badly
Cold: Yes
Chilly: Yes
Nice: No
Warm: No
Hot: No
Personally: (celsius)
These are all approximate, I haven't put much thought into it
Cold: - -5
Chilly: -4 - 10
Nice: 11 - 22
Warm: 23 - 32
Hot: 33+
I think most Brits would agree with this
If you like grey skies and rain come on over
That's me right now
4c but it's wet outside and I didn't really dress as well as I should for it and it's freezing
Actually nursing a cup of tea and some stroopwafels right now
Just checked and I live at 51° north, so that just about qualifies me haha
It's not that bad
The sun sets at about 15:50 where I am at the moment and it can be a bit depressing but you deal with it, especially when it's all you've ever known
It's gradual anyway, and it means we also in turn get longer days in summer
You just have to put up with it
Here it only come light at about 8 in the morning and starts going dark at about 4
But if we didn't have this we wouldn't have the long summer days when it comes light at 4am and stays light until 11pm
I'm 53 degrees north
I mean, I'm only 53 north, but honestly, I dont deal with it
You can only get used to the sun rising at 9am and setting at 4pm, which I know isn't as bad as some other places but I still hate it-
Sun rises about 8 here but goes down around the same time
Why is that a plot hole
That was about the size of my university and everyone sort of new OF everyone
Wild
How is it an anomaly
First one that came to my mind as well
I love Lazio’s tbf
Love the blue and the eagle in the top
Also side note
I love both Fortitudo and Virtus Bologna’s logos for pallacanestro LBA
As a City fan, i cannot say ive enjoyed the sight of this logo
Stop this silly business of fining people for crossing an empty road when it's perfectly safe to do so
Take back the streets from the automobile and empower pedestrians again
Let's make it so jaywalking isn't a crime anywhere on this continent
Does racism count
Sensible folk
Is Helikopter preferred over Hubschrauber
Interesting
I'm fluent but nailing down register without actually living somewhere is hard
Lived in London for 4 years and only really ever went to some of the main museums once or twice (British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Science Museum)
Also never visited the Tower of London or Tower Bridge
I've been to the Houses of Parliament once (when I was younger and lived outside of London
It was pretty cool because we watched Prime Minister's Questions from the gallery above the House of Commons)
Other than that I frequently got bored in London
I was glad to leave and moved to Bath where I had a much better time
Grew up in the West country and didn't see Stone Henge till I was about 23
> you can't go right up to the stones
That's a privilege only allowed for the likes of Neil Oliver as he wonders around Stonehenge touching and rubbing up the stones, looking all pensive as he epic monologues about what it all means/the reasons for and why Stonehenge was built/the context and the society and culture of the people who built it/why it's so important in the big picture of history and how Stonehenge relates to modern Brits and modern Britain and our national story etc etc all accompanied by very beautiful cinematic shots and pretty vistas with haunting, atmospheric music playing
I went to the Sacré-Cœur quite early in the morning and although the crypt wasn’t open, it was very nice as it was almost empty
Elephant and hippopotamus I remember learning at school
Just to throw a spanner in the works; The most useful education to get here is not a degree but a trade
There is a massive shortage of plumbers, electricians, builders, bricklayers, carpenters here that many of them can charge rates that are far far far higher than most graduate jobs
Essentially in the 90s the government had the idea that *everyone* should go to university and have pushed the idea that either you go to uni or you dont get a 'real job' so hard working kids have been deterred from learning trades thus creating a massive shortage
Computer Science degrees in the UK are totally fucked on the job market now, almost as bad as most humanities degrees
Of course, as with everywhere else in Europe, the best bet by far is STEM degrees, with the caveat that Medicine in the UK pays far far worse than in the USA, but has worse conditions than a lot of countries in Europe (eg compared to France, the workload is way higher)
Therefore, the best bet is Engineering related degrees, unless you go to a really elite university, **in the UK, the type of university you went to is more important than the degree itself
** At Oxford for example, if you study Law and do well, you are setting yourself up for a very high salary indeed (potentially £90,000 starting salary), but if you did law at most of the newer uni, you'll be working in a supermarket
At the really poorly regarded unis, the best degrees for employment are ones tied to industry, eg construction management
I mean I went to a not very well regarded new university and have a graduate Civil Service job, but I'm the only guy in my entire graduating class of 2020 with a grad job so far
You say that like all graduate jobs are mentally stimulating
>But you have very little social prestige
I'm sorry, what
Please expand on that comment you utter pig headed snob
In the UK, it it is just a BA, and historically people could do it with a diploma (Assoc degree, my mother did that 10 years ago or so) or even with no university qualification earlier than that (was even possible to be a nurse without a uni qual about 40 years ago, my mum did that too lol)
Pay as a social worker in the UK is really really bad though, social work grads on average earn less than many Arts and Humanities disciplines
> It's pretty clear that a bricklayer and a professor don't hold the same social status in society, regardless of how much either are earning
By whom
You mean other academics
And this matters why
You think the wealthy bricklayers kids wont be allowed into the private school that that professors kids cant afford to go without assistance
You know its not the 1950s anymore, right
Your profession holds little to no regard over your status when compared with how you carry yourself
Pantomimes
> Well, sticking with the food theme, I think salatpizza, which is a pizza with döner kebab, iceberg, tomatoes, cucumber slices and creme fraiche dressing, is unique to Denmark, or at least Scandinavia
Fuck, I've been looking for this my whole life
I have a memory of having a pizza in Denmark with a white sauce and salad on it but I never had any idea what it was
Always wanted to have it again, it was so delicious
We also have Dandelion & Burdock, Vimto, Lilt, Karibbean Kola, Tizer and Tango
Belgium, colonising and ruining central Africa since 1918
**badly
I'm glad you see it
Drives me insane
It's like, come on Scots, let's just take responsibilty for the shit we did together
It's like we commited a huge crime spree together and when it gets to court they all of a sudden had not part and it was all our idea
Yep
The settlement of Ulster was promoted as a shared pursuit between the English and the Scottish
Just a fun thing to do together
That’s why so many unionist Northern Irish groups have the Scottish flag as one of their symbols
The Scots were well up for the whole Empire thing as well
Many, many colonial administrators, generals etc were Scottish
Many Irish too actually
Lots of Jewish people put money in swiss banks before and during the war as it was seen as a safe  place to put it
After the war many swiss banks just kept it, resisting payment with intransigence and bureaucracy
When some family members tried to withdraw the money they were told they needed to provide death certificates of for their family members
who died in the holocaust
Lindisfarne massacre of 793, England will never forget
To be fair it was done after we beat the Scots, so it wasn’t exactly the same, but many Scottish leaders were more than happy to join in
The settlement of Ulster was split pretty much 50/50  between the English and Scottish
For all the ways that Scotland has been oppressed by the English, a lot of people, Scots and non-Scots alike have no idea (or just ignore) how much Scotland benefited from the British Empire
> Yep
The settlement of Ulster was promoted as a shared pursuit between the English and the Scottish
Just a fun thing to do together
Just a cute little bonding activity
It's just young Scots to be honest
The ald ones love all of that empire stuff; bagpipes, thin red lines, kilts and all of that shit
Dunno, but I hope we get to burn the white House down again for the banter
You're not the only one who read it with that tune my friend
You got yourselves into this when you tried to colonise the Darien Gap, fall in line
More beer, I realize it’s too early and beer is basically liquid bread anyways
After four beers I'll go home and go to bed, it's not that much
After eight beers, I'd either get a döner kebab in a pitta bread with salad, or fried chicken, or I would go home and make an enormous toasted sandwich that could easily feature on /r/stupidfood
11:45 is kind of early but it's also believable - in the UK we might go to the pub and start drinking in the afternoon or early evening
For England(and it's extremely London centric as historically that's where the big, nation defining building have been built and are located, when it comes to these things, things are not very spread out in England, London has been and is the beating heart of the country, it dominates national life), and so in no particular order

Being from Italy is cheating
The Forum, Rome
I'm English, from semi rural yorkshire and cycle the 10 mile round trip to work every day
I ride a non suspension mountain bike, probably be called a gravel bike these days
I live in an area that was once known for its coal production  so this means there are 1000s of miles of trails that used to be train tracks
It's much safer than the road although do probably ride a good 35% on the road and it's somthing iv done all my life so iv always been used to it
Not sure why you would be veering out of your lane, you can easily ride a bike in a straight line
Cycling is not as seamless as it appears
Many drivers hate cyclists, others are far too nervous and that can be just as dangerous
As long as you do a little defensive riding and keep your eyes well peeled and being sensible will make the journey much safer
Sometimes just because you have right of way does not mean you should take it
I commute via bike in London and here its a mix of road bikes and hybrid bike
Personally I use a road bike as I also cycle as a sport
Completely off topic does "An European" sound wrong to anyone else
I know it's grammatically correct to use an before AEIOU but I want to say a european
No^just^me
I strongly dislike dogs, so I guess in that sense  I'm not particularly European
and possibly 1651-1660
Ah yes, the famous Dutch conquest of England
I feel like almost all the answers here are because the people visiting had little to no idea of what the city is like and just made up some ridiclious steryotype
Oh youre surprised London one the busiest and most expensive cities in the world is busy and expensive and not some sleepy picturesque image of olde England, shocking
Oh Berlin isn't full of ancient buildings and history after being totally flattened in the 40s? Colour me shocked
Oh Milan an industrial business centre isn't a quiet Tuscan town with romantic images of charming Italy
Heavens no
Oh Paris in 2019 looks very different to how it looked in 1930s French art house cinema
How dare they change it
For me Milan
I love Italy but Milan just had no charm
Marseille
Apart from the Vieux Port area of the city the whole place was a dump with questionable characters loitering around
Cardiff
Whole city smelt of piss and 90% of the restaurants ranked 3/5 or lower on Hygiene, according to the official signs in the windows
Most major European cities, as a Londoner I thought they would be more well, foreign
Once you take out the touristy bits most cities just feel like cities, very similar vibe
New York
Hot, expensive and full of crackheads
Took a trip around Italy, I was most looking forward to Venice but it was over hyped for me (and honestly the worst stop on my trip)
I fucking loved Palermo in the same way I love my friends that I only see when I wanna get fucked up, it's chaotic and dirty as shit and gave me horrific food poisoning
Sorrento
Disappointed is a strong word, its a gorgeous place, but the food wasn't as good as I expected it to be
To be fair it's quite resorty and anywhere like that tends to be a letdown on the food side
St Petersburg for me
Everything just looked the same
I much prefer Moscow and Kazan
Dublin just feels like an overpriced, not particularly great city in the UK
I just wouldn't consider Dublin to be a major European city
Its pretty small and has never really been the centre of anything thats not almost totally related to Ireland
At the end of the day every European capital cant be 'major'.
Basically if you're in Rome or Florence and an African guy comes up saying something, asking to give you something, commenting on something you're wearing, keep walking
My point being everyone expects all Italian cities to somehow be Siena or something
Less hype for there though
As I said, you cant class every capital city as a major city
Dublin has half a million people, its on the edge of Europe, it has no major industry, port or EU based parliament
Sorry but you're going to have put your pride aside and admit the in terms of being a major city Dublin is not in the same leagues as; Paris, London, Berlin, Madrid, Munich, Moscow, Rome,
but its like one of the lesser things to see in London
I dont think any British person would say 'oh London, make sure you see big ben'. Just weird that when you're saying the reason you dont like London you're listing one of the more boring aspects about it
It'd be like me saying; Oh i didnt like Berlin, the Fernsehturm is kinda dull
If you just want to see tall things why didnt you just turn around and look at The Shard then
Reading your comments here it strikes me that you like old traditional cities but didnt visit a single city in the UK thats on the tourist trail
Did you just not do any research before your trip
Perhaps come back and hit Oxford, Cambridge, Bath, York, Winchester, Durham, Edinburgh, and the Clifton area of Bristol
Did you go to Clifton in Bristol, Im guessing as you're Spanish your friend lived in Stokes Croft or St Pauls which aren't exactly the prettiest areas of the city
Great drugs though
I'm surprised at the response, but then it is London
I've never really heard it asked for,  but you'd probably annoy the bartender if you did
Typically all the house spirits are the same price,  so you'd get a follow up question along the lines of 'Light rum, dark rum, vodka, whisky or gin
My son learnt about Celts, Angles and Saxons when he was 7 or 8
...and we use Arabic numerals, Greek philosophy, and Egyptian and Chinese technologies too, but they don't receive as much focus
That Roman culture had an influence on British culture -- or any other European culture for that matter -- doesn't ipso facto prove its importance
Plenty of cultures have had influences
It is suppose to be pronounced as "aitch" but a lot of people pronounce it as "haich".
I was always taught aych as being more proper than haytch, so it's what I've learned to say
For reference I'm kinda midlands-south east and still in school
French is my second language and while I do this somewhat intuitively, I didn't really understand this was a rule per se until today (disclaimer: I have a Quebec accent in French)
Thank you
Plenty of us in the UK that say haitch tbf
Aitch is more "proper".
really
I allays viewed it as more common
Perhaps it's a class thing and the boundaries have shifted
I was going to say that, down South, it means that you didn't get the memo properly in school, but then on the other hand, it's an aitch in the proper Cockney accent isn't it
Perhaps it started to be taught as haitch in comps to try to stop the h dropping in Cockney and other similar working class accents, and that became irrelevant/unnecessary as Estuary English emerged
As a gay person there’s a few I would think twice about visiting
I’ll certainly never go to places like Russia or Belarus, and even places like Poland and Croatia are starting to look ever more hostile
Why would I visit a place that declares huge regions to be ‘LGBT-free’ or that burns effigies of gay couples
It’s terrifying
Fuck that
Other than that, I would potentially visit any European nation
Sure, there are places I want to visit more than others, but outside of feeling personally unsafe, I would check out any country
I do want to make it my mission to visit every country in europe because it's a decent and achievable challenge unlike trying to visit every country in the world
But countries I have absolutely no interest in visiting would be belarus, maldova and macedonia
Just ignore them
I mean, that is true, everyone shits on us, especially right now
I hate it
But crucially, it’s not like it’s coming from no where, is it
Wow, if there was one country I didn’t think would appear on this list, Ireland would be it
Everyone usually wanks themselves silly over Ireland
That answer was so
French
Sorry, how is the UK in the same group as those three
That doesn’t make sense
What kind of fool thinks the UK is a dictatorship
You could say the same about many big european cities
Paris for instance is much worse than London for rubbish and criminals
But being the Yorkshireman I am, I’m happy to hear you prefer the north
I live in London and I fuuuuuuuucking love it
Also, midlands erasure
It was when I went
Man, I am appalled by anti-immigrant prejudice but do not compare the two
Thanks man
: D
I mean sure, but as an English person talking to a Scottish person, don’t you think part of it is just because Ireland is very similar to Britain in many ways
It’s literally one of the world’s top travel destinations
All very true
I mean I have been to Dublin so I might have a bit more awareness than you, but while it was a nice trip to a great city, it was a very similar experience to visiting various great cities in Britain
Least we have tourists
Says who
I heard about it
I think the reason it got less coverage than the NZ shooting was likely the number of people killed (50 is a lot more than 10), the fact that it happened in another english speaking country, and that it was anti-muslim
Nope didn’t hear about it until you just said it now
It made the news here, yes, but it was like a brief mention
Then the Christchurch shooting happaned and the Brazil school shooting was not mentioned after
What school shooting
Also, it can go beyond reasonable force if the assailant attacks you in your house
But it can’t be grossly disproportionate force
Even then - when Mary I married Philip II of Spain, Parliament were very clear that this was a personal union only, dissolved on either one's death: Philip held no power in England and any children of the marriage would be heirs only to the throne of England, not Spain
He was basically to be a regal sperm donor
Nottingham
Originally ‘Snotingaham’, meaning “the home of Snot’s people”, with Snot being the name of an Anglo-Saxon chieftain
My city is named after a guy called Snot
Bristol
Now Bristol is both a city and a county
It has many possible etymologies/name origins, and nobody is certain which is correct
The word may come from the Old English Anglo-Saxon "Brycgstow", meaning the "place at the bridge". Although even earlier recorded place names in the Bristol area include the Roman-era British Brythonic-Celtic word "Abona" (derived from the name of the Avon) and the archaic Welsh "Caer Odor" ("fort on the chasm") that 'chasm' most likely refering to [Avon Gorge] I digress, but the archaic Welsh "Caer Odor" which may have been calqued as the modern English Clifton(which actually is an area in Bristol near Avon Gorge)
Also as mentioned the origin of Bristol again might go back further to Celtic Britain times, drawing on the Celtic words 'braos' and 'tuile' etc meaning to describe 'a stream through a chasm'... It's one of those two either Saxon or Celtic, but we just don't know which one
But considering Bristol's geographic location right nextdoor to Wales, it's Celtic British origin as a major settlement, said chasm etc etc
Making an educated guess im going with the Welsh/Brythonic British Celtic origin for the name Bristol
The Saxons most likely just adopted that already existing name for the settlement when they came on the scene
York comes eventually from the Roman Eboracum (which *may* come from a Celtic *Eburas, but the Romans were the first to settle)
"Ebor" for short became Eoforwic to the Anglo-Saxons, then Jorvik to the Vikings, then gradually into York
My hometown is [Walton] in Somerset, England
The name comes from the settlement/farmstead of the Wealas (Native Celts)
The first part of the word is Old English, Wahl, and can mean ‘foreigner’, ‘Briton’. Ton is Old English for ‘estate/enclosure’. Wiki suggests the Wealas continued living/farming there and took on the culture of the Anglo Saxons to climb the social ladder (as was the case for many places) and as such forgot their language
Southampton just means south by the river I believe
They should change it back for a laugh
This is really interesting, I visited two years ago and thought it was lovely
Bit embarrassed I was pronouncing it incorrectly
It’s just like purrrrrrrr (rolled r)
No longer accurate to say all the top universities are Russel Group, some pretty average universities like Southampton are in there too
LSE significantly stronger than LBS, if you are doing economics or finance, it's an equal or better to Oxford or Cambridge
Also the full name of LSE is London School of Economics and Political Science, so it's very very good for Political Science, though not the equal of Oxford or Cambridge in that anymore imho
Kings
Would add Sciences Po to that list too, one of the best places for Politics in the world
Yeah, and I'm saying its in the Russell Group but not what I would consider an 'elite uni'
I think it's much the same in England
I can't speak for the rest of the UK, but there's not much - if anything - here that I'm aware of
Even famous creatures like elves or giants are other cultures' folklore, not ours
Not a film bur Breaking Bad wouldn't have made sense because he would have had his treatment paid for on the NHS
In Bruges wouldn't work because Bruges isn't in England
German Highways are a different story
But
The Witcher's real

Driving on the other side is pretty easy
Can only be challenging if youre doing it in a British car

Switzerland also has a different plug, it's like the rest of the EU but with an earth pin and hardly any travel adapters support it

Just sharing a fun fact of the day for any folks out there who might be reading this thread is all
Knowledge is power as they say
whether or not to put the milk in first when making a cup of tea
Whether or not you enjoy marmite
Isn't it a bit much to have kefir and smetana together
I like both, but I wouldn't have that much dairy in the same meal
You know that they call them "cobs" round Nottingham way
Fucking lunatics, literally nobody else in the country calls them that
Tea cake
Come at me
My wife sometimes puts the milk in with the teabag
She's foreign and therefore could be excused
However, divorce is an option
On the topic of brown, I tried explaining what Lea & Perrins is to a room full of assorted European coworkers
It proved impossible
Can you explain it
It's got anchovies, but it's not a fish sauce
It's savoury, but also sweet
You put it in a bloody Mary, or on toasted cheese, or in bolognaise
It's something like 150 years old and coincidentally that's how long a single bottle usually lasts
No, it's:
Breakfast, brunch, lunch, tea, dinner, supper
Midnight snack
It's no wonder we're all so obese
Tea is a drink, not a meal
I don't know why this challenges people so much
Oh yeah, and second breakfast
Czech Republic is cool
I've been to Prague (obviously) and also Karlovy Vary which is a break from the crowds
For me it's Germany
I love the lakes and mountains of Bavaria, the abundance of picturesque medieval towns, the food that is great for someone with a sweet tooth like me, Christmas markets, the people etc
I love France, I used to get the ferry every Summer for my family holiday and had so many great times
I’d love to do the same with my kids one day
I love the language and the slightly different culture
It’s beautiful too and quite diverse in landscape
A lot of people only think about Paris, but there’s so much more to see
Wales: I love the history, landscapes (particularly Snowdonia); the friendly people, the architecture
I am in bliss after a long hike up a peak in the Glyderau, relaxing next to the log burner reading a book
There's a feeling of comfort and cosiness that I get straight away as soon as I cross over to Wales that I've never had in England, or any other place
Runner up: Switzerland  I'm fascinated by the Canton system and how well everything (from what I've seen) works
It's also the most immaculately clean country I've visited
It almost doesn't seem real
Yeah France is my other one
I went for the first time in 2001 and we stayed in the Brittany region as well as Normandy (mainly Mont Saint-Michel) and it's all very beautiful
Paris is iconic and there's a lots to do but there's a ridiculous amount of places in the rest of the country worth visiting
And severe apartheid
Wrong word
I meant segregation
yeah I think that's why
Music, literature, the visual arts etc
sometimes I think that a hell of a lot of tourists are there just because of Harry Potter

Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland
His corpse was found guilty of murdering a king, sentenced to death and executed (no, really)
Contemporary historians often consider his actions against Irish Catholics to be genocide
Disgraced Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox
My other thought was David Mellor
But genocide and posthumous execution are a little more extreme than sucking a Spaniard's toes whilst wearing a Chelsea kit
Actually the opposite, moved from England to America for my dads job and for him it hasn’t changed bc his contract basically said he gets the same sick days and stuff if he works in America, but the American sick / vacation day system for people we know is awful in general and in comparison( 2 weeks for vacation 6 Months apart  and >5 sick days where my dad gets 4 weeks vacation whenever he wants in the year and 7 days sick, both excluding holidays ) , but the American work environment itself is a lot more chilled out and he’d say a lot better
Terrible biscuit selection, though
Don't get me wrong you definitely have a better selection for 90% of things but the cookie aisle was literally just variations of cookies, whereas here you have cookies and millions of different types of biscuits
Fuck your oranges
Did you know this prize clown is currently in the running to become prime minister
The depressing likelihood is that he's going to come second to an even bigger gusset botherer called Boris Johnson
Such as
To be fair, you did give condolences to the Nazis when Hitler killed himself
yeah it was adolf hitler and the nazis were already beaten, i don't think the nazis were in any position to get mad that the irish didn't send a card
wait are you being sarcastic now
you mean the japanese who also surrendered a few months later and who never had the ability to threaten europe in any way
edit: it's not like hitler wouldn't have just invaded ireland if the uk had fallen anyway
my point is that there was no need for ireland to send condolences for hitler dying due to supposed neutrality when there was absolutely no chance of ireland facing repercussions for doing so
this is a lot of words to say a bunch of stuff that i don't disagree with and im unsure where you got the impression that i do
all i've said is that sending condolences to nazi germany is an incredibly hilariously dumb thing to do when they would've faced absolutely no downsides for not doing so
>are we going to start calling all of the other countries who were neutral and who’s politicians also signed the book Nazis too
i mean in a broad sense these countries could be called nazi sympathisers so sure
>I think it’s totally wrong to say that neutral countries sympathised with Nazis, that completely defeats the purpose of neutrality
they literally sent sympathies to the nazis so they're nazi sympathisers by definition
Quite

One of my favourite phrases is “suck it and see”, which just means to try something new to find out if you like it or if it’s effective
“Steve invited me to his birthday outing, but I’m not sure if I’ll enjoy go-karting
I guess I’ll just have to suck it and see
The actual definition is quite innocent but obviously the connotations are delightfully filthy
So bawdy and suggestive
Very British indeed
Huh, maybe one of those is common to German
There's a Rammstein lyric in *Rosenrot* which goes:

(maybe Ireland can't get TVs because they don't run on potato power)
And us and the Irish
This guy is definitely from Eastern Poland
I've heard the submarine joke, but with Ireland
It's going great ta
Lovely trip down Londonderry the other month
About 10-13°c but it feels warm because I’m on break
the “room” I just left is -22°c, I work in a freezer
Every 10 years or so they hold a referendum
Knowing that once they get that 50
01% win there's no going back
Don't worry mate, they're working on it
Yeah I was being playful
You'll have another one the second the polls are at 50
01%.
Norway are joining that Union one way or another
As are Switzerland
No that ship has sailed
I think it would be possible without Freedom of Movement but that is not acceptable to the EU so we are becoming more like Canada to the EU
The border will remain open for Croatians to holiday as Boris does of course
Well yes it certainly seems we upset a lot of people by taking over their countries so swiftly so I can see why you think that mate
Well they're not new words, but toe curling, cringe, cringey etc is what we'd use and say in the UK
How walkable is your city alone at night
And what city are you in
How likely are you to get hurt, robbed or anything
Edit: well 250 replies in and it seems like the UK is by far the most dangerous
I’m honestly surprised
London England, depends very much on the area
In general though if you keep your head down and dont show off any valuables you'll be fine
I am of course saying this as a cis man so I'm sure other perspectives might be different
I’m in Bristol, england
I’d feel safe as a woman walking around pretty much everywhere in Bristol alone at night honestly
But others would say I’m brave
London
Avoid parks and other 'remote' places at night
Dont walk through estates you dont know at night
Dont get too close to large groups of teenagers at night
I was mugged once in 28 years where I live on the outskirts of Liverpool
My friend was beaten up for talking back to a group of lads who shouted abuse at him late at night
These sort of things happen every so often but I wouldn't say the city is unsafe
It's probably less safe the younger you are because the offenders are usually groups of young boys who feel like they have something to prove
Wild dogs
Most of Bristol is alright but there is def some places like the underpasses between St Pauls and Easton at night which should be avoided
I know things have gotten better but it used to be impossible to walk up Park Street on a Friday/Saturday night without seeing blood on the streets
Just soooooo much drunken violence, like it was totally normal in the early 2000s to watch multiple fights on Park Street around 2am
I’m also in england, what city are you
hmm that's interesting perspective to me as I'm also a queer guy in South London although I guess I'm naturally "straight passing" as I'm closeted Bi
I think that's really sad you have to hide that part of yourself for but i totally understand your reasons for doing so
I wish this area was a lot more accepting of that :(
that's absolutely horrendous, baffling to me that something like that can bring out such a violent reaction from complete strangers
I hope you're safe where you are
Coming out is not even in my mind right now as I still live with my incredibly homophobic family
I've tried bringing the subject up to them in a purely academic way and the long and short of their belief system is: There's no such thing as bisexuality, you're either gay or straight and if you're gay you're going to hell
I have plans to move out soon after lockdown though
I'm completely with you, i can't wait for clubs to open again so i can explore my sexuality in peace
I have one of these
They’re such beautiful instruments to both listen to and play
There’s normally also a course in Älvkarleby during August which I’d recommend going to if you ever wanted to learn, though probably after things have calmed down COVID-wise
Where i live (London) bunch of stuff really, Royal family events (beheadings and what not), Various political things like starting wars with everyone etc etc
Where im from (Bristol) mostly where ships cast off to go and discover the new world like the Matthew or where ships left to go take part in the Atlantic slave trade a few hundred years later
Sheffield - birthplace of modern steelmaking on an industrial scale
My village is pretty insignificant but the nearest town is known by quite a few people for having a pub bombed by the IRA in the 80s cos lots of British soldiers drank there
Which city
I thought Sheffield with the Stainless Steel
Go to England, no matter what you do you’ll be a saint compared to us
leave
In England you can get bags of sweet and salty popcorn
what
why would you even-popcorn deserves better
You and me both buddy
The only one I can think about that is generally applied to Europe as a whole is the idea that Europe is overrun by evil muslims and that our liberal ways are to blame for their impending domination
Aside from the fact that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful, less than 4% of EU citizens are Muslim
It’s just an absurd conservative American talking point, which manifests as bold assertions that entire cities in Europe are ‘no-go areas’ now under sharia law
As bizarre as it is racist
The stereotype that we are all left-wing
>Worst is the people from these actual European countries playing along and confirming that it’s so fucking great here
This is why I give Americans on here the benefit of the doubt
So many Europeans here actively play up to the stereotypes, and then complain about them
Drives me crazy
TBF you could say the same thing about us when we say we wanna visit the US
There are so many varying parts that it must be irritating for Americans to hear
>Vinnie Jones punching the Swiss guards at the Vatican
I could imagine that happening tbh
I would agree
We're technically apart of it but we're not a core European state
I feel the same way about Scandinavia, in some ways, as it's effectively an island fTom mainland Europe
lwywydlwdydlyd wylldywdyalydywld, aye
A part
I made a very popular NSFW post(one of my post upvoted ever) yesterday where it featured a Czech guy, and in the title right at the start i reffered to said Czech guy as being from Central Europe not Eastern Europe etc
See so some of Western Euros are learning and have got the message
Mid sized town, England
That would get me a lovely detached house,  a decent amount of land
Four or more bedrooms
I reckon a nice sized 3 bed house with garden in a desireable area of my city, and my city is fashionable anyway (Bristol)
I live in a rural town in the south of England
You could buy a small 3 bedroom house for that around here
Similar pricing to here in Nottingham, though a townhouse of that design and quality would be more
and in london you get a studio flat with a shared kitchen
Wow I didn’t imagine Poland to be so expensive
That's crazy
In London it's the opposite, house prices have gone up more than rent has, 2k would be ridiculous (I know you can easily pay that here but you don't need to)
I guess it's a case of more foreign property investing and a higher allowed multiplier (I've heard of people getting a 5
5x mortgage, which goes a long way if you're earning £150k as a couple
Obviously most people aren't earning that, but those that are live in London mostly)
I need street name I'm afraid
Also CC number and mother maiden name please
Harry Ramsden’s; it’s a place that serves fish and chips but it’s quite expensive and you’re better off going to a local chippy for an ‘authentic’ experience
I remember being really disappointed when I visited Neuschwanstein
For years I've always wanted to go and even had it as my desktop background lol
I was pretty deflated when I finally arrived and it felt like an unfinished movie set
I know it's not an old castle at all but I guess that I wasn't expecting it to look that polished
Also the tour was really short
The plus side was the amazing cream and pumpkin soup I had after
I’ve changed my mind on Brexit
Well sqiudward, welcome to the apocalypse, I hope you like leather
Glad we're leaving the EU
A centralised European parliament is a lobbyists dream
You get to bypass the middle man that is individual national parliaments and get your corporate policy enacted over the whole continent with way less bribes
> As a Hungarian I'm used to corrupt old cucks who are not representing me by any means
We were just sold the expectation that the EP is better than that
I think in some ways a centralised European parliament is a lobbyists dream
Instead of lobbying 27 indiviudal national parliaments you can skip the middle man and go straight to the EP and get your corporate policy spread over the whole continent at once
&#x200B;
US-style lobbying, here we come
Whats wrong with dipping crusts
Let's be honest though, most of us are eating shitty frozen or fast food pizzas
Maybe what you say is true or high quality Italian pizzas but for the average one I get from the supermarket, the crust is definitely more enjoyable with a sauce than without
Fish fingers though
Can't speak for the whole country because its such a varied place, but for the Midlands:
Pros: Good transport, trains and busses connect the major cities and are of good quality
Cons: Very expensive cost of living for what it is, cold and wet, pretty miserable at times and a lack of interesting landscapes that makes me feel pretty trapped (Peak District is nice tho)
Pros: Historical and cultural sites around every corner, good standard of living, for most that is, people are very interesting
Cons: The government is incompetent, everything's expensive and Brexit is a thing
I dunno
dessert-wise you’re doing super well
Frankly, I love the weather, and I think our cuisine has been HIGHLY underrated
Could do with some better architecture though  -- side effect of being bombed repeatedly
Yep yep yep
Spot on
Speaking for Yourshire here
Pros: The tea we have is better than anywhere else, cheap transport, theres a kabab shop around every corner
Cons: Wet weather most of the time, most places stink of cigarette smoke
Technically not another country, but the Welsh national anthem is very beautiful
I also like the Italian and Portuguese national anthems, I've read the English translations
I used to like it, but the line about us never being slaves kinda ruined it after I learnt more about Britain’s involvement in the slave trade
Kind of a dickish line when considered in that context
Wales is very much another country
Says you’re a Scot on your flair
Jerusalem is my favourite
Wow Portugal, I thought we had something special
Scottish is not a Celtic anthem
Most Scottish people are not 'Celtic'. But yes, I agree
Sure
And that is to be commended
Still super fucked up
I guess he does
I get that, just confusing
There’s a  one if that helps
We were drunk, not thinking straight
I swear that’s not who we usually are
> we support turkey and love turkey
Really
Since when were Aussies massive fans of Erdogan
Saying you support and love a country you are going to be talking about its political rulers as much as the rest of the country
Saying you support and love the people would be a diffrent statement
Sorry but theres a huge difference between 'not having a problem' and 'support and love'. Like I dont have a problem with Chad because I have never been there and im not really sure what their politics are, whilst I support and love no countries really as thats an incredibly strong thing to say but I would say I have fond feeling towards countries like Canada
Are you up to date with modern Turkish politics
Like do you know what Erdogan is all about
Aberfan - A coal slag heap slid onto a school
Windscale - A nuclear fire at what is now Sellafield
Are you talking about the Great Fire of London 1666
Yeah, that's a big one, but, I thought the OP was asking about sort of recent ones
England and Wales are both part of the UK, that's why I included both
Okie doke, no harm, no foul
York ham is almost unknown here (I live in York) - from what I gather it's a long and Labour-intensive curing process that's difficult to mass-produce, so it sort of died
Whereas I believe in Spain, *Jamón de York* is a generic phrase meaning any cooked ham
I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong
Otherwise, most stereotypical English food is eaten, if rarely
I don't think I've ever encountered cucumber sandwiches cut into little circles in the wild, for instance
Yeah afternoon tea is the sort of thing you might take your grandma or mother to for mothers day or their birthday if they're in to that sort of thing
Or maybe you're on a day trip to somewhere and you want to do something to break the afternoon up, have a sit down with some tea a cake is great if you've been walking around shops/museums all day
More than once I've come across Americans thinking that a "Cream Tea" meand putting cream in your cuppa
I've been to a fair few restaurants across France and i swear onion soup is *always* an option
Aye but had my first full Scottish breakfast couple years when I was up at a mates
The haggis and tattie scones alone makes it top the English breakfast imo
Divine stuff
Even the word “regional” is generous
Are associated with the East End of London; literally one area of one city
Literally never even heard of eating eels till I saw that Vice video about the eel and pie shop in east london
They’re not specifically a british thing really
that'd be fettuccine al toro
We have the knock on wood
If theres no wood
around you can use your head
> if you hick up that meas someone is speaking about you that moment
For some reason that reminds me of one we have where if you get a sudden shiver or shudder for no reason (not like cos you're cold) that's meant to mean someone walked over your (future) grave
Creepy haha
If the wind changes your face will stay that way

Classissm is incredibly rife and impacts all parts of society
Very rarely do friendships even cross class boundaries
Terrible poverty issues over here, 1 in 4 children live in poverty (1 in 3 even in Milton Keynes)
That’s truly horrific
So sorry you have to deal with shit like that
When I was in Dublin we took a taxi and the driver was, in addition to being a racist, complaining about the cyclists and the police helping them
He even pointed out a policeman on the street who he actually recognised and angrily called a “fat pig”; the guy had apparently assisted a cyclist whom the driver had run into, and made it clear that the driver was in the wrong and liable for damages
It was wiiiiiild
Social class isn’t entirely about wealth here, more just whatever class you were raised around
You can be upper class and poor
Same as Wayne Rooney will always be working class despite being wealthy
I think the 'zoning laws' and 'building restrictions' is deliberately overplayed
Land banking is the true scandal
And its the neoliberals who drive this
>[A little digging into the latest financial reports of  the top 10 housebuilders reveals a very different story
Between them,  they have a staggering 632,785 building plots on their books, of which  more than half have planning permission
At the same time, these 10  companies reported building a total of just 79,704 homes – which means  they have, on average, eight-years’ worth of plots in their land banks at the current rate of construction
&#x200B;
>[The analysis of housing ministry (MCHLG) figures showed that in 2016-17,  planning permission for 313,700 new homes was given, but only 183,570  homes built, meaning a notional annual gap of more than 130,000 homes,  the biggest divergence since records began in 2006
The difference is always accent, tastes, mannerisms, attitudes etc
The things you learn from your family, school, peers etc
If an upper class person lost their wealth they’d still retain the above, you don’t lose your background
If they were still poor by the time they had kids their kids probably wouldn’t be considered upper class though because they’d be surrounded by upper class family but middle or working class peers at school and wherever they live
Caste systems are all about inheritance aren’t they
Whereas here, again using Wayne Rooney as an example, his kids would be middle class despite having working class parents because they’ll presumably go to private school and be surrounded by middle class people
I think caste systems are more rigid although I’m not that familiar with them, isn’t it quite specific to India also
This'll be fun for the UK
Erm, my money will have to be on Wales
That's mostly because I can't think of anyone who dislikes Wales, jokey or otherwise
Online or not
Theres only one joke everyone is UK can think to go to about them but noone seems to actually get riled up or actually annoyed at Wales
Probably due to a low population and the way they're integrated into UK
Mostly every region takes the piss out of eachother here anyway (mostly based on v historical events)  Manchester and Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow, yorkshire and Lancashire, Scottish lowlands and highlands, North and South of England and everyone and London
I'm sure there are plenty of other regions with rivalries I'm forgetting
Just seems to be what we do
Probably Cornwall is nearest to your description
But in the UK every place is hated
Good point of another division in the UK
Admittedly, I was referring to all Wales together
The same tired joke I mentioned I think are generally referred to all Welsh outside Wales no matter where they are from
Honestly I dont know much about the relationship between N Wales and S Wales
If you're asking me personally, I grew up in Manchester so most of my personal experience of Wales was North Wales (Anglesey, etc)
What about people from Devon
Devon is south west lol
I can't understand those highlanders in Edinburgh, or in its big suburb of Glasgow
You could just buy regular cream and leave it in the back garden
When i visited Moscoe in January is was minus 27
I had never experienced it
I got on a bus and the inside of the bus was frozen with ice everywhere
It hurt to breathe
Haha
I loved it though
Are you in Winnipeg
It was an old coach type bus and it was as cold inside as outside
This was no where near the centre i was staying in a residential area that was named after a Physicist or an astronaught i cant remember the name of the area
I heard it hits like 40° in the summer too
It sounds like the middle of canada has the worst possible climate
I remembered
I was in Korolyov
It was Korolyov
Yeah it’s considered cheap-tier in England
It’s extremely popular though because of how cheap it is
I live in East Yorkshire; everyone worships Lidl and Aldi here
Yeah they can, don’t really know how common it is but it can and does happen here
For example, I’m a man and my best friend since I was about 10 years old is a woman
unambiguously yes
Definitely, most of my best friends are girls, I don’t see the point in saying that boys and girls shouldn’t be friends, if I get along with them, feel comfortable and have a laugh that’s all I’m looking for, their gender isn’t an issue
It depends
If I don’t know the person I sometimes say “Hello Espionage speaking”. If it’s a professional call then I’d say the above plus ...”from Espionage work place”. Often however I’ll just say “Hello”.
I do that if it’s an unknown caller
I started doing it when I started getting spam calls
England was fully unified in 927 under [Æthelstan] rule, making the country ~1093 years old (though much progress towards unification had already been made by Alfred the Great in the latter part of the 800s)
Of course England no longer exists as an independent country
The UK came into being only in 1801 (hence 219 years old) through the merger of the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain, but this could kind of be viewed as essentially a continuation of the Kingdom of Great Britian, just with Ireland incorporated in
Now the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed in 1707 when the England and Scotland united into one (England and Scotland had shared the same monarch for many years prior)
So if this view was taken the UK would be 312 years old instead
1066 I believe with the Norman conquest
William is seen as the first english king so idk
England was still multiple kingdoms until then so it was kind of the official unification of England
I never said I was a historian
Just going off of what little we learn in school about our history
Even that horrible histories song only starts at William
Cheers for the information though
Google is a very good tool
I’d would pay for delivery
Though my dad has a van so would actually use that
If not then rental vans aren’t too expensive
Renting a small van is usually super cheap compared with car rentals
That being said most decent sofa companies will include delivery
> Load bearing wall
> Carpenter
That combination strikes fear into my heart
I mean, I *know* wooden buildings are structurally sound, but still, I feel better with stone/breeze block (cinder block)/brick holding up the roof
Though our internal walls that aren't load bearing are typically drywall (known as plasterboard here) which means, yeah, they're easy to put up/take down
Skirting boards or under floor boards
Yeah lots of Brits feel like Australians are similar to us but their country feels more like the US in terms of city planning etc
Yeah quite middle class and had a nanny, but i find mentioning that though is usually grounds for having the piss taken out of you
Kind of, we did Food and Nutrition as a subject until year 10 and then you could keep doing it if you wanted to do it for GCSEs
Yes, we have food tech, most schools do it, it's mandatory until year 9 when you can either continue it or drop it
Some schools offered textiles and most schools offer design technology which is "woodworking" for y'all Americans
Most people here did but it was generally something that happened once per year, although some people will have had it more often
It was seen more as a treat than as an actual subject in my school
Yes we had Food Technology in my school during Year 7 to 9 (age 11 to 14)
It was rotated throughout the year along with textiles, resistant materials and woodwork so everyone got to do all 4
We’d get given a list of ingredients to buy at the end of the lesson
We’d bring them in to school and drop them off in the classroom in the morning, ready for our 2 hour lesson after lunch
All I can really remember making is garlic bread
This was a grammar school in England in the mid 2000’s.
Yeah, we have ‘Design and technology’. Well i finished school > 10yrs ago so it may have changed
For the first 3 years of secondary school (ages 11-13 roughly), we did a rotation of lessons in Food (cooking all sorts, cakes, pasta, made mayonnaise once too but can’t remember what else), wood work, metal work, IT - think it was called SCAT (programming traffic lights and lazer printing etc) and then textiles (sewing/fabric work)
In 4th year you got to choose which one you wanted to do your GCSE in, i did food
Yeah i did a gcse in food techology
Also from down south
Plenty of Brits retire to the continent and fail to learn the language(s) so we really haven’t got a leg to stand on
I think it’s important when getting citizenship, obviously in situations where they are immigrants fleeing war or something along those lines that can be addressed at a later date
All in all though to be a citizen of a country you should know the language to an upper intermediate level or higher, not including those who have a dual citizenship or something similar, but if they’re living there then I’d say it’s crucial
Do you speak many other languages
I imagine it's very similar in every country
You don't need a single qualification to be a Guardsman
Are US Marines notorious for for their spelling proficiency
>slang dialects are taking over
What are you talking about
We have less accents now in England now than ever
How do you think people sounded 100 years ago when most hadn't left their town
We don't like our neighbours
I haven’t seen my neighbours since I was about 5
Over 10 years now
Three days a week I work from home
I do have a 5 min drive to take the kids to school though, and another one to pick them up
One day a week, it's a 10 min drive to a train station then a 40 minute train ride followed by a 10 min walk
Once every other week it's a 90 min drive to another city
I could take the train, but it's slower than driving and my car never gets canceled
On a good day, a 9 minute drive
Anything longer than 30 mins commute is unacceptable to me
It’s a waste of so much of my life
There was a Greek guy at my uni named Hercules Which I always thought was awesome
Theseus is another great Greek one
Joachim & Emil are pretty cool names
Hector
I also like Hans
Vladimir is a good name but I worry in this country people would think it was a bit ... vampire-ish
I love the Russian versions of men's names
If I had kids I'd be very tempted to give them all Russian names
I don't really like Oscar, it sounds a bit obnoxiously middle class to me
My youngest brother is named Victor, after his maternal Great Grandfather (Stepmum is half Ukrainian, half Dagestani)
Went years thinking it was spelt with a K, but it turns out my parents had decided to anglicise it
Probably about 50
If inheriting a home counts as moving out
In the UK we "move out" when we go to university but not usually fully
You'll normally still come back home during university breaks and most people live at home after they leave university for a bit
Is this not common in Russia
I  don't see how Subutai isn't the greatest general ever
He spent his entire life spanking whoever he was pointed at
Russians, Chinese, Turks, Iranians, Poles, Hungarians, etc
East Midlands English is only a minority dialect in the same way that speaking with a Yorkshire or Bristolian accent is, but it’s an accent than is so often ignored or overlooked that when it does appear in mainstream media, it’s always a shock
There’s [clips] of Conan O’Brien and Angelina Jolie saying ‘ay up me duck” and it’s the most jarring thing imaginable
My god, what the hell was that
As a person who has spent half my life living on Tyneside and therefore am very familiar with the accent and dialect, that was the worst imitation of a Geordie accent I’ve ever heard from a person by a country mile
And it was deemed good enough to broadcast on tv
He sounds more Irish than he does Geordie, with a few random Geordie dialect words thrown in there, probably to try and make it sound more convincing
People with awful teeth
Bad teeth
Eating crumpets
So annoying
Depends where in the UK you live
In the north "cunt" is incredibly common and how insulting it is depends on the context
All of it
They can't hide the leprechauns forever
And in a couple of days I will initiate the annual ritual of failing to get tickets in the lottery
I was speaking to Sweden yesterday and they said you’re a bunch of douchebags
Always victims
Dude shut the fuck up
It's the victim mentality I'm eluding to
You've been independent for nearly 100 years and you still constantly bang on about the English
That sticking two fingers up at someone was a universal offensive gesture like the middle finger
I thought dairy milk was a big thing, I mean yes they do have it in other countries but I was thinking it would be like a huge thing
That there are seven continents
In the UK we see North America and South America as individual continents, but I gather that many countries see them as a single continent
In the UK: Europe, Africa, Antartica, Asia, Oceania, North America, South America
(Everywhere else
): Europe, Africa, Antartica, Asia, Oceania, America
When I went to Germany my host family literally only drank that aha
Looks very similar to our chippies
Beans on toast is genuinely one of my favourite meals in the world
Nothing is as comforting
I like the beans with the little sausages
I like to cook the beans down so the sauce becomes really thick and the beans become mushy
I butter the shit out of the bread so that the butter mixes in with the sauce and becomes really rich
I also like to heavily pepper the beans so they get a little kick
Perfection
I mean across the pond, we have an entire theme park equipped with a factory tour and a 4D cinema dedicated to Cadbury Dairy Milk so I guess that kicks Hershey’s butt
Sort of thing id expect from the Americans
Looks quite similar from Google images
A little takeaway food shop with a load of fried stuff on display
You poor soul, I hereby grant you dual British and Irish citizenship, though you must know that Hershey is rapidly growing and is readily available pretty much everywhere
Hey, Cadbury world is the shit, who doesn’t like learning about a Quaker Victorian bloke who made an entire village for his factory workers
Sure, like the Americans
Not patriotic but a celebration of joy, shared culture and history of your country
Right
Sticky
Toffee
Pudding
When it’s good, it’s toe-curlingly good
Like, When Harry Met Sally cumming at the table good
I’ve had three course meals at fancy-schmancy restaurants in which STP was the best thing by a country mile
Honourable mentions go to Victoria Sponge cake and Strawberry Trifles
[Rhubarb Crumble] and or [Apple Pie] both served with custard
When it comes to the culinary arts, we Brits imo really do have the best desserts in the world, we are world leaders in the field of sweet treats
My mother is a particular fan of syrup and cheese, you seem like you might appreciate this - I personally find it weird but she says it's tasty and completely normal
That we have been a democracy for a long time, we didn't have universal suffrage till 1918, only just over a hundred years
That we held out "alone" after the Fall of France until Barbarossa and Pearl Harbor
Alone except for the Empire, of course - Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, the West Indies, etc etc
And all those Free French, Polish, Czechoslovak, Dutch, Danish, Belgian Norwegian etc guys
And increasingly the US - even before they entered the war they were running convoy escorts, letting us buy arms on very good terms and sharing intel
Hasn't France won more wars than any other nation in world history
Yeah, but between China, India and America I reckon that's about half the world's population right there
Its not beer, but in the UK we have mulled wine and or mulled cider as a special christmas booze drink
Christmas time is the only time you'll see such mulled drinks
It's not a mainstream thing, but a lot of smaller craft breweries do a seasonal ale, usually a darker, maltier beer and sometimes spiced
Traditionally they have corny and/or rude pun names and a cartoony label
Log burners are quite common where i live, South West England countryside
We generally have a log burner in the living room but would also have central heating to heat the rest of the house
My parents have one but it's not the primary way they heat their house
You never learnt about the transatlantic slave trade or the Raj
Hong Kong, Singapore
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Sendai, Sapporo, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Fukushima

**sorry
Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Toyota,
Off the top of my head without googling(in no particular order, i apologise in advance for the bad spelling, i know quite a few from watching the rugby world cup, and ive been following the J-League for years plus lastly im really into sumo(im a big fat chubby guy myself, so over the years ive become a big fan of the sport and these amazing athletes) and im really into Japanese gay porn(especially big muscular, buff and chubby thicc/muscle-chub Japanese guys, that's my fav type of Japanese porn), so ive come to hear of alot of Japan's cities that way etc i digress)
but the Japanese cities i can name are
Tokyo/Endo, Osaka, Kashiwa, Fukishima, Kumamoto, Nigata, Iga, Sapporow, Fujiisowa, Kobe, Toyota, Yokohama, Kyoto, Kofu, Ibaraki, Fukuokka, Shizuokka, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Nagoya, Gunma, Nagoka, Saitama, Kamaishi, Tosu, Koriyama, Kawasaki, Suzuka, Aki, Sendai, Ueda, Nagano, Sakai etc etc

Ugh can’t believe I forgot Kobe
I think most of the current cabinet, or least some of the senior figures
Opposition politician leader is now more popular than our Prime Minister in recent polls so things are going to be interesting for sure
Boris Johnson, I don’t even have to say why, I’m sure you lot already know what he’s done in the past few months
Probably Michael Gove
He was the minister of education for several years and is responsible for a lot of current problems in our schools
Also a very punchable face
Nah twitter is fuelled with criticisms of his and his government currently
Everyone I know can’t stand him other than the odd conservative friend of mine
We did a fair bit in WW1 and WW2
Ramsay MacDonald
Christ you know you're an alcoholic when you promise a kingdom to a shite brand of cider
Dear Nazi Germany,
Gutted to hear about Hitler :(
Sending hugs and prayers xxxx
You shouldn't be drinking that bollocks anyway, you're not a 15 year old girl in a field
Anything to do with politics
Well
what to pick
Brexit…
That bacon sandwich is responsible for Brexit
Anytime I use public transport outside London
The huge differences between where I am and say London
Seeing the size of the people who live in Northern England
Not saying obesity isnt a thing in the south but being from a wealthy area of a wealthy city you never really see any
Whilst city centers in the north, oh my
Yeah
I don't think many people realise Welsh is the proper daily spoken language in most of North Wales until they visit
I certainly didn't.
Whereabouts are you
Pretty much
Blew my mind seeing school kids riding the tube on their own
Not far off London actually either, the Midlands
When we converge on every Mediterranean party/holiday resort and drunk disgusting amounts of alcohol and proceed to shout, swear, fight, puke, and shag
I've never finished a cup of tea
Can't stand the stuff
How do you feel about sheep
Dutch courage = getting drunk
Irish/French goodbye = leaving without saying anything
It's all Greek to me = I don't understand it
One that's stigmatised in my country but not most of Europe: Not wearing a uniform in school
Basically every school requires a uniform which always involves a shirt, trousers and black shoes
For primary school there's usually a solid coloured jumper, with red, green, blue and to a lesser extent purple and burgundy being common colours
In secondary schools the uniform is taken more seriously and generally involves, more or less, a full suit
Dress shirt, tie, blazer, black dress pants, black leather shoes (not trainers)
Small violations, such as wearing the tie too low/high or wearing the wrong kind of pants are taken unreasonably seriously
The dress code also extends to hair, with almost any dyed hair cut or even a crew cut being considered too extreme for school
Apparently most of Europe doesn't even have school uniforms, over here if your hair is a few cm too short in a state school or they consider your style unprofessional, expect to go back home until it grows out
In some countries you're not allowed to cross a clear road unless the light is green or you're at a crossing
Here you just cross when you deem it safe and it's perfectly legal
Anti-gypsy comments are still a common thing in Spain, too
Not on TV or publicly, but on the street a lot of people have negative opinions of them
It's not that it's not accepted in the UK, it's just not particularly popular
It's never really been part of our cuisine
Horses are/were primarily beasts of burden, entertainment or transportation
Now, Cows, pigs, sheep, goats, even pigeons, that's a different story
Still very common in the UK in areas with high gypsy populations too
Nah you can ask questions in lectures here
Plenty of people do it
It depends on the lecturer and maybe the university but mostly its on the actual lecturer themselves and if you can't its because of time schedules and making sure the lectures don't run over
It's an uncommon item in what appears to be a very low magic campaign
Totally worth it
Nah its not forbidden food people still often eat rabbit stew
Well, I always get the feeling its more of a countryside thing than a city thing where rabbits are still hunted etc and we aren't so squeamish about the death of them
I have to admit I do find it a little upsetting but it didn't stop me from eating it
I would rather have a shorter lunch and finish work quicker to be honest
Why are asians bringing in salt lol
Good point
Things like chasing cheese down hills are pretty strange
Maypole dancing is ridiculous
Morris dancing
Not the dancing specifically, but the outfits and hats and bells on the knees
Photos of this are super popular on gay porn blogs, as you can imagine
It’s... it’s like god’s gift to the gays
Now that's the real Turkish Delight right there
But this needs to become a global sport asap
I hope the Olympics are watching cuz they just found a new sport to add imo
I'd be down for some Turkish oil wrestling, sign me up
Its awesome no lie
Its right up my alley
Might I ask what sketch
Its the true, real Turkish Delight
Jack the Ripper
Famous *because* he was a bad person
Otherwise probably would have just been a normal doctor
Depends on who you ask
Only the top 10 in that list was actually voted on by the public, do he came last in that terms
The list also has Guy Fawkes listed as a great Briton yet his failure, capture and death is celebrated every year
Chased those Normans down that bastard hill
Perfidious
France
And I juuuust realised where Nova Scotia gets its name from
Cool
Debatable
Have you ever been to East Anglia
They're kind of similar cities
I thought the British had ended impressment before the war had even started (of course with communication being what it was there was no way America could've known)
I love FE-Schrift
To be fair, I love everything German… (except some of their history between 1911-1914 and 1939-1945
I’ve always said, it’s the only other country I could happily live in
The Belgian plates are definitely not anywhere near the best
The old UK ones look good though
I love how Southern European countries always have loads of cute little reptiles scampering about
Shutters on windows
Going out for a drink and having one drink (almost everywhere means I exclude the Republic of Ireland from this)
If you get out and about you can still find plenty of reptiles in the summer in England
I fucking love British food
I saw a lizard in my garden once
It was the weirdest shit because you never see them here also don’t talk shit about the wood pigeons
Yeah, I know we have a few, but like you said, we don't just casually see them out and about
>Seriously tho, why
Doesn't it bother you that people can see inside of your house
Or you in private
Most people who were rich or middle class historically had a big hedge or wall for that outside their front garden
I think the reason is that people don't want to have to go outside and close them when it's raining
My mother has this inner curtain thing, so she has two curtains in her front room, a thick outer one and a thin inner one, it's called a double curtain, a lot of people use it in place of shutters so people can't see in
Looks like this  [
Agreed, I think countries with shutters only tend to have net curtains, whereas most curtains in the UK are thick and opaque
I've never witnessed anything similar, that doesn't sound like typical behaviour to me
We do have thick curtains or blinds to block windows when we change/ at night, but you don't keep your shutters closed during the day, do you
If people have a window that is overlooked by other houses or the street, they tend to have net curtains for privacy during the day
I don't think the difference between thick blinds/curtains or shutters makes a difference to privacy, but I have no explanation for why this man was naked without his curtains closed, unless he didn't realise people could in
I see that way more than the slashed Z
I second this (although I think it's normally more like ʒ than a 3 - it's still a zig-zag at the start, just with a tail)
A family member has a Z in their name and whenever we get Christmas/birthday/etc
cards there are always a few ʒ's but I don't think I've ever seen one with a ƶ.
It’s very old fashioned but I had teachers at school that wrote it that way
If you google Victorian handwriting it seems the standard
I’d never associated it with the Cyrillic alphabet personally
That’s only my personal experience though, other British people in this thread seem to use the Z with a slash which I’ve never seen
I guess it varies depending on schools, industries you work in, etc
I think everyone except Sting has one
I'm the only one of five siblings who doesn't have a middle name
I thought OP was talking about surnames
Lots of people here don’t have middle names
Which family name do children take from their parents
Mixing sweet and savoury (eg bacon and maple syrup, chicken and waffles)
Just
I've noticed Canadian travellers in the UK tend to be festooned with maple leaves, presumably so they don't get mistaken for Yanks
We do it in the UK and I *hate* it
"How do you do
" is a traditional greeting, which you return with another "How do you do
I'm not making this up; it's madness
Liverpool played Sevilla in Boston yesterday and also against Dortmund in South Bend a few days ago whilst on their preseason tour of America
Before both matches they played the national anthem, haha
Really bizarre
Just to not go for something obvious in London I will mention the [Bloomberg Arcade] Its very much in the heart of the London financial district and rather that trying to be something completely different it leans into its corporate steel and brickwork and is just a cool place to walk around with [an interesting water feature] and of course [amazing views of much older architecture]
One of my favourites is the [Royal College of Physicians] next to the Regents Park in London
A classic example of Brutalism in the UK, and one that isn't as divisive as others such as the [National Theatre] (also a favourite of mine)
Indeed it is
I spent a lot of time at the Barbican whilst at uni in London
Such a cool place to explore
It's a marvel in my opinion
If it were to happen it would vindicate Brexit
No thanks, but we are leaving anyway so I don't really care
This is one of the reasons we voted Leave though, people in the UK are very uncomfortable with any further union
I suppose so
Euro-federalists get their dream
Brexiteers are proved right and the political divide in our country is healed, allowing us to move on
Thing is though, even within remainers actual federalists are a minority
Remainers basically wanted to keep the status quo
Almost none of them would ever want to join the euro, join an EU military or become a member of a 'united states of Europe'. In fact, they were things they said would never happen
So if the EU were to actually go in that direction then they wouldn't really have an argument anymore
The EU they wanted to remain in wouldn't exist anymore
But in this hypothetical the EU the Brexiteers want to leave will exist
That's all I'm saying
No, I don’t think I really learnt anything about Finland at School
Didn't even know about Finland till I started doing my own personal historical research about the world
What kind of school did you go to
The history curriculum is focused on world history, local history, and national history
Eh, no we don't.  The history curriculum framework is is focused on ***world history***, national history, and local history
Used to be similar here
But our curriculum changed in 2013 and now in geography it's all about countries, cities, etc
It wasn't like that for a while though, when I was at school in the early 2000s it wasn't.
For some reason the old geography curriculum went alone the lines of climate/ weather/ water cycles/ rivers/ mountains/ earthquakes/ volcanoes etc
That sort of stuff only
That's not the current history curriculum framework though
And most countries tend to teach history that is more relevant to them
I did The Romans (national but also world history), Ancient Egyptians, Tudors, Stuarts, WW1/WW2, Anglo Saxons, Normans, Industrial Revolution, Victorians, etc
Certainly did do world history topics
Now at school people learn about Chinese/African history topics and more ancient world civilizations like Ancient China, Indus Valley, Maya civilization, The Aztecs, etc
Just to name a few
Big Ben,
London Eye,
Blackpool Tower,
The Gherkin (Mary Axe),
St pancras hotel and train station,
The Shard,
Tower Bridge,
Houses of Parliament,
Seconded on Lincoln Cathedral
Wonderful structure
And your right, it was the tallest building in the world, between 1311 and 1548
I recall being a bit underwhelmed by it if I’m being brutally honest
Still, the first twisted skyscraper
Historical importance
I mean when you consider that they dragged them all the way across from Wales and over the Bristol Channel it genuinely is
Not many know about fountains abbey to be honest its quite hidden in the Yorkshire Dales, i dont live too far from it
But if you really explore England you will find so many ruined abbeys
>  I know y'all have history coming out every orifice there, but it's weird to be in a place that was in operation longer than the US has been a country
We used to have a lot more
There's the ruins of the stables of a grand manor quite near to me, boarded up and left to rot
Around 2,000 significant country houses have been lost in England alone, mostly in the 1900s.
It _was_ the world’s tallest building
Big ben is the name that's used, everyone just calls it Big ben
My family never really goes on big abroad holidays we just explore the UK, but theres loads of 18th, 19th century mansions
(I only like them because theres almost always an old piano i can play) but you can just walk around the grounds of the mansions and just explore
Most of them are owned by national trust
My school was older than the US
Speaking as a recruitment consultant and former estate agent, I’d say recruitment consultants and estate agents
Bouncers (Nightclub /Bar security) in major cities like London, Bristol etc, tend to be very sexist and kinda racist towards certain ethnic groups getting into clubs etc
Bouncers in smaller cities and towns are normally fine, in Portsmouth at least they are, even been joined for a drink by them a couple of times, but to be fair I only go drinking with my mates, and we are all white blokes from Portsmouth , so are the customers they are most likely to get along with, because bouncers in this kind of city are just local fat blokes in black tshirts
I would imagine maybe foreigners or people from an ethnic minority would have a worse experience with the Portsmouth bouncers than I do though
They generally are a lot less formal than in London or a major city
Can I ask if you’re happy in your current role
(Joke - please don’t hit me
Same in the UK, they have inspectors here too, but they have no legal right to actually enter your home, so you can just ignore them if you want
Most people do pay it, but a lot of young people don't pay it because they only watch TV on their computer etc, so there's no way to prove anything
Its like £140, I'm not paying that, its insane
I mean tbf the BBC doesn't have any adverts, but it does definitely have some issues of political bias (it favours centrists from any political party heavily)
I’m embarrassed for my fellow recruiters
You can definitely be biased towards the centre and the establishment
The BBC is very hostile to both people on the left like Corbyn and to the more right wing Conservatives like Jacob Rees-Mogg, they provide big coverage to many has-been centrist politicians to bash them in both parties such as Ken Clarke and various former Blair cabinet ministers
I think there's difference between being actively neutral, and actively supporting the establishment centrists in both parties
IIRC there was a local boy who went missing at a similar time and didn't get anywhere near the same publicity
Like others have said the fact it was a middle class family, and also the fact it was a girl
Generally girls get the most attention, then boys, then women, then men
I think the parents were fairly well connected, so they were able to keep up support for the search
In fairness black pete is kinda messed up
I remember that, it really did piss me off
Nothing much you can do about this sort of thing either because at the end of the day people will care about what they care about, there isn't much we can do to make a population care about something they don't want to
Newspapers largely just push the stories they know will sell
Personally I think it’s messed up whatever way you look at it
Cleared my diary, and switched off my phone, to watch Trooping the Colour on BBC
I made someone a cup of tea after they had been through a serious crisis
Did maypole dancing, of course
>Ordering pasta at a Chinese restaurant in Germany (regretted it)
Why didn't you just have Chinese food
underappreciated comment
If there's one thing I've noticed, it's that Spaniards love Newquay
Honorary Brit
Oh I understand
I pictured you walking into a restaurant that specialises in Chinese food and ordering a ragu bolognese haha
I think you might be referring to cockney
They speak with glottal stops so water becomes wa'er
icelandic, and by extension, really any nordic language (except danish), in fact fuck it, **all** germanic languages are really easy on the ear
spanish is a world of fun to pronounce, though
Icelandic, Estonian, Italian, Mandarin, Kazakh, Yakut,
I love Irish and Scottish Gaelic
could listen to them all day
Shame the orthography of each are so odd-looking
It used to be French but as I've gotten older I've come to appreciate German, I'm not sure what accent it is but that softer and slightly higher tempo German sounds great
Just because it is in many ways considered the ‘default’ so it gets ignored : (
Well, it sounds completely different depending on where the speaker is from
you probably have the best looking and sounding language in europe if not the world
Nah there are some lovely American accents
What people perhaps don’t enjoy is the volume
~~spit the potatoes out and speak norwegian~~
i totally agree
i'm awful at pronouncing foreign languages but i've been told my spanish pronunciation is really good
that's not to brag though — it is *really* easy
but so many people in my spanish class struggle over even rudimentary vocabulary
i think the most difficult sounds are /r/ as in perro and /ɾ/ as in pero
i think about 50% of people are incapable of alveolar taps or flaps, statistically
what i meant was north germanic
i know that, i wasn't including finnish in what i originally said
i was specifically referring to north germanic languages bar danish
Oh boy, we certainly get a lot of hate and insults
I don't like people who hate on other countries
We're all the same really
I don’t like the stereotype of Americans being ignorant/stupid/insular
It’s easy as someone from a smallish, cosmopolitan European country to take the piss out of rednecks, but there are completely legitimate geographic and economic reasons for big swathes of the US being isolated and unsophisticated
It feels very much like punching down
Just because the US as a country is powerful, that doesn’t mean it’s suddenly ok to be snobby towards their poor people
With ridicule happy for anything original aimed at anyone
Most insults however usually reflect badly on the originator, since they are rooted in ignorance, prejudice and are based on petty tribal views we should have left behind 200 years ago, when even then they were probably inaccurate
Because nobody else has said it yet, Wales: "haha, they fuck sheep, heh, they speak nonsense". People like that can fuck off
~~I *might* just be a Welsh-aboo or something though, idk
The "France is full of cowards" thing is both annoying and simply wrong
You try defending your country when 2/3 of your army has been encircled and destroyed
Also getting real tired of the spooky no-go zone myths about Sweden
yeah leave us alone, especially brexit jokes are becoming totally excessive because they are usually unrelentingly pro-EU and have absolutely zero thought put into them other than 'leave EU = nothing good happen again', also jokes about our colonial history, as well as the concept of having a politically irrelevant monarch being somehow an invariable threat to our personal freedoms
also stop insulting/downplaying europe as a whole and stop referring to it like a country
Never heard any of those
I would agree with this
Over the last 10-15 years I’ve meet and got to know loads of Polish people who’ve moved over to the UK
In the main they are some of the nicest, hardest working and fun people I’ve met
I love the Poles and also feel very defensive when people talk them down
If anything, jokes about Vietnam tend to paint them in a positive light at the USA's expense, surely
I've never heard that they're drunks
I'm surprised anyone cares
We seem to be easy targets
All you have to do is call us idiots or evil or racist and everyone agrees and laughs
I'll try
The Black Sea coast is owned by the Russians
Any car with 3 digits in a row e.g 333, 888 etc
is a mafia car
Actually that's all I know (negatively) about Bulgaria, except for you siding with the Nazis in WW2 (which is unfortunately true but hey-ho, that's history for you)
Edit: Oh, and your government ia one of the most (obviously) corrupt in Europe
But that's unfortunately true and not something to joke about
It's a real problem that fucks over most Bulgarians
Damned Italians, they ruined Italy
Everyone knows that the Etruscans are the true Italians
We do that here too lol, typically middle age woman use it but more defo could
If someone’s having a gossip they’d go ‘your julies been up to something, my Sharon heard about it from Jim’s Beth’
I’ve got to say it’s getting a lot better recently; they actually give you tips for each lesson now and if you get a common error it points out where you went wrong and the rules around it, whereas before it was extremely difficult to find out the rules and grammar of a language without actually learning it in school
I know the monarchy is quite popular here, but I'm inclined to agree
I don't think we should get rid of the Queen, but I think that ***if*** she dies, it would be a could time to abolish the monarchy
I think that its abolition is inevitable, and it's best to have it end on a good note, rather than a bad one
People buy six packs and off brand Jack Daniels in Iran like people buy weed over here lol
Not sure if this counts but I live near the Castle where the Nine Days Queen was executed
There’s also a myth about the castle where during the English civil war, a pregnant woman and her army general husband were hiding
The opposing side eventually lay siege and her husband died and she had a miscarriage
Her only will was to be buried with her husband and child but obviously that couldn’t be arranged due to war
Now her ghost apparently wonders the church close to my home, forever looking for her child
Third and finally, apparently a father murdered his daughter in a dilapidated house on castle grounds
There have been sightings of ghosts where an actress for a castle tour went on lunch break but her colleagues claimed she stuck around
The
Purple Aki
He is a 6 ft 5 in tall bodybuilder who stalks young lads and demands to feel/measure their muscles
He was banned from touching people's muscles by a Liverpool Court
The famous cottingley fairies were photographed just up the road
Never been, but my mums from there
Didn't have much to say about it
I found that strange too
Seems like a good idea to me
Sounds quite environmentally friendly to focus on cooling yourself directly rather than the whole room with AC
Also think they can look nice
I don’t think this is just a German thing, 100% do this in UK too
Though some appliances could be left, it depends if there are furnishings agreed in the sale too
Also if the appliance was built-in then that would likely stay
Thank god, I thought it was just me and my friends being weird
I'm surprised it isn't the norm everywhere, I'm surprised at how a host is expected to provide alcohol for every guest at a party seems like a lot of money to fork out
Sounds like the bumps
You hold the birthday person up by the arms and legs and lift them up and down, once for every year
It's not something that happens anymore, but people my parents age used to do it
I find the one that we’re all ugly pretty funny
It’s pretty ridiculous to paint a whole country as ugly
But then sometimes I come back from a holiday on the continent, look around at us and think, fuck me, we are a sorry looking bunch
A greek person once told me that their stereotype of British people is that all the women are ugly and all the men are gay
Have to say that's definitely my favourite
That we need licenses to buy butter knifes and people get arrested and chucked in jail for not having one
I hate the stereotype that our food is bad
I don’t care if people disagree with me; if you can’t enjoy a beautifully prepared roast dinner, or a full English breakfast, or proper chip shop chips, or a nice buttery crumpet, or a lovely strawberry trifle, or even just beans on toast (with a little cheddar on top), I feel sorry for you
One that I find amusing
that all English men are gay
Old-fashioned at this point but still there
It’s funny because I actually am gay, and if all English men were gay as well, I’d be in heaven
I’d never leave this island again
Finally you confessed
I've heard speaking Spanish as a tourist in Portugal is a big no no
Is it common for tourists to think you guys speak Spanish or as you say actually part of Spain
I've only ever seen the teeth thing from Americans, it's pretty much their go to when insulting us
Similar to how we apparently all stab each other and have an acid attack problem because we don't have guns
>Leprechauns don't exist
Wait what
How
What has it got to be the US
its the UK that has the stereotype not the US
Oh I totally agree
To be so unaware of the rest of the world and not even bother to check the language when travelling somewhere is disrespectful
No, you started it when you shagged all those sheep
10-12 degrees without wind is perfectly fine for tshirt and shorts if you stay at least mildly active
16-17 degrees if you are stationary or if it is windy
Yorkshire lass here
If I won't be frostbitten within 10 seconds of leaving the house, the jacket stays in the cupboard
Since moving to London, I've been shocked at how soft the southerners are, and even more shocked at how incredibly, crazily delicate people from the continent are
I've become very close friends with an Italian lady and she NEVER leaves her flat without a jacket
Bonkers
Begins with B.
Ends in it
Rhymes slightly with bad shit

I was in Lille a couple of years ago and it was scorching - 30+ degrees anyway which is scorching to me - and those poor soldiers patrolling in full kit
I'd have offered to buy them an oce cream but I doubt they could have accepted
It used to be Churchill but we're not allowed to say he's a hero anymore
Probably Shakespeare, the Duke of Wellington, Admiral Nelson, Alfred
Horatio Nelson
We even named the main square in London after his achievements
Charles II
Here is a lesser known person who perhaps should be mentioned in this category: William Wilberforce, he was a leading figure in the abolition of slavery debate
Great grandfather was a sergeant in the grenadier guards at the Somme and Paschendale
The imperial war museum have the original copy of a poem he wrote whilst in the tenches of the Somme
WWI & WWII (great grandfather lied about his age for WWI which was common back then because of the propaganda)
Lol whoops
Far as I know, never
Our first prime minister built a hilarious room in his manor that was Roman themed and included a bust of himself in the style of a Roman senator though
Having doors in bathrooms that don’t leave enormous gaps when closed
Every time I go to the US I’m just baffled that people tolerate this
Do you want people looking at you while you shit
So crazy to me
whatsapp
It's only popular in the UK but cricket is pretty much the perfect American sport
It's slow, boring, not much happens, full of natural breaks for advertisements, massively statistical and perfect for the hot and dry weather in a lot of the US
Isn't this more of a southern european thing
You guys need to start an anti-gap campaign
It's all a lot dryer than the UK though, except the Pacific Northwest
Parking is used in English speaking countries
'do you know if there is parking
/ Where is the parking
' can all be interchanged with car park
It's it used in British English
Like ring master
Any fucking airport rail link ever, in any country that I have been to
Actually, trains in general
You can get them reduced with a railcard (you have to buy long in advance), but it's a real shame in my opinion that our train companies have jacked up the prices by such an amount
We could do with fewer cars on the road anyway
Liesester Square to Cohvent Garden
Different exam boards
Why do you learn about the English civil war
That makes zero sense for a country in eastern Europe, but do you learn about Rome as my Romanian mate told me Rome had a massive effect on the Romanian country
How common are gender segregated schools in Ireland
I went to one here and, although they are a thing, they're certainly a minority of schools
I've never really seen it as a good or bad thing however, not inherently better or worse than mixed sex schools
Interesting how they're so common in Ireland
Also, looking through the [Wikipedia article on single-sex schools] I found this which was quite interesting:
> A major longitudinal study of over 17,000 individuals examined whether single-sex schooling made a difference for a wide range of outcomes, including academic attainment, earnings, marriage, childbearing and divorce
[27] The authors found that girls fared better in examinations at age 16 at single-sex schools, while boys achieved similar results at single-sex or co-educational schools
[28] Girls rated their abilities in maths and sciences higher if they went to a girls' school, and boys rated their abilities in English higher if they went to a boys' school, i.e. gender stereotyping was weaker in the single-sex sector
[29] Later in life, women who had been to single-sex schools went on to earn higher wages than women who had been to co-educational schools
[30]
I'm not trying to use this to prove any sort of point by the way, I just thought you might find it interesting
But we're talking culturally
Almost everything
I ordered some pate in a restaurant in Florence and what arrived was
an experience
Haggis is nice but I find it starts to get very heavy after a few bites
As a student this meal has saved me numerous times
When I've been working all day I need something cheap and easy
Beans and sausages on toast with grated cheese is fuckin immense
Hey, I had some decent desserts in the netherlands
And c’mon, everyone likes stroopwafels, right
I’ve only had it once, when I was a teenager still living in the Midlands of England
Dunno where we from it from
haha how French
love it
I dunno, I’ve been to a few pretty swanky restaurants that do specifically do high quality English/British
I was once lucky enough to go to one of Heston Blumenthal’s places that did modernised versions of medieval English cuisine
I ate pigeon
It was fucking delightful
Well, its quite unfortunate but the English flag, St George’s cross is kind of perceived as being a white Anglo-Saxon supremacist symbol
Often, if it wasnt for a sporting event, if you were seen in the street with an English flag, you would be thought of as far-right, nationalist and EDL/Britain First
(Im not a far-righter/right-wing by the way just because my flair flag is England lol)
It's used by the Scout Movement too
I think it's just a meme hardcore racists use to avoid having to use a nazi flag, because a Confederate flag is less well known, and a Nazi flag is seen as unbritish, so even most fascists and extreme right won't use it
Typically, if they were going to fly a flag, what people would fly in the UK, is either a Union flag or a national flag such as a Saint George's Cross
The St George's Cross in England generally either means a sporting event is on, like the World Cup, or the person flying it is quite right wing (but not necessarily extreme)

definitely no country has historical grievances with Britain
I’m sure
can we move on
next question
plz
> Additionally as far as I know no British representative has ever even acknowledged that Britain ever did anything bad to/in Ireland in the past, much less apologised or tried to "settle" the past,
You've probably never looked because they definitely have
Example here:
You wouldn't though, would you
A minority of Welsh people actually want independence
Seems like Spain would be better off focusing on countries like Ireland and Luxembourg who's tax practices siphon vastly more money from the Spanish economy than Gibraltar
That and the fact that most English people today are not bloodthirsty ireland-hating pillagers
Most
> I think one of the greatest tragedies of ireland is also the way the english turned the forests (which remnants are still divinely magical) into sheep pastures
Ireland was already at 12% forest cover by the end of the 16th century
Its a myth that the British or English destroyed all the forests in Ireland
If I were wales I’d take it
>be English
>some old people who happen to share your nationality decide to move somewhere
>get blamed for other people's retirement choices and get called a dirty oppressor for it
Such is life
Ahh, yes, the over 65 brigade that we send in to swing Elections our way
Makes a lot of sense
I'd expect them to put more focus on the most detrimental ones
But they don't because the issue has nothing to do with Gibraltar's tax practices but instead is about Spanish pride, jingoism and nationalism
Gibraltar gets warships in its shore, what do the others get
You actually do recognise Gibraltar as part of the UK, you just don't recognise it as an overseas territory and therefore are unwilling to sign a mutual agreement with the Gibraltarian government
The place wouldn't be useful to the Spanish government if you did, I imagine
Don’t I fucking know it
5% max
The vast majority of Irish deforestation was self-inflicted like every other country
Be english
Be born in a country with an antagonistic relationship with many other countries
Be blamed for
everything
Such is life
Welsh people and Scottish also did a lot of fucked up shit to Ireland so it's also unfortunate that "English" is the teem used to describe stuff that British people did on the whole
My favourite one is being blamed for creating Israel
I think you'd have to be pretty foolish to think the Spanish reaction/position has anything to do with decolonisation considering they have outposts they hold onto that border Morocco
Its all about pride and nationalism
Because they were Catholics basically
If you want go that route: India was British before India existed
Case in point, Ceuta and Melilla are both much older than Spain
Anyways, I'm not criticising Spain for holding on to them, its just hypocritcal for them to point at Gibraltar as a colonised land and demand decolonisation and the transfer of sovereignty whilst they hold onto Ceuta and Melilla
True but most of Europe wasn't a part of the UK or the realm of a British monarch
At the time of the reformation being a catholic was tantamount to being seen as a traitor and agent of the pope
Passports are quite a modern invention and a British Indian passport did exist:  We actually only ever implemented immigration controls towards Commonwealth states in 1962 and previously they were legally allowed to migrate here and work as normal
Ignoring that, back to Gibraltar:
> The only thing special about those territories is they are not part of the iberian peninsula, as Canarias or Baleares
Its exactly the same as Gibraltar
Post 1949 and if they were resident in the UK, then yes
They still can
Its possible they would had been allowed to vote pre-1949 if they swore allegiance to the Crown too but I'm not confident in that
Graz is beautiful, lovely place
I have a friend in Bristol and I've never been; really must When All This Is Over
IMO its not really a shame
I grew up quite literally 2mins walk from the suspension bridge and am very much a Bristolian
In recent years the suspension bridge become part of some sort of 'west country tourist route' and great big coaches full of tourists queue up in the area unload tourists for a photo and then pile them all back on to go off to stonehenge or bath or something
Like, I dont see how its 'a shame' us not having more that sort of thing
It offers nothing to us
Bristol is a wealthy city and doesnt need an income from tourism, nor does it have the roads or public transport to be dealing with any number of tourists
Isn’t there also Eindhoven
Although to be fair I only know that place exists because Ryanair flys there
I think most people know about Lucerne as well
In Sheffield we're twinned with Bochum, and have a long strip of road called 'Bochum parkway'
Extra fun fact, the word of Bairn comes from the Norse settlers word for child, which in Swedish today (probably Norwegian and Danish for that matter) is Barn
Deeper than you'd realise, culturally we're so similar
Late 2019 I travelled round Asia with 2 Germans and a Norwegian, without us speaking you'd have thought we were all from the same country
Average quality of food is bad here
Now that doesn't mean our cuisine is bad
When done well a lot of our food is delicious
It's just that compared to other places we don't have a very good food culture
There are a lot of restaurants that would go out of business in other countries but we have lower standards so they stay afloat
Yeah, we might have a lot of good Michelin starred places but going out for cheap to mid-range food is really hit and miss
As well as this a lot of people have non-existent cooking skills
Growing up it seemed that my mum, as much as I love her, didn't know that food should be seasoned with salt or that there was another way to have vegetables than steamed to mush
We're far more right wing than our immediate neighbours and we're dragging them down with us
> Sadly
Yep true
You mean like Scotland who legalised homosexuality 30 years after England
Not really though
>Implying being right wing is a bad thing
What are YOU doing here
Well of course there are exceptions
And to be fair that was a long time ago
I’m talking about present day
I mean yeah though
Yeah
I would hardly say FAR more
Maybe a bit more
I would say far more
This is why the uk Supreme Court which we only set up last decade can be so important - as seen in the pro-roguing controversy last year
It’s good to have an authority who can adjudicate which possible law takes precedent constitutionally
That would be *squirrel*, which is pronounced /ˈskwɪɹəl/. Not sure about non-native speakers but Americans seem to have some trouble :)
Nothing interested here but my mum pronounces squirrel like sqarrel
Haha
Out of curiosity, what part is it that you find difficult about it, what trips you up
Is it the /skw-/ (are other words like *square* and *squeeze* difficult too)
Is it the proximity of the /w/ and the /ɹ/ so they get mixed up
I think I might do that myself from time to time and end up accidently saying 'scrirrel' :)
Ah I get you
I'm the same in French with your R. Like, I can do it, but in certain words it sure does trip me up
Are you referring to the different ways of pronouncing it
Like voiced [ʁ] vs voiceless [χ] allophones
Or the older trill pronunciations [ʀ] and [r]
Since I'm pretty sure there's only one r phoneme in French
Ah got you
Again I can pronounce both but I do have to concentrate sometimes
Pronouncing a word in isolation: fine, actual conversation: all goes out the window haha
I think I have a bit of a tendancy to use the voiceless [χ] by default when speaking for some reason even when I shouldn't, if I'm not being careful
In fact it sometimes ends up being a voiceless trill [ʀ̥] instead
Haha cheers :) I hope so but I don't practise my French nearly enough
Come to think of it, maybe I should make use of the extra time I've got with the lockdown and focus on it a bit
Maybe I'll see some progress haha
Like my grandma used to say
“Shelf in the shop
Fridge in the home”
Golly, she loved eggs
Killed her in the end
Same, big wooden bowl
We probably get through three dozen or more per week, so it's handy to have them handy
Conversely, I've never seen anyone keep them in the fridge
Yeah, for like 6-12
Our family can easily get through three dozen a week
Not the person you replied to, but lots of Asian soups feature egg
Milk or water in first when making a cup of tea
Silly and useless argument because water in first is objectively correct
scones - on *two* fronts
one, pronunciation: scon or scoan
two, preparation: jam first, cream second (cornish way), or cream first, jam second (devonian way)
(the correct answer: scons are made jam first)
wtf is a ‘soft k’? How do you make ‘k’ soft
I like Czechia, but it’s not my decision to make
Supper
I’m from the midlands and tend to use both for some reason
Not gonna lie, but this is basically me with British English vs American English
So I can totally understand why
I can't believe you've done this
Well the sugar first if you take it
Otherwise it'll get all over the teabag and hinder the infusion process
Yeah of course
We're not savages
I wish it was just a meme
You should get a brew made by my missus
I've tried to teach her
My dad does
He used to lecture me on how I was wrong when I put the milk in first
I should have called childline
Frauds, the lot of them
Are you fucking serious
To be fair, our tea is very strong black tea that can be very bitter without a dash of milk
It's not like we're putting it in fruity teas that lots of other nations have
Jesus Christ, why am I so pathetic that the idea of microwaving water made me angry
Nope just a dash of cold milk at the end
No, that way it helps cool the tea a bit
can we claim Mr Brightside
please
i know it's an American song but it feels like such a big part of British culture at this point
I think for England though it's probably a couple of the big Oasis songs, guaranteed to get the whole pub singing along
Ah dude 500 miles is deffo on that list above
Having been Interrailing twice, once in 2018 and once in 2019, for 2 weeks each, there is no distance which would be too far for me to travel by train
In 2018 for example we left our house in the north of England and travelled round Europe for 2 weeks
Think it was England - Bruges - Berlin - Prague - Krakow - Vienna - Venice - Rome (+ a visit to Pompeii) - Paris - back to England
All on train, not a single flight involved
The furthest distance there would be Pompeii at 1495 miles from my house
I must also add that, even though I’ve been on around 25 flights in my life, including to Australia and back, I developed a fear of flying around 7 years ago and will now only get on a plane if absolutely necessary
The new Charlie and the Chocolate movies
Hearing that little British kid call a plaster a ‘band aid’ _physically hurt_.
Btw our go to exclamation in response to an American freaking out hasn’t been “Don’t get your knickers in a twist” for about 4 decades and to be honest it wasn’t really that common to begin with
I also love in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves when Kevin Costner and Christian Slater barely even attempted English accents, let alone East Midlands or Nottinghamshire accents
Just a couple of modern American dudes hanging out in Sherwood
Also, About Time is a cutesy, quirky British rom com and whatnot but you have to understand - the people in that film are rich
They are very wealthy
They represent the top, like, 10% of the population _if that_. They have a fucking tennis court in amongst ruins for christ sake
And they acted like him sharing a home with a _fucking playwright_ was him slumming it through uni
hilarious
It’s a delightful cinematic metaphor isn’t it
Hah
bingo
I haven't ridden a bike in years
I'm not quite sure when I learnt but I was never the strongest at it
I reckon I would be pretty wobbly at first if I got on one now, being completly out of practice
I learnt to ride a bike about 5-6
When I was 3 or 4
One of my earliest memories is actually of looking back towards my step sister when I was learning, riding into a kerb and falling off
It's not
It's because we call you frogs and so you call us what we eat
Roast beef
You sound like my very right-wing English father
“Overall Bloody Sunday was considered a victory for the IRA, as Collins's operation severely damaged British intelligence, while the later reprisals did no real harm to the guerrillas but increased support for the IRA at home and abroad
Bit of background
Why do you say English instead of British
I mean
offense
Come out and fight me like a man
; ) no worries
oi watch your language
But in terms of British military presence in Ireland there was no difference
You’ve actually had [three]
I think people get a bit over excited about it if I'm honest
WW2 is a fascinating saga in history, but European countries have a couple of thousand years of national history to cover
People often complain here that "we don't learn about this event or that event"....Britain has a very big history
English nationalists and Brexiteers love to talk about the Battle of Britain, the 'Blitz Spirit' and standing up to Hitler alone as if they have some equivalence to Brexit, dealing with the economic fallout and standing up to the EU
Definitely the british empire, which actually is quite weird because of how many atrocities it had committed
What do Greeks think of the whole Megali Idea these days
A major misunderstanding of the 100 years war is that it was England vs France
It was much more a dynasty war, and if 'England' had won, it would have been the junior partner in a union with France
All English Kings in that period lived in the French territories
They saw themselves as French
So in a way, it was an English victory, as the loss meant the English weren't vassals to the French King anymore
Try telling them that
Game is super traditional British food but its not actually that common
You'll find it in most traditional gastro pubs especially if they're in the countryside but its not that common in home cooking
Goose is sometimes the bird of choice over turkey at Christmas
Pigeon and other game birds are very common among the rural population
Wood pigeon have meat to die for
I was lucky enough to go to one of Heston Blumenthal’s restaurants once that was themed around medieval English cuisine
I had pigeon there and it was fucking immense
That said, the only time I eat poultry other than chicken these days is duck in Asian dishes or turkey at Christmas
Not sure how accurate this is but I view duck as a staple of French cuisine
Is it super common to eat in France
Remember there are different breeds of pigeon, when one eats pigeon its not the sort you find eating out of a bin in the middle of a city
Pigeons that you eat look a bit more [like this]
That's not a dove
It's a king pigeon
Looks like some nondescript town in the American midwest
Yeah it happened to me when I went to university
Apparently the way I pronounce my 'ar's in words like garden and car is weird
Had people properly dying of laughter at the pub every time I said the word garden
I didn't think I had a strong accent but sometimes people form London can be a bit sheltered to regional accents
Yes, I'm from barnsley (close to Sheffield)
We get this because we miss out loads of letters in words, and have a wired accent compared to the rest of the area
Sorry bruv I can’t speak irn bru
Do you speak Breton Gaelic
Where in Ireland are you from
Carlow or Cavan then
It's the same in England yeah
I've a mate from Donegal that told me his wife's Dublin family struggle with his accent
Cork accents are the strangest Irish accents to me
I think they sound more like Welsh accents than other Irish ones
I went in January 2016 when I was 17 with my dad and sister
The skyscrapers were huge, the architecture was beautiful, and everything was fantastic
We stayed near Times Square so we went there everyday and it never got old
Times Square at night and early morning (around 8am) was something else, the lights at night and quietness in the morning, it was beautiful
What we found crazy was crossing the roads
Just cars being over the crossing every now and then was something to get used to - it’s generally not a thing that happens in the UK
We didn’t travel on the subway as we didn’t feel the need to - we just walked everywhere
We do wish that we got a bus pass though to see Ground Zero and other things further away from us
We went to Madame Tussauds, the Natural History Museum, Intrepid, Museum of Modern Art, Central Park, the Empire State Building and other stuff
The Natural History Museum was bigger than we thought, we spent the majority of the opening hours the day before we left, and felt like we needed more time as we didn’t get to see everything
It was massive
Also, I took $500 and came back with $12 lol
It’s not cheap haha
I do want to go there again, hopefully within the next few years I’ll get the chance and money to go
It’s breathtaking
So beautiful and grand
Never been to a city that towers over you like that
London is beautiful, but the skyscrapers we have here are less numerous and usually a lot shorter
I got to see the Seagram Building in real life, having wrote about it and its designer, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, in essays during my time at university
Getting to just walk around and admire the beautiful architecture was genuinely one of my favourite parts of the trip
Shoot need to go to NYC to answer this question
I'll be back in 50 hours
You know Turkey has made a huge comeback in tourism and ranked 8th worldwide which is really cool
All those positive comments just to see a 7
5/10 lol
> alot of weird people,
Are you talking about how busy people are
It’s logical but less romantic
I like how you can get a bit lost in European cities
But friends with benefits literally means fuck buddies
Like theres nothing innocent about it accept the lack of swearing
Yeah, the damn sun set last night, angry af
Don't worry about it too much
I got punched in the face by a British guy in Britain
Possibly for a fellow Brit
We sure are a contentious people
I have a Polish girlfriend who has introduced me to disco polo and have to say (unironically) that I like it, and am particularly a fan of some of the songs by Skaner, Boys and Akcent
Sadly I have been less successful in my attempts to reciprocate with getting her into my favourite genre (drum and bass)
Many Australians and Canadians also used to refer to England as the motherland, not many do anymore though
Typically it was because of their own struggles, now we aren’t the world superpower I don’t think they could care less, I’d take it as a compliment honestly
Russia being called the motherland is pretty fucking badass though
Mother Russia is something I’d wear on my sleeve and wear with pride
Nah, a lot of Aussies don’t even like the Queen
The most common insult in Australia which every Aussie will say to a Brit is ‘Pom’ derived from the word ‘Pome’ (prisoner of mother England), because most Aussies originate from England
I've never seen them like that in my life
I’ve seen them in school but they arent that common here I’ve never had one is my house
Nobody has those windows in the UK
Certainly they are extremely uncommon, ive never seen them or know anyone who has them, theyre not a thing here anyhow
In the uk we either have old style Georgian windows(which open straight up) or more modern windows(which are the kind which open sideways but outwards) etc
Sort of thing you’d get in apartments/offices/schools built after 2000
We don’t tend to have them on houses because they look unattractive on Victorian houses

Exurb1a’s content is really enjoyable, quite philosophical, but funny at the same time
I believe he also writes books
Edit: turns out he is/was/will be in court for a rape, that’s changed my opinion a bit
Obviously England, not sure where, it’s hard to pinpoint
I don’t get what you mean by connecting the words, doesn’t seem different to any other accent, I could be wrong though
Surely from the south east though, don’t beat me up if I’m wrong
Those are all shit tbh
Ikr
I love his channel but i don’t know if I can see him the same from now, guess innocent till proven guilty
I guess why I couldn’t see anything weird about it is because that’s how I speak aha, I’d say it like ‘kick-toff’ as well, for reference I live in Sussex, which is in the south east of England, we like to shorten our Ts, mostly at the end of a word (I know this doesn’t have a T), this is called a T-glottalisation
I guess it’s similar to that, it’s just easier to say ‘kick-toff’ because it reduces the time taken to say the word
I hope that made sense, it’s late and I feel like this won’t read well
I just find them really obnoxious and not funny and also that whole genre of video is really boring
I’m not sure, I’ll have a look
It’s ongoing in the Netherlands, not sure about the Bulgarian case
Yeah, it’s such a shame I used to always look forward to his uploads :( hope these allegations aren’t true
Probably 50-50 or *maybe* 60-40 in favour of dogs nationally
Personally I prefer cats
Less mess to clear up, low maintenance and if you get the right cat they can be almost as affectionate as dogs
I like both but in a dog man through and through and I believe the UK as a whole is a dog nation, we've created a large percentage of the current recognised breeds
Neither
I like dogs more but I’m not really much of an animal person in general
> Are you a cat or dog person
Both
> Which do you think your country prefers
Both
> Which do you think the continent prefers
Maybe cats
Yes, probably because they're low maintenance
I always make sure do to this with Bees
Why those furry little fellows enjoy the pavements of London so much i dont know
Depending on what definition of country you're using (United Kingdom vs England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland), Cornish, Welsh, Scots Gaelic and Gaelic
Umm, in the uk we have something called scouse
Yes
But that’s less dependant on the country I live in, and more the fact that I live in a small village
Only one bus comes through here and it goes to a nearby town and that’s it, obviously I have more places to go that just one town so yeah, a car is pretty important
I’m not sure if it is still a law but it was that any English man could kill a Scots man in York if he was holding a bow and arrow
Or something like that
It's known as [pannage] Apparently it's still done in some places such as the New Forest
My secondary school was built in the 18th century, so were two places I've worked in since then
My town was named in the Domesday book (1086), but nothing of import was really made or done there until the industrial Revolution
Jesus was it 400 years
That is a long time
Yeah I feel like 'Roman Britain' is spoken about so casually that you'd think it start and ended within a generation or 2
Yes the Eddas were Norse myths and tales written down by Icelandic authors, however they were written after Christianisation so they should be taken with a pinch of salt
That being said, the Eddas are much more reliable than many poeple give them credit for
Only was taught about the EU in Geography along with the EU member states
That's all
The EU was definitely not studied in any detail at my School, it may have been mentioned in PSHE (citizenship element), but honestly not even sure of that
Contactless
I don't know how much of a "thing" this is but as a child I remember being made to say "sausages" or "silly sausages" quite a bit
That's in addition to "cheese" which we use too
Most unique by far, haha
> When you meet someone from Northern Ireland, the unspoken rule is that you're not supposed to ask "Protestant or Catholic
"Actually, I'm Buddhist
"Aye, but are ye a *Protestant* Buddhist or a *Catholic* Buddhist
For the UK, generally, it's "so, what do you think about Brexit
Politics and religion
Never good conversation starters
> the unspoken rule is that you're not supposed to ask "Protestant or Catholic
I mean it'd be super weird to ask that to anyone no matter where they're from
Mate 90% of time abroad in the early 2000s seemed to just be men following me around shouting 'DAVIDE BEKHAM' at me

I’m proud of Wales, i know the feeling is not reciprocated but anytime I see stuff like this I’m always like this im aways proud of Wales
* Something like 40-50% of the entire Earth's cider market is exclusively made up of just the UK
* The UK by far consumes the most cider in the world too, to the point where it's not even close, the UK drinks about 820 million litres of cider a year
No other country on Earth gets anywhere near
It's the cider capital of the world, both in terms of production and consumption
I would cry because the beloved fish and chips would no longer exist
Export wheat from the Irish, duh
If France is ordering snails, the UK wants an opt out of the starter
>We would be in a nearby table with Northern Macedonia waiting for France and Netherlands to let us sit at the main table
The UK is going to force you to sit with Kosovo
Look, Buckfast (Monk-made fortified wine) is better than Trappist Monk beer, even Scotland agrees on that
We would then move you closer to Germany halfway through
We brought the finest English sparking wine,  Carling beer, roast beef, and chips topped with Cheddar cheese
What is wrong with you
Ffs France undercooked the meat again, and has brought French food, gonna need to get massively drunk and buy a Kebab from Turkey at 3am
England invented chips, Mayo does not go on chips, only salt, vinegar or Cheddar Cheese
PS Belgium: we can send you the Cadbury team to help you make better chocolate
Sorry, we have already invited our cousin from Belfast William Ulsterman, you'll have to spend all dinner arguing with him instead
Bad news, William Ulsterman won't sit next to Ireland, and is kicking off with France because they refuse to serve him Cheddar Cheese with Pineapple on a stick
Imagine thinking England would care what France thinks about food "fuck off France, you can't cook beef properly, everyone knows Cheddar is the best cheese in the world anyway, the only good French cheese is Brie and they can make that better in Somerset now
Would you like to calm down with a nice pint of Carling or Doom Bar
Pretty standard for the UK too
Fuck it, ordering a Kebab off Turkey anyway, not eating any of that gross foreign food from France
We will very kindly offer to share our English sparkling wine, Carling Beer, and Buckfast wine (Scotland will just drink all of that, and then smash the party up'
Would you like to buy some Lincolnshire sausage
It's the best in the world
Buckfast gets you fucked fast
It's probably the only wine with caffeine added into it, down a bottle or two of it and you are drunk all night and awake till 10am
Can't catch me, I've already flown out to Mallorca to get my towels on the sunbeds for my holiday in August before the Germans get there
The Opium Wars
Definitely the 100 years war or the wars with our neighbours we have
Instead we learn about a fat fuck with his 8 wives and some tune about it I've forgot right after I left school (that was like a few months ago, first year of college)
I feel like we leave a lot of important stuff out of history, but I don't feel like anything we learnt was pointless either
Unless we dedicate more time to learning history, I think important events are always going to be missed out
Yes, I had no idea they had even happened
Didn't learn about them till I saw a documentary as an adult
There's a lot of important stuff they miss out of history at school
Normally I'd say Kommissar Rex but I'm actually quite enjoying the new Canadian remake, even if it is a little more straight-faced
Edit: oh, but Camera Caffè was cool, I feel like we could do that idea well
I wish there was a british version of the office
Possibly with ricky Gervais
Sometimes yeah but also sometimes great films can be made
For Example The Departed is a great film and probably better than Infernal Affairs
Inbetweeners would be great or even shameless
I hope thats a joke
Depends on what sort of comedy you like
The comparison between the two shows really highlights [what Stephen Fry is saying here]
I've seen countless comments on /r/TIL that British accents used to sound American but we changed them as to not sound American
Or that everyone in the UK called it soccer, until it became popular in the US during the 90s, so we started using football as to not sound American
Utter bollocks on both accounts
Same with Birmingham in the UK, which Fox News declared a ‘no-go zone for non-Muslims’.
Speaking personally, there are plenty of reasons why I avoid Birmingham, but a de facto ban on non-muslims is not one of them
To be fair, the reaction in the UK was so intense that Fox had to issue an apology
> The KGB were scary and terrible but they weren't literally everywhere, listening on people through doors
Sure, but I guess the question is whether people *believed* they were
What idea is that
Someone was trying to tell me there were no go areas in London
I asked for actual locations, postcodes, a map etc
Silence
Somerset/West Country, it's one of the ones that's rhotic
people at the BBC and the hospitals he donated to knew what he was getting up to as well
Eh, I kinda think that one was expected
more of a maybe nah definitely nonce
Don't think so, or at least no one I knew went to them
Did know a few people who became camp counselors in America though, but they were just doing it as an excuse to get laid and have a holiday in America
No, although there are now summer play/activity schemes so you warehouse your kids during the day so you can go to work, which is what I assume summer camps are really for
My parents used to send us to our grandparents' place for half the summer holidays
Nah that's where american kids go to be bullied
They Def exist but you'd unlikely go on one for longer then a week or two
Once a year for a check-up, and I usually would have the hygienist on the same day
Usually a 1 time checkup followed by a hygienist appointment
Honestly tempted to just drop the checkup because the dentist never says anything the hygienist doesn't then just repeat
We learn about Poland in terms of the post WW2 era and the agreement between Churchill and Stalin on the borders in England when we are 15-16
What is definitely not taught in America is that the USSR did most of the actual fighting, if anyone they get most of the credit
US teachers also cover a lot more about the pacific, which was much more US dominated, covering it as an equal front to Europe, and seem to cover very little to nothing regarding the largely British led conflict in North Africa
it could be part to do with religion
Europe is lesser religious and more tolerant of gay folk etc
This appears to be incompatible with certain religious beliefs
Unfortunately there is a growing stigma associated with anybody having a middle eastern or African appearance wearing certain attire
You will find though that many folk will be accepting of you if you embrace the countries culture and adhere to their laws
Sooner you learn their language and make an effort to work in whichever country, you will find most people will open up to you and treat you just like everybody else
It's sad that the situation is like this but that is the reality sadly
London is a melting pot if international significance, but doesn't represent rUK at all, less than 50% of its pop is actual white English, whereas rUK is more like 90%+ except from certain areas in thr larger cities
Washing once a day is the norm
Twice maybe if there's some particular reason you're dirty or sweaty and you've already washed once that day
Some people wash less than once a day; IIRC my dad washes every other day, which isn't unheard of
But once a day is most common I think
I'm somewhat surprised how few people here say they take baths
I didn't think they were that unusual
Personally I alternate between having a shower one day and a bath the next
I just like the calming and relaxing aspect of it
Incidentally I also always wash in the evenings myself, whether bath or shower, though I think showering in the morning is also common
I generally shower once a day, sometimes I may not, or sometimes I will have two showers (if i’ve exercised usually)
Baths I’d have maybe once a month, I like long ones so I don’t have them too often
I shower pretty much every day
Might not always do it at the weekend unless I'm going somewhere in the evening
Our house does
We never used to but i was watching some food videos from Korea and they use scissors for everything and holy shit it makes everything so much easier
Anything that only needs a rough chop i use scissors for now
My parents had a pizza cutter, but my bf introduced me to cutting with scissors and that works great
I do and it's so much easier, I live in italy and I get some weird looks though
Perhaps it’s more effective/easier
With a cutter I find you have to roll it back and forth to actually cut through the pizza, whereas with scissors its much quicker and you have to apply less force
Answering your original question, I’ve heard of people in the UK use scissors to cut them, but not as many as those who use a pizza cutter (and if you are in a restaurant like Pizza Express you always get given a cutter to use)
Tough call - I want to jump to the obvious choices of Augustus/Trajan/Hadrian but I’m going to pick Claudius
He had spent his whole life being belittled as stupid/mentally challenged because of a speech defect (which is probably the reason he was kept alive tbh) and managed to pick up the complete shitshow that had been left to him by Caligula
Other favourites include Vespasian - for somehow stopping the empire from completely collapsing after the chaos of the third century
Marcus Aurelius - who gifted the world a huge amount of philosophical texts and was by all accounts a calm, collected and just ruler - never making rash decisions beyond choosing Commodus as a successor
Controversially - Julian
For giving paganism, and the attached rationality one last hurrah before being subsumed for 1100-1200 years in Europe by Theodosius’ banning of Polytheism
Big fan - his passing marked the death knell of the Roman Empire for me
The third century killed off a lot of lustre of Rome and the outlawing of Polytheism and the linked philosophical study truly transferred Rome from antiquity to medieval
I think Marcus Aurelius's reign is always going to be tainted by Commodus and the following Crisis of the Third Century . I think that is partly unfair because you can see the beginnings of Crisis during his reign, he was just a very competent emperor
I think its because the religion was in most of Europe brought in by aid of the sword
Most areas became majority Christian only after crusade or persecution
Whereas the various Polytheistic religions that were indigenous to Europe all had a lot in common and were largely tolerant of additional gods being admitted from outside influences
Generally speaking they were all descended from a common Proto-Indo-European religion
Be it Druidism/Norse Paganism/Hellenism
They gradually diverged as their root cultures did but all had similarities and you often saw local cults to Celtic/Germanic gods being added into the wider Roman Pantheon in frontier regions
On the other hand - the Abrahamic religions were not tolerant of other gods so synthesis could never occur
It was ‘believe in my god or you’re a devil worshipper’
Interestingly - the abrahamic religions are actually based off the old Semitic Polytheism
Whereas one old god became the true god - all the others became demons
On a side note - I think Scottish history only coincides with Christianity as it was the Goidelic speaking Scots who brought it over from Ireland around the 5th/6th century
The Picts who were already in Caledonia were thought to be Brythonic speaking - ie more like Welsh/Cornish than the Irish (unlike modern Scottish Gaelic)
Theodosius was one of the worst (of those that lasted years rather than months)
Finally outlawing Polytheism and the associating Rationalism
I live in England, in the UK, everyone looks down on every other country and region and county and town pretty much
Where I live
I just say to people I live in Ali-G town
Slough
It’s mainly just business estates, and is in general really boring
Well, I’m from Nottinghamshire, which has a pretty significant rivalry with the neighbouring county of Derbyshire
On account of a famous English folk song called “The Derby Ram”, the ram was long ago adopted as a symbol of the city (and the county more generally)
As a result, we in Nottinghamshire naturally began suggesting that Derbyshire’s love of sheep was indeed carnal, and that the denizens of Derbyshire actually fuck sheep
I grew up referring to Derbyshire people, and especially supporters of Derby County football club, as “sheep-shaggers”.
Meanwhile, the rest of the UK was using the same insult against the Welsh, based on their tradition of sheep-farming, a fact of which I only became aware in my teens
Even today when I hear the term “sheep-shagger” part of me thinks about Derbyshire, even though the rest of the country will immediately associate it only with Wales
And also because of what the city looks like
Its a very grey city
> Bielefeld does not exist
I've heard of this, heard of it a few years back after Angela Merkel mentioned it
Thought it was pretty funny
All industries in the UK tend to be clustered within London so it would be silly to create 50 different names for London so we don't.
For a while, our film industry was "Kenneth Branagh and friends"
The BBC
And in England there's Silicon Fen around Cambridge
Communists are right about plenty of things
People just forget
Partially because of its failings and partially because of anti soviet propaganda
It's a bit erratic in English (there's a surprise)
In general, we use "local" names, but it's a relatively recent switch, within the last century, so there are some historical people who we use anglicised or latinised names
Holy Roman Emperor Charles V isn't "Karl" or "Carlos" with his Spanish hat on
The chap who got shot in Sarajevo is Franz Ferdinand and the Emperor was Franz Josef, though you will still see older books and contemporary sources calling them Francis Ferdinand and Francis Joseph
Likewise, we tend to talk about Kaiser Wilhelm II rather than Emperor William II, but the latter shows up in older books and newspapers of the time
Russian tsars get anglicised pretty much all the time, it's Nicholas and Michael, not Nikolai and Mikhail *except* for Ivans, who don't become John
Possibly because "Ivan" has been adopted into English as a name in its own right
Birmingham and Liverpool are nowhere near as bad as people say they are
Belfast for sure
Been glamourised as some sectarian ghetto where murders are simply a daily occurrence by people who have never been there
City is brilliant
People are friendly
Yes even if you're English
Northern England
I don't think anyone overseas thinks that it is
Shoreditch etc is a major tourist attraction
I don't think any of those areas are really known outside of the uk, actually I don't even think people who live outside of London even know of them
no and yes
We bring in a bag of sweets or chocolate for the office when we come back from holiday
Usually from the place we’ve been, so baklava from Greece etc
I’m not sure how common it is as i’ve only come across it once so far
Also common here in more arty industries

There's a lot to choose from for UK music, but my current recommendation would be Royal Blood
They've a good mix of lighter and heavier stuff (sometimes the lighter stuff veers more into dance territory) and a very unique sound, as the guitar they use is actually a bass
The entirety of their 1st album, [Royal Blood] PLX1f6VBU1RGVYtz29ZlawG9N83wysKQZS) is very good and all rock, and although I haven't listened to a great deal of their newer stuff, I quite enjoy [Boilermaker] [Limbo] and [Lights Out]

oooo law graduate here and I have THE TEA
R V BROWN [1993]
So basically, there was this group of gay sadomasochistic men who had been prosecuted for GBH
The reasoning behind the charge was that they had been performing extremely harmful (albeit consensual) acts
The acts were so gruesome that it’s actually pretty difficult to find out the details, but apparently it included acts such as putting nails into their japs eyes (penis hole)
At the time, the question for the court was “to what level of harm can a person consent
” the House of Lords deemed that this level of harm you can’t consent to
There has been a lottt of controversy in this case though, as during the case they mention the need to “protect family values” in conjunction with the fact they were homosexual, and later cases with similar material facts but where the defendants were heterosexual were actually ruled in favour of the defendant
Consequently a lot of legal professionals take the view that the court at that time didn’t actually take issue with the level of harm so much as the fact they were gay
In my opinion if they were all consenting, let them do what they want
Various studies show that is social welfare that helps the poor and giving money to those who are begging usually end up in the hands of criminals
Carbolic is a good one
Important to note *history* not law books
I’m just giving famous court cases that we learn about in law school
Well it does say court cases, not historic punishments

India is planning on having one in the mid 2020s, weather that is a sure bet to happen or not I don't know
Im sure things have changed since i left school 14 years ago but I can remember;
Of Mice and Men
Macbeth
Romeo and Juliet
I think we also briefly did Othello
When I did my GCSEs (end of high school exams) we did Macbeth, An Inspector Calls, A Christmas Carol and War and Conflict Poetry
The school gets to choose what they do from 4 categories: Shakespeare, 19th Century Novel, Modern Prose or Drama, and Poetry
The exam makers have a list of the Texts allowed to be picked in those categories
Before GCSEs we read alsorts which would be mostly dependent on the school
I read: Coraline, I'm the King of the Castle, Christmas Carol, etc
It was mostly English texts and not texts from other English speaking countries such as the USA or Australia but we did read the odd foreign text occasionally
I'm 33 so things will have changed but the best I can recall is: we read **a scene** from *Macbeth*; we read **a scene** from *Romeo & Juliet*; we read **[something, not the whole book]** from *The Time Machine*; we read **a poem** by two modern UK poets (Edit 3: Simon Armitage and Carol Ann Duffy)
Yeah, my school wasn't great
Edit: I ignored the rest of the class and just sat and read the whole of *The Time Machine*. I also got an F or a G in my English Literature GCSE
I printed off an essay from online to submit as my coursework because I suck at coursework
In my exam I wrote my name, about a paragraph on whatever shit we were supposed to write about, then put my head down for about an hour and a half and ignored the rest of it
I actually like to read but fuck disecting a goddamn scene, just let me read the fucking book and enjoy and appreciate it
I'm not disparaging the studying of literature but it has to be done right (i.e. **actually reading the fucking book**) and my school sucked giant donkey balls at it
Edit 2: I do like to read but I'm not going to pretend I'm well read
Off the top of my head the following are books I've read in their entirety:
* *The Time Machine*
* *1984* (twice)
* *Animal Farm*
* *Keep The Aspidistra Flying*
* The Orwell book where the daughter of a vicar works on a farm
* *Norwegian Woods*
* *Crime And Punishment*
* *Men Without Women*
* *The Count Of Monte Cristo*
* The Harry Potter series
* *The Hobbit*
* *Pride And Prejudice*
* The first two books of the Game of Thrones series
* *Blood Song*, *Queen Of Fire* and *Tower Lord*
* *A Dance Of Cloaks* There's two other books in that saga/series(?)
I've read them but can't remember the name
* *Waking Fire*
* Two books from the Sharpe series
They were both set in South America IIRC
Plus about 4 or 5 others who's name I can't remember
I've also started several books but not finished them
I've read *The Lord Of The Rings* as far as Shelob's cave
How much of them did you actually read (as part of the curriculum, not independently)
Just remembered I read holes which I think was most likely written in the USA
How much of them did you actually read (as part of the curriculum, not independently)
How much of them did you actually read (as part of the curriculum, not independently)
Better than my school
We read a scene from *Macbeth* (I think), a scene from *Romeo And Juliet* and a chapter or two from *The Time Machine*. Plus two - maybe three - poems by modern UK poets

Financial company so I get;
Discount on banking products,
Employee mortgage (this is huge, saves me £5k/year, easily),
Car lease scheme that comes from gross pay, not net, so it saves a considerable amount on tax
Private health care (to a certain limit),
Car breakdown cover,
Mobile phone insurance,
Travel insurance,
And my journey to and from work is paid for (train/taxi fare or petrol)
There's a bunch of other odds and ends, but the mortgage tracks the bank of England base rate, so 0
75% currently
Oh, browsing through the other replies, I remembered:
Doubled pension contributions; if I put in 20, they put in 40
Access to discounted shares with a price floor ( that floor looks pretty goddamn handy right now )
Doubled share contributions without a price floor (would need to lose more than 50% share price before this could be bad value)

Sorry I can't understand a word you're saying
Jamaican/Caribbean dialect can be hard to understand
If they go full on patois it's almost impossible to understand
Australian/American/Canadian/New Zealand/South African/Indian/Jamacian/Caribbean/Hong Kong/Singapore/Nigerian/Ghanian etc etc
Its all very easy to understand tbh
Ive yet to have any real difficulties in understanding
Australians/Americans/Canadians/Kiwis especially are extremely easy to understand
Their accents and versions of English really are no different to British english
Caribbean, African, Asian & Indian Englishes can much more difficult to understand only when they move away from English and go into more of a pattois/English-local language dialect hybrid etc that can be very hard to impossible to understand
But outside of that i think most Brits have no difficulty understanding the English spoken in any of the countries i mentioned
If anything other thick regional British accents are actually harder to understand than say an Aussie or American
Have more trouble with English dialects than non British ones
Aus, SA, NZ, CA, US all easy
If you count Pidgin and Patois then maybe for sure they're pretty much unintelligible for the British
Not at all
I've heard that Venezuelan accents and dialects are especially hard to understand, is that true
TIL it's just coriander
Heard it a couple times in American media, just thought it was me not knowing shit about cooking
Je ne connaissais pas le mot 'plouc' haha
Merci
Mais oui, tu as tout à fait raison
Nope
I still can't make it out
Pretty easy, there are some weird dialects there, but you can usually work it out from Context
In my experiences further North Accents are harder because we have a habit of mixing words into one, so it can be more difficult to get the context in the first place
For example in the Midlands, many informal dialects remove the Definate article and de emphasise parts of words
For example, an older Dialect:
*You're going to Nottingham yeah
Take this and give it to the police
Thanks*
Sounds like:
*Goin Nott'num yeah, cop'ouda dis n'and it ta filth, Taduck
Most people don't speak like this unless they know you'll understand, so we rarely have problems
unless it's *regional inner london vernacular* (ie
degenerate chavspeak) the most difficult dialects are from the north of england, especially newcastle
Actually, I disagree
I find Americans much harder to understand in real life than on TV
The pace of speech really throws me off

The battle of Hastings 1066
I think that sown the seeds of our class division
The idea idea that our ruling class are actually a different people
To be honest, we've had so many major historical events that there's not one single culturally defining one
I feel like I could name 10 equally important events
Battle of Edington which defeated the Vikings and helped form the creation of England, Battle of Hastings, The Black Death, the English Reformation, Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Battle of Waterloo and the wider Napoleonic wars which fostered the British identity, even the Battle of Plassey that provided the UK with enormous influence over the Indian subcontinent and later the world, and of course WW2 (mainly the Blitz and D-Day)
It is impossible to name one as being more important than another in the shaping of who we are
I learned about it in my grade 12 English class in Canada
We were taught that the Norman rule defined so much of the English language and culture
I hate it neat but love it in cocktails

Everyone know the London museums so I'm going to pitch in some museums outside of London:
National Coal Mining Museum (you get to go down a mine)
National Railway Museum (They have trains)
National Armouries (They have armour and weapons)
National Science and Media Museum (They've got a Walace and Gromit set)
National Space Museum (They have a rocket in a tower with the cafe underneath)
Crich Tramway museum (You can ride an old double decker team)
Bletchley Park (Place where they broke codes in WW2
Black Country Living Museum (Life in the Black Country (near Birmingham))
Imperial War museum (war)
All of these are brilliant and most are days out all on there own
I'm a bit of a museum need
Edit: Fixed formatting
NCMM is a great shout
It really is something we should be proud of
Especially as they are free
Fun fact: Fried chicken like KFC etc well its actually a British invention, more specifically it was created in Scotland, and they then brought that to America, where iirc the world famous seasoning aspect came from the slaves with their African culinary tradition, and the two(Scottish fried chicken, the technique and the African seasoning techniques then combined, melded together to form the KFC style fried chicken we know today
It could be said it's a fusion food combing two very different culinary styles(Scottish and African) yet the two go perfectly together)
I digress, [here's the original British fried chicken, here it is from 1736(although that's just when it was written down in a recipe book, it probs dates back even earlier just undocumented)
But to answer your question
KFC is literally everywhere here
Every major city and town has many multiple KFCs
They're definitely part of the landscape here
We also have many non-KFC fried chicken places that basically make the same food as KFC too, there's even more of them
Tbh it's not that nice, most KFCs and fried chicken places are best avoided
The quality of the food is often awful(although it's a franchise, so whether the food quality is good or not depends on which KFC your at, but still it's annoying how the food quality is not consistent across the various KFCs)
But to clarify KFC is extremely prevalent in England/The UK
Hmm
I wonder if a gyros with McDonald's chips would be any good
Although in my experience McD is more highly trafficked, due to the fact that it is cheaper and has a better customer experience
It depends what you mean by "cook" tbh
I'm 22 and would say I'm average for a guy from the UK in terms of cooking skill
I can make basic meals, like full English breakfasts, Spaghetti Bolognese, various meals with Chicken and rice or chicken and potatoes etc, made fried chicken and fish and chips and burgers during the lockdown too, homemade pizzas etc
What I can't do, is make big 'family' style meals, or cook steaks (but that's because my studio flat has a crap electric cooker)
Not Northern Ireland
Lmao so many people are forgetting that in the comments its funny
Wooooah
An American admitting that *anyone* besides themselves did something to help win the war
What is this
A lot, it varies pretty much everywhere but I personally find London influences pretty much the entire country in some way
Having been born and raised well outside of London only to move here a few years ago, I have to say it’s much better
London is more interesting, diverse, convenient and exciting
People are far nicer here and noticeably less prejudiced and narrow-minded
You could almost say it’s like a completely different country, in that the rest of the country sucks and London doesn’t.
This seems to be a common theme amongst the replies
Capital cities seem to often alienate the rest of the country
Lol that’s so telling
Mums bought me a lotto ticket every year since I turned 16 for Christmas cos her mum used to do it for her and her sisters but I think that’s more of a family tradition than a national one

Funny you should ask - just the other day Boris was talking about relocating the House of Lords to York, but I don't think anyone took him seriously
There has been a move in the last few years to move some government departments outside London, though, particularly the bits run by the civil service rather than politicians, while the BBC, which is a public institution, if not strictly governmental, has been doing a lot more production at "regional" sites in the last few years
*Doctor Who* was made by BBC Wales in Cardiff from 2005, and there's a big new media city in Salford
Don't forget the new proposal to move the Lords to either York or Birmingham is getting some serious clout
Also you now have media centres in Salford (BBC) and Leeds (C4)
Not to mention the oil/energy capital of Texas
Anything by Shakespeare
For me, French is easier to understand than shakespearean english
If you tell me what a certain line is supposed to say then I can see why it says that but on reading it the first time, I have no clue what it means
And then you have to write essays about it analysing the language when you barely even understand what it says on a surface level never mind in more depth
Honestly Shakespeare is really hard for me to understand
I'm learning french and I understand french more than I understand Shakespearean english even though the latter is supposed to be my native language
That's kind of cool but I'm wondering how that would work in terms of exams and assessments
Also in terms of teaching
For example, the reason you have to read specific books in england is because you will have exams where they ask you an essay question about the book and you have to write about it
But even if you dont have exams, the teachers have to teach you about the book and how to analyse it and what it means etc
Obviously in the exam they cant think of a question about every english literature book in existence and in lessons they cant teach you about every book, the class has to all be reading the same book
In primary school we had to read books in our spare time and after you read a certain number of their "easy" books you could choose to read any book you like so maybe that's what you're referring to
I find anything because a chore when its forced
In primary school we had to read a certain amount of books but they forced you to read these shitty easy books made by this company before you could read proper books of your choosing
You had to fill in this book to show what books you've read and they had a chart on the wall of who reads the most
Thing is I was always an avid reader but was always at the back because I didnt want to read their shitty books about children who can wiggle their ears
I see but then what did you do in your literature lessons
How could they teach you if you weren't all reading the same book
Also I feel theres a bit of ambiguity about what literature is
For example, is Harry Potter english literature
Some would say yes, others would say no because theres a feeling that it has to be old to be classed as literature
Tbh in a way that makes more sense because I found with GCSE english literature exams that you basically end up just remembering the interpretation and analysis of specific quotes rather than thinking of it yourself
Our school had to choose one book from a list of books in various categories so we had to do a shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, a modern novel and one of a choice of two collections of poems
We did respectively: Macbeth, Jeckyll and hyde, animal farm and poems about power and conflict
We did have GCSE English language exams though where they gave you extracts from books you probably haven't read before (usually obscure books or short stories) and have to analyse it which I suppose makes you use the skills more
But yeah I guess your systems approach is more about learning the skills than about memorizing which I think is better
I did gcse english lit 2 years ago and had to remember loads of quotes from the texts and the analysis of each quote
It's super pointless because I cant really remember what I learnt now other than a few miscellaneous lines from Macbeth
The word "nonce" has come on leaps and bounds recently
It means paedophile, and for the most part it has been quite a taboo word
Lately it's become a lot more casual as an insult and can be used in a lot more situations, even jokey ones
"Milk in your tea first
nonce", "wearing a full kit to a football match
nonce". It doesn't even have to be related to being a paedophile anymore
I remember just a couple years ago my sister calling me a nonce jokingly and our whole family had to explain to her what that word meant and you can't just bandy it about like a common insult
Now she could
i fucking hate this word tbh, it's unjustly ubiquitous
it's a really harsh insult and yet it's been tossed around so liberally that it's losing meaning
do you understand what the indo-european language family is
I think the tone plays a big part
If you spit the word out with venom it can be a really cutting and nasty word
At the same time it can be really jokey with a more relaxed tone
Nonce
I thought all Bulgarians would be like my friends
I was wrong
They weren't bad, just not friendly and personable like my friends are
Maybe it's because they live in the UK though so they go out of their way to be nicer than they would with other Bulgarians
Edit: The best time I had was actually with a couple of Romanian blokes I met in my hotel lobby
We spent the night drinking vodka neat (or at least what I remember of the night)

Are you joking
Rural Austria is full of people in Lederhosen
London is actually quite dry compared to the rest of the UK, so much so that there have been occasional water shortages
Try the Northwest for that authentic British depression in the skies
When I was on holiday in Malta, I met a Maltese lady who had visited England
She was complaining about how awful the weather was, and I asked when she had visited us, which happened to be in the middle of February, the worst possible time of the year

There are places where the majority of people are wearing them

The cost of housing the UK (especially cities) is destroying disposable income for all young people
My parents were pretty normal middle class but we still went skiing in France/Italy/Austria most winters and would summer in Spain/Italy/Portugal with the occasional trips further away like to the US or something
But now I cant see people who have similar jobs to them being able to do such things
There is noway my parents would ever have been able to afford the house or the life we had when I was a kid if we did it all now
If we did have disposable income like we did back in the 90s investments like stocks etc isnt really that part of our culture
Obviously people do invest but your normal middle class family is more likely to spend disposable income on holidays than on investment portfolios
I am glad my childhood is full of amazing memories traveling around Europe and other parts of the world rather than my dad giving me some numbers on a piece of paper when I turn 18 or whatever
I have a pretty decent disposable income but honestly I spend it on luxury goods or I save it for maybe one day buying a house
Wealth inequality is a gaping void in the UK, there's a very real North/South divide aswell as a centuries old entrenched class system
I’m pretty certain I’ve read before that we have the largest wealth inequalities in Europe, which really does not come as a surprise
Yeah, it makes us lazy
One of my biggest regrets is being monolingual
I'm trying to make sure my kids don't make the same mistake
If you’re only talking about the north Germanic languages, there’s something unique about Danish
Including all languages spoken in Nordic countries, Finnish and Greenlandic are both special, each in very unique ways
Finnish for me
I really like Finnish
I have a mild obsession with Finland
Such a unique country
They all sound the best
Its impossible to choose
1 - BBC One
2 - BBC Two

This especially annoys me with Verb endings, which are pronounced similarly but can change the meaning of a sentence substantially
Sure they are a lot of differences but, as a second language learner, they can be very hard to pick up when listening
Latvia: It'll be fine I guess, we were already merged for centuries and we get along well with each other well so it wouldn't be too bad
I would imagine it'd be like a Belgium situation with 2 different highly autonomous regions and languages

Right now, I’d probably support that

was an interesting conversation
Sadly some Brits still refer to Czechia as Czechoslovakia, so I can understand this

I wouldn't particularly say so, no
Once I was on a particularly jerky bus, and a guy was eating some kind of watery Chinese   broth out of one of those plastic rectangular trays
It was sloshing about everywhere
A few actually
Mötorhead, Deep Purple, Def Leppard, Rainbow, honestly there's too many good English bands to name
Edit: AC/DC's Australian not British
There’s an interesting story behind the name
Back when England invaded Wales and had a lot of soldiers stationed there, when a local woman had a child with a soldier, the kid was a “John’s child” as the welsh people nicknamed the soldiers John due to it being a very common English name
In the welsh accent, it sounds like Jones, and that became their surname
In the UK, I feel it’s pretty much split between north and south
Northerners will say “hi” and “thanks” to the bus driver, have a little chat to the supermarket cashier etc
In London, people very much go about their day and keep chit chat to a minimum
It's definitely "Cheers Drive
" when getting off the bus in these parts
It's pretty universal general friendliness wherever I've been across the UK
General talk about the weather
Unless you're talking to the taxi driver, in which case it has to be something really deep and philosophical especially for a drunk at 3am
There's an older chap that passes pushing his bike along past our house, groceries in the basket, usually as I'm leaving for work
Always get a proper chat with him
I don't know him, who he is, his name, where he lives, but we always have a chat
You get the full “good morning” out
I’m Northern, so i’m not sure whether this is a regional thing or a wider English/British thing, but I almost exclusively say/hear “mornin’”. Seems a bit of a mouthful to get one extra syllable in for absolutely no reason
Saying "I could murder a Chinese/Indian right now" doesn't mean you want to commit a hate crime, it just means you'd really like to eat some Chinese or Indian food
Well it doesn't entirely rule out them being a crackhead, that might have been why it was such good craic
Very
Definitely a beard renaissance going on
It'll be a lot less in the future because fashions trends always change
I would say maybe 50% of men have some kind of facial hair in the UK
In fairness I haven’t been out in public a lot recently for obvious reasons, but beards definitely started gaining popularly in the last decade or so
And in my personal opinion, long may that trend continue
Love bearded men
So gorge
Yeah I do think it's more of a renaissance though, had mine about 10 years and still now when I mention maybe getting rid my mates and partner react in horror
Maybe I'm hideous without one, although my partner of 5 years has never seen me without said beard
I can definitely relate to the weak moustache
Probably another summer of 'football is coming home' just to bottle it in the quarters or semis on penalties
I think England will scrape through to the Semi's without playing a good team
The whole country (me included) will be sure that we're going to win it this time
Then we'll play France or Belgium and lose by 3 or 4 goals
It depends who we play in the Knockout Stage, but probably Last 16, maybe Quarter Final, again it depends on how the knockout stage works out
If you make it out the group stage and we don't I'm deleting twitter
Hah, the age old English problem
We need to win every match against Scotland
They only need to win one
It would be a new national holiday,  lol
It's a pretty crazy group
3/4 of the top teams I'd expect to make semi's without groups stages in the same group
I think you will though
If your players turn up on the day you have the best team by far
I love Irish
A lot of people don’t know that Ireland has its own language but if you look it up you’ll find it
I’m not sure why it just sounds so cool to me
I don't think anyone considers William Beresford a hero
Trying to think of a British national hero who wouldn't be thought of as a villain in another country
Boudicca maybe
...you think she was considered a "hero" in England
Cromwell is not liked in England though
Cromwell is the only thing that British monarchists and Irish republicans can agree on
He can burn in hell for all I care
> Michiel de Ruyter
Literally who
Don't forget that he (rightly, in my opinion) also wanted the Allies to declare war on the Soviet Union at the end of the Second World War
There are many of us who hate Cromwell
It is pretty much the only thing us British monarchists and Irish republicans can agree on, though for slightly different reasons
What he did in Ireland was unforgivable, mind
Meh, it's not so much him as his sons
Sir David Attenborough
He's a nobody
I mean it didn't seem to stop us very much in the long run so yeah not really
A language is a dialect with an army

>Why it’s okay to call white people white, and using “black” is offensive
Where is this a thing, I've never heard of it, is this a language thing
From an outside perspective, most Brits would definitely say that the Baltics are part of Eastern Europe
For example, many people claim that the UK is Northern Europe, however most people would say it's Western Europe
You're too "attached" (mainly geographically) to Eastern Europe to be considered NE from my personal perspective
Never mind the ethnic/linguistic/cultural/historical differences
"Scotland, and the UK"
Scotland is the uk
Yeah IMO Northern Europe is very much the Scandi countries
It isn't an uneducated guess, I agree with the guy you're responding to
Most people agree that the Baltics are EE
>Most people also don't differentiate between someone from NI, Scotland, Wales, or England and just call everything together "England" and everyone "English"
Nobody does that except for Americans, from my understanding
They are all different countries so struggling to differentiate between them, as a European, would be fairly ignorant IMO
It would be like me saying Spain and Portugal are the same because they're Iberian
The only difference is that they aren't in a union
Yep
There are actually arguments out there that would classify English as a Northern European language due to the early influences from the Jutes/Angles and the later influence from the Norse
Even still it is classified as West Germanic because these are fringe arguments that tend to nitpick at small details rather than look at the bigger picture or common perceptions
In the same vein, some will say that the UK is part of northern Europe due to certain historical/linguistic factors but I don't see it
We are Western European, in my opinion, due to our lack of isolation from the rest of Europe/the world and our geopolitical and cultural influence
It's still up for debate whether or not we're even NE geographically or not
The connection is far too weak
Yes besides "Baltics can into Nordic" meme culture I'm sure nobody knows anything about the Baltic's political or cultural climate
I understand their close link to the scandies but rightly or wrongly I feel that the majority of Europeans just don't see such a strong link between the two
>Ask around how many languages in Europe use "England" as shorthand for the UK in colloquial speech
I will be sure to ask my Eastern European partner that tomorrow morning, although I already know what the answer will be
&#x200B;
> And in general, calling former USSR colonies "Eastern Europe" is the same as calling the "countries" (regions really) of the UK England
It would be done only by ignorant people, since it makes LESS sense than calling Scotland England
After all, England STILL rules those three "countries" in a large proportion, while Russia has indirect influence at best on "Eastern Europe".
England does not "rule" the rest of the countries in the UK at all
Just look at the former and the current Socttish referendum movement
Yes there are a lot of political shenanigans that aren't ethical or right, but England does not "rule" or "control" the other countries in the Union
I didn't say that the Baltics were Eastern European due to former USSR rule, that didn't even come into consideration
Russia's previous control had/has no bearing on the general consensus IMO
I disagree completely
The Normans had a great impact but it can't overshadow the impact of \~600 years of Anglo-Saxon rule
Our language is still Germanic and I don't want to delve too deep into our ethnic background, but considering the fact that I live in Yorkshire, I would say that "native" English people could have such a distinction too
The Norman impact was primarily political and linguistic, and while they brought a great deal of influence to our country, throwing away 600 years of history is a bit short-sited IMO
Weird how people will always remember William the Conqueror, a French invader, over Alfred the Great, who was arguably the savior of England, and the man who subdued the Vikings
I think it speaks volumes of the failures of our school systems to teach us history
Who cares about the foundation of this country when you can learn that Henry the fat cunt exploded in his coffin
Dude, as much as I appreciate the effort, we simply will not agree
Despite former USSR rule I would still consider the Baltics as part of Eastern Europe
I wasn't even alive during the USSR but I still see it that way
This isn't some remnant of the past, though, I'm pretty sure it's common opinion
Also my gf is from a latin langauge speaking country so, if I've been listening to her right (dear God I hope I have), then they have distinct words/phrases for the UK and its constituent countries
As for your other points, democratically the other British/NI countries are not ruled by England
Yes, England could roll tanks into Scotland in the event of an independence vote, or simply fuck them politically
Of course many of us (including myself) don't agree with this, but in a union someone has to be the strongest member
That doesn't mean that, on paper, the strongest member rules the rest
It simply means that they have the capacity to rule the rest
I hope to the Universe that in the event of another referendum it doesn't boil down to violence
Yep, always
The only time I might wear shoes inside is if I'm about to go out and have already put my shoes on and then realise I forgot something in another room
I've never known anyone not to do this
Disregarding cleanliness, surely it would be too clunky to have shoes on inside
In fact, outside of winter, I only put socks on when I need to put my shoes on, and usually I take them off soon after I take my shoes off
So I'm barefoot most of the time indoors
I never take off my shoes unless I’m getting in bed
Wait, really
You'd say being barefoot inside is gross
I honestly would never have considered that an issue
At what point *do* you take your shoes off if you wear them indoors
I mean, surely you can't wear them in bed, so do you take them off right before, in your bedroom then
Do you take them off just before you get in the bath
What about cuddling up on the settee
Or just generally lazing around
And what, do you put them on first thing in the morning when you get out of bed
I'm genuinely not sure how it works haha
It just seems so bizarre
Fair enough I guess
I was just surprised that that was an issue for some people
I mean, I kind of get where you're coming from, but it's only feet haha
I only meant it was bizarre in that it's completely alien to me (i.e. wearing shoes indoors)
And the questions were just because I genuinely didn't know what people did and where exactly they drew the line
To me, actually wearing shoes in bed isn't all that much more bizarre than wearing them in the bedroom
It's not necessarily obvious
It's all relative
Why are you so hung up about this
> You must have been in plenty of houses in England, where shoes are worn
Nope
Next to none
I've found out from this thread that this isn't universal, but it's not something I have experience with myself
That's why it just feels a little bizarre
It's unfamiliar; that's all
To me, you take your shoes off and put them on by the door
It seems bizarre to me to do this say in the bedroom or something
It's like an outdoor winter coat; it would just feel *odd* to go around wearing it inside
It goes against what I've grown up considering basic normal universal habits: you wear shoes outside not inside
It's challenging something I thought was normal and *that's how the world is* that makes it feel bizarre
Nothing wrong with it
Just feels strange to me
Make sense
As a kid, my mum would cook these sometimes
We had a large garden which meant lots of leaves/branch cuttings to dispose of, so there were often bonfires
I just want to say thank you to Turkey for exporting döner kebab to the UK
It's wildly popular here as a late night food, but I too do not trust the chicken version
That said, *nobody* really knows what goes into the lamb version
Probably orphans and stray dogs
In a similar vein, theres a [Cafe Vergnano] around the corner from my office in a Tudor building
And around the corner from that is [This Pret] on Fleet Street
That place is like a posh hotel lobby
Its no longer vodaphone and now a shoe shop (I think its Loake) who have a similar sign - Im guessing theres some rules about signs at that part of the city
Yeah Fleet Street is full of buildings and statues like that but they're hard to notice as its such a congested place
Yeah I’ve been inside it before
I am very anxious but more so for my vulnerable family members than myself

Good luck with your studies
Hello mate
Done the survey, I’m nit massively worried for myself
More worried for my elderly family, especially those with underlying health issues

You’re almost definitely a smarter man than me but thought I’d let you know that I think (in my limited knowledge) you could have included a question or two on how worried people are for their family

People are generally aware that some people do eat rabbit and that rabbit meat is considered food
It's not like eating a dog or something
That said, many people wouldn't want to eat rabbit themselves due to being primarily familiar with them as pets

Great write up
where I live, in the smaller towns and villages, piemontese is still spoken fairly widely although of course less with younger generations
But there are some bigger towns such as Dronero which are kinda famous for the fact that everyone, even kids speak it to a greater extent

We seem to be meeting Croatia a lot lately
We stand a chance against them, and should beat Czechia
The other team is not decided yet but it looks like a decent group for us
We should get tested by Croatia but should still go through, which is probably the ideal scenario
Oh goody
Croatia again
could be a lot worse, just annoyed we got fucking Croatia again we just can't seem to escape them

Scotland may very well leave, dunno what will happen to Ireland
soon it will just be England and Wales
So sad
Really not that bothered, we would he better off if NI and Scotland left the UK anyway
The only downside I see to Scotland leaving is we're likely to be dominated by Tories for the foreseeable future
I don't see any downside to NI leaving or Wales for that matter
I'm much, much more worried about us leaving the EU
Don't care
Reality is very little would change in my life
Scotland would be a separate country but guarantee there would be a similar situation to Ireland with free movement and no border
And Scottish will keep the pound too
but I don't think it's guaranteed to happen by any means And people saying Wales will leave are taking the piss
No, and I'm not worried about it happening
Northern Ireland is certain to be part of the UK in the medium term due to the Unionist community outnumbering the Republican community, and the Unionist Community being largely pro Brexit
Scotland can't leave the UK unless the Government changed, as the Conservatives have said they would not allow another referendum in Scotland, and polls indicate a big lead for Johnson in an election ATM
A lot of Europeans don't realise the Scottish parliament cannot call an independence referendum, it needs a majority vote in the UK parliament to happen
Wales wouldn't leave because they are very economically dependant on England, and Wales voted leave, so having a country the size of Wales independent but not in the EU while being so closely tied to England isn't really viable
We're already dominated by Tories
The liberal influence of Scotland barely ever changes the results of political votes and decisions
Something my n. irish BF has always told me about
And it's true
Very sad
I find it strange how Europeans ejaculate over the thought of breaking the UK up
What is the likelihood of a perpetual Tory government with Scotland still part if the UK compared to a UK without Scotland
There is a difference, regardless of the recent SNP surge
>but a lot of people have a strong sense of national pride about the whole of the UK
English people, you mean
I'm just saying that Scotland feels forgotten and unrepresented *because they are*. Aside from their devolved government, barely any of their political decisions affect national policy
Obviously there is a difference, but it's really not that much at all
Scotland was very much part of the Rule Britannia era
Check out the Scottish exploits in Guyana for example
Scottish aren't the victims but the perpetrators in that era
The bigger issue is that Scotland can't just leave
They need a vote in the UK parliament, not the Scottish parliament, to get a referendum, and the Conservative policy right now is to refuse any request for another referendum on Scottish independence, and although there will probably be an election soon, Boris has a big lead in the polls now
we have a tory government right now because of scotland, if that's not their political decisions affecting national policy i'm not sure what is
The way English national pride is based so heavily in the past
Yes, we used to be the most powerful country in the world and now we're not
I just wish that instead of moping about Britains decline, more people would think about how we can become a great country in a modern, progressive, positive way
Scientific advancement
Fixing the environment
Just generally making UK, and the world a better place to live
Why does greatness have to be tied to our imperialist past and all its negative connotations

London is 40% (or less now) white British
Foreign born people make a significant % of the population
London isn't a good place to experience British or English culture
I identify as both
I chose the English flair though, because I think it's more helpful for non- UK people to see that my comments come from a specifically English persons perspective
Unfortunately, it's been utilised too much by far right nationalist groups
It doesn't have a far right origin though, so I don't see why we can't just reclaim it
I would never ask for no onion
London and Westminster are still technically two different cities to this day, in terms of local government at least
It's all sausage to me
That the Union Jack doesn’t include the welsh flag because when it was created Wales was seen as a part of England so only N.Ireland, Scotland and England’s flags were included
Wales=Cymru in welsh (probably already known)
The vikings continuously attacked the welsh coast lines in the 10th century and took a lot of welsh into slavery
The Romans struggled to beat the welsh and make them compliant
There were around 13 campaigns between AD48 and 79 and the Romans weren't used to the Welsh guerrilla fighters of the mountains
Seems alright lots of people I know have been on holiday there
It's fucking ours
If I may shamelessly plug a mate's book, *[The Hunter] by Andrew Reid, available on Kindle and dead-tree edition

Because it's bad for the EU
That's why Scottish independence = weakens UK position, strengthens EU position = good
Whereas Catalan independence = weakens EU integrity = bad
Sock puppets also supported Scottish Independence
No one here seems to have a problem with that
Any subversive movement is supported by our enemies sock puppets
That doesn't delegitamise the movement

I often say "seldom". What's wrong with it
It's a handy, short, word that gets shit out of the way
People tend to use stuff like "rarely" or "almost never". Check the amount of syllables to say that:
Sel

ly - 3
most
ver - 4
If you seldom use seldom, you should consider using it more often
I'd say, "it's pissing it down", "it's chucking it down" or, "it's really coming down

1991 I started learning this verdammte language
I've lived in Austria, I have a bloody *degree* in it
And this is the first I've heard that it's supposed to be dankeschön not danke schön
So'n schoas
I was taught they were separate words at school
Not sure about this one
Some people do say for sure
That's awfully specific
Funny that the English singular "you" is a remainder of a time in which there used to be a formal pronoun in English
The real singular, second person pronoun in English is "thou". "You" is certainly plural
Which is interesting to note, since many languages use third person or plural as a form of formal addressing device
Check Portuguese: "você" which is formal in Portugal (but not in Brazil anymore), it uses third person verb form and derives from a contraction of "vossa mercê", which means "your (plural) [benefit/desire/will]".
Italian has its share of weirdness too, considering that "lei" and "lui" are objective cases of "ella" and "egli". "Lei" is also third person and used for second person formal addressing
You can actually translate it to English as "thee".
Add to that madness the remainder of genders in English and the fact that "it" represents a neutral gender (therefore not masculine nor feminine, so it could be used with unknown gender), and not an object or animal
Now because of political correctness people are using "they" instead of "it" to address people of unknown gender, we will end up with plurals as becoming singulars
It's madness

Just don’t make the mistake we did and use flammable cladding
Jesus
The funny/sad thing is that a bunch of “luxury flats” near me suddenly got new cladding just after Grenfell too (so at least builders cut corners across class boundaries, right
The inquiry is still ongoing (repeatedly suspended due to covid)
(I’m willing to bet there will be no meaningful consequences for anyone, though
Yes
Sorry
On reflection it does seem rough to blame the builders (as they’re not likely to be the procurers anyway)
Although I didn’t know the suppliers had actually lied, that’s incredible
Bloody hell
That’s abominable
(And, why isn’t this more widely known
I mean, I’m relatively certain it’s still being blamed (by some) on the the Conservative Kensington and Chelsea council
I’m not sure that “the media and the ruling party” being “on the same side” actually makes sense as a reason here - after all, if the media were on the same side as the [I assume you mean Tories, and I’m not sure I’d go that far - after all, Owen Jones is a well-known part of the media
] wouldn’t it make far more sense for them to throw Celotex to the dogs
(Fwiw, I have read those books and many others
Re: the private buildings with that cladding - yes, true
Although, as with many things, it’s a situation that could use a little nuance - after all, the issue with Grenfell (as I understand it) was a) that it is a very, very tall building, and b) that the cladding was applied to a pre-existing concrete tower block, creating a rare set of factors that made this fire so ferocious and so dangerous
On a three or four storey building where the cladding covers hollow walls stuffed with insulation and etc
(such as with many new-builds), I can imagine the dangers posed actually being far lower
Maybe I’m wrong, and obviously having a building made of anything flammable seems daft (although I guess most interiors are anyway), but you see what I mean
That all sounds very sensible
Particularly about the independent body (which anticipated my first objection to the “needs more regulation” thing, since - presumably, given that Celotex lied - the current regulation already legislates against using flammable materials as cladding

Sure, it's great to have a big section on local history, but I like it when they have sections on other regions and cultures too
I can't afford to travel the world (or even Europe) to see all the historic artefacts, so the only way I'd get to see them is if they're in a local museum
It would be nice if museums around the world could share their collections and rotate them around so more people get the chance to see them
I got really excited when the Egyptian museum put the Tutenkahmun collection on tour- unfortunately coronavirus shut everything down the week I'd booked to see it in London :(

Are you saying that Britain can't "make greatness"? Half the inventions of the modern world are from British inventors
Loads of influential art, films and music
Wow so when you buy things; what your really doing is stealing them, got it
No you cant, 8 million artifacts in the British Museum, no way are more than 50% non british
Give back my tapestry first you French bastard
Yea
sorry about that :/
The British museum is exactly that, artefacts from around the world and all it ever gets for that is criticism
>Today Egypt is a country that has a pretty good record of looking after artefacts
Even today this is not true
Only a few years ago they did permanent damage to a Mummy due to incompetent academic staff
Also have you seen where they keep their artifacts
Dirty fucking warehouses where shit is just piled up and unlabelled
It's a "great fire" waiting to destroy it
Britain is doing the world a service by looking after the Egyptian objects it has
Because (1) It has the skills and tech to get more useful research than Egypt will ever have (2) It stores it's artifacts in a way that means they'll still be here in 2100, whereas Egypt's warehouse will probably have burned down by then
Yeh it's not like Greece would ever allow it's most prestigious and important historical symbols be destroyed
On a seperate note, why did the Parthenon get blown up
Germany BTFO
I am going to name that more iconic duo and it is Great Britain and Portugal
England and colonising
the World Wide Web which the user used to make that comment was made by a Brit lmao
That would be stealing
Sure if you pay for them, just like the British did with the statue
No one would give a shit
Fry ups, Sunday Roasts, Fish and Chips are all banging
Don't you have some grease to inject
Arizona has London Bridge, do you hear us crying
Ahh
The old directions-in-kilometers problem
What
It was taken from London and rebuilt in Arizona
....nobody knows if it was stolen
let's just hope she isn't a vampire
Happy New Year
Happy New Year guys
This is a great picture
It’s just so sad how hard these people have to fight just for their basic rights, especially in Europe
All my love to them
You're even anti-anti-everything
People on Twitter overreacting because Trump did something, truly shocking
Top banter
Can you imagine being the emergency services operator and getting the call that Notre Dame is on fire, must have thought it was a joke
Just tragic
A beautiful art work of architecture
Absolutely heartbreaking
I studied history, love ancient and mediaeval sites
Notre dame is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen
This is horrible
Truly heartbreaking
I admire your optimism but what made Notre-Dame so special was the amazing wooden interior, its not like cathedrals that are all stone work like the Frauenkirche
The stuff that truely makes is a wondrous building is literally on fire
Yeah I immediately thought of the York Minster fire after this news, especially with  the front face being similarish in style to Notre Dame
That old stone is surprisingly resilient and I'm sure the bulk of it will survive despite the spire collapsing
What the FUCK
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ooooooooooooo fuck you, ya got me
This is a Rick roll
Nothing more
You're a cheeky cunt
you had me for a moment there ngl
I was gonna say, surely this is Rickrolling
Here in Britain most people wont let an ambulance through normal traffic
I think that due to this, my great great grandparents left Armenia to come to England
He doesn't represent all of us
May and the Tory’s are remain
They’ve put no effort in for exactly this reason
The loonies who also voted remain
The year is 2192
The British Prime Minister visits Brussels to ask for an extension of the Brexit deadline
No one remembers where this tradition originated, but every year it attracts many tourists from all over the world
U.K. : Actually can I stay a few more months then I really am going to go
This is exactly our plan
No mistake
They can't be homeless if they're dead
Of course it's from the Tories
I mean, it's in line with Tory policies
The Space Race was perhaps the best part of the Cold War
Yeah, it was fuelled by rather fierce rivalry, and sometimes resulted in panic (especially with the launch of Sputnik 1)
However, it is probably the only part of the Cold War that resulted in the betterment of mankind
If it weren’t for each side trying to one up each other, it would have likely taken years longer for the first man to go to space, the first man to walk on the moon, and for us to reach where we are today, exploring Mars with rovers
It’s truly exciting stuff, and we have men like Yuri Gagarin to thank for helping pave the way for mankind’s exploration beyond our planet
Is spared the right word
I mean, it's not like it was a hostage from the fire
Survived might be a better word
Anyone else getting a Final Fantasy 7 vibe from this photo
I'm genuinely scared of what Brexit will do here, because if the experts were right, my quality of living will decrease
But if it doesn't, I'll have to live with a lifetime of *I told you so's*. That being said, if they change the NHS in any way, I can't see itself staying in this country for the foreseeable future
Is Ireland on that branch with us then with their 5% loss of GDP, more than ours
The worst part about Brexit for me, is being suspect to tons of piss taking by everyone else in the world for something boomers are doing that no one else wants
Honestly even though I don’t the UK being made fun of, I can see why people would
This situation is pretty wack
Edit: people seem to be mad at the my comment where I mentioned that “no one else wants” brexit
I’ll admit I over exaggerated
Oh god
this is so fucking true it hurts me deep inside
Fuck our politicians
I'm sorry Europe
Belive me when I say even parliament dosent understand brexit
Can we just fucking leave the EU already we’ve had about 6942000000000000000000000 votes on it and it’s ended in leave so just fuckin leave bruh
Misses the bit where the guy ask the cat to give it billions before he leaves
44% of Northern Ireland voted to leave
I don't really blame those people though
They're all miss informed and been sold lies by our politicians
Politician's have constantly left parts of our country behind and unheard
Using the EU as a scapegoat
Politician's allow the referendum in the first place, not for the country but to protect a party (the tories in this case)
Politician's decided to make the referendum legally binding when they could have just used is an advisory
So yes
people that voted for Brexit made the wrong choice (IMO), but I can't blame the vast majority of them
I still work with people who voted leave and believe it will be good for the country
That the no-deal needed to be on the table and the EU will balk
That we will land all these amazing trade deals
That all the economic downturn is because of our in-ability to leave, not a default due to leaving
One guy is like "well there is no precedent to this
so anything could happen
I'd rather take the risk, even if it's only once, doesn't workout and we have to rejoin".  I mean it's a fair point, it would work in smaller scenario's but applied to a whole country
that sort of risk taking is dangerous and if it doesn't work, it's not just a single failure point
Millions are affected, industries collapse
etc etc
IMO those risk's aren't worth taking
Whatever, it was 44% of the people who live under your flag
Just 9 percentage points less than the English
Plenty of Brexiters in your region of the UK
>To be fair, I’m kind of with them
Correct
They're Northern Irish, just like you
And like i've said, 44% of you voted for Brexit, and are dragging remainers out of the EU
But you blame the English, cause you're a fool
>  I’m not Northern Irish, I’m Irish
You had a northern Ireland flag when we began this conversation ... You know I saw that, right
Jog on, idiot
I'm not interested in anything else you have to say
It's more the customer saw fish on the menu and chose it, but has spent the whole evening having the staff of the restaurant tell them they should have chosen chicken without making any steps towards actually making the fish
The restaurant owners were so convinced everyone would choose chicken since that's what all there marketing had been in favour of that they never thought to actually stock up on fish
It would be more akin to the waiting staff not wanting to serve you fish, spitting in your food, and undercooking it and bringing it out in front of you and saying "see, fish is bad, have the meat" and expecting you to accept that fish is by default bad, and the fact they have actively attempted to sabotage your meal means you shouldn't want fish ever again
No thanks
Get back in the kitchen and make us some fucking fish
As the one other person on the table who wanted to order chicken has their head in their hands in anguish
Alternatively: you order the fish
They say that they have fish and will serve it, but then obfuscate and delay and make getting the fish impossible
If you were to then capitulate and order chicken, that was clearly what you wanted the entire time
They knew best
Leaving the EU isn't magical unfortunately for EuroZealots
It very much exists and is written into law infact
Splitting the leave vote in 2
No on is falling for your tricks
It's a good job the Remain Campaign spent 6 months prior to the Ref telling us we'd face economic Armageddon then wasn't it
Then surly the next referendum should be how to leave
Considering we already voted to leave the EU
No deal vs May deal
Every household was sent a leaflet explaining why Brexit is bad already
We get it
Yet we voted to leave anyway

Genuine question

Russia has the best argument imo
They are the third rome
Fucking jesus it's sad to see that this sub has degenerated to the levels of /r/unitedkingdom and /r/ukpolitics where everyone is posting "Brexit" just to get karma points
I voted remain but the comments in here make me sure as fuck hope for a hard Brexit and one that fucks you every which way from Sunday

I don't think this map is accurate
Why is Turkey represented here
It's not a European country
We haven't even left the EU yet
I think we ought to actually try being outside the EU for a period before it is deemed a mistake and steps are taken to reverse the policy
Remainers 2 years ago when we voted to leave: REEEEEEEEE FUCK THIS WE NEED A SECOND VOTE BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO LEAVE IS RACIST AND WE DIDN'T GET OUR WAY FUCK HOW THE VOTES TURNED OUT FUCK THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS GIVE US WHAT WE WANT NOW
Remainers now: We must respect the peoples wishes
ItS nOt DeMoCrAtIc OtHeRwIsE
What a load of hypocritical shite
The irony is not lost on us
I don’t think a single person, leave or remain is happy with how the negotiations have been handled and I know most people want her gone
Stop trying to paint it like everyone just agrees with may
But you know what, at least I can vote against her in the next election because she actually has to answer to us eventually
We know we can change our mind
We can have another referendum and vote to remain
Because neither ran single-issue campaigns and the only party who ran an anti-Brexit campaign was the Lib Dems, and they were just coming off alienating almost every single one of their supporters through continually betraying their promises the second they got some power
No campaigns, manifestos or even the Leave campaign itself ever promoted, supported or accepted the mere possibility of a no-deal Brexit either
We'll see
That’s the thing, it was a stupid vote
Like, say if you were asked to vote on “Would you like to live or die
” and everyone votes ‘live’ (because most would) and then you find out that the live option involves an eternal existence of absolute agony and loneliness and to die is revealed to mean passing away an old person surrounded by loved ones
See the problem there in holding people to vaguely defined absolute terms
Not another Chernobyl
Just feels like a European plight
We want our fucking snow back, old coworkers used to tell me it'd up to be their knees most of the time in winter (North England)

What happened
She obliged to follow the will of the British electorate
The European Union could learn a thing or two about respecting the result of referendums
>What changed
Dunno, might have been that big referendum
I'm glad these campaigners are becoming more honest about who their audience are
Clue: it's not the people of Sunderland or Birmingham
Yeah she’s a remainer
I don’t understand the confusion
Politicians are employed to speak and act on behalf of the country and constituents not their own opinions
I mean everyone knows she was a remainer but she's prime minister so she has to deliver Brexit
I wonder if the '#ledbydonkeys campaigners know how public opinion would feel about them posting billboards insulting the nation's leader in a foreign country
I'm honestly gobsmacked they thought this was a good idea
They'll be lucky if this goes under the radar
12200 Europeans looked at this and saw absolutely no way in which Theresa May could be a remainer AND still a Prime Minister
And you all would be crying if a Brexiteer was handed the reigns so this billboard and post is bullshit
One of the main reasons Brits voted for Brexit was because of the EU's Freedom Of Movement policy
To elaborate: The problem with FOM is that its a veeeeery, almost exclusively a one way thing(ie East>West, 1 million Poles in the uk since 2004 for purely monetary/economic reasons etc
The vast majority of Brits have no need or want to move to Poland/Eastern Europe in return
Why would they
, Or 60% of the entire Somali population of The Netherlands moving hede once they got their EU passports(Merkel's migrants would do exactly the same too)
That same personal economic/monetary benefit is not there for Brits
Its not helped by the fact everybody speaks English as a 2nd language, what language should Brits speak when they already speak the language of the world
FOM works if its between equally economically developed, cultrally similiar nations but FOM doesnt work if its between vastly unequally economically developed, cultrally very different nations etc
And its been a disaster here in England/UK
If the EU were smart they'd of recognised from the start that the UK has special circumstances regarding FOM, and that the UK should've been treated different and allowed to have exceptions/its own tailored FOM agreement
One size does not fit all like the EU seems to think
Hence we have Brexit
Also the problem with the EU for many Brits is that time and again, repeatedly over the years the EU has shown that its not interested in and has no intention of ever reforming itself
It has ignored the UK's wishes, ignored & even decieved the UK many times on many issues when it comes to reforms & certain EU policies that negatively effect the UK etc
So its clear that all the EU care about and the reason they're begging us to stay is cuz they desperately need and want our money
That's it
The EU have only just now realised that the 2nd biggest contributor to EU funds is going and they now have a huge hole in their budget and no other country is wealthy enough to pay for it or not willing or even in a position to pick up the slack etc
And with all due respect to the EU its too little to late
Some billboards aren't really that expensive
You realise Northern Ireland are very happy as they are right
They don't want reunification
Why are people so happy to simply ignore democratic will nowadays
I wasn't referring to the referendum in the United Kingdom
The intention of the poster is clear #ledbydonkeys , and it's location serves to make leavers think "I am so glad I didn't vote in line with the people who would do that".
That’s us
Well I think you are great bunch of lads Ireland, even if you do think I am a prick
Joking a side, never met an Irishman who had genuine hatred towards me as an Englishman, it's mostly been directed at our government and I totally agree with them there
Woop de doo
wierd how despite the Scottish being the ones who caused the Northern Ireland problem
England gets the blame for it
And the scottish love it, they just duck their heads and keep quiet, in the words of shaggy "it wasnt me". despite more scottish high ranking officers than English in the empire, despite their solo failed attempts at colonialism
it all gets dropped on England
even the Ulster-Scots problem
which has 'Scots' in the name
is Englands fault
Being from the north of England imma label myself as “great bunch of pricks”
Translation: I haven’t got anything funny to say
But I do hate English people
As an English person, I can confirm we’re pricks
I am pricks, kek

But wind/solar/water *together* on a large scale *is* sustainable
Oh ok then
Yeah, that’s true but still I think the benefits of renewable outweigh the disadvantages eg
Solar power is not made at night
Yeah I agree but there is still development to be had with renewable energy

A lot of brexiteers have a deep hatred for the EU
They cheer every problem that the EU faces, and are absolutely convinced that brexit is the first step on the road to the dissolution of the EU
There was lots of chat on ukpol about how the EU was a doomed project and how brexit would be the beginning of a complete unravelling
Because your comment was so classy to start with
That's by Ben Garrison, a Montanan (US) pro-Trump libertarian cartoonist
Why would i be salty
I wanted to remain, it was only when Cameron came back with fuck all before the brexit vote that i came to the conclusion that the eu will never change
It will always be a sloth in race with cheetahs
I mean look how weak and pathetic it is as a block, it needs american forces on its borders to deal with Russia, its a limp penis at an orgy
An orgy i wanted to be involved in
How was the UK the biggest factor against reform
I keep hearing this myth
yet we only voted against 2% of all reforms in the past 10 years or more
Which is why it will never change
Its in limbo all the time
It needs to say we are federalising and do it hard

My thoughts exactly
I think Austria should build a great big fence to stop all those filthy economic migrants from leaving Hungary and entering the civilized Western European nations
I've defended Trump on here against angry Europeans many times on issues of defence, trade etc

This really is a huge embarrassment to America
Denmark one of the biggest anglophile nations in Europe and one of the most committed nations of NATO, cancelling an audience with their queen is not acceptable in almost *any* circumstance

I was travelling with my mother today and saw a bus puff out some thick black smoke
It got me thinking about electric transport and subsequently electric trains
I think, if all of Europe worked together, we could make great strides towards developing not just a cleaner mode of mass transport, but a cheaper mode of mass transport between countries
It's a win-win and cheaper in the long term
Rights aren't things like "cheap train travel". Rights are inalienable that cannot be taken away, without force or authority being enacted over you, which is is usually authoritarian
A good example is the right to eat
You have a right to eat (the physical act of eating) , but not a right to something to eat, because that would require someone elses labour to create the food to provide it to you
A simple test of rights is to imagine yourself on a deserted island
How many of your "rights" do you still carry with you
If the right is no longer implementable without mandatory labour, it wasn't a right, it was your government trying to guarantee services to its citizens
I'm all for cheaper train travel, but when you declare something a right that isn't inalienable, you water down what a right is, and make it impossible to guarantee when things go south
I’m sure if you did this for the UK it would all be red
At least all of Europe can agree on something
Improved here from England

On that note, funnily enough, Vietnam actually does kinda see the US as a beacon of safety
Everyone thinks the Vietnam War was this big deal and that they must hate America forever, but for the Vietnamese, that's just a tiny blip in their 1000+ years of history with their bigger neighbour: China
The Vietnamese and China had their own war with each other as soon as the USA left, and that's just one war out of many that they've had throughout the millenia
Nowadays, Vietnam is one of the most pro-USA countries on earth
>Today, the Vietnamese view the U.S. in a positive light
About three-quarters of Vietnamese (76%) expressed a favorable opinion of the U.S. in a 2014 Pew Research Center survey
More highly educated people (89%) gave the U.S. especially high marks
Young people ages 18-29 were particularly affirmative (89%), but the U.S. is seen positively even by those who are old enough to have lived through the Vietnam War
Among those ages 50 and older, more than six-in-ten rated the U.S. favorably
They're entirely different countries and have dealt with things differently
God bless American Capitilism
>73% of Americans now agree there should be no such laws
That still means 1/6th of your country either believes that being homosexual should be illegal or that they *don't know if homosexuals deserve legal rights*
I'm honestly not sure which is worse
Sure, it's gotten *better*, but it's still fucking bad
They are
They're still European so yeah so there'll be similarities but that doesn't mean they have exactly the same opinions on everything
I've been to most Nordic / Scandinavian countries bar Finland and they're all about as similar as any other countries in Europe that are close
I generally just work with the rule that Left and Right is relative and depends on the local culture
Not to mention that in some places, what is considered progressive might be considered conservative elsewhere
Shit show started
Besides some airy fairy abstract idea of cooperation being good, multiculturalism has delivered a Europe of extremes
Just because Hitler = bad, it doesn't mean Europe hasn't fallen into the trap of complacency postwar
Ask the older residents of Calais, Malmö, Rotherham, or in the banlieus of Paris or Tower Hamlets what they think of the doctrines of state endorsed immigration and the ghetto friendly doctrine of multicultural
Or is every white person over the age of 50 in the places just a confirmed racist

Apparently so

Scotland isn't unique in that regard
Leaving the UK is a much more problematic issue than leaving the EU too
Rather foolish of her expecting riot police to be able to read

Palpatine literally got elected by the senate
The old Republic appears to have a parliamentary system
Palpatine was elected by the senate, not much different to how Boris was elected by the conservative party
Not
Yet
Why
This is clearer than any exposition I've read in any newspaper or heard on any radio or TV news
Thank you

Doesn't work
They need a king
> It's rather remarkable that it still operates in almost the same mechanism as it did back in 1776
it really doesn't though, especially not the senate or how voting works
>Imagine a Tory PM having to work with a Labour Parliament
well it sounds silly from our perspective in the UK but it's just a different system with different rules, ours is Parliamentary, theirs is Presidential
“Americans should only consider the opinions of people whose country has been under relative geopolitical stability in the last 30 - 100 years”
Yikes
People really need to separate governments from people in statements like the one above you tbh
But why should their vote count for less than someone else's? Everyone's vote should be worth the same amount
With the current system it means that people from States like New York and California aren't worth as much in terms of voting compared so some other states
Surely if one candidate has 60 million votes and the other has 50 million then the one with 60 million votes should be the president
With the current system it makes a lot of peoples votes redundant and results in situations where someone can have a lot more votes yet still lose which doesn't make a lot of sense to me
They also killed 2 members of golden dawn in a drive by too
Then they wonder why their own get's killed by them
It's even in the link it's as if reddits antifa autists can't or wont read

And for Covid apparently
Everyone's talking about the problems Scotland would face in this hypothetical situation whilst ignoring that you've just handed over Northern Ireland
They'd be plunged straight into civil war
Please don't
that England and Wales flag is awful
So Scotland having a hard border with it's biggest trading partner, 71% of all its trade goes there, even more goes through there, wont be an issue now
And the new Celtic Union of Ireland & Scotland should then pass Quebec style language laws to kick out/ban/supress English and the Anglos, and bring in Quebec style laws to favour, protect and bring Gaelic back as the new national language & culture of this new Celtic Union
I’m pretty sure a lot of people in N.Ireland would not be happy about this
England man bad
As if, the whole Celtic myth was blown out of the window long ago
Most Scots are divided between Lowland Scots who are basically Englishmen who migrated up North, and Highland Scots who are Northern Irishmen who migrated East
The Scottish,English and Welsh are more closely related to each other than the Irish although the Irish are like distant cousins
A more defined North-South divide
I'm in
Nooo please don’t leave us Scotland
Can you take the North of England too
feel like pure shit just want my kingdom back x
Celtic Union Of Broke
I like their flag though, hate ours, needs less Welsh
Good one, as if we would let wales be on the flag lol
r/me_ira
Hate to be pedantic, but it wouldn’t be called the United Kingdom of England and Wales
In terms of the union, England and Wales are a single entity
The United Kingdom refers to the island of Great Britain after being united by the union of England and Wales, and Scotland
No Scotland means no union so no United Kingdom
Irish + Scottish ... not sure we want the DUP on a grand scale
Ah yes, the
Celtic
Union of
Northern Ireland
The Republic of Ireland and
Scotland
Surely this is satire, nobody is mad enough to mix them two
Scotland is about as divided as Ireland between catholics and Protestants, except the Scots aren’t blowing each other up
It will only cause more trouble
I feel lile Northern Ireland would hate that
Do it
Yes
Great Britain is a landmass comprising England, Scotland and Wales
Ireland is an island comprising the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland
The United Kingdom is the soverign state of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
they can take the Isle of Wight with them, full of inbreds
People salty about brexit and can’t stop crying about it
I was about to just about to link /r/shitanericanssay before i saw your flair
Why are you bitter towards the English
And not the welsh, or more than 1 in 3 Scots who voted leave
> I like this idea on a personal level, but that's because of my current bitterness towards the English
Cant fault your honesty
So does England, not as much as Scotland
Remember that oil in the last few years bottomed out from $91 per barrel to $32 per barrel, and could do again at any time, also remember every year oil becomes closer to extinction as we move into other technologies
I'm not sure how Scotland can survive on one industry, that could be dead soon and can't be trusted for price variation
That's what the SNP did in 2014, all it's future predictions were at 2014 oil barrel prices, they then collapsed by 2/3 over night
Thats even more reason then
It's the last refuge where there aren't any, you mainlanders are a right bunch of interfamily lovers
> after Brexit I'm now one hundred in favor of Scottish independence
Too bad that the Scots are still only 45% in favour, and the SNP got annihilated in the post-Brexit election
England, England with knights, jousting, basically a real life game of thrones adaptation England
England with hundreds of different dialects and accents all with their own history (Norse, Saxon, Jutish)
England with all the castles and wars, kings and queens, literal fortresses in cities England
Can’t be, no culture, basically just USA wannabes
It wouldn't be called the "United Kingdom of" since there's no union
> Because it's mostly the English who are currently fucking it up
When I think Brexit I think Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage
Posh English pricks
And yet it was mainly the poor who voted for Brexit, not the rich
> I almost exclusively consume British media
Including for example James O'Brian's radio show
I'm a brexiteer, I like James O'Brian in general though, but he only ever seems to get the thickest twats on there to debate brexit with him
Like absolute idiots, if you don't know what you are talking about, why go on there
He always catches them out with questions like 'what EU laws don't you like
'...and they never have an answer
i could list fucking dozens
But no, he will get some thick cunt on instead
The other issue being of course is that Brexit is harmful, and you don't have a financial leg to stand on
But these rich people like James, who went to private school and is privileged, dont understand that it's not all about money to some of us
There is a reason that the have-nots voted for it in droves, and no it's not racism or xenophobia, it's because it wasn't working for them, so why keep it
"I hate the English so I consume English media to reinforce my hatred of those English cunts
Right
> Why blame that on the EU instead of your own incompetent politicians
Unless you believe the lies, you should know that your own government has a lot more effect on how your country functions than the EU
There are many things to blame our government for, but that does't mean the EU are not also to blame with some things
> Have you tried calling him
If you're so convinced you should test it out

We mostly left due to immigration concerns, as well as a deep alienation with the European project and as a protest vote against Westminster and Cameron's government
Can we have a brexit free day on this sub sometime soon
Pretty please

Nice 2012 meme, this is why we voted brexit, America can/will supply us with good memes
Referendum was near enough 50/50
We've been headed straight to destruction for the last two years
More and more people realising what's happening and changing their minds on it
May's deal is being shat on not because we think she can get better, but because the majority of the country now wants to stay in the EU
The country is under no delusion that we have *any* leverage over the EU, or that they owe us anything
Oh, is it back to being a trading bloc again
Isn't it funny that when we want to enter or leave, it's a trading bloc, and any other time, it's a political union and we're stupid for not realising it
We're not Americans
we don't use bandaids
>London as the financial center of Europe is no more
You're off your rocker
London is still the financial capital of the world
The only place on *earth* that is  equal is New York
No EU city even comes close, the only other one is Frankfurt at the tenth largest and then Luxembourg City and Paris at 21 and 23 respectively
Except it bullshit because the video
is cut and doesn't show what actually happened
We don't want concessions, hard brexit please, then ban all EU nations fishing our waters
No concessions

The interesting thing about Charlie Hebdo is it shows that if you criticise Islam you can lose your life but criticise Israel you can lose your job

While the attack was horrific, I wouldn't equate the magazine to secular values unless you value racism
Edit: I'm referring to Charlie hebdo

"Liberal" can mean "Liberal markets with little regulation" as well as "Liberal attitudes to abortion, pot and same-sex marriage". Some Conservative parties, like in the UK, support this, whilst at the same time opposing socially liberal values
In other words, let corporations do what they like, but don't let gay folk marry
B... but that would make your government eternally indecisive
If you only have 2 parties, one with a clear majority, your elected officials can actually exert there power and make decisions more freely

Question: why does a US president need to go to an EU summit
Did someone forget Biden’s booster seat
Does this count as an official state visit
We already know Biden comes with a shopping list for the EU - and a lot of what it is in it - a shopping list that the EU is going to laugh in his face over
This aint exactly going to end well
President President Biden now
Von der Leyen going to that seems strange, but I can understand Merkel going
But even then, VdL has some kind of power in Germany because Germany is an EU country, but Biden has no power there
It seems like sucking up to America tbh, and seems strange to me
Of course it’s necessary to have meetings with him, but I would have assumed that an EU summit should be about internal matters, so should only be attended by EU officials and EU heads of state
That seems logical to me
Agreed, but it seems a strange way to show it
I thought an EU summit would be internal matters, meaning no outside heads of state
I totally get the reason but it seems a strange time to do it

They are to be honest, the vast majority are pretty good people
The minority are however the ones that make the news
Most churches are heavily invested into the local charity scene, almost every homeless shelter in my city is based out of churches and they provide things like soup kitchens, charity drives etc heavily
I've known a few priests and vicars and they've all been really kind people and completely accepting people
The minority abuse this power yes, there are certainly problems with the churches in some places
America has a bigger problem with for profit churches and so on but in my experience in the UK churches, mosques, temples etc and religion in general are absolutely a net good for the population
I don't believe in God, but his servants are certainly on the whole good

Quite frankly with this world cup victory
France are the best team ever at Russia 2018, They're the most brutal and vicious, and most ruthless champion there's ever been
There's no one that can stop them
Croatia is a conqueror
No, France is Alexander, Croatia they're no Alexander
France is the best ever at this world cup
There's never been anybody as ruthless as the French
They're Sonny Liston, They're Jack Dempsey
There's no one like France 2018
They're from their cloth
There's no one that can match them
Their style is impetuous, they're attack unstoppable, their defense is impregnable
And the French they are just ferocious
, They wanted Croatia's heart
They wanted to eat Croatia's children
Praise be to Deschamps
Anyhow for real congrats France
Its scary how young they are, they have to be favourites for Euro 2020 and Qatar 2022(when most of these players will be in their prime)
France are in a great position to dominate world football for a long time yet
At the start ot the match, the French team shouldve came outta the tunnel wearing berets, exactly like in the same way the French rugby team Racing 92 did for the Champions Cup final earlier this year
I cant help but think England wouldve provided France a much tougher game and England wouldve been a much more dangerous opponent for the French imo
Also people keep saying Croatia were the better team
But were they really
I dont think so
I mean lets be honest here
At this level Croatia have been utterly unworthy of a world cup final and, given their dismal, truly shite showings against Denmark, Russia and in the first half of the match against England(a match which England shouldve had won by halftime
But Croatia were only kept in it by some awful reffeering and getting away with countless fouls on England, very dirty), were bloody lucky to be there at all
Croatia are and indeed were very beatable, they are not that good
As France demonstrated today
Also Croatia's nasty Anglophobia really put me off them
I could never support them after how they acted after beating England in the semis
They turnt away many ppl who otherwise might have supported them
Haha :D I was trying to work out the French :D Took a while to realise it's Irish :D
As if that’s a flex
Unlucky Ireland, your turn to deal with the frogs now

Yes we did and I’m ashamed of our atrocities but that is no reason to involve innocent people such as this man and I assume his child and endanger or even take their lives, as was the case with the photographer
And as for the Americans that blindly follow them, probably only because you’re a “proud Irishman” because some distant relative moved to America from Ireland at a young age - grow up

>Don't lead the UK into destroying the Good Friday Agreement
Hello there mate
Can you explain exactly how the UK would be destroying the Good Friday Agreement by leaving the EU
Or do what they did in Warrington and place two bombs at either end of a street, detonate one first, send people running in the direction of the second and detonate that one and kill two children in the process
I was against this when I first heard this but if there are multiple high level members of the party actually sanctioning murders, theft and assassinations then that's not a party anymore, that's a criminal gang
If they were going to commit crimes, they should have done what the Nazis did which is create a paramilitary wing that the main party can deny responsibility for while keeping the political party legally clean
Greek fascist party being labeled a criminal organisation
I mean you're Greek, so you'd know more about Golden Dawn than I do, but that's why whenever you want to install a fascist government, you usually want to separate your political party (with a clean image, and moderate politicians) from your paramilitary group (who can intimidate opponents and do a lot of ground work)
You have to ensure the politicians constantly denounce the work of the paramilitary group even when it works in your favor
but even with the SturmAbteilung (who were the paramilitary group for the Nazis), they had to eventually purge them as well in the Night of the Long Knives and absorbed them under Heydrich and Himmler in the SS
Our negotiators failed so now our trained gull squadrons are reclaiming the UK's fish one at a time
I bet French air traffic controllers are livid right now knowing no one would care if they went on strike
So for anyone interested there is a guy called Gary Raikes who began a political party called the New British Union which is a revival of Sir Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists
It's an interesting read because the party is very openly fascist and has strong links to the British Nationalist Party and Britain First, both of which are very far right
I was quite surprised that they actually have a website too and are very open about their fascist views and it's an interesting read (I'm not advocating for them, I just find it interesting)
This is how the English deal with Fascists

Ahhh another ‘sort by controversial’ kind of thread
Well I’m sorry I don’t see Stalin, a mass murdering genocidal dictator, as representing all communist thought in the 21st century
Clearly a regime that made it criminal to be a homosexual and banned workers demonstrating is actually representative of a movement for equal rights for all and the emancipation of workers
Some smaller shops in the UK get twitchy when you hand them a £20 note, I can’t imagine what would happen if you handed them a 500
well I can and it’d look a lot like a stroke
I lost £10s and £20s before, pulling them out of my pocket accidentally, dropping them etc and you are always furious
imagine losing a €500

The EU doesnt have the bottle to kick the UK out, not in a million years
You're right but the US, UK and Australia (basically the anglosphere) have fully drank the neoliberal koolaid
I'd happily see a return to social democracy in the UK
Well it's based off the asset owning class (middle class) and the non asset owning class (working class)
That's how it's defined in the UK anyway
Or to use left wing terms the bourgeoisie and the proletariat
the balls, the nerve, the backbone
Grrrrr

But that's the funny part everyone forgets, the US government already spends *trillions* of USD on Medicare and Medicaid

You're European tho

U.K. should be higher

Kinda depressing at no point did anyone think the UK helped at all
I won't lie, it irks me how much credit the US gets, comparatively to the UK, what with FDR's laissez faire attitude to fascism in Europe until 1942
It is highly likely the allies would have lost without the US but to come in so late and reap the 'glory' is something of a sore point for most historically minded Brits
It's interesting because there's really no right answer
Who did they ask
Americans
They do realise that Britain was the only reason D-Day was possible
The battle of Britain maintained our inependence, our Navy secured the Channel, our spies organised the resistance, our landing craft got men on the beaches, and our meteorologist gave the window that caught out the Nazis
Britain almost did *more* for D-day than the US

Two dead in knife attack in French church, official says terrorism suspected

Absolutely horrid
I’m angered so much by this, my condolences to the families of the victims
>French government, who at its very core are secular, projects cartoons onto building of Muhammad
>Islamic extremists attack Church in response, an organisation that is totally separate from the French government by law for nearly 300 years, had nothing to do with the cartoons, and is by nature completely non-secular
Just shows how senseless these attacks are, if they were really revenge specifically against Macron, government officials would be targeted, not a (presumably) Christian civilian
Seems worrying like it’s a revenge against France as a people, not just a state
Sadly the UK and Germany aren't far behind France in this matter
UK government so chickenshit to do anything from fear of muslim backlash and civil uproar
Instead they continue to let this bubble up behind the scenes

Former Prime minister of Malaysia
>Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past
Are you able to remove the wholesome rewards
only the "far right" can save us now
Just because the extremists and the islamists haven't been triggered to show their faces in the UK doesn't mean they don't exist
Now just under 10% of UK schools are Islamic religious schools and will continue to grow, there's entire mosques and communities that are slowly getting worse and worse and preaching islamist text
At least in France they have cracked down on these mosques
UK government and the intelligence agencies are quite literally chickenshit to do anything about it
Not to mention more children are interested in islamic extremism than ever before, I wonder where they get this idea from
I've noticed so many idiotic American comments on this thread, i guess its election season still
Look at all the majority islamic countries and then look at western Europe
They are polar opposites, in both freedom of speech, secularism, democracy (basically all western values), but you think it's a good idea to take in thousands of these people from this culture, let them live in secluded communities, in secluded islamic schools
Are you seriously telling me this is a good idea
Or are you brainwashed

Shaquiri looks shorter than his billed height of 5'7
I know most professional sports lie about these things, often claiming players are 2, 3 to 4 inches taller than they actually are
Tbh I get the impression Shaquiri probably doesnt even like and doesnt eat Swiss food/cheese
He's Albanian/Kosovan so i doubt Swiss cuisine is one he enjoys, and it seems generally from reading his various comments over the years and his actions etc that he doesnt feel very Swiss and doesnt identify with Swiss culture either etc
I think Switzerland is merely a means to end for him, its not where his heart truly is, its more so a career choice than one he truly feels passionate about
Just using Switzerland basically

You can call a woman handsome in English, but it sounds old-fashioned and some people who are uptight about gender roles will be insulted
Some women would take it as more of a compliment than being called pretty though
Calling a man beautiful is rarer, but when I've seen it done, they usually imply 'inner beauty'.
Beautiful is more universal than pretty because it is often applied to intangible things like music
Handsome and pretty are more associated with what people look like, so I've seen men described as pretty more often than I've seen them described as beautiful

If bees and butterflies went extinct most likely we would use forced repopulation or replace them with robot pollinators
Still sad though, it’s funny how the very fruits and veg they stock in Tesco is a big reason why the pollinators are dying off, agricultural farming and the chemical runoff
Are you sure Mr Beast didn’t buy it
There's tescos in Slovakia
TIL
If those bugs were to actually die off it could possibly cause a knock-on extinction event meaning governments and international organisations would definitely get involved in methods of saving or replacing pollinators

All he had to do was say 'it's been nearly a year and I haven't seen my girlfriend and I miss her' and you'd have some sympathy, this is just stupid lmao
Yeah that's more damning, I'm gonna imagine he isn't the type to be fully isolating and getting everything delivered
If he was then I'd probably forgive him but yeah
not good
Honestly if that is the case then I don't think he's that bad if literally all he did was go to see his girlfriend and nobody else was involved as long as she did the same
It's the people who go to house parties every week that are fucking us over and stopping people like him who don't go into public from seeing loved ones
It's pretty shite for our mental health and seeing a girlfriend once every few months is gonna help keep that in check
Yeah that's why I said as long as she did the same
The only person I've been seeing is my girlfriend, granted she lives in the same country and not far away enough that I'd risk seeing other people but I get his predicament, it must suck
But Christ he could have just said 'I miss her' instead of making shit up lol
I agree but given his lifestyle I don't think it's *too* bad
Yeah you're right with that one, makes no sense at all
Don't worry about it my friend, shitty times makes for shitty mental state

The forward-facing guns of HMS Belfast on the River Thames are positioned to score a direct hit on a motorway service station at Scratchwood
If the six-inch guns, which can fire eight rounds per minute, were loaded with 112lb shells, they could obliterate the motorway cafe and toilet stop in seconds
I'm consistently amazed at the thousand year history of almost constant warfare between our disparate nations
And yet we're still neighbours, peace has reigned for an unprecedented amount of time now between our proud, fractious states
A lot of our cultures may be lost on outsiders, but this history is \*ancient\*. How proud I am of how far we've come, how grateful I am that I don't have to be conscripted into dying in some desperate field in the France every other generation
How can we throw this away, fellow brits
Forgive my sentimentalism
My friends often call me alarmist, but the right wing insurgence across Europe and most infamously in my own country, not only gives me a great deal of concern - but almost depression
How can we waste this opportunity
Lasting peace in a continent that for millennia that has only known war
The mere mention of fractious sentiment should be given the elevation it deserves - it is backwards
It is a throwback of what once was
How thankful I am that much our previous mutual hatred and rivarly has turned into essentially a meme - something we can sincerely poke fun at
Its not a bad thing, humour is the ultimate healer
I now feel like I have more in-common with the various Europeans I've been lucky to become close friends with than many of my own countrymen
How often has that ever been a possibility
I care not much for the political institutions of the EU, but for its foundational ideals and the people that populate it
This is the first chance of many, many generations to founder European brotherhood
It's so fragile right now
Perhaps since it's first inception it was only a fools hope
I can only hope that we will see no major conflict within Europe within my lifetime
This is one explanation from londonis
com:
"But why this target in particular
It has nothing to do with the exorbitant price of its cappuccinos
The imperilled service station sits neatly on the radius of the guns' comfortable range (about 18
5 km at 45º elevation, but the artillery could stretch to 23 km if pushed)
A point anywhere within that band might have been chosen for the resting formation of the six forward guns
According to the ship's Chief Yeoman, Kevin Price, Scratchwood was picked on because it was a well-known landmark on the M1 motorway
"We could also hit Cheshunt, or Gidea Park, or fall just shy of Dartford," he tells us
Scratchwood, though, has a certain quotidian monotony that invites comparison with Betjeman's "come friendly bombs" prejudice
The targeting was decided as long ago as 1971
This was the year HMS Belfast was first moored in the Pool of London to serve as a museum ship, following decades of distinguished service as one of the Royal Navy's most powerful light cruisers
It goes without saying that the Belfast would never have cause to bombard the motorway — but the guns had to point somewhere, and targeting a famously humdrum location could only help with press and popular attention
HMS Belfast is operated by Imperial War Museum and is open daily to the public

It has a sense of grandeur and neatness which looks pretty great, but to me the grids are also a symbol of autocracy and imposed order
To rebuild a city means to order everyone living in it to give up their property and build over it
After the Great Fire of London the King wanted to implement a similar plan for the City
However, one big thing stopped him: the rights of the people
Families owned the land, the shops and houses, and they began rebuilding after the fire based on the old medieval road layout
The King in England didn't have the power nor the money to force enough people to give up their land and build a grid on top as in Catholic Europe, so London kept its curves and bends and side streets
It means it's arguably a more ugly city compared to these beautifully laid out grids, but it's historical and interesting to see

Apart from the otjer comment, basically its a tall bridge built over the tyne thats been here for 90 years
From spring to late summer theres a massive nest of kittiwakes that look cool and natural and stuff but then you see the path under the bridge which has an ungodly level of birdshit on it
Honestly the tyne bridge is not one of the nicest parts of town, theres a big long road called dean street which leads to underneath the bridge which is famous for its georgian architecture n stuff, which is much nicer
....and more castles in the area than any other part of England
Also the place where the lifeboat, windscreen wipers and lucozade was invented
Also the end point of Hadrians Wall
Newcastle is a great city
To be fair there are nice bits
Dean street's georgian architecture is apparently famous (even if the shops you encounter go from a posh steakhouse and a big theater to a shite KFC ripoff and a brewdog)
There’s some great ones not too far from me, personal favourites are Barton in the Beans and Stretton en le Field

Well yes
It's what I expected .
There are around 200 countries in the world, nearly all of them are not in the EU, the UK will be fine
Worth it
In the theoretical world where Ireland unites and Scotland remains, it would likely still be called the United Kingdom of Great Britain
In fact, even if Scotland left it would probably be the United Kingdom of England and Wales

...we've done as many trade deals with non eu countries in 2 years as the EU has in
I see us more as a switzerland, or maybe Iceland
you're over it get lost
And how about France, Italy, Spain
the other large EU countries
Yes
rolled them over, added a few bits to a few deals, such as Japan
and dont pay into the EU
so better deals
I was told by this subreddit deals wouldn't be rolled over, other nations would cut the weak Brits apart and we would become chicken feed
We are too weak alone
Etc etc etc
....we've got the same deals, without paying into the EU
Win
If we hadn't negotiated anything, we wouldn't still have the same deals would we
Near the top it is labelled, but what about iceland
Lol yea I realised that, now I feel silly, was about to stealth edit my comment as well
You cant dish out and not take it
You realised we just let ourselves out of the €750 billion EU covid recovery fund right
How much did that save us
....and now we dont pay into the EU and have the same deal
WIN
No, I'm opening up the fact that had we remained
we would have likely paid 20% of that €750 billion over the years
No, its like going to Tesco, paying for it, leaving
With the EU countries, its like going  to Tesco everyday, paying for it everyday, then leaving
Since EU countries still have to pay into the pot every day, the UK doesnt
Just like €760 billion EU covid recovery fund, we are not part of it
every EU countey now has to pay a share of that
because inside the EU you pay every year, there are no club card points
You pay a yearly membership to get the benefits of EU trade deals
The UK now gets those same trade deals
but doesn't have to pay a yearly membership
....but EU countries still pay into the EU every year to keep those deals
The UKndoesnt pay into the EU and still keeps those deals
So therefore the UK has a better deal
same as the EU without the cost
We've already signed some lermanant ones
like Japan
which is better than the EUs
We took the EU deal, added some favourable stuff for both of us
then signed it
Easy when you dont have 28 chefs on 1 side
So just going to completely ignore the fact the deal
went further on data, finance etc
...and is euronews now an unbiased source, is it
Borderlex
who's owner is Iana Dreyer
the anti Brexit woman who is always on TV here

Not
Same deal
dont pay billions into the EU
Win
...no, the fact that's she's on TV here all the time moaning about brexit
is why she's anti brexit
Fullfact didnt come to the same conclusion did they
The EU pays yearly for the deal
The UK doesnt
Why

He had to go, you can’t have a prime minister that campaigned and voted remain, in a country that voted to leave
He lost the referendum and his political career was done
The mistake they made was putting another person that campaigned and voted remain in his place
Nope
That was all we were even going to get from a deal given the red lines we presented
Nope the leave campaigners never left
Both Boris, Gove and Leadsom (the three most prominent conservative front-bench leave campaigners) put their names foward in the conservative elections after Cameron resigned
It was between Boris, Leadsom and May as the final three with Boris and May equal on MP's. Gove then backstabbed boris and took half of his MP's to try and clinch the leader spot
It failed massively, and the final two were Leadsom and May
All the remain MP's voted for May and Leadsom lost support due to the Gove betrayal and the news that she was against Gay Marriage and Abortion
So I think it's fair to say they didn't disappear
Boris was FS in May's cabinet for a while, Leadsom, Gove and Javid all hold positions along with other leave campaigners
It's not that they've gone away, it's the fact that they haven't been able to get into power
Well Leadsom withdrew because she had only 66 MP’s on her side compared to over 130 May had
Gove backstabbed Boris and so ended Boris’s chance of ever gaining enough seats
A lot of Gove MP’s voted for May rather than Leadsom but if it were Boris in the final two and he didn’t get backstabbed he could have possibly taken Leadsom’s, Gove’s and possibly some May MP’s who didn’t like Leadsom’s views
Boris wanted PM, he got backstabbed by a power hungry Gove
Yeah I said the mistake they made was putting another Remain campaigner as PM
I read an interesting article that talked about Cameron’s logic for holding it
The main reason was to stop the leakage of voters and MP’s to UKIP
It was the belief at the time that the referendum would kill UKIP as a party, which would prevent what has happened in European politics where the right wing populist eurosceptic parties have become the opposition
This would kill the Conservative party like it has done in France, Netherlands, Poland and Germany
It was also because of the fact he is a gambler, he has gambled with referenda before by allowing a Scottish vote of independence, which would also have devastating consequences for the UK
He gambled twice, nearly lost the first time for what was expected and lost the second
Both times he thought he would win easily
He also never expected life long friend Michael Gove to backstab and campaign for leave
Also Boris betrayed Cameron and campaigned for leave even though he tried to whip his party into supporting the governments Remain position
He has never spoken to Gove and Boris since and both MP’s have shown their true colours
Just power hungry narcissists
Yes I completely agree but the 2008 global recession was the cause for it
The UK is very reliant on its financial sector, which is the most badly hit by the financial crash
Austerity hasn't helped but its definetly the recession that has triggered the riots and the subsequent fall in the living standards, stagnation of wages and lack of economic growth
Recessions have been heavily linked in the past 200 years to political instability, scapegoating, rioting, more extremist views and a lack of faith in the political system
Austerity has caused a further strain in public services which wasn't needed after a recession in my opinion
It was partly for that too, but the EU didn’t get him a major deal or reform that the country was asking for
The main reform we wanted was optional freedom of movement between member countries, the EU didn’t delve into that idea at all
Also we tried to advocate for a slashing of EU red tape and a rearrangement of CAP and CFP
He wanted a serious discussion for a reformed EU that focuses on sovereignty and the EU budget discussion would have more thought in Britain (its second biggest contributor)
He also wanted an updated EU budget and policy that doesn’t recognise that the euro is the single currency in the union but that the Sterling and other smaller currencies should also be considered in the budget planning
All that Cameron got back was he was allowed to put a brake on benefits for migrants and a lot of vague promises
EU reform deal: What Cameron wanted and what he got
Well everyone knows in the commons that Gove and Boris hate each other and haven’t spoken since
We made it
Happy New Year :)

[Adolf Hitler in 1942 talking in his normal, everyday voice to Finnish military commander Mannerheim
talking about the invasion, setbacks, mistakes & problems regarding the invasion of the Soviet Union and basically somewhat admitting tha the tide of the war is changing against Germany and that they're screwed, Germany cant win and also revealing his(Hitler's) thought processes, what he was thinking at the time
Iirc after the holocaust werent most returning Slavic Jews/Eastern European Jews still attacked, rounded up and killed, and or banned from getting their now stolen homes and business back etc by the various non-jewish slav populace and the governments of these Eastern European countries
The violent, rampant anti-semitism wasnt just a Nazi thing
It was always there before and after the Nazi occupations/holocaust
No there’s speculation that Himler was involved because of a conversation someone overheard when Heydrich was in hospital but it’s all speculation
The belarus one looks like the guy is posing as himself each election

What do the French know about coffee anyway
> British coffee is the worst I had, tasted of raw sewage
How does this work
Most of our coffee is from Costa/Starbucks/Nero etc
don't they import from the same vendors in South/Central America as every other country
What I'm saying is, none of the coffee is from Europe, so how does an Americano in London taste vastly different from an Americano in Sweden
I'm assuming they're sent here for zoos
I'm not aware of wild camels wandering about
Never heard of the Fridays, north east
We do NOT have mayonnaise with fish and chips in Sussex
I believe this is all the evidence we need to emancipate the north from the south
Clearly there is a split and differences too great to get over
Wasn’t there a website that can basically pin point what region of the UK you’re from based on what words you use
I can’t remember the name of it but it guessed me by my use of the word daps for plimsole shoes and also that I call wood lice ‘billy bakers’.
If you call it a “batch” or a “barm cake” you should be imprisoned
What dirty bastard has Mayo with fish and chips
I live in the grey area and ive never heard of the other Friday names in my life
My mum was from the north when she was young
She does not have an accent anymore but she pronounces ‘oo’ words as ‘u’
That data is hilariously wrong for Northamptonshire
It is not a county that is South
I love how half of these are just north vs south with extra steps
MAYONNAISE
That's possibly the most dull thing you could cover your chips in
You forgot “Technically has an Independence Day” vs “no Independence Day”
If in Norfolk you see someone eating mushy peas with fish and chips they're getting a slap
This is surprisingly accurate
I’m in West Yorkshire and every one is correct for me except bottom left - I have curry sauce with fish and chips instead of mushy peas, although mushy peas are nice
Live in Somerset, top 3 are wrong, happy to see one i agree with - I do like Chips with mayonnaise :)
I’m from that small pink area that calls a small loa of bread a batch
It was completely new to me when I joined the army and realised not everyone called it a sausage batch
I was looked at a few times in a very puzzling way but more often that not they received a just as puzzled look back
Hey newcastle should be gravy with chips
(Except i prefer curry anyway lol)
Disgusting people putting mayonnaise on chips filthy fuckers
This comment 2was made by the Chips peas and gravy gang
Mayonnaise must be Tartar sauce, right
I've lived in the north for half my life and the south for half my life and while I do alternate how I say some words I will NEVER pronounce it grARSs instead of grass
Supper is what you have after the main evening meal, at least that's what my nan always calls it
Haha yeah, also chiggy pigs for Devon
From the south and no one has mayonnaise I know of but every one has curry sauce
It’s delicious
We even get it when ordering Chinese takeaway
...and no mention of tartar sauce
Your outrage made me laugh and I can confirm I occasionally do but not often
It helps that's also where most the jobs are
It's for the best we save the north for a surprise when you visit
it's the best thing to go with chips, other than salt and vinegar :)
They must mean Tartar sauce, surely
Don't forget to brush your teethe
It's not like the liquid from an actual curry like a tikka masala, it's more of a lightly spiced gravy
And it's absolutely banging
>and Boris Johnson
[You mean the comedian, Boris Johnson
Mate we have nothing, the east have Brighton
You don't sign anything

Ireland and form a Celtic superstate and sneak back into the EU
I have mayo :(
I'm in Devon and I have mayo on my chips, and either ketchup or mayo on fish & chips
Gotta get down on Friday
haven't had tartar sauce in years
I'd forgotten about that
Thanks for the reminder
Definitely good with fish and chips :)
Ahh fuck
Lol is this a joke

Freight services used to go through England but are now being rerouted due to Brexit
Brexit had very little to do with race and a lot more to do with a general sense of a country just wanting to be in control of what laws she made
(FWIW, I’m English and voted Remain - anything for a quiet life - but it’s basically slander to say Brexit was predicated on racism
((Also, UK is more multi-racial than most other EU countries anyway, so who would it be racist against
White people
Protests aren’t mob rule, are they
They’re part of democracy
I mean, we’re two Remainers (possibly of varying levels of commitment) second-guessing what was in the hearts of (what was it
) 37% of the voting public in 2016
I think we can probably agree that this Herculean task is likely to be beyond us
For the good of my sanity, I choose to believe that it wasn’t necessarily about *who* came - different or indistinguishable - so much as just the sheer volumes, which (taken with all other immigration) did increase our population by ten million from 1997 to now
(Compared to a 2 million rise between 1974 and 1997
)  That is ***A Lot***.   And we weren’t prepared
And I think some communities suffered for it
I can see why those communities might want to stem it however they could
And I do think as well that there’s something rather commendable about people wanting their democracy to be local and direct (rather than feeling incredibly remote and absolutely beyond their control and largely unaccountable as it’s hard to deny that it does with decisions taken in Brussels - I mean, amongst other things, Brexit is a vote for the efficacy of the Poll Tax Riots, no
Re: economics - who knows, frankly
All seems a bit moot now that we’ve spunked a WWII amount up the wall trying to contain Covid for six months

So glad I'm soon to receive my Swedish citizenship
Can retain my UK citizenship and EU citizenship whilst avoiding the fuckery of Brexit
Good luck UK, you're gonna need it lol
And we could’ve spent that money fighting climate change or poverty
The whole thing has been a mess
First people vote for Brexit without understanding what it meant besides leaving the EU, then they fire off Article 50 without actually having a plan, and then they keep requesting extensions because they somehow haven't planned anything and decided they want to deal with it after we've already left
Businesses are closing down, larger businesses are taking their business elsewhere, unemployment is on the rise, the cost of living is increasing sharply without salaries across the country matching those requirements, housing is being bought by dodgy Chinese and Russian businessmen so homelessness is on the rise too
All this for what, so our kid's kids can have a good future
What about me
I'm 25 and now I'll never be able to retire whilst overworking in my future just to eat
Fuck the future generations, they should have been looking out for current generations
It wasn't their job to look out for them
To be completely fair though, the the £203 billion expected cost of Brexit is also not a black hole
The lack of investment into the infrastructure and people of the country will continue to produce worse returns, poorer lives and bleaker economies for many generations
**sigh**
It was not about the money but also (mostly) not about xenophobia either
Lets not keep peddling the motion that 52% of Brits are fundamentally racist

All you had to do is bet on the £ buy buying pretty much anything
Buy shares in a UK company
Majority of the FTSE sells abroad, so any weakening in the £ increases profits
Invest in oil, gold
Everything trades in $, a weaker £ means a greater return
It's no coincidence that every major No Dealer is a rich stockbroker type
The harder the Brexit, the weaker the £, the greater the profit
Rees-Mogg made £10mil just in one day - the day his mate announced the pro-rog of the UK parliament
Guy Verhofstadt has stated that a European empire is the only way to defend Britain’s “way of life” in the 21st century
Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, the euro-federalist said: “The world of tomorrow is a world of empires, in which we Europeans and you British can only defend your interests, your way of life by doing it together in a European framework and a European Union
The EU is a federalist monster held together by a network of dodgy Eurocrats, they’d happily slice up the UK, Scotland, Norn Iron and all her liberty
They make their intentions very clear
No we won’t be assimilated into an empire regardless, the UK is the 5th most powerful economy on earth, not everyone is so willing t’ kneel to foreign empires, no matter how beneficial to our economy they may be
The right to self-determination is hard and easy to take for granted
That one MEP just so happens to be the EUs top Brexit Negotiator, id say he’s very representative of the EUs ambitions
No, the UK will still be 5th after Brexit, we will definitely suffer economically for a short while but not even close to as severe as you’re predicting
You really don’t think the United Kingdom couldn’t possibly survive without being consumed by one empire or another
And even so, you’d so easily surrender your self-determination
The fact that he’s the top Brexit Negotiator actually does matter a lot and does reflect the views of other EU leaders, as they put him in that position
Does the prime-minister not reflect the attitude of the government as a whole, simply because it’s one man
Brexit has never about the EU in it’s current state, it’s about it’s future one
It’s grip gets tighter each year, if it’s this hard to leave now, imagine 10 years down the line

A political party selects their leader, the people vote for the political party

More younger people not being educated
Not every German was a Nazi, but the mass killings were generally known (especially in the Wehrmacht) and tolerated, even if the "death camp" portion of the holocaust was only revealed at the end of the war
On the other hand, it's not just Germans who were guilty
The ordinary people of lots of countries (Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Romania stand out) massacred their local Jews before the German soldiers even arrived
But it seems everybody tries to push the blame entirely onto the Nazi leadership and the SS, forgetting that it takes much more cooperation than that to exterminate 11 million people
>And what use does it have that a Wehrmacht Soldier knew it
My Great-Grandfather was not at home for the entirety of the war
Full 6 years
When he was wounded he was sent for a year to do guard duty in France, to then being sent back to the eastern front
He was completely unable to send any letters from 43 on
They just stopped to arrive
And even before his letters were censored and full of generic phrases
His wife was getting the information that he is alive in 46
3 Years not a word
And even if he had found a way: i'm quite sure a soldier fighting for years is the wrong person to ask what is wrong or right
I doubt he saw in those people anything else then the enemy
My point is that you can't delineate into "Nazis committed the crimes" as if the "Nazis" are separate from the ordinary people or soldiers - thousands of regular members of the army committed innumerable crimes against civilians on the Eastern Front
Conversations secretly recorded between POWs make it clear that a hell of a lot of soldiers on that front, maybe even the majority, personally participated in them
Certainly if your great-grandfather spent most of the war in the East, he would have at least witnessed it in some form (especially in the scorched earth retreat)
How it was justified by the soldiers at the time, suppressing partisan activity or whatever, is irrelevant now
I don't think you can call that kind of historical honesty "playing the blame game". Actually this information was suppressed for far too long
Most people not just in Germany but other countries in the West have fooled themselves into thinking the common soldier did not take part in atrocities, it is simply incorrect
These people, along with thousands of members of the Nazi party, occupied prominent positions in German society after the war with no reckoning whatsoever
Look at the example of Kurt Waldheim, he approved propaganda leaflets encouraging citizens to kill Jews, and became the leader of the UN
Do you think his past actions would have been revealed if he was some simple business leader
Of course not
Because there were hundreds and thousands of men with similar stories who were allowed to continue their lives after the war
*Not enough* people were blamed, the vast majority of war criminals who survived returned home and built the Germany we see today
While I don't doubt the good intentions of German people today, it's also true that Germany was never truly denazified
>You talk about hundreds of thousands that should have been persecuted and hanged
I think the more then 2 million civilians that died while being forced out of their former homes should be enough to satisfy any kind of blood thirst
And if not: even more were beaten, raped and lost everything they had
Thankfully the US took another way then spinning this never-ending circle of revenge
I don't think people should have been hanged en masse
But I also don't think Germany was forced to reckon with the war until so many of the people who committed the crimes were already dead
The allies wanted to rebuild a strong Germany to counter the Soviets, so they needed the men and reduced their de-Nazification accordingly - that's a fact
It's really extraordinary that within five years of a war which, had it been won by Germany, would have resulted in the extermination of most of the people of Europe, the Allies were willing to forgive and move on
And even give huge loans to the perpetrators to rebuild their economy into a powerhouse
What I'm trying to say is that there's somewhere between "hanging" and "no punishment at all". And in this case, relative to the participation of the populace in a war of racial extermination, they got off pretty lightly
As for your other point, I apologise if I misinterpreted your argument, it sounded like you were upset at the way people were blaming "Germany" or "Germans" for the actions of the Nazis, I was just trying to point out that the distinction isn't really useful and isn't clear even now, partly because of the lack of de-Nazification I pointed out above
I was rebutting this specifically:
>But i also think generalization is growing and nobody really cares for details anymore
I have especially the feeling nobody cares anymore that not every German was is/a Nazi and that it may be a extreme insult to throw everyone into one pot with some of the most murderous people in history

Makes me so depressed to think how much we have eroded our trust on the continent with Brexit
Is this a trick to get the French to lower their defences so they don’t have to go through Belgium this time
Honestly I'm just happy we're not as bad as America or Russia
How do they feel about China
Do we have UK numbers pre and post Brexit
I live in Great Britain and honestly
I don't blame you
So they distrust the countries they couldnt defeat in WW2 compaired to the country they did
Germans sharing their opinion on who they think are trustworthy
That’s gotta be the irony peak of the week
Well the bottom three invaded their country
>I still rate the US higher then Russia, but not by much
No need to read any further
What a ridiculous statement
If that ridiculous view was more mainstream it's possible the US would leave Europe, and there would be a lot of lessons learned
Luckily for Europe most Europeans aren't stuck in a weird 19th century eurocentric mentality where they think that Europe can dominate the rest of the world, and are well aware that he who allies with America is he who wins
No one could ever dislike the EU if they were provided FACTS and CRITICAL THINKING LESSONS
You don’t think Germany spies on allied countries for information
Seriously
&!!!!! Every country does mate, we spy on America too
BRITSH POLL: 82% consider Germany an extremely close ally, 7% dont
74% think Germany does an amazing job at human rights, 10% don’t. Nice to see the Germans don’t trust us though
Germans aren’t known for their intelligence in Europe mate, can’t lose two world wars without having something wrong in your head
Someone posted the graph going back to 2013 and tbh it's not *that* much of a difference
It’s all just flip flop numbers anyway
This isn’t deep rooted trust and relationships like the one we have with our Anglosphere brothers
If Le Pen got elected and immediately took France out of the EU like she said she would, France would be looking at numbers similar to ours
You don’t ruin Europe three times in a row (Protestant reformation, WW1, WW2) and not have some sort of drilled in intrinsic power hungry complex deeply rooted into you
Lol
The Europeans have never trusted us mate, stop being so soppy, besides the smaller countries the bigger and more influential European countries have ALWAYS despised us, and it’s quite evident why, if leaving the EU is a precedent for “no longer trusting us” then it speaks volumes on what the EU actually is
Europeans didn’t care for us when we were in the EU and they don’t care now, we have much closer alliances around the world that we can capitalise on
How does America get that joke, you don’t holiday with us
When they invaded Poland
The most justified invasion in the history of invasions, perhaps ever
> The USA has high ideals about personal freedom and freedom in gerneral, a good humor and most of their people are chilled and just want to life a good life
Hello fellow GeRMaN
I completely agree
I’ve always considered Australia (obviously) NZ, Canada and France to be way closer allies to us than the USA
Sad my government tries to push a pathetically embarrassing relationship with the US where we dismiss some of our closest allies in an attempt to be seen as America’s lapdog
Thinking the US actually gives a damn about us, it’s all just sad
>Somebody who likes trade wars, something Germany is deeply opposed to,
With a currency massively devalued by the poor nations of the Eurozone
Good guy Germany
Lmfao
What a shock
England bad
Sure man, keep telling yourself that
>treaties
Strictly speaking, no treaty even existed
The Senate rejected Obama's treaty, told him that it was non-binding and that a future successor could just undo it because it had no legal standing, and Obama still paraded it around as a victory and claiming it worked, only for the exact scenario the Senate warned him about to unfold
Yes the country that sacrificed their entire empirical GDP to stop slavery, the country that sacrificed their entire GDP to join two world wars to ensure the balance of power in Europe never swung, the country that sacrificed their entire GDP to ensure little countries will have their freedom and sovereignty against tyrannical European countries and we fought and died for that
If we really were a money grabbing country we would’ve just war profiteered, built up our navy, remained uninvadable and sold to both sides like America
When a company getting fined contributes more to the EU than a good portion of the member states

I'd want Scotland back, for all its awful weather, over that bit of Spain you've given us
Not because it isn't a nice bit of Spain, but if we controlled that much of Andalusia, we'd mess it up even more than we already do
My life wouldn't massively change though
edit: I suppose if you wanted to offend me, you should've put the Isle of Wight on there and called it Argentina
At least you got Greece right
Looks fine to me, Ireland can have Northern Ireland and Scotland, they’re drains in both senses of the word
this isn't insulting to me, living in the North of England
Poor effort with Britian and Ireland
Ireland should be called the british isles with  northern Ireland called "united ireland under british control" or some shit to piss off both sides
Scotland should be called "the english" and northern England should be called "the south" and southern england maybe "france". Wales should just be ignored
calling England great britian is not offensive its just the wrong border
Why would we
Driving on the left makes most sense

Uk has less road deaths than frace, germany, italy
The other 3 large nations in europe
No just facts
How about the fact we have less deaths than just about anywhere else in europe
That list shows Germany has more deaths per 100,000
not less
Per 100,000
Not total people
Desperate for a stat hey
What about the rest if europe who all have far worse mortality rates and drive on the right

Oh come on, this is REALLY fucking misleading
Sony doesn't claim to own Bach's compositions, they DO own the copyright to some recordings of his compositions and YouTube's automated content ID system mistook someone else's very similar sounding audio as copyright infringment
The simple fact is, if you want to use Sony's recording of one of Bach's compositions you have to pay them for it because they own the copyright to their recording
Just as James Rhodes, pianist, owns the copyright to his own recording
Fuck Sony
EU gonna EU
no doubt in my mind the EU will fuck the internet up
That actually looks quite cosy to just sleep on the seats
Something tells me she wouldn't accept the result of another referendum if leave won again
She voted to leave first time around did she
My Fianceé thinks we should have a referendum on wether ti have another referendum as that will give a facsimile of the result of the second referendum but also mak room for those that want to uphold democracy even if they dont want to leave
She's not Scottish lmao
I couldn't put it better myself
I agree in that the original referendum should have needed a larger majority either way to be acted upon
But given that the terms were agreed beforehand I think the result needs to stand
The precident of ignoring the vote would be very damaging
I also don't buy the angle of "given all of this new knowledge" we need another referendum
As far as I can see there isn't anything major known now that wasn't constantly discussed during the 2016 campaigns - except how useless UK politicians are
So when Conservatives get a majority in the next election, you would accept that would you
Leaving the European Union isn't a unicorn
It's the factions within British politics who all want different things which have fustrated it - not necessarily the difficulty of the act of leaving
Agreed but I think the post is more aimed towards the protest than how attractive she is lol
In England this was the first winter we've had in ages that wasn't just autumn but somehow colder
Like we actually had snow in winter, not in spring, in Winter
The reason for remembrance is to honour the last wishes of people who often knew they were on a one way ticket - sometimes people who had barely lived past their sixteenth birthday, it’s the very least we can do to honour their sacrifice and I don’t think it matters how we do it
“Do whatever you want
We will sabotage/hurt you regardless do to our perception you have wronged us in some way”.
How does that work
Fire = oh no its even colder
Regarding Scandinavia, here's a surprising, fun fact: Did you know that the Brits/well mostly English specifically etc actually have waaaay more Viking genes and DNA within them than modern day Scandinavians do
Genetically at least the English are the real modern day Vikings
You'd never of guessed that, but its true
lol ok buddy
we'll see if you're still laughing when the scots are your problem
On one hand, I'd love Scottish Independence so they can finally fuck off
But on the other, if Scotland said no again it'd mean more miserable cringe cunts like you
Fuck Brexit man
What ironic about it
They can have independence and join the EU, we’ll start CANZUK without them :)
Close to becoming independent
I wasn’t aware there was a referendum planned
you can't join the EU when you're in a GDP deficit so good luck with that

Would rather live in somewhere like France than Saudi Arabia

Yeah you’re right about that
Scotland won’t get an independence referendum under the Tories
It would be political suicide for Labour to offer one if they get into power
Any referendum is 10+ years away at the minimum
Then why is tech investment in the UK higher than any EU country the past 2 years

Indeed, I just finished a book on Venice, and it's repeatedly brought up that part of what made the city hard to capture is that only the Venetians knew how to actually navigate the lagoon without grounding the ship in a sand barrier or mud
During sieges, they removed all flags and stakes that marked out the "routes" for ships to dock in the city
There are many squares, with rock paving essentially behind the houses, take st marks square as an example of a huge one
These all have wells (bricked up now), and those are the areas where there used to be small patches of farmland
The city was essentially built upon an island, but the whole island was always just a shallow area, with mud beneath the water
The wooden supports just keep sinking deeper into that mud
It started out as a destitute refugee village, and took centuries to grow into what is is today
Venice became rich because it's located right where a couple of rivers empty into the Adriatic sea
So all the trade goods coming from Northern Italy and southern Germany were brought to Venice, and the Venetians in turn specialised themselves in importing oriental goods from Constantinople, Crimea, and Egypt
There was a seasonal pattern to the trade; Germans and other Europeans would flock to the city in Winter to buy up all the Spices and Middle Eastern goods they had brought over
'City of Fortune' by Roger Crowely is an easy and fun read on Venice
He also wrote about the Portuguese, the Siege of Constantinople, and the Knights of Rhodes iirc
Holy shit, that's scary
People barely even reacted to it
Bonjour

So, I'm thinking celebrating killing two birds/meat/rabbits/hares is because more dead means more food
Celebrating killing two flies is because they are a nuisance - more dead means fewer bites and less disease passed around
What about the pigeons and doves
Food or nuisance

I particularly love Rotterdam; it is supposedly an industrial/business city, but it is so green and is great for cycling around
Apparently they are not attached to old buildings so they don't have so much trouble as other places do when they need to change things
In the UK many girls are taken out of the country just for this horrible operation
So clearly many commenters haven't any first hand experience in this
THIS IS NOTHING NEW EVEN FOR INTER-UK LOADS
From 1996 to about 2004/5 I used to drive lorries delivering meat from an abbatoir to wholesalers, as well as pre-packed butchered products to supermarkets etc
Every load used to have to have a vetinary certificate with it
The abbatoir had to employ vets to complete those certificates and it wasn't uncommon to be waiting for the certificates to be completed
And this was back in the late 90s to the mid 2000s.
I’d have filled that much paperwork out every time I took a shit if i had to
Still worth it, maybe hire a British person to just fill out forms full time, job created right there
What a great thing Brexit has been for the UK
A couple of months in and we're yet to see any benefits from it
Let's party like it 1999
No, wait, 1929
Because the economy's bout to go souther than Shackleton
Lol this thread is embarrassing
Full of the typical europhile shite wanking over the breakup of the UK, pretending the EU is infallible
What a fantastic moment, I'm so glad we're finally leaving
It looked like we weren't going to actually do it at one point
Whoop, whoop
C'est la vie
Que sera sera
Et cetera, et cetera
Obstructionism by opposition parties in the UK, that is the sole reason
Horrendous waste of time and energy
At least now the government has a mandate so there will be one united UK team (hopefully) rather than the UK negotiators being constantly undermined by their own politicans
Oh leave the histrionics
I'm totally down for it, the sheer absurdity of Canada annexing the UK and acquiring a nuclear arsenal, along with 65 million people, would be worth the loss of sovereignty
WILL THE MUSLIMS INFECT BRITAIN’S SWANS WITH AIDS
Fucking dying
Judging by your comment we can turn Northern Ireland into the world's largest salt mine post Brexit so I'm sure we'll be fine
Feel like pure shit just want u back hun xx
Because its not uncertainty, its great news for the UK without getting delayed again and ending uncertainty
The role of an opposition party is not to oppose literally everything the government do for the sake of it
Very childish mentality
Cant we just rename Hull to Hell instead
Spoon
Long time no see
I would like to have that
[That's the joke]
It was a joke, mate
They called in the army last night, who have now installed trackers and signal jammers around the airport and specialist teams used to hunt them, but nobody has been found
The police have apparently identified "persons of interest" but that may be nothing
One theory a paper talked of was a team of people using more than one advanced grade drone that also pre-planned different flight routes and landing locations to swap out batteries at specific timings to avoid police/military detection
Which would require a lot of professional planning and capability
Others think it's just some idiot with his toy
The crown is so good
They regularly film New York scenes in the Northern Quarter of Manchester
It looks like Brooklyn
I live with an American here and it’s the first thing he said when he moved here
In fact they film quite a bit generally around the city
Northern Quarter is quite like Brooklyn architecturally
Makes me laugh when people say leavers in the UK just want an empire
The EU is literally created so that small euro nations can keep hold of empire ambitions
What did you use for the scale
Landmass
What does that even prove
The EU only makes sense and is perfect for all them former Soviet Union/Eastern European countries, The Baltic countries, Scandinavian countries, and for all them Balkan countries etc ie the EU is perfect for and makes sense for literally tiny, tiny populations, tiny everything, irrelevent, weak, powerless, backwater, little nothing countries, countries who've historically been nobodies, have not contributed much to the mass of human civilisation & humanity as a whole or not done anything of note, countries 99% of people in the world could not locate on a map cuz they dont matter and have never mattered etc
So grouping togther makes sense for them
But the UK, Germany & France are not those countries
They are by far, by many orders of magnitude they are greater and more influential & powerful on the global stage than every other country in the EU combined
The UK especially is a class apart
The EU from a geopolitical and soft and hard power view needs the UK more than the UK needs the EU
Also the idea that the EU is some unified country like the USA is laughable
The EU is actually just 27 countries all with their own cultures, languages, vastly different economies/income levels/interests/seperate bubbles etc Its still individual countries trying to screw each other over for their own benefit, there is no real unity or shared 'European' identity or nationality
You cant even agree on the smallest things or cannot even agree on the most essential basic things that a country needs to have to function as a proper country
How can you portray the EU as this one country when it lacks all the things that make a country a country
Lastly Brazil and India(China too for that matter) are all crumbling, extremely violent af, backward, poor(on an individual basis) 3rd world shit holes
Hell in Brazil many people leave their houses(and they're absolutely scared to leave their home to begin with, even to just walk to the shops) not knowing if they'll be back come the end of the day, they dont know if this day will be their last
such is the level of extreme violence, murder and fear that's rampant and outta control in Brazil
Brazil is an uncilivised, poor, uneducated, extremely violent dump full of murderous psychopaths and thugs
And India
lol they dont even have toilets & basic hygeine ffs, and im expected to believe they're greater than the UK
, Lol ffs get real people
India will most likely never have its shit together
And countries like China
well their military is nothing but a paper tiger, they have no way of projecting their force worldwide and China has no soft power to speak of etc
Outside of GDP numbers the Chinese are not a match for UK, Germany & France, not even close
This post is a joke, The EU has shown itself to be a joke
For all this talk about how powerful the EU is, well it hasnt shown much of that power, where is it
It doesnt exist
But reaminers keep telling me the EU doesn't want to be a single country/voice
These propaganda posts are starting to look manipulated
The UK is the largest soft power in the world, this really is meaningless
A beautiful work of art
No brexiteers thinks that, only remainers and euros say that remainers think that
Actually, we moved from 2nd place to 1st last year on the global soft power index
1950s architecture has a lot to answer for
Bruh there is no historical buildings in the US
> Holy fuck who even argues that both sides were equally bad
Tbh a lot of them aren't even Nazis, they're just those types of kids who just want to be "smarter than the rest" and "go against the grain" to prove that they're "free thinkers who don't listen to THE MAN
". They dismiss everything as being "Victor's writing history and propaganda to make themselves look good".
If the US, UK or Russian government said the sky is blue, these people would say "Not true, it's a government lie
im glad northern uk got better
No way the UK is that low for Al the time
Looks like all the unemployed people just moved to the employed places
Apparently zero hour contracts make up 2% of the working population
could you send a link
I will happily watch this lol
Sorry but this is twee and stupid and I’m not really sure why everyone is obsessed with not living in the US
Maybe they don’t do this over there because they’ve got more important things to be dealing with than Norway
Imagine inventing a sexual encounter to own the Euros
USA, why don't you just prepare your chicken like normal fucking people
We don't want your shitty chemical-washed chicken
I'd rather pay extra for organic
I also imagine the shelf-life would be decreased due to transport and varying temperatures onboard of planes
What's the situation with the UK after brexit, we be getting this shitty chicken
Shichicken
You sweet-taking devil you, I'm in
Yeah, but the majority of people won't buy that shit
Eventually, shops will stop stocking what they can't sell and the chemical-washed chicken deal will be left in the dust
I mean, we may be British, but we aren't *American*.
With our current food regulations, restaurants would be forced to disclose it on their menus
Can't imagine those restaurants will keep many customers after that
It'll all come back around to slap Boris in the face
Unless, of course, those regulations change
I bloody hope not, I'm happy with the current standards and I was hoping they would only get better in the future
This is amazing
Go Queenie
Let's get to no
she technically has power despite some of it being transferred to parliment in recent times
she tends to use it in favour of the people
she has been involved in something to do with syrian missile strikes and she is probably wiser than alot of politicians due to her life time experiences

I love that indefinable but very specific 'Europeness' about all of your fabulous places
So long space comrade
great idea
What's this got to with Europe really
Is there any legislation for it
Not trying to argue, genuinely curious

Cringe
Guessing Norway is #1
Ouch
Poor UK
France and UK neck and neck, just like always
I think the UK may drop a few places soon
Already happened
We were 2nd in 2015
Stalin was worse than Hitler and is responsible for more death and genocide, he systematically starved even his own people
Soviet forces raped and pillaged their way to Berlin attacking those who they deemed subhuman, mainly the Polish
The Soviet Union was perfectly happy to let Hitler and Nazi Germany do as they please until Germany invaded them going against the non-aggression pact they had together
They did not recognise the Nazis as a threat until this point
Neither were good, both were atrocious and celebrating the Soviet Union is no better than celebrating Nazi Germany
Not sure if how accurate this is, is funny or depressing
kinda both I guess
Unelected
Shit post
What’s funny about this is the eu act as if they are the normal ones, they are not
the uk is the normal one, controlling their borders, etc
like 90% of the countries on earth
Deserve it how
You don't have to be ashamed of your country
In my experience, not really
Or at least it's counteracted by Brits who have an opposite view
You epitomise the phrase "tory"
Well yes it it is, it’s normal to control your own borders
see 90% + of nations on earth
Easy to have high/ish standards of living when you don’t even pay for your own defence
As a Labour supporter, and the next generation, it's our issue just as much as yours
But how much do you hear about English affairs
I always wonder what it's like on the news, because BBC news never reports about you
Yeah because the eu then was the same as it is today
Not hard when you are 37 people in the country
You share our pain of actually wanting to watch something that isnt he news at 6pm
Well we’ve invaded Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan in the past 15 years so
Pretty sure France had a lead in the Libya one
And yet they moan about the border at Calais every day
No deal it is, we can't allow the EU to try and annex UK territory
Actually, the EU saw this coming
Back before the vote, we tried to renegotiate our membership, saying “Its this or the the vote”. Polls said we’d vote to leave
They rejected the deal, we voted to leave, and now in 2 months they’ll be £150/week poorer
They need us, they’ll make the deal, because the EU only serves to support its own interests
Theres a reason the British Standards mark is held in more respect than the CE mark: We don’t accept the bare minimum
Never have
We’ve stood alone against the world’s largest armies less than 80 years ago
27 nations don’t scare us
Yeah we’ve gone full idiot now, just stop the food and fuel and it will sort itself out within the year
The rich who orchestrated all this will be fine
It’s been fun while it lasted
So long and thanks for all the fish
Hope you like asylum seekers because we’re coming soon
We love camping
Reckon I could swim to France on a clear day
Wish me luck
Off to get a wet suit and brush up on my parle en Francais
Before the US and the Soviet Union joined, we fought to stop the invasion
Also, we were the world superpower until one of the wars
God made the world, the Dutch made the Netherlands
White people, simply lol
A very strange people
in Sweden its probably because the kids can actually afford accommodation and to go to uni

That’s actually kind of dark

Possibly but also a definite correlation with over protective mothers who still do their adult babies washing and cooking for them

Great map
Brits as always going to Spain
At least it'll be easier to protect France now
Nah Gibraltar is Belgian now
Gibraltar is the new Scotland
Does this now mean Jersey is the part of Spain that they want to claim as theirs

Good luck with transitioning the Scottish highlands
In a way, I think this drive to view maps in purely economic terms may explain some the of unpopularity of the EU
I’m willing to bet that this map almost certainly mirrors population density to some extent (excluding the top of Sweden
Christ knows how they’ve managed that)
And where there are more people concentrated together, more money gets made
Who knew
Would be nice if we still had a few areas of unspoiled natural beauty (and relative economic fallow-ness) left in Europe, no
does this mean in terms of stuff built or something else
Wessex is a transition period
Having lived here my whole life I truthfully cant tell of that's accurate
How come Portugal is mostly red with some blue
Why no yellow areas
Yellow gang lets go
I feel like the West coast of Ireland should be excluded seeing as there isn't a single motorway or train line along the whole NW coast
I think this is probably slightly misleading and skewed by multinationals raising the GDP per capita
Article about it here:
But apart from that, what did the Romans ever do for us
What's that one way over to the south east
And the North African outpost
Why was the Mediterrainian(and its surrounding areas, North Africa too) and Southern Europe waaaaaaay more urbanised than Northern Europe(where cities and towns really were not a thing, why was that)
What's the African city
Mamucium / Manchester standing by
I am from Warrington - which was a market town by the Mersey established by the Romans as it was a crossing point
I now live in Stockport, which was a market town established by the Romans
I am Roman Catholic
Romans
Teutoberg Forest best day of my life
And fortifying Northern England against the Scots
I live in a British roman town, Cirencester
The romans named it Corinium
We have a great museum about it
Those aren’t Glasgow and Edinburgh, they’re Cramond and Old Kilpatrick which we’re roman settlements
Nice Sopianaes
And Bristol City
They’ll be riding canoes in a few years

I did the same with getting my Dutch passport last year, Brexit can suck it

Yeah, this is some weird shit:

- Only one post
- Said post is just vague, sanctimonious shilling for the EU
Im kinda confused I thought to show Forty thousand it would have a comma like 40,000 rather than a point 40
000
Is this just an alternate way of representing the number
So I get downvoted for asking a question

The comic is in French so, I doubt the author is American or supports that view
And then occupied Europe all the way up to Lisbon
The US didnt save anyone from nazis, it saved half of Europe from the Soviet Union
>the Nazis
>WW1
> India + Pakistan
I still don't get why it's our fault that Jinnah popularised the Pakistan movement (even then, the movement existed without him)
Lets assume we *don't* partition India and let them sort it out on their own; would we get the blame for the inevitable shitshow that would happen between Pakistani nationalists and Indians against the creation of Pakistan
Not to mention we aren't bloody responsible for Hindu nationalists like Modi's gang nowadays, who alienate their own Muslims within India
Oh fuck off, at that point you might as well say Germany owes Italy reparations over the Gothic sack of Rome
Confirmed cases actually makes places that are testing more look bad, obviously
Not saying that is what is happening here but it is not a good metric by its self to measure how well a country is dealing with it
Geographically its much closer to Baghdad than it is to Saint Petersburg
Its also located fully on the Asian part of Turkey(and if Turkey is considered not European then Georgia is likwise defo not European either), so its not even in Europe
Last time i checked its in Asia
Georgia
yeah not Europe im afraid
r/Asia is that way>>>>>
Is "aamu" the Finnish word for "AM"?
That's basically a yes

I really want to know what was going on inside that head of his

Portugese girls must have very light skin
awwwwww
You're wrong
Most Armenians have black hair, tanned skin and long noses
Western Turks look European
Missing doggerland
We should bring back doggerland
Italy had some thicc thighs
Kinda off topic but isn't 'Lest we forget' meant for soldiers
Which means it happened within the lifetime of most people in here
Iceland searching UK is interesting, any idea why
Italian food, Italian weather, Italian wine
These are the finest things in life
I hate to be that guy but the UK isn’t a country lol
I'm sorry fren, we'll be in benidorm in the millions by August <3
Sneaky Spaniards doing that to Gibraltar all day too
Denmark have Bang & Olufsen and Sweden has Volvo so both pretty based
Finland ngl, not sure what you got
Do Icelandic people go on holiday here much
I went to Iceland in 2014 and absolutely love it
Although it was summer so always light but I think it is one of my most favourite countries I have visited
It’s a group of countries lmao
That is quite interesting
Definitely cheaper than Iceland however beautiful your country may be :)
ok I am wrong Nokia is OG
And the eu ain’t considered a country is it
Still one, but one country in the Union ;)
I’m going off majority, and nobody thinks the eu is a country
My definition of a country is a strong faction with its own government and military, owning a vast amount of land and a sustainable economy along with trade relations with other countries
Then respect the fact I have my own opinion, just be open to others’.
Damn people come together to promote equality and loads of scared people do nothing but show hate in the comments
so these nazis clearly don't remember what happened last time
It shows just how terrified people are of what they don't understand
For many innocent refugees it's hard enough to build a life, never mind with all the hatred shown towards them
then i fully support kicking their asses again
Oh yes, their hate towards people like Muslims probably comes from searching up "bad things the Quran says" rather than actually knowing about the full religion
I never got why schools in the USA don't teach kids about religion
That sounds pretty intense, we usually started around eight years old and learnt about various traditions and holidays
If I wanted all the atheists are evil stuff I'd just talk to my grandma
It's interesting, if that happened in most other countries, the people would fight for equality
Its crazy how much influence media has on some people, it's created a hatred for millions
I told you that France turned the frogs gay
Now check Africa and the Middle East
The  map isn't accurate
Homosexuality was legalied in 1967 in the UK
Pretty much every single map posted on r/europe is inaccurate
With the UK the 1967 is the partial decriminalisation rather than it being legal, so for instance you could only have gay sex in a private dwelling if the doors were locked, there was no one else on the premises and both parties were over 21
Also you couldn't have sex in a hotel as that was considered a public place and no more than 2 individuals
Also it was a illegal in the armed forces until 2000
so "legalisation" is a bit disingenuous
Is that so, I wouldn't have thought that you would forget the napoleonic or the world wars that quickly
A patrician in the streets but plebeian in the sheets
Did they get up early to put their towels on the chair lift

Ireland vs The Sea
You must be a right shmigus-dingus if you think this is a real thing
Check out r/belarus
TLDR The dictator there has falsified Sunday's election results, declaring himself the winner with 80% of the votes when in reality he probably got something like 9%. This is an insult to the Belarusian people and they have been protesting en masse for the last 2 days whilst facing severe repression from the police & military
Жыве Беларусь!
He is like a real version of Major General Alladeen
And then you have the children on Reddit going "haha communism funny"...
Ad hominem moment
Hear hear
To be fair that's kind of true about any country
And places like York, Liverpool, Oxford or Cambridge still get huge amounts of international tourists each year, its just talked about less
Assume all the British ones are just cabbies
Solid 4th place
You brought up a valid point, and then followed it up exclusively with examples of things that are now completely unrelated lmao
We use Christmas for a holiday because there are specific traditions associated with it that we enjoy
It has nothing to do with religion at this point
And we will be using the Gregorian calender for hundreds of years, until something really unimaginably important happens, because our lives and history are so ingrained in it
We will still be using it in eras where an average person won't even come across someone in their life who's gone to church
Happy birthday Lithuania
Happy Independence Day
I got you bro
No problem
Spend wisely
I'm absolutely fine with Scotland and NI holding referendums on their position within the UK
Northern Ireland costs us a lot of money and if Scotland doesn't want to stay then it's best for all parties if we split
A UK of just England and Wales isn't bad and can actually have a very bright future
Let them go if they want to go
Just wish they would hurry up and do it already
Give them another referendum , I'm tired of hearing about it
UK rids itself of 60% of its budget deficit
If it has to undergo the same scrutiny as any other applicant it'll struggle as it isn't likely to meet budget deficit requirements even if it gets 100% of the tax receipts from North Sea Oil
Sturgeon's spending plans depend on £7
1Bn of NSO tax receipts
2015 it was nil, 2016 actually cost the UK over £300m as they paid out more in subsidies and other payments than they received in tax, 2018 it went up to just £1Bn on a substantial rise in prices
I feel bad for Scotland
Another border
Yippee
Wales are thinking of breaking away too
Good luck Scotland, you'll see your 10% English population rise dramatically were that to happen in the event of Brexit no doubt
Mate only 600,000 more people voted remain than leave in Scotland, and the majority of Wales also voted to leave
The Scots should "suffer" because we are a democracy and vote as a *nation*, not as individual ones
London also voted to remain but Peterborough voted leave, should one city be in the EU, and one not
40% voted leave
not exactly a pro-EU country
British nationalists
like the scotz
Godspeed mate
I hope you guys can find a way to accept some stowaways from the south
Going just as "The Kingdom" might be a bit brazen in international relations though lol
>The “United” comes from the union of the Scottish and English crowns
Wrong
The union between England and Scotland was known as Great Britain, not the UK
The UK is the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, that is why the full title of the UK is "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
a man can dream, the amount of money we sink into N Ireland and Scotland is ridiculous
I really wish they would leave so we would stop funding them
Feels bloody great
Once again why does the graph showing 13% exclude London and the South East when they're as much a part of England as the Midlands and Yorkshire
It is not only possible to calculate Scotland's budget deficit based on current spending, [it has already been done]  and the picture isn't good
Whilst it has reduced it hasn't reduced as much as the rest of the UK and is still three times that of the rest of the UK and almost three times that of the EU budget deficit target of 3%. Remember that as a member of the EU you'd have to have the proposed budget agreed if the deficit is larger than the EU's target 3%. Bye bye free prescriptions and university places
Scotland controls a lot of its own spending, NHS and education for example, as well as some of the taxation such as income tax
I don't think many Englishmen are going to be getting riled up simply because Scotland are pondering EU membership
Half of England is still pondering EU membership
population doesnt equal electorate
But one of the least pro-eu countries inside the EU
>in the words of the Treaty, "United into One Kingdom by the **Name of Great Britain**"
>The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707
On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the Parliament of **Great Britain**,
Also your "sources" are neither sources, nor support your claim, i have no idea why you linked them, did you even bother to read them before posting them
> Because it shows how ridiculous it is trying to calculate 'shares of a deficit'
Not comparing nation to nation
> Honestly, how can 8% of the population be responsible for 60% of the UK deficit
It is a laughable statistic
How the fuck do you think free prescriptions and free university places are paid for in Scotland
The universities and the pharmacists bill the Scottish government
Scots also have poorer health than English too so healthcare costs to the government are higher because of that too
Also income wise there's just less money generating business in Scotland and they're businesses that generate less profit per business than England, especially London
Wages are also lower too so you have more public sector expenditure with lower tax receipts per capita
So is 60% of the UK deficit down to Scotland or not
If it is then it doesn't matter how you visualise the data
You can visualise it any way you want but the plain truth of the matter is London, the South East, Yorkshire and the Midlands are part of England so the English contribution to the total UK deficit is just a few percent
Your graph is willing to lump in Edinburgh into Scotland I noticed
You can't exclude London and the SE in England's figures just because they happen to have an inconvenient surplus but include Edinburgh in Scotland's because it has a convenient one so I would argue the graph on the right is the misleading one as it requires London and the South East to not be part of England but Edinburgh to remain as part of Scotlands figure to have any validity to the claim of 13%.
What do you think the words " of Great Britain" mean here
not referenced as the UK of Great Britain
Also, i already quoted the actual treaty which literally refers the name of the new entity as Great Britain
Your source is an archived version of 1 web page which no longer exists
Why would you consider this a more trust worthy source than the actual treaty itself
It isn't meaningless, the calculations have been done by people much more better educated in it than you and I taking into account things like the Barnett Formula and North Sea Oil revenues
If we're talking about over-centralisation Scotland suffers the same, the vast majority of its economy being from the M8 belt
> What I am saying is that the 'deficit' figure isn't really useful for more than anything that describing UK finances
It isn't really useful for the independence argument
It is but not the independence argument you're thinking of
It is very useful to those in England wanting independence from a Scotland who seem to do nothing but blame them for everything wrong in their nation
> I think the clear implication is that it is not
Nobody agrees with you including you
As it currently stands Scotland is responsible for 60% of the UK deficit
> Are you joking
7 of the 10 poorest areas in the EU are in England
But the so are some of the richest including London which as the world's largest financial centre is the richest in the EU
>The colloquial name was then accepted in 1801 and adopted as the formal name
Because in 1801 the act of union between Great Britain and Ireland was passed
>The Kingdom of Great Britain was replaced by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801 with the Acts of Union 1800
[3]
Just stop, down voting posts because they prove you wrong is pathetic
> I'm pretty sure I agree with me
Nope
You've not denied that under the status quo that Scotland is responsible for 60% of the deficit
You've merely tried to argue that if things changed that it wouldn't be and I don't dispute that
> And as the capital of the UK, not just England, a portion of that wealth is owed to Scotland
Only because of the Barnett formula
Does your 13% claim take into account removing the money Scotland gets because of that
> it's oil fields that bring big business
Not Scotlands or North Sea Oil
Especially North Sea oil when there was so little profit made the UK government LOST money in 2016, over £300 million
> [You might also want to have a look at some of these, when you have a moment
The GDP per capita of London is over 2
5 times that of second place, 90% of that of the next three richest regions combined and four times that of the two regions mentioned in the article title
If you were trying to make a point you've just used probably the worst source you can
>Wikipedia article again
Which is quoting the actual treaty
>which uses sources you’ve previously refused to accept as valid
Actually it doesn't, it doesn't use the source you quoted
European Union
Not Europe
No UK ruining it
Wow that feels weird :(
That’s what you get when you don’t have free healthcare
Sweden alone now has more new cases than the entire UK
Wow
States did not implement the same levels of lockdown measures
Some were too lenient, some locked down too late, others lifted it too early, etc
Do we have a graph like this for the Swine Flu pandemic
Now I'm curious as to how Obama's administration performed at that time

Oh yeah I'm sure the reaction to this has been pretty awful in some places
Damn missing you already

How many Germans does it take to tell a joke

Just to let people know, the speed limit in Britain is 80mph
For some reason officially its 70 but everyone goes at 80
and the government doesn't care
That 80 at the bottom so you don’t do the island in a minute flat
Yeah all the signs are in mph in the UK
I drove from the UK (Norwich) to Poland (Poznan) and back last Christmas
I have to say that driving through Germany was absolute bliss
I sat at ~90mph for the width of the country, on fantastic roads, without too much traffic
and it’s little
Nice

It keeps flip flopping between 51/49 which is why important life changing referendums like this should have something like a 2/3rds majority required
Move to Ireland, mate

Election isnt referendum though
Its in no way representative of a referendum
SNP will always score higher in elections than they will in referendums (also I think everyone realises there won't be another vote on scottish independence for at least a decade or 2, so its not a barrier to voting SNP)
But the way it is going, they will eventually leave
Maybe not the next vote or the one after
It seems to be like Ireland and the Lisbon Treaty
Keep on having referendums until the "correct" answer wins
I don't know enough to make a proper informed comment on the topic
All I remember is that turkey was fighting the Kurds who were fighting Assad and Isis
I don't know much about their culture and where their historic land is but it seems as if turkey is trying to prevent them breaking off Turkish territory
Like I said, I don't know much
It's a unique topic considering the circumstances of the Kurds, Turkey, and who is supporting who
Thanks for the info
I was more in favour of the Kurds to start with but this made me more supportive of them
Even without what's happening to the Kurds, I still hate erdogan

There's a Finnish tv show called Poliisit
It follows round police in various Finnish towns
The episodes when it's mid summer (Heuva Juhannus
Everyone) are great as you get people sitting outside and drinking for 3 days straight as it never gets cold or dark
People get absolutely trashed
A bit sad, but it makes for good telly
Edit: typo
They were common in the UK until about 20 years ago, as a way of transferring money, but I don't remember them ever being used in shops
It's also spelled 'cheque' here
They started being phased out around then
About 10 years ago they disappeared almost completely

Ahh Ladybower reservoir, love Sheffield having this beauty on its doorstep (actually 1/3rd of Sheffield is within the Peaks
Grew up here and I can confidently say, it does not get old
Ahh, I do miss the Peaks when I'm not in the UK
Sure
It has some pretty grim parts, being a lot of ex-industrial-turned-council house estates and the like
The city centre is pleasant, there's *alot* of green spaces, a 3rd of the city is in the peak district (NW, W, SW sides) and has access to the rest of the peaks too, along with being only a couple hours away from the big national parks further north if that's your thing
Plus the water tastes great
Tbh when I'm travelling on a train or coach, unless it's a stop at a small village like the trans pennine line, i can't really get a great impression of the town/city
Although the train line from Sheffield east through Rotherham *is* grim and makes you want to puke
Yeah Sheffield is unbelievably underrated
But tbh I'd rather it that way, don't want an influx of rich southerners like you get in Leeds and Manny
What the fuck is going on on in Germany

I thought the UK would be higher, until I just remembered that we are one of the highest countries where students and young adults live with their parents
We complain about the lack of housing because the government prioritises business over homes
We have more than enough space to cater to the people but they have no interest in doing so
Not to mention the messed up laws that benefit landlords and leasing agreements, so no wonder no one wants an apartment
Never mind the fact I don't want strangers living above or below me where I can hear every footstep, door slam and everything else
I want my own private property where I can do as I please without disrupting other people and vice versa
I'm entitled to that
I mean out of living in a flat and a house I'd take the house
I only call them apartments when I fell like being a posh wanker
Albeit when I do see new flats being built they are labelled as apartments
How come
It wouldn't be my ideal nor many other people's. I'm lucky enough to live in the countryside, I'm sure a lot of other people would live in rural areas if they could
Let me expand a bit
By entitled, I mean the majority of the British people are very hardworking, dedicated individuals, many of which are workaholics
We rarely have nice weather so we spend a lot of time indoors compared to the rest of Europe, especially now we are in lockdown and so many of us are now working from home
Unlike the people that live in places like sunny Spain, Italy, Portugal etc we spend a lot of our time in our own homes (again, the point I made about our weather)
So as you might imagine, the British hate the idea of being stuck inside with a bunch of noisy people living above and below us
But considering our work ethic, we also deserve to be rewarded with something
The government thinks the best reward is to spend spend spend on pointless crap, but the reward we want is the opportunity to buy a home free from disruption
It's not a big ask, it's a very fair ask
We have more than enough land to go around for everyone but our government keeps prioritising shops and apartment buildings
It might be acceptable in countries where you are spending most of your time outside in the sun, but here it's not
Humans are annoying creatures so when you spend a lot of time indoors surrounded by them, you'd may as well at least try and surround yourself with a few you love in a house instead of the old woman upstairs that vacuums at 6am or student downstairs that thinks 3 am on a Wednesday is prime time for blasting Stormzy
Edit: Hahaha this is actually being downvote
This is a more than valid enough argument but whatever, Reddit is full of morons
You lot would downvote Einstein if he corrected you on a scientific formula because your stubborn 'hur dur I'm right your wrong' mentality
Either you're a Eurosexual or Anglophobe because you've taken every single point in my comment and spun it in the worst way possible to suit yourself whilst making it look as though I have some kind of agenda against Europe
Get off your fucking high horse
If people have enough money, they're entitled to whatever they can afford
You've spun it to sound like I think everyone should get a free house
I shouldn't need to explain that part but clearly you've not understood a single word I wrote
Also, no, you didn't use my own words against me, in fact you've gotten self stuck on the completely wrong end of the stick
You're the one interpreting things wrong, it's not my problem

Not sure where you got that idea from
In some other European countries you can't even flush paper

I guess I'll have to sound like a Corbyn Tankie for this, but from the perspective of the Socialist world, invading Czechoslovakia was a perfectly reasonable response to what they perceived as a NATO plot to overthrow the government of the Czechoslovaks
In the same vein that the USA, UK and France would fight wars to prevent communist takeovers in other countries
These are all acts of self preservation, as each side assumed the other was always poised and ready to launch WW3, and any weakness in your alliance could potentially be your defeat in the coming war
Socialism doesnt preach perpetual race war and extermination of foreigners like Nazism does
No because that wasnt really a danger to the existence of the British state, unlike comprising the Warsaw pact which did pose a "losing nuclear world war 3" danger to Russia
According to experts the reason Brits are so fugly today is because the vikings took all the attractive, good looking hot people from Britain during their many raids for British slaves(who were worth alot, highly prized were Brits by the vikings)
So over time the Brits got more and more fugly as the Scandanavians got more and more attractive
That's why we Brits are fugly, its not our fault see
In all seriousness though: Just why were British slaves so highly desired and prized by the vikings
, What made Brits so special to them
Since you start speaking it so young
Do you have a thick Swedish accent when you speak English or do you sound like native English person, where if somebody didnt know you were Swedish they'd think you were English
Looks like a great opportunity to study the local geology though
I’m a Con voter and typically consider myself just right of the centre

brexit will be an interpretation question topic in the UK history gcse in 10 years
Haven't seen one of these brexit cartoons in a while
What a refreshing change
They’ve removed a statue of Grant in the the US
Ya know, the Union General fighting against the Confederates
In the US, a BLM mob tore down the statue of a Norwegian-American *anti slavery abolitionist* who died fighting against the Confederacy
It's a fucking iconoclasm at this point
At this point, I bet statues of any notable figure from before WWII is coming under fire from the mob
Hell, they went after Lord Baden Powell, the bloke that founded the Scouts movement
Bismarck was a Conservative, Monarchist, anti-Catholic, anti-Social Democrat, etc
He is controversial in Germany independently of the Battleship
The fact that Prussia literally doesn't exist anymore doesn't help his legacy, since Bismarck was more of a Prussian nationalist than a true pan-German
Bavarians, Rhinelanders, etc
generally don't care for him, or even see him in a negative light
Yes, but not in the most "diplomatic" way
Bismarck was/is actually controversial among German nationalists because he "didn't finish the job". Bismarck cared more about securing Prussian power than actually about unifying the German people, and he deliberately excluded the Austrians (back then, considered Germans) because he didn't want Protestant Prussia sharing any power and authority with Catholic Austria
Bismarck also had the whole Kulturkampf thing going on (his culture war with the Vatican to ensure the Pope had no influence in Germany), which alienated Catholic Germany
Wrong
You've started a Finnish fire that will burn for a thousand years

Russia gets what Russia wants
They see Ukraine in their sphere of influence along with Belarus
Once Eastern Ukraine is in their influence they will try and go for the Baltic’s.
The use of cyber, hybrid and conventional warfare in Ukraine has made Russia’s intentions obvious
They want Ukraine under their influence and once Ukraine ousted the corrupt pro Russian leader it was obvious to Russia that they needed to take it by those types of warfare
Like Hitler in Czech Republic and Poland, he is using Russian ethnicity and background to launch a war in Ukraine with the overall goal of conquering it
What can the west do
Well nothing, similar to Britain and France with Hitler, we don’t want to risk a war defending a foreign country and so unless something drastic happens (It won’t, the Kremlin is smart) the west aren’t going to get directly involved leaving the people of Eastern Europe to defend themselves from the Russian federation which has the main foreign policy of re-gaining the soviet sphere of influence
Blame Germany for buying gas from Russia
We've really been meaning to give that back
I know it’s a long read so I will sum it up, basically Russia knows that Lithuania has close ties to the west, larger western support and a low number of ethnic Russians
So yeah it’s going to be tough for them to subject Lithuania in their sphere
But as the document suggests, Russia has slowly bought out most of the Lithuanian newspapers to try and slowly spread Russian propaganda and narrative, slowly trying to integrate the Lithuanian economy with Russia’s and trying to get Russian music, tv and culture more mainstream there
Lithuania is going to be tough for Russia to get a grip on but with western incompetence Russia have got a long term plan
But yeah with a general pro western political class and population it’s going to take time for them to gain Lithuanian influence (if at all)
I’m not comparing them two, just comparing their methods of taking over countries using hybrid warfare and ethnic population like Hitler did in Poland and Czech Republic
The €5m fine is a cap but if EA were to continue their practices then a larger fine could be imposed

> And how do you differentiate if someone actually invites you
With a thorough mutual understanding of the relationship between the two persons involved
Social context is essential
Asking someone you just met in a pub 'to dinner' is weird; asking someone you've known for 10 years is probably truthfully said
Whenever I asked a Russian 'how are you
' they *always* replied 'нормально', whether they were good or not
It's a similar response to the English one
You're meant to reply: it's a conversation starter
Just not (usually) with the actual truth
You can answer the first one is odd, if you know the person and aren't just unloading on a perfect stranger then it is an invitation to say something isn't ok
But the default is just to say something similar back
I do as well so I'm not sure that's an anglophone thing, more an ego thing
Because it's not a literal question of how you are; it's nothing more than a greeting and conversation starter
"That's not bad" means, in most circumstances, that the speaker is impressed by something but doesn't want to appear un-British by being enthusiastic about it
For example, if somebody asked for a restaurant recommendation I might say "you could try the Fat Duck, it has 3 stars so it's not bad".
However, we can also use the phrase "it's not \*too\* bad" if we are presented with something awful but are being a bit polite to say that
For example, you invite me round to your house for some food but you clearly make a complete mess of cooking it and burn it awfully
When we eat it you might apologise for it being horrible because it's burnt, so I might reply with "no, don't worry, it's not too bad", which basically translates as "this is a horrible meals, but I'm just managing to get some of it down to be polite
There is no 'problem': they're cultural differences
Well depending on where you are that's kind of rude, isn't life fun
It's fine we're infamous for not wanting to change how we act when faced with cultural differences
So cant fault you for doing the same
In a business environment
With other Brits, exactly this way
With non-native speakers, unless I knew that they would understand the actual implications of what I meant by "not bad" I might be tempted to phrase things a little differently
Here's a little story about the church and Poland
My sons mother is from Poland, a little city in the North called Słupsk
I visited some 5 times, very fond memories, always good weather, very cheap living
The first and second time I visit, in the centre there was a large beer garden
The bar was a pop up 'Tyskie' dome surrounded by benches and large umbrellas
The first time I sat there I noticed a lot of BMWs and Mercedes pulling up and men in leather jackets standing about taking
I asked my lady what was going on and she whispers "Mafia". I say "Holy shit, mafia" and she "shhhhhhs" me hard
Anyway, first two times we visit, I spend a fair but of time enjoying pints of Tyskie in the warm weather there
The third time, it was gone
I ask her mum where the Tyskie dome went and she tells me the Church didn't approve of the Mafia conducting their business in front of the church, so away it went
And that's how I learnt who wears the pants in Poland
ERMAGURD WHOLESOME POGGERS MOMENT

It's not just war
Many American (continent, not just USA) cities suffered the same fate
Cities like Rio, Buenos Aires, Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, São Paulo, etc
Had wonderfully beautiful buildings and architecture, that got demolished in the 50s and 60s and replaced with boring glass skyscrapers and whatnot
Countries that didnt get bombed suffered similar fates
Look at old footage of Latin America and North American cities, compare them today, they also got fucked over big time
Three words: cost of labour

The same can be said for Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh
They are all very different in every way you mentioned and yet are still all controlled by the SNP
>England has a population 10 times higher than any of the other countries in the UK
This means when it comes to voting, the UK gets what England wants (9 times out of 10)
I having nothing against England, this is not a matter of being childish, and I voted No in the independence referendum
This is my exact problem with a lot of Scottish people, you want Scotland to be treated "equally" to England, which in your mind means that Scottish people as a whole should have as much say as English people as a whole, despite England having 10x as many people and that Scotland should be able to block whatever it likes
What you want is not equality or fairness it is the exact opposite
The UK is a democracy and policy should be dictated by the majority
If the Scottish people feel that their opinions do not align with England's and that they are unable to affect any sort of change in the UK then they are more than welcome to leave the UK and hand back that £13 billion subsidy back to England
>All I'm saying is that there is a blatant flaw in 4 nations being governed by a single parliament,
Except for the fact that England and only England is the only part of the UK or any UK dependencies that is wholly governed by the UK parliament, it has no devolved government like everywhere else
This would not be a problem if England got to decide everything but because of issues like the west lothian question that is not the case
Pretty sure I was on this train
That's a good point actually
Hadn't thought of that - mostly because I live in the north and drive to work
But my stepfather, an avid trainspotter and lover of all things trains, said that they're cutting train numbers next week
Now I'm wondering how effective that will be
If, proportionally, the number of trains is cut lower than the number of commuters, that will just make things worse
Which was, I imagine, a spectacular mistake
But refused to allow the Brits and French to send soldiers and war materiel through their country to aid Finland
Plan R 4 was only intended to take place if Germany violated Norway's neutrality, as per the article
I don't doubt that Britain's motives were to harm Germany economically, as opposed to a purely humanitarian motive in aiding an ally &mdash; but that's not particularly relevant to my comment

As a visitor from outside of France the differences in the various regions probably stand out more to us

Well, realpolitik is still realpolitik, countries dont have "friends", as Charles de Gaulle said
But, I do think the "US annexation
" Boogeyman falls flat when you look at Canada and see that they have NAFTA and higher standards of living than the UK (and France, Spain, Italy and Belgium
Given that Canada's population is half of ours, and their GDP smaller, how come they havent been reduced to this horrible wasteland that the USA supposedly will turn us into
Likewise for New Zealand
Tiny country, small population, outside the EU, still thriving and doing better than us
Edit: USMCA replaced NAFTA, but according to ex Canadian PM Chrétien, it barely changes anything
If it dies then it's the EUs fault
>The English arent that much different to Americans anyway
Sure, besides the vastly different views on things such as Healthcare policy, gun control, government systems, Police's role, schooling systems, etc
Propaganda*
True, but I excluded Japan because they have double our population (127 million Japanese VS 65 million Britons), so they're not a "small" country
But yeah, Japan in the 1980s was literally a juggernaut that became the worlds second largest economy
They shit the bed in 1989 with the stock bubble bursting, but are still a respected and rich nation today
Because they fell for the PR/propaganda
Of course countries, or supranational entities, will always try to make you think they are emotional entities like you and me, but that wont change the fact that they work based on interests and not "friendship" or anything of that sort
Yeah, but who cares about all that when it comes to the quality of life for the people
I'd much rather have the UK emulate Switzerland and become a do-nothing country, than continue to play at geopolitics and have our population live inferior lives to others
Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, New Zealand, etc
Yeah they're utterly irrelevant on the world stage, they wont be deciding what happens in the Middle East, but does that negatively affect them
Do the people of these countries somehow miss out on anything by not vaporizing Arabs
Hell, they actually gain respect and admiration for being peaceful, while we are subject to terrorist attacks and international scorn due to controversial foreign policy
I'd like the average British citizen to live well in our peaceful corner of the globe, as opposed to living a mediocre life because the military needed more money to drop bombs on cavemen in Afghanistan
Fair enough, USMCA is the new name right
The quote is attributed to both men, and also Lord Palmerston
Well, Brexit still sucks, the scenario I'm describing here would be a status quo at *best*, the UK won't be improved by Brexit
Yeah, they're intertwined, but it often looks like ideals take the back seat when the stakes are high
Communist China and tne Capitalist USA manage to form a quasi-alliance during the Cold War after all
We're talking about living conditions and per capita statistics
Being rich as a country doesnt necessarily mean life is good there
The UK and France are far wealthier than the Netherlands or Denmark, but Dutch and Danish standards of living are way better than French or British
Another example of course is Switzerland
GDP wise, Switzerland has a smaller economy than the US state of Pennsylvania, but I think I'd rather live in Switzerland than Pennsylvania
(no offence to Pennsylvanians, Quakers and William Penn are cool)
Don’t go by cases go by deaths or even deaths per million people as deaths are they only thing they can reliably count

Its also a little disingenuous to  make a claim to the Englishmen who fought and died
Pretty sure most were probably just fighting for their homes and family, to stop the Germans invading Britain or becoming too strong to stop
Highly doubt many were actively fighting to bring peace to the continent for people whose norm was nationalism/patriotism rather than altruism at least for the common man or women
People shouldn't speak so directly on behalf of the dead when a claim can't be proved almost decisively, that goes for my own comment
He is just using emotive language in an underhanded way to make English people feel like they betrayed their countrymen who came before them
If the share of votes, reflect that the elderly voted for brexit (plus a few anecdotal stories of brexitter veterans), it suggests those ww2 Englishmen would vote out as well
He is building a false narrative to make English people feel shame
Edited: to reflect jewishbaratheon's point
The earth is now equipped to start fucking the solar system and maybe beyond
How is Britain the warm one
What the hell is going on
It was -5° here in the West Midlands, and it’s currently snowing which didn’t happen for 6 years until December 2017
This winter can lick my left bollock
Smug gits in Spain and Portugal
Is there another one for today
> [Winchester Castle]
These days its a museum, I suspect you mean [Windsor Castle]
... like well done
Idk
Imagine her trying to lecture anyone about climate change or the environment when she’s spawned 7 children all probably with their own staff etc
So was the voting corrupt
Or were 54% of Austrians really short-sighted, ill-informed, narcissistic tools of the Establishment
With the unfolding calamity of mass immigration causing pain, destruction and chaos throughout the Western world, it beggars belief that any pro immigration politician can still win an election
Wake up people
yeah because electing the left wing Hollande was such a great thing for France
Thankfully there is no chance that the left wing will win again, it will be between Fillon and Le Pen
Fake news
No way this is in Finland and these kids are not Finnish
I mean look at how close they're all standing next to each other
Personal space is being violated en masse + one of them is evening smiling
:O.. No Finn would be seen smiling or even tolerate their precious personal space being invaded like that
So this has to be another country not Finland
Why
[*Yes you do, you've just used a double negative
The red spots may look like houses to the untrained eye but they are clearly lava plumes
It's called sarcasm you buffoon
Yes
The more 'diverse' a country becomes, the more centralised and militarised the state needs to be in order to retain control
Lee Kuan Yew wasnt kidding when he said democracy would sow chaos in Singapore due to ethnic diversity
Lizzie will keep going til Charles is 6 feet under
Even she knows he'd make a shit king
Fucking Charles
Why did you choose that picture of Prince Charles
In the UK it actually changed recently in 2011
"Sons and daughters of any future UK monarch will have equal right to the throne,"
One interesting fact is that the Queen is head of state of 16 countries and all 16 countries had to agree on the change
He actually is
But more bizarrely, it's not arabs but [badgers] which draw the prince's ire
Charles is more of a natural gizmos hippy actually
This hurts my heart
The Dutch are such kind people
Should they not be punished in the country they committed these crimes
European elections are too complex
I think Brits are pretty much over the hole Falklands thing
It's generally the Argies that keep bringing it up
English people don't get pissed off about Malvinas at all
We barely even know generally that there's any sort of fuss about it
Argentinians on the other hand
I honestly don't think that anyone, except *THE* most knuckle-dragging EDL supporting idiot, would get anywhere near annoyed at *"Las Malvinas son Argentinas"*... and even then the aforementioned nationalistic wankers would probably just laugh in your face before repeatedly chanting "IN-GER-LUUUUND".
Far more effective IMO would be:
>The England football team is shit
...or variations on that theme
Lol saying the Falklands are Argentinian wont annoy us English because they're still English atm
It'd just make us laugh at you
You want to annoy somebody in England
Call football soccer
"Wow this is highly upvoted
time to see what silly stuff got the continent so worked up
*"Les Malvinas
*flips table*
I don't get the one for England/Wales
For us Kosovars, it has to be: "Kosovo je Srbija"
I'm English & I don't get the England one at all
What
Someone explain pls
Who does this
Why
It might've been deliberate
I'm sorry you get grouped in with us twats
nah most people know what it means, granted mainly because of the top gear episode
For instance, by omitting them from a map of Europe
by ~~declaring~~ reminding them that English cheese is better
Oh, I think that would only upset a minority of the country
Oh right, thanks
I've heard of the falklands, not sure why we're supposed to care though
> "You'd be speaking German if we hadn't won the war for you
Unless they're a russian they can shut their filthy hole
Also that thing about tea is just absurd
Nobody could possibly think that way
Don't encourage them it'll just get worse
> Britain could hold out indefinitely
Thats the part I'm not sure about
The germans got france and tried for britain but failed
They couldn't successfully invade but I don't know just how long  they could have held out for in a battle of attrition
I used to find it funny how my Finnish ex would have quite a varied pitch speaking English but in Finnish, it was a monotone deep voice (for a girl)
I miss it
It isn't that far off to be fair
Every time I climb that it never fails to amaze
Happy B-Day Estonia
Now as a Brit idk much about Estonia so ive some question for any Estonian redditors reading
Can you sate my curiosity and tell me what its like in Estonia
* To any Estonians reading how would you describe your average Estonian person
, what do you think when you think of Estonian person

Where do they see Estonia and humanity going in future
* What's the level of English speaking like in Estonia

, And what's the one thing you hate about the English language
* What does the Estonian school cirriculum consist of
What do you learn about
* I am also curious on how much do Estonian students learn about Britain
Do you learn about the British Empire, Industrial Revolution, The Middle Ages etc
and are basics beyond trading and wars covered, or do go more in-depth or is it just those two main topics
Just what do you learn about the UK
I was also wondering how do you view the UK and British people(and culture too)
, Do you like Brits
* When it comes to things like sex and porn here in the UK we're very prudish, awkward and puritanical, its a big taboo to openly discuss such matters, we like to pretend it doesnt exist etc
Well my question is what's it like in Estonia
Are you much more open about sex and porn
What's the Estonia's view of sex and porn
Is it like the UK
* Is Feminism a thing in Estonia
, And if feminism is a thing is it out of control like in Western Europe
* Are most Estonian men uncut or not
* What is the LGBT situation like in Estonia
, do they have rights
, Is LGBT and being gay accepted socially and cultrally
Just whats it like being gay or trans in Estonia
* What types of music are popular in Estonia
What do you Estonian guys & girls listen too
* What are race relations like in Estonia
* What are foreigner relations like in Estonia
* What are the police like
how good(or not) are the Estonian police
* What are Estonian unis like
how good(or not) are Estonian Universities
* What is the Estonian school system like
How good(or not) is the Estonian school system
* What is the healthcare system like
How good(or not) is the Estonian healthcare system
* What is Estonian TV like
how good(or not) is Estonian television
* What's it like living in an entire country yet with such a tiny population
Does it ever feel very limiting and too small in Estonia
* Lastly what is this "can into nordic" stuff about
What does it mean
, and where did it all originate from
Idk, but im no mi6 spy(why would you think that
im just a curious, inquisitive person is all
I like to ask questions, i just wanna know more about Estonia in this instance as the topic at hand as it were
Some northern English and Scottish dialects contain large amounts of Nordic words in their vocabulary
Bairn springs to mind
This is the type of post I love seeing in this sub

Mr Speaker I must register my dissatissfaction with the Right Honourable Member of Franconia for his use of what is, frankly, unparliamentary language
Mr Speaker, might I remind My Right Honourable Friend that our enemy is the Roman Empire not one another, such petty squabbling is not in the interests of this Parliament and we must focus
If my Right Honourable Gaul's grievance is over the incident with the rugby match then this was a simple misunderstanding
Speaker, I'd like it on Record that my constituents regard this motion as "A Big Oof". Thank you
Mr Speaker,
I wish to request an amendment to the amendment requested by the right honourable member of the German contingent
I put forward exchanging 'loveable idiots' to 'loveable eccentrics'.
Thank you kindly Mr Speaker
Mr Speaker, my esteemed friend the Right Honourable Member for Franconia will surely be aware of the lack of space in front of Westminister given by the inebrietated members of the public brawling outside by noon on any given work day
As a point of order Mr Speaker I move to suggest any witnesses to our duel would not be able to pick us out from the usual crowd
Really surprised at Switzerland being so low
I read this wrong and thought it said "English profanity", and was quite confused since Scandinavians usually seem so mild mannered, at least except for Finns
This is so surprising and yet it isn't. I thought that Norway would have a high proficiency but Sweden and Finland
Finland
They take that spot as well as house of orange (Dutch Bros who then tried to steal the English throne after the civil war
I'm surprised with Finland because all the Nordic countries meme them for not really being able to understand Finnish
The norwegians I know speak really english really well tbh
so shiocched
I went through a period where my mobile number was (I guess) being spoofed and used for spam calls or something in Italy
I got quite a lot of calls or texts from Italian people who understandably wanted to know what I was playing at, but I never spoke to one who even had a word of English
Obviously that's not a criticism, but it was a bit of a surprise as it's very easy to assume that most people in Europe have at least a smidgen of English
Bwahaha
Sciocched ai tel iu
Don’t go to England we’re the worst at our own language
Yeah they usually speak Italian, you know :D
Or maybe because we learn English to actually move abroad later so those who are left do not speak any other language beyond Italian

Ireland can fuck themselves I suppose

It sounds like a good idea but it would be expensive and would really piss off some countries who rely on the sea for trade
Maybe make some huuuge canals on the Western side through the corner of Scotland

People shouldn’t be scared to post these caricatures
Everyone has parts of their culture mocked and it’s dangerous just to allow certain people to get a free pass
Thank you, mods
Why should we even have to apologise because of some braindead person, who, let's be honest, was not a Muslim and was only one by name
Sick and tired of this happening every so often now
We don't force normal American people to apologise for war crimes committed by their armies
We don't demand apologies from normal Beitish people for colonisation
I feel like with every day passing the hostility towards us in Europe and in America will only get worse, look at this sub for example
Look at Poland and Hungary, France and Germany now as well
So glad we won't see any more of Neymar rolling around on the floor

Happy Remembrance Day Netherlands
If I remember correctly I had some family who fought in Arnhem
Who or what did you gain independence from
The force is strong with the Netherlands
Glad I could learn more because something that seems to be lost on people in modern education is the days that Eroupe celebrate their liberations from tyrannical leaders like Hitler's Nazi Germany and Stalin's USSR
After reading your comments, I feel "read the room" doesn't really compute with you

I think Britain has been at war with or else had some kind of armed conflict with almost every nation that has been around for more than 70 years
I'm struggling to think of any forced takeovers (of/ by any nation) that hasn't caused suffering along the way
Power and greed are pretty awful human traits and it's only in recent history it's being checked, but even then you could argue that it's still going on, just with capitalism and cheque books rather than spears and guns
It's not genocide in my opinion as no direct action was taken to cause it
What Britain should have done is effectively temporarily seize control of the food supplies of Ireland and ration and redistribute
It's not genocide if it's caused by inaction (or too slow action, in this instance, as after a year measures were taken but this was too late) I don't think
It wasn't the British State exporting food
It was private companies owned by private individuals
i enjoy how you're incorrect about the british inventing capitalism, hand waving it as pedantry, and then stating that it's within their DNA, all within the same breath
We have this too in the UK
In March we had over a million on the streets of London against Brexit and we were dismissed as being 'paid protestors' with 'nothing better to do'. Even though the protest was on a Saturday
And of course the referendum is held up as the pinnacle of democracy, even though it was three years ago, there's evidence that it wasn't a free and fair ballot and there have been two changes of prime minister since then
If the PM can change because the ruling party changed their minds, why can't we have another say on Brexit
what a great thing to share my birthday with

The EU has not been the cause for European peace
That would be NATO
NATO is a mutual defence pact that is making sure peace in Europe is maintained (with exception to Ukraine, which is not in the EU)
'Peace in Europe'. Definitely not NATO, and there definitely wasn't that series of wars in the 90s. Or do people there not count as European
Some of these aren't exclusively EUs policies though, for example the UK had an equal pay act in 1970
I hope this has reached the Queen this morning
More EU propaganda:
* Structural Funding
paid for by our own money
* Beaches and rivers
i'll agree with this, although most British rivers are not deemed safe to swim in
* Cleaner air
bullshit, the EU barelyy even fined German car manufactures for Dieslgate, even the USA fined them more, it's all about German profits
* Lead free petrol
eliminated worldwide in 2006
is the whole world inside the EU
no, nothing to do with the EU
* a recycling culture
hold on, this propaganda piece are claiming the EU is responsible for the recycling culture
seriously
* cheaper mobile charges - bullshit
Every single mobile phone provider in the UK has said when we leave the EU, we won't have EU roaming charges reinforced
So if you don't need the EU for it, how can you claim it's because of the EU
* Break up of monopolies
laughable
....i was going to go through all of the points on the propaganda poster
but they are laughable and its a waste of time
Very very few of these things can’t be achieved by a stand alone country
Madness to think that you need a dictatorship to get decent food labels
Are we not allowed to question the glory of the EU
Are we not allowed to change the EU for the better
Are not allowed to point at the negatives of the EU
To be fair i imagine 90% of people who voted brexit would be able to concede that the EU has some benefits
> Which wouldn't've happened unless there was an EU to make sure it did happen
Any evidence for that mate
> Because initially EU law made it happen
Before the law there were roaming charges
The law happened, then there were no roaming charges
But some companies already offered EU free roaming before the law, so they didn't make it happen at all
They made some change, but they never made it happen

IIRC they might actually have had okay teeth
Australian Aboriginals are known to have had almost perfect dental care, due to a lack of sugar
If you didn't consume too many sweets and other forms of sugar, you could probably get by
The irony of all this, and I say this as somebody who has worked for Alstom and Siemens, Germany and France in a team-up could be a force for good in the world with nuclear energy if it wasn't for Germany's insane government and its refusal to treat its citizens like adults, sit them down and give them [the birds and the bees talk]
We binned our fission capability in favour of fusion, which will pay off eventually, but there's a 15-20 year gap that we need to fill and could have filled 30 years back with a state that is willing to deal with these issues
France has the reactor tech, Germany has the steam turbine tech (and used to have a very capable reactor industry), lets mash the two together and have fun
The big winner here will be France with low energy costs and carbon credits for days, and an export fission industry that is booming
Germany is going to be addicted to coal for decades (and it's only going to get worse with EVs), with skyrocketing wholesale energy costs because they're trying to backfill with wind power, and everybody else isn't going to have options
You're right about the UK but the potential for wind energy in the British Isles is enormous
Honestly I think enviromental groups's nuclear protests in the 20th century are the single biggest contribution to climate change
People say things like 'would you live near one
', I'd swim in the spent fuel pools its that safe
Not sure the whole environmentalist community doesn't support nuclear
Nuclear isn't renewable in the same way solar isn't renewable
The funny thing is you can use nuclear weapons in nuclear power in disarmament
So you can not only toss nuclear weapons, but you then make clean power from it
Nuclear power and disarmament go hand in hand almost
'its all fossil fuels' and nothing to do with picking to use fossil fuels in the first place
Didn't your green party basically emerge from the whole anti nuclear sentiment, its almost a perfect example of my comment
We could theoretically harvest uranium from seawater - its just a cost thing
Even then mining isn't a big deal on a global scale at all
Long term storage isn't a big deal, it just requires prior planning, also nuclear treatment is something thats advanced a lot
You're ultimately worried about the incredibly safe storage of nuclear waste, really don't get why
Most of it is low level or short lived intermediate waste than can be treated and burried, and the longer lived  stuff is generally left on site to decay before being deposited in geological vaults in incredibly safe containers
I'd argue in fact the waste produced by batteries, solar panels etc is far more hazardous than nuclear waste in terms of future prospects
Sorry about the Boris
Just Imagine

Reject Christianity/Catholicism or all religion
Estonia is not Northern European
Northern Europe - Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Netherlands, arguably Finland/ Germany / U.K. Estonia is very much Eastern European
That’s just the UN which has questionable definitions for loads of things
Socially the Baltic states are not even close to be seen as a Northern European country by like anyone in Western / Northern Europe, you guys are Eastern European, most people would agree
Why do you think otherwise lol
What has happened to our continent, why did this happen
I’m not Islamophobic but there’s no way in hell I’d ever abandon or hate on my own people, my ancestors and what my country fundamentally was founded and fought for throughout the last hundreds of years
Even if I’m not religious I’d never turn my back and hate on my own people, especially for a religion such as Islam

Reddit only cares because they will lose money, they randomly ban subreddit for bullshit reasons to protect their bottom line
Looks like a space Invader from another angle
Well that was certainly worth the loss of jobs, investment, funding, travel rights and trade
What I've deduced from this thread (and entire fucking subreddit) is that Europe really hates the British, despite the fact that not all of us are drunken hooligans who voted leave
I’m half Dutch so I have a British and a EU passport
Brexit can suck a fat one
The most important part is still made in England, the photo and bio-metrics page is still made here

Because the British government is a joke
Wonder how Scotland can afford to give all those people free tuition fees
Yeah well jokes on you guys, you'll all be paying the same as us in a couple of years
And I'm sorry I know we suck
I was going to go to uni and I wanted to study history but I thought that going 20k into debt studying something I liked with little prospects from it would be a bad idea
People don't seem to understand the English fee system very well
Your poor background would have 0 effect on if you can go to university yet
I've got a load of student debt but haven't paid a penny of it yet because I don't earn over the threshold
Hell, it's actually easier to go to an English University because you only need to fund 3 years of living costs, not 4
Scotland fucking condemmed the rest of us to the Tories
Hell yeah ["the English higher education system which has, in just two decades, moved from a free college system to one in which tuition fees are among the highest in the world
Our findings suggest that England’s shift has resulted in increased funding per head, rising enrolments, and a narrowing of the participation gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students
In contrast to other systems with high tuition fees, the English system is distinct in that its income-contingent loan system keeps university free at the point of entry, and provides students with comparatively generous assistance for living expenses
We conclude that tuition fees, at least in the English case supported their goals of increasing quality, quantity, and equity in higher education
No one’s gonna pay that amount of money unless they’re fairly certain they’re gonna pass
Free market in action
Fuck Jamie Oliver
By in large part economically relying on their neighbors then blaming them for all of their problems
>the university owns basically most of downtown
Also true for Oxford - a college will usually own several properties, especially venues like clubs, bars, restaurants
If the college wants to create something new, they might close a venue and develop there
That's been my experience in Oxford: "Nuffield College ends lease of *club y* to make way for a new networking spot".
I believe if you lived in England for 3 years before you start university or you gained your entry qualifications (A Levels) in England then you pay English fees
Scotland is a stronghold for the left traditionally a safe 50ish seats usually for Labour (60 years of being the majority party) and a small chunk for the Lib Dems
The fact all of them now have given up on labour and no one down south will take a coalition with the SNP they fucked us all
More or less austerity will never end and the tories will be undisputed forever
It was the Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition who abolished tuition fees in Scotland
Nothing to do with the SNP
now that I think about it this is actually kinda accurate hahahaha
That's just flat out untrue
If you earn over £50k and aren’t paying back your loan surely you’re breaking the law
Make sure you enjoy those while you can, bailiffs will come knocking before long
Confessing to fraud on the internet isn’t usually the best idea
> Ask the bloody Tories what Brexit will entail, and they'll tell you about how strong and stable it will be
We don't have a clue
> Ask Labour what their position on Brexit will be, and they'll give you some wishy-washy thing about how much they care about people
Half my supporters are for, half against Brexit, so I'm saying nowt
> Ask the Greens about where the money will come from, and they'll try to cough it out
We think society dying in flames is more important than low taxes, you don't, so we're going to waffle until you leave
>  I was surprised by how British it is
So pompous and superficial
First of all, how dare you
Yay we are back in the EU

Hungarian men definitely put the hung into **HUNG**arian
Just sayin' ;)
Jesus you Slavs are a extremely horny bunch arent you
, Fucking like rabbits
:O.
Now why does Ireland have such a low number of pornstars yet the uk has a really high number
But i guess you could say that the Hungarians are hungary for hardcore sex~. Also from what ive seen Hungarian men sure do put the hung in Hungary

Yeah but they are just Sophie Dee videos
To be fair I knew 13 of them by name
Oh thank God someone posted another brexit cartoon
I was going through withdrawal symptoms
Luckily I knew I wouldn't have to wait too long till another one was posted
Such a refreshing perspective each one brings
What a completely clueless cartoon
Scotland is not 'chained' to Britain, it was part of Britain, and most Scots are proud of the fact their scientists, economists and soldiers went on to defend the Empire and share in the prosperity it brought with trade
Why would Skotlanti chain themselves to Britannia
Most Scots are proud Brits, and my point about the Empire is not to re-make it but to highlight that the Scottish have contributed to the Union in remarkable ways of which they are rightfully proud
I hear rumours that even Andy Murray has adopted the title of 'Brit', which is a remarkable achievement indeed
Meanwhile here in the UK our shitey parliament pulled shit like this so many times but none of them have been sacked
It's uncommon, but I think I might have heard it before, and I get the meaning straight away
'Do as I say, not as I do' is how it's said here
Here in the UK i have family members who are half white x half black(mostly Black British of Jamacian decent, decended from ppl who came here in the 1950s post-war immigration, from former Carribbean British Empire colonies) mixed race etc
I'd say in the cities
White x Black ppl its quite a common sight tbh
Nobody seems to care much

Surely any US or non-EU based websites will be exempt from this
I have 6 small sites (woodwork, war movies and a hair salon website included) if I just move to a US server and my site is US BASED will i therefore be exempt from this bullshit

England should have the st Georges cross, not the union jack
Could include Cyprus but I understand if it doesn't fit
Sorry to be that guy, but that’s the Union Jack when it should be the English flag .
Why no countryball for Bavaria
Why have you used the Union Jack for England when you have made Scotland and Wales separately
Shouldn’t England have the St

Perhaps I'm being unfair (and certainly generalizing) but one doesn't usually think of farmers as being socially progressive
It's encouraging to see in any case
Edit:  thanks for all the replies
The consensus here is that the farmers *generally* aren't doing this to support abortion but because they have their own grievances against the government, though some comments pointed out that farmers also have female family members and the extreme nature of the changes and u/lorarc recalled the history of abortion in Communist era Poland
alt-sysrq to take a screenshot of the window in focus
Right so you’d be ok with aborting a baby who is due tomorrow

Oh what happened to you Sweden
As a gay man i was once one day looking forward to visiting Sweden
But now im certain that day will never come
As i'd fear for my safety, as a homosexual i would not feel welcome or safe in Sweden, its got to that point and with the way things are going demographically its only going to get alot worse, waaaaay more violently homophobic and unsafe in the future
I know many other fellow homosexuals who feel the same way too

me: bet he wont
If he is fine this time, he'll be fine next time
That's fucking amazing

It’s ghastly, I’d be tutting beyond belief if I saw this crap on the train, then again I realise not everyone is as rich as us and can afford top quality CGI advertisement that reflects on how dominant our entertainment industry is and that’s due to how influential we are as a country, from Dunkirk to Batman to Sherlock to James Bond, and Spain looks like they’re stuck in the 1970s and gave some teenagers access to clip art to make an advert, what a disgrace
Up until about ten years ago the UK was the number 1 most powerful passport

Remember when in your kitchen you had a drawer full of carrier bags and then one full of Nokia chargers
Remember when Nokia realised they were missing out on a lot of revenue from not selling replacement chargers (like Samsung for instance, who changed the charger head every two phones) so they changed the for the really delicate easy to break head
That's where Nokia f'd up IMO

As a homo i cannot talk about the Czech Republic without mentioning their world renowned, world beating gay porn industry
(on that note i felt a real sadness and shock when the legendary porn star, the one the only
Dennis Reed died not long ago last year at the age of only 31 due to a motorbike accident :(, RIP you beautiful man
The Czech Republic lost one of their biggest stars and brightest lights that day
He maybe gone but Dennis you'll always live on in your many works)
But there's so many hotties in the land of the Bohemians and Moravians, how do you Czechs do it
, what's your secret
, I bet its something in the water ;D. No but one gets the impression that there's a strong sense of sexuality and eroticism to the place
The Czechs are a intensely sexual people despite their outward exterior
But i digress
Happy independence to all the Czech guys and girls out there:)
Prague is one beautiful city too
I was in classes of 30+ all the way through school in England
I tried to get my daughter into a school that had only 8 students per year, I also tried one that had 20 per year, she got into the one that had 28 per year bit that's ok, it's a good school I guess
From England, 25 kids in my class
9/10 for accuracy
26 seems low for the UK, it was always around 30 in my area
Also from the south
Our classes always had 30 people because it was a mix of two year groups
It wasn’t bad actually
We usually had a teaching assistant as well but I really don’t remember it being a problem for the teachers to control us
Maybe the people in my classes were just well behaved lol
We had about 17 so swings and roundabouts
In secondary school we had 70 people in a year and 3 different classes
England is the best country

Not much of a castle
I could take that with 20 good men
Good bit of info
I suppose what we have over here is "Stately homes" or "Palaces", but yes you're right, not an accurate word for the things that sit in between those and castles
We have manor houses in England, which sometimes had fortifications purely for aesthetics
Sometimes people incorrectly call them castles though
Very interesting, thank you

Suicide is a bit more introspective than that

We beat you in Africa and are the main reason you didn’t beat the Soviets

Political discourse on /r/politics seems to boil down to

Someone pointed out that this poll did not include Cuba in the list of countries provided

Bernie Sanders says he wants to copy Scandinavia/Germany/etc
Bernie Sanders proclaims himself as a "Democratic Socialist"
Bernie Sanders supporters and opponents see that "socialist" in the headline
Both his supporters and his opponents now assume that the countries he wants to copy are socialists, because he called himself one, and said he wants to be like them
Then you have organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America who also constantly use Scandinavia as the go-to country to emulate, which obviously leads to people thinking that Scandinavia is socialist (since the self proclaimed socialists always proclaim their desire to emulate them)
I don't understand why Sanders does this, he is literally sabotaging his own campaign and agenda by doing so
Even if he insists on the *Democratic* Socialist label, he is still (in the eyes of the American public) connecting himself to every other self proclaimed socialist government out there, including the failed states
I believe they also have the most Nobel Prizes per capita lol
> considering every American I know who is socialist, immediately talks about forced redistribution of wealth
Well, in a sense, they're not really wrong on that regard
Socialists do not want massive income inequality, and taxation to fund welfare programs and such *is* a forced redistribution of wealth for the betterment of overall society

> focuses on rehabilitation instead of punishment
I don't get where this meme that European prisons "don't punish" comes from
Being imprisoned is the punishment itself, just because the bed is soft and the shower has warm water doesn't mean that you aren't being punished
14 days of quarantine was bad enough in my own house
Multiple years of being imprisoned, even if the facilities are good, is fucking hell on earth
You're essentially living like a hamster
I know of the debate, but it seems to have gone off the rails a bit and now you see people going around the internet saying things like "European prisons are very humane & don't punish you" (which simply isn't true; [British & French prisons have been under scrutiny from Courts and NGOs for having abysmal facilities and being overcrowded] That's how we end up with ignorants claiming that Anders Breivik isn't being punished in prison
He is being punished by being in prison to begin with
All prisoners in Europe are punished in one way or another, the rehabilitation isn't voluntary, they "show up" for rehabilitation because the state used force to put them in there, and the state dictates how they live their lives for a set amount of years

The mail represents the interests of the corporatist elite to the lower middle and working classes
Its function is to sell values to its readers that further the interests of those elites
When Britain joined, the idea was it was joining a single market that would, though competition, generate a 'race to the bottom' in regulation and job security, so the mail trumpeted it as a patriotic win for Britain
However, the EU has developed into something that creates and enhances regulatory standards - hence it has become something to fight against
Just like the rest of the country, when we realised that Europe isn't the utopia that all you Europhiles paint it out to be, and that it is actually a stagnant, bureaucratic, highly centralised organisation that is hell-bent on diluting our own British Culture, our own British world presence, and the positioning of the greatest country in the world on the map, and the assertion of its own independence upon itself, instead of being tied down by the painfully liberal and painfully cloth-eared EU

Thanks dude, greetings back from the UK
He was diagnosed with combat stress
I'd love to see you go out and fight a war and still keep your sanity
And anyway the guy he killed was a Taliban fighter so in my opinion he deserved a fate worse than death
The only reason i can think of that the marine should be punished is because he didn't torture the dirty goat fucker first
It is very clear you only think the Mail is corrupt because you don't like their viewpoint
I'd be up for that if it meant I got a day off
> In the medium term it will probably be the financial industry leaving for europe
Everyone outside the financial industry seems to believe this
The reality is that it probably won't.  Some segments of it may, but there are huge parts of finance that are unaffected by Brexit
More importantly, there is so much concentration of talent here in London that sheer momentum keeps it here
New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong are also outside of the EU and they do fine as well
We're not going to stop immigrants from coming here to work in the NHS, no one has ever said this
I mean that isn't relevant at all
The Daily Mail quite clearly isn't a Nazi newspaper and it is factually incorrect to state otherwise
Then why does the British public think that their newspapers are to the right of them - and the furthest right (relative to the population) of any press in Europe
are you like 14 years old or something
>And without those luvvie EU labour laws we can pay them below minimum wage for being brown
What fun
What, the EU labour legislation that in most cases UK legislation goes further and beyond
And its been illegal to pay differently for different ethnic groups since like the 60's.
The paper has run award winning investigation pieces, being instrumental in the conviction of Stephen Lawrence's murderers as well as well as fighting for the release of UK Guantanamo detainee Shaker Aamer as well as exposes on the care home industry
But obviously you don't actually know about any of that because you've never actually read it
> Even if they don't leave entirely, they certainly won't be investing more in Britain in the long run
I don't think that's "certain".  Neither you, nor I, nor anyone knows what the long run looks like
> There will be very little reason to do so over the continent or Ireland
The UK is no more a part of the EU than France, or Germany, or Ireland is, and yet London has been the financial centre of choice in Europe, dwarfing Paris, Frankfurt, and Dublin
It's almost as though there are other reasons that the London financial sector thrives compared to other cities in the EU, reasons that will persist after the UK leaves the EU
>  **Literally no company** in City is talking about increasing their size or shares in City
I work in the City for an American fintech company and we are growing our London office faster than we are growing our offices in the US or anywhere else
The UK still has enough cultural power that people want to come here
The English language and British culture is a mighty thing
So thats a yes then
Which only exists due to EU law
That wouldn't be able to happen outside of the EU and is a key reason why areas such as Norfolk and Lincolnshire voted to leave, because unskilled workers couldn't compete
Of course its not certain, its just a very high likelyhood, you can't just say 'oh but you cant know that for sure', bullshit, when the rest of the world is saying that, believe them
And half reason London was the financial centre of europe is because it was the largest english speaking city in the EU, now it isn't.

Don’t forget “The Market Gardener” in Team Fortress 2

Edit: also I'm trying to gauge as to whether or not your comment is racist in tone towards Pakistani people
Yes people from outside of Europe can make just as good of a contribution to your country as migrants from within
>Daily reminder that the Brexiteers would have him gone
You really are a low information brainwashed drone
The UK is consistently found to be one of the least xenophobic and racist countries in Europe, far, far less so than any country east of Germany
What sort of dribbling moron would you have to be that "brexiteers would have him gone", as though the plan is to deport EU born people
Outrageous that you got downvote bombed for saying that
Actually laughable that some of the same people who call the British racist for voting for Brexit think it's fine to be openly racist against non-europeans as if they're superior
Right, and shall we highlight some racist anecdotes in Poland
I'm sure they'll be really tough to find eh
The statistics say that the UK is far, far less xenophobic than Eastern Europe
The fact you can read English and thus consume English news stories gives you the impression that the UK is some weird racist dump

The left think Boris will get them an election, remainers a second referendum and hard core brexiters their no deal exit
All May got us was a deal that she couldn’t get anyone to agree to
We’ll see who is right, but I’ve not heard anyone lament Mays departure in the UK so far
Yeah, and in which of those is the higher education free
Because that’ll be the significant correlation
No wonder Scotland wanted no Brexit and England and Wales did
Can we legalise sterilising sex offenders pls & thank
Yeah if you think this isn't happening in every country in the world then you're properly naive
I was just thinking sex offenders in general, but the government won’t do that when they also have rapey boys in their cabinet
Repeat sex offenders would probably be the better candidate, I just was angry typing when I first made the comment
Repeat offenders are ignoring the human rights of others, I have limited sympathy for their rights to sexual reproduction (considering a lot of sex crimes are against family members)
No one lives there it's all jewelry shops now
Ah yes, let’s bring up WW2 era reasons for why Germany and Ireland get along, that doesn’t look bad on anyone
I wonder what made England and France unsure
Surely Germany had done nothing to warrant this and it was just the classic evil English doing evil things again
Whilst you think you may have been nice by advocating for reunification of one country, in this instance it would require the splintering of another
What happens to NI (and Scotland for that matter) is a matter for the UK and the UK alone to deal with
I wonder if you’re so quick to support separatist movements in your own country
Perhaps I should wish my good will towards the Bavarians
Yes the people of Northern Ireland who are part of the UK
I’m not trying to deny them their say if they want a referendum they should get one
The republic are entitled to some form of referendum on whether you would accept NI should they choose to leave (as if you’d need one) but unless NI votes to leave the UK then it isn’t anything to do with the ROI, and it’s certainly nothing to do with Germans or the EU
Keep downvoting me though, hurr durr England bad
I can’t be arsed quoting in my answer you’ll have to bear with me
Splintering of Germany was a direct result of WW2
Calling it a WW2 era matter is perfectly accurate
The people of NI chose to be part of the UK
For a long time (and for many still today) NI has been the strongest champion of the union
When the Irish Free State was created the territories of Northern Ireland were given a choice to opt out and stay as part of the UK
The northern Irish had a month to decide but elected to choose to rejoin the UK on the very first day with the northern Irish prime minister saying “we do not want the world to think we had a moments hesitation”.
We are not illegally occupying Northern Ireland
They very much want to be part of the uk, no one has treat them worse than the catholics
We’re lucky to have them and they’re lucky to have us
This is kind of shit that made me reply in the first place, everyone outside of the UK seems to assume that everyone in Northern Ireland hates the UK
This is completely not the case, and everyone should stop romanticising it as if it is the case
Even after Brexit NI STILL didn’t vote majority Sinn Féin
Also, seeing as you’ve criticised my education I’ll criticise yours
When I say NI is a UK matter, I’m speaking the truth, because NI is part of the UK
How does no one understand this
It is the decision of the UK government whether to grant an independence referendum and, just like we did with Scotland, if NI votes overwhelmingly in favour of independence parties I’m sure we’ll get one
Unlike the rest of Europe (particularly Spain) we do actually give our people the choice to decide their future
Everyone is mass downvoting but can’t wrap their head around the simple fact that you’re all advocating for the splintering of my country and somehow you think this is totally fine and justified
You wouldn’t say that about any other country in the world
The UK (which again I apparently have to reiterate includes Northern Ireland) will look after NI as it has done since 1922
If they want to leave they will be able to, but right now they don’t. Stop
Romanticising
Our
Separatist
Movements
Else I expect you to go harass the Spanish about the Catalans as well
Aye I obviously understand where the sentiment is coming from, I’m furious about Brexit/ Tories/ the general right-wing hellscape we’re turning into as well but unfortunately it’s my house so instead of shitting all over it I have to try clean up
Unfortunately others in the thread have just written me off as an English dickhead but I’m glad you seem to have understood things from our side, no other country in the world has its separatist movements romanticised by complete outsiders like ours are
If Scotland/ NI bail now the UK is essentially dead, and while a lot of people around the world would likely be happy about that due to what’s gone on in the past this is my country and I can’t just resign myself to watching it happen
There’s plenty of time for us to change, I doubt anyone would have predicted we’d be here in 2010 so who knows where we’ll be in 2030
You know how it's always said that world maps are really wrong when it comes to the scales of land masses, like how Africa should be much bigger and Europe and North Asia should be a lot skinnier or something, well how come the Ottomans were off as well, they weren't using fucking
satellites and shit, they were just trecking it down the sides of continents, surely they should've realised Africa was a bit bigger than that
OK, so let's say Mehmet the cartographer walks from Algeria to Cape Town, he walked over like a curve, and when that curve is put flat the curve isn't accounted for, just the flat distance, so the Continent can seem shorter
Something like that
I'm not really religious but line dancing is definitely a sin
>herd a bunch of rats
Strong language
I think we'll start to see more of this as the requirement for pan European nationalism grows in the EU
You can hardly call what may negotiated a deal
Ot was metaphorical anal rape
>Why would the EU make concessions against the interests of the people they represent
Because if they don't they guarantee the worst case scenario for a number of countries, particularly Ireland
That's just the harsh reality
You can say "but that's not fair", whatever, it doesn't matter
The EU put forward terms which no country in their right mind would ever accept
The UK had a democratic vote to leave and the EU are holding them to ransom for it - against the economic interests of their own people and the people of the UK
The only people it protects is the body of government that is the European Union itself
Personally I think it's scandalous - but entirely to be expected
It's really soured me to the EU and shows that they care about progressing their high-minded "project" more than caring for the people they represent
Mate Boris probably doesn't even know you poor sods exist up there
What's worrying me is that your government is calling for an indepence referendum (which is fair, you guys deserve it if you want it) but with a view to staying in the EU as an independent nation- ~~but I dont think you match their population minimum to join the EU yourselves, so you still wouldn't be able to
EDIT: Have now been educated on EU policy, thanks
This is key, the amount of grandstanding about what parliament doesn't want resulted in no possible solutions
No deal is the default regardless of how many times they vote against it
that's kind of the point of the deadline
>I probably should have used a different metaphor,
Absolutely
Many in Europe should be careful before referring to their opponents as vermin, given historical context
There's a reason every no-dealer with any influence is a fabulously wealthy stock-broker type
Well, that's a weight off my mind
More power to you
Cheers
And here's to Romany happy returns
Whats the literal translation of "la multi ani"? At/of many years
Mulțumesc
Never thought I would be this fine with brexit
Boiled meat
idk anyone who eats boiled meat
Its not like prehistoric times anymore(even back then i doubt boiled meat was common)
Your much more likely to get roasted meat here
And if its one thing we Brits have always done very well, one thing we're still world leaders in: Its roasted meat
Beautiful, wonderful, delicious roasted meat
We roast meat better than most and like no other nation Earth
We are world famous for it
Roasting meat is hard coded into our DNA
Brexiteers (crazy name, I know) don’t want a deal as much as you do
Yeah the "UK has shit food" is such an overdone and frankly completely incorrect insult
Pot calling kettle, mate
Let's take 1/6 of your wage of you and see how you feel
Banana split
I'd love to eat more Dutch food (only had a bit in Amsterdam) because being from a country that isn't a snob about other countries' cuisine I am always excited to try others
If you think food in Scotland is better than England then you really haven't traveled them much
No, it's more like 33
5 million folk, of which 16
1 million were happy to stay but are getting dragged away by the other 17
4 million
Scottish and Northern Irish people only represent 13% of those that are being dragged away
Thank fuck we voted Brexit then, can be doing with all these poncy EU regulations, lets go back to the good old days like wot it was when I was a kid, ham egg & chips for dinner every day washed down with a drink from the hose, can't do that nowadays with all this elf n safety
Wasn't eating none of that foreign muck either and when we found a bit of broken glass in our jar of pickled onions we never used to moan about it like the snowflakes these days, health and safety my arse, nothing wrong with swallowing a bit of broken glass and nothing wrong with a bit of salmonella either, back in my day wot before all these fancy EU names for things there was no salmonella, if you got sick from an egg thats wot your immune system was for
kids these days wouldn't know anything about that now would they
When I was a kid I used to paint all my Airfix models with lead paint, none of this regulated EU crap and it didn't do me no brain damage did it
Lets get Britain back to being British
Don't need no EU fatcats telling us what to do, we've got a special relationship with America, the more like them we can be the better frankly, let's aimt to live up to their standards of food safety and healthcare
Are all of my eggs gonna be poisonous after 2018
But getting whooped on 1812 means your our bitch again
Some people do but you don't need to, have you ever seen eggs in the fridge section of the supermarket
No, mine just has trays
Some do but I think that's just because they're usually made by American companies
Eggs last for like a month in the cupboard, why would you need them to last any longer
That is not what Salisbury Cathedral looks like
We use the lederhosen for Germans, swiss and Austrians here in England
Its recognized as an Alpine thing, but gets applied to all of Germany
Kinda like how everyone associates the entire UK with England
I think your thinking of /r/europe
Typical Dutch humour
I could tunnel underground and end up in the fucking Netherlands
OP is British
Oh yeah
Irl foreshadowing
Not strictly true
The first cars were made around the middle of the 18th century, but before the early 19th century they were steam powered
The first poduction car was the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, first built in 1885
No, I don't. As I said, the first production car was first built in the 19th century, probably should have specified that was internal combustion powered
Steam powered cars had existed prior to that
beginning of the end lol
it was long over by then
Man, look how relatively dark Scandinavia is
I live in a Swedish city so I don't see it, but sometimes I forget how small the populations are here outside the hubs
Replace all the “neutral” countries with “positive” and that’s basically my opinion
Surprised France is so high
The two things I’m most interested by:
a) the 50% +/- is exactly the Iron Curtain (except countries too small to register)
b) people on here seem to have a hard time believe that some people take the piss when answering YouGov polls
They never asked me
1% of people haven't heard of France :D
Which one of yall has a problem with Estonia
UK is too high our country is a mess
well, aren't they a theocratic oligarchy
that's not great, though it would be neutral for me cause they're smol and not hurting anyone
Of course we love you, why do you think we’re so reluctant to return Greek cultural artefacts of historic importance, we got that philhellene boner same as Byron
Do you wanna get out of here
I hear the East Indies are nice this time of year
Well the Romanian pickpockets and gypsies aren't really helping your reputation
Same reason you hate you
:-)
I wouldnt say political but rather their country hasn't got much to offer just a flat boring country with not much to do
Where sweden and Norway have alot more stuff that the uk doesnt so were more likely to visit and have a more positive reaction to such countries
definitely germany
While it is solid banter it should be higher though, our oldest friend, much love, we should write more
Albanians run a lot of gangs in London and haven’t assimilated at all so they get a lot of coverage in the news
I’m gonna be honest as insane an idea as it is, the idea we’re pulling America’s strings and are behind everything has a highly erotic appeal to me
I remember in Afghanistan the locals basically had a saying that was like “blame the English” and it was just said about any weird occurrence or bad thing that happened, icr exactly
> masters of evil, they control everywhere and every conflict, the puppeteers of America
I wish this were true :'(
Overall they come out as neutral
Maybe some people just chose to go hard with a negative opinion rather than admitting no opinion at all
Kinda weird that for a time a part of Croatia was part of the French Empire, is that ever brought up there, is it common knowledge
Europe would be a better place if we all paid more attention to Estonia
I've been a massive advocate of Estonia's digital citizenship platform since reading about it
Especially as somebody who keeps moving house and having to fill in and send off multiple pen and paper documents through the post each time
Estonia sometimes seems like an advanced utopia compared to the UK
What does it say about out education
Also you have to factor in trolling in surveys
It also depends on how the question is asked
Ireland is an island not a country
Hola
You don’t know how much hope I lost in humanity when everyone was praising Putin and calling him smart because he said “Great Thunburg Bad”.
Right
We played such good game the last couple hundred years they can’t believe we’ve actually become so grossly incompetent, it’s got to be planned
Our tory government decided to not make school meals free for children meanwhile they get £25 for meals on a £80,000 annual salary, and there is a clear north south divide
eh not really though
You’re the first Romanian I’ve ever spoken to who has a reasonable opinion of your country, then
Most Romanians I know are savagely critical of literally every government since Ceaușescu
And obviously they hated him too
Just to be completely clear in case it’s lost on anyone, British people do not actually dislike Scandinavians because of the Vikings
My guess is it’s just the sheer number of Brits who have trodden on Lego
Plus Sweden have ABBA and they’re are third largest religion
No not the pink map
One of the few instances of perfidious Albion actually being a thing
No that’s more to do with Sweden
who cares
Yes Ik I’m saying that this should be a thing that should be extended, I’d rather have money go to feed hungry kids than middle class MPs
Fair enough
Very admirable
And you’re right, of course, there’s lots to love about your beautiful country (particularly Sibiu for me)
That said, I’ve yet to hear good things about your government
Sounds like the whole thing needs a lot of reform
I don’t get it, and I’m british
No British people are going to leave for the continent over Brexit
Still a great country to live in, with or without the EU
This is why I love Europe
Just be aware that if you go an hour in any direction, people will sound completely different
You'd think Brits would be used to that but we don't know the true horror
I started learning Copenhagen Danish and then lived in Midtjylland
It was an experience
I just learnt to say "ikke" at the end of every other sentence, that usually worked
Ja, girlfriend taught me how to ikk' with the best of them
So Portuguese is just cockney English
Cool
This was the strangest thing I saw today :
Coal not dole
Germany should be getting huge fines for the emissions they cause
>You can even reserve a place in the queue using an app
blasphemy
Don't you dare try to steal queuing from us Brits
It's the best thing we've given to the world
Hahahaha ok
Text-based memes
Going back to our roots
I like it
It's not about the act, it's about the democratic mandate which the EU commission do not have
Parliament cannot introduce laws though
"I've chopped your bloody arm off
May is a remainer and doesn't believe in leaving the EU, nice try though
Lord Buckethead cannot be hurt by mere mortal weapons
Other than feed them, wash them, look after them, love them, be there for them, give them exercises, give them safety
I hate this meme
They wanted to move their capitals between their countries
Brit here
Lots of us didn't vote for this shit and we still hope it doesnt happen
Thanks, I actually needed this tbh
I am very anti-Brexit and still consider myself European and having to stay here arguing with everyone about everything is fucking exhausting honestly
This really brightened my day :)
In the end it's just politics and it makes me sad that a lot of people have conflated Brexit being about disagreeing with the government body that is the EU, with it being about disliking the PEOPLE of europe
Of course you guys will always be the best of friends to us
Never doubt that
Love you all
From a Brit who voted for Brexit
We are a sh*t show
I say welcome to the long 21st century my friend
If you think this problem is uniquely British, you're just mistaking us being first(second actually, after the USA) at at something again
Look at the country around you, do you think it will survive as well
The EU can will not really shield you from this
It is only an agreement between states
Prepare yourself for a tough decade
Help us
Everyone who doesn't want Brexit can't vote, and and the young people that can are massively outweighed by our huge elderly population that all vote Brexit and think they're doing us a solid
Honestly, I kinda wish you other countries could like
signa
Petition or something
Like yeah foreign powers shouldnt interfere with internal affairs, but I'm not 100% sure this is just an internal thing
Ah well
Probably wont be all that bad
I don't wanna leave, I been asking diffrent EU embassies for advice and it's comes down to "we can't do anything", leaving us going to fuck UK my future and kill alot of my job prospects, and with how our government is going we might need to take a hint from HK
Brexit is wearing us all down to our last nerve
Thanks for the kind words
Yawn
Agreed
>constant British dismissal of Ireland
You're an independent country lmao
I care about you Ireland
>Alot of us support the EU's line against our outrageous demands, and also support your stance on Ireland
And don't we know that remainers support all of the EUs demands over the UK, no matter what ️
>is willing to break the GFA
Could you be specific on which part of the GFA will be broken by the UK leaving the European Union
Here is the document:
Go ahead and tell me which clause specifically requires the backstop
>I don't know where you get this from
Remainers often tell us "no one in Europe cares, they have moved on, Britain is insignificant, Europa Uber Alles".
It's part of their routine of denigrating the UK to convince people we are too pathetic and insignificant to be independent
...what
>have Britain treat Ireland like a rebellious English province
No, you're being treated as a foreign country
Something that your ancestors fought to obtain and you constantly brag about
All of a sudden you want your own interests to be represented in Westminster
Ridiculous hypocrisy
Your interests are not the concern of Westminster any more
Your ancestors fought for that right
> Like why won't we just let them dictate everything while we just subserviently watch
This isn't happening
This is just a made up victim complex you've created
If you haven't noticed our new PM hasn't even bothered to meet Varadkar
If the UK was 'demanding Ireland fell in line' then we would have put some diplomatic pressure on them
Instead the Irish government is being effectively ignored
Welcome to sovereignty and independence
>we won't just go back on the backstop
Ireland was asked late in the hour if they would provide an independent exit mechanism separate from the EU in the backstop, and Tory MPs voted for this showing that if this amendment was obtained they would pass it
The Irish refused
Please tell your government to start taking responsibility for their actions as an independent nation
>The EU has remained reasonable and willing to engage at all times during the Brexit process
Meanwhile
Yes of course
Like I said we are aware you would support any demand the EU could possibly make
> Brexit tells the majority of Northern Ireland to go fuck itself
No it doesn't.
that's an implication on your part not mine
"I am anti-Brexit" and "I am European" are two separate statements
I'm not saying you have to be in the EU to be European
> Britain treat Ireland like a rebellious English province
Why are you concerned with this then
Ireland is independent and the UK is independent and the UK can act how it likes in accordance with international law
The Irish seem to want it both ways
Want to be able to be independent and gloat about separation from those evil English bastards, and also want those same evil bastards to take your considerations into account when making decisions on foreign policy
Very strange
Schrodinger's republicanism
Westminster is well aware
It's Ireland that is in a mess over how to blame the UK for the border the EU is going to force it to build
> The majority of N.Ireland voted remain
Brexit changes the status of N.Ireland
"The Status of Northern Ireland" as far as I read it in the document refers to Northern Ireland being part of the UK or part of Ireland
You seem to be interpreting that any legal change or foreign policy decision taken in Westminster would require a referendum in Northern Ireland
It seems that is a gross and deliberately ignorant interpretation of what "the Status of Northern Ireland" refers to
> All that matters is they're breaking the GFA
No sorry
They aren't.
The UK isn't going to build a border
We would only be "blaming you" if you were
What we are saying is your border is your problem
The UK can't stop you from building a border
We can only hold up our end of the deal
And who said Russians don't have a sense of humour
lol
Send us Brits some help
We and our country aren't built for this
For an island most our beaches suck and are ironically far away from most big cities, we don't have outside pools and we don't build with air conditioning but insulation
Its hot and humid and we're all bored and overheating
We'd never have left the EU if you made pools and air conditioning mandatory
I've had enough already
God I love summer
31c is fantastic
30 degrees and my car has no AC :)
Just had a wee peek at my weather map
Some crazy looking storms in Central/South France right now
I really need to get my visa for Iceland
The UK south was like 31 degrees was it not
Not south-east side
North-West England hotter than Portugal
The map doesn't look accurate to me
Plus there massive temperture differences all over the map right next to each other, 10c right next to 21c in Sweden for example
Can we swap places
Sweaty
Well yeah it does happen
Heathrow recorded 33
4 earlier which was hotter than Barbados
But its north Scotland
Tourism isnt what it useally is at the moment
Also even when I went there a couple years ago it wasn't that busy
I know this is r/Europe but you should stop falsely inflating numbers to push a narrative
Ya see the problem is we aren't really taught we need a second language, compared to all the other countries
I did GCSE french this year and tbh my french is worthy of a damn 10 year old french person
Is Ireland an anomaly
Eg did this survey (or its participants) categorise English as a foreign language, seeing as a lot of that age group would now learn at least some Irish at school, even though English is an official language of Ireland and arguably the vast majority learn it as their mother tongue
Why  is England so high
All jokes aside it very much is
Remove immigrants and their kids from the equation and that number will likely more than half
Amongst friends and colleagues the only people I know that can speak more than one language are from other places, so Hong Kong, Germany,Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia, Denmark, Norway, Iran, Czechia, Portugal, Venezuela, Spain etc
I think I’ve only met a handful of brits that speak another language, it’s much less than 30%
This sub is just a circle jerk at this point
Yeah that’s an exaggeration but I suppose that’s what cartoons do
Exactly
This subreddit is so bad when the posts are about the brexit situation
Can't we just go back to posting photos of old doors
not inside the EU they are not
what sort of independent nation cant control it's own waters or borders
No we cant, we tried to ban shark fishing in british waters, the EU refused to allow us to do it
which we couldnt
Not that we could catch more fish, that we could stop others fishing our waters and allow UK fishermen to do it, regenerating fishing villages all around the country
Assumptions are the mother of all fuck ups
Germanic peoples rise up
Ahh the uncentered flag
Oh no however will I manage to not anwser the phone to a number I don’t know
I live in the UK and I’ve never had a robocall in my life
Everyone else is saying they have one regularly
Is this weird
So the UK has deliberately overridden the E.U. laws to make it shitter
Twats
I hate this country sometimes
Well it's not working
I get them all the time
UK is in the EU last time I checked
Political elite don't want to
No thanks
yayyyyyyyy
Still a month and a bit of Summer to go and in my experience (no scientific basis), August is generally warmer than July here in the U.K., at least here up north
And only two records have been set for coldest in Europe since 2000
Obviously we still suck at measuring cold
Bloody idiots (not you)
Wtf I’ve been there
Made me wanna move to Germany tbh
/r/CrappyDesign
Millions of people will be exposed to how awful DDG is compared to Google, I’m as anti-Google dominance as anyone and really wish someone with very deep pockets and a passion for privacy would enter search (*cough* Apple)
Such a great day, it's shameful how many have forgotten about the horrors of the GDR
Mitterrand was more opposed to reunification than Thatcher was
I haven't felt this buzz in the air since mid-18th century Paris
> Everywhere in London
The people who get their news about the UK from Reddit and Twitter must have a really twisted view of what is going on here
This protest was confined to the Westminster area
The people supporting it support reversing the referendum by hook or by crook
They are not great defenders of democracy
They're just partisan players like the rest of us
I'm embarrassed at the comparisons to Poland or even to Hong Kong
Oh no
We agree my Polish friend
It won’t. People here just make funny signs and then go home
No it's not
Please get your news from places other than Twitter or Reddit
Lel won't happen
I disagree
Canada has a virtually identical system (including non elected "Lords", or Senators in Canada) and they're doing fine
The current status of the UK is the fault of the British electorate
We have made stupid decisions, been apathetic about our representatives, voted for incompetent people and continued to do so for decades
It seems everywhere on this website everything is blamed on "the system", including in other countries like the US, but when are we going to acknowledge that sometimes the system actually works and that the electorate are to blame
Brexit was a popular vote, not the MPs fault
It was one of the few cases of direct democracy we get here and we used that chance to derail the train
If the average Briton did a 15 minute Google research before voting, everything would be considerably smoother and better
This is the fault of the people being lazy twits who get their information passively from ads displayed on the bus
The UK's constitution was not at all designed to govern an empire, it literally precedes the "vast empire" by 2 centuries (everyone forgets the British "empire" was a tiny thing, mad even tinier by the loss of the USA, before the mid 1800s)
Canada has actually been quite successful with an almost carbon copy model of the UK, the biggest difference being that they adopted proper federalism as opposed to centralized
*head of government, the monarch is the head of state
Longest in the UK's history
Second longest in England's history
I can state with 100% certainty there will not be 'riots'
Me neither
However, we've had 2 Charles' before, the first one caused the civil war
The second one brought back Christmas and stuff after Cromwell banned it and put in lots of other Puritanical laws
You better go quick
UK is leaving interrail at the end of 2019
(Not a joke)
Thanks
Thought we would be leaving
Dude I was about to be so mad
What the fuck is going on
Like if that was real, why are we cutting ties with our closest allies, god I fucking hate old people and i couldn’t care less about this ‘anglosphere’ people love talking about, let’s just hope we get another vote
a threatening bus
Ahhh another EU directive, I wonder how long this one is
The one on cabbages was originally over 26,000 words long
about the same length as George Orwells Animal Farm
Surely this will be Lord of the Rings length
But I thought europe didn't force laws on anyone
It's just a monetary and economic union
that's what we all signed up for
originally right
>At least the Tories will hopefully get what's coming
[B R E X I T  M E A N S  B R E X I T]
Also it was a spike in reported hate crimes rather than hate crimes so it may have been immigration/xenophobia coming to the forefront and being more widely reported on leading to people reporting issues more
To be fair to the British, there isn't really a natural second language to learn here (unless you're speaking about Welsh / gaelic) as English is the universal second language
How does this take into account joblessness, i.e does it mean the person earns 0 or is it not taken into the average
Does anyone have any figures for GDP per capita / average salary for just England
I would be curious to see the difference W I S make (I assume all 3 would reduce the average figures
I so want to move to Iceland right now
Just call me Mr Average
What’re they independent from exactly
Do you know where to find more of these
Thanks
That’s definitely something worth celebrating ~
Thank you
I recognise those cranes from when I was there 10 years ago
Wonder if the public can still use the extremely narrow staircases
As an Englishman, I nominate England
Leave Scotland, Ireland and Wales as they are and turn London into a self ruling island in the extended North Sea
But once London is OK, flood the rest
It would mean that London would have lots of beaches and we could look forward to ferry trips to Wales and Scotland
As for all the people, if we are not allowed to drown them then they should be shipped to the most Trump supporting parts of the USA
They'll feel quite at home there
It is in fact a Scot who has the only [correct reaction] to this
Not my choice, but probably the person we need right now
We need a leader who'll stand up to the EU rather than going along with their attempts to put the wishes of IRA terrorists over the need for a mutually-beneficial relationship
Not a chance, mate
"No surrender" hasn't gone away
I love how Brit-bashers keep making up their own interpretations of the GFA to mean whatever the hell they want
Have you even read the thing
There is literally nothing in there mandating an open border
The UK is leaving the EU and the Customs Union, and that includes NI
If the Republic's membership of the Brussels project is incompatible with keeping the border open, that's their problem, not ours
And the RoI pushing the agenda of a terrorist organisation is precisely why it's such an unreasonable demand
You can't simply demand border-free access to a foreign country for nothing in return
Article 1
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is an inalienable part of the People’s Republic of China

Never heard Lebanese but definitely not French, it just gives off too much
French
It's just so *French*.
Well I'm poking a little bit of fun, but it doesn't have the sex appeal to me it seems to have to a lot of people
It just usually sounds sort of serious
The opposite
I once spent quite a while in Germany, having a German conversation with someone only to discover we were both English
As a Brit living in Germany it happened that I was with a mixed group of people (some Brits, some Germans) and of course we were talking in German
After a while the Germans left yet we Brits carried on talking in German to each other for ages before we realised we didn't need to
>I've never even heard one
How would you know if you had
If they were good enough you wouldn't know they were Brits
When I spoke German (in Bayern) people usually assumed I was Dutch or from some part of North Germany
I guess it's meant to be part of the system, given that most of the Westminster-style legislatures are designed to be adversarial in nature
&#x200B;
From the election system (FPTP which logically would easily lead to a two-party system), to the parliamentary process (the 1-vs-1 question times), and even the physical layout of the chambers (with two sets of benches laid against each other)
&#x200B;
In fact, it seems to me that when we look to (the lower houses of) the other legislatures adopting the Westminster system (such as the Australian House of Representatives, the New Zealand Parliament, the Canadian House of Commons), they are mostly also "chaotic" to varying degrees
Probably the only real exception is the Singaporean Parliament, as the public opinions are so predominantly favouring the PAP and the Government, and the opposition must act in a seemingly very orderly fashion so that they won't give PAP the excuse to blame them for messing the country up
On a note, it also occurs to me to be a bit interesting that in the Dáil, it seems that most of the TDs are not in the chamber during the question times
&#x200B;
For me as an outsider (of Europe), I don't find it problematic as long as the lawmakers are not engaged in physical combat and are able to make their points
Surely though, whether the system benefits or encourages cooperation and real dialogue is another matter
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
This would be a rather long answer LOL
&#x200B;
It is first important to note that (i) the British HK colonial administration and legislature has never acted on purely conventional basis -- unlike Canada or NZ, the HK colonial political system had always been governed by two codified instruments (the Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions); and (ii) the British HK had never experienced full-blown democracy and separation of the executive and the civil service
&#x200B;
The second point is particularly important, in that prior to 1985 (after the signing of the Joint Declaration which decided the sad fate of the city), there were no elections for the LegCo at all, and as far as I understand, LegCo meetings were predominantly held in private, and there were surely no real opposition of any kind
Only until 1991 there were the first seats elected by the general public (i.e. qualification to vote by reaching 21)
Probably the ever only LegCo that could be branded to be fully elected by universal suffrage was the 1995 LegCo, which only served for less than 2 years and triggered terribly negative reactions from Beijing
&#x200B;
From 1842 to 1993 (save the Japanese occupation period during WWII), the President of the LegCo  (i.e. the presiding officer) had always been the Governor himself
It was only after the arrival of Chris Patten (now Baron Patten of Barnes) (following his perhaps surprising defeat in the 1992 General Election while serving as the Tory chairman) there were signs for a fuller scale of democracy
Yet, up until 30 June 1997, even after the 1995 LegCo General Election, the executive power was still in strict control in the hands of the Governor (as agreed by UK and PRC), and all government ministers were still civil servants
There had never been any chance for elected lawmakers to form the government and to takeover the policy-making powers
&#x200B;
Under such circumstances, imaginably, although the pre-handover LegCo largely followed the British parliamentary conventions, there were certain very essential things that surely could not be applied
This would include the  adversarial 1-party-vs-1-party nature of the legislature, the need for any confidence supplied by the legislature for the government to stay in power, any solidly established whipping system, etc
As a result, even though there were still things like question times, it is my understanding that the sentiment was quite different
&#x200B;
After the handover, under the HKSAR Basic Law, the political system went further more akin to a presidential system (as this would be the only way Beijing could tightly control the head of government -- for obvious reasons this could not logically happen under a parliamentary / Westminster system)
Although, still the post-handover LegCo does follow the British parliamentary conventions in some ways, things are still fundamentally different in its logic of operation
Very obviously, there is absolute no hope in forming the government; the by-default unfair electoral system has reduced the pan-Democrats to nothing more than an ever-ineffective parliamentary opposition (as they would never have the majority); several mechanisms have been put in place to make it almost impossible for members to move any meaningful Private Members' Bills
&#x200B;
Under such frustration, the pan-Democrats has gone increasingly radicalised
While some more socially conservative pan-Democrats tend to behave well in the legislature in order to appeal to their middle-class voters who favour orderly and (*prima facie*) civilised parliamentary behaviour; a rising number of pan-Democrats are going more aggressive in the legislature, both procedurally and physically
Sadly, such little room for procedural and physical dissent in the legislature is also diminishing, as (i) the Court of Final Appeal has confirmed the absolute power of the President of LegCo in controlling the procedure of the legislature (so that he could quite arbitrarily end any debate at any time, depart from the Rules of Procedure at any time as he wishes, as so that any filibuster effort would be rendered useless; the President of LegCo also now regularly eject members who are protesting when government officials are entering into the chamber as he considers such "noises" disorderly and disrespectful); and (ii) the government is now criminally prosecuting physically dissenting actions with common street offences such as common assault
&#x200B;
I mean, surely there are still more superficial stuffs that sound like the British parliamentary systems
The order paper of the legislature's business still has an obvious British influence; there are still question times; there are still "divisions" and the "division bell" (both electronic)
But in essence, things are loomingly different
&#x200B;
BTW, the 2 LegCo chambers which have been used since real elections were introduced both have never had the traditional Westminster layout with opposing benches

Hi our twin and forever rival
HDB,
Great place to travel to,
Great food centres and durians,
Lovely musuems and botanic park,
Futuristic and well-planned Mariana Bay,
Decent town planning with trees and good road width (thus a feeling of space),
Many familiar street and place names (many colonial administrators served in and contributed substantially to both SG and HK, e.g. Clementi),
Very competent government with great vision (though LHL seems to be in decline and the guy next in line seems even worse),
No true democracy (with respect),
No true constitutionalism and human rights (with the Wednesbury approach of human rights protection, the doctrine of presumption of constitutionality, the constitutional exclusion of judicial reviews on certain matters, the crazy gerrymandering, the way how the central government treated the WP-won constituencies),
Crazily advanced court facilities (with like a big touch screen computer before each lawyer’s seat at the State Court — WTF that’s amazing),
MRT which is complained nowadays as much as is MTR,
Little India riot,
Majulah Singapura,
Mandatory military duty,
Good friend with PRC while having armies training in Taiwan (that’s a difficult task),
Friends telling me the military is planning at all times of being attacked by Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand
I've always thought Wolfgang - or "Wolf" is a great name for a boy but as a Brit I don't think I could get away with naming my kid that
I would guess the way you phrased "backwards compared to the rest of western Europe" implies putting the UK at the bottom of the pile by a margin
You might not have meant it that way, though
Just in my own head Scandinavia are a separate group and are of course ahead of us in many aspects, but I see our comparable peers as more like France, Germany, maybe Spain etc
For myself, I see western Europe as a mixed bag of a bunch of things and don't see the UK as particularly worse off than others (Brexit aside), despite the fact I will usually shit on lots of stuff about the UK all day
Generally, in secondary schools, better schools would opt to to teach all classes in English (apart from the subjects of Chinese language and Chinese History)
In fact, schools need approval of the Education Bureau to do so
&#x200B;
At university level, virtually the medium of instruction of all degrees are English, save again some majors which are only sensible if taught in Chinese
&#x200B;
In real life practice, how well it works really depends
At secondary school level, I think it is fair to say that even in the best schools, teachers sometimes come across difficulties to go full-fledged English: in some cases it's the deficiency in the teachers' only language competence; in some cases it's the limit in the students' abilities; in some it's both
&#x200B;
At university level, e.g. if you are studying law, you can expect almost every minute of your classes is in English
Being involved in the Iraq war
Brexit
Same here, I went to a mixed school but in secondary all our subjects were gender segregated up until Year 9 and our core subjects all the way up to A Level for
reasons
Just wanna say
yes in Hong Kong, and up to a state where two chains of them have been listed  and  though one of them is now undergoing winding-up lmaoooo
Their notes which I got are better designed then most school textbooks lol
Lots of things but the accent I notice a lot, I almost always notice an American actor doing it and even if they find a British actor they're very often written with no effort to use British phrasing or language
It's jarring to hear *flashlight* and *sneakers* in any British accent
And just to make it even more painful let's chuck in loads of *loves, sweethearts* and *mates* because HEY this is a British character, so they're often somehow simultaneously not British enough and turbo British way over the top
To change it
I'll get us some tea, love, just let me put my trainers on because I need to go to the shops because we've run out
Do you want me to get some crumpets and a fizzy drink or do you want some sweets
But it's a ridiculous sentence in the first place because
tea and crumpets *of course*!
Absolutely, all my other European friends speak that kind of mix, or more American influenced
It doesn't really matter, it's understandable
The only one that gets me is which version of pants they're using, can get quite weird
I'm not a man but the men around me seem to only shake for first time greetings or if it's someone they're not close with
Friends usually get a hug or the handshake + one arm hug thing
I'd say with women the same mostly applies for first time greeting except with posh people over 40 who insist on the awkward handshake and cheek kiss
> Theresa May won’t resign
Err
what
There has been nothing to suggest that's going to happen
What makes you think Corbyn is going to wait until after the recess to table a no-confidence vote
An election this summer is looking more and more likely

Do you have any proof of this
Only in the Scouts, and even then it's usually only a week
Zeitgeist, Leitmotif, Schadenfreude, Frankfurter, Weinerschnitzel, Doppelganger are the first ones I can think of
We finally have a PM willing to stand up to Brussels
There is no such threat
Everyone except bitter ScotNats accepts the mandate of the 2014 vote, and they don't come close to holding a majority in Parliament

Only in the minds of sore loser ScotNats
Boris is the last person who would approve a referendum
He sounds like a fucking idiot
Now it’s a radicalised car park

The least believable bit about this promise is the idea of the current chaotic, limping Tory Government actually managing to enact such a large, ambitious project

>Allies
The EU is not necessary for this
>free money for projects
No such thing as "free money". The UK pays in a lot more than it gets back
>co-operation frameworks
The EU is not necessary for this
>international influence,
The EU actively diminishes this
>collective bargaining with other large trading blocs,
Okay if you're happy with those negotiations being run by unelected neolibs who produce crap like CETA
Many of us would rather trade be determined by our own country
>cheaper access to european goods, medicine, science and specialists
Pushing down income and wages for those producing these things domestically
>It also facilitates mass co-ordination on important issues that effect everyone
For example, banning agricultural practices across the continent that would destroy ecosystems, resulting in mass starvation in the future,
The EU is not necessary for any of this
Nah it's lighting and angles

Good lucky getting NI and Ir to co-join, they fucking hate each others guts
The "deal" puts a customs border between parts of the UK

The fact that that comment with sources is near the bottom while people responding (with no evidence) that most Muslims supported it are being upvoted shows the state of this sub

How times have changed
Perhaps it would have been better if it was the Germans that were responsible

Brussels has spent the last five years vindicating the threats of violence from SF-IRA terrorists demanding no border between separate countries
What did they think was going to happen when they tried imposing a border between two parts of the same country
If you're on about the GFA, there is nothing in it precluding a border between the two Irelands
In fact, the south is enforcing a hard border right now for covid
Have you actually read the GFA
It says no such thing
You can set the text to whatever you want
So the answer is no, you haven't read it
It says no such thing
You're not British
The status of part of the United Kingdom is none of your concern, though it should be patently obvious by now that imposing a border between one part of the UK and another is no way to preserve peace
You are literally in a foreign country
Thousands suffered at the hands of SF-IRA terrorists to defend NI and keep it British
Ulster is, and always will be, British
Are they fucking kidding we are proper screwed now
Hold my Stella bruv we’ll lead the charge
I think you'r mistaken
The current Tories are now the hardcore right wing back benchers that have come crawling out of the rock from the 40s and 50s. They basically want to dismantle all the social and welfare progress made since the Second World War and turn the UK into a neo-American republican state
Say goodbye to workers rights, human rights, healthcare, consumer rights or anything that doesn't benefit the very rich
This has all been led by a massive media campaign since the 80s but especially since 9/11 where everything has been blamed on foreigners or Britons of non white descent and therefore it must all be dismantled
The wealthy right wing media a knew the best way to get the socialism of the mid and late 20th century destroyed was to portray it as a system being abused by non whites and foreigners
They've always hated it, now they just have found a solid way of defeating it
Any problem this country has is whipped up into a frenzy by the media and government as being a problem caused by foreigners and dog whistles of being caused by non white Britons
Coupled with the fact that now the UK has only one right wing party and two or three left wing ones, in a FPTP system that means the right wing win almost all the time
I meant Republican as in American Republicans and all the filth they bring along, definitely not in terms of anti Monarchy
I'm very disappointed in Estonia, Switzerland and Czech Republic
It is they are doing really well with drug abuse
This is pretty much it, you have all the facts
Here's a crazy idea: maybe we could spend our own money, rather than giving it to unaccountable foreigners to spend for us
So 'trustworthy' according to the Germans means 'unquestioningly accepting orders from the Brussels political project'. Good to know
They probably think Trump and the American far right will save them
They basically want to become a right wing version to the US of the left wing version they were to the USSR
I guess they just feel more comfortable being someone’s bitch
Most countries would probably be assaulted by environmentalists if they tried to destroy the habitat like the Dutch did
Even the Dutch, in their glorious hypocrisy, would try to stick in a few words about how wrong it all is
In fact I'm pretty sure China is being assaulted for doing the exact same thing
It's bad when the Chinese do it, barbaric and evil - but it's a technological marvel and proof of supreme intelligence when the Dutch do it
If only I could pinpoint where the mentality switches over
It’s going to be an ironic meme costume for events like this or on Halloween but it won’t be anything genuine
Isolated disasters aren’t disasters
From the first paragraph of that Wikipedia article:
> The Act applied only to England and Wales
The law was extended to Scotland by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 and to Northern Ireland by the **Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982**.
So it wasn't legalised in the whole of the UK until 1982
I have to agree
I love the drinking culture in the UK and I'd go to war to protect a pint of Timothy Taylor, but I'll happily admit that the beer crown belongs to Belgium
It’s also an El Niño year which helps, even soo the earths warmer this year than last - despite that

Bottom lady kept her kind eyes

More delusional fantasy from the usual cybernats
The issue of Scottish independence was settled "for a generation" in 2014
They wouldn't. There is no constitutional basis for regions of the UK to become independent, and even if they did, Scotland wouldn't even come close to meeting Brussels' budget requirements
This is just a nationalist wank-fantasy
Yet entirely accurate
Scotland is British
Scotland voted by a large margin to remain British
If you don't want to be British, you still have 45 days to bugger off elsewhere
Only after a huge austerity programme
[Their budget deficit is more than double the maximum required by the EU]
[Scotland's budget deficit is 7% of GDP] The EU requires a maximum of 3%. The numbers don't lie, unlike ScotNats
> Your foaming nationalism is showing again, as per usual
Hahahaha
Says the lad who posts nothing but foaming nationalism
>I get it, you are sacred, but this is democracy and if people vote to undermine your nationalist project then I'm sorry about that
I'm neither "sacred" not scared
Just fed up of /r/Europe being flooded with anti-British misinformation
You had a vote on your hateful nationalist project a few years ago
Everyone agreed to respect the result
You lost
Haha
Can't refute the numbers, so you just resort to ad hominems and accusations of lying
Flipping out because the facts aren't on your side doesn't do anything to help your (non-existent) argument
Also, fucking LOL at the idea of /r/Scotland being a reliable source
>I don't post nationalism
I'm not a nationalist
You post nothing but ScotNat bile about breaking up the United Kingdom
Imagine having such little self-awareness
>What is misinformation about this
In this particular case, the idea that regions of the UK can vote to become independent (or that they would even want to)
>Oh, that's right
Nothing
You just got raging because you are a nationalist
Haha
I'm just here stating the facts
If you want to flip out because you're being called out for the hateful nationalist you are, that's on you
Hmm, do I believe a reliable international news organisation like Reuters, or some angry ScotNat on reddit throwing a hissy fit
It's a toughie
You're accusing Reuters of lying because it's reporting the actual figures rather than your warped interpretation of them
I don't think you're in a position to be calling anyone dim
Scotland has a devolved government which has control over how much it spends
Rather than making a case for independence by showing any kind of fiscal responsibility, it simply spends every single penny of English taxpayers' money it receives on freebies
Hilarious that you post nothing but lies then accuse everyone else of lying once you get called out

Sad to see there are still so many people who don't understand that the British people want no part in Brussels' ideological project
"Hundreds of thousands" is significantly fewer than 17
4 million
You know how democracy works, right
Because it's quite clear that Brussels and its cultists don't.
This chart is meaningless
It just shows which countries test the most
Its because, not everyone in (far-right party) is racist, but all the racists vote for (far-right party)
and the party always knows this and exploits it to get the racists votes
And people construe that as racists in itself

Leave Scotland, Ireland and Wales as they are and turn London into a self ruling island in the extended North Sea
But once London is OK, flood the rest
It would mean that London would have lots of beaches and we could look forward to ferry trips to Wales and Scotland
As for all the people, if we are not allowed to drown them then they should be shipped to the most Trump supporting parts of the USA
They'll feel quite at home there
It is in fact a Scot who has the only [correct reaction] to this
Not my choice, but probably the person we need right now
We need a leader who'll stand up to the EU rather than going along with their attempts to put the wishes of IRA terrorists over the need for a mutually-beneficial relationship
Not a chance, mate
"No surrender" hasn't gone away
I love how Brit-bashers keep making up their own interpretations of the GFA to mean whatever the hell they want
Have you even read the thing
There is literally nothing in there mandating an open border
The UK is leaving the EU and the Customs Union, and that includes NI
If the Republic's membership of the Brussels project is incompatible with keeping the border open, that's their problem, not ours
And the RoI pushing the agenda of a terrorist organisation is precisely why it's such an unreasonable demand
You can't simply demand border-free access to a foreign country for nothing in return

The opposite
I once spent quite a while in Germany, having a German conversation with someone only to discover we were both English
As a Brit living in Germany it happened that I was with a mixed group of people (some Brits, some Germans) and of course we were talking in German
After a while the Germans left yet we Brits carried on talking in German to each other for ages before we realised we didn't need to
>I've never even heard one
How would you know if you had
If they were good enough you wouldn't know they were Brits
When I spoke German (in Bayern) people usually assumed I was Dutch or from some part of North Germany
I guess it's meant to be part of the system, given that most of the Westminster-style legislatures are designed to be adversarial in nature
&#x200B;
From the election system (FPTP which logically would easily lead to a two-party system), to the parliamentary process (the 1-vs-1 question times), and even the physical layout of the chambers (with two sets of benches laid against each other)
&#x200B;
In fact, it seems to me that when we look to (the lower houses of) the other legislatures adopting the Westminster system (such as the Australian House of Representatives, the New Zealand Parliament, the Canadian House of Commons), they are mostly also "chaotic" to varying degrees
Probably the only real exception is the Singaporean Parliament, as the public opinions are so predominantly favouring the PAP and the Government, and the opposition must act in a seemingly very orderly fashion so that they won't give PAP the excuse to blame them for messing the country up
On a note, it also occurs to me to be a bit interesting that in the Dáil, it seems that most of the TDs are not in the chamber during the question times
&#x200B;
For me as an outsider (of Europe), I don't find it problematic as long as the lawmakers are not engaged in physical combat and are able to make their points
Surely though, whether the system benefits or encourages cooperation and real dialogue is another matter
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
This would be a rather long answer LOL
&#x200B;
It is first important to note that (i) the British HK colonial administration and legislature has never acted on purely conventional basis -- unlike Canada or NZ, the HK colonial political system had always been governed by two codified instruments (the Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions); and (ii) the British HK had never experienced full-blown democracy and separation of the executive and the civil service

&#x200B;
I mean, surely there are still more superficial stuffs that sound like the British parliamentary systems
The order paper of the legislature's business still has an obvious British influence; there are still question times; there are still "divisions" and the "division bell" (both electronic)
But in essence, things are loomingly different

At secondary school level, I think it is fair to say that even in the best schools, teachers sometimes come across difficulties to go full-fledged English: in some cases it's the deficiency in the teachers' only language competence; in some cases it's the limit in the students' abilities; in some it's both
&#x200B;
At university level, e.g. if you are studying law, you can expect almost every minute of your classes is in English
Being involved in the Iraq war
Brexit
Same here, I went to a mixed school but in secondary all our subjects were gender segregated up until Year 9 and our core subjects all the way up to A Level for
reasons
Just wanna say
yes in Hong Kong, and up to a state where two chains of them have been listed  and  though one of them is now undergoing winding-up lmaoooo
Their notes which I got are better designed then most school textbooks lol
Lots of things but the accent I notice a lot, I almost always notice an American actor doing it and even if they find a British actor they're very often written with no effort to use British phrasing or language
It's jarring to hear *flashlight* and *sneakers* in any British accent
And just to make it even more painful let's chuck in loads of *loves, sweethearts* and *mates* because HEY this is a British character, so they're often somehow simultaneously not British enough and turbo British way over the top
To change it
I'll get us some tea, love, just let me put my trainers on because I need to go to the shops because we've run out
Do you want me to get some crumpets and a fizzy drink or do you want some sweets
But it's a ridiculous sentence in the first place because
tea and crumpets *of course*!
Absolutely, all my other European friends speak that kind of mix, or more American influenced
It doesn't really matter, it's understandable
The only one that gets me is which version of pants they're using, can get quite weird
I'm not a man but the men around me seem to only shake for first time greetings or if it's someone they're not close with
Friends usually get a hug or the handshake + one arm hug thing
I'd say with women the same mostly applies for first time greeting except with posh people over 40 who insist on the awkward handshake and cheek kiss
> Theresa May won’t resign
Err
what
There has been nothing to suggest that's going to happen
What makes you think Corbyn is going to wait until after the recess to table a no-confidence vote
An election this summer is looking more and more likely
When
Do you have any proof of this
Only in the Scouts, and even then it's usually only a week
Zeitgeist, Leitmotif, Schadenfreude, Frankfurter, Weinerschnitzel, Doppelganger are the first ones I can think of
We finally have a PM willing to stand up to Brussels
There is no such threat
Everyone except bitter ScotNats accepts the mandate of the 2014 vote, and they don't come close to holding a majority in Parliament
It only exists in the minds of deluded redditors
Only in the minds of sore loser ScotNats
Boris is the last person who would approve a referendum
He sounds like a fucking idiot
Now it’s a radicalised car park
German cars only
lmao what the fuck
The least believable bit about this promise is the idea of the current chaotic, limping Tory Government actually managing to enact such a large, ambitious project
Need more livers from drinking scotch in their library’s
>Allies
The EU is not necessary for this
>free money for projects
No such thing as "free money". The UK pays in a lot more than it gets back
>co-operation frameworks
The EU is not necessary for this
>international influence,
The EU actively diminishes this
>collective bargaining with other large trading blocs,
Okay if you're happy with those negotiations being run by unelected neolibs who produce crap like CETA
Many of us would rather trade be determined by our own country
>cheaper access to european goods, medicine, science and specialists
Pushing down income and wages for those producing these things domestically
>It also facilitates mass co-ordination on important issues that effect everyone
For example, banning agricultural practices across the continent that would destroy ecosystems, resulting in mass starvation in the future,
The EU is not necessary for any of this
Nah it's lighting and angles
/r/Instagramreality
Please don't inject toxic politics into this by separating regions like Scotland from the rest of the country
The United Kingdom is a single country and has been for over 300 years
What the fuck is this
I can only wish he becomes the leader of Russia one day; and bring prosperity to it
There were two other notable candidates just out of shot (aside from the honourable Lord Buckethead), one was a guy in old-timey pilots gear who was listed on the ballot as a time lord, the other was a guy wearing a "Epstein didn't commit suicide" shirt while on stage
England bad
Upvotes to the left
Good lucky getting NI and Ir to co-join, they fucking hate each others guts
The "deal" puts a customs border between parts of the UK
Not exactly hard to see why that's a problem
Yeah
The fact that that comment with sources is near the bottom while people responding (with no evidence) that most Muslims supported it are being upvoted shows the state of this sub
So you're telling me this country could resist the might of the German Luftwaffe during the height of their power but can't deal with a droney boi
How times have changed
Perhaps it would have been better if it was the Germans that were responsible
It’s why it really is phenomenal how safe air travel is
And why Boeing are in huge trouble over the 737 Max because ...pardon the pun but that shit just doesn’t fly in the aviation industry in modern times
Looks like somewhere the Darth Vader would live
You mean it’s like a mini PS5 lel
Where isa da peeeza
I think it was more like:
> Napoleon has entered the chat
Every time I see people celebrating warm winter days I feel like we should be celebrating the last remaining normal days of traditional winter
I could sit there all evening with a warm drink and chat all night
I need to be there D:
Brussels has spent the last five years vindicating the threats of violence from SF-IRA terrorists demanding no border between separate countries
What did they think was going to happen when they tried imposing a border between two parts of the same country
If you're on about the GFA, there is nothing in it precluding a border between the two Irelands
In fact, the south is enforcing a hard border right now for covid
Have you actually read the GFA
It says no such thing
You can set the text to whatever you want
So the answer is no, you haven't read it
It says no such thing
You're not British
The status of part of the United Kingdom is none of your concern, though it should be patently obvious by now that imposing a border between one part of the UK and another is no way to preserve peace
You are literally in a foreign country
Thousands suffered at the hands of SF-IRA terrorists to defend NI and keep it British
Ulster is, and always will be, British
Are they fucking kidding we are proper screwed now
Hold my Stella bruv we’ll lead the charge
I think you'r mistaken
The current Tories are now the hardcore right wing back benchers that have come crawling out of the rock from the 40s and 50s. They basically want to dismantle all the social and welfare progress made since the Second World War and turn the UK into a neo-American republican state
Say goodbye to workers rights, human rights, healthcare, consumer rights or anything that doesn't benefit the very rich
This has all been led by a massive media campaign since the 80s but especially since 9/11 where everything has been blamed on foreigners or Britons of non white descent and therefore it must all be dismantled
The wealthy right wing media a knew the best way to get the socialism of the mid and late 20th century destroyed was to portray it as a system being abused by non whites and foreigners
They've always hated it, now they just have found a solid way of defeating it
Any problem this country has is whipped up into a frenzy by the media and government as being a problem caused by foreigners and dog whistles of being caused by non white Britons
Coupled with the fact that now the UK has only one right wing party and two or three left wing ones, in a FPTP system that means the right wing win almost all the time
I meant Republican as in American Republicans and all the filth they bring along, definitely not in terms of anti Monarchy
I'm very disappointed in Estonia, Switzerland and Czech Republic
It is they are doing really well with drug abuse
This is pretty much it, you have all the facts
Here's a crazy idea: maybe we could spend our own money, rather than giving it to unaccountable foreigners to spend for us
So 'trustworthy' according to the Germans means 'unquestioningly accepting orders from the Brussels political project'. Good to know
They probably think Trump and the American far right will save them
They basically want to become a right wing version to the US of the left wing version they were to the USSR
I guess they just feel more comfortable being someone’s bitch
Most countries would probably be assaulted by environmentalists if they tried to destroy the habitat like the Dutch did
Even the Dutch, in their glorious hypocrisy, would try to stick in a few words about how wrong it all is
In fact I'm pretty sure China is being assaulted for doing the exact same thing
It's bad when the Chinese do it, barbaric and evil - but it's a technological marvel and proof of supreme intelligence when the Dutch do it
If only I could pinpoint where the mentality switches over
It’s going to be an ironic meme costume for events like this or on Halloween but it won’t be anything genuine
Isolated disasters aren’t disasters
From the first paragraph of that Wikipedia article:
> The Act applied only to England and Wales
The law was extended to Scotland by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 and to Northern Ireland by the **Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982**.
So it wasn't legalised in the whole of the UK until 1982
I have to agree
I love the drinking culture in the UK and I'd go to war to protect a pint of Timothy Taylor, but I'll happily admit that the beer crown belongs to Belgium
It’s also an El Niño year which helps, even soo the earths warmer this year than last - despite that
They all aged very well
Bottom lady kept her kind eyes
Last guy kept this put-together look
More delusional fantasy from the usual cybernats
The issue of Scottish independence was settled "for a generation" in 2014
They wouldn't. There is no constitutional basis for regions of the UK to become independent, and even if they did, Scotland wouldn't even come close to meeting Brussels' budget requirements
This is just a nationalist wank-fantasy
Yet entirely accurate
Scotland is British
Scotland voted by a large margin to remain British
If you don't want to be British, you still have 45 days to bugger off elsewhere
Only after a huge austerity programme
[Their budget deficit is more than double the maximum required by the EU]
[Scotland's budget deficit is 7% of GDP] The EU requires a maximum of 3%. The numbers don't lie, unlike ScotNats
> Your foaming nationalism is showing again, as per usual
Hahahaha
Says the lad who posts nothing but foaming nationalism
>I get it, you are sacred, but this is democracy and if people vote to undermine your nationalist project then I'm sorry about that
I'm neither "sacred" not scared
Just fed up of /r/Europe being flooded with anti-British misinformation
You had a vote on your hateful nationalist project a few years ago
Everyone agreed to respect the result
You lost
Haha
Can't refute the numbers, so you just resort to ad hominems and accusations of lying
Flipping out because the facts aren't on your side doesn't do anything to help your (non-existent) argument
Also, fucking LOL at the idea of /r/Scotland being a reliable source
>I don't post nationalism
I'm not a nationalist
You post nothing but ScotNat bile about breaking up the United Kingdom
Imagine having such little self-awareness
>What is misinformation about this
In this particular case, the idea that regions of the UK can vote to become independent (or that they would even want to)
>Oh, that's right
Nothing
You just got raging because you are a nationalist
Haha
I'm just here stating the facts
If you want to flip out because you're being called out for the hateful nationalist you are, that's on you
Hmm, do I believe a reliable international news organisation like Reuters, or some angry ScotNat on reddit throwing a hissy fit
It's a toughie
You're accusing Reuters of lying because it's reporting the actual figures rather than your warped interpretation of them
I don't think you're in a position to be calling anyone dim
Scotland has a devolved government which has control over how much it spends
Rather than making a case for independence by showing any kind of fiscal responsibility, it simply spends every single penny of English taxpayers' money it receives on freebies
Hilarious that you post nothing but lies then accuse everyone else of lying once you get called out
Luxembourg is smaller than Texas [citation needed]
Rich/middle class, or inherited
This is in a affluent county
I live in the village, our thatch almost caught fire because of the bonfire
And a Three Cocks in Wales
I assume it refers to roosters though with the Welsh you can never quite be sure
Reminds me of [this]
They were good, but they raised shitty kids and the next generation (their children, most likely your parents) will take it all away from you if you continue to not give a fuck
How long do you think what they built will last
I see no reason why someone can't bash communism but also bash the fucked up system the US has
They are both evil
I think we should, why didn’t you invest in Eastern Poland
Eurocrats still bitter that we voted not to be their cash cow anymore
Keep crying, it's hilarious
Indeed
Sad to see there are still so many people who don't understand that the British people want no part in Brussels' ideological project
"Hundreds of thousands" is significantly fewer than 17
4 million
You know how democracy works, right
Because it's quite clear that Brussels and its cultists don't.
This chart is meaningless
It just shows which countries test the most
Its because, not everyone in (far-right party) is racist, but all the racists vote for (far-right party)
and the party always knows this and exploits it to get the racists votes
And people construe that as racists in itself
The world really is ending when the Germans start making decent jokes
Government can't afford to pay tuition fees in England because of all the money sent to Scotland to fund their freebies
I loved these as a child
I'm 35 now and I've still got my old Asterix books on my bookshelf
I think I've got around 75% of the pre-1990 books
I’m an introvert so actually prefer rainy cold days in with no socialising
Same in London, summer has been the classic second winter
That is total nonsense
Having concerns about the levels of immigration not even remotely close to hating particular nationalites
UK Independence bad
UpJunckers to the left
Beautiful
No, not 'everywhere in London', just a small bunch of sore losers
As for 'save our democracy', don't make me fucking laugh
They remember which side won the referendum, right
Don't worry, if the Brexit we voted for isn't delivered, there'll be riots
Come Out, Ye Black And Tans is an eternal banger - and I’m English
You know people can live in countries other than the one they were born in right
Aw sound, I wasn’t aware actually - thanks for letting me know
