nothing I just like chaos plus europe would have an interesting geography
Yes
I am way worse at translating now
I know the words in both languages, but because I almost never use Greek online, I have to use Google Translate to remind me of my own language's words
No, because it's very close to actual English and because I learbt with it, it's hard for me to even immitate other accents including the Greek accent
>Many of the sounds english have just don't exist in Spanish and they seem to vary a lot and pronuntiation looks random
This is also a problem for  (Greek) Cypriots . We only have 5 vowel (a,e,i,o,u) sounds where as english has more than 10
For us its very hard to even recognise the difference between 2 similar vowels let alone try to pronounce them
For mainland Greeks its even harder since the don't distinguish between s and sh , tz and j , ts and ch and also z and zh
However native greek speakers have an advantage when it comes to the th sounds since we use them both in our native language
Lmao, no it’s not
The Cypriot accent is just pronouncing everything the way you see it written, but over pronouncing them, and emphasising the consonants
That’s what I’ve heard
No I'm not talking about the cypriot accent
I have a very close to English accent personally, even though I'm not even English
Ohhhh
Same in Greek Universities

Yeah, there were gonna be more, but I got bored
Sorry
Basically all funny outdated sounding Ancient Greek names
Funny enough, I met quite a lot of people with the above names
Also I apologise if the transliteration was bad
Yes it happens
At my workplace the company language is English
So we write all emails and communications in English
So imagine that for 8 hours a day I am fully immersed in English
When the odd email arrives from a Greek speaker or an external person and I have to reply in Greek, my mind freezes and I can't even compose a Greek email
And Imagine that I am really good in Greek Language
I even got awards for essay writings and the top mark in the final high school examination
Ummm
Yet, there are some words that I know in English/French(sometimes) that I might not know in Greek, but that rarely happens, as Greek is the language I’m best at, and more confortable with
1) Cyprus has only been (independent and) free for 14 years
2) Since 1963 when Turkish Cypriots left the governmental bodies and the Parliament, their seats in the Parliament remain there empty
3) Currently 3% of Cyprus is (two) Sovereign British Bases(UK), 36,7% of Cyprus is occupied by Turkey, 5% of Cyprus was given to the UN Peacekeeping Force and the rest is under the control of the Republic of Cyprus
4) Oldest known evidence of Cat taming was found in Cyprus not in Egypt (also the population of cats is higher than human population)
5) Greek Goddess Aphrodite was born from the foam in the waters of Cyprus
She arose from the foam when the Titan Cronus slew his father Uranus and threw his genitals into the sea
True, Luxembourgish and Turkish are the only two official languages of EU members but are not official in EU
It seems to be that the Qatar World Cup has been on the news for the last 5 years, and it's still a year away
Just how far in advance to they start building those stadiums
Anyway, I don't even think the Olympics should be a thing, and this is a good 25 times worse, obviously I'd like to have nothing to do with it
But I doubt Cyprus participates in the World Cup
You forgot us :(
We exist
Cyprus too
Same here
Main reason I haven't gone to the US is because im not going to be at the whim of some douche

To ban souvla and halloumi
Hahaha xd
Halloumi will most likely change in the next years for people outside of Cyprus
Used to, in Cyprus and Finland, but not in the Netherlands or Germany
Never really seen real snow
I would say that "still" is not even the right word for Cyprus
The island was not very directly involved in WW2, nor had any prior history with the Germans
There are stereotypes introduced by cultural transmission (via Greek and British cultural contacts), and some negative associations with austerity measures in 2013 but they are neither deeply rooted or particularly pronounced
There isn't an anti-German sentiment about wwii, ~~there is one tho about STEALING OUR FUCKING MONEY~~ ...I mean
there is none
I have a Belgian friend, and she told me her parents were very uncomfortable with her moving to Germany, and that she herself is still triggered by the stereotypical "Aryan" look some German men naturally sport
Cyprus didn't have universal healthcare until last June, and it's still not fully implemented (in-patient care under the new system will start this June), but so far I am very happy with how it works out, as a person who had to pay up to 600EUR out of pocket every year before, and had to wait for months to get an appointment (under the new system, the most I waited was two days, and my taxes went up a little bit, but over all I pay less for healthcare per year)
&#x200B;
[Here's how it will work when fully implemented

We put our toilet paper in a bin
Βοθρατζης (poop collector or something, I couldn’t find the word in English) or Trash collector
They actually get paid well, yet we still use it, presumably due to the unpopularity of the job
We also have the phrase « illiterate man, undressed timber» which is so cliché. Every primary school teacher would say this
I think people should be free to pursue whatever they want
I really don’t understand the stigma behind all of this
All jobs are important and they all contribute to society
Just let them be
Yeah, some jobs contribute more than other
What
Did they really ask you to *take their son’s virginity
Did you not report them or something
Oh sorry, I misunderstood your comment
it still remains a weird thing to say to someone
also, I’ve never heard that french girls are easy
where did that come from
Oh ok
Thanks
This isn't a translation, rather a guy that can't translate, but it's still mentionworthy here because it's hillarious and kinda relevant
In a gameshow called "Ο πιο αδύναμος κρίκος" ("the weakest link" i think it is in English), the host said the question "Ποιος είναι ο πρωταγωνιστής της σειράς ταινιών "Missio Ipossibo", Αδύνατη Αποστολή ("Who is the Protagonist of the movie series "Mission Impossible" (but he said it in a way which wasn't that clear))
The guy that was playing was a teacher but didn't understand it well, I persume, so he said "πόσιμπολ" "possibol" and got memed to shit for an entire year by the whole country
The worst translations in Greek are those who keep the foreign language's (usually English) word order
Yeah it makes sense because you see the words individually and piece the meaning together, but it's a word salad
If I read "SSD δίσκοι" or "Android κινητά" one more time
The one who made me drop a book right away though was translating the English word 'free' with the Greek word for gratis, instead of the one for libre
It was the entire point of the book, and if the translator didn't do enough research to get that right, then why would I trust the rest of their translation
Article 1
The State of Cyprus is an independent and sovereign Republic with a presidential regime, the President being Greek and the Vice-President being Turk elected by the Greek and the Turkish Communities of Cyprus respectively as hereinafter in this Constitution provided
I doubt it will happen in the end, but it will be a true mess if it's not the same as both Greece and Turkey
If it happens, we should all be in the same, be it +2 or +3, [to avoid what happened in 2016]
It only lasted for one period
During that winter with half of Cyprus on +3, a horrific traffic accident happened that was attributed to the timezone change:
> But on Tuesday the debate took on a more sombre tone when bus carrying children to school in the north of the island collided with a lorry, killing the driver and two teenage girls
> Protests erupted, led by angry students, who blamed the accident on the fact that it is now darker in the mornings than it was before
Unions have announced a series of strikes, with protests outside the prime minister’s office calling for resignations of several ministers
During that winter, after the incidient, the authorities in the northern side changed the working hours to compensate for the lost day light, and next winter they switched to following EET with a DST change at the same day as the southern side
There's no unanimity and no urgency
EU27 is not known to embrace the "move fast and break things" approach to doing things
"Died in committee" is more EU's style
> switched from left-hand side to right-hand side driving on the road
If politics stay in the current trajectory, it's entirely conceivable that this would happen to northern Cyprus too and it's going to be stranger than fiction
There isn't really more traffic in the evening in Cyprus, but we are also just discussing perceptions: that experiment in 2016 was met with public hostility
The oldest(most ancient) pet cat(domestic cat) was found in Cyprus (not Egypt
And in the world right
First known*
It's kind of too wide for a question
It's normal I guess
Right now is pretty hot too
Im lying in bed and freezing
Granted im a bit on a mountain, but the heatwave went away and im freezing in the morning
Well I am not in Cyprus right now do I thought it was like that xD
Yeah I can imagine :)
I’m sorry i think you accidentally added a “n’t” to
>I don’t like eating kebab
Assuming you mean what shape for the Latin 'a' when writing by hand:
Usually ɑ. Sometimes ⲁ. a never comes out right
I think most Greeks write α by making a circle and then and a ι with or without lifting the pen
Some people do write α the way you described it but they are probably a minority
Why displace them like they did with us in the 1920s of course
What a way to annex land
Move everyone you dont like
I don’t think Cyprus has any best kept secrets, so imma use Greece
Ermoupolis, Ioannina, Methoni, Gytheion, Xanthi, Kavala
Some of them are to some extent known, but not very much, as other areas like Corfu, Chania, Rhodes etc
I’m not even gonna mention the absurdity of Thera and Mykonos
We've basically been consuming Greek media  since forever
Cyprus is a tiny country with a very small number of local productions and a small music industry
So, our talented people go to Greece to find success
That's why our creative industries are intertwined
We watch the same TV series, films, listen to the same artists etc
Even in talent shows and really shows,  it is extremely common for Cypriot contestants to participate in Greek shows (like The Voice, Big Brother, Survivor etc
) As I said above our media industries are so intertwined that both Cypriot and Greek Artists represent each other in Eurovision
That being said, the last few years there are more and more co-productions (Cyprus and Greece)
In the past, everything was filmed in Greece
Nowadays with co-productions there are numerous TV series that are filmed in both countries with both Greek and Cypriot actors
We also have some local productions
So every TV seasons there going to be 5-6 Cypriot shows and 10 Greek shows (that number is just to show the analogy
I have no idea about the actual number)
As far as the news are concerned we are certainly well informed about Greek politics but they are not so much mentioned in the news
Although we share the creative industries, we have so much going on on a local level that our news are more domestic with a few news from Greece and the international scene
However, the gossip TV shows that are displayed in the afternoon are full with Greek celebrities stories

Thanks for the more thorough response
I am a radio and newspaper person, and on those, news from Greece feature very little, not much more than other international news stories
Are you Turkish or Bulgarian
Sometimes I'm not even convinced they really are the lesser evil as time goes by
The progressive half of the political spectrum in Cyprus is practically empty
7% but very thankfully on the decline as it was close to 65% in 2000
Some websites give lower numbers, IDK why
Nah Serbia Greece and Russia are higher
My sources may be flawed**********
That many asterisks are needed because people may give varied answers or studies may not be complete
Yeah soz I'm stupid
I believe i saw it somewhere, hold on
I don't know if I'm entirely truthful, but some studies have it different, I guess the study I saw was the men, i shluld have mentioned that, but it'd be estimated to about over 40% for adults
Studies aren't very specific
Each one I find gas a different value
For my country, I'd say less than 1%, because of how religious literally everyone is
The only women I've seen topless, are grandmas from central or Western europe and it is quite a few
I'd say 10%
Though, I would Google an exchange student’s name to find who they are on social media, (as they are a stranger), I certainly wouldn’t brag about it, and would definitely not mention something as personal as a close relative let alone a parent passing away
I’m not native, though I did study English Literature as an IGCSE (my exams were cancelled) at the english school i go to, so I understand everything (Though I suppose you don’t really need to have studied English Literature to understand Shakespearian English, due to its similarities to modern English) apart from old and Middle English
I still wonder how that’s connected to modern English or even Shakespearian English
Scottish seems to the most part understandable
Ps the first extract you provided us with is from Macbeth
Very recognisable
I love that part
It’s so funny how Birnam Wood literally goes to Dunsinane hill
I’d love to do the same thing with Katharevousa Greek, Attic Greek, Koine Greek, Medieval Greek and maybe the Pontic Dialect, but unfortunately I think it wouldn’t work as few would have any knowledge of the forementioned forms of the Greek language
EME is mostly okay, and ME requires some extra effort
Still, less effort than what I need to exert when I read Greek from that time (Medieval Greek)
Obviously OE is totally opaque to me
> I’d love to do the same thing with Katharevousa Greek, Attic Greek, Koine Greek, Medieval Greek and maybe the Pontic Dialect, but unfortunately I think it wouldn’t work as few would have any knowledge of the forementioned forms of the Greek language
Do you think such a post would make sense in /r/AskEurope, or will it be only Greek Cypriots and Greek answering
For one, I find Medieval Greek already removed enough from Modern Greek that I struggle to understand it (recognise words, sure - but what did they mean back then
That’s exactly why
It wouldn’t be possible to do something similar but with the Greek language
Maybe it helps that I know some French, so ME spelling is not surprising
The main factor with Greek is that from the beginning of the Hellenistic period up until ~1980s, it always used some sort of artificially ancient-sounding and purified from loanwords version of the language as the written standard
It's only in the last half century that written and spoken Greek resemble each other
That's called diglossia, and modern examples include Finland and Norway
In Cyprus bonfires are associated with Easter were young people make big piles of wood close to a church and light them up at Good Saturday night after the message of Christ's resurrection
Traditionally an idol or something  that represents Judas is burnt in it
This is a dangerous "tradition" which the police tries to prevent
We've had a lot intercommunal conflicts where Greek and Turkish nationalists would not only clash with one another but also with members of their own communities that were viewed as "traitors" .
One of the most famous ones  was that of 1963-1964
It was a series of clashes between Greek and Turkish Cypriots that resulted in the death of hundreds of Greek and Turkish Cypriots and the displacement of thousands more .
You can find more information about it at:
A Cypriot that doesn't eat souvla
That's not me of course ;)
Sun: Hλιος - Helios (male, an ancient greek god)
Moon: Φεγγάρι - neutral
Or another word is Σελήνη Selene female (ancient greek goddess of the Moon, sister of Helios)
Sun:
Ο ήλιος (Helios- male)
Moon:
Η Σελήνη (Selene- female)/ το φεγγάρι (Fengari- neutral)
It would have to be during Frankish (1192-1489) and Venetian rule (1489–1571)
Lots of huge gothic Cathedrals, fancy castles and wall fortifications, Venetian palazzos, language flourished, Petrarchism etc
This lovely story completely and abruptly ended in 1571 (when the ottomans won the siege of Famagusta
Unfortunately not many records such as poems art and buildings etc have survived)
Then, we have the 90s up until ~2010, that was a great period for Cyprus, and there was a lot of wealth
(Referring to the Republic of Cyprus, dunno about the occupied areas)
Ottoman period saw a lot of representation of the different religious and ethnic groups extended, too
Not to mention the libraries, bathhouses, roads, aqueducts, and other Ottoman buildings that were influenced by the existing Gothic architecture
Venetian rule brought a lot of trade to the island
Yeah, but it’s evident that the Venetian and Frankish periods were the most prosperous
The Roman Empire was part of the history of most european nations
I most definitely agree
The Italian peninsula was the first area to become “Roman” and thus was the most important possession and hub of the Roman Empire, and by extent where most Roman cities were
Still though, Rome did not stop in Italy, and expanded
Napoleon is part of Italian history btw, but yeah got your point
Not really those are just « name translations », that kinda make things easier
They did that a lot in the past and in almost all languages regarding any name of any ethnicity
people don’t really do that anymore
In case you are referring to Carolus Magnus or Charlemagne, then I will agree he had no right to claim Kingship of Rome
If you are also referring to « La Joconde », then you are also right, they shouldn’t claim it
Hmmm
Yeah maybe in Italian
I’m generally speaking here
In Greek Voltaire for example is called Βολταίρος (Voltairos)
But we don’t do this with all names
Not much history, it happened a few years ago, bit I'm gonna say it
There was a play set to premiere in my small, little village, which play was organized by the Cyprus Theatre Organisation (THOC) itself
We are very very very religious and the play was a play about gay men kissing or something like that
The priests didn't like it
They banned the play from performing and a few days later, THOC kicked us out of the partnership which my mother herself tried so hard to bring to the village
We became the laughing stock to the ENTIRE NATION
EPIC
Cyprus btw
Oh yeah I remember this
The play was well received in Nicosia but somewhere in Famagusta people protested right
I mean I don't remember the village but I think it was in the Famagusta district
Deutsch, Mandarin
As basically the biggest economic power in Europe, we have to learn German in order to basically survive in post-UK EU
As a rising economic power and already the second biggest without even unleasing its full potential, China is looking like the next great superpower, soon passing the US, and with the rapid urbanisation, it's going to be difficult to compete without the support of the Chinese Market
They day will come when everyone will be speaking mandarin and the world will only have one nation: "Zhongguo"
A bit cynical, but I have to thank Greece for blackmailing the rest of the European Union in admitting Cyprus as a member state even though we had no reason to be there
It really improved my quality of life and allowed me to pursue opportunities that would be harder to come by if I didn't have freedom of movement
[Efxaristoumi Atina, efxaristoumi Ellada]
I think if a person from Mainland Greece gets enough exposure he will understand Cypriot Greek
We of course understand you as this is the language we are taught, hear on the news and read
I was amazed once to hear a guy from Rodos
They speak a dialect extremely close to us
Ι agree with you
r/europe isn't really a place to discuss things in a healthy and respectful manner
Lemesos/Ayia Napa(and Protaras)
I mean, yeah, it is Cyprus
if you want a good hotel, you're gonna go to Limassol and if you want a good beach you're gonna go to the South-East, where there are a lot of beaches but they are way overblown with the amount of tourists they get
they support our country A LOT, but still, they're not as good as tourists have been told
The beaches are small amd usually uncoordinated, you will hardly find a hotel big or good enough close to the beach, services are jack shit
usually
If you are going to come to Cyprus, do go to these destinations, because they're not bad as well, but also go on a trip to the mountains
There are a lot of tours around the island and especially around the beaches and Akamas peninsula, but there hardly ever is a tour to Troodos mountain, but at least when there is there are quite a few people going
In our mountains you can find so many types of animals, non-British trees and imo good services, such as restaurants,tour guides and even 1 skiing place I believe
you can go see Saint Nicholas and Agros, 2 places that make our bottled water but also have amazing hotels and tour grpups, as the beaty of the places is just phenomenal
in the mountains outside Limassol, idk exactly where, but, there is a wonderful art Museum about the history of Cyprus
So yeah, beaches isn't everything we've got
Larnaca doesn't have that good beaches, but yep, still amazing
people from Larnaca are arguably the most civilized in Cyprus and that's amazing
They also have the Camel park in Mazotos which is amazing
We don't get many tourists from scotland
nost are English and Russian
in the latest years A LOT OF RUSSIANS
There's no such thing as "normal" in Cyprus
Seriously tho, yeah
it's because Larnaca and Nicosia are cinsidered by us Cypriots as well to be more civilized and less mad about tourism
Limassol, Paphos, Ayia Napa, they need to put all those signs because tourism
Ayia Napa entirely bases itself on tourism so I mean they kinda need to have the signs
But yeah ik what you mean
Larnaca is more "nornal" so to say
Of course I know him
It is me
Not really
I was referring more to the fact that us Cypriots love arguing about stuff, especially politics
Plus I am a Turkish Cypriot :p
Isn't kiss in Swedish piss and piss in swddish kiss or smth
Idk
Well in history class it was easy to memorise one of the reasons why Arabs/British/Turks/Latins/French etc wanted and got control of Cyprus, the geographical position
It was back in the 90s...
Ever since the 2000s, everyobe owns either a Japanese or a German car
There's a traditional song we learn as a children which is gory as hell
Four plus four equals eight,
Four young men are going to the battle
Searching for water high on the mountains,
They find a 100 fathom deep pond
They draw lots on who will go down,
And the one who loses is the youngest one
"Tie me tight my brothers, for i will go down,
I will get the water out of the deep pond".
His brothers tie him tight,
They get him inside the pond
"Get me out my brothers, for i have found the water,
But it looks red, and black, and poisonous".
Until they pull him up and get him out,
The serpents and the snakes have half-eaten him
"Tell my dear mother to dress in black,
For she will never see her youngest son again".
The only one I've seen here in Cyprus was more a large building banner than anything else
It wasn't even religious; it was paid for by some religious society but all it was was a big thank you to our doctors and nurses
If you have a cypriot flag you are leftist
If you have a greek flag you are rightist
If you have both, hello bro
It’s not odd, but people don’t really care about it
We are not like all those other countries that are super proud of their flag eg
The British having their county’s flag on tea cups, or even bath courtines etc
That’s so weird in my opinion
You will most probably only see it in government buildings and schools/ universities
Plus, people also prefer hanging the greek flag on their balconies, which is also quite rare
But, I’ve literally never seen a Cypriot flag on private property lol
I don’t think that’s mostly the case
It’s merely just a matter of identity
If you have both, you are a government building :D
In my life I think I also ever saw 2 or 3 Cypriot flags on private households
Also, on the Ayia Napa highway, there's a house flying the [Apartheid South Africa flag] What's the story there, I wonder
That's how I see it
Must be an ambassador’s house
Also government buildings only have the Cypriot and EU flags
Nah government buuldings no longer have both xD(the have the cypriot and the EU)
If you have both you are a school:)
(I saw two houses in my village having both)
I guess they came back from South Africa (I know a few people that grew up there and returned)
Ok, fair enough
If the ambassador flies the Apartheid flag, their home country did something very wrong when appointing them
Woah, is it not a normal South Africa flag
Whoops, I just saw it, that you were talking about an apartheid flag
I though people were referring to the ambassador’s house, which is also by the highway lol
Exactly
I don’t get why everything has to be left or right, even with flags
Don’t we as people have the right to identity
Frankly, flags are a vital part of it
No, it's a more controversial flag than the Enosis flag, up there with the Confederacy flag in the US
I know what it is . learned about it in history
I probably didn’t read the whole comment
I thought the person above was referring to the ambassador’s house by the Nicosia-Limassol highway
I’m so absent minded lol
Haha my Mum pays €28 for 4 GB (which just got upgraded from 2- for the same price)
[A certain song] was playing on the state radio when it was [taken over by army coupists in 1974] The song is still associated with the coup through cultural ambience, but it's more visceral for those who were actually alive back then
People remark that the lyrics before the interruption were eerily relevant, but you could likely spin any lyrics to make them sound ominous in that context:

Here we say "email"
In Greece it's common to say mail too
No, I haven't heard that fortunately
In Cypriot Greek ίμεϊλ (ímeil) is the most common (is it pronounced ιμέιλ (iméil) in Greece
Thanks
The pronunciation ιμέιλ stands out for me, so that's the one I remembered
Is saying just 'μέιλ' more common in Greece
With some modernity bias:
a. Greece/Eastern Roman Empire,
b. Turkey/Ottoman Empire,
c. The UK/British Empire,
d. Umayyad Caliphate[1],
e. Republic of Venice/Crusader Kingdoms/The Templars[2]
Runner-ups: Egypt, Palestine - a lot of the British Empire's actions in Cyprus were directed by developments in the other side of the southern Cypriot coast
[1]: To a huge extend the reason why Cypriot Greek evolved separately from Medieval (Byzantine) Greek as that period was marked by a prolonged lack of contact with other Greek-speaking populations
[2]: This is a bit too vague, but they kept selling Cyprus back and forth between them during that time so you can't pinpoint it
One historian called the Venetians the most ruthless of all colonisers of Cyprus as they introduced and ran a very intensive feudal system
It also laid the foundations of the Ottoman conquest that it was to follow
Greece/Byzantium, cause we're Greek Cypriot, where I live
Turkey, occupied Greece and Cyprus for 4 centuries, also illegally occupies 37% of the island currently
UK, occupied Cyprus from 1878 till independence in 1960
In order of importance
South Slavic polities probably paid a big role too
At least I remember spending a year in school learning about the Balkan Wars
I think [this] is what you're looking for
Old but gold
It says "Πόσιμπολ" or rather "possible" but in Greek letyers
It's a meme from a gameshow, where the guy was asked who's the main character of Mission imPOSSIBLE
He just said posibol
Greece, obviously
We have the same anthem, the same language, about the same history, more economically tied than the other countries, the only thing separatibg us by now is the political/economic stability and us not being in the Schengen area (and the accent)
You literally can't tell apart Nicosia from Athens (other than the market areas)
Is "TRNC" considered a (real) country by Turks
Well, Turkey is indeed the only country that recognises it
also it has full control over it, so to which extent it should be considered a self declared state and not an annexation is really questionable
Thanks for answering
Some TC politicians say they want to have a relationship with Turkey as equals, a fraternal relationship
Do you think this is possible
(considering that economically, politically and militarily is dependent on Turkey) or do you think that such a relationship can ve established only if the cypriot problem is resolved
(or it can never be established
The Venetians built a ton of other great structures, eg the walls of Negroponte, which WE destroyed
I think [this] is clearly the very best design ever
ένα καράβι!
"It sounds like Spanish" for some odd reason
This is for Greek
For the Cypriot dialect, even Greeks are confused
they don't even know what we are saying most of the time
Reading "buongiorno," I thought of it both in an Italian and a Russian accent
for the past 5 minutes I've been thinking "Lol Lenin in Switzerland" and "Lol Socialist Mussolini"
Depends
if you know, what region was it from
Exactly
I've heard of it before and it sounds like even more turkish gibberish
If our cypriot dialect isn't a reason for reunification, I don't know what is
Yeah
that is exactly why I said it
Yeah makes sense
Athenians sound closer to other Europeans
Also the Ionian archipelago is closer to Italy, I'm not so sure about that
So I guess it sounds closer to Romance there, which I didn't think about before
The further away you go from the capital, the more weird it may sound, and let's not talk about the islands
Crete is closer to Cyprus rather than Greece linguistically
Ye I've noticed that a lot
Well not so much in Limassol or Paphos but certainly in the less touristic areas like Nicosia and Larnaca
Everyone's becoming so goddamn posh there
Compared to our size we try as well:)
But it's nice to see that Greece Italy(and even Turkey) are appreciated by Western Europe for their efforts
My house is downstairs-garage, upstairs-house so downstairs always locked, upstairs only at night (we have a porch/kitchen/side door that has a handle that can open on both sides) plus we live in a village with a population of 200, 150 of are our relatives lol

For me, personally, The song called "Famagusta" by Stelios Xiotis
it's a rather sad song for the city that's, let's just say under the management of anonther country for the tine being, so we don't cause controversy
One of the most beautiful syrian songs I have ever heard
Shit just relazied this is ask europe haha
Well i'm Cypriot as well and my favorite song from cyprus is this  ahhhhthe memories ️️
Yeah, I don't think I can
Do you have any specific questions

So uh
Boy: George or Edward (half the population of males is called George anyway)

Currently it’s [Αθήνα μου]
I remember that in the early 10s this song was very popular in my school: "ai se eu te pego" by Michel Teló. I don't know why though
Oh, I am so sorry, you have the same language so I got confused
Yes
Plateia Eleutherias in Nicosia
Ugly, concrete structure, with jutting out lights (making it easy to trip), peeling benches, random holes (easy for accidents), and not aesthetic, ruining the area, where the Venetian walls stand, covering the walls and making the moat look 1000 times uglier
Also it was extremely expensive
Ancient ruins have been found underneath it during its construction as well, which has forced them to make changes in the way it was to be built, as these “ruins” -basically a bunch of rocks, had to be shown through glass on the ground
Still not furnished- and bound do become even worse and uglier
Also, our roads are terrible, full of bumps and no proper systems for taking down the water when it rains
There are no special parking places for bus and bus stations are literally in the middle of the road, blocking traffic
there’s also a lack of pavement in many areas
On the good side, our municipal theatre now has a roof
Groningen seems a bit panicked
I saw a pharmacy selling antibacterial soap for 15 EUR / 250ml
And that wouldn't be more effective against viruses than standard soap, afaik
>Power points: In Ireland, we have the big, clunky UK 3 pin plug; using the same plugs as mainland Europe would make buying electrical appliances much easier and would offer greater choice to the consumer
>Driving on the same side of the road - In Ireland we drive on the left side of the road, whereas in most European countries (after Brexit, I think the exceptions will only be Ireland and Malta) drivers drive on the right side
It would really open up the import market for cars and campervans from Europe if we also drove on the right side
We have those 2 things as well ( thanks to the British Empire)
Yes
We should give them Emphasis on native languages
The wide teaching of English leads to wearing of the culture
Even though [it lasted only for 8 days] it remains extremely divisive
I can't say for sure that there's a taboo around it, but bringing it up will always cause tension
It's less of "we don't talk about this" and more of "okay then, lets go outside and settle this once and for all". No justice was served then, and people are itching to either punish the coupists, or to defend them from the non-adjudicated allegations
English because almost nothing is available in Greek
It's good to improve my English as well
I'm from a fairly rural area
The biggest stereotypes are: weird accent, vulgar language, rudeness (in most rural areas mostly not in mountains), bitching and having arguments over farms (generally true), bad
very bad drivers, a lot of buses I've heard one time in rural villages like in Famagusta or up in the mountains
That goes for urban areas as well
We're not creative
We just blame others for the things we do

Eerily similar, but vastly more destructive than [our worst explosion] I hope the Cyprus government is doing everything they can to help Lebanon, and not limit themselves to thoughts and prayers

Cyprus (areas under RoC control) in 2011: [Romanian] (it's Russian if you only look at citizens, instead of all residents)
The  name Andreas (Andrew) can be spelled Ανδρέας or Αντρέας, using a τ (Tau)  instead of a δ (Delta)
Ανδρέας should be pronounced /an
ˈðɾɛ.as/ and Αντρέας /an
ˈdɾɛ.as/ (with a /d/ instead of /ð/)
However, in Cyprus both are pronounced with /d/ since /nð/ is harder to pronounce than /nd/ .
It's not possible since the President (both head of the state and head of the government) has to come from the Greek Cypriot Community
It would be controversial if they weren’t born in Greece or Cyprus
I’d say either Greece or Turkey

> How is the political situation in your country
12 parties ran for the House of Representatives (the RoCyprus Parliament), and 8 of them managed to elect MPs
No party has an absolute majority, but the two largest parties have more or less 3/5 of the seats between them
The two dominant parties are always opposed to each other
RoC has a presidential system, so this has no bearing to forming a government
For legislation though, the government has to rely on the support of at least the third largest party, which is not a given on an election year
The fourth largest party and the rest of the MPs are rarely relevant in the legislative process, their votes usually matter if the official opposition is trying to pass a law (but most of the times, even if they manage to pull it off, the President vetoes it or it gets annulled by the equivalent of a Constitutional Court)
> Do you feel you have sufficient choice
Despite having a decent number of parties, and a relatively low electoral threshold (used to be something like 2%, now it's 5%), almost all political formations have a socially conservative (or at least cautiously moderate) and a near-universal nationalist rhetoric
Their fiscal stances are never clear-cut and depend heavily on which of the big two parties offers them a better coalition deal
> Do you think your own values and political convictions are matched well enough by any one of the political parties on the ballot paper
It was always a matter of either voting to prevent the greater evil, or voting to elect the candidate that would most grind the gears of the neonazis
Of course this gets tiring after a while and certainly doesn't make you care about elections as much
Nowadays I place more faith on local grassroots campaigns on very specific issues
>nationalist rhetoric
I wouldn't call anti-Turkey view nationalistic we are in a war with them after all
I don't think most parties have nationalist views like "Cyprus first" or "migrants should leave".
Depending on level of formality in Greek
* δεκτόν (ðektón): *accepted*, formal
* πάσο (páso): [I will let it] *pass*, casual
You can also use έστω (ésto, *so be it*), or εντάξει (endáksi, *OK*)
Officially:
Surname + First name + [of “Father’s First Name”]
Eg a random example would be
Papanikolaou Stelios Konstantinou
This name would unofficially be:

Saint *Basil*, and in Cappadocia (modern-day Turkey)
Yea, I think Greeks are the only ones who have St
Basil (that's literally how we call him)  instead of Santa Claus (St
Nicholas)
Basil is celebrated on the 1st od January
That's when he also brings the gifts to children (not on Christmas day )
Yes, I meant Greeks in general (Greek-Cypriots included)
Greek Cypriot public schools have a confessional religion class, i.e. it's a class that presupposes that you are Greek Orthodox Christian and aims to strengthen your faith and provide you with the Church's philosophical and social stances on a series of issues
It does have a 'survey of world's religions' component later in highschool, always done from an Orthodox POV (Christian "heresies" for example, like Protestantism or "naive and primal beliefs" like Shinto)
The justification by the supporters of this arrangement is that Greek Orthodox Christianity is the majority religion of the country and that since public schools exist to cultivate the students' sense of national identity, teaching the religion is vital
It's always controversial of course
Over the years, parents of students of different religions won some level of exemption from the class, always facing resistance from teachers of course
Some Orthodox Christians also oppose the confessional nature of the course, but they are a minority among their religion
Humanists and leftists who oppose organised religion also protest the existence of a religion course, but without much success
Public school teachers, when seen as an organised societal group, lean conservative hard and any government attempt to reform the educational system towards a non-confessional or non-militant orientation is opposed
I liked that: Teaching religion is illegal in France
I wish more countries had that strong secularism
I have a question though
I've read other comments here  that Catholic countries (Spain, Italy, Austria) signed a treaty with Vatican teaching kids the Catholic faith
That wasn't the case of France
In Cyprus, the student's parents have to officially declare that "our family adheres to a religion different to Orthodox Christianity and therefore we ask for our child to be exempted from Religion class". Irreligiosity is often not accepted as 'a different religion' (it's up to the school principal to accept or deny those applications) and those families are initially denied exemption until they escalate it all the way up to MinEdu
I wouldn't paint Cypriots with a single brush, since for one there is vocal opposition, just not a successful one
That's because the Archbishop of the Orthodox Church of Cyprus (whoever he is at the time) yields a lot of political influence over every elected government
The Minister of Education de facto needs the approval of the Archbishop
For another, there's a fifth of the Cypriot population which is traditionally Sunni Muslim and is committed to secularism and strongly oppose religious education in schools (which nevertheless increasingly happens against their will as Turkey tightens their cultural grip on Cyprus)
There is big portion of Cypriots that are very religious, however their views are much more progressive that those of religious Muslims
But we also have some who are just religious on paper and only celebrate the major holidays with feasts etc
The class itself isn't taken seriously by students with older students (14-18 year olds ) sneakely doing homework for other subjects during the lessons
It's seen as an easy subject were you will get a decent grade without doing absolutely anything
If you get a good teacher then it's fun since you can discuss with them different topics
A big portion of the teachers are those who couldn't become philologists ( Greek/History/Ancient Greek/Latin Teachers ) and not religious fanatics
However this heavily depends on the teacher, there some close minded ones that are misinformed
Priests can also become religious studies teachers but again that isn't necessarily that bad if they are good
Me either
I've just read the comments here
Add Croatia to that list as well
It seems most "Catholic" countries have an agreement with the Vatican to teach their kids the religion
Probably not at all
If they could they would throw us out
Exactly
Good wording
I didn't mean that they would literally throw us out but what you've said it is more accurate
We seem to be a liability that constantly proves difficult to handle (e.g. the recent debate with Cyprus demanding Sanctions on Turkey)
Obligatory: It's not free, it's paid by taxes and/or an insurance mandate (in the case of Cyprus, a specific healthcare tax on each source of your income - all can use the system, only those with income contribute)
I don't even live in Cyprus any more, yet I pay (extremely low) contributions on the interest accrued on my savings
Well, the current problem our system is facing (except for COVID19 having broke it) is the so-called "supermarket mentality", where people show up at their GP with a list of specialist referrals they want and pages upon pages of tests and diagnostics they want to do, without any medical indications
That is exactly the habit they carry over from pre-2019, when we didn't have universal healthcare and everyone was either avoiding the doctor allowing health issues to accumulate (good case scenario) and people with the attitude of since I already paid my insurance contributions I should be able to get everything from the menu (bad case scenario)
That lead to some very strict rate-limiting protocols right now, that are unfortunately needed now but they are not sustainable in the long term
Another problem that was characteristic in the first year of the implementation was getting medicine suppliers on-board
I think it's mostly fixed by now with only seasonal variation in the brand *names* available but during the first 12 months many of us had to still get our medicine from the state pharmacies that used to exist inside state-owned hospitals instead of the NHS-affiliated private pharmacies that is the case now
I know rationality that we should expect a lot of problems with an NHS system that is barely 2 years old
I think that by the time it reaches 10 years of use, any major issues will be ironed out
But it's very easy for political forces that want to privatise healthcare and introduce a non-universal system to attack the NHS now, in its infancy
On the other hand, the waiting lists issue that is usually cited as characteristic of universal healthcare systems, isn't actually that much of a problem in Cyprus
It's limited to certain specialisations only, but we had a shortage of e.g. neurosurgeons even before the NHS
I sometimes called my GP or a specialist under the NHS for a health problem and they told me "can you be here in 15 minutes
" or "can you come tomorrow
" and that was too *early* for me to make it to an appointment
Obviously it wasn't during flu season, doctors have more free time in the summer

Cinq milles cinq cent cinquante cinq
Aka the Chinese number
The 25th, typically with a big family gathering at noon, and parties in the evening
The day *after* Christmas is also a holiday, but not today
As for *the* presents, they are opened on January 1st, name day of Saint Basil
But *other* presents are exchanged through-out the holiday season as families meet each other
It's still [Lent on the 24th] so for practising Greek Orthodoxs it would be very strange to celebrate and have dinners on the 24th
Yes, of course
My point is that it's rare for families to organise any Christmas-related festivities on Christmas Eve, because we don't have a tradition on doing that (and we don't have a tradition of doing that, because when the holiday wasn't as secular as it is now, people weren't allowed to have dinners)
Cultural inertia in other words
It may be changing due to American films though
After all, I even heard of some people giving presents on Christmas instead of New Year
In terms of popularity Ayia Napa is quite famous abroad
It attracts a lot of young people who want to party; especially people from the UK, Russia, Germany and Scandinavia (mostly Swedes though)
It is seen as a wild spot with an amazing nightlife (pre Covid :( now unfortunately everything is empty in Cyprus) It also has the best beaches in Cyprus
They are always categorised in the lists of best beaches worldwide
In terms of the amount of tourists, I think Paphos has  more tourists
It is seen as a calm and chill place
It usually attracts older people and families
It is quite popular with Brits, Russian, Israelis and Germans
In terms of rich People, Limassol is more popular with them
It has expensive restaurants, 5* hotels, it is also a shipping hub and has a lot of amenities
It attracts rich Russians, Arabs and Israelis
Agia Napa
Definitely Agia Napa
It's got a lot of hotels, a lot of beaches and in the future a bigass marina
Either that or Lenessos with skyscrapers+some beaches+a marina
Absolutely
We have achieved so much
I hope to a further integration
Yes
I mean the “country” I am is is not in EU or is recognised (TRNC)  but I am happily a EU citizen (Republic of Cyprus)
Hey
I guess the ordinary person would feel that the only benefit is the ease of travel
But really, the EU is doing so much more
A very strong example that affects people's lives is the Employment protections
We have got them thanks to the EU
The paid leaves, the sick leaves, the protections
Another one is the quality of products we've got
The standards are very high
For contrast, you can see the standards in the US
Another example is how the UK was considered the sick man of Europe in the 70s. After it joined the union, its economy was one of the fastest growing ones in the world
This resulted in people having a better quality of life
The same goes for all the countries of the former communism bloc
Their income quadrapled since joining the union
It's safe, so long as the house pipes are well maintained
But most people buy bottled water anyway
A bit of prejudice against it, and a lot of "it comes out too hot to be pleasant to drink" for most of the year
But I would say only weirdos will not use tap water for anything that requires boiling (making coffee, cooking)
We mostly use those "office" water coolers at home
Public transport is non-existant and people just don't want to stop using their cars
Lack of public transport (apart from busses)- Nicosia
Nicosia Cyprus capital has the ugliest sky line in Europe
Seriously Google Nicosia Cyprus and you won't be able to even find a single photo of an interesting land mark
Unfortunately this is the result of years of neglect because most of the development money goes to coastal areas which are visited by tourists leaving the capital which has no beach to die
Well
ppl love the convinience of their car
I use buses to go to Nicosia
75+% of the people
in the buses are non-Cypriots
Maybe if the bus network was better people would start using them more
Yeah
but again public transport is even connected with social status(especially for people that work)
Many students will get their license on the day they become 18(they book a test on their bday
I mentioned it another thread here, but basically that there wouldn't be massive cultural differences because I was atypical for Cyprus, and because I had many multicultural experiences before and I was western-educated
Living in an individualist society like Finland still feels strange to me
How would you describe the Netherlands on this aspect by the way
I will be going to Groningen for an exchange semester soon, it will be nice to know what to expect
The moment I realised was when I was returning to Finland after my winter break, and my taxi driver didn't utter a single word while driving
After a 20 hour journey to get back to Finland on New Year's Eve, I was honestly in need of some conversation and my taxi driver wasn't offering it
But to make it more general, it's things like people standing a meter away from you in queues as if you smell bad or something, or when you mention some difficulty you are facing they just acknowledge your problem but make no offers to help because you are not family or a close friend
Cyprus goes to the other extreme
Case in point, a few years ago when I still lived in Cyprus and I was waiting for the bus, I started talking with an old man I just met and by the end of than conversation he was offering me a job I didn't even need since I was already employed
Some people here say that for Greece
> Did you try to start a conversation with the taxi driver
Yeah, I tried to do some small talk but the driver wasn't following me up with questions, so after a while I stopped bothering him
>  Just remember that Finns don't act like that because they don't like you or are selfish, it's because they respect your privacy and personal space :)
Yeah, I didn't doubt this at all
Finns have been the most polite and tolerant people I've met
And Cypriots can be *too much* in your business, it's a double edged sword
I wish we could average the social mores of Cyprus and Finland, and live somewhere in the middle :D
> If I have a bad day, having a nice chat with a barista or taxi driver can be massive in lifting up my mood
Twice in Cyprus, I had baristas remember me and ask how I have been work-wise for more than two years after I last visited/they last worked at the café we met :D
I readily admit that we swing too much in the other direction
Yeah, there's the language aspect too
My Finnish is not up to a level to hold a full conversation yet, so I spoke in English
Like most Finns I've met in the last half a year, the taxi driver spoke very good English, but he wouldn't follow me on on my small talk
I mean, to be fair to the guy, his job is to drive a taxi, not be my conversation partner
I mention that anecdote because it was the moment I realised that I truly moved in a different culture now and my assumptions aren't compatible any more
&#x200B;
Edit: But even the language aspect is a difference, I've travelled in ex-Yugoslavia quite a bit, and the drivers often spoke very little English, but were all very eager to talk to me and either inquire about my culture or explain theirs
I would never call that bad behaviour or bad customer service, I want to be clear about that
Well, since you brought up monopoly, my taxi-related complaint would be that they are so unimaginably expensive
I guess this relates to what you mention, I read something about all price limits for taxis being lifted and every company can charge what they want
Are Welsh taught in Cardiff as a mandatory class at school
I have some cousins that were born there and I am wondering of they can speak Welsh at all
Wow that was fast
They are like 25-30
Did they teach Welsh back then
(I was really surprised to learn that Welsh is more used than Irish)
Okay thanks
I think it's the feeling that we belong in a bigger family, although being different
Especially for those countries that are also part of the EU
I grew up in the EU and I just have this feeling of togetherness
It helps that now it is easier than ever to travel and to connect with other Europeans through a lot of amazing initiatives (Erasmus, volunteering etc)
It's not a popular idea
Most people like the EU the way it is
But there's a few who want further integration with the Ultimate goal being that of the United States of Europe
There is also this political party
The only Pan-european party
United we stand ️
Was the Euroscepticism prevalent before the eurocrisris and Brexit and coronavirus
Or do you think that In the last decade with a series of unfortunate events(e.g. the global financial crisis and the subsequent eurocrisris)  this has led to the increase of Euroscepticism in Italy
Exactly
Most people can't agree on the reforms
But what I meant is that some People wouldn't want further integration, thus preferring the EU as it is
On a national level, there are two groups of countries those who prefer further integration and those who don't.
Yes there is Volt as well
Well I said the Federalists were the only one because as far as I know (their info on their website) they are a political party whereas Volt (again info on their website) is a political movement although they have a MEP
That's interesting
I thought that Italy being a founder of the then community, it would have been a supporter
Why do u think Euroscepticism was always there
That's so true
I agree with your points
Sadly that's what has led Britain to vote out of the EU
Basically politicians use the EU as a scapegoat to justify their failings
I also get what you mean
Italy didn't benefit the way Germany did but surely it helped
I was just surprised because I thought Euroscepticism growing in Italy was a recent event
I didn't know that it has always been there
I say "I am thirsty" (because I want her to bring me a glass of water
"Pee and drink"
If I am angry "Headbutt the wall"
If you don't like what she says "Drink vinegar"
When she is doing housework and you ask her what are you doing, "I kick the dogs out of the village"
"Wear more clothes"
"I don't feel cold"
"You are but you dont know it"
Turn off the heater, sun burns stones (oops, this is something grandfather says)
Haha yeah
My mother a week ago:

Greek has a very historical spelling of words
This leads to the same sound being written with different ways depending on etymology  and grammar .
For example:
The sound /i/ can be written with 6 different ways
/e/ with 2
/o/ with 2
/g/ with 2
/af/, /av/, /ev/, /ef/ also with 2
some times /ks/ is written as κσ  (ks) and not ξ (x) .
There also times where a constant is written 2 times but its pronunciation is the same in standard greek  for example t and tt make the same sound
In Cypriot Greek however double constants have a distinct pronunciation but we tend to pronounce single consonants as double constants some times so it doesn't really help as that much with spelling
Reading Greek however is pretty straight forward as letters and letter combinations have only one sound each . Stress is also always indicated with an accent . The only part that's not as predictable is when the /i/ sound is pronounced as /j/ when it is followed by another vowel but that's something that only foreign speakers may struggle with .
Yeh almost always in Turkish as well
In Cypriot Greek, the following feel natural to me but afaik the younger generation has imported a lot more terms in the language:
Re (compare and contrast with Turkish *be*, Balkan *bre*)
ye mu ('my son' literally, but can be used even towards people of roughly equal age, and it has some discourse/pragmatic nuances we can generalise as being 'reproachful')
kori mu ('my daughter' literally, as above)
I have so many alternative answers:
The need to get rid of them is low in mostly cashless societies
Policy inertia
Germans love them
Any store that rounds to the nearest 5 cent has my loyalty
(Hell, with inflation as it is, soon I wouldn't even mind rounding to the nearest 10 cent)
Judging from the responses of other Germans (and also Austrians) in this and other similar threads, I'm not as optimistic as you
Even though so many countries did it already, you always get those comments claiming they are certain merchants will always round up and never down
Well, I definitely welcome those news
>  it should be illegal to say so but then keep more of your money
The times you lose 2~3 cents on a receipt are offset by the times you win 2~3 cents thanks to rounding, so at the end of the year you are either short by few cents or over by few cents
I will gladly lose few cents *every time* if it means I don't have to carry useless copper coins that even the cashier who gave them to me as change doesn't want me to use them to pay them
What happens with those coins any way is that I either leave them on the change tray, or throw them in the bin
Sure, I would be in favour of them doing that, but also if you stop paying their X.99 items, I guess they will feel less of the need to use them
And others already mentioned fractional cents
There's already no 1/2 (or 1/10) Euro cent coin and we still accept that we lose a few cents over time when we buy products by weight or volume
I conceptualise the rounding differently
I feel that pay a few cents as a 'service fee' each time I buy something with cash so that those coins stay out of my wallet
It doesn't feel like a lie, but as a convenience
Here, it's either you be a boy scout or go football training
wither way you'd still find yourself somewhere up on a mountain not knowing wtf you're doing
In Cyprus, not really because they either do post-office branch pickup, or signed delivery
Recently they began installing packet stations too, I think 11 are operational but they require a subscription
In Germany, well from my experience alone, also no
It's either in-person delivery (but no signature) or handed to a neighbour with a notice identifying them left in your own postbox, or if none is possible, pickup from a Paketstation
What is sometimes a problem though is in some student housing complexes, where the "neighbour" is the property manager, and they leave packets in an area without access control or attendance so that everyone can pick up their items at any item (but also potentially other people's items)
Another thing is that if the courier is DHL or Deutsche Post, packages are delivered to `/dev/null`. But that's DHL, not porch pirates
I also briefly experienced it in the Netherlands (signed delivery) and Finland (pickup from branch)
It's a simple sentence, and Greek and English are not exactly strangers
I expect it to be easy to understand
Γεια, λαλούν με Γιάννον, εχάρηκα που σε γνώρισα. Πόθθεν είσαι;
Hi, they-call me John, I-was happy to you have-met
Whence are-you
Wouldn’t John be Giovanni and Johnny Gianni
Γειά, με λένε Ιωάννη, είναι χαρά μου που σε γνωρίζω. Από που είσαι;
Hi, me say-they John, is happiness my that you meet-I. From where are-you
Ps there are many ways to say this sentence
and in Greek it really doesn’t matter where you put the subject, verb, or object, so there are even more ways of saying this
This translation would be different depending on whether you used the word “to say”, “to call”, or “my name is”.
Also it would be different if you spoke to someone bigger in age to you, or not a friend/ person you know/ is close to you
This could’ve been said in the plural form of politeness
Wow
Interesting
This proves how simple English is
I’ve heard Turkish is a difficult language to learn
Το «λαλούν με» εν θα εγίνετουν «they say me»; Αφού η αυτούσια σημασία της λέξεως λαλώ (στα κυπριακά) μεταφράζεται στα εγγλέζικα ως to say
Verbs in Greek (and other languages), sometimes have different meanings depending on the syntactic frame they are in, so λαλώ *κάποιον κάτι* (call someone something) is different than λαλώ *κάποιου κάτι* (say to-someone something) and λαλώ *κάτι* (say something)
I will give a more transparent example:
μαθθαίννω ισπανικά: I learn Spanish
μαθθαίννω τον Χάρη: I learn (about) Harry
μαθθαίννω του Χάρη: I teach Harry
μαθθαίννω του Χάρη ισπανικά / ισπανικά του Χάρη: I teach Harry Spanish / I teach Spanish to Harry
For the technical terminology here, this is about indirect objects (έμμεσα αντικείμενα) in different cases (πτώσεις)
In Greek instead of you’ve broken my balls, you can say you’ve broken my liver
Yes, but the verb by it’s self, Λαλώ would be to say
And since this is a word to word translation, you wouldn’t consider it on a technical aspect
Well, whether the verb λαλώ, or any verb in any language, has a meaning before it is placed in a sentence, is actually quite controversial in Linguistics for all sorts of theoretical and empirical reasons
It's not as simple as it looks (as linguists, we don't even have a good definition about what even is a word, but for sure it's not 'a series of letters with spaces around it')
I don't want to go technical here since the point of this thread is to have some fun seeing how different word order can be in different languages
Between institutionalised bullying and loss of career opportunities and time-restricted scholarships, hardly anything to reminisce about while serving in the Greek Cypriot National Guard
And then there is Cyprus that the President is both the Head of the Government and Head of the State
The "bird" of Cyprus

Disgusting traditional Cypriot dishes:
Καράολοι (Karaoloi- snails which are surprisingly nice)
Πόθκια όρνιθας (Pothkia Ornithas- chicken feet)
Πατσάς (Patsas- a soup made of head and stomach of the sheep)
Ζαλατίνα, (Zalatina- a gel meat broth which includes the pig’s head, ears, tongue, eyes and jaws as well as some lemon juice) => my dad loves this (wtf)
Σεφταλλιά (sheftallia- that is DELICIOUS
It is a type of crépinette, a sausage without skin, that uses caul fat, or omentum, the membrane that surrounds the stomach of pig or lamb, to wrap the ingredients rather than sausage casing
Συκώτι (sikoti- liver of Any animal, pig, sheep, beef, chicken, duck)
Αμπελοπούλλια (ampelopoullia- birds that only exist in Cyprus and its illegal to eat them, though its said that they are delicious)
Μαγειρίτσα (Mageiritsa- a soup made in Easter with the entrails of sheep and rise)
Λαγοί (Lagoi- Rabbits)
Κοκορέτσι (Kokoretsi- eaten during Easter consisting of lamb or goat intestines wrapped around seasoned offal, including sweetbreads, hearts, lungs, or kidneys)
Χωρκάτικο Λουκάνικο (chorkatiko Loukaniko- Cypriot sausage witch is made of wine and coriander and every part of the animal)
I LOVE octopus wym
>entáxei
In Cyprus we say "nta" as a shortening of "entáxei" but OK is also widely used
It was first created , and then it was split  , you'll never guess by whom , now they are trying to stitch it back together .
It’s been fucked up by other countries
Limassol looks more modern compared to other places in Cyprus
It has modern architecture and skyscrapers
Also the Limassol Marina, the old port and Molos (promenade) were all constructed/renovated less than 10 years ago
I'm not doing the regex again, from the top of my mind it's a tie between Orá (Ορά) and Sha (Σια)
We just honk whenever
Are you bored
Honk
Did someone cut you off
Honk
You saw someone you know

The Republic of Cyprus government cannot collapse because of the presidential system
The only way it has happened was by war (in 1963 and 1974)
Regardless, due to the Citizenship by Investment scandal in 2020, the current government was the first since 1963 not to have been able to pass the budget bill yet
Under a different system, it would have collapsed in December
The only restriction I can find in the law is that one may not have more than 3 given names and 2 family names (141(I)/2002 Art
43)
Anything else is probably down to cultural norms, and cultural norms around naming are extremely strong in Cyprus and that's why can only choose between six names: Andreas, Andros, Andrikos, Andri, Androulla, and Andriani
> You can't use the name of a living parent or sibling, use a lastname as a first name
Wow, you guys just prohibited 90% of the Greek Cypriot naming practices :P
Also I want to add, that in Cyprus if you want your child baptised in the Orthodox church then there has to be an saint whose name that coincides
This isn't an actual law of course, but more of a religious stipulation
Some priests are anal about it
Some aren't and can twist the rules a bit (like they did with my 'Western' name when I was baptised)
I know recent cases where the parents couldn't go with the name they wanted because of it
Though the cultural naming is still strong with the boys, I'm happy to see that the girl names are becoming more and more varied these days
> I work with the programs used for the name registry
Interesting
Are there technical limitations, like string length
> In that case the ID or passport would write "Gouilliam or William" (same for last names)
I hate that ELOT standard
We follow it in Cyprus too, but I got my first ID card soon after it was introduced to I managed to get a romanisation that was half-way towards the romanisation I wonted
The ELOT one would be unpronounceable
From the leaked citizenship-by-investment passports though, [naturalised citizens get to keep their romanised spellings without the OR thing you describe]
> Apart from that, we discourage Greek born parents from the non official variants of the names
A person called Giannis is always registered as Ioannis, Vasilis as Vasileios, Thanasis as Athanasios etc
How come
This is one of the main differences in our naming conventions
We register Μιχάλης, Γιώργος, Θανάσης, etc if that's what the parents wanted
Governments of foreign countries don't get to change your name, they have an international duty to accept other countries' travel documents
They may start applying conditions on you once you try to naturalise and become a citizen though
Usually during naturalisation the restrictions will be more relaxed than the restrictions they apply on citizens from birth
In Cyprus, you will just be given an official Greek-script spelling for whatever name you have (a Turkish-script spelling is a theoretical possibility, but that would have consequences that are a story for another time)
In 2011, there were at least 26 Ναπολέων living in Cyprus, but Ναβουχοδονόσορ must be one colourful character
> This isn't an actual law of course, but more of a religious stipulation
Indeed, and it's important to emphasise because in some other Orthodox-majority countries it's different: in Cyprus, baptism has no legal effect
The name you register with the government is the one that counts
One of my brothers was baptised with a totally different name (not even related) than the one he officially has
He (and we) only uses his official name
But of course, culturally there's extreme pressure in getting baptised
If you don't want a Church-approved name though, just register the name you want in the civil registry
> Paris
I wonder if the courts would accept a child named [Paris after the mythological prince] It's a relative common name for Greek speakers
> I don't think Cyprus uses ELOT , I am only seeing Panayiotis with y.
We were more lax about it in the beginning, but we have adopted it in the last decade
In the past, the procedure was that there's a default romanisation scheme, but we could choose to diverge from it as an individual right ([page 2, point 6] [That's not the case any more] (page 3, point 5)
My spelling with 'y' got grandfathered, but if I have children, they will probably not have the choice
I would be okay with automatic romanisation if it was a system other than ELOT, but if it has to be ELOT then I believe people should have the right to diverge from it
> Everybody in Greece is really familiar with Γεώργιος, Αθανάσιος, Μιχαήλ etc
When someone calls and says his name is Θάνος I always search for Αθανάσιος. I think our system is better as there is a standard
If you're official name is Αθανάσιος, you can be called Θάνος, Θανάσης etc while if you are eg registered as Θάνος, you're always a Θάνος.
I dunno, I can understand having a small number of limitations on names, like reasonable length and nothing that is obviously harmful to the child, but I can't justify giving the government the right to decide which variant of my name I should have on my papers
If there's no reason to restrict something, it shouldn't be restricted
Name changes aren't particularly difficult in Cyprus in any case, if a Τάσος from birth decides they want to be officially known as Αναστάσης or Αναστάσιος in adulthood, they can just change it at the Civil Registry
Is there a way to officially record stress in written German for purposes like that, or do you just hope the civil servant is understanding
It absolutely depends on the situation and what's my role there
If it's an emergency or an important yet complicated discussion, and we have other shared languages we both speak better than you speak Greek, let's use them
If I am working service and I have a queue forming up behind you, please just use English
Otherwise, yeah go ahead
When I was studying in Finland, the student tasked with introducing me to how things work around there warned me precisely not to greet people in Finish at the start of a transaction if I intend to speak English to them and that I should save my greetings for the end of the transaction
What really stayed with me is how polite Finns were, even though I never managed to connect with them culturally
And at least the people I encountered were quite chatty too, which was a welcome surprise so far up north
That's opposed to lets say, the Netherlands, were I also lived, which was both a case of no cultural overlap and I felt like I was personally attacked every other interaction (Dutch/German directness)
> Around 18:00 is pretty standard here at least
But I only have just finished tea by that time, I'm not yet hungry for dinner
I can’t think of one actually (apart from - the)
ή means or
Ooops I skipped the last line xd
I will say both are popular
Green olives are often eaten as olives
Black olives are often used to make olive-pie(pita)
You guys are full of Italian tourists
I was so surprised when I visited Malta last year
There were loud Italians (no offense) literally everywhere
I’ve seen a brochure about boat trips to Sicily in my hotel lobby
So if you are a Tunisian who knows Italian, you can easily learn Maltese
Got it
It's heavily discouraged, and if someone decides to report it, the parents get in legal trouble (it happens occasionally, mostly affecting single-mothers with immigrant background)
I have looked for statistics on this and similar issues in the past, but the open data only uses extremely broad crime categories so no such analysis is possible
This is rather the impression I have from following the news very closely for the last 15 years
Single immigrant women have the least access to support networks since they have no stay-at-home partner to take care of the children, walk them/drive them to school and other activities and chaperone them when they play at parks
They also don't have many or any family in Cyprus to help with child-rearing in the place of a partner other than slightly older siblings taking care of their younger ones
The above means that they are in a position where they have to let their children walk alone to school, afternoon activities, or playground and/or stay at home alone after school more often than married women and/or women whose extended family lives in Cyprus do
And then, someone has to report it to the police
Greek Cypriots living in the same town are actually quite likely to know each other, so when they see a Greek Cypriot child roaming outside alone they already know where to find the parent, and police doesn't get involved
More recent immigrants don't have that level of social interconnectedness, so a worried witness who sees a young child outside without a parent can't think of anywhere else to turn but the police
Finally, Cyprus Police is more likely to let Greek Cypriot parents (compared to non-Greek Cypriots) get away with warnings instead of starting criminal investigations each time there's a report against them
That's again something that makes it in the news distressingly often - the last few years have been marked by domestic abuse cases, family murders, suicides, and murder-suicides in Greek Cypriot families that were attributed to parental abuse that was made known to the authorities but no action was taken
"Abandonment of a child under the age of 16" is the crime in question, and leaving a child at home for a few hours technically counts as that
It's up to the legal system to decide if the case is worth pursuing, if the police decides to charge them
Why would the parent have to drive the child or why would it have to walk
You don’t have busses
Having lived in all sorts of places in western/northern Europe, I have now gotten used to seeing children roam about freely, but the first few months were bizarre
I am still not over how a 12 year old who only hit puberty the week before was doing Loss Prevention checks on me in Albert Heijn though
I am pretty much on the same side as you about nurturing children's independence and resilience
I see merits in our collectivist culture on other aspects, but our child rearing practices are not part of it
It fails both men (who are never taught how to live alone, and instead are hand-delivered from their mother to their wife), and obviously the women who are tasked to take care of them as a 'self-evident responsibility' to the expense of their own freedom
There's no "legal hypocrisy" though, because the span between 15 and 17 is when young people gradually start receiving legal rights and responsibilities
E.g. you can't work if you are not at least 15, and before 16 it's restricted to a couple of days per week
At 16 a few days more, and I think only by 17 you can work full-time in Cyprus
School buses only exist in the big cities[1]
In towns (κωμόπολη to be exact) and villages, that's not done - or at least it wasn't done when I was a child
For the first few grades of primary school, my grandma would walk me there
Later, my mum got a car so she'd drive me
When I started secondary education, that was in the next village so there was a bus, but my mum would drive me to the bus stop because it was 10 minutes away from our house on foot
[1] It is actually humanly impossible to rely on public transport outside of Nicosia and Limassol
In Famagusta, the only lines that exist are to get old people to hospitals, labourers to factories, and ferry tourists between Protaras and Ayia Napa
Oh damn idk what village you’re from but in Vyzakia,potami,astromeriti,Evrychou,kakopetria,akaki etc there was a bus (after 2009 when Dhmotiko asinou was built)
In vyzakia, a bus picked us all up from our homes  while in nikitari and potami there was a bus stop every other house or 3
Now that the bus stop is 10 minutes away from my house for lykeio the bus that picks the students from the villages 20minutes away picks us up again then a different bus  takes us to evrychou but before when 2009 when villages has bigger population and their own schools the kids walked
OSEA only has 3 stops inside my entire village, and approximately 4 buses per day
There's no dedicated school bus for the primary schools inside the village - only that bus that would take us to the next village for middle school and high school
Yikes that’s a shame for such a tiny country our public transport system sucks so much
Yeah, the main problem is how they design the routes
They make no god-damn sense
Even Nicosia, which has the most robust bus network, has routes that are designed to force everyone to go through the Solomou Square Central Station in the city centre, even if they want to move laterally in the city
When I was working in Nicosia, I lived 15 minutes away from my job by bike
I would normally cycle there, but when it rained I would order a taxi
Taking the bus would mean travel in the opposite direction for 15 minutes, change bus at Solomou Sq
(god knows how much wait time) and travel for 25 more minutes in my proper direction
Secondarily, the geoinformation system sucks
The apps and websites are impossible to use, the data in the API (that is accidentally left open even though it's not public) is still not real time, there's no proper route planning, and they didn't even do the bare minimum and partner with Google Maps
Non-Greek speakers who come to Cyprus for their Erasmus baffle me, since with a few exceptions, instruction is in Greek
Then I realise there's a reason they always come for the spring semester and never the fall one
> not much going on
I dunno, a spend many a great nights in the town's only affordable restaurant, the Burger King in Iso myy xD
>a lot of English speaking courses
See, I kept finding it weird that people keep replying to me saying that, but I realised that maybe a lot of incoming Erasmus students go to our private universities
They probably have more English programmes than the public universities, but they are also irrelevant since they are different levels of diploma mills
Who can learn a foreign language in a few weeks before departing for the exchange at a sufficient level to follow academic topics though
I didn't go to an Erasmus exchange myself so I wouldn't waste teaching time, but if I would, it would be somewhere they teach in a language I already know
My alma mater states the following
> The language of teaching at the University is Greek
Most departments offer some courses in English
Other Departments may offer bibliography, assignments, tutorials and exams in English
Incoming students are advised to attend free of charge the Greek intensive courses offered during the year at the School of Modern Greek of the University
It's accurate, but it's up to the students to decide if they want to just scrape the bottom of the barrel for the one or two courses per year in English in the Department of e.g. Physics, or just spend their time doing Independent Study with a supervisor and not attend any lectures
Well, if that's what students want, there's nothing wrong with it
It would be, if the teaching is in a language I don't know at a good level
Yeah, you are probably right
I never looked into what other universities require because I never planned on going on an Erasmus exchange
My answer would be an “eh”. I don’t really desire unification of Cyprus
I’m fine as we are, and honestly don’t want things to become more complicated than they already are
If unification were to happen, how is it going to happen
It seems to me that federation “omospondia” as they call it, is the most popular “solution”. But the island would still be somewhat divided in that sense
Also what would happen to the Turkish Settlers
How will everything work
It seems complicated, and even if all Cypriots wanted this, I still think we wouldn’t be able to achieve it, especially if our old pal Turkey isn’t fond of it
Officially all Greek Cypriot parties want reunification and officially the 2 biggest parties want the same kind of solution, a "bi-zonal, bi-communal federation (BBF)" as proposed by the UN
This means that the Republic of Cyprus will be have a Turkish Cypriot side and a Greek Cypriot side where there will be some local autonomy when it comes to administration
Internationally however, the Republic of Cyprus will be one entity with one foreign policy
That's already a big concession for Greek Cypriots, even though that's what the major parties are advocating for in negotiations that's not the ideal solution for most Greek Cypriots
Prior to the invasion there wasn't a "North" and a "South" side, Greek and Turkish Cypriots lived in all areas of the island sometimes in separate villages , sometimes in mixed villages and sometimes in towns/cities (which were really small back then as most of the population was in rural areas) . When the invasion happen a forced population exchange led to many people losing their homes and their ancestors' land
So in a way splitting Cyprus in 2 sperate zones justifies the outcome of the invasion
That's why a unitary state solutions is preferred by most Greek Cypriots over a BFF
However Turkish Cypriots (/Turkey since in reality they are the ones who have the final say in this and not TCs) won't even negotiate for a Unitary State ,  Turkish nationalists want full-on partition of the island into 2 sperate states so BFF is what GC politicians are advocating for
So, the major political powers of GC already made the consession of negotiating for a BFF solution that's just the start of the problems
Greek Cypriots want properties taken by the Turkish army  (homes, land, shops ) to be given back to their rightful owners or for the owners to be compensated fairly
That's hard when a lot of them where given not to displaced TC from the south but to Turkish army soldiers or to illegal settlers from Turkey who are actively encouraged to come to Cyprus so that Turkey alters the area's demographics . Greek Cypriot want The illegal settlers to leave the island but that's also difficult to happen since now more than 40% of the population of the occupied areas is non-Cypriot
There are now more TC living outside of Cyprus than in Cyprus
Another major problem is the presence of Turkish troops on the island , GC want them to leave since we want an independent country
Turkey however wants to maintain presence on the island as it's location is a geopolitical advantage and TC might feel more secure .
The Cyprus problem for GC is a problem of an invasion and continued occupation of the island by Turkey, it's not an inter-communal problem and the solution to that problem is the liberation of the occupied areas
The term reunification can be misleading as it implies that the GC and TC were separated by their own which is not true .
Hello fans
I will talk you about both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, the Annan plan, the Gutteres Framework, the last negotiations in Crans Montana and much more
Greek Cypriots want reunification
But they won't accept any solution plan
All Greek Cypriot parties support reunification
A two state solution is considered treason
About the people
There are some that don't want two states
There are some who strongly support reunification
There are many that want reunification but don't want the proposed solution because according to them it's unfair
What is the proposed solution
Bi-communal Bi-zonal Federation
What is that
Keep reading
Generally speaking GCs want reunification but they have some red lines
I will explain to you what these are
"If you say they want reunification, why did GCs said NO to the Annan plan
To be continued

Since you all waited for so long last night I mention you so you can see my answers
If you have any questions let me know
If this is too long again let me know
I have been waiting for a question like this lol
I am a greek speaking cypriot
The GC side from experience is the one least willing for reunification
The in my opinion false ideology that the Turks"walked in our houses and killed everyone and took half our country" is one very common between GC and I believe it is because that is what we were taught
Only part of the story
For decades the church has been controlling cyprus , influencing it greatly
this involved education
All though that seems to be in a smaller scale nowadays, it's still there
The TC community seems much more willing for reunification
The people remember a time when they used to live together with GC
Most of the Turkish cypriots if not all used to speak fluent greek
so long story short, GC citizens overall do not support reunification of the island, whereas TC citizens want reunification
Cyprus has a very long and delicate history so I am unable to explain it all over a comment
It's a very beautiful and interesting history that is sadly hidden even from its people
i urge you to explore it
But regarding the question, it's all so messed up right now
Too many mixed opinions and beliefs
I'm speaking about what I think the vague image looks like
*Disclaimer:*
* *left Cyprus 7 years ago, I spend around 2 months each year in Cyprus and have daily communication with family*
* *left-leaning, pro-unification*
* *Greek-speaking Cypriot (GSC)*
* *Age: late 20's*
Not just met, but I have friends that are Turkish-speaking Cypriots (TSC)
The things we have in common are way more than food and words and personal aspirations
The mentality is very similar
The Cypriot problem is a simple one to understand, yet very complicated to solve
Having said that, we must realise that it is not a social issue, it's a political one
Let's dive in a little deeper and let me paint you an image of the *reality*:
**Republic of Cyprus:**
* Internationally recognised
* Part of the European Union
* *normal* country
**TRNC:**
* Not recognised, besides Turkey
* Dependent on Turkey (in all aspects)
The division of the island was done in 1974, that's 46 years ago
Both after-war populations grew up in a nationalistic (under the facade of *patriotism*) educational system and with virtually no contact with each other
Also, the younger population (16-30) is very apolitical
The "borders" opened in 2003, so there is a new generation growing up with this normality
This generation can visit the other side anytime they want as "tourists" for a day
Here, I must mention that according to the Cypriot Constitution of 1959, all Cypriots are citizens of the Republic of Cyprus (RoC) and as such can freely move, work and vote
In reality, however, TSCs are full citizens of RoC but GSC not of "TRNC". While in theory, the TSCs could move to the more developed South (very few TSCs live in the South) the social implications are such that they make that a rather difficult reality
* The TSCs have more to gain from a unification but they are already the minority in the North and the influence of Turkey is so strong that basically there is no will
Since the opening of the "borders", TSCs have applied and gotten Cypriot passport and as such are EU citizens
And subsequently, this has diminished the "need" for international recognition
In the North, there are hundreds of thousands of Turks that were brought to Cyprus after the war and of course many who were born here
Their connection with the land is less emotional
* The GSCs are fine as it is
Yes, they'd love to get back their properties (I doubt any of them would move back in) but it's more of a romantic dream
The financial benefits of unification are huge (in the long term)
The market will almost double, access to Turkey's immense market (both for imports and exports) and it paves the way for the peaceful exploration of hydrocarbons found in Cyprus
There are politicians on both sides (especially on the right) that have built their whole career on the issue, solving it leaves them basically without a cause
**TL;DR** Unification is worth it, but very unlikely (for the moment)
Well, it is an occupation
I will send you some TCs friends
Are GCs in favour of reunification
I answered last night about that
Generally speaking GCs are in favour of reunification and they are against parition
Unitary state is the most popular model for GCs but the GC side accepted the turkish thesis of federation as a compromise so we can achieve reunification and liberation
The acceptance of Bi-Communal Bi-Zonal Federation is considered a painful compromise in order to achieve a solution
The two biggest parties(rightist & leftist) agree with BBF
The centrist parties accept federation but are not willing to "give" as many things as the other two parties
The socialist-democratic party disagrees with BBF because it's racist
The nationalistic party is against any form of federation and openly supports the unitary state
Most GCs don't know or understand BBF
They want reunification but they won't accept any solution plan
&#x200B;
Are TCs against reunification
I don't think so
The majority of TCs would vote in favour of both reunification and permanent division
Unlike GCs parties that are all against a two state solution, the rightist TC parties no longer support the UN agreed model of solution and support either a two state solution or a confederation of two states
The leftist parties still support reunification
&#x200B;
The current leader of the Turkish Cypriot Community, Mr Mustafa Akinci, supports reunification as a Bi-Communal Bi-zonal Federation with political equality as described in the relevant UN resolutions
In a few months a voting will be held and the new leader of the Turkish Cypriot Community will be chosen
The main canditates are Akinci(pro-reunification), Tatar(against reunification, supports two state solution), Erhurman(pro-reunification), Ozersay (pro-confederation/two-states)
Btw I'm talking about the people not the parties  ^^
We agree:)
Oh I don’t mind
This is from my point of view
I’m Greek Cypriot, though I don’t think that’s how most Greek Cypriots view the situation
Many want unification, which I view as somewhat “romantics”. It seems that many are sceptical and really neutral/don’t know what to think about it
It’s something strange, and especially since we have been divided enough, I think many people are just “ok” with the current situation
Edit:
Ps I’m 16, so bare in mind like most of my age, I have never met a Turkish Cypriot and never lived on a Cyprus that’s “one”.
What about erdogan refusing the withdrawal of Turkish troops
Also recent drillings on our EEZ ain’t doing any good
We will get to an analysis on the Annan plan tomorrow morning
**Bi-communal Bi-zonal Federation**
&#x200B;
It was agreed in 1977 that the solution to the cypriot problem would be achieved bi negotiations under the umbrella of the United Nations and United Cyprus would be a Bi-Communal Bi-zonal Federation
From now on we call it BBF
&#x200B;
So what BBF
&#x200B;
There is no such a thing as BBF in the world
The closer examples we have is Bosnia-Herzegovina and Belgium
&#x200B;
But again what does it mean
&#x200B;
**Bi-communality**
It means that the state will have two communities
The Republic of Cyprus is a Bi-Communal State
Bi-communality has some characteristics
Separate elections
GCs vote for GCs, TCs vote for TCs, two official languages
Parliament is divided based on the community
(the ratio is 30% TCs even though the population was 18%)
One GC president, one TC vicepresident
Pretty much everything is divided in two
&#x200B;
**Bi-zonality**
This used to have a different (even worse) meaning but now it basically means that United Cyprus will have two zones
One governed by Turkish Cypriots and one governed by Greek Cypriots
These two will be the states/provinces/cantons(call them what you want) of the federation and these two will be equals
&#x200B;
**Federation**
It will be a federation
The federation will have two Parliaments
A president and a vice-president
A central government
A Council of Ministers appointed by the presidents
&#x200B;
I will get a bit deeper on things that are and aren't agreed
Have in mind that in all negotiations are based on the principle that "nothing is agreed until
everything is agreed".
&#x200B;
So the two communities agree that United Cyprus will be a Bi-Communal Bi-zonal Federation with political equality as described in the UN resolutions
United Cyprus shall have a single international legal personality and a single sovereignty, a single citizenship
&#x200B;
The President of the Republic of Cyprus is the negotiator of the Greek Cypriot Community
International Community recognise the leader of the Turkish Cypriot Community as the negotiator and representative of the Turkish Cypriot community in the international community
"TRNC officials" are not considered representatives of the TC community
&#x200B;
In 2017, in Crans Montana there was an International Conference for the Cypriot problem
The two communities and the three guarantor powers of the Republic of Cyprus participated
(we are not sure if the Republic of Cyprus was also a participant)
&#x200B;
The talks failed but I am not gonna get into what happened and why
I will instead focus on the most important part
What are the agreements and the disagreements
In order to do do that I will present the Gutteres Framework
**The Gutteres Framework includes the six main aspects of the Cypriot problem:**
**- Security - Guarantees**
**- Foreign Troops**
**- Equal Treatment of Turkish Nationals**
**- Territory**
**- Power sharing**
**- Properties**
The Gutteres Framework is framework made by the the UN General Secretary that divides the cypriot problem in these section and give a basis on the basic principles about each section
Both sides accepted the Gutteress framework but they did so a few months after the talks failed
Sadly each side accept a different "version" of that framework
The UN didn't bother on publishing such an important document
I think the most important part of my text is to show you what each side supports in each one of these sections
I will explain in-depth each one of these 6 chapters
Before I get into that I have to tell you that the leaders of the Cypriot communities were present in the negotiations of all sections
Greece, Turkey and UK were present in the negotiations about the external chapters of the Cypriot problem, Security-Guarantees and Foreign Army
Lol ok thanks
>Turkish and Greek Cypriots should do the unification agreement with approval of Greece and Turkey
No we shouldn't have to , that's the problem
Cypriots should be able to decide their fate alone, Greece and Turkey should stay out of this . Greece already has accepted to support any plan that the GC agree with , the same cannot be said about Turkey , who is the main negotiator instead of TC
The difference between Turkey and Greece is that Greece does not have any political control over Cyprus and they are not forcing GC to do what they want
**Equivalent treatment of Turkish Nationals**
Turkish nationals(ppl from Turkey) want to have the same  treatment as people drom Greece(ofc Greek nationals ahave the treatment of any other EU national)
What does the Gutteres Framework say
Free movement of goods ( =customs union + a quota to be agreed for primary agricultural products), services and capital are ok
Free movement of persons: the regime will permit tourists, students and seasonal workers
For those seeking permanent residence, Turkish nationals should have a quota that is equitable and further discussion is needed on what ‘equitable’ means
GC side agrees on that but only with a ratio 4:1 (Greek Nationals:Turkish Nationals)The agreed population ratio between GCs and TCs is 4:1 so that way neither Greeks nor Turks will affect the demographics of the island
**Power-sharing**
&#x200B;
So this is a main topic that was being discuss a lot after the failure in Crans Montana
As we said before United Cyprus will be a BBF with political equality of the two communities
As I said before Republic of Cyprus is a Bi-Communal state with two politically equal communities
&#x200B;
Political equality is reflected in many things
Here are some things agreed for United Cyprus:
&#x200B;
30% of the Lower Parliament will be TCs
50% of the High Parliament will be TCs
Cyprus will have one president and one vice-president
(sth abut the Courts-sry I don't know much)
Special majorities will be needed for changing the Constitution and some other important stuff
The Council of Ministry will have 4 TCs and 7 GCs ministers
30% of jobs in the federal public sector will be TCs
40%(-if I am not mistaken-of the federal police will be TCs)
&#x200B;
The above are pretty much agreed
There are two points about political equality that there are major disagreements
These are:
\- positive vote
\- rotating presidency
&#x200B;
**Positive vote:** For any decision made by the Federal Government a positive Turkish Cypriot vote is needed
(so if all GCs in the Lower Parliament<the High Parliament has 50% representation of each community so a TC is needed there anyway> vote in favour of sth if no TC vote for it the decision can't be made)
&#x200B;
**Rotating Presidency:** President and vicepresident in the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus are voted separately by each  community
Originally the GC president should be voted by GCs and the TC vicepresident should be voted by TCs
TCs want rotating presidency
Every two terms od GC president and TC vice president they want a TC president and a GC vicepresident
&#x200B;
GC side: They accept the positive vote in the Council of Ministers and in wvwry decision that would affect the vital interests of the TC community or zone
People don't really like the idea of their president being a TC (or even worse a Turk) because he won't represent the majority of the people
The GC side would accept rotating presidency if  the TC
side agree on the security/troops sections in a formula that was agreed 10 ywars ago during negotiations
the formula says that both President and vicepresident are voted by all Cypriots
If this term will have a TC the president and GC vicepresident 80% of the result will come from the community of each candidate (so 80% of the percentage for the president wpuld come from TCs voted and 20% from GCs votes
Same for the GC vicepresident-80% from GCs and 20% TCs)
That way both of the presidents will try to convince people from both communities
The main problem woth this is that sinc eGV population is much higher than the TC population a vote of a TC will count as much as 6(just an example) votes of GCs
Only two GC parties accept rotating presidency as a trade ofd
The rest(central parties and nationalistic are against)
&#x200B;
TC side: They want the positive vote in every decision made in the central government
They want rotating presidency in a ratio of 2:1
(They alsp accept that formula)
&#x200B;
What does the Gutteres Framework say
&#x200B;
According to GCs
The issue of power sharing should be discussed further in relation to the issue of a  positive vote, namely when and under what conditions and in which bodies  this could be exercised, with concurrent provisions for mechanisms to  resolve issues that have reached deadlock
Other elements, such as the rotating presidency, are issues  that need to be discussed as requested by the Turkish Cypriot side (on a  2:1 ratio)
&#x200B;
According to TCs
Rotating Presidency with 2:1 ratio
Decision-making (effective participation): simple majority with one positive vote with deadlock resolving mechanism/ in cases where issues are of vital interest for the communities
&#x200B;
As you see the according to the TC side these two are not part of the negotiations and are already agreed by both sides
GC side will agree on rotating presidency but only if they get sth in return(Morphou/Guarantess-Troops)
&#x200B;
This section is probably the most important section for TCs
**Security - Guarantees**
&#x200B;
For you to understand what these are we have to to back in 1960 when the Republic of Cyprus was created
*The Republic of Cyprus had three fundamental treaties
A short summary for two of those:*
&#x200B;
*Treaty of Alliance: Greece and Turkey want peace in the island
In order to achieve that Greece has 950 Greek soldiers stationed in the island and Turkey has 650  soldiers stations in the island
(Greece has more because GCs were more)*
&#x200B;
*Treaty of Guarantee: UK, Turkey and Greece are guarantor powers of the RoC
The Treaty gave the right(and duty) to the three guarantor powers to military intervene in case of emergency in order to protect the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and restore the RoC to its former status
&#x200B;
*In 1974 GC nationalists with the help of greek junta(dictatorship in Greece) -and the help of CIA- committed a coup against the legal President of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios III(he managed to escape)
Turkey used that Treaty to justify the first invasion in 1974 after a coup
Turkey got 3% of the island and those who tried to kill Makarios lost power
Turkey instead of restoring the RoC to its former state and leave made a second invasion and took control of 36,7% of the island(violating the Treaty of Guarantee)*
&#x200B;
Greek Cypriot side wants the abolishment of the Treaty of Guarantee
They don't want Turkey to have the right to invade
Instead of that, GC side proposes a system that involved the United Nations and the European Union so all Cypriots can feel safe
&#x200B;
Turkish Cypriot side is more divided on that
The TC right doesn't accept for reason a United Cyprus without Turkish guarantees(they also don't support United Cyrus but okay)
The TC left are a bit more
positive of the replacement of current Treaty of Guarantees but it's not really their choice
&#x200B;
Turkey said multiple times-Erdogan+Cavusoglu- (publicly) that those who dream of no guarantees are just dreaming
&#x200B;
Greece supports what GC side says
&#x200B;
UK said they agree on the abolishment of the guarantees as long as both communities agree
What does the Gutteres Framework say about this
&#x200B;
According to TCs
It asserts that both communities should feel safe in a federal Cyprus, and that the security of one should not come at the detriment of the other
The framework outlines that a system in which the right of intervention remains would not be sustainable; and that the Treaty of Guarantees could be replaced by adequate implementation monitoring mechanisms, where Guarantor Powers could partly be involved
The framework states that issues related to troops (numbers, withdrawals if and when they will need to leave, timelines, etc
) will be agreed at the prime ministerial level of guarantor countries
According to GCs
\* We must begin to recognize that in Cyprus we need a new security system and not a continuation of the existing one
\* I believe we must end the right to intervene and the Treaty of Guarantee
\* They need to be replaced by a new system in which all Cypriots would feel safe
\* We need a fast implementation mechanism, which includes external features such as the United Nations, and multilateral and international aspects
Today’s guarantors may not implement and supervise themselves
&#x200B;
Security-Guarantees is one of the two most important sections of the cypriot problem for Greek Cypriots
**Foreign Troops**
&#x200B;
Even though the title says foreign troops it's mostly the 30
000 Turkish soldiers stationed in Cyprus
GC side wants the turkish army to leave the island under an agreed timetable(sth similar happened in East Germany)
The final foal is the demitarization of Cyprus
TC side wants the turkish army to stay and live after a couple of years and a part of it to stay forever
(sth like what Annan plan: rhe majority pf the Turkish army would leave after 14 years or sth)
A part of TC community isnokay with the withdrawal of the Turkish army I think(better ask a TC on that)
&#x200B;
Turkey: the above\^
Greece: Agrees with GCs side
&#x200B;
What does the Gutteres Framework says
&#x200B;
According to GCs
\* There should be a rapid reduction from the first day, gradually decreasing within an agreed timetable to numbers that would be in line with the old Treaty of Alliance
(950 Greek, 650 Turkish)
\* Guterres’ framework says there is disagreement between the parties as to whether there will be a termination (sunset) or review clause
Furthermore, he noted that further discussion was needed on the details of withdrawal
&#x200B;
According to TCs
The issue of troops is a different question relative to the Treaty of Guarantees, and to be handled in a different format
Issues related to troops (numbers, withdrawals if and when they will need to leave, timelines, etc
) to be agreed at the highest level when time is ripe
&#x200B;
This is one of the two most important sections for GCs
**Property**
&#x200B;
In 1974 after the Turkish invasion the 1/3 of thr GC population became refugees, lost their homes and properties
TCs also had to leave their houses in the south after the Turkish invasion
TCs are regarded as legal owners of their properties in the southern part of the island
On the other hand GCs refugees are considered people that abandoned their properties and have no right on them
Turkey brought people from Turkey after 1974 and many of these people were given properties of GCs refugees
GCs want to get back their properties and return to their houses
&#x200B;
GC side supports that all the refugees should be able to return to their home and het back their properties
TC side supports that the "users" that have GC properties should not have not abandon the houses and properties of GCs and isyead be considered as owners of these properties
&#x200B;
The two sides agreed on these:
(that's what the Gutteres Framework says)
Two property regimes:
\* In  areas that will be returned to Greek Cypriot administration there must  be agreed criteria so the rightful owner will have preferential  treatment but not 100 per cent
\* In areas that would remain under Turkish  Cypriot administration preferential treatment should be given to  current users, but not 100 per cent
&#x200B;
The goal of GC side is that 100
000 refugees can return
&#x200B;
It was accepted by the GC side but many GC political parties disagree with giving the "user"("thief") more rights than the legal owner
It was accepted by the TC side (but again rightist TC political parties disagree with the return of GC refugees in their houses and any population transfer)
**Territory**
&#x200B;
Turkey currently occupies 36,7% of the island
As we said the solution is BBF
Bi-zonal: 2 zones
It is agreed that a part of the area currently occupied will be returned to the GCs and will be part of the GC zone
The agreed percentage of the TC zone is between 28,5-29,5%
&#x200B;
GC side wants the return of Famagusta City (Varosha, the Ghost town rhat is under the control of turkish army), the return of some other areas and the return of Morphou(used to be inhabited only by GCs)
GC side also wants that the GC zone will have at least 50% of the coastline
TC side doesn't really want the return of Morphou
At Crans Montana Conference both sides submitted a map
&#x200B;
What the Gutteres Framework says
"The TC side needs to adjust the map presented by the TCs to respond to concerns expressed by GCs regarding some locations"(of what we understand it's a reference to Morphou)
&#x200B;
I think territory is not a main disagreement
Τhe referendum is a referendum for the Turkish Cypriot community not for the "TRNC"
The international community doesn't acknowledge the existence of another state in Cyprus (that's why the only representative of TCs is Mr Akinci as the leaser of the TC community because he is directly elected by TCs and Mr Tatar can't represent TCs abroad
So the referendum will determine the future of the TC community (the one of the two communities of the legal state, RoC)
Ofc the referendum will determine the future of "TRNC* because it will cease to exist even for TCs
Cypriot Greek is still diverse enough so that people can tell if you are from a specific district, but there's definitely a process called 'dialect levelling' going on
Especially after the immense population displacement caused by the war in 1974, but also urbanisation in the 80s onwards, mean that the different regional dialects are starting to be more similar
We have two dialects
Cypriot dialect of Greek and Cypriot dialect of Turkish
Nowadays cypriot greek is the only dialect of greek except the official one that is commonly spoken by a lot of people . Greek used to have a lot of dialects but they have slowly died mostly because of an increase in literacy
Cypriot greek itself is much closer to standard greek than how it was 100 years ago
People used to be mocked for using a lot of words from the dialect and it was ( and still is) what we call "village-y" which is associated with the uneducated villager stereotype that existed more than 50 years ago
There also used to be different dialect from village to village but because of urbanisation now there are only slight differences from region to region .
These are some of the Greek dialects
The rest are dying/dead, either because of Standard Greek popularity, or because of the Greek genocide
I am from Nicosia and I went to Pa(ph)os, where I couldn’t understand them easy
Édit: i realised that I misused the word based, so I deleted it
That’s about minority languages, not dialects
I think the dialect of Nicosia is the closest own to standard Greek
And Paphos as the most isolated district has preserved more it's dialect .
Indeed
> I think the dialect of Nicosia is the closest own to standard Greek
I think a lot of it is perception, rather than reality
For example, I have a Nicosian friend who insists he says "σίγουρα" (and similar for other  γ-between-vowels words)
He doesn't, he says σίουρα" like everyone else
But he doesn't hear it
Yes but that’s not always the case
There’s a slight difference
A minority language in a country might not be a dialect
in some cases it could
I do however agree that some answers are interchangeable
The Greek government did the Junta but everyone blames us Greek Cypriots
Calling it a  border is politically controversial since there is mutual non-recognition of sovereignty, but:
* [Nicosia/Lefkosia/Lefkoşa]
* [Deryneia/Derinya]
* [Pyla/Pile]
* [Louroujina/Lurucina/Akıncılar]
are some of the prominent ones
Of them, Pyla was the one that most operated as a unified town, and sort of like a tri-point between south Cyprus, north Cyprus, and the UK
Nicosia had three police checkpoints that allowed movement between the two halves and could sort-of feel like it's not totally disconnected
Deryneia only recently gained a police checkpoint
Now all of them are closed indefinitely due to the coronavirus outbreak
Louroujina didn't have an official border crossing, some communication was done by traversing the DMZ without a permit
In greek there is a song about Mousolini that also says some stuff related to Italy
I really wanted to visit Istanbul and Edirne this year; but unfortunately that's been placed on hold
The last time I was in Turkey was 2004 and I'd definitely like to see it again
Plus cheap food and tea can never hurt
Usually it’s pretty much between Greece/Turkey or Russia if the former are not playing
Malta, Greece, Italy, Armenia, Lebanon
Is your ancestral homeland really in central asia
Well wouldn't you say that your ancestors are primarily Anatolian and your culture while having traits of some Turkic traditions, is primarily Anatolian, Middle eastern and Balkan shared across the region
You don't see an american calling themselves swedish because they have 7% swedish DNA
Most of your ancestors basically originate from proto-anatolians (for an average Turkish person, I do know that there are some villages that do show high amounts of Turkic ancestry) so why do Turks ignore their Anatolian roots and act like they are actually Turkic
The Turkish tribes that did arrive in Anatolia were mixed up with Persians in the first place too
My opinion is that Turkish identify was created to unite people of Anatolia under the same banner and nation since the term Turk was not used by Ottomans to refer themselves instead it was kind of an insult to call some one Turk
After the adoption of Turkic Identity Turkey was created those who were not "Turks" driven out (the ones that did not convert to islam)
You can see the differences that people from different parts of Turkey have it is still a multi-ethnic country united under the Turkish identity
As for my self I don't indentify as either, in Cyprus the issue is mainly caused by religion and not people choosing and identity, identities being created by minority extremist groups in Cypriot Turks case the grey wolfs etc
Yes of course people can identify as something they are genetically not part of, but the line between that usually gets lost people lose their original roots which can make cultures disappear and people don't choose as individuals what to identify as
A group in power of the region identifies as that and enforces it on others by means of propaganda and  etc this is what exactly happened in Cyprus
After and deal was arranged with UK, Turkish teachers arrived to teach locals proper Turkish and replaced the village names with Turkish names, for example morphou became guzelyurt
Anyway what I am saying is whrn the identification is natural its okay, but not when its enforced by others other countries trying to change our identities for their own gains
Turkey
Heh Do I have to say, its still on-going actually
Surprise, surprise it's the Turks
and it would be for the second time
(My country is Cyprus)
Turkey
Its still going on
Sadly
yes it is
"or anyone else in the EU " U sure
Its still going on
It's culturally being invaded as of right now politicians are controlled, TCs are already a minority in their own de facto state, soon it might even be annexed by Turkey
[σκονάκι] <skonáki>, which apparently literally meant a small dose of medicine or drug in powder form - I never heard it used literally though
You are not wrong, it is a composition of the word for "dust" and the suffix for "little" but according to the dictionary entry, that dust was specifically a drug in powder form
It must be a very old sense (back when you could get cocaine prescriptions for coughing, I guess), I only ever heard it being used for cheat sheets
Oh wow, that's a great citation, so the old sense was at least still familiar in the 80s. It's a shame we don't have sufficiently large databases for the Greek language to investigate when the modern sense of the word was first used
I have a [Greek source] (short scale, unofficial publicatiton) and a [Cypriot source] (long scale, official publication) and they disagree
This has annoyed me, I don't know which one I am familiar with after all because I never really deal with big numbers, and I gave up
Just write out the numbers in full digits or scientific notation
EDIT: I am asking Greek speakers [here] More I think about it, the more it seems like I would read (1000) (000 000) as a thousand million and not one billion
EDIT: It looks like a billion is 10^9 in Greece, but 10^12 in Greek as spoken in Cyprus
Greece is the one that uses the American (and now British) scale though
It looks like Cyprus is using the European scale
Divided
And hot
Also slow internet
So east that it’s debatable if it’s actually in Europe*
Agreed
Bye is the normal in Cyprus(since you have to enter and exit at the back)
In Greece I rarely use the front door so I don't tell him sth
Unfortunately this problem goes much deeper than one company's policies .
There was a post about this a few days ago
I love the shapes of Switzerland, Ireland, Greece, Germany and UK
I love Crete's shape as well:)
(I like the shape of my country too but I wont brag :)
I like how l’hexagone looks
No worries
Well the border of Cyprus(being in island) is pretty unique and cool:)
Maybe the Turkish Cypriot that created the cypriot flag also loved our cool shape:)
Well ...in a way:)
Never thought of that(literally never)
I see creatures in: France, Germany and UK
Cmon man the shape is great:)
It's hard to explain:(
As a kid I was a big fan of pokemons(and I loved drawing) in my imagination some of these countries look like creatures
Great Britain is a really proud one
I still see them the way I saw them as a kid:D
(If I keep talking you will think I am crazy so I ll just stop xD)
It's hard to explain
That wouldn't be the first time where Turkey invades another country and occupies it .
Yes to a significant extent, but I have both formal training in English linguistics and informal familiarity with a number of non-native accents
Still, I think most Cypriots are at least able to distinguish native and non-native English speakers, even if they can't guess what the person's native language actually is
Paphos
Definitely paphos
Most of the time you don't know what they're saying, they have weird ethics and traditions
It's like they're not even part of the country
This is some kualiti [grik miusik]

Epic
Just
Epic
Firstly, the anthem of Cyprus is the same as the one of Greece, making it the only anthem in the world to be shared between 2 countries
It basically says that the Greeks are almighty and we finally became free from the long slavery we had
I praise it brcause it gave the country hope in so many occasions, such as: WW1, WW2, Balkan Wars, Cypriot war if independence, overthrowing the Junta in 1974 etc
It is the single biggest inspiration ti Greece and Cyprus
That's interesting
In Cyprus we drive the same way British do
I have no answer for you though, I ll try to observe that
I personally walk on the left
Υeah it's one pf the thingd the Crown left to the island (some other things were UK plugs, a constitution, military bases)
Europe is not a single country to have a price law across the board
Not even the EU works like that
In Cyprus, currently the price for PPE is subject to an [upper limit] set by MinHealth decrees
A pack of 50 plain single-use surgical masks shouldn't be sold for over 10 EUR
(EDIT: ok, that table is old, from March
[Currently] the cap is at 35 EUR for 50 pcs)
I hear complaints about the enforcement though
Smart law
Greece used to have it, they got rid of it and it was a disaster
Afaik, Cyprus never had it, and we also don't have bookstores, we have stationary shops that call themselves bookshops
Distributors and retailers who couldn't keep up with demand, especially back when the supply chain was stretched thin
That may be the reason the cap was raised
But what I mentioned is complaints about the *poor* enforcement of the price cap
People are calling in radio shows to complain about shops selling PPE for higher prices than the ones listed in the decree
But now I am wondering if they, like me, didn't keep up with the decrees, and expected March prices in August
English has it complications of course, and those are different depending on which languages you already know (e.g. I think that OP, coming from Spain, would agree with me that English has a complicated vowel system, but that is probably not a concern for someone who speaks, say, Danish)
&#x200B;
What really makes a difference is how widely used English is
As learners, we are more motivated and get more opportunities to use English, and that really makes it easier
It's true, Finnish has what we call in the biz a ["shallow orthography"] On the other hand, written Finnish and spoken Finnish are essentially different dialects so, as a learner, I was taught the same things twice
The difference between written English and spoken English is considerably smaller (I'm actually having trouble thinking of differences between spoken and written English
Maybe the use of "whom" and avoidance of contractions
The modern Greek word ("Ellada") is the same but the "H" is dropped and the suffix is different for grammatical reasons
Hi, wanna talk to me
But what about N. Irish ppl
Nice to meet you:)
No cursive in Greek-speaking schools at least since the Greek junta fell, and I hate everyone in Europe who forces me to read cursive :/
Edit: "forcing me to read" may be overstating things
I can't even read it
Disgusting, but I may be mildly allergic because I always had to leave the room whenever I could smell almost any seafood
No no no no non noo noooo
When I was younger I wanted to move to the USA , then I started watching US news ...
Being shot is my immediate concern
Greece - Ελλάδα (Hellada)
Switzerland - Ελβετία (Helvetia)
France- - Γαλλία (Gallia)
Ολλανδία (Ollandhia) -> Netherlands
Κάτω Χώρες (Kato Khores, ie Low Lands) -> BeNeLux
Also others like
Denmark= Δανία (danía)
Ivory coast=  ακτή του Ελεφαντοστού (akti tu    elefantostu) which is a literal translation of the name in greek
Netherlands- Κάτω χώρες
Are you sure
Isn't Kato Khores just the Netherlands
Interestingly Yunanistan is Lands of Yunans/Ionians which was one of the Greek tribes in the islands
Cool
Oh wow didn't know that:)
Yeah
I supposed Denmark and Dania have the same root that's why I skipped it
>  like a tropical archipelago
I mean, give it 20 years
It's used to mean just the Netherlands in European Union documents in Greek (since they have a strict style guide), and eventually that usage may become universal (as a formal alternative to Ollandhia, like Anglia-Inomeno Vasilio, Ameriki-Inomenes Polities)
So is Kato Khores BeNeLux or Netherlands
Yeah a Turkish Cypriot told me that as well which is also very interesting
In non-EU documents usage, BeNeLux
Yes, it's the direct equivalent of Low Countries
May i ask were you born there or did u choose to move

really tho
whenever i speak english my thoughts become more suicidal
maybe it's because i have an actual english accent like it's straight outta
i don't wanna say London, more southern
Hmm
I think Athens is prettier (mainly because of the ancients)
Haha thanks
I’d like to go to Stockholm one day
Well, there’s also Plaka
Ich bin das fahrrad
Yes
We already call it Czechia in Greek (Τσεχία), so no change for us :)
In Greek it's Τσεχία so it's pretty much the same
I am not used to it yet though
In the dictionaries, there's a difference between ζήλια (jealousy) and φθόνος (envy), but most of the time we use ζήλια for both
Φθόνος is archaic and tends to only be used in more formal registers
I don't have that distinction, and in my life I've heard ζήλια used for both "active" (κάμνει το που ζήλεια) and "passive" (ζηλέφκει που...) desire
What you describe may be a new development happening specifically in Greece
It's still not picked up by ΛΚΝ Τριανταφυλλίδη so it's maybe something of the last two decades
In any case, the nuance I have for both words is that they describe a negative state
I'd say something positive in that case, like ίντα καλά (how nice), or μακάρι να 'μουν τζι εγιώ (I wish I was too)
The most positive spin I can give to ζηλέφκω σου is that of a complaint, I may not really hate you for being on a better situation than me, but I am still miserable about mine and I want to mention it
But that's still passive
It looks like a regional difference
> Russian is similar in its entire country
[\[dubious claim\]]
EDIT: ["no dialects, we just use the language differently in different regions"]
Wasn’t there a Bloody Sunday in Russia too
Yes, I know about it
I’m currently studying Russian history
I have a test on Wednesday on the Bolshevik takeover
We don't have trains
It's actually growing pretty fast
We had our first actual meme last year with "posibol"
Some guy was asked about the actor of the main character of the movie Mission Impossible and he didn't know english and just said "Possibol"

When my grandpa brings fresh eggs he never puts them in the fridge
When I buy eggs I just out them in the fridge
Fresh milk is always in the fridge
Right now I have two keyboards in use
My laptop has what Lenovo calls "English - European", which is basically the US English [ANSI layout] but with the Right Alt being labelled Alt Gr
My external keyboard is the [typical Greek-English keyboard] which is derived from the US English QWERTY but in addition to the introduction of Alt Gr where Right Alt is, it has the two-storey Enter key (like [ISO] does), and has the € symbol on the third level of the key for 'ε'.
(Ex-) IBM desktop computers in Cyprus sometimes came with a Greek-English keyboard derived from the [UK English QWERTY ISO] Absolutely dreadful
The punctuation between UK English and Greek has no correspondence at all
A decent ISO Greek-English keyboard would have parallel labelling but it would look extremely busy because there's near-zero overlap
But you mind end up with a keyboard only listing UK English punctuation, or computers with the wrong layout set in software
QWERTY but because we have 2 less letters than the Latin Alphabet, the Q and the w are replaced by the Greek Question mark which is also the English semi-colon ";" and thr W is replaced with the ς, s that is usrd at the end of words (this letter is luterally only used at the end of words, but it's common because many words end in s)
I wouldn’t associate skin colour with health

Eg, Nicosia is posh af, not even Cypriot, just Greek, more Greek than Greece itself, Liopetri just speaks anti-spanish, where every θ soynd is χ and Paphos
We just joke that Paphos should be its own country because of their accent
'Cyprus' is fine
Maybe change a to y. I think the pronunciation of  y  in most languages is closer to â than a is .
Yeah but changing its name in English to be its name in Greek would trigger Turkish Cypriots
Greece
Until I saw how ugly they let their country get
Germany
Don’t get me wrong, Merkel’s done a great job with the country itself, I just don’t like how she took the Union out of the whole EU thing
Well, no
Having an international language allows for a more globalised and connected world, through better and easier communication
I just don’t like the over use of it, especially by natives if other languages
For example I’m really annoyed when people while speaking Greek use a bunch of English words in there, that’s even more annoying when the word they use has a Greek origin
No, since I consider English to be as much our language as it is the UK's.
Omg both Cypriot and Greek TV is trash
I stopped watching altogether
> Cyprus: Does their really low quality soap operas count
(Greek soap operas are not much better either anyway)
lol
Ummm no
That's not true
You are probably refering to the intercommunal violence that started way before the invasion
But keep in mind that both communities commited atrocities
Turkey have always wanted to annex Cyprus and it found the opportunity when Greece staged a coup to overthrow the Cypriot President
I don't deny that atrocities were committed
But your comment is biased and one sided ignoring the complexity of the problem
There wasn't a systematic plan to ethnically cleanse the island as some Turks claim
And Turks always seem to omit the fact that they invaded Cyprus in order to protect The Turkish Cypriots but you ended up staying forever and started sending illegal settlers to the island
Edit: grammar
I didn't expect you to explain the situation fully
But when they asked you why, your answer was sort of deductive and biased
That's not a question about Turkey and Cyprus indeed
But I couldn't simply not reply to one-sided arguments
As I said both sides have made errors
I am not claiming that Greeks are inoccent
And this is of course a debate for an another question not this one
If I am not mistaken I recently read somewhere that there are 2,000 approximately Cypriot Turkish Language speakers living in the Republic so yeah technically they are a minority even tough  Turkish is an official language of the Republic
Yes indeed
Also, note that this MEP was elected by the Greek Cypriots
It's one of the four seats of the Greek community
So this is a good step towards a solution
It also shows that the Greek Cypriots are ready and willing for it
Ok that was a bit irrelevant to the original question but since it came up I mentioned it
It was on tv yesterday (in Greece)
In Cyprus it might be on tv this weekend or on Christmas Eve
Fellahs (Uneducated Turkish settlers that were illegaly placed in peoples homes in order to turkify the occupied land
At that point, we either listened to THAT, or modern greek music
Y'know, the ones they play with the fuckin Bouzouki in the background alongside a violin for some reason and singing like a half mad drunk person
It's also close and kind of recreating the early modern Greek music near the 1850s, but putting a more Western style/lyrics into it
Like hadjidakis and Theodorakis
Wouldn’t Rempetika be popular
Kati tethkio
As you can tell, I'm not very fond of it, but I know it happened then
Sure, but isn't rempetika older
Like 30s or 20s or something
Y tho
I love Theodorakis and Hadjidakis
They are amongst Greece’s greatest composers
They used lyrics from the best poets too
(Μελοποίηση- don’t know how to say this in English)
They existed throughout the 20th century
they had a long lifespan, but yes you are right
Ne re file but i just don't like greek music
But i haven't met anyone who doesn't
Aaaa ok
Non-Greek Hellenic varieties: I cannot understand Griko, Pontic or Tsakonian spontaneously
If it's Pontic with a lot of loanwords from Greek and written, I can sort of get the gist
I feel sad that I can’t really answer this question, as Greek is alone
But as somebody who has some decent knowledge of French and fluency in English, I could understand a lot of things when I went to Spain (and literally no one could speak to me in English, as I was in a village as an exchange student)
You are exaggerating
Cypriot Greek is different than Standard Greek on all levels, but it's still on the continuum of southern insular Greek varieties (especially Dodecanese, more distantly Cretan)
With enough exposure, they can understand most of it (except the culturally specific pragmatic nuances)
There are peripheral Hellenic varieties though that are non-mutually intelligible to either Standard Greek, or Modern Greek non-standard varieties
I'm talking about varieties like Tsakonian and Pontic
Only in some private schools, especially those for the children of high-profile immigrants
There's the Ecole Franco-Chypriote, for example
I assume those too, but the people I have in mind are mostly academics and businesspeople
Those are high-status roles in Cyprus
There's a lot of EFL classes, many Cypriots get university education in English, and there are a lot of opportunities to practice the language
There are Greek-English bilingual private schools of course, but most students attend public schools
Never heard of those
German is not an obligatory subject in Cyprus anyway
French is though
Zypern ist kein Bundesland
No worries

Is Bosnia Herzegovina a joke of a state
(really, no offense, it's just that some people call it that way and ask me if I want to make Cyprus like that)
Okay thanks

Who knew that leaving ammunition and explosives outdoors in 40°C heat for two years would be a bad idea
Cyprus here, for us it was the Mari explosion
UN forbidden a cargo of Iranian armor to continue their way to Iran
They asked from Cyprus government to accept the 100 containers of explosive to be store in the Island
Those who were responsible for the matter, they decided to leave them in plain side, outside on the ground within the naval base Zigi, which is also happens to be next from our central power station of the whole country
Since no one knew how dangerous the cargo was and also they did not know how to store them, while been exposed  for a while in our environment with hot temperatures, fires and high levels of humidity, eventually they exploded, killing 12 people and leaving the whole country without electricity for 3-4 months
If the explosion would  happened 1 hour later we would have more than 1000 death toll
The power station was completely destroyed
The complete blackout lasted for 2 days in the city centers and 4 days for the borders (villages)
The first 3-4 months we would have electricity from the backup generators (which are 3 in total, 2 backup generators in the capital Nicosia and 1 in the 2nd largest city Limassol) for about 2-3 hours and then 2-3 hours of blackout and it would go like this
All the shops and buildings proceeded to buy huge generators for their business and buildings for the elevators
I personally bought a UPS for my desktop
Electrical appliances in general were in trouble because of the sudden power cut outs
Many elder people had huge problems with the situation, also many died
It was summer and summer here in Cyprus hits 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit)
When the 4 months period past, different parts finally started arriving for the reconstruction of the main power station, and slowly slowly, 1 by 1, each section was getting in place and the cut outs were becoming less and less and within 1 year and something, the frequently cut outs stopped
Nope
Never
Cyprus
It's extremely easy to go to the occupied areas
Walking is the easiest
If you wanna take your car you need to get an insurance (on the spot) and pay the fee
The population of Cyprus is over 1 million only if you include the occupied territories
The pop of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus has less than 1 million people
French and Italian definitely
Yeah, that’s how it sound to me too
I think every monarch of Greece was a foreigner, or at least partly foreign
How can you mess up Cyprus
We literally have a picture of it on our flag
Bruh
To be honest that's actually really common
I remember asking a primary school student from Greece where does he think Cyprus is and he pointed to Rhode
It doesn't help that whenever we try to describe our location we just say next to  Greece
"Η Ρωμιοσύνη εν φυλή συνόκ̌αιρη του κόσμου, κανένας δεν εβρέθηκε για να την-ι ξηλείψη" από 9η Ιουλίου του Βασίλη Μιχαηλίδη
"Romiosyne (the Greek nation) is a tribe (race) with the same age as the world, no one has been found to efface (wipe out) it"   from "The 9th of July" by Vasilis Michaelides
This refers to the hypothetical words of the Archbishop of Cyprus Kyprianos before his execution by the Ottomans on the 9th of July 1821 when the Ottomans executed a lot of the clergy of Cyprus for suspected aid to the Greek war of independence and preparation of an independence movement in Cyprus
It is written in Cypriot Greek and not standard Greek
Vasilis Michaelides is regarded as the national poet of Cyprus since he has a lot of works in the Cypriot dialect

I'd say IKEA is popular in Cyprus, but definitely considered cheap outlet - acceptable house furniture, but not for professional use
It's restaurant (probably closed now) is also seen as an old people's social club, since they gather there in large numbers
This may be because IKEA in Nicosia is right opposite the General Hospital
74 would probably not happen if there were american military bases
As a Cypriot I can assure you that I know the Greek anthem just as good as I know the Cypriot one
Well not that well, but for how good they are, for me, the further from italy and France, the worse it is, with the biggest exceptions Germany and Russia
Germany's anthem has gotten worse and worse over the years
Deutschlandlied is kinda bad, Horst-Wessel-lied is
well uh
yeah
Heil dir im siegerkranz is kinda cool, better than God Save the Queen and as good as Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser
PREUßENS GLORIA IS BY FAR THE BEST GERMAN ANTHEM
Now, the State Anthem of the Russian Federation not as good as the State Anthem of the Soviet Union, but is still one of the best anthems in the continent
In Cyprus, not really
Save an unfamiliar word once every blue moon, I never encountered a Cypriot Greek speaker I couldn't understand
There are variants of Greek in Greece though that are completely incomprehensible to me
Anything that isn't Standard Greek or Southern Insular Greek is at least a bit challenging without some prior exposure
> Cyprus speaks Greek, or at least that's what they claim
I have no idea what they say most of the time though
I mean, that's not in your country though, is it
Depends where you are from though
If you are from the south or south-eastern Greek islands (Rhodos in particular), then Cypriot Greek should be very familiar
At this point, I have no idea
I had to go and visit some Cypriot newspapers to see what they do
Thousands: the dot, the non-breaking space, or nothing
Decimals: the comma
Unfortunately in Cyprus, the currency symbol goes before the number, so € 100
000,50 / 100 000,50 / 100000,50
We use commas del decimals and spaces for thousands separators eg 286 352,63
However , if you would have used a dot no one would notice .
He throws ashtrays when he is angry:)
It is a bit claustrophobic and air connections aren't seamless
Makes you feel a bit trapped when things aren't going as good
>  how in touch are you with mainland Europe
There are exceptions and I think I am one of them, but Europeans who come to Cyprus to work for a while always note how remarkably little we care about or feel part of the EU and the subcontinent
> do you keep up with what's happening in the x country
People would generally only follow news from Greece and Turkey for obvious reasons, and to a lesser extend the UK's. Rarely do European stories for which we don't have a direct connection make it in the first half of the news bulletin
> Do you feel European
I don't even know what that would mean
>  do you have any relatives in Europe
Some very distant ones in the UK
> I think Cyprus is an island so big that it feels like its on Mainland
I wouldn't say so
Especially since the internal borders close, you can only drive for two hours before you fall into the sea
> and there is no dispute about Cyprus not being on europe, Cyprus definitely is on Europe
I don't know if it's on the European continental shelf, but that's not the definition I am using
> BTW I am curious you as a Cypriot in which continent do you think that Cyprus belong to
I know empirically that Cyprus is an island
Now, since geology appears to be this important, I went and look it up, and Cyprus appears to have arose from the sea where the Anatolian and African continental plates collided
I am not sure if that means it belongs to either the Anatolian or the African continental shelf, because in real life no-one thinks about geology
> Also do you feel more connectd with other European coutries or with Asia or with Africa
Historically and socioculturally, I find more common ground with ex-Ottoman Empire places, so places like Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Israel/Palestine, Bosnia, Serbia, and so on
The exception from this pattern would be the UK
Now, those places are not all on a single continent
Some are in Europe, some are in Asia, some are in both
I guess if we are forced to categorise Cyprus, we can say it's a cross-continental country, spanning from Europe to Asia
I just don't understand the urge to do it
Ρήγας Φεραίος!;
I think they of get drawn up in Paphos'sea
I'm sure this doesn't apply exclusively to Greek, but I always slightly cringe when I have to say a Greek word with an English accent, I have no idea why
Even so English is a beautiful mess of a language
I am not particularly worried because:
I am going back to school in November, so there's a lot of time to react to new developments
I have a certain level of trust that German health authorities will react to a second wave appropriately and close schools again if necessary
My family lives in another country and I don't mingle with a lot of people
I am not in high risk myself, nor I am doing anything to increase my risk
EDIT: Keep in mind that the 'current situation' is not the same situation everywhere
I would probably be worried about reopening if I lived elsewhere
> Not even simply washing hands after a visit to the toilet
I had a very relevant experience when I first moved to Groningen for uni
That was still when COVID-19 wasn't considered a pandemic
At the men's toilets I saw that Dutch men would only momentarily put a few of their fingers under water and call this hand-washing
I thought that if the disease ever comes to the Netherlands, we will be fucked
It wasn't that severe in the north though
Before now, I lived in the Netherlands, and there there was a discussion about dedicated university bus lines, to avoid the danger of cross-contamination so to speak
So I guess it is a valid concern
In the Netherlands, they used to strictly enforce 50% capacity on public transport until July 1st
Did that ever happen in Germany
I really don’t know why, but your country is always associated with gypsies in Cyprus
Can’t tell you what our brothers in Greece and Turkey think, but on the island that seems to be the consensus
Cheap labour that come and and still the jobs here(since they work for really low wages)
And they say Germans have no sense of humor
Well, not Greek
It's *sfirí* in the standard language, which sounds like a sexual innuendo
In Cypriot Greek it's *mátsa*, which sounds like you are calling a cat in Serbian
Here we go, point proven :P
*Seek immediate medical help if you experience an erection that looks like a sfirí.*
Greek spelling is historical and relatively '[deep] (but not as much as English)
Spelling exercises are common in primary school ('dictation'), but it never turned into a competition
It's not so much a language issue, but rather a culture difference (less focus on spectacle)
Essay competitions are a thing, but that's about prose structure and argumentation
Directly by popular vote but with a run-off election in case no candidate receives more than half the votes
The two most popular candidates go to a second round a week later
It's not an instant run-off because the week between is used to form alliance agreements with the runner-up candidates
It's the equivalent of coalition governments in parliamentary systems, only the government doesn't need their ongoing support after the election
The Parliament is elected separately
I don't actually find it sensible
It has two bad outcomes: either a wildly unpopular executive stays in power because they only need broad acceptance on election day and have unchecked power for the rest of their terms, or their coalition partners abandon them a year before the legislative elections in order to campaign, meaning that the executive can't pass any laws in the parliament (e.g. this year, they might not even be able to pass the budget because legislative elections are coming up in 7 months)
If it's going to the a presidential system, I am probably in favour of syncing the elections
What benefits do you see
Perhaps a fair point
But that's just patching a broken system
I think I lean more towards a parliamentary system
The Cypriot presidential system especially has next to zero checks and balances
It can be an elected fixed-term dictatorship if the President decides they want it to be that
If the parliament doesn't vote for their laws, they can just resort to executive orders
The equivalent for Cyprus would be "I'm voting B so that C doesn't go to the run-off election". It's very common in the presidential elections
Since we elect presidents in a two-round run-off election, if the two runner-ups (say B & C) are about as popular but one of them you really hate and/or consider a threat in the second round, then you may not vote for your favourite candidate in the first round if they are leading the polls
Similarly, if you are voting for a minor candidate in the first round normally, but B & C are really close and you think C is beyond horrible, you may abandon your losing candidate for B. (Voting for minor candidates is not always a waste, because having upper-single digits levels of support still gives them enough leverage to ask for a minor cabinet position by promising to direct their voters to one of the leading candidates in the second round)
Nor particularly common in legislatives because the system is proportional
It was allegedly important in the last European Parliament Elections, where there are only 6 seats and Cyprus is a single constituency (the claim is that declining EDEK (S&D) wouldn't get the last seat if it wasn't for voters of all other parties voting for them so that the neonazi party wouldn't win that seat)
I would say [Michalis Violaris - Ta rialia] Is a well known song with the cypriot dialect

Yes
I don't want to hear from you Uk
i have never hears of them before in the south of europe, maybe it’s more of a central european dish
People in Berlin seem to generally ride so-called sportsbikes, either rigid mountainbikes or roadbikes
I ride a roadbike myself, but honestly there are so many potholes that a mountainbike makes more sense
I don't have the money for a separate commuting and sports bike though, so it will have to do
There are also city/oma-bikes with baskets and racks around, but not nearly as much as in the Netherlands
German law is quite strict about which additional equipment a bike needs, including multiple reflectors, battery lights, a bell, maybe other things
What's crucial for me is to have handbrakes (not that dreaded footbrake all bikes in the Netherlands have), and at least a few gear speeds
Germany is not that flat, you need them sometimes
The cycling infrastructure in Berlin is minimal and not well maintained, so you have to be comfortable riding on the road
The good thing is that big junctions have bike turning lanes that really help
So far no car driver tried to make a right turn over me, they always yield
I am not sure I understand what you mean by veering in another lane
Most of the time you will be at the rightmost position in your lane so there's no danger of entering the opposite direction by mistake
I guess you have to have decent depth perception for left turns
That being said, I don't see business executives cycling in Berlin
It's mostly people under 30 and over 60
* * *
In Cyprus, only a trivial amount of people cycles at all, and it's mostly mountainbikes, both because they are cheaper and because Cyprus is quite hilly
It's not for the faint-hearted or for those who have any other choice, unless you are doing to prove a point, like I used to
In Joensuu so many locals used fatbikes, which looked weird in September but their wisdom was obvious when it started snowing
Yeah that sounds like some basic skills you have to develop before you can use a bike for your commute
Keeping a predictable course is very important on the road
Eyes on the road ahead is very important in achieving that
I'm quite satisfied with myself for surviving a Finnish winter on a basic bike without slipping on ice once (came close twice, but saved it)
But I'm not looking forward to having to repeat it, to be honest
So we are partly Europeans since we don't eat bloody meat but a dog is more than a pet
The dog thing doesn't apply to older people, at least in the Mediterranean  region

He made a biased observation
14 years
1960-1974
36,7% of the Republic of Cyprus is under foreign occupation
There are 40
000 turkish soldiers on the lands of the Republic of Cyprus
Refugees still wait to return ti their homes
So not really
Ioannina
it's just
BAD
Turkey
To visit Turkey of what I read I will have to state that I am from the "Greek Administration of Southern Cyprus". Even though I would really like to visit it some day I won't deny the existence of the Republic of Cyprus to do so
(All these not considering what Turkey currently (2020) does in Cyprus)
Not never but least likely, France
Why
Idk, not for me
But maybe remoter parts of france
I’ve been to turkey in 2012
Secular version is not very nice either I don't think that's the issue with Turkey, the issue is the extreme levels if nationalism within the country people think that everything the nation does is justified armenians, cyprus invasion, etc etc and currently stuff thats going on in Syria, imagine they went in there as operation "peace spring" and now they are waging war, on social media people are using a hastag thats promoting the war and one refugees i think in Turkey called the army "dogs" or something like that and turks found where he lived and beat him up
They are glorifying this on social media in nationalistic posts
I call Turkey bootleg USA except it seems like everyone is a patriot in Turkey
Turkey isn't even that hot in some regions
Yep
A Free United Cyprus for all Cypriots:)
Yeah but you will come as a citizen of Turkey
I am okay with having a stop in Greece-even though having to apply for visa there isn't really sth that anyone would like-(I am okay to have a stop in Greeve for many countries
Cyprus doesn't connect with many European countries with Portugal being my no1)
You had to go to Greece to get a visa right
(is what I said accurate
I went by cruise from Piraeus
But yes, if you want to go to turkey, you have to go to Greece first, since they don’t recognise us
(Ironic)
It is very mountainous thats why it snows there, Greece is much hotter
I don't think wanting the Turkish army to leave undermines equality
That's really not the case
I mean if you take a look at everything the Greek Cypriot side accepted
It's because Cyprus isn't in Schengen(even though we want to join they don't let us because of the situation)
I mean could you go in Ireland with that
Just saw this
really that's bullshit
"TRNC" completely relies on Turkey to exist
That's really not the case with the Republic of Cyprus
I just searched a bit
There is a village in the Ammochostos/Famagusta district (it's in the occupied areas)
When someone is late we say "Is he coming from Τζιάος" (it's a village that in 1973-last census- had less than 1000 inhabitants)
Not sure who lives there after the invasion
Tibuktu is also another faraway place sometimes used
Pergamos (Πέρκαμος used like Τζιάος), it was a greek city in Minor Asia, today Turkey
(I didn't know, just search)
The rest words aren't used as places
Aνάθεμα not sure how to translate it
The last word that I think is Τριβιλλουρα and of what I understand it has something to do with three(τρια) and penis  (this is probably the word that I would say if you only asked for one)
Timbuktu is used here too
(But we have other words too)
Yeah everyone ignored it since the mosque shooting gathered much more attention, just media at their usual shit, I saw the school shooting at reddit r/watchpeopledie
The University of Cyprus and the Cyprus University of Technology (CUT) . Those are the best ones since they are only public ones .
Public universities in Cyprus are better than private ones because in order to get in them you have to get a really good grade in the Cypriot national exams .
However we have a couple good private ones aswell like the University of Nicosia (UNIC) .
Speaking about the continuum between Cypriot Greek and Standard Greek in Cyprus:
> Is switching to the standard dialect something people do
Yes, while the situation is always evolving (in favour of Cypriot Greek gaining foothold to new domains), we are socialised to know when we need to use the Standard Greek register and we semi-unconsciously switch in and out of it
> or can be asked to do in your country
That would be extremely bizarre and some people would take offence
As adult native speakers, we *know* when we should use Standard Greek through our early-life socialisation
If we are not using Standard Greek in that situation, then that's because it's not socially acceptable to use Standard Greek in that situation
To enter a colloquial language situation and demand that an official register is used is a very marked behaviour, it makes you seem conceited and elitist
But, talking to low/medium-fluency speakers of Greek as a foreign language is one of the situations we are socialised to use Standard Greek for
Talking to people from Greece who haven't been in Cyprus for a sufficient amount of time (in the ballpark of 3 months) is also one of the situations we are socialised to use Standard Greek for
Here it's the same as Germany
I like my country's passport I don't see a reason to use a different one
Wait, what
When did this happen
The problem with unemployment cannot be seen with a sole lens
On the one hand, you have strong labour market protections
That means, even if the economy is doing relatively well, there will always be a small portion of the population out of employment
In these countries they prefer strong employment protections, job security and high investment in the workforce
For those who are out of employment, there is a strong safety net and of course family help
The Mediterranean countries built their model around those notions
For a time it worked, but times have changed
So yeah it was preferable to have quality jobs with iron clad contracts
As it is a high investment companies would be very sceptical to hire new people all the time
On the other hand, there is a decline in industry
Nowadays countries are becoming more service oriented so a lot of people who are not skilled cannot find work
If someone who has worked in minds for 30 years and now is out of employment, where can he work
This is a multidimensional issue, and i have already reduced it a lot
These are just reasons that partly explain the issue
But bear in mind, that these countries prefer it that way (see France for instance, 40+ days of strikes because they don't want to change their model)
In general I don't see a huge problem with permanent residents receiving that right, but I would focus on making the path to citizenship be not a malicious joke
Same with my family in Russia that lived near the border with Ukraine
We didn't like the corruption and ethnic biases; but at the same time looking back at it we at least had some form of social safety net
Now it's just full of smugglers, crime, and people trying to escape their region or vie for independence
Δεν νομίζω πως είναι ιδιωματισμοί/ εκφράσεις αυτά.
Οκ....
If you mean , speaking only my native language, then the answer would be Greece
I can piece together some German, French, or Turkish if my life depends on it, but my life really has to depend on it
But I was surprised to walk into a bakery in St Petersburg and stumble upon a Russian woman who felt bad for not being able to serve me in English, only to find out she spoke Greek
But that was an extremely rare event, usually Greek can only be of use in Greece and Cyprus (yes, even the north part)
Apparently it also doesn't hurt to try your luck with German in ex yu
When I was waiting for my bus to Ljubljana from Belgrade, some other foreigners had trouble communicating with the kiosk lady in English, until they realised they both spoke German, and then proceeded to have a lengthy conversation
>I can certainly talk to Cypriots even though there's a chance they'll only understand me without me understanding them
That's only if we won't try
I have heard that Azerbaijani is similar to Turkish but how mutually intelligible are they
Do you need to study them first a bit
Wow that's interesting
Greek doesn't have any "relative-like languages" so I can't understand how it is to be able to understand other languages
And I guess written language must be way easier right
Haha
I hope you didn't learn it by experience :p
Yes if you see it that way
I didn't consider them separate languages though
I haven't heard someone speaking Tsakonian irl but in videos and I can understand them
Again, speaking Cypriot Greek helps a lot
The same goes with Ancient Greek as well
Yes that's true
It's also funny that it seems we can understand everyone but Nobody can understand us
It would be also great if we learned the island's native languages as well
Oh that's a shame for Cypriot Turkish
I can't say the same for Cypriot Greek
On the contrary, there is a rise in its usage, even in media, films etc
Yeah learning the other native languages of the island would be nice
We currently have a program which is basically free to learn Turkish
Waffles, Chocolate, Brussels, EU, Three official languages, complex government, Benelux, Steel, Industrialisation
Federation
Yeah me too
Actually when we discuss about our issue, Belgium always pops up in my mind and I think "oh we will be like Belgium,best case scenario"
Exactly
Likr I fucking hope we will be like Belgium
plsss not Bosnia Herzegovinaaa
Yeah that's why I was thinking best case scenario Belgium
Fingers crossed, this will happen soon and it will succeed
Yeah:)
I would say Turkey but
not in Europe XDDDDDD
Anyway, in Europe
Bulgaria and the UK (and maybe Italy)
We joke about Bulgarians because we don't hate them but seriously guys
if you're gonna come here as the biggest people to migrate for a job, you're gonna expect to be made fun of
The UK because Brexit and we literally have a border with them and they can't decide for *_shite_* and because they're white af (yep literally what we do every time)
Italy
it's Italy
Cyprus is not in Europe as well geographically, modern Turkish people are Anatolian genetically just their identity is "Turkish"
These are nice :D
1) How can I get a cyprus tag
2) Yes
Geofraphically
politically we are in Europe
turkey isn't
Yeah but people are also shit so more like american people but canada's position
Εμπάθεια (empatheia)
It sound like empathy, but it’s the opposite
It means immense hate, animosity towards someone
Don’t worry, as long as you are respectful in general, people should show understanding that you are a tourist and not be harsh on you
We should all learn to be more welcoming, especially since tourists contribute to the economy and they’ve paid to travel to the destination
In Greek[1], a floor/storey is referred to as όροφος (órofos) and it's defined as the living space between two *ceilings* (compare οροφή/orofí = ceiling)
Because of that, the first storey of a building cannot help but be the one that sits on top of the first ceiling
The living space on street level is referred to as ισόγειο (isóghio; ground-level), and you typically do not refer to  isóghio as an órofos because it's not between two ceilings
It can be indicated as "0" or "GF" on elevator buttons
[1]: With the peculiar exception of public hospitals in Cyprus, which do seem to treat the ground floor as the first floor
Maybe some international hospital building code mandates that
I went on all my life thinking that Cypriots invented tahini pie, but it turns out versions of it exist all the way to the Caucasus
Is that version soaked in syrup
We have a place called paralimni
The town is near a lake and its name stands for "by the lake"
What's more embarassing is that this town is the biggest town in the free part of the district of famagusta
I really like making such lists because they give you some perspective
Pros:
*The weather
If you like long hot summers and mild winters then Cyprus is your place
But I know that this is subjective but at least something that is necessary such as sunshine in order to absorb vitamin D is essential
* Mediterranean food
* It's an island ,so access to beaches
Cons:
*Conservative society
*Limited access to Continental Europe because it's an island
*Very small
Only 1,1 milion people
>absolutely catastrophic customer service
I'm curious, what are some examples of that
Are you originally from Cyprus
Oh it doesn't matter
I was asking because you Said you would want to live here
The Polish / Yugoslavian anthems
The French national anthem
The East German anthem
The Polish/Ukrainian folk song "sokoly"
The Union version of "down to Dixie"
The Irish Rebel song "Go on home British soldiers"
And of course a lot of Russian ones
The largest geography-based identification I can conceive is East Mediterranean (Levantine)
Both Asia and Europe are way too big to be a meaningful identification
> We are not one single thing, we are the embodiment of all of these things mixed together
You just can't classify us as one single entity
So one doesn't feel more European or Asian, one feels everything together
Excellently put
That's characteristic of our region
We definitely had a discussion along those lines in another thread
I don't see a contradiction
There's plenty of progressive political tendencies in East Med, including LGBTQ activism
After all, Greece is also part of East Med and there's a lot of LGBTQ activists there, but also in Cyprus, Turkey, Israel, and with some voices becoming stronger in Lebanon and Jordan
We are perhaps fighting a tougher battle here because we have the legacies of very recent and sometimes still on-going wars making people more insular and apprehensive, but I really object to the notion that we need outside saviours to replace our political cultures with theirs
We want and need their solidarity, and we can learn from their experiences, but ultimately there's a local flavour to the conservatism we are up against, so we only those with that local knowledge can bring change that is more than skin-deep and that can last
Yeah, one has to be very cautious with adjectives like that, because they obscure so much nuance, and they also reinforce some rather problematic ideas about human rights somehow being specifically a 'European culture'.
The issue of nuance is why I think that identifying with anything more than East Med is unsuitable for Cyprus
Cyprus cannot be correctly understood if it's just examined as a European country, or if it's just examined as an Asian country
We have to zoom-in at least at regional level

I personally see it as pretty good
I think the same applies for the generations of 40+
Young people consider it bad (you can see ton of memes about "stuff from Lidl")
No thats gay af
I am a firm believer of the following process
a) If you are a representative of an organisation, you identify your self first - no matter who called who
b) If the above is not the case, then the person who initiated the call has the duty to identify themselves first
With that in mind, in Greek I answer the phone with "**parakaló**" (literally: "please", ~bitte), and in English with "**hello**".
Callers who don't identify themselves annoy me greatly
It should be obvious that (b) doesn't apply to mobile calls from numbers I recognise
If I know who's calling, I open with either "éla" (~go) or "nné" (~yes), and I don't expect them to say their name

Founded in 1960
Independence day was on 16 of August
But 15 of August is an orthodox celebration that everyone combines with vacation
As you understand everyone was on holidays these days(including ambassadors from other countries)
Anyway they changed it and we celebrate independence day on October 1st
Cyprus has had numerous problems throughout its endless history, so despite being the 3rd oldest civilisation in the world, the country was officially founded in 1960
Cyprus is wayyyyy older than Republic of Cyprus
Under standard copyright laws (with minor jurisdictional variations), work you create during work hours belongs to your employer *unless* there's a different agreement in place - in a way, your university is not even aware of their true legal power, they could claim 100% without even passing a new regulation
Copyright laws are counter-intuitive and a lot of normal social activities go against its provisions
It's obviously wrong, and if there's ever a reason for a mass student protest, this is it
My field doesn't produce creative output so the experience is different for me personally
I wrote some code in the context of research, and I slapped a copyleft license on it and my supervisors never challenged it
It's not really monetisable, so no-one cares
You are thinking of "author's moral rights". That's in additional, mostly European, set of rights that sits on top of copyright law
Almost all countries in the world (with the exception of a few in the ballpark of North Korea and Ethiopia), are signatories to a series of international copyright treaties so copyright is more or less uniform around the world
When you go to studies unless you live in Nicosia or Limassol and you are studying there
(I live in a village/town that is around 30 mins by car from Nicosia-originally it's 13 mins but because of the turkish occupation you can't go that way- and even though everyone who studies in Cyprus drives-and owns- a car most of them rent in Nicosia

Cyprus have been fully independent for only 13 years
Fan fact about Cyprus: a guy in the invasion 1974 got shot 13 times, two times to the head before dying
Yeah right xd
The son of Mary becoming king of both Scotland and England
Well, 36,7% of my country is under foreign occupation (1/3 of the Greek Cypriot population became refugees in 1974 and still can't return to their homes)
Hm okay
Well the British bases aren't considered occupation
They are legally there since it is a part of our Constitution
In fact it is a part of one of the three main Treaties, the Treaty of Establishment
The British Empire gave independence to the island but excluded around 3% of it and kept it as sovereign bases
How legal is that when the creator of the Constitution and the Republic of Cyprus is Britain is another story
All parties here asked the government last year to make steps to get rid of the british bases(there was a decision from the International Law of Justice about a similar case for Mauritius that called the bases illegal because it violate the right of self determination in those areas)
Well about the Turkish occupation
idk
it remains the hottest topic in the political scene of Cyprus for 50+ years
Opinions are different on what led us to the occupation between the leftists and the rightists and that's something that isn't discusses often between them
Unfortunately after all these years many people died without returning to their homes
Υw!

We expanded and internationalised the European community by granting European Union citizenship to the best and brightest white-collar criminals the world had to offer

That was a good one, yeah
I'm still on my Cypriot SIM even though I live permanently abroad
Thanks, Malta
You guys really tried to undercut the market though, that wasn't nice
800k EUR
That's mere corporate fraud-level criminals
At least we, with a minimum investment of 2m, only admitted politicians who robbed their entire country's wealth and made a run for it
Not a single person did it
It's a web of corruption that transcends a single member of the executive, or the ruling party
As for consequences, the fallout from Cyprus Papers is ongoing, but I have very low expectations
When everyone was "in it", no one is going to point fingers
What's worse is that there's [upwards of 6000 Cypriot kids] that remain stateless[1] because the same Council of Ministers that rubber-stamps oligarchs' citizenship applications is also using a 1999 law that allows them to indefinitely suspend the otherwise automatic process of citizenship by descent
[1]: Stateless to the extend that a TRNC citizenship doesn't mean much outside the northern part and in Turkey & by taking into account that while they have the possibility of obtaining a Republic of Turkey citizenship, most of those kids are afraid that doing so which harm their RoC citizenship application
As a result, they remain in a limbo of statelessness until they say 'fuck it, I will apply for a Turkish passport'.
Why would you do that isn’t it cheaper in other countries
My Cypriot phone number is a "stable unique identifier" - I don't often need it for outgoing calls, sms or data but it's the one phone number people can always reach me at (paying local rates and at no charge to me) even though I move countries a lot
Of course, I buy prepaid local SIMs for data where I go
> but what do you expect in a country of 600k people
How do you have more than half the population of Cyprus in less than a third of the surface area
> Yep, so you need to go to the Greek side to have a baby with any hope of a passport, how messed up is that
That wouldn't make a difference, the "problem" is that the non-Cypriot parent in those cases has Turkish citizenship
Also, don't normalise the south as a "Greek side" please
That's the partition scenario
That wouldn't be possible
We have international dialling codes that change from country to country, and different numbering plans that are either too-long, too-short or duplicates of other countries' already assigned numbers
What is probably possible is some sort of VoIP bridge that picks up calls from my Cypriot SIM, calls my German SIM, and relays the sound between the two
But that would be pointless and more expensive in the long run than buying a Dual-SIM phone
Does that mean there's very little farming and forests within the borders
I guess that's major reason why Luxembourg was always in the heart of regional integration initiatives
EDIT: Of course, I always forget to consider that not all countries are islands
I guess you don't feel claustrophobic due to the population density because the land doesn't stop at the borders
The relevant section of the Citizenship Law:
> Citizenship by birth or origin 109 .— (1) A person born in Cyprus on or after 16 August 1960 is a citizen of the Republic if at the time of his birth any of his parents was a citizen of the Republic or, in the case of which this parent did not live at the time of the birth of that person, this parent would be entitled, if he had not died, to become a citizen of the Republic:
> **It is understood that the provisions of this paragraph do not apply, *unless the Council of Ministers otherwise order*, in cases where the entry or stay in Cyprus of any of the parents of that person was illegal
This provision suspends the automatic birthday and gives power to the government to decide on a case by case basis
Within a rounding error, all Turkish citizens who enter Cyprus after 1974 do so in what constitutes illegal ports of entry for this law (all ports of entry in the northern side are considered illegal, it's very hard for a Turkish citizen to get a Visa from RoC in order to enter from legal ports of entry)
The Council of Ministers' discretion is pretty wide, but it doesn't include Cypriots born to one Turkish parent after 1974 which is pretty targeted as far as legislation goes
Those are the cases in which the government allows the suspended birthright to be applied:
> According to the criteria set by the Council of Ministers for the exercise of the above discretion, the citizenship is obtained:
> - children of mixed T / C marriages with Turkish citizens born before or on July 20, 1974
> - children of mixed T / C marriages with third country nationals outside Turkey, or with EU citizens and other countries with which it has relations with the Republic of Cyprus
> - children of mixed marriages T / C with Turkish citizens where the marriage took place abroad before July 20, 1974
> - Children of mixed marriages where the parents met abroad, such as e.g. during studies
> - children of mixed marriages residing in Pyla
Note how those "exceptions" undo the entire provision of the Citizenship Law except when the parent has Turkish citizenship and arrived after 1974 (e.g. the second point allows the process of citizenship to go on for the Cypriot child of one foreign parent whose entry or stay in the northern part of Cyprus is otherwise illegal )
That's some good maps right there, thanks
Yeah the topography is quite different than what I'm used to
Hello
I think it's everywhere
When I was at university I felt like a fish out of the water
I was the only male in my class that didn't bet
omg it's a freaking epidemic
Turkish settlers, where, when; everytime I go out soon Cypriots will be exterminated so I guess they are the ones having a culture shock in our island
wtf is 185cm average :(
My favourite Cypriot documentary is "Our Wall" (Το τείχος μας · Duvarımız)
Unfortunately, as with most of Chrysanthou's filmography, barely anyone wants to distribute it
[This] may be a source, but I can't vouch for it
I bought the DVD from him personally several years ago
A more accessible runner-up is [Sharing an Island] (2011)
I haven't watched it a second time, unlike Our Wall which I always return to
But it covers similar themes
For an aspect of Cyprus history that is barely ever talked about, there's [The Third Motherland] (2011)
You're welcome
The Arabic-speaking community of Cyprus is a surprise for most of us as well, they have been historically so marginalised with dire consequences for the intergenerational transmission of their language
We’re the only ones that put the [month and year of registration] on them so
Well here someone could be cooked alive by not turning on the a/c because of the 40 plus summer
No most people don't have a second name . However there are some people with 2 names e.g. Giorgos Constantinos , ( George Constantine) , that's a recent trend and I think it's when the couple  can't agree on a single name, especially when they both want to give the child their parent's name ( it's common for a person to be named after their grandparent here ) .
And southern Eu includes which countries
[Liberty Square (Πλατεία ελευθερίας), Nicosia, Cyprus ] designed by Zaha Hadid, completed in *just* 15 years
Although it might not fit in with the [457 year old Venetian Walls] as the mayor said (from his eyesore of a city hall), “it’s a breath of European air”
"We are too different"
We are pretty happy with the EU
The latest Eurobaromer though showed a dissatisfaction - a record low approval for the EU , because of the EU's stance on the drillings in our EEZ
I guess GCs are dissatisfied because the EU doesn't do anything about it
Overall though we are happy about it
I am just wondering, isn't that something that TCs want
If I were you, I would seriously want to be part of the EU
Even if you don't trust the GCs, I guess being in the EU guarantees that no troubles will ever happen again
My country is a separate case its not based on differences but deeper political reasons and prior propaganda it has nothing to do with the subject
How do you think the roman empire came into being, the "differences" you listed are differences that arise after we are born they are taught differences no one is saying lets instantly create this EU state, but lets just take a step towards that
It is indeed in the best interests of all of us to unite the island
I wish more people thought like you ! I am really sad that my compatriots in the North have to endure this isolation and lack of opportunities
And to be honest, as time goes by, the solution also fades away
We have got to act quickly, I agree
Locals were already living together mixed and happy they were transported from Turkey to Greece and vice versa according to the treaties between the two countries not according to individual choices
If you looked as of right now to the cultures of those countries you will notice that there are many many similarities both genetic and cultural, although the latter is more common
So how did these changes happen if they were so different from each other
Living under ottoman empire, why did the Greek independence start
Because they were opressed as Christians under the Ottomans not opressed by the others that lived amongside them, would an European federaion opress people
I did not say lets create a second Roman empire I gave that example because Roman empire was an example of a great multiethnic empire
Even USA is multiethnic, Turkey is multiethnic to actually but you know why the country does not have intercommunal issues
Its because they are united under this identity of Turkishness which was just born together with the kemalist movement after the collapse of the empire
So what I'm saying is by taking a step towards this which we already did (European Union) we are moving closer towards a world government slowly but it will get there maybe in 100 years maybe in 1000
You just said it yourself you learn your culture from your environment, so what happens to people in mixed environments there are no pure countries and with the refugee crisis almost every country is mixed to some extent, by living in the same environment you learn about others and they don't seem so alien to you after a while and you just notice that they are human too with almost identical behaviors
As a side not there are no Turks and Greeks in Cyprus, we have our own culture and identity its called Cypriot
Yeah mistakes were made from both sides
I think it helps that Nowadays our youths can communicate and build trust and Ultima put those mistakes aside so that they can live together in harmony
In our community is somewhat the opposite
At least two decades ago, we were growing with nationalist minded people
But over the years that has changed
Now I trust our people are far more open minded
As for the settler children, I honestly don't know what to say
I know it's not their fault that they are here and they have known no other homeland but it is sill a touchy subject for GCs
What do you think would be a good solution for them in the new union
(I personally believe that those who are here, are of course entitled to citezinship of the new federal state, but   i fear that things can escalate quickly with this issue)
We have pretty much unrestricted right to dual citizenship, and I haven't read a single article supporting restricting it
We don't have any idea why we would want to take that right away from people
Used to, in a rather disgraceful money-grabbing scheme by the incumbent government and a cabal of lawyers and land developers
The scheme was finally halted last November
The practice was absolutely despised and it's one more reason why even us Cypriot emigrants should have the right to vote in Cypriot elections even if we are abroad
The current government is eroding the value of our citizenship and we should be able to vote them out
> Is it fair that three million Turks who live on Germany and don't even speak Turkish can vote for a presidential dictatorship in Turkey in a referendum
What if the reason that many of them don't want to return to Turkey forever *yet* is the existence of a presidential dictatorship
They have a stake in that referendum, or in the next legislative election
I am not a dual citizen, just a resident/emigrant
If I end up becoming a dual citizenship in my country of residence, I fall under an exception and I can keep my original citizenship
> Wait, you can't?
Not this year, COVID makes it extremely hard to pull it off
But that's not my main point: I am empathising with the people who had to forfeit their first citizenship in order to receive the one of their country of residence (because I am temporarily unable to exercise my right to vote, which is what happens to them irrevocably when they naturalise in a country that doesn't accept dual citizenship), and providing reasons as to why someone can feel like they have stakes in keeping both citizenships (because several people here aren't able to imagine how you may feel that way)
> I think that's wrong, we should only vote where it will affect us
You should first defend the implied premise that we are only affected by the politics of a single place
I live in Germany (as a student), I intent to stay in Germany if I can apply my skills here and if I manage to fulfil the naturalisation criteria at some point in the future, I will pursue it as I want to have a vote in the system under which I reside
At the same time, I am -not so willingly- a National Guard reservist and I could be called to fight a war I may consider unjust and self-destructive, my family exclusively lives in Cyprus and their well-being is absolutely affected by Cypriot politics, and of course, the all-time American classic: I'm a tax payer
I pay taxes in Cyprus, I have social security contributions in Cyprus from past employment there before I moved and so on
Say something like the 2013 post-election financial crash happens again and the then government decides that they will use the Social Insurance Fund to bail out a failing private bank
There's myriads of ways that we emigrants are still affected by the politics of our home countries even if we are not there on the ground
We are even affected by some ways that are unique to us, like diplomatic relations and bilateral treaties
Whether the two countries of citizenship remain part of the same political union too affects emigrants a lot more than the rest
You need to back up that silent premise
> Can non-Germans resident in Germany vote in general elections
They are referring to dual citizens of Germany and Turkey, they are not just non-citizen residents
Are you somehow implying that the right to vote should be conditional on what a group is likely to vote for
Your sentence doesn't make sense to me, what you say after the "so" simply restates what you said before it
Can you elaborate what the rule is and what is the "that" that is a non-issue
I think *you* don't fully grasp the idea
People are currently living in one country but paying taxes in two; people are currently living in one country but being affected by the politics of two countries; people are currently living in one country but have loved ones and real bonds to two countries
This is how it works in real life
Do you thing that all people who emigrate into a new country pack all their relatives and friends into their luggage (or stop caring about their well-being), transfer all their assets, and wipe the ties to their homeland for their minds and then forfeit the citizenship so they can't be drafted in a war
That's not how emigration works for most if not all emigrants
Only very traumatic cases of emigration lead to zero-ties situations
Did you experience the kind of emigration that you think is "obvious"? Do you know anyone who experienced that kind of zero-ties emigration
> It was a more general question
Like if I went to live in Germany could I vote on grounds of residence despite not being a citizen
Well, the answer is that you can't - I asked for myself a couple of days ago
If you are an EU citizen, you can vote for the local council (and for MEPs), but not any of the other elections at state or federal level
> I feel like everyone is talking at cross-purposes on the question
Perhaps, since there was clearly a communication breakdown
But from my part, I never addressed b) which I assume means non-citizen residents
This is a thread about dual citizens
The thread is about dual citizens, the comment at the start of this comment thread was about dual citizens, and my replies were about dual citizens
If we are suddenly talking about something else, the person introducing the new topic has to signal it somehow
And that's what I'm saying as well
People may be suffering because they country took such a political turn that it has become unliveable for them, to such extend that they have emigrated
Those who still long to return definitely have a stake in the politics back in their home country about as much as they have a stake in their country of long-term residency, and they would very much like to have a right to vote
You can't make an exception to this principle just for Erdoğan-supporting Turks, or it's no longer a principle and you have to come up with another one
Perhaps you never felt like this either because you haven't been an immigrant for a long duration of time, or you have been one during times easy international travel, but I find myself in that situation were I can't vote in Cypriot elections this year even though I find them extremely important as the country is at a turning point, and that pains me
My barrier is temporary caused by the pandemic travel restrictions, but I can empathise with those who are irrevocably asked to choose between their home country or the residency country, as if they can only be affected from the politics in only one of the two as the same time
Okay, I sort of get it now
I support exactly the opposite thing
If it's really not relevant, I'm sorry but that's because you haven't made your point clear
But sure, let's end it here and let the arguments stand for themselves
Checks out
I call my friends "my mum" (μάνα μου)
It is an automatic process governed by mostly phonological rules for sure, but even adult, typically developed native-speakers of Greek do not have a 100% accuracy
According to Varlokosta (2011), when confronted with unfamiliar words, Greek speakers have an extremely high accuracy (95~99%) when it comes to providing the matching article for unambiguously feminine and masculine words
That accuracy can go as 74% when it concerns unambiguously neuter words (which are often converted to feminine due to sound similarity)
Finally, even if it concerns familiar words, there's less-than-perfect performance when it comes to nouns ending with the sounds /os/. Those can be any of the three genders, but there's a strong tendency for /os/ to become a specifically masculine noun suffix
Words moving between grammatical gender have been very common during the evolution of the Greek language
I am not even touching upon what happens with loanwords, because that's an entire book volume on its own

Usa and their understanding of "Races/Ethinc identities" are so retarded I don't even bother, they are people who got mixed and lost their original identity and now they just associate identity by skin colour
Cyprus too
We call it τάβλι. (Távli)
The capital, *Nicosia*, probably
People I meet in Europe know Limassol and Paphos from their vacations, and Larnaca because of the airport there
Nicosia, being the only non-coastal city and the least-developed tourist destination, seems to be less salient
True, they fucked up a lot of place names with the Greekification in the late 90s. I think though that, at least on main roads, Nicosia will be mentioned in brackets after Lefkosia
Ayia Napa is a village though
One of the military bases is inside Limassol - I sure hope RAF pilots know that and won't accidentally land in Yeroskipou or something
Nicosia is the capital, yes
I didn't mean to imply otherwise
I am not surprised AskEurope posters are more aware of Nicosia than the general average European
Most of us here are interested in geography and politics and therefore we know obscure capital cities
But the general public will mostly know Cyprus as a tourist destination, and the capital isn't very touristic
> APOEL
I am sorry for your loss :P
> Hold on, so Lefkosia is the correct name for the city
*Lefkosía* is the Greek name for the city and the oldest of the three names, *Lefkoşa* is the Turkish name for the city derived from the Greek name, and *Nicosia* is the Italian/Latin/Internationalised name for it derived also from the Greek but with a regular sound change
It was very common for Cypriot place names to have internationalised versions that didn't sound much like the original, the most prominent being Nicosia (Lefkosia), Limassol (Lemesos), and Famagusta (Ammochostos)
As a reaction to the mass-scale renaming campaign in the northern side by Turkey after 1974 (where Greek names were replaced by invented Turkish names [1]), in the 90s there was a similar state-sponsored campaign to make placenames in the south sound "more Greek". They didn't attempt to replace the names completely [2] but they still faced a lot of opposition by the locals, who loved their place names even if they sounded Turkish, Arabic, or Italian
That's why there's still multiple versions of the same place name in both the south and north part of the island
[1] E.g. the town known in Greek as Morphou and in pre-1974 Turkish as Omorfo, became Güzelyurt
[2] But instead they attempted to remove the "Cypriot" sounds that don't exist in Greece Greek, e.g. attempting to rename the town La**tch**a into La**kk**ia
In the end they couldn't convince the locals, and they went for the compromise La**ts**ia
But smaller towns or abandoned villages couldn't resist as effectively
Indeed
And Dhekelia is sandwiched between the districts of Larnaca and Famagusta but not really touching any city
I'm not a nazi, so no :P
In the grand scale of things a lot worse things happened in Cyprus during and after the war than name changes, but it still greatly offended the locals
Not all Turkish Cypriots agree with placename Turkification, and not all Greek Cypriots agree with placename Greekification (actually, being a Greek speaker, I know for a fact that most Greek Cypriots find it at least stupid, if not worse)
We are leeezeeee

I think all EU member states have more or less the same economic system: [mixed economy] That's a capitalist free-market economy with a non-trivial amount of state intervention
Who's politically in charge matters for details at the micro-level, but  it doesn't change the macro level
No EU country is or can be socialist
It wouldn't be possible to have a socialist EU country due to the common market and other regulations that are centralised to the EU
Also, you are watching right-wing propaganda at Prager U level
If they happen to be correct on this issue (indeed Sweden is not socialist), that doesn't change their agenda

TC For Turks; Fellah ( an Egyptian peasant) , Garasakal (black beard) , fica and gaco what do they mean
well mostly hostile words towards them felllah garasakal gaco referencing to them being uncivilised uneducated, fica is the name for sea weeds that get stuck to your feet after you leave the sea (referencing to how Turkey created the puppet state "Trnc" and moved its civil population to the island and never left to this day)
I think it was more of a throw in our faces and later a kick on our butts in the case of "lil'homeland". Now a minority in our own island

Hey, learning about 3rd Selim Suleiman Sultan's autistic inbred cousin is more important
The Turkish occupation
You mean Ottoman (No its not the same thing at all)
Now i dont want to be mean but Nicosia is the prettiest followed by Larnaca, Paphos and then Limassol
That's a really good question that I should know the answer of
Thanks for making the question, I would like to learn about it too
For a while, bicycles were being stolen by a Romanian gang(?) which would load them up in rented cars
2J beast, does some english videos too

The communities are small, but since Cyprus is also small, they are sizeable communities
Also, fun fact: In the Republic of Cyprus, Turkish is an official language, but in the south, only 2000 people speak it
In the whole Cyprus everyone is reliant of a car
You need a car
Oh, well I will only answer about the free areas in the south but I am pretty sure the same applies for the northern occupied areas
Public transport doesn't really exist
We have buses but they aren't good enough to make people use them
Every house has at least 2 cars(each person has his own)
At the age of 17 students start driving lessons, when they start studies (if they study in Cyprus) they have to buy a car
That's our driving culture
I doubt thing are different in the northern areas
(As someone who used busses, I am 19, I have to say that the majority of people in buses where foreigners, old people and young people-without driving license-)
My parents never got into a bus(at least since I remember myself)
I can answer for the occupied North
Every Cypriot has a car, universities have their own busses, but public transport is pretty terrible and almost non existent
You won't see any Cypriot in the busses (maybe some high school students), all of the passengers are Turkish settlers and students etc
(Even the driver lol)
Yeah our roads are pretty good
Unfortunately our cities aren't bike friendly(in Limassol some genious guy responsible for the bike road did that:
I doubt that could happen in any other country (especially one that call it/herself European)
I just hope the cypriot mentality of having a nice car at 17, buying a super expensibe mercedes just to show off even if you can't afford it, considering it offensive for someone to use a bus will stop
Cycling is becoming a more popular mean of exercising, hopefully it will become a mean of transport as well(considering how small distances are)(my grandpa's generation could do it
why can't we
Haha we are the same
In a bus you will only see foreigners a high school students or some ladies going to the hospital
A big number of drivers here are Romanian/Bulgarian(but they speak greek)
Oh nice xD
I ve never been to Akamas so idk
It's nice that bike road are staryingtto become popular(hopefully they will expand-a new plab for decentralisation of the state is coming and hopefully that will give the power(politically and financially) to municipalities to develop more
Because of the occupation some places are more isolated than the rest of the country so a solution to the cypriot problem would really help everything (the town/village I live-I study in Athens now- is 35 mins from Nicosia by driving now but before the turkish invasion it was 13 mins
There are more villages like this(Pyrgos which is a small one making it super isolated)
Unfortunate yes
Even if the Cypriots agree on sth Turkey must agree
The Turkish Cypriot side relies too much on Turkey
Last week the TC leader made a post on facebook that criticised the invasion to Syria(not really criticised,he just stated the obvious thay it's blood thay it's splitting not water and that he hopes negotiations will come as soon as possible so there is peace again
Many Turkish politicians attacked him(and Turkish Cypriots-rightists mostly)
If you want more info about it check my profile I made a post about it a few days ago
The thing is that the pro-EU side did absolutely nothing and let the anti-EU voice become prominent :/
Would you say that Sweden is a pro- EU nation in general or more neutral
I'm asking because on the one hand, people when asked they are in favour in general (recent Poll that was posted here recently, for instance France is far more Eurosceptic than Sweden), on the other hand it seems that it does not want further integration, it kept the krona and it was part of the frugal 4
The only method of transport other than a car that you can find in almost all areas is a bus
and you can basically get a 10 euro card for a month of transport ti anywhere
but only with your bus company which provides you with buses only in a certain area
the other companies won't accept your card
smh
It would take us about 1,5 hours
That's Greece, basketball is not just a random sport there, it's almost as popular if not more than football
This basically describes Greek basketball
Oh I didn't realise, I was just looking at it from a Cypriot perspective, here basketball does not get that much attention, it's at the point that we watch Greek basketball instead, however chaotic it has been lately
They forgot to invite
Ah yes as a west asian country we were supposed to be the +1 of the western civilised country of Turkey filled with intellectuals that promote peace
Of course because of this they have perfect relations with bordering countries what a stabilizer, we really need Turkey in that region to hold peace both in Syria and Cyprus
Very happy that we can be +1 of Turkey
Where do I begin
* There isn't a "Greek side and a Turkish side". There's the Republic of Cyprus, recognised by the EU and UN as the legitimate government of the whole island, and there's an illegally occupied side by Turkey
* No we don't have a hard-on for Russia or Putin
* No we aren't very poor
[ The average wage for Cyprus is comparable to Spain and Italy, except we get taxed a lot less
(Do not use 'nation' as a synonym for 'sovereign state', especially with regards to countries in Europe
* Last execution: 1962
* Abolished for the crime of murder: 1983
* Abolished for all crimes, including during war time: 2002
Apparently there were some reservations for the 'during war time' part, but eventually it came to pass
There's no chance of it returning so long as Cyprus remains a member of the EU and CoE
No politician or organised political group supports bringing it back
Blogging in Cyprus is dead, Facebook killed it
Citizens can say a lot of things, especially when they are angry or deeply appealed by a crime
That doesn't translate to policy
Like in many other countries, today is Easter Monday and therefore a day off
Now, "Easter Tuesday" tomorrow is also a day off only for banks specifically
That's because in their collective agreement they traded one of the Christmas holidays for an extra day in Easter
That means that the banks will be closed from Good Friday until this Wednesday, so I sure hope my rent transfer will be processed in time
But no, when public holidays fall on the weekend, they are not moved
> There's definitely a reason why paypal and Venmo are that popular
Are they
I only know of Venmo because of American culture, and everyone I know despises Paypal for its capriciousness and high fees
We solve the problem, in Cyprus, by understanding that public holidays mean slower payments
The receiver pays them, not the sender
We had to use it to collect some money to support struggling families (without giving out personal IBAN numbers) during the lockdown last year, and we paid around 70 cents as fees for each 10 EUR received
I haven't bathed in 10 years, I only shower
When I still lived in Cyprus, in the summer it was a minimum of two showers a day
Depends on where in Turkey
So its actually worse
For some less civilised parts of turkey women might be called whore, if they are wearing a skirt etc, if you are openly gay worse might happen
A friend of mine was called a whore by random people and given looks because she was wearing a skirt probably, it was in southern region of turkey
> In most cultures YOU were supposed to bring that for ME on MY birthday
Wow, I will never get used to this
My birthday = my treat
Your birthday = your treat
Asking me to do work (like bring the treats or the cake) on your birthday is bizarre
[Needless to say, if you work for a Cypriot company, you have to bring cake on your birthday
Close-knit workplaces would also appreciate it if you brought some zivania]

As far as I recall, that was a photoshopped photo meant as a joke
> I remember hearing in the news that they were deemed a terrorist organization but that's just a matter of definition I guess
Sorry to insist, but it's not a matter of definition
It has important legal consequences
On one side there was the argument that it would have been harder to convict them under the anti-terrorist provision (because there's more things to prove, and if they couldn't prove them, they would walk completely free) and on the other hand the lack of the terrorism element meant that the sentences are less severe
Every country around us
It doesn't in any striking way, to be honest
Slightly better public transport, there's a demilitarised zone running through the middle, you have to drive more than 20 minutes to reach a beach, and the summers are more hot because it's further away from the shore
I've only been to Greeve and Malta ;-;
Malta was good I liked it
I found Cyprus :D
Well Ireland is another island so they technically aren't British(they are British just because they feel British and because of their connection with the UK(they are a part of it)
Tbh it would still be weird for me if someone from Cyprus said I am not Cypriot
(it happened)
Unless it's hosted at a venue (e.g. McDonald's), yeah I don't think it's common
The birthday child's guardians are also supposed to take care of the children joining the celebration
If guests' parents stay, that's because they are good friends with the host parents and are combining the party with a social visit
In school, as a way to make student aware of the differences and better prepare them to use the expected form in a given communicative context
No, it's an absolute taboo and acknowledging differences during the education praxis is considered as equivalent to attacking the prestigious standard register of the language
In academic research at university: very
Cyprus is a hotspot of linguistic research compared to the size of our academic sector
The linguistic landscape is very rich, allowing the study of many linguistic questions with regard to variation, acquisition, and social dynamics
I feel like you are a bit dramatic but yes
Cypriot Greek is not taught, however it's very much in use even in teaching, since it's the spoken variety
The only exception might be modern Greek teachers but that still depends on the teacher
Most don't have a problem with using the dialect
It's important to mention that traditional Cypriot songs can be taught in music class or for school events . Cypriot folk songs, poems and other works in Cypriot Greek are taught as part of the literature class or again for school plays/ events
However, I do agree that Cypriot Greek should be taught / analysed in class
> Do younger Cypriots resent this, or is it not really seen as an issue
There's a lot of academic literature on attitudes and I can't do it justice here, but I would cautiously say that school-aged people tend to see themselves as the problem when they therefore perform poorly on language-related tests
Any opposition to this approach comes when they are older and have found a sense of self-confidence from a different source
But that's something observed more generally in many countries: bad education systems make children feel lacking and they won't know how the system failed them for decades to come
But the issue is definitely controversial and not far from reach at any given time
The Greek speaking world has been facing so-called Language Questions for the last few centuries
Many of them have been now resolved, but the situation in Cyprus is still dynamic - Cyprus is an extremely multilingual place to begin with and Cypriot Greek is the most active of all Greek dialects and perhaps the only one that could potentially "threaten" standard Greek if there was any appetite to do that
Other Greek dialects have mostly faded
The issue is extremely political - it's hard to do science in this climate sometimes, because research findings either upset the language-unificators or the language-splitters (those who argue that Cypriot Greek is "just an accent" or "a full language" respectively)
For example, an empirical fact that metalinguistic awareness educational is beneficial for the goal of learning the standard language is disregarded by the first group because it gives value to "the accent" even though it would produce higher proficiency in the standard language, that is a goal they like
As for the splitters, they don't so much reject the science, they are more vilified than they deserve
But they try to present their goals as 100% backed by science even though a huge part of their motivation is political and should be acknowledged as such
> I feel like you are a bit dramatic but yes
Yeah, fair, I am oversimplifying a massive and very controversial topic in very few words
There are volumes upon volumes of academic articles on the topic and I can't do them justice in-between zoom classes
> Cypriot Greek is not taught, however it's very much in use even in teaching, since it's the spoken variety
True, especially in the recent decade, but importantly not in the systematic 'metalinguistic awareness' framework that was envisioned by the cancelled 2008 reform
The way it's used, as you say, is ad-hoc and completely down to the individual teacher, without any learning goals in mind
That's less threatening than giving it a proper role to serve in the classroom, even if that role is to facilitate high proficiency in the standard language (e.g. by comparison of equivalent structures and explicit comparison of the differences on all linguistic levels)
> It's important to mention that traditional Cypriot songs can be taught in music class or for school events . Cypriot folk songs, poems and other works in Cypriot Greek are taught as part of the literature class or again for school plays/ events
Yes true, that was already the case at least since the 2000s. But again here, it was always critical to make sure that Cypriot Greek wasn't elevated to the role of a means of instruction
It's okay if it's for folklore, or if it's just ad hoc colloquial use
That was rarely controversial, but the 2008 reforms were fiercely opposed because they did the unthinkable and clearly stated that the dialect is *useful* as a teaching tool
Again, I am writing all this in such a rush, simplifications abound
I dropped in some keywords for further research

You are the only other Cypriot I see active on r/europe :)
Well I don't plan on stop being active, I will answer as much as possible xd
Basically yes, Greek Cypriots are Greeks from Cyprus
But there are Turkish Cypriots as well
Also I guess the questions about Cyprus might have political dimensions as well
Generally there are things that are different, habits etc
I mean this apply to Crete(a greek island) too,
Number 1 as most popular or as first in the channel list
It seems to be OMEGA and Alpha Cyprus, two private channels with mixed programming (entertainment and information)
The 1st programme of the state TV comes third in popularity, and then more private channels
They are not related entities any more, I think they also lost/forfeited the rights to Mega's programming
Lol no
See, that's pretty normal in Cyprus but I feel weird doing it abroad because it feels like I'm always the only one

We do not have a name for & in Greek, although it's widely used in non-formal contexts (typically not in the body of the text, but only in short spans like headings)
I think we would spontaneously refer to it as "συντομογραφία του και" (lit
"the shorthand for and")
We also do not have a name for the Greek ampersand, "ϗ" (from "και")
The Greek ampersand is only used in handwriting, since Microsoft decided not to include it in its Greek keyboard (similarly, the Greek equivalent of the semicolon, the upper/middle dot "·" can only found in professionally typeset books and in the online comments of Linux users flexing their superior Greek keyboard layout)
Often like a [κ with a comma] merged into it
Afaik it's used in Catalan, to disambiguate two pronunciations of "ll".
I certainly removes the annoyances of AZERTY, QUERTZ and the other national Latin layouts, but it's still less convenient than using the standard US English with Compose Key enabled (I prefer to assign the Windows key as the Compose key)
And there's no way out of using a national layout if you write in Greek or one of the many languages using Cyrillic
Yeah, unlike &, ϗ has a very transparent origin
Before I ever knew about it, I was already writing και as κ/, and ϗ is a natural evolution from there
At least 4 times more
Goes to show you what sort of power operating system defaults yield, they eradicated two punctuation points from Greek
Cyprus is home to the oldest named wine still in production, "Commandaria".
Commandaria has a rich history, said to date back to the time of the ancient Greeks, where it was a popular drink at festivals celebrating the goddess Aphrodite
A dried grape wine from Cyprus was first known to be described in 800 BC by the Greek poet Hesiod and was known as the Cypriot Manna
In the 12th century, during the crusades, Richard the Lionheart is said to have enjoyed it greatly at his wedding in Cyprus and to have pronounced it “the wine of kings and the king of wines
” Near the end of the century he sold the island to the Knights Templar, who then sold it to Guy de Lusignan, but kept a large feudal estate close to Limassol to themselves
This estate was referred to as “La Grande Commanderie”. The word Commanderie referred to the military headquarters whilst Grande helped distinguish it from two smaller such command posts on the island, one close to Paphos (Phoenix) and another near Kyrenia (Templos)
This area under the control of the Knights Templar (and subsequently the Knights Hospitaller) became known as Commandaria
When the knights began producing large quantities of the wine for export to Europe’s royal courts and for supplying pilgrims en route to the holy lands, the wine assumed the name of the region
Thus it has the distinction of being the world’s oldest named wine still in production
They allow people to buy citizenship and were a former bastion of crusaders
That's all I got

Guys, I am a Turkish Cypriot (an original one, not a Turkish settler) and you should know that Turkish Cypriots were really affected as well
Many TCs (Turkish Cypriots) were killed and massacred too
For example, some of my releatives were massacred in their village (Tochni) in an event known as [the Tochni Massacre]
I am not trying to justify the invasion but just wanting and hoping that you don’t only see it one sided
In the end, there are no winners of the war as both sides were affected
There was [intercommunal violence] way before the invasion like in 1950s.
Not sure if you are aware but there were two Turkish invasions
One right after the coup which was understandable and viewed positively by the international community
After the first invasion, Greek Junta collapsed and EOKA B and the coupist government in Cyprus dissolved
Then while peace talks were going on to reach a political solution, Turkey launched a second invasion which was much more devestating and resulted to the expulsion of around 200k people from north Cyprus and the occupation
The second invasion was widely condemned by everyone and this is the reason Turkey was later sanctioned and "TRNC" is not recognized by anyone
There is no comparison between Nazi Germany and Republic of Cyprus
The killings of Turkish Cypriots were not done by the republic of Cyprus but by an anti-government terrorist orginization (EOKA B)
You base that on what exactly
As long as we don't have external interference, I believe it is far more likely we live peacefully than killing each other
Damn i mossed it
What was going on
Huh
Where did I say it's ok or that we shouldn't talk about it
The OP was comparing Nazi Germans to Greek Cypriots
While the atrocities commited by Nazi Germans were approved and instigated by the Nazi government, atrocities commited against Turkish Cypriots was committed by anti-government terrorists (which killed many Greek Cypriots as well mind you)
Also a lot of Turks say that Greek Cypriot people deserved to suffer because of EOKA B actions, equating all Greek Cypriots with EOKA B. As Turks love to point that PKK =/ Kurds, EOKA B =/ Greek Cypriots
I don't see any other way we can unite except by a common agreement
> Huh
Where did I say that
I said a lot of Turks not you specifically
If you don't believe that then that's good
I just had to point it out that the atrocities were committed by terrorists that had nothing to do with the ordinary Greek Cypriot people that suffered due to the invasion
I don't see how what I said was hypocritical

Maximum Speed Limits on European Motorways and Highways
Maximum Speed Limits on European Motorways
**By *@nerdy maps*, follow his instagram acc (if you have one)**
This is the second map from that amazing guy that I reposted(I only did it because he encourages and thanks people who do that)
Netherlands changed the law in March and is now 100 (except some night hours that is higher)
There is a chance there is something wrong with Belarus but apparently with all that's going on there not many people said anything (Stay strong Belarusian People, Fight for Democracy)
**The map is in km/h**
In cyprus whatever the speed limit is everyone goes 19km over
Police usually dosnt stop you for that but if you go 20km over they pull you over and fine you for all 20km gone above the limit
Its an unspoken rule or atleast thats what my mom says
Hope its not just her excuse for speeding lmao
I don't see you posting your amazing maps though:)
In your posts you thank for repost :(
People loved this one:))
You have the 20% rule too
You will jump in the island next to Malta(Malta as a country is more than one island:)
I think in Cyprus you can drive up to 20%-1 higher of the speed limit without having problems (so 119)
I thought you were allowed up to 20% minus 1
So the max is 119
True
I didn't make the map but the guy who did used one sign for countries that are adjacent and have the same speed level so the map was not just small circles of the same speed limits (Portugal-Spain, Eastern-Central Europe etc)
Many pissed Portuguese, Czechs and Austrians <3
No highways right
Good
That was a shock for me too (does it have anything to do with Mediterranean
Lol
Yeah xD
And Yugoslavia is back together :P
Check Eastern-Central Europe:)
Yeah, that's what I know as well
The limit is 100 but you are safe to go up to 119
We have UK
A Russian user said are allowed to exceed that by 20 km I think
It was changed recently
I think in night it's 120 or 130
It's kinda obvious since all Europe use km/h(these are the signs used in the street and they also don't say it) except UK and for UK it says mph
Did they change it since sources online say 130
Well the official limit is 130
In Cyprus for example the official limit is 100 but you don't get a ticket if you go up to +20% -1 so you can drive up to 119
But it's still 100
The majority of accidents here happen from people going super fast not super slow (and we have a pretty high number of accidents)
I mean these are the maximum maximum speed limits
You can't drive in all roads with his speeds(not just in Germany)
112km/h=70mhp is enough with some maths
Careful though, don't break the bubble :P
Yeah I read that the moment I check your profile:)
Omg(I am studying uni maths right now)
Here it's 20% minus one (so 119)
I know bruh ;)
Hm okay
I kinda confuse left and right so I thought left was right:)
Some old signs in my country, Cyprus, still say miles
Oh I see
There is usually a minimum limit though

We have several non indo-European languages there
why even let non-EU companies to participate in the first place
45 years have passed and Turkey is still illegally occupying Cyprus' territory
Whats with that dumb title most modern city in netherlands
You could have atleast said halki, naxos island, greece
Lol yeah exploring the islands was much better than the storyline haha
[No its not] [2] (the car is not definetly)
I love how occupied Greece refused to vote yes, knowing that there could be reprisals
Both sides knew how *democracy* works way before the election/referendum date
One side was smarter & knew how to get more votes
Other side instead of accepting defeat, thinks of irrelevant excuses
Same old pattern ..

Turkey is a big player in this war and is constanlty proving that is the biggest troublemaker in the whole region, but still, EU refuses to sanction them

I have seen it in Manchester airport too
It was 38° at my school in Cyprus
we dont have ACs or fans
Haha that chart for Cyprus is bullshit
We recorded 45C this month
Why do you have jail bars on the windows
Is there any thought being spent on the Cyprus situation, from this opposition
Cyprus has been quite isolated from drastically different races up until the 70s. Also huge rivalries with Muslims, a sense of anti-semitism probably due to the 7 day war and stuff
Old families had ties in Lebanon during the golden years
If you are not used to your neighbour being different from you, then it is much harder to let them into your house
I'm sure there are records on who voted for what yes

You are being a bit overdramatic, you could have phrased that much better now people will think you are a dickhead
Yes I am not saying you are wrong but if you wanted to convince people you don't need to be that agressive in this situation since almost everyone would understand your point and thats why there is no need to be aggresive about it, being agressive would not convince people that well instead they would show agressiveness towards you ignoring your initial point
Thank you for your rude comment very interesting indeed
I mean I doubt this message will reach your average chinese tourists, he's message is reaching people that already did not do any damage to the fields (probably) so bassically being agressive towards people that are either did not know about it or people that were already aware of this not to people actually damaging the fields
I did not call anyone a dickhead, You are using quatation marks on things I never said just to make a point, There is no argument there to be wrong or correct he is just saying I am "the only dick" here which is something I never said I did not call him a dickhead I just called his approach agressive which could result in people having an agressive response to his statement meaning they will think of him as an dickhead
&#x200B;
Grow up
what
you are putting me in a inferior position as (immature) just to justify your stand
dissapointing
It is assuming that everyone that goes there would destroy the fields even if it is respectable guy, think of it like this someone was planing t to visit a country and someone from that country would say if you are planing to come here don't you are filthy and throw trash everywhere I know its not the same level its about how you take it since its subjective but it is in the same cagtegory with this example, instead he could just raised awareness about the issue by saying people go there and do this which casues
so be careful if you plan to visit
I understand, its just how it subejctivly appeared to be and thought some people might think like that and get offended/respond negatively (I did not)
Thank you for giving a detailed and proper reply instead of just calling me cunt

nothing I just like chaos plus europe would have an interesting geography
Yes
I am way worse at translating now
I know the words in both languages, but because I almost never use Greek online, I have to use Google Translate to remind me of my own language's words
No, because it's very close to actual English and because I learbt with it, it's hard for me to even immitate other accents including the Greek accent
>Many of the sounds english have just don't exist in Spanish and they seem to vary a lot and pronuntiation looks random
This is also a problem for  (Greek) Cypriots . We only have 5 vowel (a,e,i,o,u) sounds where as english has more than 10
For us its very hard to even recognise the difference between 2 similar vowels let alone try to pronounce them
For mainland Greeks its even harder since the don't distinguish between s and sh , tz and j , ts and ch and also z and zh
However native greek speakers have an advantage when it comes to the th sounds since we use them both in our native language
Lmao, no it’s not
The Cypriot accent is just pronouncing everything the way you see it written, but over pronouncing them, and emphasising the consonants
That’s what I’ve heard
No I'm not talking about the cypriot accent
I have a very close to English accent personally, even though I'm not even English
Ohhhh

And Imagine that I am really good in Greek Language
I even got awards for essay writings and the top mark in the final high school examination
Ummm
Yet, there are some words that I know in English/French(sometimes) that I might not know in Greek, but that rarely happens, as Greek is the language I’m best at, and more confortable with
1) Cyprus has only been (independent and) free for 14 years
2) Since 1963 when Turkish Cypriots left the governmental bodies and the Parliament, their seats in the Parliament remain there empty
3) Currently 3% of Cyprus is (two) Sovereign British Bases(UK), 36,7% of Cyprus is occupied by Turkey, 5% of Cyprus was given to the UN Peacekeeping Force and the rest is under the control of the Republic of Cyprus
4) Oldest known evidence of Cat taming was found in Cyprus not in Egypt (also the population of cats is higher than human population)
5) Greek Goddess Aphrodite was born from the foam in the waters of Cyprus
She arose from the foam when the Titan Cronus slew his father Uranus and threw his genitals into the sea

Used to, in Cyprus and Finland, but not in the Netherlands or Germany
Never really seen real snow
I would say that "still" is not even the right word for Cyprus
The island was not very directly involved in WW2, nor had any prior history with the Germans
There are stereotypes introduced by cultural transmission (via Greek and British cultural contacts), and some negative associations with austerity measures in 2013 but they are neither deeply rooted or particularly pronounced
There isn't an anti-German sentiment about wwii, ~~there is one tho about STEALING OUR FUCKING MONEY~~ ...I mean
there is none
I have a Belgian friend, and she told me her parents were very uncomfortable with her moving to Germany, and that she herself is still triggered by the stereotypical "Aryan" look some German men naturally sport
Cyprus didn't have universal healthcare until last June, and it's still not fully implemented (in-patient care under the new system will start this June), but so far I am very happy with how it works out, as a person who had to pay up to 600EUR out of pocket every year before, and had to wait for months to get an appointment (under the new system, the most I waited was two days, and my taxes went up a little bit, but over all I pay less for healthcare per year)

This isn't a translation, rather a guy that can't translate, but it's still mentionworthy here because it's hillarious and kinda relevant
In a gameshow called "Ο πιο αδύναμος κρίκος" ("the weakest link" i think it is in English), the host said the question "Ποιος είναι ο πρωταγωνιστής της σειράς ταινιών "Missio Ipossibo", Αδύνατη Αποστολή ("Who is the Protagonist of the movie series "Mission Impossible" (but he said it in a way which wasn't that clear))
The guy that was playing was a teacher but didn't understand it well, I persume, so he said "πόσιμπολ" "possibol" and got memed to shit for an entire year by the whole country
The worst translations in Greek are those who keep the foreign language's (usually English) word order
Yeah it makes sense because you see the words individually and piece the meaning together, but it's a word salad
If I read "SSD δίσκοι" or "Android κινητά" one more time
The one who made me drop a book right away though was translating the English word 'free' with the Greek word for gratis, instead of the one for libre
It was the entire point of the book, and if the translator didn't do enough research to get that right, then why would I trust the rest of their translation
Article 1
The State of Cyprus is an independent and sovereign Republic with a presidential regime, the President being Greek and the Vice-President being Turk elected by the Greek and the Turkish Communities of Cyprus respectively as hereinafter in this Constitution provided
I doubt it will happen in the end, but it will be a true mess if it's not the same as both Greece and Turkey
If it happens, we should all be in the same, be it +2 or +3, [to avoid what happened in 2016]
It only lasted for one period
During that winter with half of Cyprus on +3, a horrific traffic accident happened that was attributed to the timezone change:
> But on Tuesday the debate took on a more sombre tone when bus carrying children to school in the north of the island collided with a lorry, killing the driver and two teenage girls
> Protests erupted, led by angry students, who blamed the accident on the fact that it is now darker in the mornings than it was before
Unions have announced a series of strikes, with protests outside the prime minister’s office calling for resignations of several ministers
During that winter, after the incidient, the authorities in the northern side changed the working hours to compensate for the lost day light, and next winter they switched to following EET with a DST change at the same day as the southern side
There's no unanimity and no urgency
EU27 is not known to embrace the "move fast and break things" approach to doing things
"Died in committee" is more EU's style
> switched from left-hand side to right-hand side driving on the road
If politics stay in the current trajectory, it's entirely conceivable that this would happen to northern Cyprus too and it's going to be stranger than fiction
There isn't really more traffic in the evening in Cyprus, but we are also just discussing perceptions: that experiment in 2016 was met with public hostility
The oldest(most ancient) pet cat(domestic cat) was found in Cyprus (not Egypt

It's kind of too wide for a question
It's normal I guess

Granted im a bit on a mountain, but the heatwave went away and im freezing in the morning
Well I am not in Cyprus right now do I thought it was like that xD
Yeah I can imagine :)
I’m sorry i think you accidentally added a “n’t” to

Assuming you mean what shape for the Latin 'a' when writing by hand:
Usually ɑ. Sometimes ⲁ. a never comes out right
I think most Greeks write α by making a circle and then and a ι with or without lifting the pen
Some people do write α the way you described it but they are probably a minority
Why displace them like they did with us in the 1920s of course
What a way to annex land
Move everyone you dont like
I don’t think Cyprus has any best kept secrets, so imma use Greece
Ermoupolis, Ioannina, Methoni, Gytheion, Xanthi, Kavala
Some of them are to some extent known, but not very much, as other areas like Corfu, Chania, Rhodes etc
I’m not even gonna mention the absurdity of Thera and Mykonos
We've basically been consuming Greek media  since forever
Cyprus is a tiny country with a very small number of local productions and a small music industry
So, our talented people go to Greece to find success
That's why our creative industries are intertwined
We watch the same TV series, films, listen to the same artists etc
Even in talent shows and really shows,  it is extremely common for Cypriot contestants to participate in Greek shows (like The Voice, Big Brother, Survivor etc
) As I said above our media industries are so intertwined that both Cypriot and Greek Artists represent each other in Eurovision
That being said, the last few years there are more and more co-productions (Cyprus and Greece)
In the past, everything was filmed in Greece
Nowadays with co-productions there are numerous TV series that are filmed in both countries with both Greek and Cypriot actors
We also have some local productions
So every TV seasons there going to be 5-6 Cypriot shows and 10 Greek shows (that number is just to show the analogy
I have no idea about the actual number)
As far as the news are concerned we are certainly well informed about Greek politics but they are not so much mentioned in the news
Although we share the creative industries, we have so much going on on a local level that our news are more domestic with a few news from Greece and the international scene
However, the gossip TV shows that are displayed in the afternoon are full with Greek celebrities stories

Thanks for the more thorough response
I am a radio and newspaper person, and on those, news from Greece feature very little, not much more than other international news stories

Sometimes I'm not even convinced they really are the lesser evil as time goes by
The progressive half of the political spectrum in Cyprus is practically empty
7% but very thankfully on the decline as it was close to 65% in 2000
Some websites give lower numbers, IDK why
Nah Serbia Greece and Russia are higher
My sources may be flawed**********
That many asterisks are needed because people may give varied answers or studies may not be complete
Yeah soz I'm stupid
I believe i saw it somewhere, hold on
I don't know if I'm entirely truthful, but some studies have it different, I guess the study I saw was the men, i shluld have mentioned that, but it'd be estimated to about over 40% for adults
Studies aren't very specific
Each one I find gas a different value
For my country, I'd say less than 1%, because of how religious literally everyone is
The only women I've seen topless, are grandmas from central or Western europe and it is quite a few
I'd say 10%
Though, I would Google an exchange student’s name to find who they are on social media, (as they are a stranger), I certainly wouldn’t brag about it, and would definitely not mention something as personal as a close relative let alone a parent passing away
I’m not native, though I did study English Literature as an IGCSE (my exams were cancelled) at the english school i go to, so I understand everything (Though I suppose you don’t really need to have studied English Literature to understand Shakespearian English, due to its similarities to modern English) apart from old and Middle English
I still wonder how that’s connected to modern English or even Shakespearian English
Scottish seems to the most part understandable
Ps the first extract you provided us with is from Macbeth
Very recognisable
I love that part
It’s so funny how Birnam Wood literally goes to Dunsinane hill
I’d love to do the same thing with Katharevousa Greek, Attic Greek, Koine Greek, Medieval Greek and maybe the Pontic Dialect, but unfortunately I think it wouldn’t work as few would have any knowledge of the forementioned forms of the Greek language
EME is mostly okay, and ME requires some extra effort
Still, less effort than what I need to exert when I read Greek from that time (Medieval Greek)
Obviously OE is totally opaque to me
> I’d love to do the same thing with Katharevousa Greek, Attic Greek, Koine Greek, Medieval Greek and maybe the Pontic Dialect, but unfortunately I think it wouldn’t work as few would have any knowledge of the forementioned forms of the Greek language
Do you think such a post would make sense in /r/AskEurope, or will it be only Greek Cypriots and Greek answering
For one, I find Medieval Greek already removed enough from Modern Greek that I struggle to understand it (recognise words, sure - but what did they mean back then
That’s exactly why
It wouldn’t be possible to do something similar but with the Greek language
Maybe it helps that I know some French, so ME spelling is not surprising
The main factor with Greek is that from the beginning of the Hellenistic period up until ~1980s, it always used some sort of artificially ancient-sounding and purified from loanwords version of the language as the written standard
It's only in the last half century that written and spoken Greek resemble each other
That's called diglossia, and modern examples include Finland and Norway
In Cyprus bonfires are associated with Easter were young people make big piles of wood close to a church and light them up at Good Saturday night after the message of Christ's resurrection
Traditionally an idol or something  that represents Judas is burnt in it
This is a dangerous "tradition" which the police tries to prevent
We've had a lot intercommunal conflicts where Greek and Turkish nationalists would not only clash with one another but also with members of their own communities that were viewed as "traitors" .
One of the most famous ones  was that of 1963-1964
It was a series of clashes between Greek and Turkish Cypriots that resulted in the death of hundreds of Greek and Turkish Cypriots and the displacement of thousands more .
You can find more information about it at:
A Cypriot that doesn't eat souvla
That's not me of course ;)
Sun: Hλιος - Helios (male, an ancient greek god)
Moon: Φεγγάρι - neutral
Or another word is Σελήνη Selene female (ancient greek goddess of the Moon, sister of Helios)
Sun:
Ο ήλιος (Helios- male)
Moon:
Η Σελήνη (Selene- female)/ το φεγγάρι (Fengari- neutral)
It would have to be during Frankish (1192-1489) and Venetian rule (1489–1571)
Lots of huge gothic Cathedrals, fancy castles and wall fortifications, Venetian palazzos, language flourished, Petrarchism etc
This lovely story completely and abruptly ended in 1571 (when the ottomans won the siege of Famagusta
Unfortunately not many records such as poems art and buildings etc have survived)
Then, we have the 90s up until ~2010, that was a great period for Cyprus, and there was a lot of wealth
(Referring to the Republic of Cyprus, dunno about the occupied areas)
Ottoman period saw a lot of representation of the different religious and ethnic groups extended, too
Not to mention the libraries, bathhouses, roads, aqueducts, and other Ottoman buildings that were influenced by the existing Gothic architecture
Venetian rule brought a lot of trade to the island
Yeah, but it’s evident that the Venetian and Frankish periods were the most prosperous
The Roman Empire was part of the history of most european nations
I most definitely agree
The Italian peninsula was the first area to become “Roman” and thus was the most important possession and hub of the Roman Empire, and by extent where most Roman cities were
Still though, Rome did not stop in Italy, and expanded
Napoleon is part of Italian history btw, but yeah got your point
Not really those are just « name translations », that kinda make things easier
They did that a lot in the past and in almost all languages regarding any name of any ethnicity
people don’t really do that anymore
In case you are referring to Carolus Magnus or Charlemagne, then I will agree he had no right to claim Kingship of Rome
If you are also referring to « La Joconde », then you are also right, they shouldn’t claim it
Hmmm
Yeah maybe in Italian
I’m generally speaking here
In Greek Voltaire for example is called Βολταίρος (Voltairos)
But we don’t do this with all names
Not much history, it happened a few years ago, bit I'm gonna say it
There was a play set to premiere in my small, little village, which play was organized by the Cyprus Theatre Organisation (THOC) itself
We are very very very religious and the play was a play about gay men kissing or something like that
The priests didn't like it
They banned the play from performing and a few days later, THOC kicked us out of the partnership which my mother herself tried so hard to bring to the village
We became the laughing stock to the ENTIRE NATION
EPIC
Cyprus btw
Oh yeah I remember this
The play was well received in Nicosia but somewhere in Famagusta people protested right
I mean I don't remember the village but I think it was in the Famagusta district
Deutsch, Mandarin
As basically the biggest economic power in Europe, we have to learn German in order to basically survive in post-UK EU
As a rising economic power and already the second biggest without even unleasing its full potential, China is looking like the next great superpower, soon passing the US, and with the rapid urbanisation, it's going to be difficult to compete without the support of the Chinese Market
They day will come when everyone will be speaking mandarin and the world will only have one nation: "Zhongguo"
A bit cynical, but I have to thank Greece for blackmailing the rest of the European Union in admitting Cyprus as a member state even though we had no reason to be there
It really improved my quality of life and allowed me to pursue opportunities that would be harder to come by if I didn't have freedom of movement
[Efxaristoumi Atina, efxaristoumi Ellada]
I think if a person from Mainland Greece gets enough exposure he will understand Cypriot Greek
We of course understand you as this is the language we are taught, hear on the news and read
I was amazed once to hear a guy from Rodos
They speak a dialect extremely close to us
Ι agree with you
r/europe isn't really a place to discuss things in a healthy and respectful manner
Lemesos/Ayia Napa(and Protaras)
I mean, yeah, it is Cyprus
if you want a good hotel, you're gonna go to Limassol and if you want a good beach you're gonna go to the South-East, where there are a lot of beaches but they are way overblown with the amount of tourists they get
they support our country A LOT, but still, they're not as good as tourists have been told
The beaches are small amd usually uncoordinated, you will hardly find a hotel big or good enough close to the beach, services are jack shit
usually
If you are going to come to Cyprus, do go to these destinations, because they're not bad as well, but also go on a trip to the mountains
There are a lot of tours around the island and especially around the beaches and Akamas peninsula, but there hardly ever is a tour to Troodos mountain, but at least when there is there are quite a few people going
In our mountains you can find so many types of animals, non-British trees and imo good services, such as restaurants,tour guides and even 1 skiing place I believe
you can go see Saint Nicholas and Agros, 2 places that make our bottled water but also have amazing hotels and tour grpups, as the beaty of the places is just phenomenal
in the mountains outside Limassol, idk exactly where, but, there is a wonderful art Museum about the history of Cyprus
So yeah, beaches isn't everything we've got
Larnaca doesn't have that good beaches, but yep, still amazing
people from Larnaca are arguably the most civilized in Cyprus and that's amazing
They also have the Camel park in Mazotos which is amazing
We don't get many tourists from scotland
nost are English and Russian
in the latest years A LOT OF RUSSIANS
There's no such thing as "normal" in Cyprus
Seriously tho, yeah
it's because Larnaca and Nicosia are cinsidered by us Cypriots as well to be more civilized and less mad about tourism
Limassol, Paphos, Ayia Napa, they need to put all those signs because tourism
Ayia Napa entirely bases itself on tourism so I mean they kinda need to have the signs
But yeah ik what you mean
Larnaca is more "nornal" so to say
Of course I know him
It is me
Not really
I was referring more to the fact that us Cypriots love arguing about stuff, especially politics
Plus I am a Turkish Cypriot :p
Isn't kiss in Swedish piss and piss in swddish kiss or smth
Idk
Well in history class it was easy to memorise one of the reasons why Arabs/British/Turks/Latins/French etc wanted and got control of Cyprus, the geographical position
It was back in the 90s...
Ever since the 2000s, everyobe owns either a Japanese or a German car
There's a traditional song we learn as a children which is gory as hell
Four plus four equals eight,
Four young men are going to the battle
Searching for water high on the mountains,
They find a 100 fathom deep pond
They draw lots on who will go down,
And the one who loses is the youngest one
"Tie me tight my brothers, for i will go down,
I will get the water out of the deep pond".
His brothers tie him tight,
They get him inside the pond
"Get me out my brothers, for i have found the water,
But it looks red, and black, and poisonous".
Until they pull him up and get him out,
The serpents and the snakes have half-eaten him
"Tell my dear mother to dress in black,
For she will never see her youngest son again".
The only one I've seen here in Cyprus was more a large building banner than anything else
It wasn't even religious; it was paid for by some religious society but all it was was a big thank you to our doctors and nurses
If you have a cypriot flag you are leftist
If you have a greek flag you are rightist
If you have both, hello bro
It’s not odd, but people don’t really care about it
We are not like all those other countries that are super proud of their flag eg
The British having their county’s flag on tea cups, or even bath courtines etc
That’s so weird in my opinion
You will most probably only see it in government buildings and schools/ universities
Plus, people also prefer hanging the greek flag on their balconies, which is also quite rare
But, I’ve literally never seen a Cypriot flag on private property lol
I don’t think that’s mostly the case
It’s merely just a matter of identity
If you have both, you are a government building :D
In my life I think I also ever saw 2 or 3 Cypriot flags on private households
Also, on the Ayia Napa highway, there's a house flying the [Apartheid South Africa flag] What's the story there, I wonder
That's how I see it
Must be an ambassador’s house
Also government buildings only have the Cypriot and EU flags
Nah government buuldings no longer have both xD(the have the cypriot and the EU)
If you have both you are a school:)
(I saw two houses in my village having both)
I guess they came back from South Africa (I know a few people that grew up there and returned)
Ok, fair enough
If the ambassador flies the Apartheid flag, their home country did something very wrong when appointing them
Woah, is it not a normal South Africa flag
Whoops, I just saw it, that you were talking about an apartheid flag
I though people were referring to the ambassador’s house, which is also by the highway lol
Exactly
I don’t get why everything has to be left or right, even with flags
Don’t we as people have the right to identity
Frankly, flags are a vital part of it
No, it's a more controversial flag than the Enosis flag, up there with the Confederacy flag in the US
I know what it is . learned about it in history
I probably didn’t read the whole comment
I thought the person above was referring to the ambassador’s house by the Nicosia-Limassol highway
I’m so absent minded lol
Haha my Mum pays €28 for 4 GB (which just got upgraded from 2- for the same price)
[A certain song] was playing on the state radio when it was [taken over by army coupists in 1974] The song is still associated with the coup through cultural ambience, but it's more visceral for those who were actually alive back then
People remark that the lyrics before the interruption were eerily relevant, but you could likely spin any lyrics to make them sound ominous in that context:
> "The blue shirt,
> one we wore in turn,
> gold thread and stitch
> **who will judge the murderer…**

Here we say "email"
In Greece it's common to say mail too
No, I haven't heard that fortunately
In Cypriot Greek ίμεϊλ (ímeil) is the most common (is it pronounced ιμέιλ (iméil) in Greece
Thanks
The pronunciation ιμέιλ stands out for me, so that's the one I remembered
Is saying just 'μέιλ' more common in Greece
With some modernity bias:
a. Greece/Eastern Roman Empire,
b. Turkey/Ottoman Empire,
c. The UK/British Empire,
d. Umayyad Caliphate[1],
e. Republic of Venice/Crusader Kingdoms/The Templars[2]
Runner-ups: Egypt, Palestine - a lot of the British Empire's actions in Cyprus were directed by developments in the other side of the southern Cypriot coast
[1]: To a huge extend the reason why Cypriot Greek evolved separately from Medieval (Byzantine) Greek as that period was marked by a prolonged lack of contact with other Greek-speaking populations
[2]: This is a bit too vague, but they kept selling Cyprus back and forth between them during that time so you can't pinpoint it
One historian called the Venetians the most ruthless of all colonisers of Cyprus as they introduced and ran a very intensive feudal system
It also laid the foundations of the Ottoman conquest that it was to follow
Greece/Byzantium, cause we're Greek Cypriot, where I live
Turkey, occupied Greece and Cyprus for 4 centuries, also illegally occupies 37% of the island currently
UK, occupied Cyprus from 1878 till independence in 1960
In order of importance
South Slavic polities probably paid a big role too
At least I remember spending a year in school learning about the Balkan Wars
I think [this] is what you're looking for
Old but gold
It says "Πόσιμπολ" or rather "possible" but in Greek letyers
It's a meme from a gameshow, where the guy was asked who's the main character of Mission imPOSSIBLE
He just said posibol
Greece, obviously
We have the same anthem, the same language, about the same history, more economically tied than the other countries, the only thing separatibg us by now is the political/economic stability and us not being in the Schengen area (and the accent)
You literally can't tell apart Nicosia from Athens (other than the market areas)
Is "TRNC" considered a (real) country by Turks
Well, Turkey is indeed the only country that recognises it
also it has full control over it, so to which extent it should be considered a self declared state and not an annexation is really questionable
Thanks for answering
Some TC politicians say they want to have a relationship with Turkey as equals, a fraternal relationship
Do you think this is possible
(considering that economically, politically and militarily is dependent on Turkey) or do you think that such a relationship can ve established only if the cypriot problem is resolved
(or it can never be established
The Venetians built a ton of other great structures, eg the walls of Negroponte, which WE destroyed
I think [this] is clearly the very best design ever
ένα καράβι!
"It sounds like Spanish" for some odd reason
This is for Greek
For the Cypriot dialect, even Greeks are confused
they don't even know what we are saying most of the time
Reading "buongiorno," I thought of it both in an Italian and a Russian accent
for the past 5 minutes I've been thinking "Lol Lenin in Switzerland" and "Lol Socialist Mussolini"
Depends
if you know, what region was it from
Exactly
I've heard of it before and it sounds like even more turkish gibberish
If our cypriot dialect isn't a reason for reunification, I don't know what is
Yeah
that is exactly why I said it
Yeah makes sense
Athenians sound closer to other Europeans
Also the Ionian archipelago is closer to Italy, I'm not so sure about that
So I guess it sounds closer to Romance there, which I didn't think about before
The further away you go from the capital, the more weird it may sound, and let's not talk about the islands
Crete is closer to Cyprus rather than Greece linguistically
Ye I've noticed that a lot
Well not so much in Limassol or Paphos but certainly in the less touristic areas like Nicosia and Larnaca
Everyone's becoming so goddamn posh there
Compared to our size we try as well:)
But it's nice to see that Greece Italy(and even Turkey) are appreciated by Western Europe for their efforts
My house is downstairs-garage, upstairs-house so downstairs always locked, upstairs only at night (we have a porch/kitchen/side door that has a handle that can open on both sides) plus we live in a village with a population of 200, 150 of are our relatives lol
The Investment program, and the subsequent corrupted politicians involved in that shady scheme

There's also Uclan Cyprus bht that's foreign and also apparently the University of Cyprus is the ambassador for Microsoft in Cyprus
Something liek that
For me, personally, The song called "Famagusta" by Stelios Xiotis
it's a rather sad song for the city that's, let's just say under the management of anonther country for the tine being, so we don't cause controversy
One of the most beautiful syrian songs I have ever heard
Shit just relazied this is ask europe haha
Well i'm Cypriot as well and my favorite song from cyprus is this  ahhhhthe memories ️️
Yeah, I don't think I can
Do you have any specific questions
Victoria, Edward, George, Edward, George, Elizabeth
So uh
Boy: George or Edward (half the population of males is called George anyway)
Girl: Victoria, Elizabeth
Technically our monarchs and technically not
Idk
Currently it’s [Αθήνα μου]
I remember that in the early 10s this song was very popular in my school: "ai se eu te pego" by Michel Teló. I don't know why though
Oh, I am so sorry, you have the same language so I got confused
Yes
Plateia Eleutherias in Nicosia
Ugly, concrete structure, with jutting out lights (making it easy to trip), peeling benches, random holes (easy for accidents), and not aesthetic, ruining the area, where the Venetian walls stand, covering the walls and making the moat look 1000 times uglier
Also it was extremely expensive
Ancient ruins have been found underneath it during its construction as well, which has forced them to make changes in the way it was to be built, as these “ruins” -basically a bunch of rocks, had to be shown through glass on the ground
Still not furnished- and bound do become even worse and uglier
Also, our roads are terrible, full of bumps and no proper systems for taking down the water when it rains
There are no special parking places for bus and bus stations are literally in the middle of the road, blocking traffic
there’s also a lack of pavement in many areas
On the good side, our municipal theatre now has a roof
Groningen seems a bit panicked
I saw a pharmacy selling antibacterial soap for 15 EUR / 250ml
And that wouldn't be more effective against viruses than standard soap, afaik
>Power points: In Ireland, we have the big, clunky UK 3 pin plug; using the same plugs as mainland Europe would make buying electrical appliances much easier and would offer greater choice to the consumer
>Driving on the same side of the road - In Ireland we drive on the left side of the road, whereas in most European countries (after Brexit, I think the exceptions will only be Ireland and Malta) drivers drive on the right side
It would really open up the import market for cars and campervans from Europe if we also drove on the right side
We have those 2 things as well ( thanks to the British Empire)
Yes
We should give them Emphasis on native languages
The wide teaching of English leads to wearing of the culture
Even though [it lasted only for 8 days] it remains extremely divisive
I can't say for sure that there's a taboo around it, but bringing it up will always cause tension
It's less of "we don't talk about this" and more of "okay then, lets go outside and settle this once and for all". No justice was served then, and people are itching to either punish the coupists, or to defend them from the non-adjudicated allegations
English because almost nothing is available in Greek
It's good to improve my English as well
I'm from a fairly rural area
The biggest stereotypes are: weird accent, vulgar language, rudeness (in most rural areas mostly not in mountains), bitching and having arguments over farms (generally true), bad
very bad drivers, a lot of buses I've heard one time in rural villages like in Famagusta or up in the mountains
That goes for urban areas as well
We're not creative
We just blame others for the things we do
> What ddI you think of the explosion in Beirut
Eerily similar, but vastly more destructive than [our worst explosion] I hope the Cyprus government is doing everything they can to help Lebanon, and not limit themselves to thoughts and prayers

at least that I know of
May the Others take you
Cyprus (areas under RoC control) in 2011: [Romanian] (it's Russian if you only look at citizens, instead of all residents)
The  name Andreas (Andrew) can be spelled Ανδρέας or Αντρέας, using a τ (Tau)  instead of a δ (Delta)
Ανδρέας should be pronounced /an
ˈðɾɛ.as/ and Αντρέας /an
ˈdɾɛ.as/ (with a /d/ instead of /ð/)
However, in Cyprus both are pronounced with /d/ since /nð/ is harder to pronounce than /nd/ .
It's not possible since the President (both head of the state and head of the government) has to come from the Greek Cypriot Community
It would be controversial if they weren’t born in Greece or Cyprus
I’d say either Greece or Turkey

> How is the political situation in your country
12 parties ran for the House of Representatives (the RoCyprus Parliament), and 8 of them managed to elect MPs
No party has an absolute majority, but the two largest parties have more or less 3/5 of the seats between them
The two dominant parties are always opposed to each other
RoC has a presidential system, so this has no bearing to forming a government
For legislation though, the government has to rely on the support of at least the third largest party, which is not a given on an election year
The fourth largest party and the rest of the MPs are rarely relevant in the legislative process, their votes usually matter if the official opposition is trying to pass a law (but most of the times, even if they manage to pull it off, the President vetoes it or it gets annulled by the equivalent of a Constitutional Court)
> Do you feel you have sufficient choice
Despite having a decent number of parties, and a relatively low electoral threshold (used to be something like 2%, now it's 5%), almost all political formations have a socially conservative (or at least cautiously moderate) and a near-universal nationalist rhetoric
Their fiscal stances are never clear-cut and depend heavily on which of the big two parties offers them a better coalition deal
> Do you think your own values and political convictions are matched well enough by any one of the political parties on the ballot paper
It was always a matter of either voting to prevent the greater evil, or voting to elect the candidate that would most grind the gears of the neonazis
Of course this gets tiring after a while and certainly doesn't make you care about elections as much
Nowadays I place more faith on local grassroots campaigns on very specific issues
>nationalist rhetoric
I wouldn't call anti-Turkey view nationalistic we are in a war with them after all
I don't think most parties have nationalist views like "Cyprus first" or "migrants should leave".
Depending on level of formality in Greek
* δεκτόν (ðektón): *accepted*, formal
* πάσο (páso): [I will let it] *pass*, casual
You can also use έστω (ésto, *so be it*), or εντάξει (endáksi, *OK*)
Officially:
Surname + First name + [of “Father’s First Name”]
Eg a random example would be
Papanikolaou Stelios Konstantinou
This name would unofficially be:
Stelios Papanikolaou (First name+ Surname)

Saint *Basil*, and in Cappadocia (modern-day Turkey)
Yea, I think Greeks are the only ones who have St
Basil (that's literally how we call him)  instead of Santa Claus (St
Nicholas)
Basil is celebrated on the 1st od January
That's when he also brings the gifts to children (not on Christmas day )
Yes, I meant Greeks in general (Greek-Cypriots included)
Greek Cypriot public schools have a confessional religion class, i.e. it's a class that presupposes that you are Greek Orthodox Christian and aims to strengthen your faith and provide you with the Church's philosophical and social stances on a series of issues
It does have a 'survey of world's religions' component later in highschool, always done from an Orthodox POV (Christian "heresies" for example, like Protestantism or "naive and primal beliefs" like Shinto)
The justification by the supporters of this arrangement is that Greek Orthodox Christianity is the majority religion of the country and that since public schools exist to cultivate the students' sense of national identity, teaching the religion is vital
It's always controversial of course
Over the years, parents of students of different religions won some level of exemption from the class, always facing resistance from teachers of course
Some Orthodox Christians also oppose the confessional nature of the course, but they are a minority among their religion
Humanists and leftists who oppose organised religion also protest the existence of a religion course, but without much success
Public school teachers, when seen as an organised societal group, lean conservative hard and any government attempt to reform the educational system towards a non-confessional or non-militant orientation is opposed
I liked that: Teaching religion is illegal in France
I wish more countries had that strong secularism
I have a question though
I've read other comments here  that Catholic countries (Spain, Italy, Austria) signed a treaty with Vatican teaching kids the Catholic faith
That wasn't the case of France
In Cyprus, the student's parents have to officially declare that "our family adheres to a religion different to Orthodox Christianity and therefore we ask for our child to be exempted from Religion class". Irreligiosity is often not accepted as 'a different religion' (it's up to the school principal to accept or deny those applications) and those families are initially denied exemption until they escalate it all the way up to MinEdu
I wouldn't paint Cypriots with a single brush, since for one there is vocal opposition, just not a successful one
That's because the Archbishop of the Orthodox Church of Cyprus (whoever he is at the time) yields a lot of political influence over every elected government
The Minister of Education de facto needs the approval of the Archbishop
For another, there's a fifth of the Cypriot population which is traditionally Sunni Muslim and is committed to secularism and strongly oppose religious education in schools (which nevertheless increasingly happens against their will as Turkey tightens their cultural grip on Cyprus)
There is big portion of Cypriots that are very religious, however their views are much more progressive that those of religious Muslims
But we also have some who are just religious on paper and only celebrate the major holidays with feasts etc
The class itself isn't taken seriously by students with older students (14-18 year olds ) sneakely doing homework for other subjects during the lessons
It's seen as an easy subject were you will get a decent grade without doing absolutely anything
If you get a good teacher then it's fun since you can discuss with them different topics
A big portion of the teachers are those who couldn't become philologists ( Greek/History/Ancient Greek/Latin Teachers ) and not religious fanatics
However this heavily depends on the teacher, there some close minded ones that are misinformed
Priests can also become religious studies teachers but again that isn't necessarily that bad if they are good
Me either
I've just read the comments here
Add Croatia to that list as well
It seems most "Catholic" countries have an agreement with the Vatican to teach their kids the religion
Probably not at all
If they could they would throw us out
Exactly
Good wording
I didn't mean that they would literally throw us out but what you've said it is more accurate
We seem to be a liability that constantly proves difficult to handle (e.g. the recent debate with Cyprus demanding Sanctions on Turkey)
Obligatory: It's not free, it's paid by taxes and/or an insurance mandate (in the case of Cyprus, a specific healthcare tax on each source of your income - all can use the system, only those with income contribute)
I don't even live in Cyprus any more, yet I pay (extremely low) contributions on the interest accrued on my savings
Well, the current problem our system is facing (except for COVID19 having broke it) is the so-called "supermarket mentality", where people show up at their GP with a list of specialist referrals they want and pages upon pages of tests and diagnostics they want to do, without any medical indications
That is exactly the habit they carry over from pre-2019, when we didn't have universal healthcare and everyone was either avoiding the doctor allowing health issues to accumulate (good case scenario) and people with the attitude of since I already paid my insurance contributions I should be able to get everything from the menu (bad case scenario)
That lead to some very strict rate-limiting protocols right now, that are unfortunately needed now but they are not sustainable in the long term
Another problem that was characteristic in the first year of the implementation was getting medicine suppliers on-board
I think it's mostly fixed by now with only seasonal variation in the brand *names* available but during the first 12 months many of us had to still get our medicine from the state pharmacies that used to exist inside state-owned hospitals instead of the NHS-affiliated private pharmacies that is the case now
I know rationality that we should expect a lot of problems with an NHS system that is barely 2 years old
I think that by the time it reaches 10 years of use, any major issues will be ironed out
But it's very easy for political forces that want to privatise healthcare and introduce a non-universal system to attack the NHS now, in its infancy
On the other hand, the waiting lists issue that is usually cited as characteristic of universal healthcare systems, isn't actually that much of a problem in Cyprus
It's limited to certain specialisations only, but we had a shortage of e.g. neurosurgeons even before the NHS
I sometimes called my GP or a specialist under the NHS for a health problem and they told me "can you be here in 15 minutes
" or "can you come tomorrow
" and that was too *early* for me to make it to an appointment
Obviously it wasn't during flu season, doctors have more free time in the summer
> Imagine you have to pay 14,6% from your monthly salary and you never get ill or injured
Oh to be 20 and be convinced that you will be forever invincible :P

Also French: (5555)
Cinq milles cinq cent cinquante cinq
Aka the Chinese number
The 25th, typically with a big family gathering at noon, and parties in the evening
The day *after* Christmas is also a holiday, but not today
As for *the* presents, they are opened on January 1st, name day of Saint Basil
But *other* presents are exchanged through-out the holiday season as families meet each other
It's still [Lent on the 24th] so for practising Greek Orthodoxs it would be very strange to celebrate and have dinners on the 24th
Yes, of course
My point is that it's rare for families to organise any Christmas-related festivities on Christmas Eve, because we don't have a tradition on doing that (and we don't have a tradition of doing that, because when the holiday wasn't as secular as it is now, people weren't allowed to have dinners)
Cultural inertia in other words
It may be changing due to American films though
After all, I even heard of some people giving presents on Christmas instead of New Year
In terms of popularity Ayia Napa is quite famous abroad
It attracts a lot of young people who want to party; especially people from the UK, Russia, Germany and Scandinavia (mostly Swedes though)
It is seen as a wild spot with an amazing nightlife (pre Covid :( now unfortunately everything is empty in Cyprus) It also has the best beaches in Cyprus
They are always categorised in the lists of best beaches worldwide
In terms of the amount of tourists, I think Paphos has  more tourists
It is seen as a calm and chill place
It usually attracts older people and families
It is quite popular with Brits, Russian, Israelis and Germans
In terms of rich People, Limassol is more popular with them
It has expensive restaurants, 5* hotels, it is also a shipping hub and has a lot of amenities
It attracts rich Russians, Arabs and Israelis
Agia Napa
Definitely Agia Napa
It's got a lot of hotels, a lot of beaches and in the future a bigass marina
Either that or Lenessos with skyscrapers+some beaches+a marina
Absolutely
We have achieved so much
I hope to a further integration
Yes
I mean the “country” I am is is not in EU or is recognised (TRNC)  but I am happily a EU citizen (Republic of Cyprus)
Hey
I guess the ordinary person would feel that the only benefit is the ease of travel
But really, the EU is doing so much more
A very strong example that affects people's lives is the Employment protections
We have got them thanks to the EU
The paid leaves, the sick leaves, the protections
Another one is the quality of products we've got
The standards are very high
For contrast, you can see the standards in the US
Another example is how the UK was considered the sick man of Europe in the 70s. After it joined the union, its economy was one of the fastest growing ones in the world
This resulted in people having a better quality of life
The same goes for all the countries of the former communism bloc
Their income quadrapled since joining the union
It's safe, so long as the house pipes are well maintained
But most people buy bottled water anyway
A bit of prejudice against it, and a lot of "it comes out too hot to be pleasant to drink" for most of the year
But I would say only weirdos will not use tap water for anything that requires boiling (making coffee, cooking)
We mostly use those "office" water coolers at home
Public transport is non-existant and people just don't want to stop using their cars
Lack of public transport (apart from busses)- Nicosia
Nicosia Cyprus capital has the ugliest sky line in Europe
Seriously Google Nicosia Cyprus and you won't be able to even find a single photo of an interesting land mark
Unfortunately this is the result of years of neglect because most of the development money goes to coastal areas which are visited by tourists leaving the capital which has no beach to die
Well
ppl love the convinience of their car
I use buses to go to Nicosia
75+% of the people
in the buses are non-Cypriots
Maybe if the bus network was better people would start using them more
Yeah
but again public transport is even connected with social status(especially for people that work)
Many students will get their license on the day they become 18(they book a test on their bday
I mentioned it another thread here, but basically that there wouldn't be massive cultural differences because I was atypical for Cyprus, and because I had many multicultural experiences before and I was western-educated
Living in an individualist society like Finland still feels strange to me
How would you describe the Netherlands on this aspect by the way
I will be going to Groningen for an exchange semester soon, it will be nice to know what to expect
The moment I realised was when I was returning to Finland after my winter break, and my taxi driver didn't utter a single word while driving
After a 20 hour journey to get back to Finland on New Year's Eve, I was honestly in need of some conversation and my taxi driver wasn't offering it
But to make it more general, it's things like people standing a meter away from you in queues as if you smell bad or something, or when you mention some difficulty you are facing they just acknowledge your problem but make no offers to help because you are not family or a close friend
Cyprus goes to the other extreme
Case in point, a few years ago when I still lived in Cyprus and I was waiting for the bus, I started talking with an old man I just met and by the end of than conversation he was offering me a job I didn't even need since I was already employed
Some people here say that for Greece
> Did you try to start a conversation with the taxi driver
Yeah, I tried to do some small talk but the driver wasn't following me up with questions, so after a while I stopped bothering him
>  Just remember that Finns don't act like that because they don't like you or are selfish, it's because they respect your privacy and personal space :)
Yeah, I didn't doubt this at all
Finns have been the most polite and tolerant people I've met
And Cypriots can be *too much* in your business, it's a double edged sword
I wish we could average the social mores of Cyprus and Finland, and live somewhere in the middle :D
> If I have a bad day, having a nice chat with a barista or taxi driver can be massive in lifting up my mood
Twice in Cyprus, I had baristas remember me and ask how I have been work-wise for more than two years after I last visited/they last worked at the café we met :D
I readily admit that we swing too much in the other direction
Yeah, there's the language aspect too
My Finnish is not up to a level to hold a full conversation yet, so I spoke in English
Like most Finns I've met in the last half a year, the taxi driver spoke very good English, but he wouldn't follow me on on my small talk
I mean, to be fair to the guy, his job is to drive a taxi, not be my conversation partner
I mention that anecdote because it was the moment I realised that I truly moved in a different culture now and my assumptions aren't compatible any more
&#x200B;
Edit: But even the language aspect is a difference, I've travelled in ex-Yugoslavia quite a bit, and the drivers often spoke very little English, but were all very eager to talk to me and either inquire about my culture or explain theirs
I would never call that bad behaviour or bad customer service, I want to be clear about that
Well, since you brought up monopoly, my taxi-related complaint would be that they are so unimaginably expensive
I guess this relates to what you mention, I read something about all price limits for taxis being lifted and every company can charge what they want
Are Welsh taught in Cardiff as a mandatory class at school
I have some cousins that were born there and I am wondering of they can speak Welsh at all
Wow that was fast
They are like 25-30
Did they teach Welsh back then
(I was really surprised to learn that Welsh is more used than Irish)
Okay thanks
I think it's the feeling that we belong in a bigger family, although being different
Especially for those countries that are also part of the EU
I grew up in the EU and I just have this feeling of togetherness
It helps that now it is easier than ever to travel and to connect with other Europeans through a lot of amazing initiatives (Erasmus, volunteering etc)
It's not a popular idea
Most people like the EU the way it is
But there's a few who want further integration with the Ultimate goal being that of the United States of Europe
There is also this political party
The only Pan-european party
United we stand ️
Was the Euroscepticism prevalent before the eurocrisris and Brexit and coronavirus
Or do you think that In the last decade with a series of unfortunate events(e.g. the global financial crisis and the subsequent eurocrisris)  this has led to the increase of Euroscepticism in Italy
Exactly
Most people can't agree on the reforms
But what I meant is that some People wouldn't want further integration, thus preferring the EU as it is
On a national level, there are two groups of countries those who prefer further integration and those who don't.
Yes there is Volt as well
Well I said the Federalists were the only one because as far as I know (their info on their website) they are a political party whereas Volt (again info on their website) is a political movement although they have a MEP
That's interesting
I thought that Italy being a founder of the then community, it would have been a supporter
Why do u think Euroscepticism was always there
That's so true
I agree with your points
Sadly that's what has led Britain to vote out of the EU
Basically politicians use the EU as a scapegoat to justify their failings
I also get what you mean
Italy didn't benefit the way Germany did but surely it helped
I was just surprised because I thought Euroscepticism growing in Italy was a recent event
I didn't know that it has always been there
I say "I am thirsty" (because I want her to bring me a glass of water
"Pee and drink"
If I am angry "Headbutt the wall"
If you don't like what she says "Drink vinegar"
When she is doing housework and you ask her what are you doing, "I kick the dogs out of the village"
"Wear more clothes"
"I don't feel cold"
"You are but you dont know it"
Turn off the heater, sun burns stones (oops, this is something grandfather says)
Haha yeah
My mother a week ago:
"Oh I am cold
Wear a jacket
Greek has a very historical spelling of words
This leads to the same sound being written with different ways depending on etymology  and grammar .
For example:
The sound /i/ can be written with 6 different ways
/e/ with 2
/o/ with 2
/g/ with 2
/af/, /av/, /ev/, /ef/ also with 2
some times /ks/ is written as κσ  (ks) and not ξ (x) .
There also times where a constant is written 2 times but its pronunciation is the same in standard greek  for example t and tt make the same sound
In Cypriot Greek however double constants have a distinct pronunciation but we tend to pronounce single consonants as double constants some times so it doesn't really help as that much with spelling
Reading Greek however is pretty straight forward as letters and letter combinations have only one sound each . Stress is also always indicated with an accent . The only part that's not as predictable is when the /i/ sound is pronounced as /j/ when it is followed by another vowel but that's something that only foreign speakers may struggle with .
Yeh almost always in Turkish as well
In Cypriot Greek, the following feel natural to me but afaik the younger generation has imported a lot more terms in the language:
Re (compare and contrast with Turkish *be*, Balkan *bre*)
ye mu ('my son' literally, but can be used even towards people of roughly equal age, and it has some discourse/pragmatic nuances we can generalise as being 'reproachful')
kori mu ('my daughter' literally, as above)
I have so many alternative answers:
The need to get rid of them is low in mostly cashless societies
Policy inertia
Germans love them
Any store that rounds to the nearest 5 cent has my loyalty
(Hell, with inflation as it is, soon I wouldn't even mind rounding to the nearest 10 cent)
Judging from the responses of other Germans (and also Austrians) in this and other similar threads, I'm not as optimistic as you
Even though so many countries did it already, you always get those comments claiming they are certain merchants will always round up and never down
Well, I definitely welcome those news
>  it should be illegal to say so but then keep more of your money
The times you lose 2~3 cents on a receipt are offset by the times you win 2~3 cents thanks to rounding, so at the end of the year you are either short by few cents or over by few cents
I will gladly lose few cents *every time* if it means I don't have to carry useless copper coins that even the cashier who gave them to me as change doesn't want me to use them to pay them
What happens with those coins any way is that I either leave them on the change tray, or throw them in the bin
Sure, I would be in favour of them doing that, but also if you stop paying their X.99 items, I guess they will feel less of the need to use them
And others already mentioned fractional cents
There's already no 1/2 (or 1/10) Euro cent coin and we still accept that we lose a few cents over time when we buy products by weight or volume
I conceptualise the rounding differently
I feel that pay a few cents as a 'service fee' each time I buy something with cash so that those coins stay out of my wallet
It doesn't feel like a lie, but as a convenience
Here, it's either you be a boy scout or go football training
wither way you'd still find yourself somewhere up on a mountain not knowing wtf you're doing
In Cyprus, not really because they either do post-office branch pickup, or signed delivery
Recently they began installing packet stations too, I think 11 are operational but they require a subscription
In Germany, well from my experience alone, also no
It's either in-person delivery (but no signature) or handed to a neighbour with a notice identifying them left in your own postbox, or if none is possible, pickup from a Paketstation
What is sometimes a problem though is in some student housing complexes, where the "neighbour" is the property manager, and they leave packets in an area without access control or attendance so that everyone can pick up their items at any item (but also potentially other people's items)
Another thing is that if the courier is DHL or Deutsche Post, packages are delivered to `/dev/null`. But that's DHL, not porch pirates
I also briefly experienced it in the Netherlands (signed delivery) and Finland (pickup from branch)
It's a simple sentence, and Greek and English are not exactly strangers
I expect it to be easy to understand
Γεια, λαλούν με Γιάννον, εχάρηκα που σε γνώρισα. Πόθθεν είσαι;
Hi, they-call me John, I-was happy to you have-met
Whence are-you
Wouldn’t John be Giovanni and Johnny Gianni
Γειά, με λένε Ιωάννη, είναι χαρά μου που σε γνωρίζω. Από που είσαι;
Hi, me say-they John, is happiness my that you meet-I. From where are-you
Ps there are many ways to say this sentence
and in Greek it really doesn’t matter where you put the subject, verb, or object, so there are even more ways of saying this
This translation would be different depending on whether you used the word “to say”, “to call”, or “my name is”.
Also it would be different if you spoke to someone bigger in age to you, or not a friend/ person you know/ is close to you
This could’ve been said in the plural form of politeness
Wow
Interesting
This proves how simple English is
I’ve heard Turkish is a difficult language to learn
Το «λαλούν με» εν θα εγίνετουν «they say me»; Αφού η αυτούσια σημασία της λέξεως λαλώ (στα κυπριακά) μεταφράζεται στα εγγλέζικα ως to say
Verbs in Greek (and other languages), sometimes have different meanings depending on the syntactic frame they are in, so λαλώ *κάποιον κάτι* (call someone something) is different than λαλώ *κάποιου κάτι* (say to-someone something) and λαλώ *κάτι* (say something)
I will give a more transparent example:
μαθθαίννω ισπανικά: I learn Spanish
μαθθαίννω τον Χάρη: I learn (about) Harry
μαθθαίννω του Χάρη: I teach Harry
μαθθαίννω του Χάρη ισπανικά / ισπανικά του Χάρη: I teach Harry Spanish / I teach Spanish to Harry
For the technical terminology here, this is about indirect objects (έμμεσα αντικείμενα) in different cases (πτώσεις)
In Greek instead of you’ve broken my balls, you can say you’ve broken my liver
Yes, but the verb by it’s self, Λαλώ would be to say
And since this is a word to word translation, you wouldn’t consider it on a technical aspect
Well, whether the verb λαλώ, or any verb in any language, has a meaning before it is placed in a sentence, is actually quite controversial in Linguistics for all sorts of theoretical and empirical reasons
It's not as simple as it looks (as linguists, we don't even have a good definition about what even is a word, but for sure it's not 'a series of letters with spaces around it')
I don't want to go technical here since the point of this thread is to have some fun seeing how different word order can be in different languages
Between institutionalised bullying and loss of career opportunities and time-restricted scholarships, hardly anything to reminisce about while serving in the Greek Cypriot National Guard

>entáxei
In Cyprus we say "nta" as a shortening of "entáxei" but OK is also widely used
It was first created , and then it was split  , you'll never guess by whom , now they are trying to stitch it back together .
It’s been fucked up by other countries
Limassol looks more modern compared to other places in Cyprus
It has modern architecture and skyscrapers
Also the Limassol Marina, the old port and Molos (promenade) were all constructed/renovated less than 10 years ago
I'm not doing the regex again, from the top of my mind it's a tie between Orá (Ορά) and Sha (Σια)

The Republic of Cyprus government cannot collapse because of the presidential system
The only way it has happened was by war (in 1963 and 1974)
Regardless, due to the Citizenship by Investment scandal in 2020, the current government was the first since 1963 not to have been able to pass the budget bill yet
Under a different system, it would have collapsed in December
The only restriction I can find in the law is that one may not have more than 3 given names and 2 family names (141(I)/2002 Art
43)
Anything else is probably down to cultural norms, and cultural norms around naming are extremely strong in Cyprus and that's why can only choose between six names: Andreas, Andros, Andrikos, Andri, Androulla, and Andriani
> You can't use the name of a living parent or sibling, use a lastname as a first name
Wow, you guys just prohibited 90% of the Greek Cypriot naming practices :P
Also I want to add, that in Cyprus if you want your child baptised in the Orthodox church then there has to be an saint whose name that coincides
This isn't an actual law of course, but more of a religious stipulation
Some priests are anal about it
Some aren't and can twist the rules a bit (like they did with my 'Western' name when I was baptised)
I know recent cases where the parents couldn't go with the name they wanted because of it
Though the cultural naming is still strong with the boys, I'm happy to see that the girl names are becoming more and more varied these days
> I work with the programs used for the name registry
Interesting
Are there technical limitations, like string length
> In that case the ID or passport would write "Gouilliam or William" (same for last names)
I hate that ELOT standard
We follow it in Cyprus too, but I got my first ID card soon after it was introduced to I managed to get a romanisation that was half-way towards the romanisation I wonted
The ELOT one would be unpronounceable
From the leaked citizenship-by-investment passports though, [naturalised citizens get to keep their romanised spellings without the OR thing you describe]
> Apart from that, we discourage Greek born parents from the non official variants of the names
A person called Giannis is always registered as Ioannis, Vasilis as Vasileios, Thanasis as Athanasios etc
How come
This is one of the main differences in our naming conventions
We register Μιχάλης, Γιώργος, Θανάσης, etc if that's what the parents wanted
Governments of foreign countries don't get to change your name, they have an international duty to accept other countries' travel documents
They may start applying conditions on you once you try to naturalise and become a citizen though
Usually during naturalisation the restrictions will be more relaxed than the restrictions they apply on citizens from birth
In Cyprus, you will just be given an official Greek-script spelling for whatever name you have (a Turkish-script spelling is a theoretical possibility, but that would have consequences that are a story for another time)
In 2011, there were at least 26 Ναπολέων living in Cyprus, but Ναβουχοδονόσορ must be one colourful character
> This isn't an actual law of course, but more of a religious stipulation
Indeed, and it's important to emphasise because in some other Orthodox-majority countries it's different: in Cyprus, baptism has no legal effect
The name you register with the government is the one that counts
One of my brothers was baptised with a totally different name (not even related) than the one he officially has
He (and we) only uses his official name
But of course, culturally there's extreme pressure in getting baptised
If you don't want a Church-approved name though, just register the name you want in the civil registry
> Paris
I wonder if the courts would accept a child named [Paris after the mythological prince] It's a relative common name for Greek speakers
> I don't think Cyprus uses ELOT , I am only seeing Panayiotis with y.
We were more lax about it in the beginning, but we have adopted it in the last decade
In the past, the procedure was that there's a default romanisation scheme, but we could choose to diverge from it as an individual right ([page 2, point 6] [That's not the case any more] (page 3, point 5)
My spelling with 'y' got grandfathered, but if I have children, they will probably not have the choice
I would be okay with automatic romanisation if it was a system other than ELOT, but if it has to be ELOT then I believe people should have the right to diverge from it
> Everybody in Greece is really familiar with Γεώργιος, Αθανάσιος, Μιχαήλ etc
When someone calls and says his name is Θάνος I always search for Αθανάσιος. I think our system is better as there is a standard
If you're official name is Αθανάσιος, you can be called Θάνος, Θανάσης etc while if you are eg registered as Θάνος, you're always a Θάνος.
I dunno, I can understand having a small number of limitations on names, like reasonable length and nothing that is obviously harmful to the child, but I can't justify giving the government the right to decide which variant of my name I should have on my papers
If there's no reason to restrict something, it shouldn't be restricted
Name changes aren't particularly difficult in Cyprus in any case, if a Τάσος from birth decides they want to be officially known as Αναστάσης or Αναστάσιος in adulthood, they can just change it at the Civil Registry
Is there a way to officially record stress in written German for purposes like that, or do you just hope the civil servant is understanding
It absolutely depends on the situation and what's my role there
If it's an emergency or an important yet complicated discussion, and we have other shared languages we both speak better than you speak Greek, let's use them
If I am working service and I have a queue forming up behind you, please just use English
Otherwise, yeah go ahead
When I was studying in Finland, the student tasked with introducing me to how things work around there warned me precisely not to greet people in Finish at the start of a transaction if I intend to speak English to them and that I should save my greetings for the end of the transaction
What really stayed with me is how polite Finns were, even though I never managed to connect with them culturally
And at least the people I encountered were quite chatty too, which was a welcome surprise so far up north
That's opposed to lets say, the Netherlands, were I also lived, which was both a case of no cultural overlap and I felt like I was personally attacked every other interaction (Dutch/German directness)
> Around 18:00 is pretty standard here at least

You guys are full of Italian tourists
I was so surprised when I visited Malta last year
There were loud Italians (no offense) literally everywhere
I’ve seen a brochure about boat trips to Sicily in my hotel lobby
So if you are a Tunisian who knows Italian, you can easily learn Maltese
Got it
It's heavily discouraged, and if someone decides to report it, the parents get in legal trouble (it happens occasionally, mostly affecting single-mothers with immigrant background)
I have looked for statistics on this and similar issues in the past, but the open data only uses extremely broad crime categories so no such analysis is possible
This is rather the impression I have from following the news very closely for the last 15 years
Single immigrant women have the least access to support networks since they have no stay-at-home partner to take care of the children, walk them/drive them to school and other activities and chaperone them when they play at parks
They also don't have many or any family in Cyprus to help with child-rearing in the place of a partner other than slightly older siblings taking care of their younger ones
The above means that they are in a position where they have to let their children walk alone to school, afternoon activities, or playground and/or stay at home alone after school more often than married women and/or women whose extended family lives in Cyprus do
And then, someone has to report it to the police
Greek Cypriots living in the same town are actually quite likely to know each other, so when they see a Greek Cypriot child roaming outside alone they already know where to find the parent, and police doesn't get involved
More recent immigrants don't have that level of social interconnectedness, so a worried witness who sees a young child outside without a parent can't think of anywhere else to turn but the police
Finally, Cyprus Police is more likely to let Greek Cypriot parents (compared to non-Greek Cypriots) get away with warnings instead of starting criminal investigations each time there's a report against them
That's again something that makes it in the news distressingly often - the last few years have been marked by domestic abuse cases, family murders, suicides, and murder-suicides in Greek Cypriot families that were attributed to parental abuse that was made known to the authorities but no action was taken
"Abandonment of a child under the age of 16" is the crime in question, and leaving a child at home for a few hours technically counts as that
It's up to the legal system to decide if the case is worth pursuing, if the police decides to charge them
Why would the parent have to drive the child or why would it have to walk
You don’t have busses
Having lived in all sorts of places in western/northern Europe, I have now gotten used to seeing children roam about freely, but the first few months were bizarre
I am still not over how a 12 year old who only hit puberty the week before was doing Loss Prevention checks on me in Albert Heijn though
I am pretty much on the same side as you about nurturing children's independence and resilience
I see merits in our collectivist culture on other aspects, but our child rearing practices are not part of it
It fails both men (who are never taught how to live alone, and instead are hand-delivered from their mother to their wife), and obviously the women who are tasked to take care of them as a 'self-evident responsibility' to the expense of their own freedom
There's no "legal hypocrisy" though, because the span between 15 and 17 is when young people gradually start receiving legal rights and responsibilities
E.g. you can't work if you are not at least 15, and before 16 it's restricted to a couple of days per week
At 16 a few days more, and I think only by 17 you can work full-time in Cyprus
School buses only exist in the big cities[1]
In towns (κωμόπολη to be exact) and villages, that's not done - or at least it wasn't done when I was a child
For the first few grades of primary school, my grandma would walk me there
Later, my mum got a car so she'd drive me
When I started secondary education, that was in the next village so there was a bus, but my mum would drive me to the bus stop because it was 10 minutes away from our house on foot
[1] It is actually humanly impossible to rely on public transport outside of Nicosia and Limassol
In Famagusta, the only lines that exist are to get old people to hospitals, labourers to factories, and ferry tourists between Protaras and Ayia Napa
Oh damn idk what village you’re from but in Vyzakia,potami,astromeriti,Evrychou,kakopetria,akaki etc there was a bus (after 2009 when Dhmotiko asinou was built)
In vyzakia, a bus picked us all up from our homes  while in nikitari and potami there was a bus stop every other house or 3
Now that the bus stop is 10 minutes away from my house for lykeio the bus that picks the students from the villages 20minutes away picks us up again then a different bus  takes us to evrychou but before when 2009 when villages has bigger population and their own schools the kids walked
OSEA only has 3 stops inside my entire village, and approximately 4 buses per day
There's no dedicated school bus for the primary schools inside the village - only that bus that would take us to the next village for middle school and high school
Yikes that’s a shame for such a tiny country our public transport system sucks so much
Yeah, the main problem is how they design the routes
They make no god-damn sense
Even Nicosia, which has the most robust bus network, has routes that are designed to force everyone to go through the Solomou Square Central Station in the city centre, even if they want to move laterally in the city
When I was working in Nicosia, I lived 15 minutes away from my job by bike
I would normally cycle there, but when it rained I would order a taxi
Taking the bus would mean travel in the opposite direction for 15 minutes, change bus at Solomou Sq
(god knows how much wait time) and travel for 25 more minutes in my proper direction
Secondarily, the geoinformation system sucks
The apps and websites are impossible to use, the data in the API (that is accidentally left open even though it's not public) is still not real time, there's no proper route planning, and they didn't even do the bare minimum and partner with Google Maps
Non-Greek speakers who come to Cyprus for their Erasmus baffle me, since with a few exceptions, instruction is in Greek
Then I realise there's a reason they always come for the spring semester and never the fall one
> not much going on
I dunno, a spend many a great nights in the town's only affordable restaurant, the Burger King in Iso myy xD
>a lot of English speaking courses
See, I kept finding it weird that people keep replying to me saying that, but I realised that maybe a lot of incoming Erasmus students go to our private universities
They probably have more English programmes than the public universities, but they are also irrelevant since they are different levels of diploma mills
Who can learn a foreign language in a few weeks before departing for the exchange at a sufficient level to follow academic topics though
I didn't go to an Erasmus exchange myself so I wouldn't waste teaching time, but if I would, it would be somewhere they teach in a language I already know
My alma mater states the following
> The language of teaching at the University is Greek
Most departments offer some courses in English
Other Departments may offer bibliography, assignments, tutorials and exams in English
Incoming students are advised to attend free of charge the Greek intensive courses offered during the year at the School of Modern Greek of the University
It's accurate, but it's up to the students to decide if they want to just scrape the bottom of the barrel for the one or two courses per year in English in the Department of e.g. Physics, or just spend their time doing Independent Study with a supervisor and not attend any lectures
Well, if that's what students want, there's nothing wrong with it
It would be, if the teaching is in a language I don't know at a good level
Yeah, you are probably right
I never looked into what other universities require because I never planned on going on an Erasmus exchange
My answer would be an “eh”. I don’t really desire unification of Cyprus
I’m fine as we are, and honestly don’t want things to become more complicated than they already are
If unification were to happen, how is it going to happen
It seems to me that federation “omospondia” as they call it, is the most popular “solution”. But the island would still be somewhat divided in that sense
Also what would happen to the Turkish Settlers
How will everything work
It seems complicated, and even if all Cypriots wanted this, I still think we wouldn’t be able to achieve it, especially if our old pal Turkey isn’t fond of it
Officially all Greek Cypriot parties want reunification and officially the 2 biggest parties want the same kind of solution, a "bi-zonal, bi-communal federation (BBF)" as proposed by the UN
This means that the Republic of Cyprus will be have a Turkish Cypriot side and a Greek Cypriot side where there will be some local autonomy when it comes to administration
Internationally however, the Republic of Cyprus will be one entity with one foreign policy
That's already a big concession for Greek Cypriots, even though that's what the major parties are advocating for in negotiations that's not the ideal solution for most Greek Cypriots
Prior to the invasion there wasn't a "North" and a "South" side, Greek and Turkish Cypriots lived in all areas of the island sometimes in separate villages , sometimes in mixed villages and sometimes in towns/cities (which were really small back then as most of the population was in rural areas) . When the invasion happen a forced population exchange led to many people losing their homes and their ancestors' land
So in a way splitting Cyprus in 2 sperate zones justifies the outcome of the invasion
That's why a unitary state solutions is preferred by most Greek Cypriots over a BFF
However Turkish Cypriots (/Turkey since in reality they are the ones who have the final say in this and not TCs) won't even negotiate for a Unitary State ,  Turkish nationalists want full-on partition of the island into 2 sperate states so BFF is what GC politicians are advocating for
So, the major political powers of GC already made the consession of negotiating for a BFF solution that's just the start of the problems
Greek Cypriots want properties taken by the Turkish army  (homes, land, shops ) to be given back to their rightful owners or for the owners to be compensated fairly
That's hard when a lot of them where given not to displaced TC from the south but to Turkish army soldiers or to illegal settlers from Turkey who are actively encouraged to come to Cyprus so that Turkey alters the area's demographics . Greek Cypriot want The illegal settlers to leave the island but that's also difficult to happen since now more than 40% of the population of the occupied areas is non-Cypriot
There are now more TC living outside of Cyprus than in Cyprus
Another major problem is the presence of Turkish troops on the island , GC want them to leave since we want an independent country
Turkey however wants to maintain presence on the island as it's location is a geopolitical advantage and TC might feel more secure .
The Cyprus problem for GC is a problem of an invasion and continued occupation of the island by Turkey, it's not an inter-communal problem and the solution to that problem is the liberation of the occupied areas
The term reunification can be misleading as it implies that the GC and TC were separated by their own which is not true .
Hello fans
I will talk you about both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, the Annan plan, the Gutteres Framework, the last negotiations in Crans Montana and much more
Greek Cypriots want reunification
But they won't accept any solution plan
All Greek Cypriot parties support reunification
A two state solution is considered treason
About the people
There are some that don't want two states
There are some who strongly support reunification
There are many that want reunification but don't want the proposed solution because according to them it's unfair
What is the proposed solution
Bi-communal Bi-zonal Federation
What is that
Keep reading
Generally speaking GCs want reunification but they have some red lines
I will explain to you what these are
"If you say they want reunification, why did GCs said NO to the Annan plan

Since you all waited for so long last night I mention you so you can see my answers
If you have any questions let me know
If this is too long again let me know
I have been waiting for a question like this lol
I am a greek speaking cypriot
The GC side from experience is the one least willing for reunification
The in my opinion false ideology that the Turks"walked in our houses and killed everyone and took half our country" is one very common between GC and I believe it is because that is what we were taught
Only part of the story
For decades the church has been controlling cyprus , influencing it greatly
this involved education
All though that seems to be in a smaller scale nowadays, it's still there
The TC community seems much more willing for reunification
The people remember a time when they used to live together with GC
Most of the Turkish cypriots if not all used to speak fluent greek
so long story short, GC citizens overall do not support reunification of the island, whereas TC citizens want reunification
Cyprus has a very long and delicate history so I am unable to explain it all over a comment
It's a very beautiful and interesting history that is sadly hidden even from its people
i urge you to explore it
But regarding the question, it's all so messed up right now
Too many mixed opinions and beliefs
I'm speaking about what I think the vague image looks like
*Disclaimer:*
* *left Cyprus 7 years ago, I spend around 2 months each year in Cyprus and have daily communication with family*
* *left-leaning, pro-unification*
* *Greek-speaking Cypriot (GSC)*
* *Age: late 20's*
Not just met, but I have friends that are Turkish-speaking Cypriots (TSC)
The things we have in common are way more than food and words and personal aspirations
The mentality is very similar
The Cypriot problem is a simple one to understand, yet very complicated to solve
Having said that, we must realise that it is not a social issue, it's a political one
Let's dive in a little deeper and let me paint you an image of the *reality*:
**Republic of Cyprus:**
* Internationally recognised
* Part of the European Union
* *normal* country
**TRNC:**
* Not recognised, besides Turkey
* Dependent on Turkey (in all aspects)
The division of the island was done in 1974, that's 46 years ago
Both after-war populations grew up in a nationalistic (under the facade of *patriotism*) educational system and with virtually no contact with each other
Also, the younger population (16-30) is very apolitical
The "borders" opened in 2003, so there is a new generation growing up with this normality
This generation can visit the other side anytime they want as "tourists" for a day
Here, I must mention that according to the Cypriot Constitution of 1959, all Cypriots are citizens of the Republic of Cyprus (RoC) and as such can freely move, work and vote
In reality, however, TSCs are full citizens of RoC but GSC not of "TRNC". While in theory, the TSCs could move to the more developed South (very few TSCs live in the South) the social implications are such that they make that a rather difficult reality
* The TSCs have more to gain from a unification but they are already the minority in the North and the influence of Turkey is so strong that basically there is no will
Since the opening of the "borders", TSCs have applied and gotten Cypriot passport and as such are EU citizens
And subsequently, this has diminished the "need" for international recognition
In the North, there are hundreds of thousands of Turks that were brought to Cyprus after the war and of course many who were born here
Their connection with the land is less emotional
* The GSCs are fine as it is
Yes, they'd love to get back their properties (I doubt any of them would move back in) but it's more of a romantic dream
The financial benefits of unification are huge (in the long term)
The market will almost double, access to Turkey's immense market (both for imports and exports) and it paves the way for the peaceful exploration of hydrocarbons found in Cyprus
There are politicians on both sides (especially on the right) that have built their whole career on the issue, solving it leaves them basically without a cause
**TL;DR** Unification is worth it, but very unlikely (for the moment)
Well, it is an occupation
I will send you some TCs friends
Are GCs in favour of reunification
I answered last night about that
Generally speaking GCs are in favour of reunification and they are against parition
Unitary state is the most popular model for GCs but the GC side accepted the turkish thesis of federation as a compromise so we can achieve reunification and liberation
The acceptance of Bi-Communal Bi-Zonal Federation is considered a painful compromise in order to achieve a solution
The two biggest parties(rightist & leftist) agree with BBF
The centrist parties accept federation but are not willing to "give" as many things as the other two parties
The socialist-democratic party disagrees with BBF because it's racist
The nationalistic party is against any form of federation and openly supports the unitary state
Most GCs don't know or understand BBF
They want reunification but they won't accept any solution plan
&#x200B;
Are TCs against reunification
I don't think so
The majority of TCs would vote in favour of both reunification and permanent division
Unlike GCs parties that are all against a two state solution, the rightist TC parties no longer support the UN agreed model of solution and support either a two state solution or a confederation of two states
The leftist parties still support reunification
&#x200B;
The current leader of the Turkish Cypriot Community, Mr Mustafa Akinci, supports reunification as a Bi-Communal Bi-zonal Federation with political equality as described in the relevant UN resolutions
In a few months a voting will be held and the new leader of the Turkish Cypriot Community will be chosen
The main canditates are Akinci(pro-reunification), Tatar(against reunification, supports two state solution), Erhurman(pro-reunification), Ozersay (pro-confederation/two-states)
Btw I'm talking about the people not the parties  ^^
We agree:)
Oh I don’t mind
This is from my point of view
I’m Greek Cypriot, though I don’t think that’s how most Greek Cypriots view the situation
Many want unification, which I view as somewhat “romantics”. It seems that many are sceptical and really neutral/don’t know what to think about it
It’s something strange, and especially since we have been divided enough, I think many people are just “ok” with the current situation
Edit:
Ps I’m 16, so bare in mind like most of my age, I have never met a Turkish Cypriot and never lived on a Cyprus that’s “one”.
What about erdogan refusing the withdrawal of Turkish troops
Also recent drillings on our EEZ ain’t doing any good
We will get to an analysis on the Annan plan tomorrow morning
**Bi-communal Bi-zonal Federation**
&#x200B;
It was agreed in 1977 that the solution to the cypriot problem would be achieved bi negotiations under the umbrella of the United Nations and United Cyprus would be a Bi-Communal Bi-zonal Federation
From now on we call it BBF
&#x200B;
So what BBF
&#x200B;
There is no such a thing as BBF in the world
The closer examples we have is Bosnia-Herzegovina and Belgium
&#x200B;
But again what does it mean
&#x200B;
**Bi-communality**
It means that the state will have two communities
The Republic of Cyprus is a Bi-Communal State
Bi-communality has some characteristics
Separate elections
GCs vote for GCs, TCs vote for TCs, two official languages
Parliament is divided based on the community
(the ratio is 30% TCs even though the population was 18%)
One GC president, one TC vicepresident
Pretty much everything is divided in two
&#x200B;
**Bi-zonality**
This used to have a different (even worse) meaning but now it basically means that United Cyprus will have two zones
One governed by Turkish Cypriots and one governed by Greek Cypriots
These two will be the states/provinces/cantons(call them what you want) of the federation and these two will be equals
&#x200B;
**Federation**
It will be a federation
The federation will have two Parliaments
A president and a vice-president
A central government
A Council of Ministers appointed by the presidents
&#x200B;
I will get a bit deeper on things that are and aren't agreed
Have in mind that in all negotiations are based on the principle that "nothing is agreed until
everything is agreed".
&#x200B;
So the two communities agree that United Cyprus will be a Bi-Communal Bi-zonal Federation with political equality as described in the UN resolutions
United Cyprus shall have a single international legal personality and a single sovereignty, a single citizenship
&#x200B;
The President of the Republic of Cyprus is the negotiator of the Greek Cypriot Community
International Community recognise the leader of the Turkish Cypriot Community as the negotiator and representative of the Turkish Cypriot community in the international community
"TRNC officials" are not considered representatives of the TC community
&#x200B;
In 2017, in Crans Montana there was an International Conference for the Cypriot problem
The two communities and the three guarantor powers of the Republic of Cyprus participated
(we are not sure if the Republic of Cyprus was also a participant)
&#x200B;
The talks failed but I am not gonna get into what happened and why
I will instead focus on the most important part
What are the agreements and the disagreements
In order to do do that I will present the Gutteres Framework
**The Gutteres Framework includes the six main aspects of the Cypriot problem:**
**- Security - Guarantees**
**- Foreign Troops**
**- Equal Treatment of Turkish Nationals**
**- Territory**
**- Power sharing**
**- Properties**
The Gutteres Framework is framework made by the the UN General Secretary that divides the cypriot problem in these section and give a basis on the basic principles about each section
Both sides accepted the Gutteress framework but they did so a few months after the talks failed
Sadly each side accept a different "version" of that framework
The UN didn't bother on publishing such an important document
I think the most important part of my text is to show you what each side supports in each one of these sections
I will explain in-depth each one of these 6 chapters
Before I get into that I have to tell you that the leaders of the Cypriot communities were present in the negotiations of all sections
Greece, Turkey and UK were present in the negotiations about the external chapters of the Cypriot problem, Security-Guarantees and Foreign Army
Lol ok thanks
>Turkish and Greek Cypriots should do the unification agreement with approval of Greece and Turkey
No we shouldn't have to , that's the problem
Cypriots should be able to decide their fate alone, Greece and Turkey should stay out of this . Greece already has accepted to support any plan that the GC agree with , the same cannot be said about Turkey , who is the main negotiator instead of TC
The difference between Turkey and Greece is that Greece does not have any political control over Cyprus and they are not forcing GC to do what they want
**Equivalent treatment of Turkish Nationals**
Turkish nationals(ppl from Turkey) want to have the same  treatment as people drom Greece(ofc Greek nationals ahave the treatment of any other EU national)
What does the Gutteres Framework say
Free movement of goods ( =customs union + a quota to be agreed for primary agricultural products), services and capital are ok
Free movement of persons: the regime will permit tourists, students and seasonal workers
For those seeking permanent residence, Turkish nationals should have a quota that is equitable and further discussion is needed on what ‘equitable’ means
GC side agrees on that but only with a ratio 4:1 (Greek Nationals:Turkish Nationals)The agreed population ratio between GCs and TCs is 4:1 so that way neither Greeks nor Turks will affect the demographics of the island
**Power-sharing**
&#x200B;
So this is a main topic that was being discuss a lot after the failure in Crans Montana
As we said before United Cyprus will be a BBF with political equality of the two communities
As I said before Republic of Cyprus is a Bi-Communal state with two politically equal communities
&#x200B;
Political equality is reflected in many things
Here are some things agreed for United Cyprus:
&#x200B;
30% of the Lower Parliament will be TCs
50% of the High Parliament will be TCs
Cyprus will have one president and one vice-president
(sth abut the Courts-sry I don't know much)
Special majorities will be needed for changing the Constitution and some other important stuff
The Council of Ministry will have 4 TCs and 7 GCs ministers
30% of jobs in the federal public sector will be TCs
40%(-if I am not mistaken-of the federal police will be TCs)
&#x200B;
The above are pretty much agreed
There are two points about political equality that there are major disagreements
These are:
\- positive vote
\- rotating presidency
&#x200B;
**Positive vote:** For any decision made by the Federal Government a positive Turkish Cypriot vote is needed
(so if all GCs in the Lower Parliament<the High Parliament has 50% representation of each community so a TC is needed there anyway> vote in favour of sth if no TC vote for it the decision can't be made)
&#x200B;
**Rotating Presidency:** President and vicepresident in the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus are voted separately by each  community
Originally the GC president should be voted by GCs and the TC vicepresident should be voted by TCs
TCs want rotating presidency
Every two terms od GC president and TC vice president they want a TC president and a GC vicepresident
&#x200B;
GC side: They accept the positive vote in the Council of Ministers and in wvwry decision that would affect the vital interests of the TC community or zone
People don't really like the idea of their president being a TC (or even worse a Turk) because he won't represent the majority of the people
The GC side would accept rotating presidency if  the TC
side agree on the security/troops sections in a formula that was agreed 10 ywars ago during negotiations
the formula says that both President and vicepresident are voted by all Cypriots
If this term will have a TC the president and GC vicepresident 80% of the result will come from the community of each candidate (so 80% of the percentage for the president wpuld come from TCs voted and 20% from GCs votes
Same for the GC vicepresident-80% from GCs and 20% TCs)
That way both of the presidents will try to convince people from both communities
The main problem woth this is that sinc eGV population is much higher than the TC population a vote of a TC will count as much as 6(just an example) votes of GCs
Only two GC parties accept rotating presidency as a trade ofd
The rest(central parties and nationalistic are against)
&#x200B;
TC side: They want the positive vote in every decision made in the central government
They want rotating presidency in a ratio of 2:1
(They alsp accept that formula)
&#x200B;
What does the Gutteres Framework say
&#x200B;
According to GCs
The issue of power sharing should be discussed further in relation to the issue of a  positive vote, namely when and under what conditions and in which bodies  this could be exercised, with concurrent provisions for mechanisms to  resolve issues that have reached deadlock
Other elements, such as the rotating presidency, are issues  that need to be discussed as requested by the Turkish Cypriot side (on a  2:1 ratio)
&#x200B;
According to TCs
Rotating Presidency with 2:1 ratio
Decision-making (effective participation): simple majority with one positive vote with deadlock resolving mechanism/ in cases where issues are of vital interest for the communities
&#x200B;
As you see the according to the TC side these two are not part of the negotiations and are already agreed by both sides
GC side will agree on rotating presidency but only if they get sth in return(Morphou/Guarantess-Troops)
&#x200B;
This section is probably the most important section for TCs
**Security - Guarantees**
&#x200B;
For you to understand what these are we have to to back in 1960 when the Republic of Cyprus was created
*The Republic of Cyprus had three fundamental treaties
A short summary for two of those:*
&#x200B;
*Treaty of Alliance: Greece and Turkey want peace in the island
In order to achieve that Greece has 950 Greek soldiers stationed in the island and Turkey has 650  soldiers stations in the island
(Greece has more because GCs were more)*
&#x200B;
*Treaty of Guarantee: UK, Turkey and Greece are guarantor powers of the RoC
The Treaty gave the right(and duty) to the three guarantor powers to military intervene in case of emergency in order to protect the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and restore the RoC to its former status
&#x200B;
*In 1974 GC nationalists with the help of greek junta(dictatorship in Greece) -and the help of CIA- committed a coup against the legal President of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios III(he managed to escape)
Turkey used that Treaty to justify the first invasion in 1974 after a coup
Turkey got 3% of the island and those who tried to kill Makarios lost power
Turkey instead of restoring the RoC to its former state and leave made a second invasion and took control of 36,7% of the island(violating the Treaty of Guarantee)*
&#x200B;
Greek Cypriot side wants the abolishment of the Treaty of Guarantee
They don't want Turkey to have the right to invade
Instead of that, GC side proposes a system that involved the United Nations and the European Union so all Cypriots can feel safe
&#x200B;
Turkish Cypriot side is more divided on that
The TC right doesn't accept for reason a United Cyprus without Turkish guarantees(they also don't support United Cyrus but okay)
The TC left are a bit more
positive of the replacement of current Treaty of Guarantees but it's not really their choice
&#x200B;
Turkey said multiple times-Erdogan+Cavusoglu- (publicly) that those who dream of no guarantees are just dreaming
&#x200B;
Greece supports what GC side says
&#x200B;
UK said they agree on the abolishment of the guarantees as long as both communities agree
What does the Gutteres Framework say about this
&#x200B;
According to TCs
It asserts that both communities should feel safe in a federal Cyprus, and that the security of one should not come at the detriment of the other
The framework outlines that a system in which the right of intervention remains would not be sustainable; and that the Treaty of Guarantees could be replaced by adequate implementation monitoring mechanisms, where Guarantor Powers could partly be involved
The framework states that issues related to troops (numbers, withdrawals if and when they will need to leave, timelines, etc
) will be agreed at the prime ministerial level of guarantor countries
According to GCs
\* We must begin to recognize that in Cyprus we need a new security system and not a continuation of the existing one
\* I believe we must end the right to intervene and the Treaty of Guarantee
\* They need to be replaced by a new system in which all Cypriots would feel safe
\* We need a fast implementation mechanism, which includes external features such as the United Nations, and multilateral and international aspects
Today’s guarantors may not implement and supervise themselves
&#x200B;
Security-Guarantees is one of the two most important sections of the cypriot problem for Greek Cypriots
**Foreign Troops**
&#x200B;
Even though the title says foreign troops it's mostly the 30
000 Turkish soldiers stationed in Cyprus
GC side wants the turkish army to leave the island under an agreed timetable(sth similar happened in East Germany)
The final foal is the demitarization of Cyprus
TC side wants the turkish army to stay and live after a couple of years and a part of it to stay forever
(sth like what Annan plan: rhe majority pf the Turkish army would leave after 14 years or sth)
A part of TC community isnokay with the withdrawal of the Turkish army I think(better ask a TC on that)
&#x200B;
Turkey: the above\^
Greece: Agrees with GCs side
&#x200B;
What does the Gutteres Framework says
&#x200B;
According to GCs
\* There should be a rapid reduction from the first day, gradually decreasing within an agreed timetable to numbers that would be in line with the old Treaty of Alliance
(950 Greek, 650 Turkish)
\* Guterres’ framework says there is disagreement between the parties as to whether there will be a termination (sunset) or review clause
Furthermore, he noted that further discussion was needed on the details of withdrawal
&#x200B;
According to TCs
The issue of troops is a different question relative to the Treaty of Guarantees, and to be handled in a different format
Issues related to troops (numbers, withdrawals if and when they will need to leave, timelines, etc
) to be agreed at the highest level when time is ripe
&#x200B;
This is one of the two most important sections for GCs
**Property**
&#x200B;
In 1974 after the Turkish invasion the 1/3 of thr GC population became refugees, lost their homes and properties
TCs also had to leave their houses in the south after the Turkish invasion
TCs are regarded as legal owners of their properties in the southern part of the island
On the other hand GCs refugees are considered people that abandoned their properties and have no right on them
Turkey brought people from Turkey after 1974 and many of these people were given properties of GCs refugees
GCs want to get back their properties and return to their houses
&#x200B;
GC side supports that all the refugees should be able to return to their home and het back their properties
TC side supports that the "users" that have GC properties should not have not abandon the houses and properties of GCs and isyead be considered as owners of these properties
&#x200B;
The two sides agreed on these:
(that's what the Gutteres Framework says)
Two property regimes:
\* In  areas that will be returned to Greek Cypriot administration there must  be agreed criteria so the rightful owner will have preferential  treatment but not 100 per cent
\* In areas that would remain under Turkish  Cypriot administration preferential treatment should be given to  current users, but not 100 per cent
&#x200B;
The goal of GC side is that 100
000 refugees can return
&#x200B;
It was accepted by the GC side but many GC political parties disagree with giving the "user"("thief") more rights than the legal owner
It was accepted by the TC side (but again rightist TC political parties disagree with the return of GC refugees in their houses and any population transfer)
**Territory**
&#x200B;
Turkey currently occupies 36,7% of the island
As we said the solution is BBF
Bi-zonal: 2 zones
It is agreed that a part of the area currently occupied will be returned to the GCs and will be part of the GC zone
The agreed percentage of the TC zone is between 28,5-29,5%
&#x200B;
GC side wants the return of Famagusta City (Varosha, the Ghost town rhat is under the control of turkish army), the return of some other areas and the return of Morphou(used to be inhabited only by GCs)
GC side also wants that the GC zone will have at least 50% of the coastline
TC side doesn't really want the return of Morphou
At Crans Montana Conference both sides submitted a map
&#x200B;
What the Gutteres Framework says
"The TC side needs to adjust the map presented by the TCs to respond to concerns expressed by GCs regarding some locations"(of what we understand it's a reference to Morphou)
&#x200B;
I think territory is not a main disagreement
Τhe referendum is a referendum for the Turkish Cypriot community not for the "TRNC"
The international community doesn't acknowledge the existence of another state in Cyprus (that's why the only representative of TCs is Mr Akinci as the leaser of the TC community because he is directly elected by TCs and Mr Tatar can't represent TCs abroad
So the referendum will determine the future of the TC community (the one of the two communities of the legal state, RoC)
Ofc the referendum will determine the future of "TRNC* because it will cease to exist even for TCs
Cypriot Greek is still diverse enough so that people can tell if you are from a specific district, but there's definitely a process called 'dialect levelling' going on
Especially after the immense population displacement caused by the war in 1974, but also urbanisation in the 80s onwards, mean that the different regional dialects are starting to be more similar
We have two dialects
Cypriot dialect of Greek and Cypriot dialect of Turkish
Nowadays cypriot greek is the only dialect of greek except the official one that is commonly spoken by a lot of people . Greek used to have a lot of dialects but they have slowly died mostly because of an increase in literacy
Cypriot greek itself is much closer to standard greek than how it was 100 years ago
People used to be mocked for using a lot of words from the dialect and it was ( and still is) what we call "village-y" which is associated with the uneducated villager stereotype that existed more than 50 years ago
There also used to be different dialect from village to village but because of urbanisation now there are only slight differences from region to region .
These are some of the Greek dialects
The rest are dying/dead, either because of Standard Greek popularity, or because of the Greek genocide
I am from Nicosia and I went to Pa(ph)os, where I couldn’t understand them easy
Édit: i realised that I misused the word based, so I deleted it
That’s about minority languages, not dialects
I think the dialect of Nicosia is the closest own to standard Greek
And Paphos as the most isolated district has preserved more it's dialect .
Indeed
> I think the dialect of Nicosia is the closest own to standard Greek
I think a lot of it is perception, rather than reality
For example, I have a Nicosian friend who insists he says "σίγουρα" (and similar for other  γ-between-vowels words)
He doesn't, he says σίουρα" like everyone else
But he doesn't hear it
Yes but that’s not always the case
There’s a slight difference
A minority language in a country might not be a dialect
in some cases it could
I do however agree that some answers are interchangeable
The Greek government did the Junta but everyone blames us Greek Cypriots
Calling it a  border is politically controversial since there is mutual non-recognition of sovereignty, but:
* [Nicosia/Lefkosia/Lefkoşa]
* [Deryneia/Derinya]
* [Pyla/Pile]
* [Louroujina/Lurucina/Akıncılar]
are some of the prominent ones
Of them, Pyla was the one that most operated as a unified town, and sort of like a tri-point between south Cyprus, north Cyprus, and the UK
Nicosia had three police checkpoints that allowed movement between the two halves and could sort-of feel like it's not totally disconnected
Deryneia only recently gained a police checkpoint
Now all of them are closed indefinitely due to the coronavirus outbreak
Louroujina didn't have an official border crossing, some communication was done by traversing the DMZ without a permit
In greek there is a song about Mousolini that also says some stuff related to Italy
I really wanted to visit Istanbul and Edirne this year; but unfortunately that's been placed on hold
The last time I was in Turkey was 2004 and I'd definitely like to see it again
Plus cheap food and tea can never hurt
Usually it’s pretty much between Greece/Turkey or Russia if the former are not playing
Malta, Greece, Italy, Armenia, Lebanon
Is your ancestral homeland really in central asia
Well wouldn't you say that your ancestors are primarily Anatolian and your culture while having traits of some Turkic traditions, is primarily Anatolian, Middle eastern and Balkan shared across the region
You don't see an american calling themselves swedish because they have 7% swedish DNA
Most of your ancestors basically originate from proto-anatolians (for an average Turkish person, I do know that there are some villages that do show high amounts of Turkic ancestry) so why do Turks ignore their Anatolian roots and act like they are actually Turkic
The Turkish tribes that did arrive in Anatolia were mixed up with Persians in the first place too
My opinion is that Turkish identify was created to unite people of Anatolia under the same banner and nation since the term Turk was not used by Ottomans to refer themselves instead it was kind of an insult to call some one Turk
After the adoption of Turkic Identity Turkey was created those who were not "Turks" driven out (the ones that did not convert to islam)
You can see the differences that people from different parts of Turkey have it is still a multi-ethnic country united under the Turkish identity
As for my self I don't indentify as either, in Cyprus the issue is mainly caused by religion and not people choosing and identity, identities being created by minority extremist groups in Cypriot Turks case the grey wolfs etc
Yes of course people can identify as something they are genetically not part of, but the line between that usually gets lost people lose their original roots which can make cultures disappear and people don't choose as individuals what to identify as
A group in power of the region identifies as that and enforces it on others by means of propaganda and  etc this is what exactly happened in Cyprus
After and deal was arranged with UK, Turkish teachers arrived to teach locals proper Turkish and replaced the village names with Turkish names, for example morphou became guzelyurt
Anyway what I am saying is whrn the identification is natural its okay, but not when its enforced by others other countries trying to change our identities for their own gains
Turkey
Heh Do I have to say, its still on-going actually
Surprise, surprise it's the Turks
and it would be for the second time
(My country is Cyprus)
Turkey
Its still going on
Sadly
yes it is
"or anyone else in the EU " U sure
Its still going on
It's culturally being invaded as of right now politicians are controlled, TCs are already a minority in their own de facto state, soon it might even be annexed by Turkey
[σκονάκι] <skonáki>, which apparently literally meant a small dose of medicine or drug in powder form - I never heard it used literally though
You are not wrong, it is a composition of the word for "dust" and the suffix for "little" but according to the dictionary entry, that dust was specifically a drug in powder form
It must be a very old sense (back when you could get cocaine prescriptions for coughing, I guess), I only ever heard it being used for cheat sheets
Oh wow, that's a great citation, so the old sense was at least still familiar in the 80s. It's a shame we don't have sufficiently large databases for the Greek language to investigate when the modern sense of the word was first used
I have a [Greek source] (short scale, unofficial publicatiton) and a [Cypriot source] (long scale, official publication) and they disagree
This has annoyed me, I don't know which one I am familiar with after all because I never really deal with big numbers, and I gave up
Just write out the numbers in full digits or scientific notation
EDIT: I am asking Greek speakers [here] More I think about it, the more it seems like I would read (1000) (000 000) as a thousand million and not one billion
EDIT: It looks like a billion is 10^9 in Greece, but 10^12 in Greek as spoken in Cyprus
Greece is the one that uses the American (and now British) scale though
It looks like Cyprus is using the European scale
Divided
And hot
Also slow internet
So east that it’s debatable if it’s actually in Europe*
Agreed
Bye is the normal in Cyprus(since you have to enter and exit at the back)
In Greece I rarely use the front door so I don't tell him sth
Unfortunately this problem goes much deeper than one company's policies .
There was a post about this a few days ago
I love the shapes of Switzerland, Ireland, Greece, Germany and UK
I love Crete's shape as well:)
(I like the shape of my country too but I wont brag :)
I like how l’hexagone looks
No worries
Well the border of Cyprus(being in island) is pretty unique and cool:)
Maybe the Turkish Cypriot that created the cypriot flag also loved our cool shape:)
Well ...in a way:)
Never thought of that(literally never)
I see creatures in: France, Germany and UK
Cmon man the shape is great:)
It's hard to explain:(
As a kid I was a big fan of pokemons(and I loved drawing) in my imagination some of these countries look like creatures
Great Britain is a really proud one
I still see them the way I saw them as a kid:D
(If I keep talking you will think I am crazy so I ll just stop xD)
It's hard to explain
That wouldn't be the first time where Turkey invades another country and occupies it .
Yes to a significant extent, but I have both formal training in English linguistics and informal familiarity with a number of non-native accents
Still, I think most Cypriots are at least able to distinguish native and non-native English speakers, even if they can't guess what the person's native language actually is
Paphos
Definitely paphos
Most of the time you don't know what they're saying, they have weird ethics and traditions
It's like they're not even part of the country
This is some kualiti [grik miusik]
*The language is 100% grik
(Jk it’s a bunch of incomprehensible sounds,  half of which are in English)
I truly apologise for those who suffered listening to this
I can feel you

To the most part that’s true, and sad
I'm willing to bet gay kids move out earlier than their straight peers even in the European south
EDIT: [might as well ask]
Mixed feelings
Epic
Just
Epic
Firstly, the anthem of Cyprus is the same as the one of Greece, making it the only anthem in the world to be shared between 2 countries
It basically says that the Greeks are almighty and we finally became free from the long slavery we had
I praise it brcause it gave the country hope in so many occasions, such as: WW1, WW2, Balkan Wars, Cypriot war if independence, overthrowing the Junta in 1974 etc
It is the single biggest inspiration ti Greece and Cyprus
That's interesting
In Cyprus we drive the same way British do
I have no answer for you though, I ll try to observe that
I personally walk on the left
Υeah it's one pf the thingd the Crown left to the island (some other things were UK plugs, a constitution, military bases)
Europe is not a single country to have a price law across the board
Not even the EU works like that
In Cyprus, currently the price for PPE is subject to an [upper limit] set by MinHealth decrees
A pack of 50 plain single-use surgical masks shouldn't be sold for over 10 EUR
(EDIT: ok, that table is old, from March
[Currently] the cap is at 35 EUR for 50 pcs)
I hear complaints about the enforcement though
Smart law
Greece used to have it, they got rid of it and it was a disaster
Afaik, Cyprus never had it, and we also don't have bookstores, we have stationary shops that call themselves bookshops
Distributors and retailers who couldn't keep up with demand, especially back when the supply chain was stretched thin
That may be the reason the cap was raised
But what I mentioned is complaints about the *poor* enforcement of the price cap
People are calling in radio shows to complain about shops selling PPE for higher prices than the ones listed in the decree
But now I am wondering if they, like me, didn't keep up with the decrees, and expected March prices in August
English has it complications of course, and those are different depending on which languages you already know (e.g. I think that OP, coming from Spain, would agree with me that English has a complicated vowel system, but that is probably not a concern for someone who speaks, say, Danish)
&#x200B;
What really makes a difference is how widely used English is
As learners, we are more motivated and get more opportunities to use English, and that really makes it easier
It's true, Finnish has what we call in the biz a ["shallow orthography"] On the other hand, written Finnish and spoken Finnish are essentially different dialects so, as a learner, I was taught the same things twice
The difference between written English and spoken English is considerably smaller (I'm actually having trouble thinking of differences between spoken and written English
Maybe the use of "whom" and avoidance of contractions
The modern Greek word ("Ellada") is the same but the "H" is dropped and the suffix is different for grammatical reasons
Hi, wanna talk to me
But what about N. Irish ppl
Nice to meet you:)
No cursive in Greek-speaking schools at least since the Greek junta fell, and I hate everyone in Europe who forces me to read cursive :/
Edit: "forcing me to read" may be overstating things
I can't even read it
Disgusting, but I may be mildly allergic because I always had to leave the room whenever I could smell almost any seafood
No no no no non noo noooo
When I was younger I wanted to move to the USA , then I started watching US news ...
Being shot is my immediate concern
Greece - Ελλάδα (Hellada)
Switzerland - Ελβετία (Helvetia)
France- - Γαλλία (Gallia)
Ολλανδία (Ollandhia) -> Netherlands
Κάτω Χώρες (Kato Khores, ie Low Lands) -> BeNeLux
Also others like
Denmark= Δανία (danía)
Ivory coast=  ακτή του Ελεφαντοστού (akti tu    elefantostu) which is a literal translation of the name in greek
Netherlands- Κάτω χώρες
Are you sure
Isn't Kato Khores just the Netherlands
Interestingly Yunanistan is Lands of Yunans/Ionians which was one of the Greek tribes in the islands
Cool
Oh wow didn't know that:)
Yeah
I supposed Denmark and Dania have the same root that's why I skipped it
>  like a tropical archipelago
I mean, give it 20 years
It's used to mean just the Netherlands in European Union documents in Greek (since they have a strict style guide), and eventually that usage may become universal (as a formal alternative to Ollandhia, like Anglia-Inomeno Vasilio, Ameriki-Inomenes Polities)
So is Kato Khores BeNeLux or Netherlands
Yeah a Turkish Cypriot told me that as well which is also very interesting
In non-EU documents usage, BeNeLux
Yes, it's the direct equivalent of Low Countries
May i ask were you born there or did u choose to move

Its funny how the actions of Nazi Germany are looked as they are incredibly inhumane and disgusting, while the 2 nukes dropped on Japan by the USA are overlooked
Yes, i want to kill myself more
really tho
whenever i speak english my thoughts become more suicidal
maybe it's because i have an actual english accent like it's straight outta
i don't wanna say London, more southern
Hmm
I think Athens is prettier (mainly because of the ancients)
Haha thanks
I’d like to go to Stockholm one day
Well, there’s also Plaka
Ich bin das fahrrad
Yes
We already call it Czechia in Greek (Τσεχία), so no change for us :)
In Greek it's Τσεχία so it's pretty much the same
I am not used to it yet though
In the dictionaries, there's a difference between ζήλια (jealousy) and φθόνος (envy), but most of the time we use ζήλια for both
Φθόνος is archaic and tends to only be used in more formal registers
I don't have that distinction, and in my life I've heard ζήλια used for both "active" (κάμνει το που ζήλεια) and "passive" (ζηλέφκει που...) desire
What you describe may be a new development happening specifically in Greece
It's still not picked up by ΛΚΝ Τριανταφυλλίδη so it's maybe something of the last two decades
In any case, the nuance I have for both words is that they describe a negative state
I'd say something positive in that case, like ίντα καλά (how nice), or μακάρι να 'μουν τζι εγιώ (I wish I was too)
The most positive spin I can give to ζηλέφκω σου is that of a complaint, I may not really hate you for being on a better situation than me, but I am still miserable about mine and I want to mention it
But that's still passive
It looks like a regional difference
> Russian is similar in its entire country
[\[dubious claim\]]

Wasn’t there a Bloody Sunday in Russia too
Yes, I know about it
I’m currently studying Russian history
I have a test on Wednesday on the Bolshevik takeover
We don't have trains
It's actually growing pretty fast
We had our first actual meme last year with "posibol"
Some guy was asked about the actor of the main character of the movie Mission Impossible and he didn't know english and just said "Possibol"
It's Τριβίλλουρα, no idea how to explain it, idk
3-dicks xD
When my grandpa brings fresh eggs he never puts them in the fridge
When I buy eggs I just out them in the fridge
Fresh milk is always in the fridge
Right now I have two keyboards in use
My laptop has what Lenovo calls "English - European", which is basically the US English [ANSI layout] but with the Right Alt being labelled Alt Gr
My external keyboard is the [typical Greek-English keyboard] which is derived from the US English QWERTY but in addition to the introduction of Alt Gr where Right Alt is, it has the two-storey Enter key (like [ISO] does), and has the € symbol on the third level of the key for 'ε'.
(Ex-) IBM desktop computers in Cyprus sometimes came with a Greek-English keyboard derived from the [UK English QWERTY ISO] Absolutely dreadful
The punctuation between UK English and Greek has no correspondence at all
A decent ISO Greek-English keyboard would have parallel labelling but it would look extremely busy because there's near-zero overlap
But you mind end up with a keyboard only listing UK English punctuation, or computers with the wrong layout set in software
QWERTY but because we have 2 less letters than the Latin Alphabet, the Q and the w are replaced by the Greek Question mark which is also the English semi-colon ";" and thr W is replaced with the ς, s that is usrd at the end of words (this letter is luterally only used at the end of words, but it's common because many words end in s)
I wouldn’t associate skin colour with health
That’s stupid
Every single little village has an accent
And we just make fun of them all the time
Eg, Nicosia is posh af, not even Cypriot, just Greek, more Greek than Greece itself, Liopetri just speaks anti-spanish, where every θ soynd is χ and Paphos
We just joke that Paphos should be its own country because of their accent
'Cyprus' is fine
Maybe change a to y. I think the pronunciation of  y  in most languages is closer to â than a is .
Yeah but changing its name in English to be its name in Greek would trigger Turkish Cypriots
Greece
Until I saw how ugly they let their country get
Germany
Don’t get me wrong, Merkel’s done a great job with the country itself, I just don’t like how she took the Union out of the whole EU thing
Well, no
Having an international language allows for a more globalised and connected world, through better and easier communication
I just don’t like the over use of it, especially by natives if other languages
For example I’m really annoyed when people while speaking Greek use a bunch of English words in there, that’s even more annoying when the word they use has a Greek origin
No, since I consider English to be as much our language as it is the UK's.
Omg both Cypriot and Greek TV is trash
I stopped watching altogether
> Cyprus: Does their really low quality soap operas count
(Greek soap operas are not much better either anyway)
lol
Ummm no
That's not true
You are probably refering to the intercommunal violence that started way before the invasion
But keep in mind that both communities commited atrocities
Turkey have always wanted to annex Cyprus and it found the opportunity when Greece staged a coup to overthrow the Cypriot President
I don't deny that atrocities were committed
But your comment is biased and one sided ignoring the complexity of the problem
There wasn't a systematic plan to ethnically cleanse the island as some Turks claim
And Turks always seem to omit the fact that they invaded Cyprus in order to protect The Turkish Cypriots but you ended up staying forever and started sending illegal settlers to the island
Edit: grammar
I didn't expect you to explain the situation fully
But when they asked you why, your answer was sort of deductive and biased
That's not a question about Turkey and Cyprus indeed
But I couldn't simply not reply to one-sided arguments
As I said both sides have made errors
I am not claiming that Greeks are inoccent
And this is of course a debate for an another question not this one
If I am not mistaken I recently read somewhere that there are 2,000 approximately Cypriot Turkish Language speakers living in the Republic so yeah technically they are a minority even tough  Turkish is an official language of the Republic
Yes indeed
Also, note that this MEP was elected by the Greek Cypriots
It's one of the four seats of the Greek community
So this is a good step towards a solution
It also shows that the Greek Cypriots are ready and willing for it
Ok that was a bit irrelevant to the original question but since it came up I mentioned it
It was on tv yesterday (in Greece)
In Cyprus it might be on tv this weekend or on Christmas Eve
Fellahs (Uneducated Turkish settlers that were illegaly placed in peoples homes in order to turkify the occupied land
At that point, we either listened to THAT, or modern greek music
Y'know, the ones they play with the fuckin Bouzouki in the background alongside a violin for some reason and singing like a half mad drunk person
It's also close and kind of recreating the early modern Greek music near the 1850s, but putting a more Western style/lyrics into it
Like hadjidakis and Theodorakis
Wouldn’t Rempetika be popular
Kati tethkio
As you can tell, I'm not very fond of it, but I know it happened then
Sure, but isn't rempetika older
Like 30s or 20s or something
Y tho
I love Theodorakis and Hadjidakis
They are amongst Greece’s greatest composers
They used lyrics from the best poets too
(Μελοποίηση- don’t know how to say this in English)
They existed throughout the 20th century
they had a long lifespan, but yes you are right
Ne re file but i just don't like greek music
But i haven't met anyone who doesn't
Aaaa ok
Non-Greek Hellenic varieties: I cannot understand Griko, Pontic or Tsakonian spontaneously
If it's Pontic with a lot of loanwords from Greek and written, I can sort of get the gist
I feel sad that I can’t really answer this question, as Greek is alone
But as somebody who has some decent knowledge of French and fluency in English, I could understand a lot of things when I went to Spain (and literally no one could speak to me in English, as I was in a village as an exchange student)
You are exaggerating
Cypriot Greek is different than Standard Greek on all levels, but it's still on the continuum of southern insular Greek varieties (especially Dodecanese, more distantly Cretan)
With enough exposure, they can understand most of it (except the culturally specific pragmatic nuances)
There are peripheral Hellenic varieties though that are non-mutually intelligible to either Standard Greek, or Modern Greek non-standard varieties
I'm talking about varieties like Tsakonian and Pontic
Only in some private schools, especially those for the children of high-profile immigrants
There's the Ecole Franco-Chypriote, for example
I assume those too, but the people I have in mind are mostly academics and businesspeople
Those are high-status roles in Cyprus
There's a lot of EFL classes, many Cypriots get university education in English, and there are a lot of opportunities to practice the language
There are Greek-English bilingual private schools of course, but most students attend public schools
Never heard of those
German is not an obligatory subject in Cyprus anyway
French is though
Zypern ist kein Bundesland
No worries

Who knew that leaving ammunition and explosives outdoors in 40°C heat for two years would be a bad idea
Cyprus here, for us it was the Mari explosion
UN forbidden a cargo of Iranian armor to continue their way to Iran
They asked from Cyprus government to accept the 100 containers of explosive to be store in the Island
Those who were responsible for the matter, they decided to leave them in plain side, outside on the ground within the naval base Zigi, which is also happens to be next from our central power station of the whole country
Since no one knew how dangerous the cargo was and also they did not know how to store them, while been exposed  for a while in our environment with hot temperatures, fires and high levels of humidity, eventually they exploded, killing 12 people and leaving the whole country without electricity for 3-4 months
If the explosion would  happened 1 hour later we would have more than 1000 death toll
The power station was completely destroyed
The complete blackout lasted for 2 days in the city centers and 4 days for the borders (villages)
The first 3-4 months we would have electricity from the backup generators (which are 3 in total, 2 backup generators in the capital Nicosia and 1 in the 2nd largest city Limassol) for about 2-3 hours and then 2-3 hours of blackout and it would go like this
All the shops and buildings proceeded to buy huge generators for their business and buildings for the elevators
I personally bought a UPS for my desktop
Electrical appliances in general were in trouble because of the sudden power cut outs
Many elder people had huge problems with the situation, also many died
It was summer and summer here in Cyprus hits 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit)
When the 4 months period past, different parts finally started arriving for the reconstruction of the main power station, and slowly slowly, 1 by 1, each section was getting in place and the cut outs were becoming less and less and within 1 year and something, the frequently cut outs stopped
Nope
Never
Cyprus
It's extremely easy to go to the occupied areas
Walking is the easiest
If you wanna take your car you need to get an insurance (on the spot) and pay the fee
The population of Cyprus is over 1 million only if you include the occupied territories
The pop of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus has less than 1 million people
French and Italian definitely
Yeah, that’s how it sound to me too
I think every monarch of Greece was a foreigner, or at least partly foreign
How can you mess up Cyprus
We literally have a picture of it on our flag
Bruh
To be honest that's actually really common
I remember asking a primary school student from Greece where does he think Cyprus is and he pointed to Rhode
It doesn't help that whenever we try to describe our location we just say next to  Greece
"Η Ρωμιοσύνη εν φυλή συνόκ̌αιρη του κόσμου, κανένας δεν εβρέθηκε για να την-ι ξηλείψη" από 9η Ιουλίου του Βασίλη Μιχαηλίδη
"Romiosyne (the Greek nation) is a tribe (race) with the same age as the world, no one has been found to efface (wipe out) it"   from "The 9th of July" by Vasilis Michaelides
This refers to the hypothetical words of the Archbishop of Cyprus Kyprianos before his execution by the Ottomans on the 9th of July 1821 when the Ottomans executed a lot of the clergy of Cyprus for suspected aid to the Greek war of independence and preparation of an independence movement in Cyprus
It is written in Cypriot Greek and not standard Greek
Vasilis Michaelides is regarded as the national poet of Cyprus since he has a lot of works in the Cypriot dialect

I'd say IKEA is popular in Cyprus, but definitely considered cheap outlet - acceptable house furniture, but not for professional use
It's restaurant (probably closed now) is also seen as an old people's social club, since they gather there in large numbers
This may be because IKEA in Nicosia is right opposite the General Hospital
74 would probably not happen if there were american military bases
As a Cypriot I can assure you that I know the Greek anthem just as good as I know the Cypriot one
Well not that well, but for how good they are, for me, the further from italy and France, the worse it is, with the biggest exceptions Germany and Russia
Germany's anthem has gotten worse and worse over the years
Deutschlandlied is kinda bad, Horst-Wessel-lied is
well uh
yeah
Heil dir im siegerkranz is kinda cool, better than God Save the Queen and as good as Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser
PREUßENS GLORIA IS BY FAR THE BEST GERMAN ANTHEM
Now, the State Anthem of the Russian Federation not as good as the State Anthem of the Soviet Union, but is still one of the best anthems in the continent
In Cyprus, not really
Save an unfamiliar word once every blue moon, I never encountered a Cypriot Greek speaker I couldn't understand
There are variants of Greek in Greece though that are completely incomprehensible to me
Anything that isn't Standard Greek or Southern Insular Greek is at least a bit challenging without some prior exposure
> Cyprus speaks Greek, or at least that's what they claim
I have no idea what they say most of the time though
I mean, that's not in your country though, is it
Depends where you are from though
If you are from the south or south-eastern Greek islands (Rhodos in particular), then Cypriot Greek should be very familiar
At this point, I have no idea
I had to go and visit some Cypriot newspapers to see what they do
Thousands: the dot, the non-breaking space, or nothing
Decimals: the comma
Unfortunately in Cyprus, the currency symbol goes before the number, so € 100
000,50 / 100 000,50 / 100000,50
We use commas del decimals and spaces for thousands separators eg 286 352,63
However , if you would have used a dot no one would notice .
He throws ashtrays when he is angry:)
It is a bit claustrophobic and air connections aren't seamless
Makes you feel a bit trapped when things aren't going as good
>  how in touch are you with mainland Europe
There are exceptions and I think I am one of them, but Europeans who come to Cyprus to work for a while always note how remarkably little we care about or feel part of the EU and the subcontinent
> do you keep up with what's happening in the x country
People would generally only follow news from Greece and Turkey for obvious reasons, and to a lesser extend the UK's. Rarely do European stories for which we don't have a direct connection make it in the first half of the news bulletin
> Do you feel European
I don't even know what that would mean
>  do you have any relatives in Europe
Some very distant ones in the UK
> I think Cyprus is an island so big that it feels like its on Mainland
I wouldn't say so
Especially since the internal borders close, you can only drive for two hours before you fall into the sea
> and there is no dispute about Cyprus not being on europe, Cyprus definitely is on Europe
I don't know if it's on the European continental shelf, but that's not the definition I am using
> BTW I am curious you as a Cypriot in which continent do you think that Cyprus belong to
I know empirically that Cyprus is an island
Now, since geology appears to be this important, I went and look it up, and Cyprus appears to have arose from the sea where the Anatolian and African continental plates collided
I am not sure if that means it belongs to either the Anatolian or the African continental shelf, because in real life no-one thinks about geology
> Also do you feel more connectd with other European coutries or with Asia or with Africa
Historically and socioculturally, I find more common ground with ex-Ottoman Empire places, so places like Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Israel/Palestine, Bosnia, Serbia, and so on
The exception from this pattern would be the UK
Now, those places are not all on a single continent
Some are in Europe, some are in Asia, some are in both
I guess if we are forced to categorise Cyprus, we can say it's a cross-continental country, spanning from Europe to Asia
I just don't understand the urge to do it
Ρήγας Φεραίος!;
I think they of get drawn up in Paphos'sea
I'm sure this doesn't apply exclusively to Greek, but I always slightly cringe when I have to say a Greek word with an English accent, I have no idea why
Even so English is a beautiful mess of a language
I am not particularly worried because:
I am going back to school in November, so there's a lot of time to react to new developments
I have a certain level of trust that German health authorities will react to a second wave appropriately and close schools again if necessary
My family lives in another country and I don't mingle with a lot of people
I am not in high risk myself, nor I am doing anything to increase my risk
EDIT: Keep in mind that the 'current situation' is not the same situation everywhere
I would probably be worried about reopening if I lived elsewhere
> Not even simply washing hands after a visit to the toilet
I had a very relevant experience when I first moved to Groningen for uni
That was still when COVID-19 wasn't considered a pandemic
At the men's toilets I saw that Dutch men would only momentarily put a few of their fingers under water and call this hand-washing
I thought that if the disease ever comes to the Netherlands, we will be fucked
It wasn't that severe in the north though
Before now, I lived in the Netherlands, and there there was a discussion about dedicated university bus lines, to avoid the danger of cross-contamination so to speak
So I guess it is a valid concern
In the Netherlands, they used to strictly enforce 50% capacity on public transport until July 1st
Did that ever happen in Germany
I really don’t know why, but your country is always associated with gypsies in Cyprus
Can’t tell you what our brothers in Greece and Turkey think, but on the island that seems to be the consensus
Cheap labour that come and and still the jobs here(since they work for really low wages)
And they say Germans have no sense of humor
Well, not Greek
It's *sfirí* in the standard language, which sounds like a sexual innuendo
In Cypriot Greek it's *mátsa*, which sounds like you are calling a cat in Serbian
Here we go, point proven :P
*Seek immediate medical help if you experience an erection that looks like a sfirí.*
Greek spelling is historical and relatively '[deep] (but not as much as English)
Spelling exercises are common in primary school ('dictation'), but it never turned into a competition
It's not so much a language issue, but rather a culture difference (less focus on spectacle)
Essay competitions are a thing, but that's about prose structure and argumentation
Directly by popular vote but with a run-off election in case no candidate receives more than half the votes
The two most popular candidates go to a second round a week later
It's not an instant run-off because the week between is used to form alliance agreements with the runner-up candidates
It's the equivalent of coalition governments in parliamentary systems, only the government doesn't need their ongoing support after the election
The Parliament is elected separately
I don't actually find it sensible
It has two bad outcomes: either a wildly unpopular executive stays in power because they only need broad acceptance on election day and have unchecked power for the rest of their terms, or their coalition partners abandon them a year before the legislative elections in order to campaign, meaning that the executive can't pass any laws in the parliament (e.g. this year, they might not even be able to pass the budget because legislative elections are coming up in 7 months)
If it's going to the a presidential system, I am probably in favour of syncing the elections
What benefits do you see
Perhaps a fair point
But that's just patching a broken system
I think I lean more towards a parliamentary system
The Cypriot presidential system especially has next to zero checks and balances
It can be an elected fixed-term dictatorship if the President decides they want it to be that
If the parliament doesn't vote for their laws, they can just resort to executive orders
The equivalent for Cyprus would be "I'm voting B so that C doesn't go to the run-off election". It's very common in the presidential elections
Since we elect presidents in a two-round run-off election, if the two runner-ups (say B & C) are about as popular but one of them you really hate and/or consider a threat in the second round, then you may not vote for your favourite candidate in the first round if they are leading the polls
Similarly, if you are voting for a minor candidate in the first round normally, but B & C are really close and you think C is beyond horrible, you may abandon your losing candidate for B. (Voting for minor candidates is not always a waste, because having upper-single digits levels of support still gives them enough leverage to ask for a minor cabinet position by promising to direct their voters to one of the leading candidates in the second round)
Nor particularly common in legislatives because the system is proportional
It was allegedly important in the last European Parliament Elections, where there are only 6 seats and Cyprus is a single constituency (the claim is that declining EDEK (S&D) wouldn't get the last seat if it wasn't for voters of all other parties voting for them so that the neonazi party wouldn't win that seat)
I would say [Michalis Violaris - Ta rialia] Is a well known song with the cypriot dialect

People in Berlin seem to generally ride so-called sportsbikes, either rigid mountainbikes or roadbikes
I ride a roadbike myself, but honestly there are so many potholes that a mountainbike makes more sense
I don't have the money for a separate commuting and sports bike though, so it will have to do
There are also city/oma-bikes with baskets and racks around, but not nearly as much as in the Netherlands
German law is quite strict about which additional equipment a bike needs, including multiple reflectors, battery lights, a bell, maybe other things
What's crucial for me is to have handbrakes (not that dreaded footbrake all bikes in the Netherlands have), and at least a few gear speeds
Germany is not that flat, you need them sometimes
The cycling infrastructure in Berlin is minimal and not well maintained, so you have to be comfortable riding on the road
The good thing is that big junctions have bike turning lanes that really help
So far no car driver tried to make a right turn over me, they always yield
I am not sure I understand what you mean by veering in another lane
Most of the time you will be at the rightmost position in your lane so there's no danger of entering the opposite direction by mistake
I guess you have to have decent depth perception for left turns
That being said, I don't see business executives cycling in Berlin
It's mostly people under 30 and over 60
* * *
In Cyprus, only a trivial amount of people cycles at all, and it's mostly mountainbikes, both because they are cheaper and because Cyprus is quite hilly
It's not for the faint-hearted or for those who have any other choice, unless you are doing to prove a point, like I used to
In Joensuu so many locals used fatbikes, which looked weird in September but their wisdom was obvious when it started snowing
Yeah that sounds like some basic skills you have to develop before you can use a bike for your commute
Keeping a predictable course is very important on the road
Eyes on the road ahead is very important in achieving that
I'm quite satisfied with myself for surviving a Finnish winter on a basic bike without slipping on ice once (came close twice, but saved it)
But I'm not looking forward to having to repeat it, to be honest
So we are partly Europeans since we don't eat bloody meat but a dog is more than a pet

14 years
1960-1974
36,7% of the Republic of Cyprus is under foreign occupation
There are 40
000 turkish soldiers on the lands of the Republic of Cyprus
Refugees still wait to return ti their homes
So not really
Ioannina
it's just
BAD
Turkey
To visit Turkey of what I read I will have to state that I am from the "Greek Administration of Southern Cyprus". Even though I would really like to visit it some day I won't deny the existence of the Republic of Cyprus to do so
(All these not considering what Turkey currently (2020) does in Cyprus)
Not never but least likely, France
Why
Idk, not for me
But maybe remoter parts of france
I’ve been to turkey in 2012
Secular version is not very nice either I don't think that's the issue with Turkey, the issue is the extreme levels if nationalism within the country people think that everything the nation does is justified armenians, cyprus invasion, etc etc and currently stuff thats going on in Syria, imagine they went in there as operation "peace spring" and now they are waging war, on social media people are using a hastag thats promoting the war and one refugees i think in Turkey called the army "dogs" or something like that and turks found where he lived and beat him up
They are glorifying this on social media in nationalistic posts
I call Turkey bootleg USA except it seems like everyone is a patriot in Turkey
Turkey isn't even that hot in some regions
Yep
A Free United Cyprus for all Cypriots:)
Yeah but you will come as a citizen of Turkey
I am okay with having a stop in Greece-even though having to apply for visa there isn't really sth that anyone would like-(I am okay to have a stop in Greeve for many countries
Cyprus doesn't connect with many European countries with Portugal being my no1)
You had to go to Greece to get a visa right
(is what I said accurate
I went by cruise from Piraeus
But yes, if you want to go to turkey, you have to go to Greece first, since they don’t recognise us
(Ironic)
It is very mountainous thats why it snows there, Greece is much hotter
I don't think wanting the Turkish army to leave undermines equality
That's really not the case
I mean if you take a look at everything the Greek Cypriot side accepted
It's because Cyprus isn't in Schengen(even though we want to join they don't let us because of the situation)
I mean could you go in Ireland with that
Just saw this
really that's bullshit
"TRNC" completely relies on Turkey to exist
That's really not the case with the Republic of Cyprus
I just searched a bit
There is a village in the Ammochostos/Famagusta district (it's in the occupied areas)
When someone is late we say "Is he coming from Τζιάος" (it's a village that in 1973-last census- had less than 1000 inhabitants)
Not sure who lives there after the invasion
Tibuktu is also another faraway place sometimes used
Pergamos (Πέρκαμος used like Τζιάος), it was a greek city in Minor Asia, today Turkey
(I didn't know, just search)
The rest words aren't used as places
Aνάθεμα not sure how to translate it
The last word that I think is Τριβιλλουρα and of what I understand it has something to do with three(τρια) and penis  (this is probably the word that I would say if you only asked for one)
Timbuktu is used here too
(But we have other words too)
Yeah everyone ignored it since the mosque shooting gathered much more attention, just media at their usual shit, I saw the school shooting at reddit r/watchpeopledie
The University of Cyprus and the Cyprus University of Technology (CUT) . Those are the best ones since they are only public ones .
Public universities in Cyprus are better than private ones because in order to get in them you have to get a really good grade in the Cypriot national exams .
However we have a couple good private ones aswell like the University of Nicosia (UNIC) .
Speaking about the continuum between Cypriot Greek and Standard Greek in Cyprus:
> Is switching to the standard dialect something people do
Yes, while the situation is always evolving (in favour of Cypriot Greek gaining foothold to new domains), we are socialised to know when we need to use the Standard Greek register and we semi-unconsciously switch in and out of it
> or can be asked to do in your country
That would be extremely bizarre and some people would take offence
As adult native speakers, we *know* when we should use Standard Greek through our early-life socialisation
If we are not using Standard Greek in that situation, then that's because it's not socially acceptable to use Standard Greek in that situation
To enter a colloquial language situation and demand that an official register is used is a very marked behaviour, it makes you seem conceited and elitist
But, talking to low/medium-fluency speakers of Greek as a foreign language is one of the situations we are socialised to use Standard Greek for
Talking to people from Greece who haven't been in Cyprus for a sufficient amount of time (in the ballpark of 3 months) is also one of the situations we are socialised to use Standard Greek for
Here it's the same as Germany
I like my country's passport I don't see a reason to use a different one
Wait, what
When did this happen
The problem with unemployment cannot be seen with a sole lens
On the one hand, you have strong labour market protections
That means, even if the economy is doing relatively well, there will always be a small portion of the population out of employment
In these countries they prefer strong employment protections, job security and high investment in the workforce
For those who are out of employment, there is a strong safety net and of course family help
The Mediterranean countries built their model around those notions
For a time it worked, but times have changed
So yeah it was preferable to have quality jobs with iron clad contracts
As it is a high investment companies would be very sceptical to hire new people all the time
On the other hand, there is a decline in industry
Nowadays countries are becoming more service oriented so a lot of people who are not skilled cannot find work
If someone who has worked in minds for 30 years and now is out of employment, where can he work
This is a multidimensional issue, and i have already reduced it a lot
These are just reasons that partly explain the issue
But bear in mind, that these countries prefer it that way (see France for instance, 40+ days of strikes because they don't want to change their model)
In general I don't see a huge problem with permanent residents receiving that right, but I would focus on making the path to citizenship be not a malicious joke
Same with my family in Russia that lived near the border with Ukraine
We didn't like the corruption and ethnic biases; but at the same time looking back at it we at least had some form of social safety net
Now it's just full of smugglers, crime, and people trying to escape their region or vie for independence
Δεν νομίζω πως είναι ιδιωματισμοί/ εκφράσεις αυτά.
Οκ....
If you mean , speaking only my native language, then the answer would be Greece
I can piece together some German, French, or Turkish if my life depends on it, but my life really has to depend on it
But I was surprised to walk into a bakery in St Petersburg and stumble upon a Russian woman who felt bad for not being able to serve me in English, only to find out she spoke Greek
But that was an extremely rare event, usually Greek can only be of use in Greece and Cyprus (yes, even the north part)
Apparently it also doesn't hurt to try your luck with German in ex yu
When I was waiting for my bus to Ljubljana from Belgrade, some other foreigners had trouble communicating with the kiosk lady in English, until they realised they both spoke German, and then proceeded to have a lengthy conversation
>I can certainly talk to Cypriots even though there's a chance they'll only understand me without me understanding them
That's only if we won't try
I have heard that Azerbaijani is similar to Turkish but how mutually intelligible are they
Do you need to study them first a bit
Wow that's interesting
Greek doesn't have any "relative-like languages" so I can't understand how it is to be able to understand other languages
And I guess written language must be way easier right
Haha
I hope you didn't learn it by experience :p
Yes if you see it that way
I didn't consider them separate languages though
I haven't heard someone speaking Tsakonian irl but in videos and I can understand them
Again, speaking Cypriot Greek helps a lot
The same goes with Ancient Greek as well
Yes that's true
It's also funny that it seems we can understand everyone but Nobody can understand us
It would be also great if we learned the island's native languages as well
Oh that's a shame for Cypriot Turkish
I can't say the same for Cypriot Greek
On the contrary, there is a rise in its usage, even in media, films etc
Yeah learning the other native languages of the island would be nice
We currently have a program which is basically free to learn Turkish
Waffles, Chocolate, Brussels, EU, Three official languages, complex government, Benelux, Steel, Industrialisation
Federation
Yeah me too
Actually when we discuss about our issue, Belgium always pops up in my mind and I think "oh we will be like Belgium,best case scenario"
Exactly
Likr I fucking hope we will be like Belgium
plsss not Bosnia Herzegovinaaa
Yeah that's why I was thinking best case scenario Belgium
Fingers crossed, this will happen soon and it will succeed
Yeah:)
I would say Turkey but
not in Europe XDDDDDD
Anyway, in Europe
Bulgaria and the UK (and maybe Italy)
We joke about Bulgarians because we don't hate them but seriously guys
if you're gonna come here as the biggest people to migrate for a job, you're gonna expect to be made fun of
The UK because Brexit and we literally have a border with them and they can't decide for *_shite_* and because they're white af (yep literally what we do every time)
Italy
it's Italy
Cyprus is not in Europe as well geographically, modern Turkish people are Anatolian genetically just their identity is "Turkish"
These are nice :D
1) How can I get a cyprus tag
2) Yes
Geofraphically
politically we are in Europe
turkey isn't
Yeah but people are also shit so more like american people but canada's position
Εμπάθεια (empatheia)
It sound like empathy, but it’s the opposite
It means immense hate, animosity towards someone
Don’t worry, as long as you are respectful in general, people should show understanding that you are a tourist and not be harsh on you
We should all learn to be more welcoming, especially since tourists contribute to the economy and they’ve paid to travel to the destination
In Greek[1], a floor/storey is referred to as όροφος (órofos) and it's defined as the living space between two *ceilings* (compare οροφή/orofí = ceiling)
Because of that, the first storey of a building cannot help but be the one that sits on top of the first ceiling
The living space on street level is referred to as ισόγειο (isóghio; ground-level), and you typically do not refer to  isóghio as an órofos because it's not between two ceilings
It can be indicated as "0" or "GF" on elevator buttons
[1]: With the peculiar exception of public hospitals in Cyprus, which do seem to treat the ground floor as the first floor
Maybe some international hospital building code mandates that
I went on all my life thinking that Cypriots invented tahini pie, but it turns out versions of it exist all the way to the Caucasus
Is that version soaked in syrup
We have a place called paralimni
The town is near a lake and its name stands for "by the lake"
What's more embarassing is that this town is the biggest town in the free part of the district of famagusta
I really like making such lists because they give you some perspective
Pros:
*The weather
If you like long hot summers and mild winters then Cyprus is your place
But I know that this is subjective but at least something that is necessary such as sunshine in order to absorb vitamin D is essential
* Mediterranean food
* It's an island ,so access to beaches
Cons:
*Conservative society
*Limited access to Continental Europe because it's an island
*Very small
Only 1,1 milion people
>absolutely catastrophic customer service
I'm curious, what are some examples of that
Are you originally from Cyprus
Oh it doesn't matter
I was asking because you Said you would want to live here
The Polish / Yugoslavian anthems
The French national anthem
The East German anthem
The Polish/Ukrainian folk song "sokoly"
The Union version of "down to Dixie"
The Irish Rebel song "Go on home British soldiers"
And of course a lot of Russian ones
The largest geography-based identification I can conceive is East Mediterranean (Levantine)
Both Asia and Europe are way too big to be a meaningful identification
> We are not one single thing, we are the embodiment of all of these things mixed together
You just can't classify us as one single entity
So one doesn't feel more European or Asian, one feels everything together
Excellently put
That's characteristic of our region
We definitely had a discussion along those lines in another thread
I don't see a contradiction
There's plenty of progressive political tendencies in East Med, including LGBTQ activism
After all, Greece is also part of East Med and there's a lot of LGBTQ activists there, but also in Cyprus, Turkey, Israel, and with some voices becoming stronger in Lebanon and Jordan
We are perhaps fighting a tougher battle here because we have the legacies of very recent and sometimes still on-going wars making people more insular and apprehensive, but I really object to the notion that we need outside saviours to replace our political cultures with theirs
We want and need their solidarity, and we can learn from their experiences, but ultimately there's a local flavour to the conservatism we are up against, so we only those with that local knowledge can bring change that is more than skin-deep and that can last
Yeah, one has to be very cautious with adjectives like that, because they obscure so much nuance, and they also reinforce some rather problematic ideas about human rights somehow being specifically a 'European culture'.
The issue of nuance is why I think that identifying with anything more than East Med is unsuitable for Cyprus
Cyprus cannot be correctly understood if it's just examined as a European country, or if it's just examined as an Asian country
We have to zoom-in at least at regional level

Storage media
I personally see it as pretty good
I think the same applies for the generations of 40+
Young people consider it bad (you can see ton of memes about "stuff from Lidl")
No thats gay af
I am a firm believer of the following process
a) If you are a representative of an organisation, you identify your self first - no matter who called who
b) If the above is not the case, then the person who initiated the call has the duty to identify themselves first
With that in mind, in Greek I answer the phone with "**parakaló**" (literally: "please", ~bitte), and in English with "**hello**".
Callers who don't identify themselves annoy me greatly
It should be obvious that (b) doesn't apply to mobile calls from numbers I recognise
If I know who's calling, I open with either "éla" (~go) or "nné" (~yes), and I don't expect them to say their name
It's 59 years old:)
Founded in 1960
Independence day was on 16 of August
But 15 of August is an orthodox celebration that everyone combines with vacation
As you understand everyone was on holidays these days(including ambassadors from other countries)
Anyway they changed it and we celebrate independence day on October 1st
Cyprus has had numerous problems throughout its endless history, so despite being the 3rd oldest civilisation in the world, the country was officially founded in 1960
Cyprus is wayyyyy older than Republic of Cyprus
Under standard copyright laws (with minor jurisdictional variations), work you create during work hours belongs to your employer *unless* there's a different agreement in place - in a way, your university is not even aware of their true legal power, they could claim 100% without even passing a new regulation
Copyright laws are counter-intuitive and a lot of normal social activities go against its provisions
It's obviously wrong, and if there's ever a reason for a mass student protest, this is it
My field doesn't produce creative output so the experience is different for me personally
I wrote some code in the context of research, and I slapped a copyleft license on it and my supervisors never challenged it
It's not really monetisable, so no-one cares
You are thinking of "author's moral rights". That's in additional, mostly European, set of rights that sits on top of copyright law
Almost all countries in the world (with the exception of a few in the ballpark of North Korea and Ethiopia), are signatories to a series of international copyright treaties so copyright is more or less uniform around the world
When you go to studies unless you live in Nicosia or Limassol and you are studying there
(I live in a village/town that is around 30 mins by car from Nicosia-originally it's 13 mins but because of the turkish occupation you can't go that way- and even though everyone who studies in Cyprus drives-and owns- a car most of them rent in Nicosia

The article cites poverty as the reason, but I think they are just guessing

Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, but you can't find the Cypriot dialect anywhere unless you talk about it, soooo
Pirates of the Carribbean, random sailors speaking Cypriot Greek and Cypriot Turkish
First time I saw it, I could not believe it was not a parody
You don't expect the dialect of a tiny island to make it into a major Hollywood blockbuster
Cyprus have been fully independent for only 13 years
Fan fact about Cyprus: a guy in the invasion 1974 got shot 13 times, two times to the head before dying
Yeah right xd
The son of Mary becoming king of both Scotland and England
Well, 36,7% of my country is under foreign occupation (1/3 of the Greek Cypriot population became refugees in 1974 and still can't return to their homes)
Hm okay
Well the British bases aren't considered occupation
They are legally there since it is a part of our Constitution
In fact it is a part of one of the three main Treaties, the Treaty of Establishment
The British Empire gave independence to the island but excluded around 3% of it and kept it as sovereign bases
How legal is that when the creator of the Constitution and the Republic of Cyprus is Britain is another story
All parties here asked the government last year to make steps to get rid of the british bases(there was a decision from the International Law of Justice about a similar case for Mauritius that called the bases illegal because it violate the right of self determination in those areas)
Well about the Turkish occupation
idk
it remains the hottest topic in the political scene of Cyprus for 50+ years
Opinions are different on what led us to the occupation between the leftists and the rightists and that's something that isn't discusses often between them
Unfortunately after all these years many people died without returning to their homes
Υw!
That Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots hate each other
We don’t

Wanna share a recipe
We expanded and internationalised the European community by granting European Union citizenship to the best and brightest white-collar criminals the world had to offer
RIP Citizenship by Investment 2013-2020^and^never^again^anywhere
That was a good one, yeah
I'm still on my Cypriot SIM even though I live permanently abroad
Thanks, Malta
You guys really tried to undercut the market though, that wasn't nice
800k EUR
That's mere corporate fraud-level criminals
At least we, with a minimum investment of 2m, only admitted politicians who robbed their entire country's wealth and made a run for it
Not a single person did it
It's a web of corruption that transcends a single member of the executive, or the ruling party
As for consequences, the fallout from Cyprus Papers is ongoing, but I have very low expectations
When everyone was "in it", no one is going to point fingers
What's worse is that there's [upwards of 6000 Cypriot kids] that remain stateless[1] because the same Council of Ministers that rubber-stamps oligarchs' citizenship applications is also using a 1999 law that allows them to indefinitely suspend the otherwise automatic process of citizenship by descent
[1]: Stateless to the extend that a TRNC citizenship doesn't mean much outside the northern part and in Turkey & by taking into account that while they have the possibility of obtaining a Republic of Turkey citizenship, most of those kids are afraid that doing so which harm their RoC citizenship application
As a result, they remain in a limbo of statelessness until they say 'fuck it, I will apply for a Turkish passport'.
Why would you do that isn’t it cheaper in other countries
My Cypriot phone number is a "stable unique identifier" - I don't often need it for outgoing calls, sms or data but it's the one phone number people can always reach me at (paying local rates and at no charge to me) even though I move countries a lot
Of course, I buy prepaid local SIMs for data where I go
> but what do you expect in a country of 600k people
How do you have more than half the population of Cyprus in less than a third of the surface area
> Yep, so you need to go to the Greek side to have a baby with any hope of a passport, how messed up is that
That wouldn't make a difference, the "problem" is that the non-Cypriot parent in those cases has Turkish citizenship
Also, don't normalise the south as a "Greek side" please
That's the partition scenario
That wouldn't be possible
We have international dialling codes that change from country to country, and different numbering plans that are either too-long, too-short or duplicates of other countries' already assigned numbers
What is probably possible is some sort of VoIP bridge that picks up calls from my Cypriot SIM, calls my German SIM, and relays the sound between the two
But that would be pointless and more expensive in the long run than buying a Dual-SIM phone
Does that mean there's very little farming and forests within the borders
I guess that's major reason why Luxembourg was always in the heart of regional integration initiatives
EDIT: Of course, I always forget to consider that not all countries are islands
I guess you don't feel claustrophobic due to the population density because the land doesn't stop at the borders
The relevant section of the Citizenship Law:
> Citizenship by birth or origin 109 .— (1) A person born in Cyprus on or after 16 August 1960 is a citizen of the Republic if at the time of his birth any of his parents was a citizen of the Republic or, in the case of which this parent did not live at the time of the birth of that person, this parent would be entitled, if he had not died, to become a citizen of the Republic:
> **It is understood that the provisions of this paragraph do not apply, *unless the Council of Ministers otherwise order*, in cases where the entry or stay in Cyprus of any of the parents of that person was illegal
This provision suspends the automatic birthday and gives power to the government to decide on a case by case basis
Within a rounding error, all Turkish citizens who enter Cyprus after 1974 do so in what constitutes illegal ports of entry for this law (all ports of entry in the northern side are considered illegal, it's very hard for a Turkish citizen to get a Visa from RoC in order to enter from legal ports of entry)
The Council of Ministers' discretion is pretty wide, but it doesn't include Cypriots born to one Turkish parent after 1974 which is pretty targeted as far as legislation goes
Those are the cases in which the government allows the suspended birthright to be applied:
> According to the criteria set by the Council of Ministers for the exercise of the above discretion, the citizenship is obtained:
> - children of mixed T / C marriages with Turkish citizens born before or on July 20, 1974
> - children of mixed T / C marriages with third country nationals outside Turkey, or with EU citizens and other countries with which it has relations with the Republic of Cyprus
> - children of mixed marriages T / C with Turkish citizens where the marriage took place abroad before July 20, 1974
> - Children of mixed marriages where the parents met abroad, such as e.g. during studies
> - children of mixed marriages residing in Pyla
Note how those "exceptions" undo the entire provision of the Citizenship Law except when the parent has Turkish citizenship and arrived after 1974 (e.g. the second point allows the process of citizenship to go on for the Cypriot child of one foreign parent whose entry or stay in the northern part of Cyprus is otherwise illegal )
That's some good maps right there, thanks
Yeah the topography is quite different than what I'm used to
Hello
I think it's everywhere
When I was at university I felt like a fish out of the water
I was the only male in my class that didn't bet
omg it's a freaking epidemic
Turkish settlers, where, when; everytime I go out soon Cypriots will be exterminated so I guess they are the ones having a culture shock in our island
wtf is 185cm average :(
My favourite Cypriot documentary is "Our Wall" (Το τείχος μας · Duvarımız)
Unfortunately, as with most of Chrysanthou's filmography, barely anyone wants to distribute it
[This] may be a source, but I can't vouch for it
I bought the DVD from him personally several years ago
A more accessible runner-up is [Sharing an Island] (2011)
I haven't watched it a second time, unlike Our Wall which I always return to
But it covers similar themes
For an aspect of Cyprus history that is barely ever talked about, there's [The Third Motherland] (2011)
You're welcome
The Arabic-speaking community of Cyprus is a surprise for most of us as well, they have been historically so marginalised with dire consequences for the intergenerational transmission of their language
We’re the only ones that put the [month and year of registration] on them so
Well here someone could be cooked alive by not turning on the a/c because of the 40 plus summer
No most people don't have a second name . However there are some people with 2 names e.g. Giorgos Constantinos , ( George Constantine) , that's a recent trend and I think it's when the couple  can't agree on a single name, especially when they both want to give the child their parent's name ( it's common for a person to be named after their grandparent here ) .
And southern Eu includes which countries
[Liberty Square (Πλατεία ελευθερίας), Nicosia, Cyprus ] designed by Zaha Hadid, completed in *just* 15 years
Although it might not fit in with the [457 year old Venetian Walls] as the mayor said (from his eyesore of a city hall), “it’s a breath of European air”
"We are too different"
We are pretty happy with the EU
The latest Eurobaromer though showed a dissatisfaction - a record low approval for the EU , because of the EU's stance on the drillings in our EEZ
I guess GCs are dissatisfied because the EU doesn't do anything about it
Overall though we are happy about it
I am just wondering, isn't that something that TCs want
If I were you, I would seriously want to be part of the EU
Even if you don't trust the GCs, I guess being in the EU guarantees that no troubles will ever happen again
My country is a separate case its not based on differences but deeper political reasons and prior propaganda it has nothing to do with the subject
How do you think the roman empire came into being, the "differences" you listed are differences that arise after we are born they are taught differences no one is saying lets instantly create this EU state, but lets just take a step towards that
It is indeed in the best interests of all of us to unite the island
I wish more people thought like you ! I am really sad that my compatriots in the North have to endure this isolation and lack of opportunities
And to be honest, as time goes by, the solution also fades away
We have got to act quickly, I agree
Locals were already living together mixed and happy they were transported from Turkey to Greece and vice versa according to the treaties between the two countries not according to individual choices
If you looked as of right now to the cultures of those countries you will notice that there are many many similarities both genetic and cultural, although the latter is more common
So how did these changes happen if they were so different from each other
Living under ottoman empire, why did the Greek independence start
Because they were opressed as Christians under the Ottomans not opressed by the others that lived amongside them, would an European federaion opress people
I did not say lets create a second Roman empire I gave that example because Roman empire was an example of a great multiethnic empire
Even USA is multiethnic, Turkey is multiethnic to actually but you know why the country does not have intercommunal issues
Its because they are united under this identity of Turkishness which was just born together with the kemalist movement after the collapse of the empire
So what I'm saying is by taking a step towards this which we already did (European Union) we are moving closer towards a world government slowly but it will get there maybe in 100 years maybe in 1000
You just said it yourself you learn your culture from your environment, so what happens to people in mixed environments there are no pure countries and with the refugee crisis almost every country is mixed to some extent, by living in the same environment you learn about others and they don't seem so alien to you after a while and you just notice that they are human too with almost identical behaviors
As a side not there are no Turks and Greeks in Cyprus, we have our own culture and identity its called Cypriot
Yeah mistakes were made from both sides
I think it helps that Nowadays our youths can communicate and build trust and Ultima put those mistakes aside so that they can live together in harmony
In our community is somewhat the opposite
At least two decades ago, we were growing with nationalist minded people
But over the years that has changed
Now I trust our people are far more open minded
As for the settler children, I honestly don't know what to say
I know it's not their fault that they are here and they have known no other homeland but it is sill a touchy subject for GCs
What do you think would be a good solution for them in the new union
(I personally believe that those who are here, are of course entitled to citezinship of the new federal state, but   i fear that things can escalate quickly with this issue)
We have pretty much unrestricted right to dual citizenship, and I haven't read a single article supporting restricting it
We don't have any idea why we would want to take that right away from people
Used to, in a rather disgraceful money-grabbing scheme by the incumbent government and a cabal of lawyers and land developers
The scheme was finally halted last November
The practice was absolutely despised and it's one more reason why even us Cypriot emigrants should have the right to vote in Cypriot elections even if we are abroad
The current government is eroding the value of our citizenship and we should be able to vote them out
> Is it fair that three million Turks who live on Germany and don't even speak Turkish can vote for a presidential dictatorship in Turkey in a referendum
What if the reason that many of them don't want to return to Turkey forever *yet* is the existence of a presidential dictatorship
They have a stake in that referendum, or in the next legislative election
I am not a dual citizen, just a resident/emigrant
If I end up becoming a dual citizenship in my country of residence, I fall under an exception and I can keep my original citizenship
> Wait, you can't?
Not this year, COVID makes it extremely hard to pull it off
But that's not my main point: I am empathising with the people who had to forfeit their first citizenship in order to receive the one of their country of residence (because I am temporarily unable to exercise my right to vote, which is what happens to them irrevocably when they naturalise in a country that doesn't accept dual citizenship), and providing reasons as to why someone can feel like they have stakes in keeping both citizenships (because several people here aren't able to imagine how you may feel that way)
> I think that's wrong, we should only vote where it will affect us
You should first defend the implied premise that we are only affected by the politics of a single place
I live in Germany (as a student), I intent to stay in Germany if I can apply my skills here and if I manage to fulfil the naturalisation criteria at some point in the future, I will pursue it as I want to have a vote in the system under which I reside
At the same time, I am -not so willingly- a National Guard reservist and I could be called to fight a war I may consider unjust and self-destructive, my family exclusively lives in Cyprus and their well-being is absolutely affected by Cypriot politics, and of course, the all-time American classic: I'm a tax payer
I pay taxes in Cyprus, I have social security contributions in Cyprus from past employment there before I moved and so on
Say something like the 2013 post-election financial crash happens again and the then government decides that they will use the Social Insurance Fund to bail out a failing private bank
There's myriads of ways that we emigrants are still affected by the politics of our home countries even if we are not there on the ground
We are even affected by some ways that are unique to us, like diplomatic relations and bilateral treaties
Whether the two countries of citizenship remain part of the same political union too affects emigrants a lot more than the rest
You need to back up that silent premise
> Can non-Germans resident in Germany vote in general elections
They are referring to dual citizens of Germany and Turkey, they are not just non-citizen residents
Are you somehow implying that the right to vote should be conditional on what a group is likely to vote for
Your sentence doesn't make sense to me, what you say after the "so" simply restates what you said before it
Can you elaborate what the rule is and what is the "that" that is a non-issue
I think *you* don't fully grasp the idea
People are currently living in one country but paying taxes in two; people are currently living in one country but being affected by the politics of two countries; people are currently living in one country but have loved ones and real bonds to two countries
This is how it works in real life
Do you thing that all people who emigrate into a new country pack all their relatives and friends into their luggage (or stop caring about their well-being), transfer all their assets, and wipe the ties to their homeland for their minds and then forfeit the citizenship so they can't be drafted in a war
That's not how emigration works for most if not all emigrants
Only very traumatic cases of emigration lead to zero-ties situations
Did you experience the kind of emigration that you think is "obvious"? Do you know anyone who experienced that kind of zero-ties emigration
> It was a more general question
Like if I went to live in Germany could I vote on grounds of residence despite not being a citizen
Well, the answer is that you can't - I asked for myself a couple of days ago
If you are an EU citizen, you can vote for the local council (and for MEPs), but not any of the other elections at state or federal level
> I feel like everyone is talking at cross-purposes on the question
Perhaps, since there was clearly a communication breakdown
But from my part, I never addressed b) which I assume means non-citizen residents
This is a thread about dual citizens
The thread is about dual citizens, the comment at the start of this comment thread was about dual citizens, and my replies were about dual citizens
If we are suddenly talking about something else, the person introducing the new topic has to signal it somehow
And that's what I'm saying as well
People may be suffering because they country took such a political turn that it has become unliveable for them, to such extend that they have emigrated
Those who still long to return definitely have a stake in the politics back in their home country about as much as they have a stake in their country of long-term residency, and they would very much like to have a right to vote
You can't make an exception to this principle just for Erdoğan-supporting Turks, or it's no longer a principle and you have to come up with another one
Perhaps you never felt like this either because you haven't been an immigrant for a long duration of time, or you have been one during times easy international travel, but I find myself in that situation were I can't vote in Cypriot elections this year even though I find them extremely important as the country is at a turning point, and that pains me
My barrier is temporary caused by the pandemic travel restrictions, but I can empathise with those who are irrevocably asked to choose between their home country or the residency country, as if they can only be affected from the politics in only one of the two as the same time
Okay, I sort of get it now
I support exactly the opposite thing
If it's really not relevant, I'm sorry but that's because you haven't made your point clear
But sure, let's end it here and let the arguments stand for themselves

It is an automatic process governed by mostly phonological rules for sure, but even adult, typically developed native-speakers of Greek do not have a 100% accuracy
According to Varlokosta (2011), when confronted with unfamiliar words, Greek speakers have an extremely high accuracy (95~99%) when it comes to providing the matching article for unambiguously feminine and masculine words
That accuracy can go as 74% when it concerns unambiguously neuter words (which are often converted to feminine due to sound similarity)
Finally, even if it concerns familiar words, there's less-than-perfect performance when it comes to nouns ending with the sounds /os/. Those can be any of the three genders, but there's a strong tendency for /os/ to become a specifically masculine noun suffix
Words moving between grammatical gender have been very common during the evolution of the Greek language
I am not even touching upon what happens with loanwords, because that's an entire book volume on its own

The President was Makarios III
He was the leader of the Turkish Cypriots before Denktaş.

And how are you going to use that exactly
are you going to say something in english
Usa and their understanding of "Races/Ethinc identities" are so retarded I don't even bother, they are people who got mixed and lost their original identity and now they just associate identity by skin colour
Cyprus too
We call it τάβλι. (Távli)
The capital, *Nicosia*, probably
People I meet in Europe know Limassol and Paphos from their vacations, and Larnaca because of the airport there
Nicosia, being the only non-coastal city and the least-developed tourist destination, seems to be less salient
True, they fucked up a lot of place names with the Greekification in the late 90s. I think though that, at least on main roads, Nicosia will be mentioned in brackets after Lefkosia
Ayia Napa is a village though
One of the military bases is inside Limassol - I sure hope RAF pilots know that and won't accidentally land in Yeroskipou or something
Nicosia is the capital, yes
I didn't mean to imply otherwise
I am not surprised AskEurope posters are more aware of Nicosia than the general average European
Most of us here are interested in geography and politics and therefore we know obscure capital cities
But the general public will mostly know Cyprus as a tourist destination, and the capital isn't very touristic
> APOEL
I am sorry for your loss :P
> Hold on, so Lefkosia is the correct name for the city
*Lefkosía* is the Greek name for the city and the oldest of the three names, *Lefkoşa* is the Turkish name for the city derived from the Greek name, and *Nicosia* is the Italian/Latin/Internationalised name for it derived also from the Greek but with a regular sound change
It was very common for Cypriot place names to have internationalised versions that didn't sound much like the original, the most prominent being Nicosia (Lefkosia), Limassol (Lemesos), and Famagusta (Ammochostos)
As a reaction to the mass-scale renaming campaign in the northern side by Turkey after 1974 (where Greek names were replaced by invented Turkish names [1]), in the 90s there was a similar state-sponsored campaign to make placenames in the south sound "more Greek". They didn't attempt to replace the names completely [2] but they still faced a lot of opposition by the locals, who loved their place names even if they sounded Turkish, Arabic, or Italian
That's why there's still multiple versions of the same place name in both the south and north part of the island
[1] E.g. the town known in Greek as Morphou and in pre-1974 Turkish as Omorfo, became Güzelyurt
[2] But instead they attempted to remove the "Cypriot" sounds that don't exist in Greece Greek, e.g. attempting to rename the town La**tch**a into La**kk**ia
In the end they couldn't convince the locals, and they went for the compromise La**ts**ia
But smaller towns or abandoned villages couldn't resist as effectively
Indeed
And Dhekelia is sandwiched between the districts of Larnaca and Famagusta but not really touching any city
I'm not a nazi, so no :P
In the grand scale of things a lot worse things happened in Cyprus during and after the war than name changes, but it still greatly offended the locals
Not all Turkish Cypriots agree with placename Turkification, and not all Greek Cypriots agree with placename Greekification (actually, being a Greek speaker, I know for a fact that most Greek Cypriots find it at least stupid, if not worse)
We are leeezeeee

That's a really good question that I should know the answer of

The communities are small, but since Cyprus is also small, they are sizeable communities
Also, fun fact: In the Republic of Cyprus, Turkish is an official language, but in the south, only 2000 people speak it
In the whole Cyprus everyone is reliant of a car
You need a car
Oh, well I will only answer about the free areas in the south but I am pretty sure the same applies for the northern occupied areas
Public transport doesn't really exist
We have buses but they aren't good enough to make people use them
Every house has at least 2 cars(each person has his own)
At the age of 17 students start driving lessons, when they start studies (if they study in Cyprus) they have to buy a car
That's our driving culture
I doubt thing are different in the northern areas
(As someone who used busses, I am 19, I have to say that the majority of people in buses where foreigners, old people and young people-without driving license-)
My parents never got into a bus(at least since I remember myself)
I can answer for the occupied North
Every Cypriot has a car, universities have their own busses, but public transport is pretty terrible and almost non existent
You won't see any Cypriot in the busses (maybe some high school students), all of the passengers are Turkish settlers and students etc
(Even the driver lol)
Yeah our roads are pretty good
Unfortunately our cities aren't bike friendly(in Limassol some genious guy responsible for the bike road did that:
I doubt that could happen in any other country (especially one that call it/herself European)
I just hope the cypriot mentality of having a nice car at 17, buying a super expensibe mercedes just to show off even if you can't afford it, considering it offensive for someone to use a bus will stop
Cycling is becoming a more popular mean of exercising, hopefully it will become a mean of transport as well(considering how small distances are)(my grandpa's generation could do it
why can't we
Haha we are the same
In a bus you will only see foreigners a high school students or some ladies going to the hospital
A big number of drivers here are Romanian/Bulgarian(but they speak greek)
Oh nice xD
I ve never been to Akamas so idk
It's nice that bike road are staryingtto become popular(hopefully they will expand-a new plab for decentralisation of the state is coming and hopefully that will give the power(politically and financially) to municipalities to develop more
Because of the occupation some places are more isolated than the rest of the country so a solution to the cypriot problem would really help everything (the town/village I live-I study in Athens now- is 35 mins from Nicosia by driving now but before the turkish invasion it was 13 mins
There are more villages like this(Pyrgos which is a small one making it super isolated)
Unfortunate yes
Even if the Cypriots agree on sth Turkey must agree
The Turkish Cypriot side relies too much on Turkey
Last week the TC leader made a post on facebook that criticised the invasion to Syria(not really criticised,he just stated the obvious thay it's blood thay it's splitting not water and that he hopes negotiations will come as soon as possible so there is peace again
Many Turkish politicians attacked him(and Turkish Cypriots-rightists mostly)
If you want more info about it check my profile I made a post about it a few days ago
The thing is that the pro-EU side did absolutely nothing and let the anti-EU voice become prominent :/
Would you say that Sweden is a pro- EU nation in general or more neutral
I'm asking because on the one hand, people when asked they are in favour in general (recent Poll that was posted here recently, for instance France is far more Eurosceptic than Sweden), on the other hand it seems that it does not want further integration, it kept the krona and it was part of the frugal 4
The only method of transport other than a car that you can find in almost all areas is a bus
and you can basically get a 10 euro card for a month of transport ti anywhere
but only with your bus company which provides you with buses only in a certain area
the other companies won't accept your card
smh
It would take us about 1,5 hours
That's Greece, basketball is not just a random sport there, it's almost as popular if not more than football
This basically describes Greek basketball
Oh I didn't realise, I was just looking at it from a Cypriot perspective, here basketball does not get that much attention, it's at the point that we watch Greek basketball instead, however chaotic it has been lately
They forgot to invite
Ah yes as a west asian country we were supposed to be the +1 of the western civilised country of Turkey filled with intellectuals that promote peace
Of course because of this they have perfect relations with bordering countries what a stabilizer, we really need Turkey in that region to hold peace both in Syria and Cyprus
Very happy that we can be +1 of Turkey
Where do I begin
* There isn't a "Greek side and a Turkish side". There's the Republic of Cyprus, recognised by the EU and UN as the legitimate government of the whole island, and there's an illegally occupied side by Turkey
* No we don't have a hard-on for Russia or Putin
* No we aren't very poor
[ The average wage for Cyprus is comparable to Spain and Italy, except we get taxed a lot less
(Do not use 'nation' as a synonym for 'sovereign state', especially with regards to countries in Europe
* Last execution: 1962
* Abolished for the crime of murder: 1983
* Abolished for all crimes, including during war time: 2002
Apparently there were some reservations for the 'during war time' part, but eventually it came to pass
There's no chance of it returning so long as Cyprus remains a member of the EU and CoE
No politician or organised political group supports bringing it back
Blogging in Cyprus is dead, Facebook killed it
Citizens can say a lot of things, especially when they are angry or deeply appealed by a crime
That doesn't translate to policy
Like in many other countries, today is Easter Monday and therefore a day off
Now, "Easter Tuesday" tomorrow is also a day off only for banks specifically
That's because in their collective agreement they traded one of the Christmas holidays for an extra day in Easter
That means that the banks will be closed from Good Friday until this Wednesday, so I sure hope my rent transfer will be processed in time
But no, when public holidays fall on the weekend, they are not moved
> There's definitely a reason why paypal and Venmo are that popular
Are they
I only know of Venmo because of American culture, and everyone I know despises Paypal for its capriciousness and high fees
We solve the problem, in Cyprus, by understanding that public holidays mean slower payments
The receiver pays them, not the sender
We had to use it to collect some money to support struggling families (without giving out personal IBAN numbers) during the lockdown last year, and we paid around 70 cents as fees for each 10 EUR received
I haven't bathed in 10 years, I only shower

So its actually worse

> In most cultures YOU were supposed to bring that for ME on MY birthday
Wow, I will never get used to this

Asking me to do work (like bring the treats or the cake) on your birthday is bizarre

Close-knit workplaces would also appreciate it if you brought some zivania]

> I remember hearing in the news that they were deemed a terrorist organization but that's just a matter of definition I guess
Sorry to insist, but it's not a matter of definition
It has important legal consequences
On one side there was the argument that it would have been harder to convict them under the anti-terrorist provision (because there's more things to prove, and if they couldn't prove them, they would walk completely free) and on the other hand the lack of the terrorism element meant that the sentences are less severe

Slightly better public transport, there's a demilitarised zone running through the middle, you have to drive more than 20 minutes to reach a beach, and the summers are more hot because it's further away from the shore

Unless it's hosted at a venue (e.g. McDonald's), yeah I don't think it's common

In school, as a way to make student aware of the differences and better prepare them to use the expected form in a given communicative context
No, it's an absolute taboo and acknowledging differences during the education praxis is considered as equivalent to attacking the prestigious standard register of the language
In academic research at university: very
Cyprus is a hotspot of linguistic research compared to the size of our academic sector
The linguistic landscape is very rich, allowing the study of many linguistic questions with regard to variation, acquisition, and social dynamics
I feel like you are a bit dramatic but yes
Cypriot Greek is not taught, however it's very much in use even in teaching, since it's the spoken variety
The only exception might be modern Greek teachers but that still depends on the teacher
Most don't have a problem with using the dialect
It's important to mention that traditional Cypriot songs can be taught in music class or for school events . Cypriot folk songs, poems and other works in Cypriot Greek are taught as part of the literature class or again for school plays/ events
However, I do agree that Cypriot Greek should be taught / analysed in class
> Do younger Cypriots resent this, or is it not really seen as an issue
There's a lot of academic literature on attitudes and I can't do it justice here, but I would cautiously say that school-aged people tend to see themselves as the problem when they therefore perform poorly on language-related tests
Any opposition to this approach comes when they are older and have found a sense of self-confidence from a different source
But that's something observed more generally in many countries: bad education systems make children feel lacking and they won't know how the system failed them for decades to come
But the issue is definitely controversial and not far from reach at any given time
The Greek speaking world has been facing so-called Language Questions for the last few centuries
Many of them have been now resolved, but the situation in Cyprus is still dynamic - Cyprus is an extremely multilingual place to begin with and Cypriot Greek is the most active of all Greek dialects and perhaps the only one that could potentially "threaten" standard Greek if there was any appetite to do that
Other Greek dialects have mostly faded
The issue is extremely political - it's hard to do science in this climate sometimes, because research findings either upset the language-unificators or the language-splitters (those who argue that Cypriot Greek is "just an accent" or "a full language" respectively)
For example, an empirical fact that metalinguistic awareness educational is beneficial for the goal of learning the standard language is disregarded by the first group because it gives value to "the accent" even though it would produce higher proficiency in the standard language, that is a goal they like
As for the splitters, they don't so much reject the science, they are more vilified than they deserve
But they try to present their goals as 100% backed by science even though a huge part of their motivation is political and should be acknowledged as such
> I feel like you are a bit dramatic but yes
Yeah, fair, I am oversimplifying a massive and very controversial topic in very few words
There are volumes upon volumes of academic articles on the topic and I can't do them justice in-between zoom classes
> Cypriot Greek is not taught, however it's very much in use even in teaching, since it's the spoken variety
True, especially in the recent decade, but importantly not in the systematic 'metalinguistic awareness' framework that was envisioned by the cancelled 2008 reform
The way it's used, as you say, is ad-hoc and completely down to the individual teacher, without any learning goals in mind
That's less threatening than giving it a proper role to serve in the classroom, even if that role is to facilitate high proficiency in the standard language (e.g. by comparison of equivalent structures and explicit comparison of the differences on all linguistic levels)
> It's important to mention that traditional Cypriot songs can be taught in music class or for school events . Cypriot folk songs, poems and other works in Cypriot Greek are taught as part of the literature class or again for school plays/ events
Yes true, that was already the case at least since the 2000s. But again here, it was always critical to make sure that Cypriot Greek wasn't elevated to the role of a means of instruction
It's okay if it's for folklore, or if it's just ad hoc colloquial use
That was rarely controversial, but the 2008 reforms were fiercely opposed because they did the unthinkable and clearly stated that the dialect is *useful* as a teaching tool
Again, I am writing all this in such a rush, simplifications abound

We do not have a name for & in Greek, although it's widely used in non-formal contexts (typically not in the body of the text, but only in short spans like headings)
I think we would spontaneously refer to it as "συντομογραφία του και" (lit
"the shorthand for and")
We also do not have a name for the Greek ampersand, "ϗ" (from "και")
The Greek ampersand is only used in handwriting, since Microsoft decided not to include it in its Greek keyboard (similarly, the Greek equivalent of the semicolon, the upper/middle dot "·" can only found in professionally typeset books and in the online comments of Linux users flexing their superior Greek keyboard layout)
Often like a [κ with a comma] merged into it
Afaik it's used in Catalan, to disambiguate two pronunciations of "ll".
I certainly removes the annoyances of AZERTY, QUERTZ and the other national Latin layouts, but it's still less convenient than using the standard US English with Compose Key enabled (I prefer to assign the Windows key as the Compose key)
And there's no way out of using a national layout if you write in Greek or one of the many languages using Cyrillic
Yeah, unlike &, ϗ has a very transparent origin
Before I ever knew about it, I was already writing και as κ/, and ϗ is a natural evolution from there
At least 4 times more

Cyprus is home to the oldest named wine still in production, "Commandaria".
Commandaria has a rich history, said to date back to the time of the ancient Greeks, where it was a popular drink at festivals celebrating the goddess Aphrodite
A dried grape wine from Cyprus was first known to be described in 800 BC by the Greek poet Hesiod and was known as the Cypriot Manna
In the 12th century, during the crusades, Richard the Lionheart is said to have enjoyed it greatly at his wedding in Cyprus and to have pronounced it “the wine of kings and the king of wines
” Near the end of the century he sold the island to the Knights Templar, who then sold it to Guy de Lusignan, but kept a large feudal estate close to Limassol to themselves
This estate was referred to as “La Grande Commanderie”. The word Commanderie referred to the military headquarters whilst Grande helped distinguish it from two smaller such command posts on the island, one close to Paphos (Phoenix) and another near Kyrenia (Templos)
This area under the control of the Knights Templar (and subsequently the Knights Hospitaller) became known as Commandaria
When the knights began producing large quantities of the wine for export to Europe’s royal courts and for supplying pilgrims en route to the holy lands, the wine assumed the name of the region
Thus it has the distinction of being the world’s oldest named wine still in production
They allow people to buy citizenship and were a former bastion of crusaders
That's all I got

M8 where i live i have had to suffer through a Sahara cloud of HOT(37°C) for the last 4 days at least where avrg May temperatures dont exceed 27°C and highest should be at most 33°C. I blame climate change and dust
Mostly dust
I mean opening the window to get some wind in the house is counterproductive
It gets HOTter
wtf
Good thing i live at 100m above sea level then
Cyprus has really good water level protection
One km inland is usually enough to not drowm in the next 20 years
They'll drown
Obviously
It's tragic that Cyprus is sunny 95%of the year and we have so little renewable energy
I don’t think 1,120 is enough to get an average for this

Never seen Cyprus so high up in a list lol
And you exiled us to the middle of freaking Balkans
Probably the only place in Europe which is not an improvement over middle east
Aw diddums
You still aren't invited into the club by the way
Sounds like you are quite upset mate
EU isn't going anywhere
You can forge a new caliphate with your TRNC vassal state and half of Syria so its not all bad for you
Cyprus STRONK
Didn't you get the memo

Guys, I am a Turkish Cypriot (an original one, not a Turkish settler) and you should know that Turkish Cypriots were really affected as well
Many TCs (Turkish Cypriots) were killed and massacred too
For example, some of my releatives were massacred in their village (Tochni) in an event known as [the Tochni Massacre]
I am not trying to justify the invasion but just wanting and hoping that you don’t only see it one sided
In the end, there are no winners of the war as both sides were affected
There was [intercommunal violence] way before the invasion like in 1950s.
Not sure if you are aware but there were two Turkish invasions
One right after the coup which was understandable and viewed positively by the international community
After the first invasion, Greek Junta collapsed and EOKA B and the coupist government in Cyprus dissolved
Then while peace talks were going on to reach a political solution, Turkey launched a second invasion which was much more devestating and resulted to the expulsion of around 200k people from north Cyprus and the occupation
The second invasion was widely condemned by everyone and this is the reason Turkey was later sanctioned and "TRNC" is not recognized by anyone
There is no comparison between Nazi Germany and Republic of Cyprus
The killings of Turkish Cypriots were not done by the republic of Cyprus but by an anti-government terrorist orginization (EOKA B)
You base that on what exactly
As long as we don't have external interference, I believe it is far more likely we live peacefully than killing each other
Damn i mossed it
What was going on
Huh
Where did I say it's ok or that we shouldn't talk about it
The OP was comparing Nazi Germans to Greek Cypriots
While the atrocities commited by Nazi Germans were approved and instigated by the Nazi government, atrocities commited against Turkish Cypriots was committed by anti-government terrorists (which killed many Greek Cypriots as well mind you)
Also a lot of Turks say that Greek Cypriot people deserved to suffer because of EOKA B actions, equating all Greek Cypriots with EOKA B. As Turks love to point that PKK =/ Kurds, EOKA B =/ Greek Cypriots
I don't see any other way we can unite except by a common agreement
> Huh
Where did I say that
I said a lot of Turks not you specifically
If you don't believe that then that's good
I just had to point it out that the atrocities were committed by terrorists that had nothing to do with the ordinary Greek Cypriot people that suffered due to the invasion
I don't see how what I said was hypocritical
same:(

Ah yes, the famous capitalist ideas for lifting people out of poverty, like mandatory minimum wage, unemployment benefits, healthcare for everyone, sick leave, vacation days
Be real, capitalists fought against all of that and still do, the threat of communist uprising held them back, but they're getting braver now that USSR isn't around to sponsor everyone vaguely communist
Slovakia ?
I mean I wouldn’t had they not destroyed my country
Ok then, No Erdogan, you can not have Cyprus
Ok facist
Maximum Speed Limits on European Motorways and Highways
Maximum Speed Limits on European Motorways
**By *@nerdy maps*, follow his instagram acc (if you have one)**
This is the second map from that amazing guy that I reposted(I only did it because he encourages and thanks people who do that)
Netherlands changed the law in March and is now 100 (except some night hours that is higher)
There is a chance there is something wrong with Belarus but apparently with all that's going on there not many people said anything (Stay strong Belarusian People, Fight for Democracy)
**The map is in km/h**
In cyprus whatever the speed limit is everyone goes 19km over
Police usually dosnt stop you for that but if you go 20km over they pull you over and fine you for all 20km gone above the limit
Its an unspoken rule or atleast thats what my mom says
Hope its not just her excuse for speeding lmao
I don't see you posting your amazing maps though:)
In your posts you thank for repost :(
People loved this one:))
You have the 20% rule too
You will jump in the island next to Malta(Malta as a country is more than one island:)
I think in Cyprus you can drive up to 20%-1 higher of the speed limit without having problems (so 119)
I thought you were allowed up to 20% minus 1
So the max is 119
True
I didn't make the map but the guy who did used one sign for countries that are adjacent and have the same speed level so the map was not just small circles of the same speed limits (Portugal-Spain, Eastern-Central Europe etc)
Many pissed Portuguese, Czechs and Austrians <3
No highways right
Good
That was a shock for me too (does it have anything to do with Mediterranean
Lol
Yeah xD
And Yugoslavia is back together :P
Check Eastern-Central Europe:)
Yeah, that's what I know as well
The limit is 100 but you are safe to go up to 119
We have UK
A Russian user said are allowed to exceed that by 20 km I think
It was changed recently
I think in night it's 120 or 130
It's kinda obvious since all Europe use km/h(these are the signs used in the street and they also don't say it) except UK and for UK it says mph
Did they change it since sources online say 130
Well the official limit is 130
In Cyprus for example the official limit is 100 but you don't get a ticket if you go up to +20% -1 so you can drive up to 119
But it's still 100
The majority of accidents here happen from people going super fast not super slow (and we have a pretty high number of accidents)
I mean these are the maximum maximum speed limits
You can't drive in all roads with his speeds(not just in Germany)
112km/h=70mhp is enough with some maths
Careful though, don't break the bubble :P
Yeah I read that the moment I check your profile:)
Omg(I am studying uni maths right now)
Here it's 20% minus one (so 119)
I know bruh ;)
Hm okay
I kinda confuse left and right so I thought left was right:)
Some old signs in my country, Cyprus, still say miles
Oh I see
There is usually a minimum limit though
/r/mapswithoutcyprus
We have several non indo-European languages there
why even let non-EU companies to participate in the first place
45 years have passed and Turkey is still illegally occupying Cyprus' territory
Whats with that dumb title most modern city in netherlands
You could have atleast said halki, naxos island, greece
Lol yeah exploring the islands was much better than the storyline haha
[No its not] [2] (the car is not definetly)
I love how occupied Greece refused to vote yes, knowing that there could be reprisals
Both sides knew how *democracy* works way before the election/referendum date
One side was smarter & knew how to get more votes
Other side instead of accepting defeat, thinks of irrelevant excuses
Same old pattern ..

Well I’m terrified:)
Turkey is a big player in this war and is constanlty proving that is the biggest troublemaker in the whole region, but still, EU refuses to sanction them
This is a repost, original in r/MapPorn
and this happens after France went on high alert
It shouldn't have happened
I agree but it could have been a lot worse without them
Suckers
Same here in Cyprus, and it sucks
Haters will say it’s fake
Oh hi Turkey
The blue jeans are a dead giveaway
So yeh I am studying in Scotland and a friend who is from just south of the border is paying 9k while i pay nothing
Ahem
Same, I had no idea
Russia, USA, China, Japan, NK's attempts, then Australia does some sattelite stuff
Figured the UK might have something related
But no idea we had an ESA
I have seen it in Manchester airport too
It was 38° at my school in Cyprus
we dont have ACs or fans
Haha that chart for Cyprus is bullshit
We recorded 45C this month
Why do you have jail bars on the windows
Is there any thought being spent on the Cyprus situation, from this opposition
Cyprus has been quite isolated from drastically different races up until the 70s. Also huge rivalries with Muslims, a sense of anti-semitism probably due to the 7 day war and stuff
Old families had ties in Lebanon during the golden years
If you are not used to your neighbour being different from you, then it is much harder to let them into your house
I'm sure there are records on who voted for what yes
&#x200B;
I'd like the names so as to not vote for their party ever again
Where is Cyprus

It's strange that on the one hand Erdogan says he wants to strengthen Turkey's ties with Europe and then does this
Unspeakable
He should step down

Anyone wanna help me out
Wake up

See massive turkish flag painted on a mountain as if rubbing in the occupation, not to mention spoiling the view

You are being a bit overdramatic, you could have phrased that much better now people will think you are a dickhead
Yes I am not saying you are wrong but if you wanted to convince people you don't need to be that agressive in this situation since almost everyone would understand your point and thats why there is no need to be aggresive about it, being agressive would not convince people that well instead they would show agressiveness towards you ignoring your initial point
Thank you for your rude comment very interesting indeed
I mean I doubt this message will reach your average chinese tourists, he's message is reaching people that already did not do any damage to the fields (probably) so bassically being agressive towards people that are either did not know about it or people that were already aware of this not to people actually damaging the fields
I did not call anyone a dickhead, You are using quatation marks on things I never said just to make a point, There is no argument there to be wrong or correct he is just saying I am "the only dick" here which is something I never said I did not call him a dickhead I just called his approach agressive which could result in people having an agressive response to his statement meaning they will think of him as an dickhead
&#x200B;
Grow up
what
you are putting me in a inferior position as (immature) just to justify your stand
dissapointing
It is assuming that everyone that goes there would destroy the fields even if it is respectable guy, think of it like this someone was planing t to visit a country and someone from that country would say if you are planing to come here don't you are filthy and throw trash everywhere I know its not the same level its about how you take it since its subjective but it is in the same cagtegory with this example, instead he could just raised awareness about the issue by saying people go there and do this which casues
so be careful if you plan to visit
I understand, its just how it subejctivly appeared to be and thought some people might think like that and get offended/respond negatively (I did not)
Thank you for giving a detailed and proper reply instead of just calling me cunt

Yeah i'm gonna have to totally disagree with the Cyprus part :P Most people get between 800-1000
