I dont know what it is but I cant imagine life in the Romanian undergound
I live in Osaka, lived in tokyo, been to london and Paris (worst subway in the world) but I cant imagine bucharests subway and my girlfriend from Romania has never been on it because she is from Caraș-Severin
Like whats the smell like
Gates
Tickets
Any shops or restuaraunts
What are the exits like, convieniant or crap
Thanks thats amazing and yeah car is king in romania but I couldnt picture romanian subway I spent 2 months there mostly in resita but also into transylvania and as you likely already know funding isnt booming
I think overall Romania looks a million times better as people percieve it, sure its not rich but I never felt like it was poor
Yeah those about 3000 romanians in the whole of Japan
We have heard a few romanian tourists which shocked her
They sell socata fanta here, cabage rolls and romanian wine
Theres a bar near us run by a Japanese guy that has a massive romanian flag outside and sells romanian wine and good
We havent been in so dont know why yet
Japonia fever is popular and yeah you could make it here, she did
They hired her as a native english teacher lol
At her school they put up romanian flags and stickers and stuff for the kids
Thered quite a few romanians here that I know of and vice versa I know Japanese people that went to work in Romania
An expression involving a city from another country (that I haven't seen mentioned yet here by other Dutch people): People use "*van hier tot Tokio*" (from here to Tokyo) when something is long/far
E.g. "*Er staat een rij van hier tot Tokio*." (There's a line from here to Tokyo
) when there is a long queue
Also, yes the irony, I actually live near Tokyo now, so the expression doesn't work for me here like it would if I were still in the Netherlands
theres such a massive contrast between slough and windsor
Ones a pretty town with a great Castle
The others a big ugly industrial block
Yeah I moved to Japan, why
Im from Britain and the quality of life is not even close
The normans where neither french or English they where simply norman because as you say there was no centralization or even unity
They where more scandi than anything, they where only in Normandy  100 years or so before invading England
They where no more french than the turks where byzantine
Feudal France is closer akin to modern day Britain than modern day France in that Scottish/Welsh/English/Irish are British but not English whereas back then Normans where French subjects but not French
Because for the last thousand years weve been labeling small groups minorities
Ethnically they where normans-northman-norse or in other words scandinavian, culturally how every they assimilated into the French culture at the time
Today we have people who are born in another country referring to themselves as their families native countries
Chinese communities in America, Jamaican communities in Britain, muslim communities in Europe, indian communities how are the normans any different
In Lancashire England we spend get pics taken in old steel and cotton mills, we often pay kids to pretend to be child workers and we cover her dress in black dirt
Told my girlfriend Just cant do these, though I want the little crowns
No, but I’ve had it happen the other way around
I was trying to get money from the ATM at the airport in Japan, but had issues with withdrawing money, and this guy waiting in line behind me started to complain in Dutch to his wife that I was taking long
I turned around and responded to him in Dutch that the ATM wasn’t working properly
Only if you dont include liiykm̀m̀a
Dutch, English, French, German, Swedish, and Spanish
These were the ones I could remember from the top of my head
Not so much to flex, but I guess now I can learn some new ones through the other comments
I think theres an age gap here
The intention of the majority of young people is to get absolutely wrecked and off your face
In fact the majority of people in most pubs get pissed
Yeah id never have thought clitheroe was rude due to how its pronounced
I thought Britain wanted more
In the congress of Berlin Britain worked hard to get Romania independent away from the Ottomans and wanted more to prevent Russian expansion
From what I remember of the 1856 treaty the target was Russia
Russia had to give territory back to Moldavia and the Romanian principlaties where given greater independence
This was during Britain and Russias great game so Britain would do anything to upset Russia
Like German people who learned Turkish or there is a population there of Turkish who have German ancestors
How about Béla Ⅳ?
Corvin castle
Peles castle
Bran castle
Spikey chair in bran castle
Rock face on danube
Big tower with clock on in sighisaora
The abandoned casino in constanta
Guess it will give contestants on asia express something else to shout about when begging for a drive
"Pls biggest reality tv show in europe, pls we are always last, pls biggest cathedral in europe" *screams in romanian and puts hand on foreheard in frustration*
How do you curb tourism
Sounds hard to stop
Do places as famous as Venice do advertising campaigns
Samarle in Romania, had it at my girlfriends and was surprised it was so good
Also papanasi because sour cream on a desert didnt sound right
I had both nutella covered papanasi and the traditional berry jam and sour cream and damn the traditional one was by far the best
Best desert I think ive ever had
The samarle was a surprise didnt look good vut tasted fantastic
Balkans is full of incredible food
Maybe in the future more Balkan national restuaraunts will befome famous like greek restaurants
Am I the only one that prefers many of the ads and billboards
Like having them in the way of windows and on apartments is ridiculous but I feel like the colour can add a lot to a city and is convenient when trying to find a business
I live in Japan so perhaps my view is skewed
Whatto
Nice fucking job France
You join the likes of Greece, Austria, Finland, Netherlands and Germany in showing the world right wing populism isn't the way to go
Good fucking job
Protestants
Wow that’s a lot of people in Northern Africa
Is Earthquake usual thing in Croatia
I mean, basically earthquake happens only in the particular areas
*Loud engine noise in the background*
"Nice try England
*bombs away*
Why is the UK seen as the hostile country
There’s even still the witch living inside
Very well preserved indeed
The rounded residence looks very futuristic
I know that in the city Rotterdam they have underground toilets on the night out days
So you won't see them during the day and at night they go up near cafés and bars
Then this awful state in this world won’t change in 2001
And after that, WW3
It’s not so bad
This sub Reddit has such an unhealthy obsession with old European buildings and hating on anything modern
This building is great it covers two separate and popular styles of architecture found in Europe and so it’s fitting that it’s the headquarters of architecture in Romania
The building was ruined during the revolution and I think this is a great idea in breathing life into the building
Copyright/patent laws are the most retarded thing human kind have ever invented in the history of mankind
EVER
nose
We want the reverse of what is going to happen, yet we still aim to master the water
As well as authoritarianism and democracy
Practicing social distancing before it was a thing
No wonder people cba to go vote nowadays
Edit: I kind of expressed it wrong
I meant to say people nowadays are too lazy(Maybe Netherlands was a bad example) to go to vote that's why the turnout is lower than in the past
Heres your daily propganda post of Britain bad Ireland good
The daily bash Britain post with all its misinformation of the ottoman relief fleet that didnt exist the fake story of the Sultan wanting to donate more, the lies about how britons did nothing and infact engineered it as if it wasnt exasperated by the economic model
Like anyone gives a shit about historical fact on this subreddit its just all EU good Britain bad America bad Russia bad
No one, the 1989 Romanian revolution was an orchestrated coup
Romanian military prosecutors indicated as such
Did your aunt lose her job when Monarch Airlines went bankrupt in 2017
Kurwa
Ah the religion of pea
Oh, wait
Why Asian can't get so much ; ;
See you in two years
