Basically everything to do with the First Nations/Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
Mostly the stolen generations but there was a whole lot more fucked up shit
Wait really
I didn't know other countries even cared about Australian history, that's very interesting, we don't even learn that much about it in school
Thank you for telling me this
I've never heard of the language tests with accents before, that's cool
And yes, the Royal Flying Doctor service is touched on briefly in Australian schools
The RCMP is Canadian though, not Australian
(It stands for Royal Canadian Mounted Police I believe
That'll be the day
Giovanni Gentile Probably had a bigger role doctrinally
But Mussolini carried it through to power
This is based on what I was taught and what I saw whilst doing volunteer work for a charity called "Save the Children" in Kununurra, Western Australia
This is an example of the cycle of poverty among Aboriginal communities in Australia that began with the "Stolen Generation", they were the Aboriginal children who were stolen from their families to be brought up in "missions" where they were taught essentially how to be like white people
It was awful, and it caused problems that are still faced today in Aboriginal communities such as depression
The depression leads to alcoholism, the alcoholism leads to crime and so on
You are a young Aboriginal boy, around 9 or 10, who lives in a tiny town in Western Australia, out in the desert
You live in a crumbling, trashed home with your alcoholic mother and your father is in jail
Due to your mother's alcoholism, home isn't safe, and you have been suspended from school
It's not like you were learning anything there anyway because you always got in trouble
Instead of school or home, you decide to go play with your mates like you have done for weeks now, still wearing the same clothes as last week, unwashed
Your mates have found something fun to do today, it's called stealing
This is your first encounter with the police, the first of many
A couple years later, you end up in juvenile prison, it's an awful place, you are treated horribly
You are released from juvenile prison, and not long after you end up there again
Between your sentences, you've grown up, found a lovely girlfriend, but all those years of missing out on school meant you have no education and therefore no job
All your money comes from Centrelink, a government service that provides money to those who need it
Your girlfriend gives birth to a son, but it's difficult to raise a child when you have little to no money, much of it spent on you and your girlfriends alcohol addiction which you got after trying "just a little bit" with your mates when you were just young teens
In order to survive, you steal again, and get caught again
You are sent to prison with your alcoholic girlfriend at home with your son
Your son is an Aboriginal boy, around 9 or 10, who lives in a tiny town in Western Australia, out in the desert
Save the Children is a charity that runs centres in towns with high poverty rates in Australia, they give children a safe place to play and be educated
The kids I worked with were just like any other, great kids, and it's awful that they have to live like they do
I hope that the children of the children I worked with will grow up in a new Australia where charities like "Save The Children" won't have to exist
This is the most poetic thing I’ve ever read on Reddit
Makings of modern Tolstoy:
“This man can go around calling Putin swine all day long
Nothing will change in his life
Which is horrible enough”.
Accept my poor man’s gold
damn that’s interesting
Be proud of your accents
It’s a super endearing part of who you are
If I hear a non-native accent it just makes me wanna talk to you more
Native speakers who struggle to understand a foreign accent usually have never travelled, or have poor listening skills
We make fun of every accent
I personally dislike my own accent
It is far too American for my liking
At least you don’t get congratulated on speaking your native language like me and a couple of my mates have been lmao
English natives don't care because we all have accents
Whereas it is a generic Mid west American Accent or something funky like the Jamaican Accent, we are all used to natives speaking English differently
So when it comes to non natives, we like to hear the accent but also we need to be able to understand you though lmao
Eh I lived in Italy for a year,  I actually reckon that Northern Italians have have different accent
Rather than sounding like Mario they’re accent seemed to have more bass
Dunno how to describe it but yeah there is definitely a regional difference
On another note I had a lot of trouble understanding the Sicilian accent when I was learning Italiano
What I mean is that it sounds like you guys use the back of you throat and seem to have your tongue lower when you start a sentence
Although maybe it just the Genovese that are weird lmao
It’s been so long since I’ve last been in Italy
Agreed
I watched the Dutch YouTuber NikkieTutorials for an embarrassingly long time before I realised she was not actually American
The younger generation seem to be very good at masking their accent
and I assume the German accent played a hand in the formation of the American accent
Samsung is superior
Europeans like quality
Americans buy what they're told to
I enjoyed Naples, probably because I was expecting the worst but was pleasantly surprised by the decayed charm of the place
And I still dream of the pizza there
Are both worse than Leeds
Genuinely curious
I've around the UK a bit, and for some reason Leeds stood out as a dump more than others
"Is that so
Let me just check the database
no, it seems service 1F43 was within 1 minute of schedule
We would be the guy from another office that nobody really knows but shows up at parties anyway
Britain is probably the guy who’s threatened to quit 3 years ago and is standing by the door trying to renegotiate their exit terms while everyone else is staring at them waiting for them to sign the document
Poland would be the hot receptionist that everybody in the office wants
The Balkans are the people who always argue in the break room

"The windows here, they only open or close

How do these people live
My "regions" are bigger than the average
Same in Australia- I'm living in Germany, and I can't quite wrap my head around the "du" and "Sie" usage - I understand it in a theoretical way, I just can't seem to put it into practice
And to think that by Australian standards, Americans are quite formal with all that sorta stuff
You'd lose your sh*t here
It's very rare to call someone anything other than their first name, even children call adults by first name (unless it's a teacher)
Yeah, that's very normal here
The level of formality of some countries is kinda weird/uncomfortable for us
I find it very old fashioned, but at the same time I respect other cultures' customs
I've heard Germany in particular is quite formal with the titles/names thing
13 year old neo Nazis
What the hell is going on
I don't know much about Estonian law but I would assume it's much easier to get a gun in America
Correction: I don't know ANYTHING about Estonian law

The numerous disasters that have occurred in the past 3 months are not a result of climate change/Climate change isn't real/Climate Change isn't a man made disaster and there is no way to stop it
Same here
The devastating fires we had, followed immediately by the torrential floods
A false flag operation started by the Greens (environmentalist party) to make it look like climate change was real
Or simply hand waved away because “Australia’s always been like this
Nothing new
There have been some half hearted threats of it, but there are too many protesters for one thing, and it’s not going to achieve Jack shit for another
"Hello There" - English
"Sup Cunt" - Australian English
Is there a rule for which adjectives go where
I was already an adult when I learnt that our adjectives went in a certain order in English
Lol no it's not
I find the Dutch/German structure truely bizarre
But cool at the same time
This is how English was written 500 years ago
Sounds to me like Shakespeare
Dutch and German have weird sentence structures (for English-speakers)
English and French sentence structures are almost identical
Tinnie/Tinny is also a small boat haha
What
They're talking about French
They mentioned in their comment that some adjectives come before
I've noticed it in words like "bon" and "petite" and thought they might know why
It is certainly interesting
I'm not sure if English would have been mutually intelligible with Dutch or German, even if it wasn't influenced by French
Languages that developed on islands usually suffered the 'island effect', but who knows (just look at how different Icelandic is vs the other Scandinavian languages)
I like the German and Dutch languages, but I think I still prefer the (modern) English word order and structure (sorry
But that's probably just because that's what I'm used to
It just sounds so 'old timey' to me
And saying Shakespeare was Dutch is still a hangable offence in the UK ;)
I do wonder if over time, Dutch and German will start to more resemble English in this regard though
Jesus Christ where do I begin with Scomo
Scott Morrison is Australia's current prime Minister, he was voted in by all the boomers who's only response to criticism is "Lay off Scomo
He's doing the best he can
Let's go back and have a look at his stupidity:
During the Australian bushfire crisis a few months back, Scott Morrison did these things:
- Cut the budget of the Rural Fire Service by $50000 AUD
- Sold a shit ton of water to shady Chinese companies in the middle of drought season
- Visited a couple of fire affected towns so he would look good in the media which absolutely fucking backfired because he was shockingly rude to people and physically forced a woman to shake his hand when she refused his offer to
- And last but certainly not least: ***TOOK A FUCKING HOLIDAY TO HAWAII IN THE MIDDLE OF A NATIONAL EMERGENCY***
Thankfully he hasn't repeated much of this bullshit with the new national emergency, but he did attempt to delay the shutting down of schools and etc but was forced to anyway
I think people understand that the little classrooms you see in the ads aren't private schools in the suburbs
A lot of the poverty these charities aim to help with is rural
They want to put wells in villages that don't have reliable clean water, offer food to subsistence farmers affected by drought, distribute vaccines to communities that don't have reliable access to health care
Yes the life of middle and even urban working class people isn't depicted by charities
It's a pity we don't get to see what life looks like for so many people and we should make an effort to seek out their stories
But even in developing economies full of opportunity let's not pretend everything is fine
Botswana is doing great economically but has a massive HIV crisis and a poverty rate around 10%.
In my industry it's amazing the difference between farms in Columbia and in Ethiopia, for example
One is hundreds of acres of carefully groomed and pruned trees and educated farmers who understand the global market and may even process their own product in cooperation with international distributors or even the end client on a different continent, the other is about 5 acres of untouched trees, you pick the product, take it to market and get the price of the day
The level of education and power available to a farmer varies wildly
It's mostly Asian kids here in Australia, but there's normally at least one token shot of some smiling African kids in front of some running water
Is it related to “Spumante” the sparkling wine
I wish we had winter in the first place
OMG same here
TWINSIES
Oh yeah
my favourite is seeing commercial where a family sits down to a nice traditional Christmas dinner, with a baked ham and winter comfort foods
It's like like 35 on Christmas day
I'm not baking anything in an oven
i have a cousin from germany who lives right on the swiss border, and yeah some swiss people treat germans like how (for example) some people treat chinese tourists
Please provide more details about the jokes
We must catalog them for our archives
We take such matters very seriously
“The grass is always greener on the other side” is the saying we have in English
Trenitalia isn’t too bad and they’re generally on time from my memory,  but it was always a toss up on what platform the train would arrive at lmao
There is a Dutch ice cream chain called Australian ice cream
I think they make chocolate too
Not Australian
I always thought tiramisu was Japanese, just because it sounds so much like a Japanese word
There's a small chain of premium ice cream stores in Australia called "Royal Copenhagen", I don't know why they're called that but it's some of the best ice cream I've ever had
Another Danish ice cream association
Nah there's none in Victoria, which is a shame
Most of their locations as far as I remember are Queensland, NSW and South Australia
In Sydney there's one right in Circular Quay and another not too far away
Try putting it in a jug in the fridge
Much of the chemical smell disappears in a day or less
Until this very moment, I had always thought 'avocado' was a Spanish word lol
Edit: just found out it comes from Nahuatl ahuacatl, which was then aguacate in Spanish
English borrowed the word from Spanish, but changed the sound and spelling of the word
even in the netherlands
So how did people say that before English
Seems a weird thing to not have in a language
Ah, gotcha
In many languages, the official name for the country is some form of 'Holland'.
Stand in the bicycle lanes
It's normal in many countries
You'll hear both forms here, although I feel like The Netherlands is starting to become more common now
If they're tight enough, your voice can sing a few octaves higher
Great answer
People everywhere are just different
Doesn't mean they're rude
It wouldn't happen here either
That would be considered being rude to the customer, which is a no no (unless provoked of course)
Super interested how they do fines for Non EU Tourists
EG, Asia, Oceania etc driving on international licenses
It really got to me with Incubus (1966)
Shatner was just the worst
Australian here
I remember when I moved to Norway and started saying G’day to people on the bus and at the gym
They were horrified and I think I caused some people to have a heart attack from the anxiety of it all
Isn't this to do with the Iberian peninsula's time zone offset from the solar day though
Moved from the uk, with its official limit of 112 km/h and effective limit of 135 km/h, to Australia where speed hysteria never really evolved into the more nuanced road policing approach, 100 km/h limit on motorways except for some glorious sections of 110 km/h, and god help you if you're more than 10 km/h over the limit
It's insane, as the quality of driving is really poor despite this, but the connection hasn't been made by those in power yet
I like [these bus ones]
Merry Christmas from Kangaroo land
Don't know if other English speaking countries use this but in Australia, a "Dutch Oven" is when you fart under a blanket or in a sleeping bag and trap the smell in there
>We do still sometimes use French kiss for a kiss with tongues but it's rare
In Australia I think 'french kissing' would be the most common term
'toung kissing' sounds revolting to me tbh
Unsure, I've always used it for just trapping it
Haha, I see, well I guess Google has proven that I'm incorrect
Never been evil enough to try a real Dutch oven though
Thankyou for this insight
Oh I see, I assume that must have been a traumatic experience
You can add a second flag to your flair by going into the user flair menu on the front page of the subreddit and clicking Edit flair in the top right corner (assuming you're on mobile) you'll then be able to make a custom flair, for example:
:flag_au: / :flag_nw:
Assuming AU gives you the Australian flag and not the Austrian one, in which case it might be AS
You'll end up being a shelf stocker at a supermarket
Australia has its own policy when it comes to foreigners
I'm not supposed to tell you all this but here it goes:
When a foreigner asks something dumb, for example "Do you guys ride kangaroos to school
" ALWAYS go along with it, our favourite past time is feeding tourists bullshit
I'm sure many of you have seen the video of the Scottish reporter who was convinced she was holding a "drop bear".
I think it's a council regarding the French language
They decide if a new word is worthy of being added to the dictionary
Essentially the gatekeepers of French
Most probably yes, sharpen the tip of the hat and it will impale the drop bear when it drops into your head from the trees
Asian restaurant in Berlin
"Nudelsalat mit Krebsfleisch"
"Noodle salad with cancer flesh"
"Backsack" would surely a good compromise, but it's two-thirds of the way to a male body hair removal procedure
As an Australian, reading this thread is quite amusing and highlights the difference in climates and housing design
Thinking back to when I was in Paris on a 30 degree day, it did feel like a 35+ day in Sydney
40 degrees is not uncommon even in Melbourne (which is one of the furthest Australian cities from the equator)
It’s so cute when the UK has a little ‘heatwave’ and y’all dying and it’s like 28 degrees
> nearly 40C
Hahah, I wish we had the European definition of a heatwave
Don’t you guys have fly screens
New Caledonia is a fantastic example
French territory in close proximity to Australia and New Zealand, but they still import all of their products from mainland France
Often at great expense due to existing trade agreements that they’re unable to break
For the UK: the ability to assess the value of any car and ascribe a social status in the hierarchy to the driver
They need to do what the Belgians did with their anthem - a version of lyrics in each of the three languages, plus a combined one that can be sung in major events:
>O dierbaar België, O heilig land der Vaad'ren,
Onze ziel en ons hart zijn u gewijd
>À toi notre sang, ô Patrie !
Nous le jurons tous, tu vivras !
>So blühe froh in voller Schöne,
zu der die Freiheit Dich erzog,
> Und fortan singen Deine Söhne:
Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté !
>Het woord getrouw, dat g' onbevreesd moogt spreken,
Voor Vorst, voor Vrijheid en voor Recht
Gesetz und König und die Freiheit hoch
Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté !
Yes I’ve heard that quite a few times while watching the rugby, it’s great
Saw the WC final in a pub in Ghent that was full of saffers, was pretty impressive to hear
Rugby countries often have fantastic anthems, particularly SA, Scotland, France and the king of them all, NZ
Pretty embarrassing to hear our uninspiring little thing when the wallabies are playing — but it could be worse, we could be Irish
"We have one, don't know what it says , but if we encounter a problem well take a look at it"
-Jim Jefferies
"WHEREAS the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and under the Constitution hereby established:"
This was written in 1900, and the states listed there do not include the Australian Capital Territory or Northern Territory because they are not classified as states (also back then NT didn't exist, instead there was Central Australia)
Australia is still a constitutional monarchy unfortunately
Also, I'm not to sure if this is the first "article" as such because the [constitutions website] doesn't list them as articles
If that isn't the article you were looking for then this certainly is:
"This Act may be cited as the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act
My partner & I stayed at an Airbnb in Barcelona, sharing the house with the owner
In the morning, I went to the kitchen which was right next to the master bedroom where the owners were sleeping
They left the bedroom door open and I could see them both lying in the bed with their shirts off staring at me
They were a gay couple
Was funny
My Chinese sister in law got asked if she was German a lot when she visited Greece
Germans get around so it's as good a place as any to start I guess
it's part of yiayia's genetic memory and she thinks everyone else is nuts for not knowing about it
When people think of Australian history they think of Gallipoli or Ned Kelly
An event we're all taught about in school is the Eureka revolution
During the Victorian gold rush a bunch of miner were pissed that they needed a license to mine so they built a fort, made their own flag and basically told the British government to fuck off
Then they all got shot and nothing much else really happened and now the flag is used by right wing fascist polotical parties despite the Eureka Stockade being a left wing movement
Oh yeah that to
Once a fortnight
New Zealand takes the prize
Then Australia was 2nd
i think monaco would be good
Idk some fake Eastern-European city that’s an abomination of Night City and Moscow
Harder to sneak *out* of East Germany into West Berlin
Starting level vehicle - bicycle
Elite level vehicle - Trabant (unless you make it to Political level, then you get upgraded to a Volvo)
Or make your own hot air balloon
West Berlin had a selection
Over the wall - not so much
Not in a financial sense but if you go to Australia expecting to see wild deadly animals, you won't. You may see some, but they are rare, you'll definitely see some pretty birds and kangaroos but if you want to see anything else, go to a zoo
The big banana,  The big lobster, just Victoria in general
I went to Kaunas once backpacking and hitchhiking with a friend
When we arrived we were lost and couldn't find our way or contact who we needed to
We stopped a guy on the street who spoke in a tone that sounded like we ruined his day, but went the extra mile in helping us get where we needed to go, and even checked up on us later to make sure everything was alright
An act of kindness like that goes a long way to making positive memories in a place and I have good memories in Lithuania
I actually went there my second time in Dublin
I was expecting it to be awful but it was actually alright
They just take you through atmospheric themed rooms while speaking about Irish mythology and legend
Not a mind blowing experience, but fun
They also make sure people understand it isn't a typical museum set up before they pay
Peleş is wonderful
I did a daytrip there from Bucurest
The telegondola Sinaia was also something I'll never forget
Beginning as a colourful autumn day at the bottom and ascending into snowy winter at the top
The vin fiert in lodge capped off an already perfect experience
Croke Park was one of my favourite things in Dublin
Also the Easter Rising exhibition at the GPO is worth a shout for people that enjoy history
Brunost is the fucking best
I started buying it here in Australia as well since I came back
Only one brand (Ski Queen) though and an organic food store in my city
Better than nothing though
Nothing better than brunost with strawberry jam on toast
God I love it so much
I have to admit, I was expecting that "grey, dreary, post-soviet industrial cityscape" that films always seem to portray Poland as
But it was absolutely lovely, and I've been back to visit more often
Are you talking about the original film shot in the 1970s? Because that was filmed in Munich of all places
The movie with Johnny Depp (nice German name)
no idea
His mum's Basque stew is 50% cheese

New Zealand used to be part of Australia at one point
So did Papua New Guinea but we don't have banter with them
Was Germany’s claim on Alsace-Lorraine removed after WW2, or does Germany still claim its former lands like Eastern Pomerania and Silesia
Germany can't even expand anywhere
Remember when they tried going through Belgium or Poland
So, Germany has no claims legally
Nah, France would want its former glory returned
Does Germany have any claims or have they been claimless
I guess I play too much HOI4 or EU4
Australian media hasn't covered much, if at all (Fuck you Murdoch) The only reason I know it's even happening is because Google keeps recommending me articles about it because I did a bunch of research about the country for an English project and now thinks I'm some sort of Belarus enthusiast
Kind of an off topic question but does Rupert Murdoch control most of the big media companies in New Zealand like he does in Australia
I see, fair enough
Definitely much better than Murdoch
Tipping
Why am I obligated to pay 20% of the meal cost to the server
Shouldn’t the restaurant owner be paying them a fair wage
In Australia there is only a tip jar at the counter when you pay
Tipping is rare here

Wait, what's this Donald duck episode
Perth, it's the second most isolated city in the world (1st is Hawaii), and the 1st most isolated on land
Lovely city
I was only there for one night last week, but I'd happily go back to explore more
I went to Olsztyn and really enjoyed it
Close to nature and the big lake, the castle where Copernicus worked etc
Nice part of the country imo
I also thought Katowice had a bit of rugged charm and thought the Silesian museum there was fantastic
Germany or France
ditto
Was in a lift with two ladies from former Yugoslavia speaking in their own language, didn't think much of it as that's pretty normal in Australia
Lots of immigrants and visitors from all over the world
As we were getting out of the lift my boyfriend turned to me and loudly explained what they were saying about me
All compliments, luckily
They were surprised that someone so tall could still be so cute (in their language cute very much is associated with little, apparently)
Now I know about 2 words of Serbo-Croatian
It doesn't often come in handy
Was with my boyfriend in Austria and received some not very nice words
Jokes on them, I know German, and smiled st them and kissed my boyfriend to piss them off
lol that's brilliant
I'm not still with that guy thank goodness, but one always stumbles across people who speak the language and now I know one phrase
Hello mate
Australian here in Norway
Don’t take Melbourne for granted
To be honest, 13-17c daily maximums in winter sounds pretty awesome once you’ve lived in the north of Europe for five years
It’s Spring here now in Oslo and although we’ve had some nice weather, the average day is around 10-11c and it’s cloudy as hell
I had summers in Denmark where the weather topped out at 17
Sure, the days are long but unless you want to layer up, it’s still not much fun outside unless there’s a real heat wave because the nights are almost always cold
And then winter comes
Sun comes up at 10am and goes down again at 3pm
By comparison, Melbourne climate is terrific
8-9 months of beach weather
I would be down swimming at Brighton beach from late September, early October, right up until May
Just try and get yourself a Europe holiday every July and August and then you enjoy the best of both worlds
But yeah, go to central or south of Europe if you want to have the guarantee of nice weather
Canberran here, just checking in to sympathise deeply
Winter makes me deeply miserable
I’m going to look at the advice some of the people in this thread have provided about summer-lamps and what not
I mean there’s only so often I can rug up with a cup of hot milo and tell myself “well isn’t this fucking comfy” while trying not to cry lol
Also its been 20 degrees celsius all week and I’m getting around in a t shirt
It’s perfect autumn weather
Sun’s out, Guinness out
It’s the extremes of temperature in Melbourne that mean you don’t often feel comfortable
Summer days over 40 and winter days around 12 but with an icy wind
The shoulder seasons really are the best
And there are spiders and snakes everywhere
Everything wants to kill you in Australia - weather, flora, and fauna
Late but not that many people smoke and there's definitely a stigma against it
There's also a lot of places you can't smoke like in basically all public buildings like shops, pubs, restaurants, government buildings; there's  huge stigma against smoking in the house especially if you rent and outside most buildings you have to be a certain distance from the door to smoke
Good rule of thumb is you can only smoke outdoors
Worth noting that the lower income people are more likely to smoke and tradies (tradespeople like builders, electricians etc)
Current daily smoking rate is:
*  Males: 18+ 12
8% 14+ 12
* Females: 18+ 10
4% 14+ 9
Ex smoking rate:
*  Males: 18+ 26
*  Females: 18+  21
Never smoked:
*  Males:  18+ 56
7% 14+ 59%
* Females: 18+ 65
4% 14+  67
How much are they raising the prices by
I was living in Denmark around 2 years ago (from Australia) and was shocked at how cheap cigarettes could be compared to Australia where 1 packet is around AUD$35 or about 160DKK
Yeah they're taxed to high heavens in a bid to discourage smoking
I'm indifferent to it because smoking is disgusting
My only vague concern is that it's mostly those with less income who smoke so it's a poor tax on cancer sticks
Pretty sure it's higher than that, the more popular brands are around $35-ish
I don't smoke though so I couldn't give you exact prices
Yeah I thought I remembered it being around the 50 kr mark
Good that they’re starting to increase it though, I was so shocked at how many people smoked when I lived there
>Even the Amish buy Dutch horses
But isn't that because the Amish are Dutch originally
Or is that just a name
You guys aren't falling for that again hey
Doesn't it have the most pubs per capita in Scotland as well
That blew me away when I had chemo was how much medical equipment had "Made in Ireland" on it
Spices don't always come from places you colonise
What did we give you
I see, odd to call them Dutch then
That's not a spice
Yeah right
Pronunciation eh
Can I just add from another side of the world here; googling (or facebooking you, whatever) I can understand but to be so direct about it in conversation, and on passing with others present especially on a topic like you’ve mentioned is quite the faux pas
That’s not being “honest” or “blunt”, that’s just rude
I spent my time in Germany amongst other foreign lands and I know exactly how you would have felt
I’ve been in those situations myself
For me, I took issue with the ones who chose not to see anything wrong with what they had just done and didn’t bother to at least understand why other cultures might take offence
They insisted they could do no wrong
what in fuck
pretty sure welsh speakers, breton speakers or gaellic speakers can read this but i sure fucking cant
If you learn German old english is easier, but aside from a few words it’s pretty much incomprehensible to me
Another way I would look at it , is that it would be very hard for a French speaker to understand Classical Latin, even though they’re both romance
I would imagine an Italian would have an easier time of it
It wasn’t too bad, just weird wording
What are the most horrible atrocities your country committed in their history
(Shut up Germany, we get it, bad man with moustache)
Australia had what's now called the stolen generation
The government used to kidnap aboriginal children from their families and take them to "missions" where they would be taught how to live and act as white people did in an attempt to assimilate them into European society
Moreover, Assimilation policy also sought to breed out aboriginal people through Biologically integrating them into White society- ethnic cleansing is the epitome of evil shit
Wow that's really interesting thank you so much for sharing
Not really, I know about Stalin's purges and another Russian person commented about "Russification" under Tsarist rule so if there's anything else other than that I would enjoy hearing it
Wow that's insane thank you for sharing
That's really interesting, thank you for sharing
Wow I hadn't heard of this until now that's really interesting thanks
In Australia the kids were taken if it was suspected that one of the parents were white
Was it the same in Canada
I understand entirely, thank you for sharing
Mustache man Austrian, mustache man rule Germany instead of Austria, Austria not blamed for mustache man
Thank you so much that's really interesting
Which country is this
In Australia, the children were forbidden to learn their own language, and each aboriginal "nation" (They dislike the term tribe) had their own language and many of them went extinct so there are no records of the language
I did service work in a town next to the border of Western Australia and the Northern Territory called Kununurra
It's a small town with a population of a few thousand with a high percentage of them being of aboriginal descent
There are less than 20 people in the town who speak the original language of their nation
Romania I'm guessing
Understood
A few other Germans commented that too, apparently your other bad moustache man, Wilhelm, attempted a genocide on the African population am I correct
Wow that's really interesting thank you so much for sharing
Yeah so I learnt from some of the other Germans that commented here
It's kind of interesting how we generally only look at the one section of history we are most familiar with and are surprised when we find out that other things happened during that time as well
It's 12:20 am and I pissed myself laughing
Oh my that's a very long list
Ah yes but mustache man make Germany do big bad bad and Austria did little bad bad so Germany blamed for big bad bad
A lot of them (Not all) ignore other countries history in favour of rewriting history books to make America look better
"We are the only reason the allies won world war one and two" and etc
Thank you both for sharing, this is her interesting and I do like to see both sides of an argument
Correct but what I'm trying to tell you is that although Austria is responsible for mustache man, the world leaders did not recognise it as such
But at the same time you created us
Theres
a lot in there
How did they get the girls from simply irresistable
I've heard it called "Sunday blues"
Did you need it to be a single word, or just a term for it
An Australian who doesn't eat Vegemite
An Australian allergic to prawns here
If I eat them, or anything cooked alongside them, I throw up all over the walls
An Australian tourist who doesn't harass the other hostel visitors
Some areas in the South West (definitely Dorset, not sure about others), cars are masculine
It completely threw me when I heard it

Edit: now I think of it, any complex machinery tends to be female in general - planes, trains, motorbikes
I wasn't aware of that when I visited Barcelona a few years ago
I had a great time, with only one weird experience
My cousin and I were walking near the beach just after midnight and this guy approaches and offers to sell us some weed
When we declined, he asked if we wanted some Cocaine or anything else
Took us a bit by surprise
Well a vacuum cleaner has a small hepa filter, Australians are having similar thoughts rn
Well thank goodness Fireman Sam was there to save the day
The Dutch invented Wifi, not Australia, contrary to what our government keeps telling us
Edit: I've had a bunch of comments all giving me different information on who invented Wifi
Can we just say it was a joint effort please
Yeah, no need to remind me
Our government is also good at subsidising mining companies that destroy our country
Ngl olive oil sucks for frying eggs
Vegetable oil or butter is actually better
Poland can into Czechia
I wish you and Poland luck in your endeavours
As an Australian I want to declare war on New Zealand and surrender immediately
Scott Morrison, our current prime minister, he basically did everything he could to ignore (or undermine) the bushfire crisis we had in January and February
This included but not limited to:
- Flying to Hawaii on a holiday for 2 weeks the second the crisis began, only came back after backlash from the entire planet
- Cut funding to fire services
- Selling our water to China in the middle of drought and fire season
- Undermining climate change policies (which he has been doing for years) despite the overwhelming evidence pointing towards CC being the main reason the bushfires were so bad this year
- Attempted to pass a stupid bill that NOBODY asked for, and would have backfired entirely if passed (Religious discrimination bill)
- Instead if using our taxpayer money to fund firefighting, granted it sporting centres for 0 fucking reason
Also, most of that money went to sport centres that the minister who proposed it participated at
The only person I could think of that would be hated as much as Scomo would be Martin Bryant who slaughtered 35 innocent people in cold blood in 1996
It was the last mass shooting in Australian history
Haig's also pretty hated by those who know of him in Australia, because there were plenty of Australians who died under his command
For some reason there's a park in my city called Haig Park that still hasn't been renamed
That doesn't really distinguish them
He's regarded quite well for his actions within Belgium
Yeah, I do think so
What gives you that impression
There are plenty who admire him
Yep pretty much
Britain for fish and chips
Oh, and Poland: We own Pavlova, not you
Yay for the Aussie mention
Much love big Zeus
We take great care of your big Greek expat family over here in Sydney & Melbourne
They did create you along with Prussia but I don't understand why you weren't called Flanders-Wallonia
Well if it involves trump, some idiots being Floridians or a natural disaster, a school shooting or people not doing the wrong thing, then yes, it is often
America is just a parody of what it used to be
(Not European obviously)
But if you visit sacred Aboriginal sites like Uluru and don't bother learning about it's significance and just pose for photos and say "haha big rock" you need to grow a fucking spine because shit like that is boring without learning about it's history and significance in the world's oldest living culture
Also, Canberra is overrated, correct, no tourists go to Canberra and nobody likes Canberra, everybody hates it, but it's still overrated because it's way more shit than people think
Parris that's all i hear when people come back home
Also- anything sound of music based in Salzburg
even my mum who loves the movie to bits says she preferred  the fortress to the SoM stuff
Oh well
Now I can watch the movie and say I’ve been there
Where would you recommend instead
Tbh I didn't learn about Aboriginal culture through websites or books, I got most of my knowledge first hand when travelling through the Northern Territory and Western Australia (especially in Arnemland) So I don't have any recommendations for you
But I will be able to answer some questions that you might have
I went to Apeldoorn once
How can anyone even have a strong opinion on that place
It's just a town with a cool palace
At least it's not offensively shit, like Rotterdam
I do in fact
- There are over 500 Aboriginal nations (They don't like being called tribes) each with their own unique language, stories and teachings
- There is no evidence to support Aboriginal nations conflicting with each other
They survived over 60000 years without war
- The Aboriginal people or "first nation" people have been around so long that there are cave paintings of animals that have long been extinct (When I visited Arnhem Land I saw one of an extinct species of giant bird that died out 30000 years ago)
- Each nation has their own stories but some are shared by other nations and they differ slightly, most of the stories you'll find online are either a combination of these differing stories or a version of it from a more well known nation
- Most Aboriginal "dream time" stories involve the rainbow serpent, a kind of Aboriginal deity which as the name suggests, is a rainbow snake
I might add more to this later, I'll put new edits here:
That's fair
In my half a year in NL I always found Dutch people to be super chill
Cafes are very often bars in the Netherlands
It is hard to believe but some evidence even suggests that Aboriginal people have been in Australia for more than 80000 years
60000 is the widely accepted length of time
That's really sad, it's by far the most interesting place I've ever been to
Bloody kiwi's
Hawaii
If I want to go to a pacific island, there’s plenty to choose from that haven’t been americanized and turned into a tourist factory
Oi, they're a good defence mechanism
>Many Millennials don’t drink alcohol anymore
Huh, another cultural difference I learned cuz of here In Aus, we have a massive binge drinking culture and epidemic in young people (16-26y.o)
I always thought Europe was the same
Australians will arrive anywhere in thongs (flip flops)
Sometimes you've just got to walk a little bit faster
Of course Australians arrive to Finland in flip flops
Are you going to dress for the 10 minutes it might take to get a taxi to the airport or for the 10 hours on a plane
*Les Misérables* is a story of some slightly sad and annoyed French people
Australia here and went to France for a few weeks
I am still surprised on how much stuff can happen in an area that is the size of my sub-district in my state
Like the Western front was as far away from Berlin to my house to Sydney
I always imagined it to be sooo far
And don’t get me started when people would fly to Paris and not endure that day drive
Youse guys don’t understand how good you have it
I'm an Australian who now lives in Europe
I just spent a month back home in country Victoria, and the one thing I got sick of was having to drive everywhere
And an hour would take me to the closest same sized town without traffic
And an hour in Europe is another country
Unless your work involves some kind of toxic or noisy process
If I worked at a metal smelter or an airport, I'd rather live a little further away for my quality of life
If you can make it within sunlight hours, it’s reasonable
But sometimes you have to make an overnight stop in a small country town with its only attraction is a ‘big thing’
Then it’s long
It takes me 1 hour 30 minutes to get to work
well in australia, I think we consumse most alcohol per capita in the world (off the top of my head)
Drinking a lot is just standard here
Yeah we have a bit of a drinking culture problem
"hey you *pause* yeah you *pause* get yer lawn mower *pause"* off my son" is one of the first things i heard when i visited belfast
I could never imagine a guy calling another guy 'love' without them being gay
No judgement, just seems a bit weird
Windshield phenomenon
Australia has so many issues with masculinity
The whole men must be men thing is out of control
I'm gay, and I still think it would be weird
Not weird in being bad, but in being 'odd'.
There's issues in Australia for sure, but I wouldn't say it's 'out of control'.
>A follow-up study by Kent Wildlife Trust in 2019 used the same methodology as the RSPB survey and resulted in 50% fewer impacts
The research also found that modern cars, with a more aerodynamic body shape, killed more insects than boxier vintage cars up to 70 years old
[13]
The study found that modern cars *killed more* insects
Scots definitely, I know barely anyone speaks it but it’s very similar to English
Beer, i don't drink myself but thats not going anywhere
Oh where do I start
I'll just say the one no one else has
Fairy Bread, it's bread with butter and hundreds of thousands over it
very nice
The world can thank Australia for the glorious invention of the [Chiko Roll]  You may not like it but this is what peak culinary delicacy looks like
A sausage wrapped up in a slice of white bread, with tomato sauce and onions
Having one at a polling place on election day is so iconic that we call it a ‘democracy sausage’. They can otherwise be found at Bunnings (hardware store) on the weekend or at any standard school fête/barbecue/outdoor event
Bunnings snags
McDonalds is the most popular here but we call it Macca's instead, but if your talking about exclusive restaurants then I would say Oporto, which I believe exists only in Australia and Singapore
It's my favourite fast food tbh
I usually hate ham and cheese sandwiches, but ham and cheese baguettes were like crack cocaine to me in France
The French make everything taste good
I'd say Italy probably has exported the most cultural dishes than anyone that are still considered as a cultural dish
Some of the others here I'm like "Oh, that's from *X*" but Italian food is Italian food
Australia: Whitlam giving sand to an Aboriginal elder
What about the broken wall that had a chunk knocked out
Or the united Germans on Brandenburg gate
In New Jersey we have created the widely recognized metric of how many fucks we chose to give in a certain moment
That's what I thought too
There's not much in Europe like Wieliczka
It was also iirc on the first ever round of UNESCO world heritage sites, so it's on the radar, too
I think Australia will soon follow
Haha my German friend showed me that in school
I never knew it was just a German meme ^_^
New Zealand, maybe America but they are more like cousins or the neighbours kid
Sorry Britain, the Jack's gotta go
I would definitely use the Eureka stockade flag instead ***IF*** it hadn't been hijacked by nationalists who use it as a symbol of Australian Fascism
The Eureka stockade was about workers rights and freedom from colonial oppression, not fascism
the folks at r/vexillology would have a fit over the complexity of the crown part lol
Flip it upside down so people get confused between Poland and Indonesia like they do with Chad and Romania
That sounds like they want him to fly the nest, tbh
“A 2010 Chinese thriller film Kill Octopus Paul depicts Paul's predictions as being part of an international match-fixing scheme
Excuse me but that actually sounds like a good film lmao
I really like German
It has that same "aggressive " tone as Arabic
I'm trying too learn it
The other germanic languages had those sounds at some point
It's definitely Germanic
Thanks Germany for all the funny comments on this subreddit
And thank you Scotland for all the funny tweets
Mainly Italy for inventing nutella
This is both amazing and so sad
Imagine being a Polish soldier, liberating the Netherlands and being so close to Poland, yet never being allowed to return under risk of being jailed or worse
I can’t stop imagining WW2 in this comment
I always lock as I live in a big city
It's pretty safe but I prefer to lock it
john went to the servo though the forest exept hes a pov cunt
It does for Australian, NZ and most English accents
Only doesn’t in US and some Irish and British accents
eg dijk would sound like saying ‘dayk’ not ‘dike’ in English usually
Your country isn’t a country until it has protesters
I don't disagree that it's bad for business, but surely that's still better than another wave
I learnt loads 10 mins on Al-Jazeera English that I didn't realise was going on globally
I wouldn't trust it to be objective on gulf/arab state affairs but looking out to the rest of the world it's brilliantly broad with concise stories
We heard it too
Horrible news
How is UCLouvain seen
I did my exchange last year, had the same two choices as you, and chose Erasmus
I can say you made the right choice; Rotterdam is a fucking grim city and the teaching at the uni was fairly inconsistent
I met some cool people, but it was pretty impossible to get to know non-exchange students well
I visited Copenhagen since and spoke to some CBS students and regretted my decision somewhat
(Heaps of Portuguese exchange students though if that helps lol)
Moldova is just a buffer state between the Romanians and Ukrainians
imo its like norway but cheaper
Very much, but certainly not as much as Romania, USA or Russia
The government is practically run by coal companies who funnel all their money into climate denial
Meanwhile, what the country is burning to the ground, our PM pisses off on a family holiday to Hawaii
Australia
Not as corrupt as say India, Indonesia and other developing countries
Not so corrupt that it's expected to pay the police like in some African countries
For a developed country I would honestly say very corrupt
Our current leader (prior to being elected) once brought "clean coal" into parliament
It's mainly mining companies, China (we are over dependent on China) and general big business
Corruption has rendered both major parties to be damn near identical
Here's a quick video narrated by Tim Minchin
A bit with some Chinese real-estate developers and mining companies, but it’s far better than in other countries
As stated in the post, Romania has a huge corruption problem does it not
Because Romania has big corruption issues like USA and Russia
It was just an example of countries with worse corruption than Australia
Australia isn't old enough to have classical music, but we do have Midnight Oil's "Wedding Cake Island"
Vienna rocks, it has ridiculously good public transport for the population that lives there
It's one of those cities I could definitely imagine living in
Perth is the second most isolated city in the world (The first is Hawaii), so it's natural that people say it doesn't exist
And Australia
Technically not another language but we have stupid slang words for some animals:
Joe Blake: Snake
Bin Chicken: Ibis
Massive cunt: magpies
Siemens are not well liked in Australia at the moment
We do
Yeah so if you see toilet paper, you're lucky
That's exactly what's happened here, no bog rolls to be found
People are actually getting violent over toilet paper
Meanwhile in Australia
people are buying 12 packs each
Jebiga - Serbian/Croatian meaning "fuck it", multiple ways to use it, like when you can't be fucked doing anything
I'm Aussie with a Serbian background and just taught that from Serbian friends
I'd translate that to a 'longing' in English
You're fucked in English and Germany
And the first computer
We made wifi
The Australian radio-astronomer Dr John O'Sullivan with his colleagues Terence Percival, Graham Daniels, Diet Ostry, and John Deane[8] developed a key patent used in Wi-Fi as a by-product of a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) research project, "a failed experiment to detect exploding mini black holes the size of an atomic particle".[9] Dr O'Sullivan and his colleagues are credited with inventing Wi-Fi
[10][11] In 1992 and 1996, CSIRO obtained patents[12] for a method later used in Wi-Fi to "unsmear" the signal

Particularly when they need to cut the car open to rescue people
Don't want to cut through a high voltage cable
Often have to cut through the frame at the bottom and hinge side of the doors
Depends on the extraction and access available
I don't think it is weird or negative really, very convenient for monolingual English speakers

Hey, we have [Solo] here in Australia as well
Although it appears to be different from the Norwegian version ;)

People in rural areas have strong feelings about cities, because this is where the politicians and businesses and news sources are located
This is where *stuff* happens
Conversely, people in cities don't usually ha e strong feelings about country people, because generally they don't even *think* about them
The UK tested their nuclear weapons out in the desert at 3 different locations
However, both the Australian and British governments failed to thoroughly check the areas that they thought were void of animal and human lives
Nyarri Morgan was an Aboriginal man who's family had been living in South Australia for 10s of thousands of years
His very first contact with Europeans was the detonation of an atomic bomb in Maralinga
"supposedly", it was mostly disproven but nobody knows what those quakes really were
As stupid as switching sides jokes, right
Cows milk
Gross
Hmm, not by itself, no
But with coffee, tea or similar things I enjoy it
What is the word for milk in Greek
Probably lactosia or something
Nevermind
I love the Greek alphabet
Would love to learn the language, but it seems a bit complicated
I also found this word
The Greeks are probably the best diaspora in Australia, even with their concrete gardens
Don't know really
When I did labouring work, the amount of grey haired Greeks I met was astounding
They could be in their fifties or sixties, but they put in as much work as people my age
The Italians are quite similar actually
Clever Austrians, making the world think that Mozart was Austrian, but Hitler was German
You guys also get called Sheep shaggers by the rest of Europe whilst Australia bullies New Zealand for the same reason, they also have way more sheep than you
In the UK and Europe, the Welsh are called the sheep shaggers
In Oceania, Kiwis are called the sheep shaggers
Assyrians, Kurds and Jews would also like to have a word
True, thankyou for correcting me
I know the Jews got their suburbs burned in Smyrna, I haven't read up on what happened in other towns
>so I guess we’re continuing with feet on both sides
No, I think the problem is that you have a foot on one side, and approximately thirty centimetres on the other
Oy cunt I’m comin for yah
Oiy Cunt I’m comin for ya
Take a selfie with a snake
Luckily it was a red bellied black snake which, although are extremely venomous, tend to piss off the second they sense anybody near them
Tourist was at least a few metres away from the snake which was sunbathing on concrete at the time, it's still dangerous to have your back to a snake though, especially if it's something like a brown snake which are agressive and venomous
My stomach plummeted just reading the comment, bloody awful
Indeed, the only country with a red, white and blue flag
As a semi rural Australian guy who plans to live in Milan, do you have any tips or links to help me not look like such an uncultured tourist
I've heard that's true
But I've also heard that you all dress more or less in a similar style, and there's not much individuality as there is in some other countries
I don't know how true any that is
That's very interesting and good to hear
I've always found the brand conscious way of dressing a bit gross, so I'm glad Milan isn't like that
I'll need to look into the song as well
Often
I lived for many years in the south of Denmark
I’d do my grocery shopping in Germany (half the price), and go to the dentist in Poland (quarter of the price)
Spend my weekends in Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands
Most of the time your national ID card is enough but always a good idea to have your passport just in case
Christ, I knew Europe was small and dense (in terms of distance between cities) compared to Australia but wow
I live in Sydney, New South Wales, it takes 3 hours to get to the capital, Canberra, and 8 to get to the next largest city, Melbourne
And that's only East coast cities
If you ever end up coming to Australia, trust me on this one, do NOT take a 14 hour bus ride from Sydney to Adelaide, it isn't worth it, and for Christ sake DON'T EVEN TRY GOING TO PERTH
The benefits of Schegen zone free movement really became apparent to me the first time when I spent 9 hours waiting at the Poland-Ukraine border, vs walking over the Poland-Lithuania border and seeing all the dismantled checkpoint infrastructure
It's the second most isolated city in the world (Hawaii is 1st)
It takes 28 hours to drive there from Adelaide, the closest city to it, and the only road between the 2 cities is only a 2 lane road
Not even a Highway
That's why I said "compared to Australia". But that bit about the Benelux is still amazing
And I thought inner Sydney was crowded
With the point of difference being that involves crossing the Nullabor, a place you really, really don't wanna break down
You won't be missing much except for wild Quokkas (Which are only found on a single island anyway, not in the city)
Never been to France but I just looked at the Arc Dr Triomphe on a map, isn't it essentially just a big roundabout
We have those everywhere in Australia, albeit much smaller
Even Canberra's roundabouts are smaller
Apparently, and I'm not 100% sure about this, but the Arabic name for Germany is Almaniã, I've been told this is a loan word from French although I'm not really sure
As an Arabic speaker this is news to me
Chinese Mandarin, it's taught in schools and we have the highest number of Chinese exchange students, therefore many immigrants from China
Would have thought Greek was probably the second language of Australia
The Greek diaspora here is still pretty connected to their homeland
Same with Nepal, Malta, India and many other countries
We're the most diverse country on earth so I've heard

You guys are so lucky to be born EU citizens
To OP, if you can go anywhere in the EU, I'd go to the Netherlands or the Nordic countries
The more I learn about these countries, the more I realise they've got their shit together
Smart, practical people
I'm in love with the Netherlands though
That would be my number one
Those guys are truly blessed
Most of them are extremely fluent in English anyway, so you'd be able to get by whilst learning Norwegian
Norwegian is related to English, lots of similarities
believe me, there are many other countries in Europe that don't even get to live a life that you italians have
plus all of the rights and freedoms you guys get as well
Hello, I'm a dual Australian-Italian citizen and I would like to join the smoking weed Airsoft party
Is there any particular part of Italy that is to be avoided for young people like myself looking to start anew

OUR EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSHIP
I'm not European so I don't think I qualify to answer this question, but I follow the politics in Finland, Moldova and Belarus
For Finland- I have a personal interest in both the country and it's politics and I'm also learning Finnish, so it's good practice
I became interested in Moldova and Moldovan politics because of its obscurity and political position
Needless to say, I now am drawn in by literally everything that happens there as its so interesting
I always kept an eye on Belarus for some unknown reason, but since August I have been following the protests very closely
Legal drinking age here is 18
People probably start drinking at 16 or 17 at piss-ups or other occasions
So I'd say very popular
I have done in the past but I really wish they'd implement a way to hide American units of measure, either with a separate language for English, or a setting in your user profile
No other language Wikipedia has this issue, but none are as large as the English one
Assuming I didn't die of childhood pneumonia (which was pretty bad tbh) I certainly would have bled to death in childbirth at 20
Dunno what else would be different
Maybe I'd still be a waitress
Guess I'd be a convict lol
Either that or taking land from the Abororiginals
The thing many people aren’t aware of is that Taiwan and China actually have economic cooperation with each other to the value of $150 billion a year
They deal with each other, no reason other countries shouldn’t deal with both
I shake my head when extremists in the US and elsewhere say we shouldn’t trade with China and that we should only support Taiwan
Politically, things are more complex
If everyone stopped playing megaphone politics, the world would be a better place
I guess the whole of Australia must be in the German countryside
If we want to be specific like that, we'd say '24 hours'. I can't think of one time in my life where I would have needed that
So that's probably why we don't have it
Self-evident
From your examples, the phrasal verb "work [something] out" is the closest that covers all these usages
>Skadefryd is another one
In English, they use the German word
They should have their own
And you guys have never borrowed words
Give me a break
We just say 'partner' for that
We have 'allrounder'
And never heard of that second word
And yet we still manage to survive
Nope, that's something I'm glad we don't have in English
There's other ways of showing politeness in English
We'd answer 'Yes, I am' or 'No, I'm not' to clarify
In many English dialects 'eh' or 'right' would be used for that
>You guys should not only adopt the word but the culture as well
Why
We just say 'just right'
Never heard that word spoken in English
Might be American
I've heard Norwegian spoken, and you guys say/use tons of English words without 'Norwegianizing' them (as do many other languages)
How is this any different
We have multiple words for 'funny'
I'm not offended, I just get a little annoyed with some of the comments on this post that claim English doesn't have X word, when quite often we do or we express it differently
As for borrowings, there's not one single language that hasn't borrowed vocabulary from other languages for concepts that don't exist in said language
You seemed to imply only English does this, maybe I misunderstood
English used to anglicise borrowings, but that's fallen out of favour, and nowdays we just borrow the word 'as is' as it's seen as more 'authentic'. I know some languages (maybe Norwegian
) change the word to suit to the language, but English tends to avoid that now
I think it makes English more of a dynamic language, but I can see why other languages don't like it
We do however change the pronunciation quite often, but not always
Maybe we should have had a word for that, but are you seriously telling me Norwegian has not borrowed any non-slang English (or any other language) words that didn't exist in Norwegian beforehand
I saw those 2 words you said in other posts
For pålegg we have spread/topping/filling
We don't have døgn, but we'd just say '24 hours' if we need to be that specific
I can't think of even one time in my life where that would have been needed
Anyway, rant over
Fair enough
Sorry for the rant
What’s wrong with the ol’ budgie smugglers mate
Wouldn’t that cause the same problem the other way, with Sjælland being the same distance away from Aarhus
Yes, it's why they come here
Any time of the day it's like a post-apocalyptic shitshow there
Irish pronunciation I can mostly wrap my head around, but the lenition for dh I'm still completely lost about, especially when it's at the end of a word
The only things I know about WW1 are that an Austrian died, the Gallipoli Campaign and Italy swapping sides
France is not my country - I don’t live in Europe - but i have trouble getting my head around what happened to Louis Braille’s body after he died
On the 100th anniversary of his death his remains were dug up from his grave in his village and moved to the Pantheon in Paris - except for his hands
His hands were left in his village
It seems everyone wanted a piece of Louis
I've read in the end the poms  figured it was better off having him in charge
Also there is documentary called 638 ways to kill Castro
Yeah people forget that stuff like beer were important commodities not that long ago
Hell Australia had the Rum rebellion in the 1800s where the military overthrew the colonial governor because he wasn’t paying the right amount of rum lol
It seems to be the UK (and by extension, all other English-spesking countries), Ireland and Italy that celebrate it on the 25th
Everyone else is on the 24th
It's the same here that the 24th is just a waiting day, nothing special
Same in Australia
It's a bit weird reading these comments
Had no idea Christmas Eve was the main celebration in most of Europe
Here, Christmas Eve is just an (mostly) ordinary day
All celebrations take place on the 25th
I would have thought it'd be January 7 for you guys, being orthodox and all
Wow, thats so different to here
Christmas Eve here is mostly just another day, and all celebrations are done on Christmas Day (25th)
Can't go out on Christmas Day because practically everything is closed
Fair enough
Learnt something new today
Not so much country, but you can usually tell people from certain regions and the ethnic groups that are native to them

Australia is a big country and I don't live in a tourist hot spot (although tourism is growing where I live) I'd say Sydney and Melbourne
Specifically the area around Sydney Opera house and I have no clue about Melbourne
Queensland, specifically Brisbane and the Gold Coast are popular destinations for domestic travel and I think it's a lot more popular now with international guests than it used to be
It has a bunch of theme parks there which I went to as a kid
Lofoten only started blowing up a couple years ago no
Travel books on Europe from what I've seen often exclude anything east of Czechia
You have to either look at individual country travel guides or get a whole separate 'Eastern Europe' edition
Now I'm not saying Lonely Planet is to blame for the imbalance in tourism but I think it does capture a snapshot of popular perceptions of Europe
Which is a shame because Europe has spectacular highlights the whole way east to west
Minnesota I know thanks to Prince, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash
It’s cold, middle north

Catalan is at least very similar to Spanish
English and Irish are completely different
Ok I see
I've met a few Northern Irish in my time and none of them could speak it (aside from some basic words)
Glad to see it's changing
The environmentalist political party in our country are deliberately lighting fires to trick people into thinking climate change is worse than it is
What’s “Bielefeld “?
Im from Australia, but my grandpa told me one small story when he was living in Serbia or Yugoslavia at the time, he watched one day as a German plane was being chased by a Russian plane
Both just flew over where he lived in serbia, They were fighting eachother, as one was firing the one in front did a loop to a avoid the other I can't remember the story completely I just remember the way he described it sounded pretty scary
>The similarity between Dutch and Afrikaans is a bit scary at times
Maybe because they're very similar languages
British cuisine is also built around the traditional dominance in trade so features spices from around the world, ones that don't even grow there
It's not like Mediterranean cuisine that heavily features herbs that can be foraged on a nice stroll around the village
The result is that when conflict disrupts trade, the food becomes boring
There's probably lots of country people foraging local herbs for fun but that's not the essence of the traditional dishes
Australian, reached Nuisberg because it doesn’t sound familiar
I've seen pictures of these so-called ugly German cities, and none of them I would call ugly
Many of them are very cute
Probably that Germans have higher standards, which is fair
Every single one of those countries would be considered "Eastern Europe" in English-speaking countries
So I guess it depends on how define it
Probably was Duisburg, near Essen and Dortmond
More like 'Woodj' with a hard J at the end
>Well Iasi, Romania is well known to Greeks
Well, clearly not so well known to *all* Greeks
Even though this isn't correct, in my mind there's Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia
I know Russia (West of Urals) is in Europe, but I still kinda think of it as it's own thing

For me, the German/Poland border is where the East/West European border is
Yes it is, but you gotta draw the line somewhere

I know many in Europe don't consider Poland to be 'eastern', but I do and always have
In the city of Brisbane, it's supposedly illegal to wear pink pants after 12pm
I say supposedly because many websites claim this but I couldn't find any actual evidence to support it
Seems very similar to the famous British TV licence, which I assumed was unique to that country
I don't understand why people think it's hard in English
Like sure you can't do it all the time but in spelling bees at school you would often get a word you have never heard before and have to sound it out
I was pretty good at spelling bees for this reason, my vocabulary wasn't that big but I could sound things out and with words that have silent letters, you can usually figure out where they go (like a double letter or a h)
Written text to pronunciation is even easier because even if a word can't be sounded out, you can usually tell if you are saying it wrong
Maybe this was just me growing up, idk
I will say names often tripped me up if I was reading a book and then watched the movie and the name is pronounced completely different to how I had read it for the whole series
Lol, no I actually suck now
My vocabulary is still as limited and I haven't done any spelling training since grade 6 and I for sure have gotten lazy since we have autocorrect now
And when we ask what it means in English, most of you struggle to say the word
During WWI, a group of Australian soldiers in France spotted an abandoned German tank in the middle of no man's land
Completely broken down and useless, they decided they wanted it anyway
They called bombers and artillery to distract German machine guns on the other side of NML, then rushed to tank and hauled it behind friendly lines with a chain and brute strength
The tank in question was the last of its kind, called the Mephisto, now resides in a war museum in Brisbane, Australia
I think about that a lot actually
Like a water technical
Australian Venturer here, (boy scouts 14-18 year olds, in the UK they call it Adventurers not sure about other countries) our uniforms are very different to those from most countries and we generally don't call it "Boy scouts", it's usually just "Scouts" because we include women in scouting as well (although Guides still only allow women)
We do most of what other countries do, knot tying, raft building, etc
But from what I've heard I think some of our systems and awards are a bit different
The different groups in Australian scouting go from Joey's, Cubs, Scouts, Venturers and Rovers
I know little about Joey's or rovers but I can outline some of the aspects of the rest
- Cubs: The teams of kids within Cubs are called packs, named after a different colour of wolf fur (Grey, brown, black red etc), the cub leaders use the names of characters from the jungle book rather than their real names
There is an award system called "boomerangs", if a cub gets the bronze, silver and gold boomerang badges they receive a grey wolf badge, the highest award in Cubs
- Scouts: teams are called patrols, some leaders can choose to use jungle book names but generally don't, most jungle book references are phased out by now
There is an award system with cords instead of badges, red cord, blue cord and green cord, patrol leaders where a white cord as well
The cords are worn around the left shoulder and are secure by a badge (campcraft badge if I remember correctly) on the uniform
All scouts are "expected" to have their red cord by the time they reach venturers, but I was a little cunt and never got it out of spite and laziness
- Venturers: No team system, these groups are much more independent than the other groups and generally organise their own activities (My group in particular is much more independent than most, we have organised our own overseas hiking trips in the past and were supposed to go to Austria this year and hike the Alderweg trail
) The awards are mostly optional, but the highest award is the Queen Scout Award (Which I think all commonwealth countries have) and this award looks better on resumes than the Duke of Edinburgh award, that's one reason why I'm trying to get mine, the other is that I spite the DOE award because I did the bronze DOE hike and it was shit
Edit: Teachings and Activites in Joey's - scouts generally have a bit more emphasis on Aboriginal Australian culture, because if you think about it then everything Scouts have been doing, the Aboriginal people have been doing for over 50,000 years
i think there was a small roman site they found a couple years back when some people found roman coins in ireland
>Roman baths found under the museum (which was very handy, and immediately incorporated as a big open display
You've got to hand it to the Romans, they were good at planning ahead

How common is it to use the English word ok/okay in your language
In the English-speaking world, we use this word A LOT
Just wondering if it's crept into other European languages or not
It can be used as an affirmation to a question and/or to confirm understanding, or adjective to mean something is passable/acceptable ie "His test went ok" (wasn't great, but wasn't terrible either)
We also use it at the beginning of sentences, like "Okay, so this
How do you use it if so
We rarely write 'okay' either, but I think that's the 'proper' way to write it
Is that just when speaking Irish, or do you say that stuff when speaking English as well
Okidoki (okeydoke/y) is seen as a different word, and is a bit old fashioned
We just use 'Ok' 95% of the time
But there's also OK, O.K. Okay is the only other one, but that's rare
A bit extreme
That looks very French
I didn't even know that accent existed in Dutch
TIL
I was taught fin de semaine at school
'Okay' makes it seem like an actual word, and less like an abbreviation (which it actually is)
I think they tried to get us to learn 'pure French' and avoid English words, even if they're common there
Might have changed now
That was almost 20 years ago
'Orl Korrect', which is a play on All Correct
It was invented and popularised by you guys
I only found this out today
Didn't know that one either
I've been saying normalcy my whole life
It sounds like a proper word to me
Just like privacy
I guess now it *is* a proper word
Now I'm confused whether I use normalcy or normality more
I'll just go with both

When most people think of Poland's history, they usually think "Haha, got fucked in the 2nd world war", but its history before that is fascinating
I was very surprised when I learnt that they had a dual-monarchy with Lithuania and owned a huge area of Eastern Europe
I'm a native English speaker, with German as a second language
When I hear the Dutch speaking, my first thought is that I've had a stroke
Sorry Dennis
Yeah, I think once I've mastered German (ha ha ha, never gunna happen) I might try my hand at learning Dutch
There was a Dutch woman (who of course spoke perfect english, and i believe french as well) in my beginners class for German language
Her learning process was - "okay, so I change this and this and this
Right, got it
A friend of mine returned to Germany after living in Scotland and then Australia for ore than a decade
More than one German asked if she was Dutch because of her accent,  or complimented her on having good (But not great) German
In one job interview, she was asked if she would like to speak in English, because she struggled with "professional" German vocabulary
German is even hard for the Germans if they don't practice enough
I speak a bit of Greek and it’s rare I’ll have a full conversation in it, but if anything it’s the reverse - a certain shift in my mood or personality will bring out some Greek phrases, especially when I’m being sarcastic or telling off a friend
Vatican City and San Marino are Groovin’
Technically speaking a double dissolution in Australia is kinda when government collapse, but both houses getting dissolved is kinda meant to happen if government gets complete fucked
I think 1975 during the constitutional crisis when Gough got the boot was probably the first and only time a federal Australian government collapsed
PMs get sacked all the time but government still chugs along fine
Obviously caveat to this comment is I’m not European lmao
Anytime a politician touts policies as stuff that will promote ‘family values’ is a time where you should start running for the hills

My motherland (UK):
*  In terms of the concept alone, the Geffrye Museum of the Home, showcasing interiors from various periods in history
It's currently closed for renos and thanks to covid, won't open until 2021
*  In terms of execution and general swishness, TfL London Transport Museum
A very well presented modern style of museum that I found engaging and relatable
*  In terms of the best thematic soft play area, the Kelham Island Museum
Look, the museum is awesome all round but an ironworks themed soft play was amazing for the kids I don't have and I definitely didn't play in it myself instead
My adopted home (AU): Immigration Museum in Melbourne
Thematically relevant to me so probably biased, but a great and accessibly presented modern museum including an interactive on screen exhibit where you can play the part of an immigration officer in a few historical periods, examining prejudices and motivations at the time
If anyone's still reading, also go see the Museum of London, Chatham Historic Dockyard and the Combined Military Services Museum in Heybridge, Essex, although the last one is an older style item and card note of museum, it's beyond exhaustive as a collection of weapons from history
Oh and Kirkgate in the York Castle Museum
I like museums
I still have nightmares about the Uffizi
My parents are huge history buffs so the year we spent living in Italy was spent travelling around looking at stuff
Which was now that think back on it, really fucken cool
At the time though I was really young so I didn’t really appreciate art and well history all that much
Spent like 8 hours in the Uffizi gallery sick lmao,  I’ve held a grudge against Di Medici ever since lol
I really enjoyed that museum
The museum at Schlinder's factory was also quite good, and an underrated one would be the Silesian museum in Katowice
There are a lot of Eucalyptus trees in Portugal
Garlic is awesome though
Yes, although I’m honestly surprised that it hasn’t been legalised here already considering how much money the government could make by taxing it
Australia has one of the greediest governments in the world
Not European obviously but when I was younger I used to think that all of Europe was part of Britain and everybody there spoke English
Yet again I also couldn't tell the difference between Australia and Africa on a map and I thought Alaska was part of Canada
So you thought Prussia was Pre-Russia
Edinburgh, Seville, Salzburg, Prague, Krakow
Not perfectly East-West, but variety in location there
I think my list is biased to scenic cities though when there's plenty of others I think are top quality
I wonder if you've *really* looked at middle English
I find it very hard to understand without prior study
Thats so weird/interesting that your language is so stagnant like that
But I think it's cool
I do wonder how much longer that will last though due to modern media and communications
I think it's easier for English-speaking (L2) Germans to understand than it would be for a monolingual English-speaker
However if an English-speaker has learnt even just basic German or Dutch, it will become much clearer to them
When these texts, if I read them it's quite difficult to understand
However, when you hear them spoken with the old phonetics - it's much easier to follow and understand
It's not something most normal people would even care about to be honest
I, on the other hand, think this sorta stuff is fascinating
You may find that Finnish is quite different in 50 or 100 years
And I'm not just talking about loanwords, but just the way sentences are structured (or grammar more broadly) and things like that
Yup, that's how i'd know it
I can't speak German, but I would know hundreds of common German words just from picking them up over the years
I've watched 4 or 5 lesson videos on YouTube, so that's all I know of German
But even that still helps me with understanding old texts
Germans are often asking questions like this, or
They ask "Can you explain me what I said wrong
Oh dear,  I dropped articles all the time when I was barely conversational in Italian
Lol I must have spoken incredibly broken Italian, mi dispiace
It's fine
But it's *The* police exists
Wouldn’t be weird,  makes sense to me
It's almost like different languages have different meanings for words
Only in British English
We use both is and are here
Yup, and plenty of other languages change meanings of their loanwords too
It is what it is
We're not going to change the word because of it
It's too well ingrained into the language with the current meaning
There are soooo many English loanwords in other languages which mean nothing like the original English word
We don't bitch about those

I love it
I was always taught it's better form to use the same regional spelling and grammar self-contained within a piece of writing
It's hard to keep track of that if like Word just had a universal English where it recognises everything
Australia has a lot of great bands:
- Midnight Oil: My favourite band if all time, they make rock music and all of their songs are written about environmental, economic and social issues in Australia
(Beds are burning is about the stolen generation, Dreamworld is about the construction of the Dreamworld theme park, etc)
- The Chats: A very Australian band, all of their songs are based on Aussie humour and contain A LOT of Australian slang that I don't think many Europeans will understand
I recommend Smoko if you want to hear some of that
If you have trouble understanding any of it feel free to reply to this comment and I'll gladly translate it for you
- Cold Chisel: An all around good band from the 70s/80s, wrote one of my favourite songs which is Khe Sahn
- AC/DC: Need I explain acka-dacka
I have almost certainly missed some, I might edit this later to include more
Waltzing Matilda is a much better tune our current anthem
A Polish mate of mine told us about the same thing
I remember he showed us some examples or something (memory’s a bit foggy, it was a whole back) and we had a good laugh
Heavily influenced by the 'White Australia Policy'

Not personally but I hear the Japanese get real angry when people mention all the horrible stuff they did during the Meiji-era
I figured I'd have a better chance with the Dutch page than anything but it looks like an elaborate joke
I understood the first 5 words then it degenerated into alphabet soup
Not very much from the Nordic languages, only a few words that sound similar to English, but I understand a fair amount of German and a little bit of Flemish because I am currently learning German for my trip to Austria this year
As an Aussie that's studied German I obviously get German and English
Dutch was about 50%, enough to get the gist, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish I got a couple words, recognised a bunch of words I can see being derivative of central Germanic
I know I'm not European but all my heritage comes form there so I thought I'd give some input :)
Intresting
There is some like Roki Vulovic who talk about the war and the soldiers, then there is those who talk about wanting to blow up mosques and stuff like that (Koridor, Miro Semberac, and others) and then there’s ones that sing a mix of the two like Baja Mali Knindza
The only one of those that's half good is Auld Orange Flute, the rest are pretty underwhelming
And the unionist version of "The Men Behind the Wire"  is dreadfully boring- should've named that one something else so it wouldn't get conpared to the Republican one
That's fair, they sure love their marches up there
I was walking around Stormont the other weekend and there was some military marching band playing their way up to parliament
We have the monstrosity known as Mamungkukumpurangkuntjunya Hill

He took the thing by boat from Darwin to Singapore and then the rest of the journey was overland

Makes sense considering it to be a sectional view of cylindrical food

In Indian English, I have heard it frequently called "at the rate of", even when it's not being used in a unit rate context
I believe it's a slip of the tongue by the users as Indian English doesn't mandate that as its name
Hopefully an Indian person can chip in here

Possibly worth noting that the standard voltage in the US is 110/120 volts, as opposed to 220 everywhere else
As a result most Americans don't have electric kettles, because they'd take forever to boil, whereas coffee makers are much more common

Lovely spam, wonderful spam
Can't forget [Zoutelande] by Bløf also
Lovely lyrics, and as a bonus it's neat to hear the contrast between the accents of the Dutch lead singer and the Belgian featured artist Geike Arnaert
I'm trying to learn Caoine Cill Chais atm, but the difficult thing about learning Irish music is that just because you're listening to a recording of Irish people, doesn't necessarily mean they aren't also butchering the pronunciation
I much prefer Zoutelande actually
The lower key and richer voices help, plus the Dutch language just suits the song better I reckon
Fair enough
I heard the Dutch one first so it sounds far more natural to me, just perspective I suppose
Same for australia
Except we're not confused
The English numbers make perfect sense, to us
It's what we've learnt and grown up with, so we're just used to it
Most English-speakers have never heard of a 'milliard'.
What's the second meaning
If you're referring to the way it was in Britain and commonwealth countries like 70 years ago, no one knows or uses that system anymore
Billion always means 1000 million
It's pretty universal and ingrained in the language now
Ok, that's very different to here then
I also was a child in the 90s and billion was always a 'thousand million', and trillion is a 'thousand billion'. Never knew there was any other way until recently
I meant universal in the English language, and English-speaking countries
I thought that was obvious by context
No, there's the standard meaning of universal (as in everything in the universe, or everyone in the world)
But you can also use it to mean 'everything/everyone' in a specific context
For example 'Eating cheese is universal in France', which would mean that practically everyone does it in France across all ages, regions, cultures etc
It starts with one poolside chair
Let them have their own land
They're not native to here
I think its the lack of a regional accent
Most British people would have a regional accent growing up
Often people might speak great English , vocab and pronunciation wise, but they often keep the rhythm  or stress timing (for lack of a better word) of their native language
>Before that, I'd just use less with everything
Trust me, most native speakers do the same thing
Maybe not pretentious, but it sounds to me like something only older people do or care about
Unless you're an English language teacher, most people don't care (especially young people)
It's like 'whom', slowly going out of usage
Pretty sure every Anglophone person here calls it "kicking the bucket"

It seemed to be similar in Argentina
In Australia we have a brand of meat pie called "Four'n Twenty".
It comes from the old poem "Four and twenty blackbirds, baked in a pie"

Sounds delightful, is it friendly to visitors
Oh, the Buddhist region where the alien chess guy is from

Not a weird government agency but the way it came about was weird
In the 1940s, somebody through an egg at the prime minister's head during a rally, he got so furious he got the police to investigate it and find whoever was responsible
They turned out empty handed so the PM said "Fuck it, the regular police are fucking useless
" (Not his actual words) So he founded the Australian Federal Police (Aussie FBI) and got these guys to find the guy who threw an egg at him
Unsurprisingly, they too were unsuccessful in capturing the first egg boy
Advance Australia Fair is quite contradictory:
"Beneath our radiant Souther cross, we've boundless plains to share
By boundless plains, it means detention camps on shitty little islands in the Pacific

Much better than the voting 'liberty and wealth and prosperity' type of anthems
In Australia we often refer to biscuits as "bickies" and chocolate as "choccy"
Probably, we've been calling it choccy milk for decades
"Good Day"
Ay pulled yeah
We have yellow page phone books in Australia
But I think that's because the company itself is called "Yellow Pages". Or maybe they called themselves that because they decided to use yellow pages
hmm
In Australia it'd be either stockmen or bushrangers, but most prominently bushrangers
Bushrangers as the outlaws of colonial Australia were deep in the Australian psyche by the early 20th century, with bushranging films being very popular, until the government cracked down on them
Australia's most famous bushranger himself, Ned Kelly, also was aware of the cultural impact of it in colonial Australia, when while on the run in the late 1870s, and having briefly comandeered a pub, allegedly made one local lad play the famous folk song "Wild Colonial Boy" for him
Wild Colonial Boy is a traditional song shared in both the Australian and Irish folk traditions (although the versions differ slightly) and which is supposed to be originally based on Jack Donahue, a bushranger of the 1820s.
> Colonial Australia is intriguing to me
When I was a child I found Australian history quite boring, because it really is taught in a fairly dull way, but there are a lot of quite interesting moments in Australian history
On colonial Australia too, some of the tidbits of history that occurred are wild, and not even well known in their own country

Peking is very old fashioned

The story I was told is that Peking is just the forbidden city where the emperor lived and Beijing is the rest of the city around it,  and since China no longer has an emperor all of Beijing became the capital

We were taught cursive in primary school but next to nobody actually properly learnt it or uses it
Also the school I went to had a rule where you weren't allowed to use a pen until you could write in cursive and received a "pen license" but some people including myself used a pen anyway and if any of the other students questioned us, we would tell them (politely) to fuck off
Most people including myself and I'm sure many of you guys, HATE writing in pencil, so many of the teachers in just let it slide, as they to, knew that pen licenses and cursive writing is fucking bullshit
Vaguely related: In year 6 my school tried to teach us to "touch type" and use both hands on the keyboard when using a computer
They ran 2 lessons of this and then realised that teaching primary school kids the opposite of what they have been doing their whole lives was a shit idea and dropped the program entirely
I was totally paranoid about pickpockets and shit in Florence and Rome
They're just some of the biggest tourist destinations, and that naturally attracts these people
I had a zip on my bag opened on the Rome metro where it was busy, but nothing of value was in there and I kept everything important close at hand

They need some koalas
And be careful that some drop-bears don't sneak in amongst them
Well eucalyptus oil is toxic to animals that haven't evolved to tolerate it, so unless they imported some koalas along with the trees it's not that strange that there wouldn't be much in the way of wildlife in them
Is it like the trans-tasman rivalry between Australia and New Zealand, where if you're in Australia then Kiwis are sheep fuckers (because they have the most sheep per capita in the world), and if you're in New Zealand then Aussies are sheep fuckers (because we have the most sheep in the world)
It's a brand name for a lab grown cheese with no animal content
Except they don't. They conveniently shift the cost of healthcare and retirement to deductions from their salary rather than included in income tax
If you add it back they are almost on par with Scandinavia with less than half the social safety net and working 50% more hours
For best results in a limited weekend, buy some fresh shellfish from the market and eat them raw

Holy shit,  I didn’t know what Qormeh was but looked it up
It looks fucken amazing
There was a spate of Thai restaurants in Sydney for a while (“Thai tanic “) is the only I can remember now though
I was briefly horrified to see “Curry Munchers” in Queensland around 15 years ago
A lot of species here are nocturnal so a lot of these are at night
I live in Tasmania and so while there are kangaroos in the state, they aren't actually in the area I live in
On mainland Australia in rural areas kangaroos are a common sight
My house backs onto a lake so we have ducks, plubbers (plovers/Masked lapwing) regularly nest in my yard
Usually in the bottom half where it's closer to the lake and turns into a swamp during heavy rain
So Many Rabbits (I've seen black ones I thought were pets) and Hares
They are a really bad invasive species here
Lots and lots of wallabies as soon as it turns dusk
They're cute
Wish my dog wouldn't kill them
Snakes, specifally Tiger Snakes but I actually haven't seen them but I know they're there because they killed 2 of my dogs
We don't get brown snakes here
Mainly copperheads and tigers
Ring-tailed possums
I've seen them sleeping in trees regularly
Very cute
At night we get barred bandicoots that leave small holes in the yard, wallabies, owls and probably more but I don't see them
I've never seen nor heard a Tasmanian Devil in my yard
This area would be a bit dangerous for them anyway because of the cars
Italy
some people want to get rid of french loan words and replace them with german ones, i think it’s called Anglish
Omg "éblabla" might be the funniest/strangest word I've ever seen lol
As an English-speaker, I'd be interested to see how this sounds
Do you know of any examples on YouTube
Have you got a similar trick to remember selvfølgelig
It gets me every time
Hahah I guess I will have to stick with that
I hadn’t ever broken it up completely though, so thanks for that
I always just type what I think until autocorrect takes over, it’s the f/g/v combo that gets me I think
I got confused the very first time I had to write it and then always second guess myself since then
The closest person we have to that would be Ned Kelly, despite being a murderer, thief and overall and extremely dangerous criminal bushranger (Australian Cowboy)
You can find references to him all over the country, almost always involving his iconic helmet and armour
David is like the British version of Steve Irwin, he's an absolute legend
He does very well when paired with a comedian that makes him seem funny
Not to mention in France the hundreds of war material dug up by farmers after being left there in WW1, and the Zone Rouge where humans aren’t allowed
And also the fact that Turkey's current leader insulted us (Australia) because of our failed Gallipoli invasion
You guys are going to hate me, but mixing ketchup and mayonnaise is next level yum
My dad's family are Cockney tho so nothing beats vinegar with salt and lots of pepper
Mustard is yummy, I'm willing to give it a try
In Australia it's the least fancy way we know to make a thousand island dressing
And we're not into fancy so eh
i was driving around in amsterdam and i thought my car was broken because it said -5 above sea level lmao
People of Britain and France how does the older generation see the former British and French empires compared to how the younger generation sees it
(This question could also apply to Germany and Russia)
Yeah, sure
I can see why because it’s a time where they had it good and they were on the top, my pop who has lived in Australia his whole life looks back on those times with a bit of nostalgia too
Maybe except the nobles, but they were most English so I don’t think they count
Yeah, I don’t get why the British treated some of their people so badly
For example the 13 colonies, if they did put unreasonable tax’s on them, they could’ve retained those lands for much longer
Same with India when in the 40s they just let million stave, that one I kinda get just a bit because they were at war but they were the most powerful nation on Earth at the time
The British I would say treated Australia alright, maybe except in Ww1 sending us to our deaths in Turkey because it’s lot like it was British boys dying
The huge parts of the island being off limits kinda sucks since Malta is already suck a small island
But when I went to Valletta it felt like London just in the mediterranean
That's actually very interesting, I always forgot how long the Ottoman Empire lasted, I would say the British Empire lasted about 140 years but the Ottoman lasted 600
Tbh I think it brought a lot of good things to the world yet a lot of bad things
My dads friend was born in Germany and she says she never really learned about ww2, she just knew they lost and committed war crimes
This is needless pedantry, I'll admit, but I think a better term for the UK is post-christian
I.e. it isn't really any more, but cultural bases and assumptions can very frequently be traced to its christian history

Isn't that Spanish
I only know it from that song
I've just never bothered to look up what the lyrics mean, it was just really catchy when I was 12
and I just looked it up, and now I realise how long ago my childhood was
I thought it was Spanish, I've now learned it's not
Oh thank you very much
I knew I shouldn't trust Google translate
I see, no wonder I can't find out what it actually means
as an australian
i feel i can answer this and that answer is 2017
i dont know how that topped then, there was nothing special to it- not like our other top tens-
That song was legit awful
The voice crack didn't help
dutch language sweetie i am so sorry
aava .... rest  in peace
Only on anzac day,  which if i remember correctly, is the day when Australians and kiwis landed in galipoli
Yeah, the red poppy is used for remembrance here too, and for ANZAC day
Do you feel like other comments that it's a British tradition
I don't myself
I though this said Australians and was wondering why it was here and was boutta comment on it
From what I understand reading history, Germany is more an idea than a country
The idea of a nation encompassing all german-speaking peoples in Europe, uniting them under one banner
If Austria didn't have their own empire, they could've been included in the German nation themselves
Ah, I see
So if the socialist elements of the March revolution got what they wanted, Austria would've been part of a "greater Germany"
Slovenia is very mountainous, no
That's probably why there are so many different dialects
Usually happens in mountainous countries
>(exceptions I know about are Russia, Poland, USA),
I can't speak for Russia or Poland, but USA definitely has large variation in accents, especially considering it's a lot younger country
I also find it so odd that such a huge, and old, country doesn't have accents/dialects
That's true
And I guess you guys used to be in a union with Czechia as well, so that may have had an impact
I would say that generally everyone in the major cities sound the same, though there are a few words unique to each state
When you get to more rural areas, however, it’s a bit of a different story
Yeah, the Republic of Czechoslovenia ;P
Lol
I'm fully aware of the differences
Just teasing the Slovenian guy ;p
A massive city sitting on an island in the middle of the ocean
It’s a marathon wide
I actually know a lot about Singapore but this always sticks in my head and no one has mentioned it
I like your open-minded, live and let live perspective
And of course it applies to travel anywhere but especially when the cuisine is more culturally different to what we are accustomed to
That said, I have grown accustomed to Singaporean food too and wouldn’t eat a western meal there now
And a Scottish king formed a union between England and Scotland, but Scotland was the junior partner
Kind of like Poland-Lithuania when after the 1444 incident Lithuania's Grand Duke became the king and Grand duke of Poland and Lithuania
Lithuania, although bigger, was the junior partner of the union with Poland being the senior partner
It's not annual
International Rules is a weird beast as a sport for a bunch of reasons
On the surface you can say it's reasonably competitive though
For one it pits amateurs against professionals
On another it favours more heavily Irish tactics and positions and game flow, but is tempered with Australian physicality
Then there's a trend in both countries where the purists who are ignorant of the other code complain because they think it's "Too Gaelic rules" or "too Aussie Rules" so they snub it
And then there's rising and falling interest in it, so not always the best teams are sent
In 2013 Australia said "fuck it" and sent an All-indigenous team just to shake things up
In 2017 there were some quite good tests with great players fielded, but even despite the quality *still* Ireland fielded no players from All-Ireland champs Dublin, nor did Australia have any from AFL premiers Richmond
So like
I love the Irish :)
The Holy See
Tiny by landmass, but fucking huge by influence
Wars over the the known world have been wages in the past from that seat of political power, even today, the Catholic Church holds immense power from that physical seat of residence
Plus we hold the lion's share of the world's uranium and a good chunk of the coal
Plus the influence
And the quality is incredible, they say the Germans make good stuff, but I've been on Irish made medical equipment myself when I was having Chemotherapy, I cannot remember for the life if me the company, but I'm fucking glad of the quality and the job it did
I was impressed and surprised that it was Irish when I was trying to find a model number to silence the bloody beeping
I wanted sleep, and it wouldn't shut up
True, and really, despite politically in some of these regions, and the pain in the arse of getting stuff in and out of them, they are rich in resources, meaning that in the future, economically, they could be pretty decent hitters
And if you believe the theories, politically in the background, the world
You guys are in the same boat as us in Australia, heaps of land, but nothing really out there
Well we are the only country that for the overwhelming majority of its history took up an entire continent, and with a rounded percentage, still do
Newer trains yes
They’re called quiet carriages
We do but nobody ever obeys it
I feel like there is enough demand for a replacement for Reddit aimed at a global context
Something akin to having globally or specifically scoped subreddits, not to exclude, but to contextualise discussions
With a bit better multilingual support and maybe poster flags
globalchat
com/at/politics (if en-EN locale) and globalchat
com/at/Politik (if de-AT locale) would resolve to the same thing, etc
>I've learned that English speaking people never ever respond with just one word
Responding with just yes or no is very rude, you have to say something like "yes, I am", "no, it's not".
Depends on the context
But it can sound very abrupt and defensive if you just say 'No'. Saying 'No I don't' sounds a little nicer
>but our teacher didn't tell us they're used just in the uk (and australia
We say eggplant and zucchini
Those are British names
For a long time, I thought an aubergine was a different thing to an eggplant lol
Only later in life did I learn they were the same thing
Literally all of those are still common and used in Australia lol
It's more like "chai pas". J'ai pas means "I haven't"
In Australia we're the same as the Americans, and say eggplant and zucchini
Do you guys say the 'aubergine emoji' when talking about that
Yup, it was a common thing 100 years ago
Youd sound stupid saying it today, but people will still understand what you mean
It sounds quite pretentious nowdays
>If you say "tomorrow we shall drive to the store
Wouldn't sound out of place here, although it's quite often pronounced 'shell'
I use 'whom' whenever I'm trying to sound pretentious and smart
>yeah I have no idea why "pronto" became a way to say "quick" in English
It does NOT mean that in Italian
Because that's what it means in Spanish, so people probably get them confused
Now I know that it means in Italian, but if I didn't, I would think answering with pronto is rude, like saying "hurry up
I've heard multiple times that Americans nob longer use shall
It's still pretty common here
Yup
There are other ways of saying it too, but still pretty common to say shall
We hear it in old timey movies, like Mary Poppins or Gone with the wind
And that's what you'll sound like if you say it haha
I believe it's fallen out of use in the US, but we still use it
It's probably slowly dying here though
I like names like
Townsville
Cockburn
Broken hill
Mount dissapointment
Thats all i could think of of off the top of my head but there is plenty more
Oporto
Like the restaurant
Munster is also Münster but I think the double dotted Münster is German and the other is Irish
Heraklion
Is that the capital city of Crete, the rectangular island
And Pella (The capital city of Macedonia during Roman times)
Like Sparta
Literally anywhere that isn't Perth, Darwin or the East Coast
I met a Swede playing rugby in holland, seemed pretty unusual
He'd started playing somewhere abroad, can't remember where but it wasn't in Sweden
Not global
In Australia, eggs are refrigerated, unless you bought them from a farmer's market or something
Yep, the eggs are normally in the fridge section
I've been to markets where they're out because the stalls don't have power or what have you, but refrigeration is most common
And most Aussies keep our eggs in the fridge regardless
How fresh is Aussie food compared to European
Born in the land down under
Thanks for the explanation
Was interesting to find out how it was different
Which country has the worst and best food you've had so far
Thanks for the response mate
Some say the Greeks or Russians say they are the heirs of the Romans, but based on history, it  probably was the North Italians or Greeks
Greece has been in the empire longer than the Roman Empire existed (Remember Byzantium existed for longer than the Romans became a nation)
Then the crown and legacy was given to the Spanish, but I'm not sure why the Russians claim the crown of the purple
san marino, does that count
they actually have a legitimate claim to the roman empire since they're the only sovereign state who interacted with the romans a lot and still stands
Everything I know of this is from reading Asterix
>The US is unique in that regard
Australia - "Hold my beer, we're taking the ute to the Drive-Thru Bottle-O"
This is why the English dialect is the best dialect of the English language
It brings a tear to my eye
Edit: sorry Scots
The fuck am I sposed to know
I ain't Scottish nor a pom, I just said English cos of the flair
Probs like Glaswegian or some shit
Yeah nah Aussie accent is not as homogeneous as people think
You got Adelaide then the 3 main types
But since I insulted the Scots by calling them English
They get to use 1 Kiwi pass on me
Can't say what they gave done to remain in power but I can tell you about a ton of bullshit our current PM has done but for some reason still remains in power
Humidity tends to be lower during the day when there are larger temperature differences between day and night
Although coastal regions tend to stay pretty steady, in my personal experience - probably depends on the wind direction and how much the air passes over open water
You tend to notice the humidity more when its hot, as you sweat more to cool off, but your sweat doesn't evaporate as fast
It kills me too
It depends the restaurant, at McDonalds or some bar it’s not weird but if it’s at some high end restaurant then it would be out of the ordinary
So we aren't going with "Swamp German" for the Dutch
I'd like to, but as with most Finnish words, I'm too scared to try and pronounce it
Are all the letters silent
ayy boaty mcboatyface fan here aswell
*Germania* - nice name
Why don't you rename your capital city to that
yes please
Reminds me of my Chilean classmate in our German language course
Teacher - "Sport"
Classmate - "eeShporte"
Teacher- "Nein, nur *Sport*"
Classmate- "*eSssshporta*, es ist gleich, oder
England - English
Poland - Polish
Iceland - Icelish
Greenland - Greenlish
Netherland - Netherlish
New Zealand - New Zealish
And so on
English is a very logical and strict rule-based language
And by those rules it should be Englandic
Why are all the county names of Ireland pretty close between Irish and English, but then Dublin is Bhaile Átha Cliath
Ich bin kein Deutscher
That's ok
I like to ask Germans to say "clotheshorse"
I think what you are trying to say, is that English is "the language of the Engls (Angles)" and that England is "the land of the Engls (Angles)".
The Netherlands is not "the land of the Nethers" (although I would like it if we referred to it as "the Nether regions") therefore there is no "Netherish".
That's a pretty cool bit of history, thanks
I love the name Philippine but as someone living near the Philippines (and not in France) it wouldn’t work
I like Filly for a nickname but there isn’t many good ones lol
Don’t worry mate, I want to visit Austria
Vienna especially looks beautiful to me
Also as an Australian I feel a sense of camaraderie with you guys considering our countries get mistaken for each other all the time lol
Wait really
I have plans to go to Italy with my girlfriend in the future, she often has her hair dyed a soft blue or pink hair
Is there usually any trouble as a result of this or is it just staring
Is it all of Italy or mostly rural places
People complain about the smell in Venezia
Just smelled like a dam or river city too me
It was one of my highlights from when I lived in Italy,  an absolutely beautiful city; also quite amusing to visit considering I lived in Genova at the time Venezia’s rival city
Does Scottish surnames do both Mc and Mac
If so, what are the differences
As an Australian, I for one expect that if I'm not in a country whose official language is English, then I expect to be able to talk to very few people
So I'm not gonna be surprised if I'm in Italy and people speak predominantly Italian
Could of instead of Could’ve
Could care less instead of Could not care less
A bunch of Americanisms also gives me the shits sometimes too
Having said that I don’t mind Americans themselves, just get the shits when it’s my fellow Aussies not knowing their own culture
Obligatory not European and technically not our neighbour but we have had way too many close encounters with China
They have harrassed our planes and ships in the South China Sea, and just last year during the Tiananmen square massacre anniversary, they sailed 3 fucking warships into Sydney Harbour, I can only assume because our prime minister was in the Solomon islands at a meeting about China's influence in the South China Sea and they wanted to intimidate us
More recently however, due to the pandemic, our government has been pissed at China and they have threatened a trade war with us
China is our number 1 trading partner, they can fuck us over economically in a heart beat, and with the Aussie dollar as bad as it is now, China is a serious threat
This time Poland will do the partitioning now
Pavlova wasn't invented by Australia or New Zealand, most evidence supports it being an American invention
Not stopping us from claiming it though
If fast internet is a requirement, count your lucky stars you don't live in Australia
Mass murder is never "incredibly good" in any scenario
I would pay any amount of money to have an assassin's creed game in Colonial Australia
Assassin bush rangers would be the coolest fucking thing, Ned Kelly would certainly be a character
Man that would be sick, Weimar Germany was in such a state of flux, seems like a very interesting backdrop

Google it
German I can understand because I studied it, and about 30-40% of Dutch
I consider it to be halfway between English and German
North Germanics I'm lost, only certain Norse words/phrases
I am assuming he meant Brazilian Portuguese
Where are the majority of Scottish Gaelic speakers based
Also is there much local government support for the language
Existing outside of a city
Oh good, I always wanted to go to camp as a child
You're all going to hell for this
^^please^continue
Not European , however there is a small group here called ‘Republicans’ such as myself who wants Australia to be an independent republic from the Commonwealth
In 1999 there was a referendum on whether we should become a republic or not and the majority of people voted no
Not European but Western Australia did a vote for independence once, they voted No obviously but since then there haven't been any such movements
Apart from Lord Howe Island wanting to be part of New Zealand instead of Australia
We did try and change the name of our money to dollarydoos once
>a lot of people that want Scottish independence
But didn't they already vote against that literally a few months ago
Fuck, it's been that long already
But if it took them 307 years to get 49% of people on the side of becoming independent, a rate of 0
15960912% per year then 6 years is only an extra 0
95765472% which is still 1
04234528% short of the majority needed
Though best reports I found rounded numbers to 49% vs 51% and I'm assuming that everyone in 1707 wanted to be part of the UK, which I know there was likely always a simmering independence movement below the surface
But still, it took 307 years to get the first vote, and it failed, would it be wise 6 years later to have another one so soon
Yeah so it's still another 20 or more years away at this point
Cunt (friend/mate)
Cunt(insult)
The th is almost silent when I say it
But you can hear it just a little bit
But yes, many natives struggle with this one
Thankfully it's a word that is extremely rare to actually say
The good thing about English is even if you use the wrong stress, you will still easily be understood
So I wouldn't worry too much
Just go with whatever feels natural
There are some words that are stressed differently between various countries as well
I've heard people pronounce it 'arch', but the first syllable is actually 'ark'
That's considered lower class to do that though
This is anther one that varies by dialect
Funnily enough, when some Americans say 'height', it can sound like they're saying 'hate' to us
The vowels are slightly different
>Pronounced something like Hedge-eh-mehni, but for the longest I said hedge-a-moany
I'm pretty sure in some dialects that would be considered correct
It's like the word ceremony, Brits say 'SEH-reh-mehni', whereas in Australia (and North America too I think) it's Seh-re-MOANY (capitals for stress)
Is that where they mine the cheese
How deep do they have to dig

Heaven is what I picture as a sanctuary of the dead, like my deceased mum

Aren't the animals a problem
Are you immune to venom
Have you been bitten by a spider before
FYI: Nobody has died from a spider bite since the 70s, and most of the snakes are really chill, they just sort of stare at you for 30 seconds and then they piss off
Not brown snakes though, brown snakes are cunts and they will kill you on sight
A common past time in Australia is bullying Americans by convincing them we ride kangaroos to school, or teach them about drop bears
Sorry about that
Nah, the only people you'll find riding crocodiles are in the Northern Territory and far north Queensland
If you want we can send some snakes over
We have way too many here
Don't worry most of them are pretty chill, except the brown ones, they're cunts
Not European but Australian: but I love this thread so much I just had to contribute

What is the most beautiful sounding language that you have heard
For me, I find the Slovenian and Persian (Farsi) languages particularly beautiful
That Aboriginals (Australia) were already dying out when the British invaded and that if you really think about it “the British saved them”.
He was an absolute dipshit
Saying that all of Russia was in Asia, Papua New Guinea was a sole island, that we’re going to run out of water (then I mentioned de-salination and she said it’s “to advanced a concept”) As you can probably tell I’ve had horrible geography teachers, also yes I corrected them, but they rejected my ideas
Was the teacher a feminist
Australia's convict heritage is over exaggerated a lot
I could see how he could have been tricked into thinking that

I reckon for England Wilfred Owen’s last line in Dulce et Decorum would be it

“I love a sunburnt country” - although it was quoted rather sardonically at the end of last year, start of this year, for obvious reasons
Welsh words are very handy in scrabble, I think cwm is one that's allowed
I also love the word for microwave
Not European but New Zealand and Australia have alot of banter
But it stops being banter once is reaches the "Pavlova debate". We invented it btw fuck off Kiwis
Righto, drain German
Maybe commonwealth countries
ANZAC is definitely wrong here unless discussing biscuits or war
Yes, about 10 minutes from me there's a Polish shop, bakery and restaurant
Even closer is just a general deli that sells a lot of European goods; mainly Polish, Czech, Balkans and Italian
Also Polish newspapers and alcohol
I think the owner is Polish tbf
I buy frozen pierogi from there, cabbage and mushroom- it's not bad as far as frozen food goes
Also ptasie mleczko I have a taste for since my time in Poland heh
In general though my specific area has a small Polish community; a local soccer club called "White Star" with a badge similar to Wisła Kraków, and a local Polish school and community hall called Syrena
Not From Europe but definitely the Netherlands
I love that country in general
Always better in the retelling
I know the UK's and obviously recognise the French when i hear it but don't know the words
I know the Irish anthem in Irish and English
Hmm not sure I'm too familiar with any others in Europe
I know the beginning of the French anthem thanks to the Beatles
I think this is the norm in every English-speaking country
Seeing $1
200,99 looks really weird to me
In Australia it's always $1,200
It was about 30% in our last census (2016)
Another survey in 2017 showed about 52% of teens have no religion
So we’ll probably catch up to you guys soon
Jesus where do I start
Scott Morrison, Prime Minister of Australia, leader of the Liberal party (right wing, not the left wing liberals in America), professional retard
- Name abbreviated as "Scomo"
- Often depicted wearing a lai and Hawaiian shirt due to his absence from the bushfire crisis because he decided to go on holiday in Hawaii in middle of it
- Often called "Smoko" because Smoko is Aussie slang for a work break and it rhymes with Scomo
- Depicted having romantic relations with a lump of coal due to the fact he is a climate change denier and brought a lump of coal into Parliament and said "Don't be afraid it's just a rock
" And is highly against renewable energy
- In 1997 he shat himself at a Maccas (McDonalds) in Engadine, South Sydney
This is often brought up in conversation about Scomo and he has not confirmed or denied it
He is the joke
idk dude I know some eastern European people whose eyebrows can't go up if they try and Greeks whose skin is plump and wrinkle free well into their 50s - I wouldn't be surprised if literally anybody had botox but it's not necessary to explain a Greek not having wrinkles
still better than my Greek
Δεν έχω κρασί στο ξενοδόχοι.
Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and German
All useful, and I feel I have no hope in hell of learning the first two since they have no English (alphabet
) characters
German also looks very tough
Emboldened by this, I would take a French class, after which I think learning Spanish would be easier (than it would have been previously
French - already learning but it would relieve me of more years of work
Indonesian - see above
Chinese - to make visiting China, Malaysia and Singapore easier and more fun
Lots of people to speak Chinese with in Australia, too
I know it’s r/askeurope but love this sub ... and I originated in Europe
Prolly German, Japanese and French
from i consume a lot of Japanese content and if i wanted to with a Japanese base i could go on to learn Korean fairly easily and German is interesting, same as (though not as much as German and Japanese to me) French but with a French base i could learn Italian and Spanish (or Romanian) fairly easily
Don't be a cunt
There's only a handful of countries in the entire world that have unarmed police
You can read it on wiki
It’s odd that Europeans are taught that Oceania is the continent
I was under the assumption to be considered a continent, everything had to be part of one continuous, large land mass
Here we’re taught the continents are Australia, Asia, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe and Africa
I'm Australia we're taught that Australia is its own continent, but Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and a few other island nations like Tonga and Nauru are part of a REGION called Oceania, not a continent
We're also taught that North and South America are seperated, infact this post is the first I've heard of them being called 1 continent
TL:DR Australia is its own continent, Oceania is a region, North and South America are seperated
We call it Australasia
I was under the assumption you have the bigger land masses and whichever mass the islands are closest to is the continent it’s associated with
Kinda like how Japan is an island but it’s closest to Asia so it’s part of that continent
But to be perfectly honest, Google gives conflicting information about pretty much all of it in that if you just straight Google the word Australia, it says it’s a continent but then if you Google New Zealand it claims it’s part of Oceania but also not part of it and if you Google Oceania it says it’s a continent but also not a continent and instead a geographical region
Now I kinda wanna know what Kiwi’s are taught
Just describing how it was taught to me
What did they teach you that a continent was
And I stated what my school said
Then my explanation was questioned so I did research which is what typically happens when trying to draw a conclusion with several conflicting opinions
But yes, different strokes for different folks which is fine
No we were taught they were part of Europe it’s just the islands around us were considered part of the continent of Australia if that makes sense

That's about it, we don't have a very extensive history
Australian here
We know Kosciusko much better than most people would think, that's because the tallest mountain in our country/island/continent is named after him
Mount Kosciusko is around 2,228 metres tall, and was *"discovered" and named by the Polish explorer Pawel Strzelecki
I've been to the summit myself, very windy, nice view for around 3 seconds before it's covered by cloud and fog again for another 3 minutes
* I say discovered loosely because the Native Aboriginal Australians have knows about it for around 60,000 years, so it would be more appropriate to say "discovered by Europeans"
Most of the more progressive people in Australia want it to be given an Aboriginal name instead of a Polish one
Theres 2 problems that I see with this however:
1) The proposed name for it (Which I don't remember) means faeces in a different Aboriginal language
2) From what I know, the Aboriginal nation of the Kosciusko area didn't even have their own name for it, probably because despite it being the highest point in the country, it doesn't really stand out, it looks more like a big hill
(When I got to the top, I remember thinking "Is that it
", I was quite dissapointed to be honest)
I don't think that the Polish name will be removed entirely, it's more likely that it will have a dual name, as with most other geographical landmarks in Australia (For example: Uluru is also called Eyre's Rock)
Yup, the Great Vowel Shift really screwed the English writing system, and even worse, the people in charge decided not to update the spelling
If you listen to older English, the silent letters make sense because they used to actually be pronounced, and the vowels were pronounced consistently
And now because English is the international language, and spoken all over the world, it's gonna pretty much be impossible to update the writing system and to get everyone in every country to agree to it
Many native speakers would be totally against changing it
I think it's frozen in time now
Also They, they has always been a neuter option for ages
It is only controversial because people learn it as the plural but you probably use they all the time e.g, who left THEIR bag here
North Territory becomes a state, South Australia is demoted to a territory, Perth becomes a ghost town and Broome becomes a huge city
Queensland becomes the new incest and vegan hotspot, and the Aboriginal population finally returns to Tasmania
Not much else changed on the East Coast
Meanwhile, Alice Springs is confused about what the fuck is happening with the rest of the country

Fun hurling story; my mum is Irish and my dad always trots out the same joke any time someone mentions hurling; "to be a hurler you need knobbly knees and no front teeth
" Which sort of fit the description of her grandfather
Anyway I was in a pub in Belfast, and this bloke told me he used to hurl for Antrim; so I repeated the above to him and he turned his head towards me, and without saying a word removed his two front teeth
And even in the English-speaking world, I think this is just an American thing
I've never heard of a "spelling bee" in Australia or NZ
As with many things in America it seems, you take something relatively normal and useful, and turn it up to 11 as a competition
Honestly, I still think French is more consistent with spelling than English
Once you know the rules, it's pretty easy to guess how something is written and/or pronounced
You're right
They're extremely rare words in the most recent years, and I've not heard of a single one of them
I looked at some of the earlier years and obviously knew a lot of those
There's German words in there that I've never heard being used in English
>Its a country where they promote competitiveness and make a competition out of everything, even if it's knife forging or cupcake decorating
Stressful, isn't it
I don't think promoting competitiveness is necessarily a bad thing
I think this is maybe where Australians/Americans etc have a different mindset to Europeans (although as per usual, Americans have to take the concept to the extreme)
But it's why the US is #1 at so many things
I just think it's a weird thing to want to make a televised competition out of
Ok, well I'm not surprised about that
They're basically Americans, but not as extreme and with a Commonwealth style of governance
Well, to be fair, they're usually nerds that love that kinda thing
But I get what you're saying
It would be the equivalent of you guys with a Germanic loanword, which I assume you guys have
To this day, I've not heard of those two words lol
That's how foreign and obscure many of these words are to most native speakers, even to those with higher university level education
No, you're not wrong
I'm a native speaker, and kamikaze is that most recent one that I know (and possibly démarche from 2000, it sounds *vaguely* familiar, but I'm not sure)
My auto correct added that accent, so it must be in the dictionary and 'official'. And I only knew kamikaze as a kid because it was a ride at our local fair
Yup
I can go between NZ and Australia and barely feel like I'm in a different country
It's mostly the scenery that's different, but their suburbs/cities/cars and roads/social structure/economic structure/sports etc is almost the same
uisce (beatha) ?
Yes, there are similarities between the English-speaking countries
I've been to the US, and it definitely felt foreign (but somewhat familiar) to me
Too many differences
That doesn't happen when I go to NZ of course
I've never been to the UK, but I feel like the UK wouldn't feel as foreign to me as the US/Canada do

Growing up to Australia, the best school trip I ever got was to our capital city right before primary school graduation, which required a plane trip as it was further away from my city (not even in the north geographically) than Berlin is to Paris
It's so easy to cross borders within the Schengen zone, so you become quite accustomed to not even thinking about it
And then you completely forget to take your passport when you want to cross a non-Schengen border
Don't ask me how I know this

All that kinda thing does is increase car dependence
Look at how fcked up the US is
How clean are they in the US
And build over all that beautiful nature
No offence but I find that Italians tend to be pretty parochial about your food lol
Upside of that meant each region of Italy had an amazing unique dish
Downside would be that other then a Macca’s or shitty sushi there wasn’t really much in the way of food places that sold foods from other cuisines
Actually missed getting a good roast lunch from a good old fashioned carvery when I lived in Italy lol
I refuse to believe that most US public toilets are too disgusting
There are free public toilets
In Australia as well and they’re mostly guaranteed to be clean
I would happily pay 50c for a nice clean usable bathroom
If that's the cost to keep it clean and for maintenance, then I think it's fair
Prefer to pay than have a free one where it's absolutely disgusting to use cause no money is being spent on upkeep/cleaning
I know
And they're totally oblivious to it as well
Use the urban spaces you already have more efficiently
France is a lot more densely populated than Sweden
So a lot less undisturbed nature
Do they really want hundreds/thousands of people wrecking whatever they have left
I can kinda see why France does
Ah sorry Macca’s is a slang term for McDonald’s lol
Also I think when you have access to so many different cuisines, your bowels tend to get used to different foods
That being said a vindaloo can fuck me up if I haven’t been eating curries lately lmao
The problem with electric bikes in many places is not having somewhere to park it where it won't get stolen

One of our prime ministers went missing at sea and straight up dissapeared
Still haven't found a trace of him
As an Australian, we are also a bunch of bloody foreigners
Lemmino has [a great video] on this
Nope, he just went for a swim and didn't come back
In fact, Harold Holt was an extremely experienced swimmer, so it's not like it would be easy for him to go missing
He was so experienced that we named a public swimming pool after him after he dissapeared
That theory comes from a book called "The Prime Minister was a spy" by Anthony Grey, a book that is riddled with inaccuracies and factual errors, including but not limited to; the impossibility of a submarine coming that close to the shore, and that according to Harold's wife, he didn't even like Chinese food
Can confirm, but I think we're foreigners for much more sinister and colonial reasons
It's an anomaly in history that's never quite explained properly
I guess your government are payed actors in a drama show called “Brexit Blues”
I mean, Australian politics is really boring, I don't think anyone had a reason to want to assassinate him, and the Chinese spy/submarine theory is just plain stupid to me
Just because he was an experienced swimmer, doesn't mean it's IMPOSSIBLE for him to have drowned, so I think that's what happened
Besides, this is Australia, we have far more than our fair share of ocean dwelling shit that will kill you in minutes
In Australia, ALL our waters are infested with atleast something, you just need to either take the right precautions or just gamble with your life
Your chances of dying are surprisingly lower than one would immediately think
From what I remember from reading about his death, the waters were calm, I could be wrong though
Just because there's stuff in it that can kill you, doesn't mean it's going to kill you
Under your logic, a rooster, which has the capability to kill a human under certain circumstances, will 100% kill you if it sees you
What I'm trying to say is, most of the animals in Australia are extremely poisonous and deadly, but that doesn't mean they ALWAYS attempt to kill humans
For example: The Sydney Funnel Web Spider, the most venomous spider in the world, has only killed 13 people
And ALL of those deaths occurred BEFORE the 1980s. Nobody has died to a funnel web since
Just because it CAN kill you, doesn't necessarily mean it WANTS to kill you
And vice-versa
Correct
Quokkas do certainly appear friendly but one can never know their true intentions

Ok going a bit far with long pants and hoodie for me
Queenslander or Darwinian
I'm in Melbourne
The long pants and hoodie is just someone experienced, knowing fully well that the 25 can change to 15 in a matter of minutes
Today it’s 25 c in Perth and I’m wearing long sleeves and pants
Oh, Melbourne, that makes sense
I could do it with a stiff breeze, but not when it’s just pure sun belting down
Depends on humidity as well
22 today on the Illawarra coast, jeans and a tshirt for me
Perfect
Just beautiful
Sure
Where we are positioned, the weather can be very erratic
One day it can be 40 during the day, cool change in the evening can drop down to 20 in an hour or so
Sudden drops lead to hail and heavy rains
November to March expect 30 or more during the day
Not always, but always be ready for it
Right not it's spring
Nights and mornings can be below 10 during the day low 20s.
Also different people take the weather differently
Someone from north Queensland (tropical part) would find Melbourne weather on the cool side
25 for them is long sleeve, for me it's a t-shirt
In the winter, there will be mornings with frost on the grass and cars

Independent in every single way except for when you elect a slightly left-leaning prime minister, in which case the governer-general and the Queen of England coup them

Is "let's get fucked up" much of a thing into young Italians 20s? Or is it usually just people who've just become of drinking age
Well the first 50,000 years is the hardest so we skim very lightly over that
The next 100 years is the second hardest so that's covered pretty lightly too
Actually we suck at history, I've learned more from podcasts than I learned in school
50,000 years old country checking in to say "we all have different replies to this comment but there's no doubt it's a good one"
Not in Europe but just for some more data, here in Australia you legally have to be at school until 16 and can only leave on the condition that you get an apprenticeship or some other kind of continued study that goes for a minimum of one year and they supposedly check up on you and fine you if you aren't doing one of those
If you stay at school you can leave at 17 and dont have to do a final exam (there's trial exams but school drop outs don't usually do them since they are trials for the final exam the next year) if you leave at this time you don't get your high school certificate
The final year is when you turn 18 and there are final exams with a state wide ranking system for students who intend to go to uni, if you only want to get your highschool certificate, you just need to show up for your exams (your grading is weighted on your whole year of assignments/exams/class work so you don't usually even have to write anything in your final exam as it's pretty easy to get a pass mark)
About half of the students would stay till they finish the final year for the highschool certificate as many jobs that don't need a degree would at least require HS certificate but many leave at 17, usually the type of people who struggle with classroom based education (most people don't leave at 16 as they have basically have to commit to a career (and usually stick with that specific trade too) 2 years before their classmates do when they choose a degree)
This is all based on a starting age of 5 turning 6 that year (we start our school year at the start of the actual year) which is most typical but it's not uncommon to start a year earlier (or even two years earlier for some smarties) as there's no real rule about it, just when your kid is developed enough for school
Skipping and repeating years is also not uncommon so you can get a mix of people from 17 - 19 in your final year (although usually if someone has repeated a grade they probably would drop out earlier), a guy in the grade above me was really smart and finished at 16 although I think it was a special case
So school for the vast majority of students planning to go to uni is 13 years unless you skip a year or are held back (which can't be forced, usually the school/teacher talks to the parents and tells them it would be beneficial if their child repeats the year so they don't fall behind)
All this is based on NSW and I'm not too sure about the other states (I think QLD don't have Kindergarten) but I don't think they vary too far from this

The CSIRO (Australia's national science agency) invented WIFI

Are there any places in your country with boring, obvious or bland names
Australia is known for having very bland names for slot of places
Prime example would be most of our states and territories: Western Australia, South Australia, Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory
The only "interesting" names would be Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania
And how can I forget, the only place in Australia where snow can be found year round: The Snowy Mountains
That's very dissatisfying

There's a bit more Delft-related fuckery
A harbour was built on the edge of Rotterdam in order to serve Delft, and the area's now Delfshaven
Then the Schie river was split into four - Delftse Schie, Delfshavense Schie, Rotterdamse Schie and Schiedamse Schie; Schiedam was formed on the Schie just like Amsterdam on the Amstel
I find it all fairly fascinating
I guess thats the same thing with English town names that end with town and ville (Campbelltown, Skyville, etc) and in Russia some places end with grad (Leningrad, Stalingrad, etc)
Very interesting how so many cultures have adopted this method of naming
Yeah but there were a lot of Polish explorers and they had the right to name whatever they found after whoever they liked
Coincidentally, we also have a city called Newcastle just north of Sydney
I believe Britain has one as well if I'm not mistaken
Don't forget Woodenbong, Humpty Doo, the little known Butt of Liberty or my favourite, Nar Nar Goon

Most British colonised towns and cities adopt the names of British ones
Australia has a city called Perth, and I believe New Zealand as well as Australia have cities called Newcastle

Cons: It's not in europe
Hmm as an Aussie I’d say yeah I’m ethnically European,  and our culture obviously is very European but that’s not the full story about Australia and I guess I could say the same for most of the Anglosphere
I’ve lived in Europe and I can say with confidence that I don’t feel European at all,  even when I was in England
We have moved on from Europe,  and while the ties to Europe is strong in Australia, we’ve forged our own identity and the forging of that identity was influenced not just by Europe but Asia and the Indigenous people here
I also know that New Zealand or Aotearoa has had the same case in forging their cultural identity too
Eh kinda,  but not quite
Some aspects we’re similar to the yanks, and in other aspects the USA might as well be another planet with the weirdo bullshit

Greetings from Australia
I find it interesting that nobody has said anything about different expectations of acceptable behaviour with same vs opposite sex friends
Obviously it works slightly differently for same sex attracted people and I'm bi so the orientation of the friend plays a role too, but for example I'm more comfortable socialising with opposite sex friends in a group or casual setting
Also if you've got a partner,  it's not ok to have close opposite sex friends that your partner doesn't know very well, so if you start dating someone new you might stop meeting your opposite sex friends one on one for a while until your new partner feels comfortable
The thing is defining a country and its founding in specific terms for centuries past is a fraught endeavour, because the modern iteration of a 'nation state' as it is understood today has really only been a thing since the 19th century or so
That's also a reason why I'd consider the occasional talking points that pop up like; 'Ireland was never a unified country until it was under British control,' to be a bad faith argument
Totally opposed to it

Wasn't it given up to preserve Ukrainian sovereignty and territory, but the Russians have basically reneged now anyway
Yes but no
In fact not only is the language rarely preserved in Australia, but Irish as an "ethnic identity" usually is faded after the 2nd or 3rd generation
Not like the Boston Irish where the identity can last many generations

Although, I will use my heritage and use the word "craic" I love it

My favourite WWI story is about the Mephisto
The short version: A bunch of Aussie mad lads saw a broken down, unusable German tank in the middle of no man's land and thought "Damn that tank is useless but it would be really cool if we captured it and brought it back anyway as a trophy
" And thats exactly what they did
Plus they had German machine guns firing on them the whole time and had 0 casualties
And that tank ended being the last of its kind and still sits in the Brisbane war museum
You have all heard of the Emu war already, but another interesting thing that happened during that time in the 1930s: Chariot racing, but they used motorbikes instead of horses
In this case, a primitive tank was named after him
Most of our country is already a wasteland
r/cursedcomments
The emu war was lost because emu's disperse and run away in all directions when fired at with machine guns
Also they take a lot of bullets to kill
(An emu hit by a truck after the war was found with 5 bullets in its flesh and still alive
It's obvious to most people but I have met some people that believe we are still part of Britain

I smash toasties here in Australia, and never thought anything of the fact that my mum as always cooked them, and she is polish
I honestly can’t think of any examples for Australia
Maybe the closest one would be how the British treated the ANZAC’s during WWI
How did they try to present it as preserving Polish way of life
The post-partition end result of having Polish territory and peoples split between three nations seems like a big impediment to that

Ikea needs to add this to their stores
Śmigus Dyngus
Ned Kelly
So he just didn't like America
Was it about the food
The music
Did he want to be king of the movie stars
I suspect it could but I'm not an angry Dutch mob in 1672 so what would I know
I use it with the line but I’d say an overwhelming majority of Australians do not
In Serbia middle names such as ones that are given (in english and other languages) don’ t really exist
However sometimes your fathers first name can be used as a “middle name”.
Define "good" and "modern".
This was built in the 60s.
This was built in 2020 (it is entirely new)
That's why I was wanting clarification on the terms "good" and "modern"!
Easily the Sydney Opera House,
It's impressive how much money can be spent to achieve so little
You don't have to put an arm out or anything, just eye contact

I had a lot of trouble when my glasses were old where I would have to stare down bus until it was about 20m away and then turn away or raise my hand
A lot of drivers would glare at me for giving mixed messages but I just couldn't make out their number
Australia stopped giving dual citizenships a few years ago, which I find absurd considering how many people with dual citizenships already live here
It's one of the most culturally diverse countries on Earth
New Zealand, only we are allowed to make fun of them
Ahh, Spoken like a true Swiss
Well fuck,  I’ll need to go do some proper lessons then
I want tp relearn Italian because I used to be able to speak Italian; but because my native language is English I just never had a reason to use Italian and basically lost all fluency
Now all I can do is shout out very specific Italian phrases and swear words like a child
In Western Sydney, there have been many sightings of a panther
Yes, a black panther
Stories vary but the main idea is that a panther escaped from a circus a long time ago and bred with feral cats
Monsters can’t compete with Russians
So do we mate
BYOD stands for bring your own drinks, it's actually great because then you can bring what you like to drink to the party
Also alcohol is heavily taxed, so like a 1
5 litre bottle of rum will run about 80 dollars, now imagine pitching in for everyone
Ceiling fans are commonplace in schools here
They're common in houses aswell though
Lol in Australia pretty much every school classroom (at least from PREP to grade 6) has people’s birthdays on the wall and the birthday boy/girl brings in cakes or ice cream for the whole class
Good times
Same in Australia, unless you got some super cheap/old stuff
It’s like they can’t read T’s
Coming from a country with a binge drinking culture, yeah, we bring our own to parties unless  specified not to
Question, why wouldn't it be feminine
In most other languages words ending in -a are almost always feminine
>Usually, words ended in -a are femenine, and words ended in -o or -e ar masculine
*El Dia* and *La noche* would like a word
Cases are a freakin nightmare
One of the reasons I gave up trying to learn Russian
Articles are so much more simpler
Being upside down
It's funny alot of the time but it's really sad when you find people dumb enough to think it's literal
>Meh, I don't think the knife wielding is that well known stereotype beyond scandinavia
I worked with two Finnish dudes in Australia, and both of them fit the stereotype
Small sample size, but in my case very accurate
Yeah that one gets annoying as well, half the venemous animals here haven't even killed anybody on record here, or at least not killed in a very long time
E.g. nobody has died from a spider bite since the 70s.
Usually when a foreigner mentions the animals, we warn them about the drop bears *wink wink*
Thank you
I hope your day is great even without cake
In the low 20s for me
But my husbands fine at about 15
I left Poland 30 years ago but Piłsudski was quite popular
Still is with my parents
I only came for Lady Godiva and you let me down
> She started an all woman paramilitary organisation to fight for independence
Is that Cumann na mBan, specifically
Sorry to tell you this, but she's about as real as Robin Hood
How old are you
I only find it interesting because  my grandfather also fought in WW2 and is still alive, and my great grandfather was a prisoner in ww1 and involved in the polish resistance, and I'm still only in high school
Yep, he's 91 years old this year and has had quite the interesting life
He was born in the Polish republic in 1928, taken prisoner by the Nazis as a teenager, and then liberated by the French Resiatance
He signed up as a tank gunner with the 1st polish armored division and was injured in battle and recovered in Scotland
By the time he was fit again the war had ended, so he spent the next few years with the British army
After that he moved to London, got a job driving the red London buses, married an Irishwoman, and had my dad in '65
Eventually they moved to Australia which is where I was born in 2001
He lives in a retirement village now, and is still remarkably physically and mentally fit for someone of his age
And interestingly, since my father was born in the UK I'm fairly certain that makes me a British citizen too
Robbie Williams is a household name in Europe but in the US barely anyone knows who he is
Finding that out was so crazy to me
A few weeks ago there were massive fires and many people were evacuated, well some people took advantage of this and decided to dress up as firemen telling people to evacuate, then proceeding to rob their house once they’re gone
The Eureka stockade flag, it came from a very short lived revolution during the Victorian Gold Rush, a bunch of gold miners rebelled and fought against the British government because they didn't want to get a license to mine gold
Nowadays it's been used as a symbol of Fascism even though it's history has NOTHING to do with Facism
Australian answer: Literally every city other than Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra
European Answer: East Coast Italy doesn’t get enough recognition; Rimini, Bari, Taranto
Most people outside of Australia I have met think that Sydney is our capital city, it isn't, it's Canberra
Canberra is slot smaller than Sydney and Melbourne, but it is such a boring fucking city, I am honestly jealous of foreigners who have never heard of the place
Turin has that famous Egyptian museum
I’d have thought Genova would be a large city most people wouldn’t know about lol
Lived in Genova for a year,  Liguria is absolutely one of the most beautiful parts of the world and Genova was a really nice city
Best dish I ever had in Italy was a Ligurian rabbit stew,  fuck it was amazing
Brisi
Or Gold Coast
Surely folks know about Cardiff and Belfast
Scotland is cheating ;)
I think of alice springs more as a big town ahah
It’s not very big (especially considering American desert cities like Phoenix or Las Vegas)
Nah mate I wouldn’t be surprised if Adelaide got more international recognition than Brisbane lol
I don’t know how but my hometown managed to become a big fuck off city yet is still obscure somehow
We Brisbanites probably don’t do a good job promoting our city
Besides Brisbane is kinda overshadowed by the Sunny Coast and Gold Coast
Austria is the least known part of Australia
Even though it’s basically in the title
Perth aus is a really wonderful city
It’s also in the most bio diverse corner of Australia
This exists in Australia too but I don't think it's regional and it seems like dinner is taking over anyway
Perhaps this is an Australian thing, but "Americans know shit" comes off as more, "Americans are knowledgeable on this", whereas I think what you were trying to express would be better said as, "Americans know shit all".
Other native English speakers feel free to correct me
Yeah, 'fuck all' or 'jack shit' rather than 'shit all'.
Where do I start
Fake Aussie accents are horrific
The only people who live in the desert are Aboriginals (Native Australians) and cattle farmers
Not everything with a heartbeat will kill you
(Nobody has died from a spider bite since the 70s)
Not everything is desert (Just look at a fucking map)
We have cities (Again, look at a fucking map)
And not everybody wears an acubra
(I do though because they are cool
I collect pins and bird feathers for mine, it's awesome
I get many compliments about my hat
Here it is
Thankyou
I have had it for many years, it's my favourite thing
We sometimes call people from New Zealand, "Kiwi's" (Think they call themselves that as well) but most of the time we call them Sheep Fuckers
We also call British people "Pommy", which comes from Pomegranate which rhymes with immigrant
My mum used to call Czechs and Slovaks 'pepiczki'...I never thought I'd see something similar posted
ever
We're just taught mostly about the battles and the holocaust
We don't learn much about the second world war
It's really just all about the Gallipoli campaign
Literally
Only
Gallipoli
Idk, there is no history
Australia being similar to New Zealand, chicken is most common and everything else is pretty rare, but in some very (very) rural areas, emu meat isn't an uncommon sight
Have you tried emu
If you have, you'll realise why it's not commonly eaten in Australia
I often find thar foreigners will do a shitty imitation of an Aussie accent and say "Throw anotha shrimp on the barbie
" To which I politely remind them that "***NOBODY IN AUSTRALIA EATS FUCKING SHRIMP WE EAT PRAWNS YOU DIMWITTED CUNT***"
Kiwis don't mock our accents though, we mock theirs and call them sheepfuckers
"Fush en chups"
Me and one of my friends have been trying to teach our Swedish friend to pronounce the letter J, when talking to my friend she always calls him "Yack" instead of "Jack".
We've discovered that she can only pronounce the letter J when she pronounces the G in the word "Charger" but we can't get her to make that sound in any other word
One of my mates has a very strong British accent, you would think we would bully him about it but NO, he is the one that starts arguments with us on how to pronounce the word "herb" (He thinks the H is silent so it's supposed to sound like "erb")
The joke was on him though once we found out he was a furry
It's very strange thinking about the different sounds in languages, you think you know all the sounds until you try to pronounce a foreign word and nearly summon a demon
You'd really like Melbourne (Australia) then
this comment speaks to me though I don't listen to black metal
Might have something to do with that's where our queen lives
It's actually POHM (prison of her majesty)
Very common
We all know bacteria is the preferred pet of choice for every European
Sorry for my ignorance but I thought saami is what you called “Finnish”
What’s your word for Finnish then
We are SUPPOSED to be able to get around without a car but Sydney transport is a fucking joke and has problems with the train and the new self driving metro system every 10 minutes
Why don't they just use the subways built by the ancient Romans
Those guys were amazing engineers
I've seen reports that in the north, as areas that had permafrost or always covered in ice begin to warm, there are interesting finds
But anything organic that has been "deep-frozen" will quickly decay
It's a race against time to find stuff as the ice recedes
Australia has these things called Opal Cards
You store money on them and then you can just tap them a scanner when getting on and off a bus or train
Can we mention Father Ted
Or quote anything from it
I’ve been to Luxembourg and a lot of responses from got from friends were “I thought that was a German city”
Germany starts demanding other countries food, they give it to him to get him to shuttup but then he starts demanding more and eventually starts a massive food fight
I think Britain would agree with you, and wanted to leave until they remembered all they have in the fridge at home is pickles and mayonnaise
Also you guys invented the Cyrillic alphabet, it wasn't Russia (Which some people seem to think they did)
Best fish and chips in the world
Some people call you guys slavs
Linguistically that obviously isn't the case, but from a cultural standpoint there may be some similarities to your neighbouring countries
How often do you go to the dentist
And what's the average in your country
I usually go 2-3 times a year for a checkup and clean
Wondering how it is in Europe
Edit: this can also include dental hygienists
I like to keep them in good shape and I admittedly don't clean them as thoroughly and as regularly as I should
Plus it's all covered by my insurance anyway
Hasn't been so regular lately though, due to covid
You're asking for problems later on, just so you know
>(which is done by an hygienist but in the same clinic as the actual dentist one, so "going to the dentist" sometimes refers to the clinic and not to the professional
Same here
I would definitely count seeing a hygienist as a 'dental visit'
You quite often can't see what's going on inside the teeth
That's why checkups (with x-ray) are important, at least every couple of years
Same here
Some of the larger places have hygienists, but all my dentists have done my cleanings
>only removes tartar (is this the right word
Yes it is, although I've noticed dentists use the word 'calculus' for it now, so it's replacing the word "tartar', at least here where I live
>I can barely put food on the table
Fair enough
Although I'm surprised to hear this, considering you're from Norway
It’s amazing how quickly people shut up when you correct them about your nationality after over hearing them rant about you lol
Happened to me when I was in Italy lmao
People get super embarrassed
Not European but the song "Treaty" by Youthu Yindi is mostly in English but incorporates Aboriginal (Native Australian peoples) languages and instruments
It's a song about the oppression and land seizure of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers
Probably George Pell's trial(s)
He was a Vatican Cardinal living in Melbourne, Australia
He was accused of sexually abusing and harrassing children in the 90s.
He didn't spend long in prison though, that cunt bastard and the rich fuckers in the Vatican managed to spend enough of their hoarded wealth to get him out
lotta people in a smol area and looks amazing from space at night
If I ever for some reason have to run and charge through a door or group of people, etc
I generally scream "BLITZKRIEG
" as loud as possible
My history teacher is less than impressed by my use of his teachings
Waltzing Matilda
Every Australian knows at least part of it, it's basically our unofficial anthem
Waltzing Matilda is the unofficial Australian national anthem
Thought it was either Moskau or 99 Luft Balloons
I love those songs as well
But I still think Waltzing is more well known and associated with Australian identity
Sounds of then - GANGajang and any Midnight Oil song are also good

When I talk to people about Amsterdam, I always lead with the fact it's a monument to architectural arrogance and recommend het Grachtenhuis museum to explain what I mean
It's a swamp, beaten into submission with more than the usual Dutch approach to aggressive terraforming
You've had one Austrian overlord, and that didn't turn out well
(Obviously I'm an English speaker) But I just now learnt that Australia is panvocalic so that's something cool
I like to use rhythm as a better example of this
Ohhh I see, thankyou
In English if you asked someone to name vowels they'll give you a e i o u 98% of the time
"Vowel sounds" is a better way to get across what you're describing, which practically goes unthought of in the Anglosphere unless you are learning another language
Lmao dude if the dictionary AND all native speakers disagree with your terminology maybe it's you who is uneducated
Vowel does not have the meaning you think it does in English
You are thinking of vowel sounds, maybe this is different in Polish, but it is not the case in English
[Here] is an example of an 'incorrect word' being defined in the dictionary
You should read the FAQ about that word
I think it will help you understand a bit more about prescriptive and descriptive dictionaries
Dictionaries primarily exist to convey what people mean when they say words, regardless (not the nonstandard irregardless) of whether you consider it proper
In the linguistics unit I took at university, the word vowel referred to letters and the phrase 'vowel sounds' was used to refer distinguish the two meanings
I'm not going to keep arguing with you, you should just know that when speaking English, that is not how people will interpret that word, so if you wish to use the language to communicate, there you go
Hey dad
Frankish empire, France winning the 100 year war, Revolution, Napoleonic era, World Wars
And when the British wanted a Dutch king to replace their own
Historic ones are the PLC, Unification of Poland by the Piasts
Modern ones are Congress Poland, Poland-Soviet war (Where Poland got Vilnius and half of Belarus and Ukraine until 1939)
The Duchy of Poland probably defined Poland along with the Lech/Czech/Rus legend
In a fresh Tulip broth
Not fond of food
Are you even French
My parents used to eat black/white pudding
I used to remember getting confused, cause I thought it was some sort of dessert
Best one out of Ireland I heard of, from the guy it happened to, was "turn right where the traffic lights used to be"
Start a cult
Don't forget to charge for membership
There are none in Finland
Complete opposite here
I think we have the most stores per capita in the world
It's more popular here than in the US
Not my thing though
Conversely, Australia has borders with Norway and France, but we consider them extremely foreign
you got it
I guess having an interest in Antarctica should imply we've got *something* in common culturally but I'm not really sure what
Can confirm
Spent a long time living in sydjylland and midtylland and let’s just say attitudes on most topics were the polar opposite to what I had experienced in Copenhagen
Lovely country though
Very easy place to live
Would you say a lot of this is generational as well
So it’s a multiplier of the urbanites x the younger generation voting left, and the rest voting right
I’ve always found the youth of Warsaw to be so progressive, so I was rather surprised when I saw the way people voted
Thank you for the response and the articulation
Really appreciate it
Western Australia had an independence movement a long time ago but it's mostly dead now
Closest thing I can think of now would Lord Howe island, which doesn't want independence, it just wants to be part of New Zealand instead of Australia
I don't blame them tbh
I have heard about Padania before, is this actually a movement or an overhyped political thing
I bet
Why do Danes love killing animals so much
I remember those stories about the zoo animals
And then there were the minks
It's like the China of Europe when it comes to treatment of animals
The gap between the way the royals/aristocracy/upper class speak and the way the 'commoners' speak is getting less and less each year
If you listen to the young royals speak, they do still sound well spoken and kinda posh, but it's not that different to the way other people speak now
Fairy bread
another Democrats = Right wing bullshit
They are centre to centre-left, except for the welfare part
Well thats whom I meant
You may not know, but how does DB compare to the TGV/SNCF
I only ask cause I assume being in Luxembourg, you're familiar with both countries
Are the TGV usually on time, or are they as bad as DB

To me Finnish sounds made up on the spot
I personally have a hard time hearing any sort of 'flow' or structure
It's hard to explain actually

I heard emotion and grunting with a few words in between
Don't get me wrong, the language looks fascinating, but I can't get past the sounds
Oh that's better
I can hear upward inflections at the end of words
Thanks for that
Why you asking me
I'm an Australian
When I was a kid I thought Spain was in Siberia and Bulgaria wasn't a country
Maybe he thought it was the Cape Verde of Portugal
Poland and Sweden did have a history
We heat up to 18 in winter and down to 24 in summer, though we only have one cooled/heated room in the house  so usually just use fans until it's over 40
I'm pretty sure there was an ad campaign on TV advocating either 24 or 25 for air con because it puts a huge strain on our electrical grid
when my dad was little and had been living here probably about a year, so probably around 1968, his aunty visited from back home and was shocked that the family had a barbecue and ate outside "like gypsies
same here, it's not fancy behaviour but who says we need to be fancy all the time anyway
Haha
Just "on the other hand" but as someone with a Spanish vocabulary of about a dozen words, although we don't have the phrase "other side" in English, I did understand exactly what it meant
"Australia is a very confusing place, taking up a large amount of the bottom half of the planet
It is recognisable from orbit because of
many unusual features, including what at first looks
like an enormous bite taken out of its southern edge; a wall of sheer cliffs which plunge deep into the girting sea
Geologists assure us that this is simply an accident of geomorphology and plate tectonics, but they still call it the "Great Australian Bight" proving that not only are they covering up a more frightening theory, but they can't spell either
The first of the confusing things about Australia is the status of the place
Where other land masses and sovereign lands are classified as either continent, island, or country, Australia is considered all
three
Typically, it is unique in this
The second confusing thing about Australia are the animals
They can be divided into three categories: Poisonous, Odd, and Sheep
It is true that of the 10 most poisonous arachnids on the planet, Australia has 9
of them
Actually, it would be more accurate to say that of the 9 most poisonous arachnids, Australia has all of them
However, there are curiously few snakes, possibly because the spiders have killed them all
But even the
spiders won't go near the sea
Any visitors should be careful to check inside boots (before putting them on) under toilet seats (before sitting down) and generally everywhere else
A stick is very useful for this task
Strangely, it tends to be the second class of
animals (the Odd) that are more dangerous
The creature that kills the most people each year is the
common Wombat
It is nearly as ridiculous as its name, and spends its life digging holes in the ground, in which it hides
During the night it comes out to eat worms and grubs
The wombat kills people in two ways: First, the
animal is indestructible
Digging holes in the hard
Australian clay builds muscles that outclass Olympic weightlifters
At night, they often wander the roads
Semi-trailers (Road Trains) have hit them at high speed, with all 9 wheels on one side, and this merely makes them very annoyed
They express this by snorting, glaring, and walking away
Alas, to smaller
cars, the wombat becomes an asymmetrical launching pad, with results that can be imagined, but not adequately described
The second way the wombat kills people relates to its burrowing behaviour
If a person happens to put their hand down a Wombat hole, the Wombat will feel the disturbance and think "Ho
My hole is collapsing
" at which it will brace its muscled legs and push up against the roof of its burrow with incredible force, to prevent its collapse
Any unfortunate hand will be crushed, and attempts to withdraw will cause the Wombat to simply bear down harder
The unfortunate will then bleed to death through their crushed hand as the wombat prevents him from seeking assistance
This is considered the third most embarrassing known way to die, and Australians don't talk about it much
At this point, we would like to mention the Platypus, estranged relative of the mammal, which has a duck-bill, otter's tail, webbed feet, lays eggs, detects its aquatic prey in the same way as the electric eel, and has venomous barbs attached to its hind legs,
thus combining all 'typical' Australian attributes into a single improbable creature
The last confusing thing about Australia is the
inhabitants
First, a short history: Some time around 40,000 years ago, some people arrived in boats from the north
They ate all the available food, and lots of them died
The ones that survived learned respect for the balance of nature, man's proper place in the scheme of things, and spiders
They settled in, and spent a lot of the intervening time making up strange stories
Then, around 200 years ago, Europeans arrived in boats from the north
More accurately, European convicts were sent, with a few deranged and stupid people in charge
They tried to plant their crops in Autumn(failing to take account of the reversal of the seasons when moving from the top half of the planet to the bottom), ate all their food, and a lot of them died
About then the sheep arrived, and have been treasured ever since
It is interesting to note here that the Europeans always consider themselves vastly superior to any other race they encounter, since they can lie,
cheat, steal, and litigate (marks of a civilised
culture they say) - whereas all the Aboriginals can do is happily survive being left in the middle of a vast red-hot desert, equipped with a stick
Eventually, the new lot of people stopped being
Europeans on Extended Holiday and became Australians
The changes are subtle, but deep, caused by the mind-stretching expanses of nothingness and eerie quiet, where a person can sit perfectly still and look deep
inside themselves to the core of their essence, their reasons for being, and the necessity of checking inside your boots every morning for fatal surprises
They also picked up the most finely tuned sense of irony in the world, and the Aboriginal gift for making up stories
Be warned
There is also the matter of the beaches
Australian beaches are simply the nicest and best in the entire world
Although anyone actually venturing into the sea will have to contend with sharks, stinging
jellyfish, stonefish (a fish which sits on the bottom of the sea, pretends to be a rock, and has venomous barbs sticking out of its back that will kill just from the pain) and surfboarders
However, watching a
beach sunset is worth the risk
As a result of all this hardship, dirt, thirst, and wombats, you would expect Australians to be a dour lot
Instead, they are genial, jolly, cheerful, and always willing to share a kind word with a stranger,
unless they are an American
Faced with insurmountable odds and impossible problems, they smile disarmingly and look for a stick
Major engineering feats have been performed with sheets of corrugated iron, string, and mud
Alone of all the races on earth, they seem to be free from the 'Grass is Greener on the other side of the fence' syndrome, and roundly proclaim that Australia is, in fact, the other side of that fence
They call the land "Oz", "Godzone" (a verbal contraction of
"God's Own Country") and "Best bloody place on earth, bar none, strewth
" The irritating thing about this is they may be right
There are some traps for the unsuspecting traveller, though
Do not under any circumstances suggest that the beer is imperfect, unless you are comparing it to another kind of Australian beer
Do not wear a
Hawaiian shirt
Religion and Politics are safe topics of conversation (Australians don't care too much about either) but Sport is a minefield
The only correct answer to "So, howdya' like our country, eh
" is "Best
{insert your own regional swear word here} country in the world
It is very likely that, on arriving, some cheerful Australians will 'adopt' you, and on your first night, and take you to a pub where Australian Beer is served
Despite the obvious danger, do not refuse
It is a form of initiation rite
You will wake up late the next day with an astonishing hangover, a foul-taste in your mouth, and wearing strange clothes
Your hosts will usually make sure you get home, and waive off
any legal difficulties with "It's his first time in Australia, so we took him to the pub
", to which the policeman will sagely nod and close his notebook
Be sure to tell the story of these events to every other
Australian you encounter, adding new embellishments at every stage, and noting how strong the beer was
Thus you will be accepted into this unique culture
Most Australians are now urban dwellers, having
discovered the primary use of electricity, which is air-conditioning and refrigerators
Typical Australian sayings
"G'Day
"It's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp
stick
"She'll be right
"And down from Kosciusko, where the pine clad ridges raise their torn and rugged battlements on high, where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze at midnight in the cold and frosty sky
And where, around the overflow, the reed beds sweep
and sway to the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide
The Man from Snowy River is a household word today, and the stockmen tell the story of his ride
Tips to Surviving Australia
Don't ever put your hand down a hole for any
reason whatsoever
We mean it
The beer is stronger than you think, regardless of how strong you think it is
Always carry a stick
Air-conditioning
Do not attempt to use Australian slang, unless you are a trained linguist and good in a fistfight
Thick socks
Take good maps
Stopping to ask directions only works when there are people nearby
If you leave the urban areas, carry several litres of water with you at all times, or you will die
Even in the most embellished stories told by
Australians, there is always a core of truth that it is unwise to ignore

Tiny island with tiny population, but for some reason there's so many Maltese people in Australia
Apparently they like Australia so I guess it's an alright place
I'm Australian and don't understand why every other country doesn't have MANDATORY voting
If you want democratic process, then make EVERYONE participate
A referendum with 40% turnout isn't a referendum, it's an opinion poll
BREXIT is caused by rubbish like this
It's called a donkey vote or a protest vote
You show up to get your name marked off and leave the cards blank or draw dicks on it or write a short message etc
So was Brexit being a 52-48 split cause scores of people thought it was pointless to go out to vote for the status quo
The majority of Australians view voting as a civil responsibility, even if there are those who don't take it seriously
They said they were gonna leave Australia too if we passed some laws lmao
Please fucking go ahead Zucc
I mean, this is very admirable, but why is it more remarkable than any of the better video players that don't have ads
There's a long-running stream on YouTube that continuously plays lofi music that might suit studying or relaxing ([link here] The looped video, inspired by a film by Studio Ghibli, features a girl studying at her desk, hence she became known as "lofi girl".

You can have museums be a collection of items from around the world AND not do it via theft
Museums/galleries loan stuff out all the time, meaning the things travel the world and are in different museums all the time
So instead of filling a museum with stolen artefacts, you instead fill it with artefacts you purchase legitimately or have loaned/borrowed from their original owner with their permission
I've seen art galleries do this all the time
A returning of the English theft artefacts does in no way mean the museum ends up with only British stuff, it is a nonsense presupposition
This is not the result of returning the artefacts, nfi why it would even be considered

1: I think gold has always had value because it does not corrode, and thus has had all sorts of mystical claptrap associated with it
2: now I want to go and check out Undertale, which I suspect was your goal all along
2a: further, I suspect you wrote such a wall of text to filter out those without the intellectual stamina to cope with such a lengthy rant,  your comment being a sort of intelligence test, which leads me to conclude you are an Inhibitor Device, and I'm now frantically attempting to flee this galaxy before I'm eradicated

Important to note that this is just Minsk, Protests have been taking place in multiple towns and cities in Belarus all across the country today with pretty significant crowds emerging there as well
im starting to see people saying its at 200'000 with numbers rising, not sure if true but the crowd is definitely huge
Just like in some US cities they blocked off Black Lives Matter paint on the road
Plot twist: it's a summer photo
A free Belarus is good for all
Good luck over there

To get those speeds in Australia it can cost anywhere from $150-$600 a month
On 150 those are "theoretical maximums with an average evening speed of 250mbps
For 600, after paying hundreds if not thousands for a dedicated line to your home, you get a garunteed symmetrical 1000/1000 plan
I have access to those because they came with my unit
Fuck no I'm not spending a fuckton for it
I now only get 46mbps for $60/month
Telstra, NBN Co
and the LNP are keeping the country that invented WiFi in the past
LMFAO, crying in Australian
I pay around $70 for anything around 40 mbit
Well done dude :)

It's not though, they edited it after the post, multiple people have mentioned this
It's also a joke, they're not don't literally believe the US is a 3rd world country
Surprised you didn't catch that with all your wit
Also many of the students abroad will have been travelling not studying in the US, holidays exist
Do I?
Edit: I feel its not fair to only answer with two words and not address your question
I wouldn't see I have a "very large" number of comments critical about the US but I will admit I am critical of the US government
I think this is majorly because the US government to me represents probably one of the worst ways to run a first world country as powerful and full of potential as the US is
The people I like (for the most part, the arrogant US tourist stereotype can be accurate to some extent, but that goes with almost all stereotypes) but the government is absolutely shit in my opinion
Refresh the page, I edited my comment a couple minutes ago so you might not have seen it
I think I did answer it pretty well, my main issue is with the US government, not the people at all
I've never personally had a bad experience with the US but I've had friends who have, so it's not just things I've read online or whatever
Ive been very critical of New Zealand (a country I call home, despite being Australian) but conversation surrounding NZ governmemy isn't exactly something that comes up very frequently outside of NZ circles and I am in support of the large majority of the decisions made by the NZ governmemt, yet I can still be critical of the counties infrastructure
I don't know how far you scrolled through my comments but if you look at anything that isn't from this specific thread, it would take you a while to find this seemingly unless stream of anti-america posts that you say I have
Anti-communism at its finest
Russia lost tens upon tens of millions of people to the Nazi's. If the Nazi's didn't have to hold off the western front, back up the Italians, fend off Africa, they would have been steam rolled
The whole of Europe, besides Britain would have become the German empire
Including Russia, if not for Britain and it's allies
The Americans were only there because of Britain
The Australians, Kiwis, Canadians, and the rest of the commonwealth would not have been there without Britain
But how sweet would it be if everything was duodecimal and our number system was base 12

Because many Western countries have made it far too economically enticing for peoples from around the world to come
They have no reason to abandon their culture, because they did not move to these new countries for cultural reasons, they moved for economic ones
This is the repeated failure of these countries to enforce and champion their own values, and require that these people coming in assimilate and conform to the culture of the country they live in
For far too long it has been Western countries that have been conforming to the cultures of these people who have immigrated, rather than the other way around, which is complete insanity
I really don't think the problem is that the people with the news agenices are opposed to the idea of showing those cartoons
I think many of those people are terrified of what might happen to them if they show them, even if they won't ever actually admit that
The same reason you didn't march when someone opened fire on a mosque in New Zealand, all on live stream
He did it in the name of "western society", you must agree, no

I visited Finland once, I had flown from Brisbane ~35-38°C to Helsinki which was in a suspiciously warm December at ~0°C. Every shop or building I went into had the heat cranked up though, and it was too hot inside for me
I was taking off and putting on jackets and gloves and hats and scarves and all sorts of bullshit constantly
Yet all the locals just seemed perfectly comfortable inside or outside without all this clothing management

I really disliked the Churchill episode but one of my biggest gripes with modern content is how they whitewash things
It's so disrespectful to set something x years in the past and add a y character and have it all peachy
Blacks or gays or whatever is added, I hate to see a gay added and the main character JUST MAGICALLY HAPPENS to be one of the <1% of people who were okay with it during that time period
You see it most lately with African-Americans added to US tv shows or films
Once or twice is fine, but it's become a massive trend lately and I hate it
It's like they're so scared that if any of their protagonists are racists (which they probably would be given that time period) they would completely lose the audience, but I'd hope people were mostly smarter than that tbh
In The Crown, Charles is both very a sympathetic victim and also a giant douche, but we understand the complexities of the opposites to understand the character better

I think it's less about who the land mass where Hong Kong lies belongs to and more about the fact that the people of Hong Kong are happy as they are, being able to vote in their leaders and have a say in their politics
Being retaken by China means they lose their freedom of democracy and that's the reason for their protesting, not because they want to be owned by the British rather than the Chinese

This is dumb
The USSR never achieved socialism, as the state never handed power back to the workers
Communism is a stateless, classless, moneyless society in which the means of production are publicly owned by all
The Soviets never publicised the MoP, instead they promised continually that they would achieve communism soon (Like China does today despite having the 2nd highest amount of billionaires in the world)
They were also imperialist and Stalin was a racist cunt
The sources used are also very suspicious, the Black Book of Communism has a reputation for being terrible and PragerU is alt-right garbage
This seems like anti-communist propaganda written by right wing chuds
P.S. I'm not a tankie, I'm an anarchist
They killed anarchists first
PragerU is correct

I personally do not want to live under a communist government
However I also do not like the constant mischaracterisation of communism by so many people
Totalinarianism is what people are usually decrying when they talk about the horrors of communism
If you think that communism inevitably leads to totalinarianism that's fine (and even reasonable) but it's either dishonest or ignorant to proclaim them as the same thing
It's about the same rate in Australia for a specialist

what type of question is that
of course having less of your population whore themselves out is a good thing, what good comes from having girls being exploited for porn
Your know that multiple things can be true at the same time right
Porn is something that takes no skill, its literally trading your dignity for money which is why people look down on pornstars
At the same time because so few women want to participate in porn, women are exploited via human trafficking, drugs, debts, mental issues ect
which is why its also sad
yea no, "acting" in porn consists of degrading yourself and your body for money, its something any person can do and takes no skill
You are trading your dignity for money, which is why people look down on it
There is a reason why most pornstars are fucked up, whether that be because of exploitation, drugs, mental issues or some other problem in their life
Why are we here

I lived in Germany though (and travelled the Nordic pretty extensively) and I swear 10 degrees up there feels warmer than 10 degrees in Melbourne
I actually find the winter in Berlin more manageable than winter in Melbourne
Don’t come to coastal NSW then, unless you want to experience +25°C in humid heat
Nothing like going out for a walk in a singlet and coming back sunburnt as hell
*Australians cackling in the distance*
Exactly
If we had some decent walls, May to October would be much less painful  I'm spending my first winter here for 2 years before I move back to Germany in October and man
I'm not looking forward to it

He had slaves too, and had sex with his slaves
Maria the Copt was a concubine gifted to him (along with her sister) by the ruler of Egypt
She lived the rest of her life as a slave of Muhammad, and also gave birth to one of his children, which considering she was a slave, I can't see how that would not have been rape
I'm Australian & this looks fan-fucking-tastic
We went to the zoo today & although the temperature only got up 33c it still fucking sucked (it's been high 30s/low 40s all week and it's going back up pretty soon)

Seems pretty simple to me
Surely, as a German of all people, you are familiar with the concept of a false flag attack, [no]
about the su-57 - Russians haven't even introduced it to their airforce yet, hasn't seen any use as an air superiority fighter, and by most accounts it's largely undeveloped
Certainly on paper it seems like an extremely capable aircraft comparable to an f22, but then again India didn't purchase them as they believed it didn't meet performance expectations
So in this way there is not really a high degree of certainty that it would be able to flat out down 10 f-16's.

It sounds like you need electoral reform in the presidential elections
I'm not hugely familiar with the French system but it is two elections with no preferencing right
It seems like it could be reformed into a single election with instant run off or some other preferential system instead

I think a lot of Brits wouldn't have a clue about what you were referring to if mentioning 'Las Malvinas'.
Because they're called the Falklands
And, at the moment, anything to do with the EU would annoy everyone, no matter which way one voted, because it is simply going to dominate our lives until the day we're out
Hang on, no it won't. It will still annoy everyone because people will still blame the EU even when we are out
As a Brit (meaning I can speak English) the title is far more irritating than the Falklands quip
And for Australians
Clearly if there is a pretender to the throne outside Europe it should be us

Hey man, seriously don't stress about your English skills, if you are speaking English with a native speaker, it is their job to understand you regardless of how proficient you think you are
I would absolutely love if someone spoke to me in English to practice their speaking
But I completely understand how you feel because I tried my hand at learning Swedish and I'm shit at it :P
My knowledge of swedish is basically: I think I could do pretty well introducing myself with casual formalities but generally any question beyond "varifrån kommer du” and "hur mår du" I'll struggle with
If you have any questions about English grammar or other rules I'll be happy to help you :) unfortunately I don't know enough swedish to ask about anything in particular
It's just the whole "ett" and "en" thing that annoys me greatly
It isn't like "a" and "an" in English that have specific rules :(
I mean didn't China already kind of do that with Tibet
Also note that there will be some value-added benefits of this:
* Large amounts of wind turbines could be located along the dam wall, generating energy
* The dam walls would be able to carry an electrical grid, spreading out electricity availability
* The dam walls would also be able to carry water pipes, and thus fresh water could be piped around Europe where needed
* Desalination plants can be built along the western sections of the wall, powered by the wind turbines above, and providing fresh water if lack of rainfall is an issue
* The dam walls would also have a railway, allowing freight and passenger traffic along them
As well as a highway
* The eastern side of the dam walls can also have port facilities located there, allowing freight to be imported/exported via the rail system
* Fish farms on both sides of the wall can be built to both provide a seafood industry, as well as to replenish the stocks of wild fish which are very low at the moment
* Housing can be located on the dam wall, opening up the wall to be a population centre as well, especially for those who work on the wall in the ongoing industries mentioned above
also all the WW1/2 wrecks too

The Russians made the Buran orbiters to be their version of the shuttle, and in most ways the Buran was actually better than the American orbiter
It wasn't that they made them for shits and giggles though, the program was just getting to the end of the testing phase when the Soviet Union started to collapse and the money for the space program dried up for a while
The Buran orbiters were stuck into hangars and left there so they could be pulled out later if they were needed, but the hangars were poorly maintained and the roof started leaking, and when they sent a crew up to do repairs the whole roof collapsed destroying both orbiters and killing some of the workers

I worked in a cafe with shit air-con (in summer it was hotter inside even on days that were over 40), our uniform had a beret
We used to wet them and wear them, it kept us heaps cooler

Once it gets about 40 we stop and have a water / ice cream break once an hour (work pays for it no problems) around 45 we stop work completely

According to Americans, government investing money in education/healthcare/infrastructure = socialism
What bullshit, Christopher Columbus discovery was far more important, it permanently established communication between the Americas and Europe and started the mass colonization that would occur
Saying Christopher Columbus committed genocide is ridiculous, while he did spread the diseases that would end up killing more then 90% of the American population its not like he knew it would happen, it was completely accidental and would have inevitably occurred whenever the Americas finally established contact with the rest of the world
People always give him shit over initially thinking he was in India (btw when he says India he means the indies, so he thought was in Indonesia or somewhere near it), it was a perfectly reasonable conclusion to make given the circumstances and he did eventually realize he was in a new land (though he thought it southeast-ish of Asia)
i am not sure what you mean by begging
do you mean when he was asking for funding
because that's an odd name for it
Fact is that Christopher Columbus gets way too much shit and is someone people use as a target, its almost like real life is complicated
This is fake news
I am going to post what i said in another comment
From ["Letter of Columbus to the Nurse of Prince John"] page 378
>"A hundred castellanos are as easily obtained for a woman as for a farm, and it is very general, and there are plenty of dealers who go about looking for girls; those from nine to ten are now in demand, and for all ages a good price must be paid
>"I assert that the violence of the calamity of turbulent persons has injured me more than my services have profited me; which is a bad example for the future
>I take it my oath that a number of men have gone to the Indies who did not deserve water in the sight of God and of all the world; and now they are returning thither, and leave is granted them
He speaks against the slavery of young girls and punished those who committed these acts with mutilation and death
>Bobadilla was immediately met with complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolomeo, and Diego
Bobadilla reported to Spain that Columbus regularly used torture and mutilation to govern Hispaniola
>Because of their gross misgovernance, Columbus and his brothers were arrested and imprisoned upon their return to Spain from the third voyage
The gross misgovernace was because Columbus had failed to extract enough gold and because of complaints of fellow Spaniards
They were complaining about the mutilation of there fellow colonists
The natives were also mutilated for various crimes but they didn't care about them, the tyranny they were talking about was his treatment of his fellow Spaniards
I don't deny that Columbus brutally mutilated and killed many people, both native and Spaniard alike
I do however deny the notion that he was anymore brutal than other Spaniards, many of who complained about his defense of natives rights
Consider that future governors were the ones responsible for the elimination of the natives
42 years of governors after Columbus brought the native population down from 200,000 to 201 (of course around 90% of these people would have died from disease but that still leaves 20,000)
Holy shit lol I remember chilling in front of this building from this company and they sent out security because they thought I was being suspicious
I always thought that was so weird and it just hit me what company it was, I thought it was just some typical business but it was their R&D

Maybe it's different in Britain so I shouldn't have spoke so soon
Aussie here, why do you think we're notorious for constantly changing PM's?
Our government having a weak PM seems like the exception, not the rule

Giovanni Gentile Probably had a bigger role doctrinally
But Mussolini carried it through to power
This is based on what I was taught and what I saw whilst doing volunteer work for a charity called "Save the Children" in Kununurra, Western Australia
This is an example of the cycle of poverty among Aboriginal communities in Australia that began with the "Stolen Generation", they were the Aboriginal children who were stolen from their families to be brought up in "missions" where they were taught essentially how to be like white people
It was awful, and it caused problems that are still faced today in Aboriginal communities such as depression
The depression leads to alcoholism, the alcoholism leads to crime and so on
You are a young Aboriginal boy, around 9 or 10, who lives in a tiny town in Western Australia, out in the desert
You live in a crumbling, trashed home with your alcoholic mother and your father is in jail
Due to your mother's alcoholism, home isn't safe, and you have been suspended from school
It's not like you were learning anything there anyway because you always got in trouble
Instead of school or home, you decide to go play with your mates like you have done for weeks now, still wearing the same clothes as last week, unwashed
Your mates have found something fun to do today, it's called stealing
This is your first encounter with the police, the first of many
A couple years later, you end up in juvenile prison, it's an awful place, you are treated horribly
You are released from juvenile prison, and not long after you end up there again
Between your sentences, you've grown up, found a lovely girlfriend, but all those years of missing out on school meant you have no education and therefore no job
All your money comes from Centrelink, a government service that provides money to those who need it
Your girlfriend gives birth to a son, but it's difficult to raise a child when you have little to no money, much of it spent on you and your girlfriends alcohol addiction which you got after trying "just a little bit" with your mates when you were just young teens
In order to survive, you steal again, and get caught again
You are sent to prison with your alcoholic girlfriend at home with your son
Your son is an Aboriginal boy, around 9 or 10, who lives in a tiny town in Western Australia, out in the desert
Save the Children is a charity that runs centres in towns with high poverty rates in Australia, they give children a safe place to play and be educated
The kids I worked with were just like any other, great kids, and it's awful that they have to live like they do
I hope that the children of the children I worked with will grow up in a new Australia where charities like "Save The Children" won't have to exist

Be proud of your accents
It’s a super endearing part of who you are
If I hear a non-native accent it just makes me wanna talk to you more
Native speakers who struggle to understand a foreign accent usually have never travelled, or have poor listening skills
We make fun of every accent
I personally dislike my own accent
It is far too American for my liking
At least you don’t get congratulated on speaking your native language like me and a couple of my mates have been lmao
English natives don't care because we all have accents
Whereas it is a generic Mid west American Accent or something funky like the Jamaican Accent, we are all used to natives speaking English differently
So when it comes to non natives, we like to hear the accent but also we need to be able to understand you though lmao
Eh I lived in Italy for a year,  I actually reckon that Northern Italians have have different accent
Rather than sounding like Mario they’re accent seemed to have more bass
Dunno how to describe it but yeah there is definitely a regional difference
On another note I had a lot of trouble understanding the Sicilian accent when I was learning Italiano
What I mean is that it sounds like you guys use the back of you throat and seem to have your tongue lower when you start a sentence
Although maybe it just the Genovese that are weird lmao
It’s been so long since I’ve last been in Italy

I watched the Dutch YouTuber NikkieTutorials for an embarrassingly long time before I realised she was not actually American
The younger generation seem to be very good at masking their accent
and I assume the German accent played a hand in the formation of the American accent

I enjoyed Naples, probably because I was expecting the worst but was pleasantly surprised by the decayed charm of the place
And I still dream of the pizza there

I've around the UK a bit, and for some reason Leeds stood out as a dump more than others
"Is that so
Let me just check the database
no, it seems service 1F43 was within 1 minute of schedule
We would be the guy from another office that nobody really knows but shows up at parties anyway
Britain is probably the guy who’s threatened to quit 3 years ago and is standing by the door trying to renegotiate their exit terms while everyone else is staring at them waiting for them to sign the document
Poland would be the hot receptionist that everybody in the office wants
The Balkans are the people who always argue in the break room

My "regions" are bigger than the average
Same in Australia- I'm living in Germany, and I can't quite wrap my head around the "du" and "Sie" usage - I understand it in a theoretical way, I just can't seem to put it into practice
And to think that by Australian standards, Americans are quite formal with all that sorta stuff
You'd lose your sh*t here
It's very rare to call someone anything other than their first name, even children call adults by first name (unless it's a teacher)
Yeah, that's very normal here
The level of formality of some countries is kinda weird/uncomfortable for us
I find it very old fashioned, but at the same time I respect other cultures' customs
I've heard Germany in particular is quite formal with the titles/names thing

The numerous disasters that have occurred in the past 3 months are not a result of climate change/Climate change isn't real/Climate Change isn't a man made disaster and there is no way to stop it
Same here
The devastating fires we had, followed immediately by the torrential floods
A false flag operation started by the Greens (environmentalist party) to make it look like climate change was real
Or simply hand waved away because “Australia’s always been like this
Nothing new
There have been some half hearted threats of it, but there are too many protesters for one thing, and it’s not going to achieve Jack shit for another
"Hello There" - English

Is there a rule for which adjectives go where
I was already an adult when I learnt that our adjectives went in a certain order in English
Lol no it's not
I find the Dutch/German structure truely bizarre
But cool at the same time
This is how English was written 500 years ago
Sounds to me like Shakespeare
Dutch and German have weird sentence structures (for English-speakers)
English and French sentence structures are almost identical
Tinnie/Tinny is also a small boat haha
What
They're talking about French
They mentioned in their comment that some adjectives come before
I've noticed it in words like "bon" and "petite" and thought they might know why
It is certainly interesting
I'm not sure if English would have been mutually intelligible with Dutch or German, even if it wasn't influenced by French
Languages that developed on islands usually suffered the 'island effect', but who knows (just look at how different Icelandic is vs the other Scandinavian languages)
I like the German and Dutch languages, but I think I still prefer the (modern) English word order and structure (sorry
But that's probably just because that's what I'm used to
It just sounds so 'old timey' to me
And saying Shakespeare was Dutch is still a hangable offence in the UK ;)
I do wonder if over time, Dutch and German will start to more resemble English in this regard though
Jesus Christ where do I begin with Scomo
Scott Morrison is Australia's current prime Minister, he was voted in by all the boomers who's only response to criticism is "Lay off Scomo
He's doing the best he can
Let's go back and have a look at his stupidity:
During the Australian bushfire crisis a few months back, Scott Morrison did these things:
- Cut the budget of the Rural Fire Service by $50000 AUD
- Sold a shit ton of water to shady Chinese companies in the middle of drought season
- Visited a couple of fire affected towns so he would look good in the media which absolutely fucking backfired because he was shockingly rude to people and physically forced a woman to shake his hand when she refused his offer to
- And last but certainly not least: ***TOOK A FUCKING HOLIDAY TO HAWAII IN THE MIDDLE OF A NATIONAL EMERGENCY***
Thankfully he hasn't repeated much of this bullshit with the new national emergency, but he did attempt to delay the shutting down of schools and etc but was forced to anyway
I think people understand that the little classrooms you see in the ads aren't private schools in the suburbs
A lot of the poverty these charities aim to help with is rural
They want to put wells in villages that don't have reliable clean water, offer food to subsistence farmers affected by drought, distribute vaccines to communities that don't have reliable access to health care
Yes the life of middle and even urban working class people isn't depicted by charities
It's a pity we don't get to see what life looks like for so many people and we should make an effort to seek out their stories
But even in developing economies full of opportunity let's not pretend everything is fine
Botswana is doing great economically but has a massive HIV crisis and a poverty rate around 10%.
In my industry it's amazing the difference between farms in Columbia and in Ethiopia, for example
One is hundreds of acres of carefully groomed and pruned trees and educated farmers who understand the global market and may even process their own product in cooperation with international distributors or even the end client on a different continent, the other is about 5 acres of untouched trees, you pick the product, take it to market and get the price of the day
The level of education and power available to a farmer varies wildly
It's mostly Asian kids here in Australia, but there's normally at least one token shot of some smiling African kids in front of some running water

There is a Dutch ice cream chain called Australian ice cream
I think they make chocolate too
Not Australian
I always thought tiramisu was Japanese, just because it sounds so much like a Japanese word
There's a small chain of premium ice cream stores in Australia called "Royal Copenhagen", I don't know why they're called that but it's some of the best ice cream I've ever had
Another Danish ice cream association
Nah there's none in Victoria, which is a shame
Most of their locations as far as I remember are Queensland, NSW and South Australia
In Sydney there's one right in Circular Quay and another not too far away

Until this very moment, I had always thought 'avocado' was a Spanish word lol
Edit: just found out it comes from Nahuatl ahuacatl, which was then aguacate in Spanish
English borrowed the word from Spanish, but changed the sound and spelling of the word
even in the netherlands
So how did people say that before English
Seems a weird thing to not have in a language
Ah, gotcha
In many languages, the official name for the country is some form of 'Holland'.
Stand in the bicycle lanes
It's normal in many countries
You'll hear both forms here, although I feel like The Netherlands is starting to become more common now
If they're tight enough, your voice can sing a few octaves higher
Great answer
People everywhere are just different
Doesn't mean they're rude
It wouldn't happen here either
That would be considered being rude to the customer, which is a no no (unless provoked of course)
Super interested how they do fines for Non EU Tourists

Australian here
I remember when I moved to Norway and started saying G’day to people on the bus and at the gym
They were horrified and I think I caused some people to have a heart attack from the anxiety of it all
Isn't this to do with the Iberian peninsula's time zone offset from the solar day though
Moved from the uk, with its official limit of 112 km/h and effective limit of 135 km/h, to Australia where speed hysteria never really evolved into the more nuanced road policing approach, 100 km/h limit on motorways except for some glorious sections of 110 km/h, and god help you if you're more than 10 km/h over the limit
It's insane, as the quality of driving is really poor despite this, but the connection hasn't been made by those in power yet
I like [these bus ones]
Merry Christmas from Kangaroo land
Don't know if other English speaking countries use this but in Australia, a "Dutch Oven" is when you fart under a blanket or in a sleeping bag and trap the smell in there
>We do still sometimes use French kiss for a kiss with tongues but it's rare
In Australia I think 'french kissing' would be the most common term
'toung kissing' sounds revolting to me tbh
Unsure, I've always used it for just trapping it
Haha, I see, well I guess Google has proven that I'm incorrect
Never been evil enough to try a real Dutch oven though
Thankyou for this insight
Oh I see, I assume that must have been a traumatic experience
You can add a second flag to your flair by going into the user flair menu on the front page of the subreddit and clicking Edit flair in the top right corner (assuming you're on mobile) you'll then be able to make a custom flair, for example:

Assuming AU gives you the Australian flag and not the Austrian one, in which case it might be AS
You'll end up being a shelf stocker at a supermarket
Australia has its own policy when it comes to foreigners
I'm not supposed to tell you all this but here it goes:
When a foreigner asks something dumb, for example "Do you guys ride kangaroos to school
" ALWAYS go along with it, our favourite past time is feeding tourists bullshit
I'm sure many of you have seen the video of the Scottish reporter who was convinced she was holding a "drop bear".
I think it's a council regarding the French language
They decide if a new word is worthy of being added to the dictionary
Essentially the gatekeepers of French
Most probably yes, sharpen the tip of the hat and it will impale the drop bear when it drops into your head from the trees

As an Australian, reading this thread is quite amusing and highlights the difference in climates and housing design
Thinking back to when I was in Paris on a 30 degree day, it did feel like a 35+ day in Sydney
40 degrees is not uncommon even in Melbourne (which is one of the furthest Australian cities from the equator)
It’s so cute when the UK has a little ‘heatwave’ and y’all dying and it’s like 28 degrees
> nearly 40C
Hahah, I wish we had the European definition of a heatwave
Don’t you guys have fly screens
New Caledonia is a fantastic example

They need to do what the Belgians did with their anthem - a version of lyrics in each of the three languages, plus a combined one that can be sung in major events:
>O dierbaar België, O heilig land der Vaad'ren,
Onze ziel en ons hart zijn u gewijd
>À toi notre sang, ô Patrie !
Nous le jurons tous, tu vivras !
>So blühe froh in voller Schöne,
zu der die Freiheit Dich erzog,
> Und fortan singen Deine Söhne:
Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté !
>Het woord getrouw, dat g' onbevreesd moogt spreken,
Voor Vorst, voor Vrijheid en voor Recht
Gesetz und König und die Freiheit hoch
Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté !
Yes I’ve heard that quite a few times while watching the rugby, it’s great
Saw the WC final in a pub in Ghent that was full of saffers, was pretty impressive to hear
Rugby countries often have fantastic anthems, particularly SA, Scotland, France and the king of them all, NZ
Pretty embarrassing to hear our uninspiring little thing when the wallabies are playing — but it could be worse, we could be Irish
"We have one, don't know what it says , but if we encounter a problem well take a look at it"
-Jim Jefferies
"WHEREAS the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and under the Constitution hereby established:"
This was written in 1900, and the states listed there do not include the Australian Capital Territory or Northern Territory because they are not classified as states (also back then NT didn't exist, instead there was Central Australia)
Australia is still a constitutional monarchy unfortunately
Also, I'm not to sure if this is the first "article" as such because the [constitutions website] doesn't list them as articles
If that isn't the article you were looking for then this certainly is:
"This Act may be cited as the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act
My partner & I stayed at an Airbnb in Barcelona, sharing the house with the owner
In the morning, I went to the kitchen which was right next to the master bedroom where the owners were sleeping
They left the bedroom door open and I could see them both lying in the bed with their shirts off staring at me
They were a gay couple
Was funny

When people think of Australian history they think of Gallipoli or Ned Kelly
An event we're all taught about in school is the Eureka revolution
During the Victorian gold rush a bunch of miner were pissed that they needed a license to mine so they built a fort, made their own flag and basically told the British government to fuck off
Then they all got shot and nothing much else really happened and now the flag is used by right wing fascist polotical parties despite the Eureka Stockade being a left wing movement
Oh yeah that to

Not in a financial sense but if you go to Australia expecting to see wild deadly animals, you won't. You may see some, but they are rare, you'll definitely see some pretty birds and kangaroos but if you want to see anything else, go to a zoo

I went to Kaunas once backpacking and hitchhiking with a friend
When we arrived we were lost and couldn't find our way or contact who we needed to
We stopped a guy on the street who spoke in a tone that sounded like we ruined his day, but went the extra mile in helping us get where we needed to go, and even checked up on us later to make sure everything was alright
An act of kindness like that goes a long way to making positive memories in a place and I have good memories in Lithuania
I actually went there my second time in Dublin
I was expecting it to be awful but it was actually alright
They just take you through atmospheric themed rooms while speaking about Irish mythology and legend
Not a mind blowing experience, but fun
They also make sure people understand it isn't a typical museum set up before they pay
Peleş is wonderful

The telegondola Sinaia was also something I'll never forget

I started buying it here in Australia as well since I came back
Only one brand (Ski Queen) though and an organic food store in my city
Better than nothing though
Nothing better than brunost with strawberry jam on toast

New Zealand used to be part of Australia at one point
So did Papua New Guinea but we don't have banter with them
Was Germany’s claim on Alsace-Lorraine removed after WW2, or does Germany still claim its former lands like Eastern Pomerania and Silesia
Germany can't even expand anywhere
Remember when they tried going through Belgium or Poland
So, Germany has no claims legally
Nah, France would want its former glory returned
Does Germany have any claims or have they been claimless
I guess I play too much HOI4 or EU4
Australian media hasn't covered much, if at all (Fuck you Murdoch) The only reason I know it's even happening is because Google keeps recommending me articles about it because I did a bunch of research about the country for an English project and now thinks I'm some sort of Belarus enthusiast
Kind of an off topic question but does Rupert Murdoch control most of the big media companies in New Zealand like he does in Australia
I see, fair enough
Definitely much better than Murdoch
Tipping
Why am I obligated to pay 20% of the meal cost to the server

Perth, it's the second most isolated city in the world (1st is Hawaii), and the 1st most isolated on land
Lovely city
I was only there for one night last week, but I'd happily go back to explore more
I went to Olsztyn and really enjoyed it
Close to nature and the big lake, the castle where Copernicus worked etc
Nice part of the country imo
I also thought Katowice had a bit of rugged charm and thought the Silesian museum there was fantastic
Germany or France
ditto
Was in a lift with two ladies from former Yugoslavia speaking in their own language, didn't think much of it as that's pretty normal in Australia
Lots of immigrants and visitors from all over the world
As we were getting out of the lift my boyfriend turned to me and loudly explained what they were saying about me
All compliments, luckily
They were surprised that someone so tall could still be so cute (in their language cute very much is associated with little, apparently)
Now I know about 2 words of Serbo-Croatian
It doesn't often come in handy
Was with my boyfriend in Austria and received some not very nice words
Jokes on them, I know German, and smiled st them and kissed my boyfriend to piss them off
lol that's brilliant
I'm not still with that guy thank goodness, but one always stumbles across people who speak the language and now I know one phrase
Hello mate
Australian here in Norway
Don’t take Melbourne for granted
To be honest, 13-17c daily maximums in winter sounds pretty awesome once you’ve lived in the north of Europe for five years
It’s Spring here now in Oslo and although we’ve had some nice weather, the average day is around 10-11c and it’s cloudy as hell
I had summers in Denmark where the weather topped out at 17
Sure, the days are long but unless you want to layer up, it’s still not much fun outside unless there’s a real heat wave because the nights are almost always cold
And then winter comes
Sun comes up at 10am and goes down again at 3pm
By comparison, Melbourne climate is terrific
8-9 months of beach weather
I would be down swimming at Brighton beach from late September, early October, right up until May
Just try and get yourself a Europe holiday every July and August and then you enjoy the best of both worlds
But yeah, go to central or south of Europe if you want to have the guarantee of nice weather
Canberran here, just checking in to sympathise deeply
Winter makes me deeply miserable
I’m going to look at the advice some of the people in this thread have provided about summer-lamps and what not
I mean there’s only so often I can rug up with a cup of hot milo and tell myself “well isn’t this fucking comfy” while trying not to cry lol
Also its been 20 degrees celsius all week and I’m getting around in a t shirt
It’s perfect autumn weather
Sun’s out, Guinness out
It’s the extremes of temperature in Melbourne that mean you don’t often feel comfortable
Summer days over 40 and winter days around 12 but with an icy wind
The shoulder seasons really are the best
And there are spiders and snakes everywhere
Everything wants to kill you in Australia - weather, flora, and fauna
Late but not that many people smoke and there's definitely a stigma against it
There's also a lot of places you can't smoke like in basically all public buildings like shops, pubs, restaurants, government buildings; there's  huge stigma against smoking in the house especially if you rent and outside most buildings you have to be a certain distance from the door to smoke
Good rule of thumb is you can only smoke outdoors
Worth noting that the lower income people are more likely to smoke and tradies (tradespeople like builders, electricians etc)
Current daily smoking rate is:
*  Males: 18+ 12
8% 14+ 12
* Females: 18+ 10
4% 14+ 9
Ex smoking rate:
*  Males: 18+ 26
*  Females: 18+  21
Never smoked:
*  Males:  18+ 56
7% 14+ 59%
* Females: 18+ 65
4% 14+  67
How much are they raising the prices by
I was living in Denmark around 2 years ago (from Australia) and was shocked at how cheap cigarettes could be compared to Australia where 1 packet is around AUD$35 or about 160DKK
Yeah they're taxed to high heavens in a bid to discourage smoking
I'm indifferent to it because smoking is disgusting
My only vague concern is that it's mostly those with less income who smoke so it's a poor tax on cancer sticks
Pretty sure it's higher than that, the more popular brands are around $35-ish
I don't smoke though so I couldn't give you exact prices
Yeah I thought I remembered it being around the 50 kr mark
Good that they’re starting to increase it though, I was so shocked at how many people smoked when I lived there
>Even the Amish buy Dutch horses
But isn't that because the Amish are Dutch originally
Or is that just a name
You guys aren't falling for that again hey
Doesn't it have the most pubs per capita in Scotland as well
That blew me away when I had chemo was how much medical equipment had "Made in Ireland" on it
Spices don't always come from places you colonise
What did we give you
I see, odd to call them Dutch then
That's not a spice
Yeah right
Pronunciation eh
Can I just add from another side of the world here; googling (or facebooking you, whatever) I can understand but to be so direct about it in conversation, and on passing with others present especially on a topic like you’ve mentioned is quite the faux pas
That’s not being “honest” or “blunt”, that’s just rude
I spent my time in Germany amongst other foreign lands and I know exactly how you would have felt
I’ve been in those situations myself
For me, I took issue with the ones who chose not to see anything wrong with what they had just done and didn’t bother to at least understand why other cultures might take offence
They insisted they could do no wrong
what in fuck
pretty sure welsh speakers, breton speakers or gaellic speakers can read this but i sure fucking cant
If you learn German old english is easier, but aside from a few words it’s pretty much incomprehensible to me
Another way I would look at it , is that it would be very hard for a French speaker to understand Classical Latin, even though they’re both romance
I would imagine an Italian would have an easier time of it
It wasn’t too bad, just weird wording
What are the most horrible atrocities your country committed in their history
(Shut up Germany, we get it, bad man with moustache)
Australia had what's now called the stolen generation
The government used to kidnap aboriginal children from their families and take them to "missions" where they would be taught how to live and act as white people did in an attempt to assimilate them into European society
Moreover, Assimilation policy also sought to breed out aboriginal people through Biologically integrating them into White society- ethnic cleansing is the epitome of evil shit
Wow that's really interesting thank you so much for sharing
Not really, I know about Stalin's purges and another Russian person commented about "Russification" under Tsarist rule so if there's anything else other than that I would enjoy hearing it
Wow that's insane thank you for sharing
That's really interesting, thank you for sharing
Wow I hadn't heard of this until now that's really interesting thanks
In Australia the kids were taken if it was suspected that one of the parents were white
Was it the same in Canada
I understand entirely, thank you for sharing
Mustache man Austrian, mustache man rule Germany instead of Austria, Austria not blamed for mustache man
Thank you so much that's really interesting
Which country is this
In Australia, the children were forbidden to learn their own language, and each aboriginal "nation" (They dislike the term tribe) had their own language and many of them went extinct so there are no records of the language
I did service work in a town next to the border of Western Australia and the Northern Territory called Kununurra
It's a small town with a population of a few thousand with a high percentage of them being of aboriginal descent
There are less than 20 people in the town who speak the original language of their nation
Romania I'm guessing
Understood
A few other Germans commented that too, apparently your other bad moustache man, Wilhelm, attempted a genocide on the African population am I correct
Wow that's really interesting thank you so much for sharing
Yeah so I learnt from some of the other Germans that commented here
It's kind of interesting how we generally only look at the one section of history we are most familiar with and are surprised when we find out that other things happened during that time as well
It's 12:20 am and I pissed myself laughing
Oh my that's a very long list
Ah yes but mustache man make Germany do big bad bad and Austria did little bad bad so Germany blamed for big bad bad
A lot of them (Not all) ignore other countries history in favour of rewriting history books to make America look better
"We are the only reason the allies won world war one and two" and etc
Thank you both for sharing, this is her interesting and I do like to see both sides of an argument
Correct but what I'm trying to tell you is that although Austria is responsible for mustache man, the world leaders did not recognise it as such
But at the same time you created us
Theres
a lot in there
How did they get the girls from simply irresistable

Scott Morrison, our current prime minister, he basically did everything he could to ignore (or undermine) the bushfire crisis we had in January and February
This included but not limited to:
- Flying to Hawaii on a holiday for 2 weeks the second the crisis began, only came back after backlash from the entire planet
- Cut funding to fire services
- Selling our water to China in the middle of drought and fire season
- Undermining climate change policies (which he has been doing for years) despite the overwhelming evidence pointing towards CC being the main reason the bushfires were so bad this year
- Attempted to pass a stupid bill that NOBODY asked for, and would have backfired entirely if passed (Religious discrimination bill)
- Instead if using our taxpayer money to fund firefighting, granted it sporting centres for 0 fucking reason
Also, most of that money went to sport centres that the minister who proposed it participated at
The only person I could think of that would be hated as much as Scomo would be Martin Bryant who slaughtered 35 innocent people in cold blood in 1996
It was the last mass shooting in Australian history
Haig's also pretty hated by those who know of him in Australia, because there were plenty of Australians who died under his command
For some reason there's a park in my city called Haig Park that still hasn't been renamed
That doesn't really distinguish them
He's regarded quite well for his actions within Belgium
Yeah, I do think so
What gives you that impression
There are plenty who admire him
Yep pretty much
Britain for fish and chips
Oh, and Poland: We own Pavlova, not you
Yay for the Aussie mention
Much love big Zeus
We take great care of your big Greek expat family over here in Sydney & Melbourne
They did create you along with Prussia but I don't understand why you weren't called Flanders-Wallonia
Well if it involves trump, some idiots being Floridians or a natural disaster, a school shooting or people not doing the wrong thing, then yes, it is often
America is just a parody of what it used to be
(Not European obviously)
But if you visit sacred Aboriginal sites like Uluru and don't bother learning about it's significance and just pose for photos and say "haha big rock" you need to grow a fucking spine because shit like that is boring without learning about it's history and significance in the world's oldest living culture
Also, Canberra is overrated, correct, no tourists go to Canberra and nobody likes Canberra, everybody hates it, but it's still overrated because it's way more shit than people think
Parris that's all i hear when people come back home
Also- anything sound of music based in Salzburg
even my mum who loves the movie to bits says she preferred  the fortress to the SoM stuff
Oh well
Now I can watch the movie and say I’ve been there
Where would you recommend instead
Tbh I didn't learn about Aboriginal culture through websites or books, I got most of my knowledge first hand when travelling through the Northern Territory and Western Australia (especially in Arnemland) So I don't have any recommendations for you
But I will be able to answer some questions that you might have
I went to Apeldoorn once
How can anyone even have a strong opinion on that place
It's just a town with a cool palace
At least it's not offensively shit, like Rotterdam
I do in fact
- There are over 500 Aboriginal nations (They don't like being called tribes) each with their own unique language, stories and teachings
- There is no evidence to support Aboriginal nations conflicting with each other
They survived over 60000 years without war
- The Aboriginal people or "first nation" people have been around so long that there are cave paintings of animals that have long been extinct (When I visited Arnhem Land I saw one of an extinct species of giant bird that died out 30000 years ago)
- Each nation has their own stories but some are shared by other nations and they differ slightly, most of the stories you'll find online are either a combination of these differing stories or a version of it from a more well known nation
- Most Aboriginal "dream time" stories involve the rainbow serpent, a kind of Aboriginal deity which as the name suggests, is a rainbow snake
I might add more to this later, I'll put new edits here:
That's fair
In my half a year in NL I always found Dutch people to be super chill
Cafes are very often bars in the Netherlands
It is hard to believe but some evidence even suggests that Aboriginal people have been in Australia for more than 80000 years
60000 is the widely accepted length of time
That's really sad, it's by far the most interesting place I've ever been to
Bloody kiwi's
Hawaii
If I want to go to a pacific island, there’s plenty to choose from that haven’t been americanized and turned into a tourist factory
Oi, they're a good defence mechanism
>Many Millennials don’t drink alcohol anymore
Huh, another cultural difference I learned cuz of here In Aus, we have a massive binge drinking culture and epidemic in young people (16-26y.o)
I always thought Europe was the same
Australians will arrive anywhere in thongs (flip flops)
Sometimes you've just got to walk a little bit faster
Of course Australians arrive to Finland in flip flops
Are you going to dress for the 10 minutes it might take to get a taxi to the airport or for the 10 hours on a plane
*Les Misérables* is a story of some slightly sad and annoyed French people
Australia here and went to France for a few weeks
I am still surprised on how much stuff can happen in an area that is the size of my sub-district in my state
Like the Western front was as far away from Berlin to my house to Sydney
I always imagined it to be sooo far
And don’t get me started when people would fly to Paris and not endure that day drive
Youse guys don’t understand how good you have it
I'm an Australian who now lives in Europe
I just spent a month back home in country Victoria, and the one thing I got sick of was having to drive everywhere
And an hour would take me to the closest same sized town without traffic
And an hour in Europe is another country
Unless your work involves some kind of toxic or noisy process
If I worked at a metal smelter or an airport, I'd rather live a little further away for my quality of life
If you can make it within sunlight hours, it’s reasonable
But sometimes you have to make an overnight stop in a small country town with its only attraction is a ‘big thing’
Then it’s long
It takes me 1 hour 30 minutes to get to work
well in australia, I think we consumse most alcohol per capita in the world (off the top of my head)
Drinking a lot is just standard here
Yeah we have a bit of a drinking culture problem
"hey you *pause* yeah you *pause* get yer lawn mower *pause"* off my son" is one of the first things i heard when i visited belfast
I could never imagine a guy calling another guy 'love' without them being gay
No judgement, just seems a bit weird
Windshield phenomenon
Australia has so many issues with masculinity
The whole men must be men thing is out of control
I'm gay, and I still think it would be weird
Not weird in being bad, but in being 'odd'.
There's issues in Australia for sure, but I wouldn't say it's 'out of control'.
>A follow-up study by Kent Wildlife Trust in 2019 used the same methodology as the RSPB survey and resulted in 50% fewer impacts
The research also found that modern cars, with a more aerodynamic body shape, killed more insects than boxier vintage cars up to 70 years old
[13]
The study found that modern cars *killed more* insects
Scots definitely, I know barely anyone speaks it but it’s very similar to English
Beer, i don't drink myself but thats not going anywhere
Oh where do I start
I'll just say the one no one else has
Fairy Bread, it's bread with butter and hundreds of thousands over it
very nice
The world can thank Australia for the glorious invention of the [Chiko Roll]  You may not like it but this is what peak culinary delicacy looks like
A sausage wrapped up in a slice of white bread, with tomato sauce and onions
Having one at a polling place on election day is so iconic that we call it a ‘democracy sausage’. They can otherwise be found at Bunnings (hardware store) on the weekend or at any standard school fête/barbecue/outdoor event
Bunnings snags
McDonalds is the most popular here but we call it Macca's instead, but if your talking about exclusive restaurants then I would say Oporto, which I believe exists only in Australia and Singapore
It's my favourite fast food tbh
I usually hate ham and cheese sandwiches, but ham and cheese baguettes were like crack cocaine to me in France
The French make everything taste good
I'd say Italy probably has exported the most cultural dishes than anyone that are still considered as a cultural dish
Some of the others here I'm like "Oh, that's from *X*" but Italian food is Italian food
Australia: Whitlam giving sand to an Aboriginal elder
What about the broken wall that had a chunk knocked out
Or the united Germans on Brandenburg gate
In New Jersey we have created the widely recognized metric of how many fucks we chose to give in a certain moment
That's what I thought too
There's not much in Europe like Wieliczka
It was also iirc on the first ever round of UNESCO world heritage sites, so it's on the radar, too
I think Australia will soon follow
Haha my German friend showed me that in school
I never knew it was just a German meme ^_^
New Zealand, maybe America but they are more like cousins or the neighbours kid
Sorry Britain, the Jack's gotta go
I would definitely use the Eureka stockade flag instead ***IF*** it hadn't been hijacked by nationalists who use it as a symbol of Australian Fascism
The Eureka stockade was about workers rights and freedom from colonial oppression, not fascism
the folks at r/vexillology would have a fit over the complexity of the crown part lol
Flip it upside down so people get confused between Poland and Indonesia like they do with Chad and Romania
That sounds like they want him to fly the nest, tbh
“A 2010 Chinese thriller film Kill Octopus Paul depicts Paul's predictions as being part of an international match-fixing scheme
Excuse me but that actually sounds like a good film lmao
I really like German
It has that same "aggressive " tone as Arabic
I'm trying too learn it
The other germanic languages had those sounds at some point
It's definitely Germanic
Thanks Germany for all the funny comments on this subreddit
And thank you Scotland for all the funny tweets
Mainly Italy for inventing nutella
This is both amazing and so sad
Imagine being a Polish soldier, liberating the Netherlands and being so close to Poland, yet never being allowed to return under risk of being jailed or worse
I can’t stop imagining WW2 in this comment
I always lock as I live in a big city
It's pretty safe but I prefer to lock it
john went to the servo though the forest exept hes a pov cunt
It does for Australian, NZ and most English accents
Only doesn’t in US and some Irish and British accents
eg dijk would sound like saying ‘dayk’ not ‘dike’ in English usually
Your country isn’t a country until it has protesters
I don't disagree that it's bad for business, but surely that's still better than another wave
I learnt loads 10 mins on Al-Jazeera English that I didn't realise was going on globally
I wouldn't trust it to be objective on gulf/arab state affairs but looking out to the rest of the world it's brilliantly broad with concise stories
We heard it too
Horrible news
How is UCLouvain seen
I did my exchange last year, had the same two choices as you, and chose Erasmus
I can say you made the right choice; Rotterdam is a fucking grim city and the teaching at the uni was fairly inconsistent
I met some cool people, but it was pretty impossible to get to know non-exchange students well
I visited Copenhagen since and spoke to some CBS students and regretted my decision somewhat
(Heaps of Portuguese exchange students though if that helps lol)
Moldova is just a buffer state between the Romanians and Ukrainians
imo its like norway but cheaper
Very much, but certainly not as much as Romania, USA or Russia
The government is practically run by coal companies who funnel all their money into climate denial
Meanwhile, what the country is burning to the ground, our PM pisses off on a family holiday to Hawaii
Australia
Not as corrupt as say India, Indonesia and other developing countries
Not so corrupt that it's expected to pay the police like in some African countries
For a developed country I would honestly say very corrupt
Our current leader (prior to being elected) once brought "clean coal" into parliament
It's mainly mining companies, China (we are over dependent on China) and general big business
Corruption has rendered both major parties to be damn near identical
Here's a quick video narrated by Tim Minchin
A bit with some Chinese real-estate developers and mining companies, but it’s far better than in other countries
As stated in the post, Romania has a huge corruption problem does it not
Because Romania has big corruption issues like USA and Russia
It was just an example of countries with worse corruption than Australia
Australia isn't old enough to have classical music, but we do have Midnight Oil's "Wedding Cake Island"
Vienna rocks, it has ridiculously good public transport for the population that lives there
It's one of those cities I could definitely imagine living in
Perth is the second most isolated city in the world (The first is Hawaii), so it's natural that people say it doesn't exist
And Australia
Technically not another language but we have stupid slang words for some animals:
Joe Blake: Snake
Bin Chicken: Ibis
Massive cunt: magpies
Siemens are not well liked in Australia at the moment
We do
Yeah so if you see toilet paper, you're lucky
That's exactly what's happened here, no bog rolls to be found
People are actually getting violent over toilet paper
Meanwhile in Australia
people are buying 12 packs each
Jebiga - Serbian/Croatian meaning "fuck it", multiple ways to use it, like when you can't be fucked doing anything
I'm Aussie with a Serbian background and just taught that from Serbian friends
I'd translate that to a 'longing' in English
You're fucked in English and Germany
And the first computer
We made wifi
The Australian radio-astronomer Dr John O'Sullivan with his colleagues Terence Percival, Graham Daniels, Diet Ostry, and John Deane[8] developed a key patent used in Wi-Fi as a by-product of a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) research project, "a failed experiment to detect exploding mini black holes the size of an atomic particle".[9] Dr O'Sullivan and his colleagues are credited with inventing Wi-Fi
[10][11] In 1992 and 1996, CSIRO obtained patents[12] for a method later used in Wi-Fi to "unsmear" the signal
Straight from Wikipedia
They are very proud of it at the csiro
>The biggest thing is that the firefighters need special training and equipment
Particularly when they need to cut the car open to rescue people
Don't want to cut through a high voltage cable
Often have to cut through the frame at the bottom and hinge side of the doors
Depends on the extraction and access available
I don't think it is weird or negative really, very convenient for monolingual English speakers

Other than that I don't think there are many popular ones

“Ahh shit, here we go again”
I watched long time ago and immediately got addicted
I watched it very quickly
It's so mind blowing
The revelations  as you watch are OMG
Also the musics selected for this serie are sooooo  good
Not European but I would like to thank New Zealand for always sticking with us whenever we went to war together
Hey, we have [Solo] here in Australia as well
Although it appears to be different from the Norwegian version ;)
Our local grocery store used to carry it regularly like 10 years ago
Not anymore
Thinking of moving now
People in rural areas have strong feelings about cities, because this is where the politicians and businesses and news sources are located
This is where *stuff* happens
Conversely, people in cities don't usually ha e strong feelings about country people, because generally they don't even *think* about them
The UK tested their nuclear weapons out in the desert at 3 different locations
However, both the Australian and British governments failed to thoroughly check the areas that they thought were void of animal and human lives
Nyarri Morgan was an Aboriginal man who's family had been living in South Australia for 10s of thousands of years
His very first contact with Europeans was the detonation of an atomic bomb in Maralinga
"supposedly", it was mostly disproven but nobody knows what those quakes really were
As stupid as switching sides jokes, right
Cows milk
Gross
Hmm, not by itself, no
But with coffee, tea or similar things I enjoy it
What is the word for milk in Greek
Probably lactosia or something
Nevermind
I love the Greek alphabet
Would love to learn the language, but it seems a bit complicated
I also found this word
The Greeks are probably the best diaspora in Australia, even with their concrete gardens
Don't know really
When I did labouring work, the amount of grey haired Greeks I met was astounding
They could be in their fifties or sixties, but they put in as much work as people my age
The Italians are quite similar actually
Clever Austrians, making the world think that Mozart was Austrian, but Hitler was German
You guys also get called Sheep shaggers by the rest of Europe whilst Australia bullies New Zealand for the same reason, they also have way more sheep than you
In the UK and Europe, the Welsh are called the sheep shaggers
In Oceania, Kiwis are called the sheep shaggers
Assyrians, Kurds and Jews would also like to have a word
True, thankyou for correcting me
I know the Jews got their suburbs burned in Smyrna, I haven't read up on what happened in other towns
>so I guess we’re continuing with feet on both sides
No, I think the problem is that you have a foot on one side, and approximately thirty centimetres on the other
Oy cunt I’m comin for yah
Oiy Cunt I’m comin for ya
Take a selfie with a snake
Luckily it was a red bellied black snake which, although are extremely venomous, tend to piss off the second they sense anybody near them
Tourist was at least a few metres away from the snake which was sunbathing on concrete at the time, it's still dangerous to have your back to a snake though, especially if it's something like a brown snake which are agressive and venomous
My stomach plummeted just reading the comment, bloody awful
Indeed, the only country with a red, white and blue flag
As a semi rural Australian guy who plans to live in Milan, do you have any tips or links to help me not look like such an uncultured tourist
I've heard that's true
But I've also heard that you all dress more or less in a similar style, and there's not much individuality as there is in some other countries
I don't know how true any that is
That's very interesting and good to hear
I've always found the brand conscious way of dressing a bit gross, so I'm glad Milan isn't like that
I'll need to look into the song as well
Often
I lived for many years in the south of Denmark
I’d do my grocery shopping in Germany (half the price), and go to the dentist in Poland (quarter of the price)
Spend my weekends in Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands
Most of the time your national ID card is enough but always a good idea to have your passport just in case
Christ, I knew Europe was small and dense (in terms of distance between cities) compared to Australia but wow
I live in Sydney, New South Wales, it takes 3 hours to get to the capital, Canberra, and 8 to get to the next largest city, Melbourne
And that's only East coast cities
If you ever end up coming to Australia, trust me on this one, do NOT take a 14 hour bus ride from Sydney to Adelaide, it isn't worth it, and for Christ sake DON'T EVEN TRY GOING TO PERTH
The benefits of Schegen zone free movement really became apparent to me the first time when I spent 9 hours waiting at the Poland-Ukraine border, vs walking over the Poland-Lithuania border and seeing all the dismantled checkpoint infrastructure
It's the second most isolated city in the world (Hawaii is 1st)
It takes 28 hours to drive there from Adelaide, the closest city to it, and the only road between the 2 cities is only a 2 lane road
Not even a Highway
That's why I said "compared to Australia". But that bit about the Benelux is still amazing
And I thought inner Sydney was crowded
With the point of difference being that involves crossing the Nullabor, a place you really, really don't wanna break down
You won't be missing much except for wild Quokkas (Which are only found on a single island anyway, not in the city)
Never been to France but I just looked at the Arc Dr Triomphe on a map, isn't it essentially just a big roundabout
We have those everywhere in Australia, albeit much smaller
Even Canberra's roundabouts are smaller
Apparently, and I'm not 100% sure about this, but the Arabic name for Germany is Almaniã, I've been told this is a loan word from French although I'm not really sure
As an Arabic speaker this is news to me
Chinese Mandarin, it's taught in schools and we have the highest number of Chinese exchange students, therefore many immigrants from China
Would have thought Greek was probably the second language of Australia
The Greek diaspora here is still pretty connected to their homeland
Same with Nepal, Malta, India and many other countries
We're the most diverse country on earth so I've heard
> they consistently tended to refuse to read error messages which were telling what to do
Pretty sure that's global
Kevin Lasagna is a very complex character
He has many layers

A German accent is sexy as hell
You guys are so lucky to be born EU citizens
To OP, if you can go anywhere in the EU, I'd go to the Netherlands or the Nordic countries
The more I learn about these countries, the more I realise they've got their shit together
Smart, practical people
I'm in love with the Netherlands though
That would be my number one
Those guys are truly blessed
Most of them are extremely fluent in English anyway, so you'd be able to get by whilst learning Norwegian
Norwegian is related to English, lots of similarities
believe me, there are many other countries in Europe that don't even get to live a life that you italians have
plus all of the rights and freedoms you guys get as well
Hello, I'm a dual Australian-Italian citizen and I would like to join the smoking weed Airsoft party
Is there any particular part of Italy that is to be avoided for young people like myself looking to start anew
Milan seems to be a great place to go to me, but I admittedly haven't done too much research
Just curious to hear from an Italian what it's like
Very interesting, thankyou
I'm currently at uni hoping to become a clinical psychologist, is there much of a market for that in Italy
I know opinion on mental health can vary quite a lot depending on where you are in the world
scotland and wales population density is MUCH lower tho
The prime minister elected here in 2013 was born in London
He gave up his citizenship 2 decades prior as you can't be a foreign national to be a member of parliament
Any news corp not owned by Rupert Murdoch, which isn't alot unfortunately
New Zealand
Probably been allied for a lot longer but the earliest cooperation I know if is the ANZAC corps and the battle of Gallipoli in WWI
Since then we just have banter with each other and argue about who invented Pavlova and the appropriate name for a thong (flip flop, or jandal in uncultured places)
Despite our arguments, the kiwis have and always will be sheep shaggers

They may take our lives, but they'll never take
OUR EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSHIP
I'm not European so I don't think I qualify to answer this question, but I follow the politics in Finland, Moldova and Belarus
For Finland- I have a personal interest in both the country and it's politics and I'm also learning Finnish, so it's good practice
I became interested in Moldova and Moldovan politics because of its obscurity and political position
Needless to say, I now am drawn in by literally everything that happens there as its so interesting
I always kept an eye on Belarus for some unknown reason, but since August I have been following the protests very closely
Legal drinking age here is 18
People probably start drinking at 16 or 17 at piss-ups or other occasions
So I'd say very popular
I have done in the past but I really wish they'd implement a way to hide American units of measure, either with a separate language for English, or a setting in your user profile
No other language Wikipedia has this issue, but none are as large as the English one
Assuming I didn't die of childhood pneumonia (which was pretty bad tbh) I certainly would have bled to death in childbirth at 20
Dunno what else would be different
Maybe I'd still be a waitress
Guess I'd be a convict lol
Either that or taking land from the Abororiginals
The thing many people aren’t aware of is that Taiwan and China actually have economic cooperation with each other to the value of $150 billion a year
They deal with each other, no reason other countries shouldn’t deal with both
I shake my head when extremists in the US and elsewhere say we shouldn’t trade with China and that we should only support Taiwan
Politically, things are more complex
If everyone stopped playing megaphone politics, the world would be a better place
I guess the whole of Australia must be in the German countryside
If we want to be specific like that, we'd say '24 hours'. I can't think of one time in my life where I would have needed that
So that's probably why we don't have it
Self-evident
From your examples, the phrasal verb "work [something] out" is the closest that covers all these usages
>Skadefryd is another one
In English, they use the German word
They should have their own
And you guys have never borrowed words
Give me a break
We just say 'partner' for that
We have 'allrounder'
And never heard of that second word
And yet we still manage to survive
Nope, that's something I'm glad we don't have in English
There's other ways of showing politeness in English
We'd answer 'Yes, I am' or 'No, I'm not' to clarify
In many English dialects 'eh' or 'right' would be used for that
>You guys should not only adopt the word but the culture as well
Why
We just say 'just right'
Never heard that word spoken in English
Might be American
I've heard Norwegian spoken, and you guys say/use tons of English words without 'Norwegianizing' them (as do many other languages)
How is this any different
We have multiple words for 'funny'
I'm not offended, I just get a little annoyed with some of the comments on this post that claim English doesn't have X word, when quite often we do or we express it differently
As for borrowings, there's not one single language that hasn't borrowed vocabulary from other languages for concepts that don't exist in said language
You seemed to imply only English does this, maybe I misunderstood
English used to anglicise borrowings, but that's fallen out of favour, and nowdays we just borrow the word 'as is' as it's seen as more 'authentic'. I know some languages (maybe Norwegian
) change the word to suit to the language, but English tends to avoid that now
I think it makes English more of a dynamic language, but I can see why other languages don't like it
We do however change the pronunciation quite often, but not always
Maybe we should have had a word for that, but are you seriously telling me Norwegian has not borrowed any non-slang English (or any other language) words that didn't exist in Norwegian beforehand
I saw those 2 words you said in other posts
For pålegg we have spread/topping/filling
We don't have døgn, but we'd just say '24 hours' if we need to be that specific
I can't think of even one time in my life where that would have been needed
Anyway, rant over
Fair enough
Sorry for the rant
What’s wrong with the ol’ budgie smugglers mate
Wouldn’t that cause the same problem the other way, with Sjælland being the same distance away from Aarhus
Yes, it's why they come here
Any time of the day it's like a post-apocalyptic shitshow there
Irish pronunciation I can mostly wrap my head around, but the lenition for dh I'm still completely lost about, especially when it's at the end of a word
The only things I know about WW1 are that an Austrian died, the Gallipoli Campaign and Italy swapping sides
France is not my country - I don’t live in Europe - but i have trouble getting my head around what happened to Louis Braille’s body after he died
On the 100th anniversary of his death his remains were dug up from his grave in his village and moved to the Pantheon in Paris - except for his hands
His hands were left in his village
It seems everyone wanted a piece of Louis
I've read in the end the poms  figured it was better off having him in charge
Also there is documentary called 638 ways to kill Castro
Yeah people forget that stuff like beer were important commodities not that long ago
Hell Australia had the Rum rebellion in the 1800s where the military overthrew the colonial governor because he wasn’t paying the right amount of rum lol
It seems to be the UK (and by extension, all other English-spesking countries), Ireland and Italy that celebrate it on the 25th
Everyone else is on the 24th
It's the same here that the 24th is just a waiting day, nothing special
Same in Australia
It's a bit weird reading these comments
Had no idea Christmas Eve was the main celebration in most of Europe
Here, Christmas Eve is just an (mostly) ordinary day
All celebrations take place on the 25th
I would have thought it'd be January 7 for you guys, being orthodox and all
Wow, thats so different to here
Christmas Eve here is mostly just another day, and all celebrations are done on Christmas Day (25th)
Can't go out on Christmas Day because practically everything is closed
Fair enough
Learnt something new today
Not so much country, but you can usually tell people from certain regions and the ethnic groups that are native to them
I dunno
I get a kinda Scottish vibe from him
But still coked up and picking a fight while his girlfriend screams
Same
I thought it was Itchy Boots
Australia is a big country and I don't live in a tourist hot spot (although tourism is growing where I live) I'd say Sydney and Melbourne
Specifically the area around Sydney Opera house and I have no clue about Melbourne
Queensland, specifically Brisbane and the Gold Coast are popular destinations for domestic travel and I think it's a lot more popular now with international guests than it used to be
It has a bunch of theme parks there which I went to as a kid
Lofoten only started blowing up a couple years ago no
Travel books on Europe from what I've seen often exclude anything east of Czechia
You have to either look at individual country travel guides or get a whole separate 'Eastern Europe' edition
Now I'm not saying Lonely Planet is to blame for the imbalance in tourism but I think it does capture a snapshot of popular perceptions of Europe
Which is a shame because Europe has spectacular highlights the whole way east to west
Minnesota I know thanks to Prince, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash
It’s cold, middle north
California is the Beach Boys, therefore coastal, west coast
The Ramones went to Rockaway Beach and played cbgbs - New York
I learned all my American geography from popular music and Hollywood - not school
We don’t study American geography at all at school here in Australia
Oops, I’m lost - this is r/askeurope
I took a break, but now I can resume writing my resume
I present to you this present
If you can't hear the difference, why don't you record your voice on a record
Both e's should have an accent

There's a role we get our names signed of on
I've been fined $150 for sleeping through an election
We can get a sausage on a piece of bread while we're there, so it all works out okay
How common is that though in your area
Catalan is at least very similar to Spanish
English and Irish are completely different
Ok I see
I've met a few Northern Irish in my time and none of them could speak it (aside from some basic words)
Glad to see it's changing
The environmentalist political party in our country are deliberately lighting fires to trick people into thinking climate change is worse than it is
What’s “Bielefeld “?
Im from Australia, but my grandpa told me one small story when he was living in Serbia or Yugoslavia at the time, he watched one day as a German plane was being chased by a Russian plane
Both just flew over where he lived in serbia, They were fighting eachother, as one was firing the one in front did a loop to a avoid the other I can't remember the story completely I just remember the way he described it sounded pretty scary
>The similarity between Dutch and Afrikaans is a bit scary at times
Maybe because they're very similar languages
British cuisine is also built around the traditional dominance in trade so features spices from around the world, ones that don't even grow there
It's not like Mediterranean cuisine that heavily features herbs that can be foraged on a nice stroll around the village
The result is that when conflict disrupts trade, the food becomes boring
There's probably lots of country people foraging local herbs for fun but that's not the essence of the traditional dishes
Australian, reached Nuisberg because it doesn’t sound familiar
I've seen pictures of these so-called ugly German cities, and none of them I would call ugly
Many of them are very cute
Probably that Germans have higher standards, which is fair
Every single one of those countries would be considered "Eastern Europe" in English-speaking countries
So I guess it depends on how define it
Probably was Duisburg, near Essen and Dortmond

>Well Iasi, Romania is well known to Greeks
Well, clearly not so well known to *all* Greeks
Even though this isn't correct, in my mind there's Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia
I know Russia (West of Urals) is in Europe, but I still kinda think of it as it's own thing
>guau,
What
It's interesting how different cultures perceive animal sounds
Here, it's "woof woof" for a dog
For me, the German/Poland border is where the East/West European border is
Yes it is, but you gotta draw the line somewhere
Like I said, this just for me
I know many in Europe don't consider Poland to be 'eastern', but I do and always have
In the city of Brisbane, it's supposedly illegal to wear pink pants after 12pm
I say supposedly because many websites claim this but I couldn't find any actual evidence to support it
Seems very similar to the famous British TV licence, which I assumed was unique to that country
I don't understand why people think it's hard in English
Like sure you can't do it all the time but in spelling bees at school you would often get a word you have never heard before and have to sound it out
I was pretty good at spelling bees for this reason, my vocabulary wasn't that big but I could sound things out and with words that have silent letters, you can usually figure out where they go (like a double letter or a h)
Written text to pronunciation is even easier because even if a word can't be sounded out, you can usually tell if you are saying it wrong
Maybe this was just me growing up, idk
I will say names often tripped me up if I was reading a book and then watched the movie and the name is pronounced completely different to how I had read it for the whole series
Lol, no I actually suck now
My vocabulary is still as limited and I haven't done any spelling training since grade 6 and I for sure have gotten lazy since we have autocorrect now
And when we ask what it means in English, most of you struggle to say the word
During WWI, a group of Australian soldiers in France spotted an abandoned German tank in the middle of no man's land
Completely broken down and useless, they decided they wanted it anyway
They called bombers and artillery to distract German machine guns on the other side of NML, then rushed to tank and hauled it behind friendly lines with a chain and brute strength
The tank in question was the last of its kind, called the Mephisto, now resides in a war museum in Brisbane, Australia
I think about that a lot actually
Like a water technical
Australian Venturer here, (boy scouts 14-18 year olds, in the UK they call it Adventurers not sure about other countries) our uniforms are very different to those from most countries and we generally don't call it "Boy scouts", it's usually just "Scouts" because we include women in scouting as well (although Guides still only allow women)
We do most of what other countries do, knot tying, raft building, etc
But from what I've heard I think some of our systems and awards are a bit different
The different groups in Australian scouting go from Joey's, Cubs, Scouts, Venturers and Rovers
I know little about Joey's or rovers but I can outline some of the aspects of the rest
- Cubs: The teams of kids within Cubs are called packs, named after a different colour of wolf fur (Grey, brown, black red etc), the cub leaders use the names of characters from the jungle book rather than their real names
There is an award system called "boomerangs", if a cub gets the bronze, silver and gold boomerang badges they receive a grey wolf badge, the highest award in Cubs
- Scouts: teams are called patrols, some leaders can choose to use jungle book names but generally don't, most jungle book references are phased out by now
There is an award system with cords instead of badges, red cord, blue cord and green cord, patrol leaders where a white cord as well
The cords are worn around the left shoulder and are secure by a badge (campcraft badge if I remember correctly) on the uniform
All scouts are "expected" to have their red cord by the time they reach venturers, but I was a little cunt and never got it out of spite and laziness
- Venturers: No team system, these groups are much more independent than the other groups and generally organise their own activities (My group in particular is much more independent than most, we have organised our own overseas hiking trips in the past and were supposed to go to Austria this year and hike the Alderweg trail
) The awards are mostly optional, but the highest award is the Queen Scout Award (Which I think all commonwealth countries have) and this award looks better on resumes than the Duke of Edinburgh award, that's one reason why I'm trying to get mine, the other is that I spite the DOE award because I did the bronze DOE hike and it was shit
Edit: Teachings and Activites in Joey's - scouts generally have a bit more emphasis on Aboriginal Australian culture, because if you think about it then everything Scouts have been doing, the Aboriginal people have been doing for over 50,000 years
i think there was a small roman site they found a couple years back when some people found roman coins in ireland
>Roman baths found under the museum (which was very handy, and immediately incorporated as a big open display
You've got to hand it to the Romans, they were good at planning ahead
Not from Europe, but judging on history and modern times, who owns which piece of land

when i was in bosnia, i asked why there was ketchup, and they said"try it without ketchup" and it tasted like bricks

How common is it to use the English word ok/okay in your language
In the English-speaking world, we use this word A LOT
Just wondering if it's crept into other European languages or not
It can be used as an affirmation to a question and/or to confirm understanding, or adjective to mean something is passable/acceptable ie "His test went ok" (wasn't great, but wasn't terrible either)
We also use it at the beginning of sentences, like "Okay, so this
How do you use it if so
We rarely write 'okay' either, but I think that's the 'proper' way to write it
Is that just when speaking Irish, or do you say that stuff when speaking English as well
Okidoki (okeydoke/y) is seen as a different word, and is a bit old fashioned
We just use 'Ok' 95% of the time
But there's also OK, O.K. Okay is the only other one, but that's rare
A bit extreme
That looks very French
I didn't even know that accent existed in Dutch
TIL
I was taught fin de semaine at school
'Okay' makes it seem like an actual word, and less like an abbreviation (which it actually is)
I think they tried to get us to learn 'pure French' and avoid English words, even if they're common there
Might have changed now
That was almost 20 years ago
'Orl Korrect', which is a play on All Correct
It was invented and popularised by you guys
I only found this out today
Didn't know that one either
I've been saying normalcy my whole life
It sounds like a proper word to me
Just like privacy
I guess now it *is* a proper word
Now I'm confused whether I use normalcy or normality more
I'll just go with both

When most people think of Poland's history, they usually think "Haha, got fucked in the 2nd world war", but its history before that is fascinating
I was very surprised when I learnt that they had a dual-monarchy with Lithuania and owned a huge area of Eastern Europe
I'm a native English speaker, with German as a second language
When I hear the Dutch speaking, my first thought is that I've had a stroke
Sorry Dennis
Yeah, I think once I've mastered German (ha ha ha, never gunna happen) I might try my hand at learning Dutch
There was a Dutch woman (who of course spoke perfect english, and i believe french as well) in my beginners class for German language
Her learning process was - "okay, so I change this and this and this
Right, got it
A friend of mine returned to Germany after living in Scotland and then Australia for ore than a decade
More than one German asked if she was Dutch because of her accent,  or complimented her on having good (But not great) German
In one job interview, she was asked if she would like to speak in English, because she struggled with "professional" German vocabulary
German is even hard for the Germans if they don't practice enough
I speak a bit of Greek and it’s rare I’ll have a full conversation in it, but if anything it’s the reverse - a certain shift in my mood or personality will bring out some Greek phrases, especially when I’m being sarcastic or telling off a friend
Vatican City and San Marino are Groovin’
Technically speaking a double dissolution in Australia is kinda when government collapse, but both houses getting dissolved is kinda meant to happen if government gets complete fucked
I think 1975 during the constitutional crisis when Gough got the boot was probably the first and only time a federal Australian government collapsed
PMs get sacked all the time but government still chugs along fine
Obviously caveat to this comment is I’m not European lmao
Anytime a politician touts policies as stuff that will promote ‘family values’ is a time where you should start running for the hills

My motherland (UK):
*  In terms of the concept alone, the Geffrye Museum of the Home, showcasing interiors from various periods in history
It's currently closed for renos and thanks to covid, won't open until 2021
*  In terms of execution and general swishness, TfL London Transport Museum
A very well presented modern style of museum that I found engaging and relatable
*  In terms of the best thematic soft play area, the Kelham Island Museum
Look, the museum is awesome all round but an ironworks themed soft play was amazing for the kids I don't have and I definitely didn't play in it myself instead
My adopted home (AU): Immigration Museum in Melbourne
Thematically relevant to me so probably biased, but a great and accessibly presented modern museum including an interactive on screen exhibit where you can play the part of an immigration officer in a few historical periods, examining prejudices and motivations at the time
If anyone's still reading, also go see the Museum of London, Chatham Historic Dockyard and the Combined Military Services Museum in Heybridge, Essex, although the last one is an older style item and card note of museum, it's beyond exhaustive as a collection of weapons from history
Oh and Kirkgate in the York Castle Museum
I like museums
I still have nightmares about the Uffizi
My parents are huge history buffs so the year we spent living in Italy was spent travelling around looking at stuff
Which was now that think back on it, really fucken cool
At the time though I was really young so I didn’t really appreciate art and well history all that much
Spent like 8 hours in the Uffizi gallery sick lmao,  I’ve held a grudge against Di Medici ever since lol
I really enjoyed that museum
The museum at Schlinder's factory was also quite good, and an underrated one would be the Silesian museum in Katowice
There are a lot of Eucalyptus trees in Portugal
Garlic is awesome though
Yes, although I’m honestly surprised that it hasn’t been legalised here already considering how much money the government could make by taxing it
Australia has one of the greediest governments in the world
Not European obviously but when I was younger I used to think that all of Europe was part of Britain and everybody there spoke English
Yet again I also couldn't tell the difference between Australia and Africa on a map and I thought Alaska was part of Canada
So you thought Prussia was Pre-Russia
Edinburgh, Seville, Salzburg, Prague, Krakow
Not perfectly East-West, but variety in location there
I think my list is biased to scenic cities though when there's plenty of others I think are top quality
I wonder if you've *really* looked at middle English
I find it very hard to understand without prior study
Thats so weird/interesting that your language is so stagnant like that
But I think it's cool
I do wonder how much longer that will last though due to modern media and communications
I think it's easier for English-speaking (L2) Germans to understand than it would be for a monolingual English-speaker
However if an English-speaker has learnt even just basic German or Dutch, it will become much clearer to them
When these texts, if I read them it's quite difficult to understand
However, when you hear them spoken with the old phonetics - it's much easier to follow and understand
It's not something most normal people would even care about to be honest
I, on the other hand, think this sorta stuff is fascinating
You may find that Finnish is quite different in 50 or 100 years
And I'm not just talking about loanwords, but just the way sentences are structured (or grammar more broadly) and things like that
Yup, that's how i'd know it
I can't speak German, but I would know hundreds of common German words just from picking them up over the years
I've watched 4 or 5 lesson videos on YouTube, so that's all I know of German
But even that still helps me with understanding old texts
Germans are often asking questions like this, or
They ask "Can you explain me what I said wrong
Oh dear,  I dropped articles all the time when I was barely conversational in Italian
Lol I must have spoken incredibly broken Italian, mi dispiace
It's fine
But it's *The* police exists
Wouldn’t be weird,  makes sense to me
It's almost like different languages have different meanings for words
Only in British English
We use both is and are here
Yup, and plenty of other languages change meanings of their loanwords too
It is what it is
We're not going to change the word because of it
It's too well ingrained into the language with the current meaning
There are soooo many English loanwords in other languages which mean nothing like the original English word
We don't bitch about those

I was always taught it's better form to use the same regional spelling and grammar self-contained within a piece of writing
It's hard to keep track of that if like Word just had a universal English where it recognises everything
Australia has a lot of great bands:
- Midnight Oil: My favourite band if all time, they make rock music and all of their songs are written about environmental, economic and social issues in Australia
(Beds are burning is about the stolen generation, Dreamworld is about the construction of the Dreamworld theme park, etc)
- The Chats: A very Australian band, all of their songs are based on Aussie humour and contain A LOT of Australian slang that I don't think many Europeans will understand
I recommend Smoko if you want to hear some of that
If you have trouble understanding any of it feel free to reply to this comment and I'll gladly translate it for you
- Cold Chisel: An all around good band from the 70s/80s, wrote one of my favourite songs which is Khe Sahn
- AC/DC: Need I explain acka-dacka
I have almost certainly missed some, I might edit this later to include more
Waltzing Matilda is a much better tune our current anthem
A Polish mate of mine told us about the same thing

Not personally but I hear the Japanese get real angry when people mention all the horrible stuff they did during the Meiji-era
I figured I'd have a better chance with the Dutch page than anything but it looks like an elaborate joke
I understood the first 5 words then it degenerated into alphabet soup
Not very much from the Nordic languages, only a few words that sound similar to English, but I understand a fair amount of German and a little bit of Flemish because I am currently learning German for my trip to Austria this year
As an Aussie that's studied German I obviously get German and English
Dutch was about 50%, enough to get the gist, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish I got a couple words, recognised a bunch of words I can see being derivative of central Germanic
I know I'm not European but all my heritage comes form there so I thought I'd give some input :)
Intresting
There is some like Roki Vulovic who talk about the war and the soldiers, then there is those who talk about wanting to blow up mosques and stuff like that (Koridor, Miro Semberac, and others) and then there’s ones that sing a mix of the two like Baja Mali Knindza
The only one of those that's half good is Auld Orange Flute, the rest are pretty underwhelming
And the unionist version of "The Men Behind the Wire"  is dreadfully boring- should've named that one something else so it wouldn't get conpared to the Republican one
That's fair, they sure love their marches up there
I was walking around Stormont the other weekend and there was some military marching band playing their way up to parliament

In Indian English, I have heard it frequently called "at the rate of", even when it's not being used in a unit rate context

Possibly worth noting that the standard voltage in the US is 110/120 volts, as opposed to 220 everywhere else

Lovely spam, wonderful spam
Can't forget [Zoutelande] by Bløf also
Lovely lyrics, and as a bonus it's neat to hear the contrast between the accents of the Dutch lead singer and the Belgian featured artist Geike Arnaert
I'm trying to learn Caoine Cill Chais atm, but the difficult thing about learning Irish music is that just because you're listening to a recording of Irish people, doesn't necessarily mean they aren't also butchering the pronunciation
I much prefer Zoutelande actually
The lower key and richer voices help, plus the Dutch language just suits the song better I reckon
Fair enough
I heard the Dutch one first so it sounds far more natural to me, just perspective I suppose
Same for australia
Except we're not confused
The English numbers make perfect sense, to us
It's what we've learnt and grown up with, so we're just used to it
Most English-speakers have never heard of a 'milliard'.
What's the second meaning
If you're referring to the way it was in Britain and commonwealth countries like 70 years ago, no one knows or uses that system anymore
Billion always means 1000 million
It's pretty universal and ingrained in the language now
Ok, that's very different to here then
I also was a child in the 90s and billion was always a 'thousand million', and trillion is a 'thousand billion'. Never knew there was any other way until recently
I meant universal in the English language, and English-speaking countries
I thought that was obvious by context
No, there's the standard meaning of universal (as in everything in the universe, or everyone in the world)
But you can also use it to mean 'everything/everyone' in a specific context
For example 'Eating cheese is universal in France', which would mean that practically everyone does it in France across all ages, regions, cultures etc
It starts with one poolside chair
Let them have their own land
They're not native to here
I think its the lack of a regional accent
Most British people would have a regional accent growing up
Often people might speak great English , vocab and pronunciation wise, but they often keep the rhythm  or stress timing (for lack of a better word) of their native language
>Before that, I'd just use less with everything
Trust me, most native speakers do the same thing
Maybe not pretentious, but it sounds to me like something only older people do or care about
Unless you're an English language teacher, most people don't care (especially young people)
It's like 'whom', slowly going out of usage
Pretty sure every Anglophone person here calls it "kicking the bucket"

In Australia we have a brand of meat pie called "Four'n Twenty".
It comes from the old poem "Four and twenty blackbirds, baked in a pie"

Sounds delightful, is it friendly to visitors
Oh, the Buddhist region where the alien chess guy is from

Not a weird government agency but the way it came about was weird
In the 1940s, somebody through an egg at the prime minister's head during a rally, he got so furious he got the police to investigate it and find whoever was responsible
They turned out empty handed so the PM said "Fuck it, the regular police are fucking useless
" (Not his actual words) So he founded the Australian Federal Police (Aussie FBI) and got these guys to find the guy who threw an egg at him
Unsurprisingly, they too were unsuccessful in capturing the first egg boy
Advance Australia Fair is quite contradictory:

By boundless plains, it means detention camps on shitty little islands in the Pacific

Much better than the voting 'liberty and wealth and prosperity' type of anthems
In Australia we often refer to biscuits as "bickies" and chocolate as "choccy"
Probably, we've been calling it choccy milk for decades
"Good Day"
Ay pulled yeah
We have yellow page phone books in Australia
But I think that's because the company itself is called "Yellow Pages". Or maybe they called themselves that because they decided to use yellow pages
hmm
In Australia it'd be either stockmen or bushrangers, but most prominently bushrangers
Bushrangers as the outlaws of colonial Australia were deep in the Australian psyche by the early 20th century, with bushranging films being very popular, until the government cracked down on them
Australia's most famous bushranger himself, Ned Kelly, also was aware of the cultural impact of it in colonial Australia, when while on the run in the late 1870s, and having briefly comandeered a pub, allegedly made one local lad play the famous folk song "Wild Colonial Boy" for him
Wild Colonial Boy is a traditional song shared in both the Australian and Irish folk traditions (although the versions differ slightly) and which is supposed to be originally based on Jack Donahue, a bushranger of the 1820s.
> Colonial Australia is intriguing to me
When I was a child I found Australian history quite boring, because it really is taught in a fairly dull way, but there are a lot of quite interesting moments in Australian history
On colonial Australia too, some of the tidbits of history that occurred are wild, and not even well known in their own country

We were taught cursive in primary school but next to nobody actually properly learnt it or uses it
Also the school I went to had a rule where you weren't allowed to use a pen until you could write in cursive and received a "pen license" but some people including myself used a pen anyway and if any of the other students questioned us, we would tell them (politely) to fuck off
Most people including myself and I'm sure many of you guys, HATE writing in pencil, so many of the teachers in just let it slide, as they to, knew that pen licenses and cursive writing is fucking bullshit
Vaguely related: In year 6 my school tried to teach us to "touch type" and use both hands on the keyboard when using a computer
They ran 2 lessons of this and then realised that teaching primary school kids the opposite of what they have been doing their whole lives was a shit idea and dropped the program entirely
I was totally paranoid about pickpockets and shit in Florence and Rome
They're just some of the biggest tourist destinations, and that naturally attracts these people
I had a zip on my bag opened on the Rome metro where it was busy, but nothing of value was in there and I kept everything important close at hand

They need some koalas
And be careful that some drop-bears don't sneak in amongst them
Well eucalyptus oil is toxic to animals that haven't evolved to tolerate it, so unless they imported some koalas along with the trees it's not that strange that there wouldn't be much in the way of wildlife in them
Is it like the trans-tasman rivalry between Australia and New Zealand, where if you're in Australia then Kiwis are sheep fuckers (because they have the most sheep per capita in the world), and if you're in New Zealand then Aussies are sheep fuckers (because we have the most sheep in the world)

My house backs onto a lake so we have ducks, plubbers (plovers/Masked lapwing) regularly nest in my yard
Usually in the bottom half where it's closer to the lake and turns into a swamp during heavy rain
So Many Rabbits (I've seen black ones I thought were pets) and Hares
They are a really bad invasive species here
Lots and lots of wallabies as soon as it turns dusk
They're cute
Wish my dog wouldn't kill them
Snakes, specifally Tiger Snakes but I actually haven't seen them but I know they're there because they killed 2 of my dogs
We don't get brown snakes here
Mainly copperheads and tigers
Ring-tailed possums
I've seen them sleeping in trees regularly
Very cute
At night we get barred bandicoots that leave small holes in the yard, wallabies, owls and probably more but I don't see them
I've never seen nor heard a Tasmanian Devil in my yard
This area would be a bit dangerous for them anyway because of the cars

Yeah, sure
I can see why because it’s a time where they had it good and they were on the top, my pop who has lived in Australia his whole life looks back on those times with a bit of nostalgia too
Maybe except the nobles, but they were most English so I don’t think they count
Yeah, I don’t get why the British treated some of their people so badly
For example the 13 colonies, if they did put unreasonable tax’s on them, they could’ve retained those lands for much longer
Same with India when in the 40s they just let million stave, that one I kinda get just a bit because they were at war but they were the most powerful nation on Earth at the time
The British I would say treated Australia alright, maybe except in Ww1 sending us to our deaths in Turkey because it’s lot like it was British boys dying
The huge parts of the island being off limits kinda sucks since Malta is already suck a small island
But when I went to Valletta it felt like London just in the mediterranean
That's actually very interesting, I always forgot how long the Ottoman Empire lasted, I would say the British Empire lasted about 140 years but the Ottoman lasted 600
Tbh I think it brought a lot of good things to the world yet a lot of bad things
My dads friend was born in Germany and she says she never really learned about ww2, she just knew they lost and committed war crimes
This is needless pedantry, I'll admit, but I think a better term for the UK is post-christian
I.e. it isn't really any more, but cultural bases and assumptions can very frequently be traced to its christian history

Isn't that Spanish
I only know it from that song
I've just never bothered to look up what the lyrics mean, it was just really catchy when I was 12
and I just looked it up, and now I realise how long ago my childhood was
I thought it was Spanish, I've now learned it's not
Oh thank you very much
I knew I shouldn't trust Google translate
I see, no wonder I can't find out what it actually means
as an australian
i feel i can answer this and that answer is 2017
i dont know how that topped then, there was nothing special to it- not like our other top tens-
That song was legit awful
The voice crack didn't help
dutch language sweetie i am so sorry
aava .... rest  in peace
Only on anzac day,  which if i remember correctly, is the day when Australians and kiwis landed in galipoli
Yeah, the red poppy is used for remembrance here too, and for ANZAC day
Do you feel like other comments that it's a British tradition
I don't myself
I though this said Australians and was wondering why it was here and was boutta comment on it
From what I understand reading history, Germany is more an idea than a country
The idea of a nation encompassing all german-speaking peoples in Europe, uniting them under one banner
If Austria didn't have their own empire, they could've been included in the German nation themselves
Ah, I see
So if the socialist elements of the March revolution got what they wanted, Austria would've been part of a "greater Germany"
Slovenia is very mountainous, no
That's probably why there are so many different dialects
Usually happens in mountainous countries
>(exceptions I know about are Russia, Poland, USA),
I can't speak for Russia or Poland, but USA definitely has large variation in accents, especially considering it's a lot younger country
I also find it so odd that such a huge, and old, country doesn't have accents/dialects
That's true
And I guess you guys used to be in a union with Czechia as well, so that may have had an impact
I would say that generally everyone in the major cities sound the same, though there are a few words unique to each state
When you get to more rural areas, however, it’s a bit of a different story
Yeah, the Republic of Czechoslovenia ;P
Lol
I'm fully aware of the differences
Just teasing the Slovenian guy ;p
A massive city sitting on an island in the middle of the ocean
It’s a marathon wide
I actually know a lot about Singapore but this always sticks in my head and no one has mentioned it
I like your open-minded, live and let live perspective
And of course it applies to travel anywhere but especially when the cuisine is more culturally different to what we are accustomed to
That said, I have grown accustomed to Singaporean food too and wouldn’t eat a western meal there now
And a Scottish king formed a union between England and Scotland, but Scotland was the junior partner
Kind of like Poland-Lithuania when after the 1444 incident Lithuania's Grand Duke became the king and Grand duke of Poland and Lithuania
Lithuania, although bigger, was the junior partner of the union with Poland being the senior partner
It's not annual
International Rules is a weird beast as a sport for a bunch of reasons
On the surface you can say it's reasonably competitive though
For one it pits amateurs against professionals
On another it favours more heavily Irish tactics and positions and game flow, but is tempered with Australian physicality
Then there's a trend in both countries where the purists who are ignorant of the other code complain because they think it's "Too Gaelic rules" or "too Aussie Rules" so they snub it
And then there's rising and falling interest in it, so not always the best teams are sent
In 2013 Australia said "fuck it" and sent an All-indigenous team just to shake things up
In 2017 there were some quite good tests with great players fielded, but even despite the quality *still* Ireland fielded no players from All-Ireland champs Dublin, nor did Australia have any from AFL premiers Richmond
So like
I love the Irish :)
The Holy See
Tiny by landmass, but fucking huge by influence
Wars over the the known world have been wages in the past from that seat of political power, even today, the Catholic Church holds immense power from that physical seat of residence
Plus we hold the lion's share of the world's uranium and a good chunk of the coal
Plus the influence
And the quality is incredible, they say the Germans make good stuff, but I've been on Irish made medical equipment myself when I was having Chemotherapy, I cannot remember for the life if me the company, but I'm fucking glad of the quality and the job it did
I was impressed and surprised that it was Irish when I was trying to find a model number to silence the bloody beeping
I wanted sleep, and it wouldn't shut up
True, and really, despite politically in some of these regions, and the pain in the arse of getting stuff in and out of them, they are rich in resources, meaning that in the future, economically, they could be pretty decent hitters
And if you believe the theories, politically in the background, the world
You guys are in the same boat as us in Australia, heaps of land, but nothing really out there
Well we are the only country that for the overwhelming majority of its history took up an entire continent, and with a rounded percentage, still do
Newer trains yes
They’re called quiet carriages
We do but nobody ever obeys it
I feel like there is enough demand for a replacement for Reddit aimed at a global context
Something akin to having globally or specifically scoped subreddits, not to exclude, but to contextualise discussions
With a bit better multilingual support and maybe poster flags
globalchat
com/at/politics (if en-EN locale) and globalchat
com/at/Politik (if de-AT locale) would resolve to the same thing, etc
>I've learned that English speaking people never ever respond with just one word
Responding with just yes or no is very rude, you have to say something like "yes, I am", "no, it's not".
Depends on the context
But it can sound very abrupt and defensive if you just say 'No'. Saying 'No I don't' sounds a little nicer
>but our teacher didn't tell us they're used just in the uk (and australia
We say eggplant and zucchini
Those are British names
For a long time, I thought an aubergine was a different thing to an eggplant lol
Only later in life did I learn they were the same thing
Literally all of those are still common and used in Australia lol
It's more like "chai pas". J'ai pas means "I haven't"
In Australia we're the same as the Americans, and say eggplant and zucchini
Do you guys say the 'aubergine emoji' when talking about that
Yup, it was a common thing 100 years ago
Youd sound stupid saying it today, but people will still understand what you mean
It sounds quite pretentious nowdays
>If you say "tomorrow we shall drive to the store
Wouldn't sound out of place here, although it's quite often pronounced 'shell'
I use 'whom' whenever I'm trying to sound pretentious and smart
>yeah I have no idea why "pronto" became a way to say "quick" in English
It does NOT mean that in Italian
Because that's what it means in Spanish, so people probably get them confused
Now I know that it means in Italian, but if I didn't, I would think answering with pronto is rude, like saying "hurry up
I've heard multiple times that Americans nob longer use shall
It's still pretty common here
Yup
There are other ways of saying it too, but still pretty common to say shall
We hear it in old timey movies, like Mary Poppins or Gone with the wind
And that's what you'll sound like if you say it haha
I believe it's fallen out of use in the US, but we still use it
It's probably slowly dying here though
I like names like
Townsville
Cockburn
Broken hill
Mount dissapointment
Thats all i could think of of off the top of my head but there is plenty more
Oporto
Like the restaurant
Munster is also Münster but I think the double dotted Münster is German and the other is Irish
Heraklion
Is that the capital city of Crete, the rectangular island
And Pella (The capital city of Macedonia during Roman times)
Like Sparta
Literally anywhere that isn't Perth, Darwin or the East Coast
I met a Swede playing rugby in holland, seemed pretty unusual
He'd started playing somewhere abroad, can't remember where but it wasn't in Sweden
Not global
In Australia, eggs are refrigerated, unless you bought them from a farmer's market or something
Yep, the eggs are normally in the fridge section
I've been to markets where they're out because the stalls don't have power or what have you, but refrigeration is most common
And most Aussies keep our eggs in the fridge regardless
How fresh is Aussie food compared to European
Born in the land down under
Thanks for the explanation
Was interesting to find out how it was different
Which country has the worst and best food you've had so far
Thanks for the response mate
Some say the Greeks or Russians say they are the heirs of the Romans, but based on history, it  probably was the North Italians or Greeks
Greece has been in the empire longer than the Roman Empire existed (Remember Byzantium existed for longer than the Romans became a nation)
Then the crown and legacy was given to the Spanish, but I'm not sure why the Russians claim the crown of the purple
san marino, does that count
they actually have a legitimate claim to the roman empire since they're the only sovereign state who interacted with the romans a lot and still stands
Everything I know of this is from reading Asterix
>The US is unique in that regard
Australia - "Hold my beer, we're taking the ute to the Drive-Thru Bottle-O"
This is why the English dialect is the best dialect of the English language
It brings a tear to my eye
Edit: sorry Scots
The fuck am I sposed to know
I ain't Scottish nor a pom, I just said English cos of the flair
Probs like Glaswegian or some shit
Yeah nah Aussie accent is not as homogeneous as people think
You got Adelaide then the 3 main types
But since I insulted the Scots by calling them English
They get to use 1 Kiwi pass on me
Can't say what they gave done to remain in power but I can tell you about a ton of bullshit our current PM has done but for some reason still remains in power
Humidity tends to be lower during the day when there are larger temperature differences between day and night
Although coastal regions tend to stay pretty steady, in my personal experience - probably depends on the wind direction and how much the air passes over open water
You tend to notice the humidity more when its hot, as you sweat more to cool off, but your sweat doesn't evaporate as fast
It kills me too
It depends the restaurant, at McDonalds or some bar it’s not weird but if it’s at some high end restaurant then it would be out of the ordinary
So we aren't going with "Swamp German" for the Dutch
I'd like to, but as with most Finnish words, I'm too scared to try and pronounce it
Are all the letters silent
ayy boaty mcboatyface fan here aswell
*Germania* - nice name
Why don't you rename your capital city to that
yes please
Reminds me of my Chilean classmate in our German language course
Teacher - "Sport"
Classmate - "eeShporte"
Teacher- "Nein, nur *Sport*"
Classmate- "*eSssshporta*, es ist gleich, oder
England - English
Poland - Polish
Iceland - Icelish
Greenland - Greenlish
Netherland - Netherlish
New Zealand - New Zealish
And so on
English is a very logical and strict rule-based language
And by those rules it should be Englandic
Why are all the county names of Ireland pretty close between Irish and English, but then Dublin is Bhaile Átha Cliath
Ich bin kein Deutscher
That's ok
I like to ask Germans to say "clotheshorse"
I think what you are trying to say, is that English is "the language of the Engls (Angles)" and that England is "the land of the Engls (Angles)".
The Netherlands is not "the land of the Nethers" (although I would like it if we referred to it as "the Nether regions") therefore there is no "Netherish".
That's a pretty cool bit of history, thanks
I love the name Philippine but as someone living near the Philippines (and not in France) it wouldn’t work
I like Filly for a nickname but there isn’t many good ones lol
Don’t worry mate, I want to visit Austria
Vienna especially looks beautiful to me
Also as an Australian I feel a sense of camaraderie with you guys considering our countries get mistaken for each other all the time lol
Wait really
I have plans to go to Italy with my girlfriend in the future, she often has her hair dyed a soft blue or pink hair
Is there usually any trouble as a result of this or is it just staring
Is it all of Italy or mostly rural places
People complain about the smell in Venezia
Just smelled like a dam or river city too me
It was one of my highlights from when I lived in Italy,  an absolutely beautiful city; also quite amusing to visit considering I lived in Genova at the time Venezia’s rival city
Does Scottish surnames do both Mc and Mac
If so, what are the differences
As an Australian, I for one expect that if I'm not in a country whose official language is English, then I expect to be able to talk to very few people
So I'm not gonna be surprised if I'm in Italy and people speak predominantly Italian
Could of instead of Could’ve
Could care less instead of Could not care less
A bunch of Americanisms also gives me the shits sometimes too
Having said that I don’t mind Americans themselves, just get the shits when it’s my fellow Aussies not knowing their own culture
Obligatory not European and technically not our neighbour but we have had way too many close encounters with China
They have harrassed our planes and ships in the South China Sea, and just last year during the Tiananmen square massacre anniversary, they sailed 3 fucking warships into Sydney Harbour, I can only assume because our prime minister was in the Solomon islands at a meeting about China's influence in the South China Sea and they wanted to intimidate us
More recently however, due to the pandemic, our government has been pissed at China and they have threatened a trade war with us
China is our number 1 trading partner, they can fuck us over economically in a heart beat, and with the Aussie dollar as bad as it is now, China is a serious threat
This time Poland will do the partitioning now
Pavlova wasn't invented by Australia or New Zealand, most evidence supports it being an American invention

German I can understand because I studied it, and about 30-40% of Dutch
I consider it to be halfway between English and German
North Germanics I'm lost, only certain Norse words/phrases
I am assuming he meant Brazilian Portuguese
Where are the majority of Scottish Gaelic speakers based
Also is there much local government support for the language

Not European , however there is a small group here called ‘Republicans’ such as myself who wants Australia to be an independent republic from the Commonwealth
In 1999 there was a referendum on whether we should become a republic or not and the majority of people voted no
Not European but Western Australia did a vote for independence once, they voted No obviously but since then there haven't been any such movements
Apart from Lord Howe Island wanting to be part of New Zealand instead of Australia
We did try and change the name of our money to dollarydoos once
>a lot of people that want Scottish independence
But didn't they already vote against that literally a few months ago
Fuck, it's been that long already
But if it took them 307 years to get 49% of people on the side of becoming independent, a rate of 0
15960912% per year then 6 years is only an extra 0
95765472% which is still 1
04234528% short of the majority needed
Though best reports I found rounded numbers to 49% vs 51% and I'm assuming that everyone in 1707 wanted to be part of the UK, which I know there was likely always a simmering independence movement below the surface
But still, it took 307 years to get the first vote, and it failed, would it be wise 6 years later to have another one so soon
Yeah so it's still another 20 or more years away at this point
Cunt (friend/mate)
Cunt(insult)
The th is almost silent when I say it
But you can hear it just a little bit
But yes, many natives struggle with this one
Thankfully it's a word that is extremely rare to actually say
The good thing about English is even if you use the wrong stress, you will still easily be understood
So I wouldn't worry too much
Just go with whatever feels natural
There are some words that are stressed differently between various countries as well
I've heard people pronounce it 'arch', but the first syllable is actually 'ark'
That's considered lower class to do that though
This is anther one that varies by dialect
Funnily enough, when some Americans say 'height', it can sound like they're saying 'hate' to us
The vowels are slightly different
>Pronounced something like Hedge-eh-mehni, but for the longest I said hedge-a-moany
I'm pretty sure in some dialects that would be considered correct
It's like the word ceremony, Brits say 'SEH-reh-mehni', whereas in Australia (and North America too I think) it's Seh-re-MOANY (capitals for stress)
Is that where they mine the cheese

Have you been bitten by a spider before
FYI: Nobody has died from a spider bite since the 70s, and most of the snakes are really chill, they just sort of stare at you for 30 seconds and then they piss off
Not brown snakes though, brown snakes are cunts and they will kill you on sight
A common past time in Australia is bullying Americans by convincing them we ride kangaroos to school, or teach them about drop bears
Sorry about that
Nah, the only people you'll find riding crocodiles are in the Northern Territory and far north Queensland
If you want we can send some snakes over
We have way too many here
Don't worry most of them are pretty chill, except the brown ones, they're cunts

What is the most beautiful sounding language that you have heard
For me, I find the Slovenian and Persian (Farsi) languages particularly beautiful
That Aboriginals (Australia) were already dying out when the British invaded and that if you really think about it “the British saved them”.
He was an absolute dipshit
Saying that all of Russia was in Asia, Papua New Guinea was a sole island, that we’re going to run out of water (then I mentioned de-salination and she said it’s “to advanced a concept”) As you can probably tell I’ve had horrible geography teachers, also yes I corrected them, but they rejected my ideas
Was the teacher a feminist
Australia's convict heritage is over exaggerated a lot
I could see how he could have been tricked into thinking that

Not European but New Zealand and Australia have alot of banter
But it stops being banter once is reaches the "Pavlova debate". We invented it btw fuck off Kiwis
Righto, drain German
Maybe commonwealth countries
ANZAC is definitely wrong here unless discussing biscuits or war
Yes, about 10 minutes from me there's a Polish shop, bakery and restaurant
Even closer is just a general deli that sells a lot of European goods; mainly Polish, Czech, Balkans and Italian
Also Polish newspapers and alcohol
I think the owner is Polish tbf
I buy frozen pierogi from there, cabbage and mushroom- it's not bad as far as frozen food goes
Also ptasie mleczko I have a taste for since my time in Poland heh
In general though my specific area has a small Polish community; a local soccer club called "White Star" with a badge similar to Wisła Kraków, and a local Polish school and community hall called Syrena
Not From Europe but definitely the Netherlands
I love that country in general
Always better in the retelling
I know the UK's and obviously recognise the French when i hear it but don't know the words
I know the Irish anthem in Irish and English
Hmm not sure I'm too familiar with any others in Europe
I know the beginning of the French anthem thanks to the Beatles
I think this is the norm in every English-speaking country

So we’ll probably catch up to you guys soon
Jesus where do I start
Scott Morrison, Prime Minister of Australia, leader of the Liberal party (right wing, not the left wing liberals in America), professional retard
- Name abbreviated as "Scomo"
- Often depicted wearing a lai and Hawaiian shirt due to his absence from the bushfire crisis because he decided to go on holiday in Hawaii in middle of it
- Often called "Smoko" because Smoko is Aussie slang for a work break and it rhymes with Scomo
- Depicted having romantic relations with a lump of coal due to the fact he is a climate change denier and brought a lump of coal into Parliament and said "Don't be afraid it's just a rock
" And is highly against renewable energy
- In 1997 he shat himself at a Maccas (McDonalds) in Engadine, South Sydney
This is often brought up in conversation about Scomo and he has not confirmed or denied it
He is the joke
idk dude I know some eastern European people whose eyebrows can't go up if they try and Greeks whose skin is plump and wrinkle free well into their 50s - I wouldn't be surprised if literally anybody had botox but it's not necessary to explain a Greek not having wrinkles
still better than my Greek
Δεν έχω κρασί στο ξενοδόχοι.
Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and German
All useful, and I feel I have no hope in hell of learning the first two since they have no English (alphabet
) characters
German also looks very tough
Emboldened by this, I would take a French class, after which I think learning Spanish would be easier (than it would have been previously
French - already learning but it would relieve me of more years of work
Indonesian - see above
Chinese - to make visiting China, Malaysia and Singapore easier and more fun
Lots of people to speak Chinese with in Australia, too
I know it’s r/askeurope but love this sub ... and I originated in Europe
Prolly German, Japanese and French
from i consume a lot of Japanese content and if i wanted to with a Japanese base i could go on to learn Korean fairly easily and German is interesting, same as (though not as much as German and Japanese to me) French but with a French base i could learn Italian and Spanish (or Romanian) fairly easily
Don't be a cunt
There's only a handful of countries in the entire world that have unarmed police
You can read it on wiki
It’s odd that Europeans are taught that Oceania is the continent
I was under the assumption to be considered a continent, everything had to be part of one continuous, large land mass
Here we’re taught the continents are Australia, Asia, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe and Africa
I'm Australia we're taught that Australia is its own continent, but Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and a few other island nations like Tonga and Nauru are part of a REGION called Oceania, not a continent
We're also taught that North and South America are seperated, infact this post is the first I've heard of them being called 1 continent
TL:DR Australia is its own continent, Oceania is a region, North and South America are seperated
We call it Australasia
I was under the assumption you have the bigger land masses and whichever mass the islands are closest to is the continent it’s associated with
Kinda like how Japan is an island but it’s closest to Asia so it’s part of that continent
But to be perfectly honest, Google gives conflicting information about pretty much all of it in that if you just straight Google the word Australia, it says it’s a continent but then if you Google New Zealand it claims it’s part of Oceania but also not part of it and if you Google Oceania it says it’s a continent but also not a continent and instead a geographical region
Now I kinda wanna know what Kiwi’s are taught
Just describing how it was taught to me
What did they teach you that a continent was
And I stated what my school said
Then my explanation was questioned so I did research which is what typically happens when trying to draw a conclusion with several conflicting opinions
But yes, different strokes for different folks which is fine
No we were taught they were part of Europe it’s just the islands around us were considered part of the continent of Australia if that makes sense

That's about it, we don't have a very extensive history
Australian here
We know Kosciusko much better than most people would think, that's because the tallest mountain in our country/island/continent is named after him
Mount Kosciusko is around 2,228 metres tall, and was *"discovered" and named by the Polish explorer Pawel Strzelecki
I've been to the summit myself, very windy, nice view for around 3 seconds before it's covered by cloud and fog again for another 3 minutes
* I say discovered loosely because the Native Aboriginal Australians have knows about it for around 60,000 years, so it would be more appropriate to say "discovered by Europeans"
Most of the more progressive people in Australia want it to be given an Aboriginal name instead of a Polish one
Theres 2 problems that I see with this however:
1) The proposed name for it (Which I don't remember) means faeces in a different Aboriginal language
2) From what I know, the Aboriginal nation of the Kosciusko area didn't even have their own name for it, probably because despite it being the highest point in the country, it doesn't really stand out, it looks more like a big hill
(When I got to the top, I remember thinking "Is that it
", I was quite dissapointed to be honest)
I don't think that the Polish name will be removed entirely, it's more likely that it will have a dual name, as with most other geographical landmarks in Australia (For example: Uluru is also called Eyre's Rock)
Yup, the Great Vowel Shift really screwed the English writing system, and even worse, the people in charge decided not to update the spelling
If you listen to older English, the silent letters make sense because they used to actually be pronounced, and the vowels were pronounced consistently
And now because English is the international language, and spoken all over the world, it's gonna pretty much be impossible to update the writing system and to get everyone in every country to agree to it
Many native speakers would be totally against changing it
I think it's frozen in time now
Also They, they has always been a neuter option for ages
It is only controversial because people learn it as the plural but you probably use they all the time e.g, who left THEIR bag here
North Territory becomes a state, South Australia is demoted to a territory, Perth becomes a ghost town and Broome becomes a huge city
Queensland becomes the new incest and vegan hotspot, and the Aboriginal population finally returns to Tasmania
Not much else changed on the East Coast

Fun hurling story; my mum is Irish and my dad always trots out the same joke any time someone mentions hurling; "to be a hurler you need knobbly knees and no front teeth
" Which sort of fit the description of her grandfather
Anyway I was in a pub in Belfast, and this bloke told me he used to hurl for Antrim; so I repeated the above to him and he turned his head towards me, and without saying a word removed his two front teeth
And even in the English-speaking world, I think this is just an American thing
I've never heard of a "spelling bee" in Australia or NZ
As with many things in America it seems, you take something relatively normal and useful, and turn it up to 11 as a competition
Honestly, I still think French is more consistent with spelling than English
Once you know the rules, it's pretty easy to guess how something is written and/or pronounced
You're right
They're extremely rare words in the most recent years, and I've not heard of a single one of them
I looked at some of the earlier years and obviously knew a lot of those
There's German words in there that I've never heard being used in English
>Its a country where they promote competitiveness and make a competition out of everything, even if it's knife forging or cupcake decorating
Stressful, isn't it
I don't think promoting competitiveness is necessarily a bad thing
I think this is maybe where Australians/Americans etc have a different mindset to Europeans (although as per usual, Americans have to take the concept to the extreme)
But it's why the US is #1 at so many things
I just think it's a weird thing to want to make a televised competition out of
Ok, well I'm not surprised about that
They're basically Americans, but not as extreme and with a Commonwealth style of governance
Well, to be fair, they're usually nerds that love that kinda thing
But I get what you're saying
It would be the equivalent of you guys with a Germanic loanword, which I assume you guys have
To this day, I've not heard of those two words lol
That's how foreign and obscure many of these words are to most native speakers, even to those with higher university level education
No, you're not wrong
I'm a native speaker, and kamikaze is that most recent one that I know (and possibly démarche from 2000, it sounds *vaguely* familiar, but I'm not sure)
My auto correct added that accent, so it must be in the dictionary and 'official'. And I only knew kamikaze as a kid because it was a ride at our local fair
Yup
I can go between NZ and Australia and barely feel like I'm in a different country
It's mostly the scenery that's different, but their suburbs/cities/cars and roads/social structure/economic structure/sports etc is almost the same
uisce (beatha) ?
Yes, there are similarities between the English-speaking countries
I've been to the US, and it definitely felt foreign (but somewhat familiar) to me
Too many differences
That doesn't happen when I go to NZ of course
I've never been to the UK, but I feel like the UK wouldn't feel as foreign to me as the US/Canada do
**NSW** the gift god gave to earth
**Victoria** shit cunts
**South Australia** British sounding snobs with weird dirt
**Western  Australia** I don't know if anyone lives there
**Northern Territory** Aires rock
**Queensland** The Florida of Australia
**ACT** Shit cunts and summernats
**Melbourne** Words cannot describe my contempt for this city
I've always resented this so much
Growing up to Australia, the best school trip I ever got was to our capital city right before primary school graduation, which required a plane trip as it was further away from my city (not even in the north geographically) than Berlin is to Paris
It's so easy to cross borders within the Schengen zone, so you become quite accustomed to not even thinking about it
And then you completely forget to take your passport when you want to cross a non-Schengen border
Don't ask me how I know this
A lot of houses in Australia (Melbourne at least) have these
Good for super windy days that are common here
>the little volcano of coffee
The sound once the coffee is finished is "stromboli" - named after the volcano in Italy
>I have to wait for the hot water to kick in
In most modern places here, the hot water is instant
And all our taps are mixer taps
I guess we might have higher plumbing standards or something
>I also envy countries were people generally know multiple languages, but I suppose we get by quite easily with just English
You've got Irish
>More drive thru in cities: it's a nightmare is you're driving and near a bakery/other shop, just need one thing but can't park
Many just park in the middle of the road wich make trafic worse
I know it sounds good, but that's the last thing you want
All that kinda thing does is increase car dependence
Look at how fcked up the US is
How clean are they in the US
And build over all that beautiful nature
No offence but I find that Italians tend to be pretty parochial about your food lol
Upside of that meant each region of Italy had an amazing unique dish
Downside would be that other then a Macca’s or shitty sushi there wasn’t really much in the way of food places that sold foods from other cuisines
Actually missed getting a good roast lunch from a good old fashioned carvery when I lived in Italy lol
I refuse to believe that most US public toilets are too disgusting
There are free public toilets
In Australia as well and they’re mostly guaranteed to be clean
I would happily pay 50c for a nice clean usable bathroom
If that's the cost to keep it clean and for maintenance, then I think it's fair
Prefer to pay than have a free one where it's absolutely disgusting to use cause no money is being spent on upkeep/cleaning
I know
And they're totally oblivious to it as well
Use the urban spaces you already have more efficiently
France is a lot more densely populated than Sweden
So a lot less undisturbed nature
Do they really want hundreds/thousands of people wrecking whatever they have left
I can kinda see why France does
Ah sorry Macca’s is a slang term for McDonald’s lol
Also I think when you have access to so many different cuisines, your bowels tend to get used to different foods
That being said a vindaloo can fuck me up if I haven’t been eating curries lately lmao
The problem with electric bikes in many places is not having somewhere to park it where it won't get stolen
Many places need to sort out secure bike parking
I love conversions like these
Great way of restoring and maintaining the old buildings
I always used to assume it was just the ninth bridge or something
I've been to a bunch of cities in Poland, and Białystok seemed to have the most different vibe to me, felt more culturally Eastern to me than basically any other big city
I didn't spend too much time in Białystok, but it seemed cool to me
Kinda reminds me of Lviv and I thought it was really interesting with the history of Esperanto
>And of course having little robots everywhere
Wait, what

You think brexit is worse than losing a multi-continental empire
One of our prime ministers went missing at sea and straight up dissapeared
Still haven't found a trace of him
As an Australian, we are also a bunch of bloody foreigners
Lemmino has [a great video] on this
Nope, he just went for a swim and didn't come back
In fact, Harold Holt was an extremely experienced swimmer, so it's not like it would be easy for him to go missing
He was so experienced that we named a public swimming pool after him after he dissapeared
That theory comes from a book called "The Prime Minister was a spy" by Anthony Grey, a book that is riddled with inaccuracies and factual errors, including but not limited to; the impossibility of a submarine coming that close to the shore, and that according to Harold's wife, he didn't even like Chinese food
Can confirm, but I think we're foreigners for much more sinister and colonial reasons
It's an anomaly in history that's never quite explained properly
I guess your government are payed actors in a drama show called “Brexit Blues”
I mean, Australian politics is really boring, I don't think anyone had a reason to want to assassinate him, and the Chinese spy/submarine theory is just plain stupid to me
Just because he was an experienced swimmer, doesn't mean it's IMPOSSIBLE for him to have drowned, so I think that's what happened
Besides, this is Australia, we have far more than our fair share of ocean dwelling shit that will kill you in minutes
In Australia, ALL our waters are infested with atleast something, you just need to either take the right precautions or just gamble with your life
Your chances of dying are surprisingly lower than one would immediately think
From what I remember from reading about his death, the waters were calm, I could be wrong though
Just because there's stuff in it that can kill you, doesn't mean it's going to kill you
Under your logic, a rooster, which has the capability to kill a human under certain circumstances, will 100% kill you if it sees you
What I'm trying to say is, most of the animals in Australia are extremely poisonous and deadly, but that doesn't mean they ALWAYS attempt to kill humans
For example: The Sydney Funnel Web Spider, the most venomous spider in the world, has only killed 13 people
And ALL of those deaths occurred BEFORE the 1980s. Nobody has died to a funnel web since
Just because it CAN kill you, doesn't necessarily mean it WANTS to kill you
And vice-versa
Correct
Quokkas do certainly appear friendly but one can never know their true intentions

Looks like a designer mocked up four different designs and said; "which one do you like
And the board said: "Yes".

>+25 C
> extreme weather
23 and a light breeze is perfect weather
BBQ and a cold drink weather
Glorious
Shorts+t shirts or long pants+hoodie are acceptable at 25°C
Ok going a bit far with long pants and hoodie for me
Queenslander or Darwinian
I'm in Melbourne
The long pants and hoodie is just someone experienced, knowing fully well that the 25 can change to 15 in a matter of minutes
Today it’s 25 c in Perth and I’m wearing long sleeves and pants
Oh, Melbourne, that makes sense
I could do it with a stiff breeze, but not when it’s just pure sun belting down
Depends on humidity as well
22 today on the Illawarra coast, jeans and a tshirt for me
Perfect
Just beautiful
Sure
Where we are positioned, the weather can be very erratic
One day it can be 40 during the day, cool change in the evening can drop down to 20 in an hour or so
Sudden drops lead to hail and heavy rains
November to March expect 30 or more during the day
Not always, but always be ready for it
Right not it's spring
Nights and mornings can be below 10 during the day low 20s.
Also different people take the weather differently
Someone from north Queensland (tropical part) would find Melbourne weather on the cool side
25 for them is long sleeve, for me it's a t-shirt
In the winter, there will be mornings with frost on the grass and cars
Disappears quickly and doesn't stay
I should mention that I grew up in Canada and moved here as an adult
Hope this helps a bit
Four seasons in one day
We have loads of fish and chip shops in Australia, probably more common here than the UK
Plenty of fish and chips in Australia too
Not enough places to buy good pierogi though, I mean there's a few, but not as many as fish and chips places
If you're in Melbourne, I know a decent place
I am actually so I'd love to know another

I mean that’s completely understandable when your options are complete domination by an evil state or still having most of the control and allowing the evil state passage through your country
I'm always shocked discovering, like now, that another great European nation that I thought was unitary with some local councils, is actually a somewhat bickering federation
I guess all federations bicker
Growing up in the UK, I always just thought of them as massive homogenous blobs
Don't forget the "fully Independent" constitutional monarchies like Australia, New Zealand and Canada that are still under the British crown
Independent in every single way except for when you elect a slightly left-leaning prime minister, in which case the governer-general and the Queen of England coup them

Is "let's get fucked up" much of a thing into young Italians 20s? Or is it usually just people who've just become of drinking age
Well the first 50,000 years is the hardest so we skim very lightly over that
The next 100 years is the second hardest so that's covered pretty lightly too
Actually we suck at history, I've learned more from podcasts than I learned in school
50,000 years old country checking in to say "we all have different replies to this comment but there's no doubt it's a good one"
Not in Europe but just for some more data, here in Australia you legally have to be at school until 16 and can only leave on the condition that you get an apprenticeship or some other kind of continued study that goes for a minimum of one year and they supposedly check up on you and fine you if you aren't doing one of those
If you stay at school you can leave at 17 and dont have to do a final exam (there's trial exams but school drop outs don't usually do them since they are trials for the final exam the next year) if you leave at this time you don't get your high school certificate
The final year is when you turn 18 and there are final exams with a state wide ranking system for students who intend to go to uni, if you only want to get your highschool certificate, you just need to show up for your exams (your grading is weighted on your whole year of assignments/exams/class work so you don't usually even have to write anything in your final exam as it's pretty easy to get a pass mark)
About half of the students would stay till they finish the final year for the highschool certificate as many jobs that don't need a degree would at least require HS certificate but many leave at 17, usually the type of people who struggle with classroom based education (most people don't leave at 16 as they have basically have to commit to a career (and usually stick with that specific trade too) 2 years before their classmates do when they choose a degree)
This is all based on a starting age of 5 turning 6 that year (we start our school year at the start of the actual year) which is most typical but it's not uncommon to start a year earlier (or even two years earlier for some smarties) as there's no real rule about it, just when your kid is developed enough for school
Skipping and repeating years is also not uncommon so you can get a mix of people from 17 - 19 in your final year (although usually if someone has repeated a grade they probably would drop out earlier), a guy in the grade above me was really smart and finished at 16 although I think it was a special case
So school for the vast majority of students planning to go to uni is 13 years unless you skip a year or are held back (which can't be forced, usually the school/teacher talks to the parents and tells them it would be beneficial if their child repeats the year so they don't fall behind)
All this is based on NSW and I'm not too sure about the other states (I think QLD don't have Kindergarten) but I don't think they vary too far from this

Nobody really gives a shit about Australian politics so I don't really know many of our previous prime ministers
But whoever came up with the idea for whats now called the stolen generation (The few decades when the government kidnapped aboriginal children and forced them to act like Europeans
) But for more recent leaders, probably Scomo (Scott Morrison) who is our current prime minister and climate change denier
His most notable achievement is shitting his pants at Engadine Maccas in 1997

Was it not the case, back in the old East German days, that East Germans would have holidays in these other countries, since places on the other side of the Iron Curtain were not accessible to them
I say this because when I went to the High Tatras to snowboard, my hist said that German was more likely to be understood than English by some of the older folks

Is it usually just gaelicised loan words, or something else
The CSIRO (Australia's national science agency) invented WIFI
We also invented the chochlear implant among other things, those are the only 2 I can remember off the top of my head
Edit:
We were the first country to use polymer banknotes instead of paper ones
We invented the Blackbox Flight Recorder
And we also invented
Bongs
Wifi
I was always taught Australia invented that
Are there any places in your country with boring, obvious or bland names
Australia is known for having very bland names for slot of places
Prime example would be most of our states and territories: Western Australia, South Australia, Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory
The only "interesting" names would be Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania
And how can I forget, the only place in Australia where snow can be found year round: The Snowy Mountains
That's very dissatisfying
I hope this implied town "Grossgross" is founded by the time I come to visit Austria next year

There's a bit more Delft-related fuckery
A harbour was built on the edge of Rotterdam in order to serve Delft, and the area's now Delfshaven
Then the Schie river was split into four - Delftse Schie, Delfshavense Schie, Rotterdamse Schie and Schiedamse Schie; Schiedam was formed on the Schie just like Amsterdam on the Amstel
I find it all fairly fascinating
I guess thats the same thing with English town names that end with town and ville (Campbelltown, Skyville, etc) and in Russia some places end with grad (Leningrad, Stalingrad, etc)
Very interesting how so many cultures have adopted this method of naming
Yeah but there were a lot of Polish explorers and they had the right to name whatever they found after whoever they liked
Coincidentally, we also have a city called Newcastle just north of Sydney
I believe Britain has one as well if I'm not mistaken
Don't forget Woodenbong, Humpty Doo, the little known Butt of Liberty or my favourite, Nar Nar Goon
(Goon is a slang word for cheap boxed wine, and that gave rise to this [classic meme]
Most British colonised towns and cities adopt the names of British ones
Australia has a city called Perth, and I believe New Zealand as well as Australia have cities called Newcastle
Yeah there's loads of them
Oodnadatta, Coonawarra, Illawarra, Yarrawonga, Kununurra and hundreds more
Don't you also have one that is simply called "The Long Water

Cons: It's not in europe
Hmm as an Aussie I’d say yeah I’m ethnically European,  and our culture obviously is very European but that’s not the full story about Australia and I guess I could say the same for most of the Anglosphere
I’ve lived in Europe and I can say with confidence that I don’t feel European at all,  even when I was in England
We have moved on from Europe,  and while the ties to Europe is strong in Australia, we’ve forged our own identity and the forging of that identity was influenced not just by Europe but Asia and the Indigenous people here
I also know that New Zealand or Aotearoa has had the same case in forging their cultural identity too
Eh kinda,  but not quite
Some aspects we’re similar to the yanks, and in other aspects the USA might as well be another planet with the weirdo bullshit
Cyclone Tracy hit the city of Darwin on Christmas day, 1974
It killed 71 people and caused almost $650 million (USD, 1974, no clue what that is in today's money)
Fun fact, Major General Alan Stretton, the man in charge of the evacuation of Darwin after the cyclone hit, went on a holiday trip to China in the 90s, and was followed by Chinese spies

Yeah I dunno man
My dad's village outside Pescara/Chieti has a couple restaurants that do baked polpetti in a tomato based pasta sauce
Which is effectively spaghetti with meatballs
The kicker is, they've been doing this since the 1930's at least
The idea had to come from somewhere

Whaaat
In winter for us it sets at 17:00 but we are getting 20:00 sunsets in summers while yours set at midnight or something in summer
Australia is having a similar problem, not to mention the fact that some our apartment buildings were built poorly and risk literally collapsing for no reason

Greetings from Australia
I find it interesting that nobody has said anything about different expectations of acceptable behaviour with same vs opposite sex friends
Obviously it works slightly differently for same sex attracted people and I'm bi so the orientation of the friend plays a role too, but for example I'm more comfortable socialising with opposite sex friends in a group or casual setting
Also if you've got a partner,  it's not ok to have close opposite sex friends that your partner doesn't know very well, so if you start dating someone new you might stop meeting your opposite sex friends one on one for a while until your new partner feels comfortable
The thing is defining a country and its founding in specific terms for centuries past is a fraught endeavour, because the modern iteration of a 'nation state' as it is understood today has really only been a thing since the 19th century or so
That's also a reason why I'd consider the occasional talking points that pop up like; 'Ireland was never a unified country until it was under British control,' to be a bad faith argument
Totally opposed to it
How will they fill out the boring tax papers that we native speakers have to

Cool, learnt about this in kingdom come: deliverance
Wasn't it given up to preserve Ukrainian sovereignty and territory, but the Russians have basically reneged now anyway
Yes but no
In fact not only is the language rarely preserved in Australia, but Irish as an "ethnic identity" usually is faded after the 2nd or 3rd generation
Not like the Boston Irish where the identity can last many generations
My Granda was an Ulster-Irish speaker, he didn't teach his kids even though they were born in Ireland
It's a shame, really cool language and everything
My first ancestor out here was an Irish convict
But I'm about as Irish as a potato wrapped in the union jack, whatever that means
Although, I will use my heritage and use the word "craic" I love it
I know all that, my point wasn't that "they're all Irish and/or think they're the exact same as the Irish Irish," my point was the thinking is different to Irish Australians by comparison
Is that chicken parmigiana
That’s not what I think of when I think about schnitzel
My favourite WWI story is about the Mephisto
The short version: A bunch of Aussie mad lads saw a broken down, unusable German tank in the middle of no man's land and thought "Damn that tank is useless but it would be really cool if we captured it and brought it back anyway as a trophy
" And thats exactly what they did
Plus they had German machine guns firing on them the whole time and had 0 casualties
And that tank ended being the last of its kind and still sits in the Brisbane war museum
You have all heard of the Emu war already, but another interesting thing that happened during that time in the 1930s: Chariot racing, but they used motorbikes instead of horses
In this case, a primitive tank was named after him
Most of our country is already a wasteland
r/cursedcomments
The emu war was lost because emu's disperse and run away in all directions when fired at with machine guns
Also they take a lot of bullets to kill
(An emu hit by a truck after the war was found with 5 bullets in its flesh and still alive
It's obvious to most people but I have met some people that believe we are still part of Britain
We got our independence in 1901
True, a lot of people want it changed
In certain districts they get 30-40%, according to wikipedia
Huh
I smash toasties here in Australia, and never thought anything of the fact that my mum as always cooked them, and she is polish
I honestly can’t think of any examples for Australia
Maybe the closest one would be how the British treated the ANZAC’s during WWI
How did they try to present it as preserving Polish way of life
The post-partition end result of having Polish territory and peoples split between three nations seems like a big impediment to that

Yeah that one gets annoying as well, half the venemous animals here haven't even killed anybody on record here, or at least not killed in a very long time

Yep, he's 91 years old this year and has had quite the interesting life
He was born in the Polish republic in 1928, taken prisoner by the Nazis as a teenager, and then liberated by the French Resiatance
He signed up as a tank gunner with the 1st polish armored division and was injured in battle and recovered in Scotland
By the time he was fit again the war had ended, so he spent the next few years with the British army
After that he moved to London, got a job driving the red London buses, married an Irishwoman, and had my dad in '65
Eventually they moved to Australia which is where I was born in 2001
He lives in a retirement village now, and is still remarkably physically and mentally fit for someone of his age
And interestingly, since my father was born in the UK I'm fairly certain that makes me a British citizen too
Robbie Williams is a household name in Europe but in the US barely anyone knows who he is
Finding that out was so crazy to me
A few weeks ago there were massive fires and many people were evacuated, well some people took advantage of this and decided to dress up as firemen telling people to evacuate, then proceeding to rob their house once they’re gone
The Eureka stockade flag, it came from a very short lived revolution during the Victorian Gold Rush, a bunch of gold miners rebelled and fought against the British government because they didn't want to get a license to mine gold
Nowadays it's been used as a symbol of Fascism even though it's history has NOTHING to do with Facism
Australian answer: Literally every city other than Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra
European Answer: East Coast Italy doesn’t get enough recognition; Rimini, Bari, Taranto
Most people outside of Australia I have met think that Sydney is our capital city, it isn't, it's Canberra
Canberra is slot smaller than Sydney and Melbourne, but it is such a boring fucking city, I am honestly jealous of foreigners who have never heard of the place
Turin has that famous Egyptian museum
I’d have thought Genova would be a large city most people wouldn’t know about lol
Lived in Genova for a year,  Liguria is absolutely one of the most beautiful parts of the world and Genova was a really nice city
Best dish I ever had in Italy was a Ligurian rabbit stew,  fuck it was amazing

Or Gold Coast
Surely folks know about Cardiff and Belfast
Scotland is cheating ;)
I think of alice springs more as a big town ahah
It’s not very big (especially considering American desert cities like Phoenix or Las Vegas)
Nah mate I wouldn’t be surprised if Adelaide got more international recognition than Brisbane lol
I don’t know how but my hometown managed to become a big fuck off city yet is still obscure somehow
We Brisbanites probably don’t do a good job promoting our city
Besides Brisbane is kinda overshadowed by the Sunny Coast and Gold Coast
Austria is the least known part of Australia
Even though it’s basically in the title
Perth aus is a really wonderful city
It’s also in the most bio diverse corner of Australia
This exists in Australia too but I don't think it's regional and it seems like dinner is taking over anyway
Perhaps this is an Australian thing, but "Americans know shit" comes off as more, "Americans are knowledgeable on this", whereas I think what you were trying to express would be better said as, "Americans know shit all".
Other native English speakers feel free to correct me
Yeah, 'fuck all' or 'jack shit' rather than 'shit all'.
Where do I start
Fake Aussie accents are horrific
The only people who live in the desert are Aboriginals (Native Australians) and cattle farmers
Not everything with a heartbeat will kill you

Not everything is desert (Just look at a fucking map)

We sometimes call people from New Zealand, "Kiwi's" (Think they call themselves that as well) but most of the time we call them Sheep Fuckers
We also call British people "Pommy", which comes from Pomegranate which rhymes with immigrant
My mum used to call Czechs and Slovaks 'pepiczki'...I never thought I'd see something similar posted

We're just taught mostly about the battles and the holocaust
We don't learn much about the second world war

Australia being similar to New Zealand, chicken is most common and everything else is pretty rare, but in some very (very) rural areas, emu meat isn't an uncommon sight
Have you tried emu
If you have, you'll realise why it's not commonly eaten in Australia
I often find thar foreigners will do a shitty imitation of an Aussie accent and say "Throw anotha shrimp on the barbie
" To which I politely remind them that "***NOBODY IN AUSTRALIA EATS FUCKING SHRIMP WE EAT PRAWNS YOU DIMWITTED CUNT***"
Kiwis don't mock our accents though, we mock theirs and call them sheepfuckers
"Fush en chups"
Me and one of my friends have been trying to teach our Swedish friend to pronounce the letter J, when talking to my friend she always calls him "Yack" instead of "Jack".
We've discovered that she can only pronounce the letter J when she pronounces the G in the word "Charger" but we can't get her to make that sound in any other word
One of my mates has a very strong British accent, you would think we would bully him about it but NO, he is the one that starts arguments with us on how to pronounce the word "herb" (He thinks the H is silent so it's supposed to sound like "erb")
The joke was on him though once we found out he was a furry
It's very strange thinking about the different sounds in languages, you think you know all the sounds until you try to pronounce a foreign word and nearly summon a demon
You'd really like Melbourne (Australia) then
this comment speaks to me though I don't listen to black metal
Might have something to do with that's where our queen lives
It's actually POHM (prison of her majesty)

We are SUPPOSED to be able to get around without a car but Sydney transport is a fucking joke and has problems with the train and the new self driving metro system every 10 minutes
Why don't they just use the subways built by the ancient Romans

I've seen reports that in the north, as areas that had permafrost or always covered in ice begin to warm, there are interesting finds
But anything organic that has been "deep-frozen" will quickly decay
It's a race against time to find stuff as the ice recedes
Australia has these things called Opal Cards
You store money on them and then you can just tap them a scanner when getting on and off a bus or train
Can we mention Father Ted
Or quote anything from it
I’ve been to Luxembourg and a lot of responses from got from friends were “I thought that was a German city”
Germany starts demanding other countries food, they give it to him to get him to shuttup but then he starts demanding more and eventually starts a massive food fight
I think Britain would agree with you, and wanted to leave until they remembered all they have in the fridge at home is pickles and mayonnaise
Also you guys invented the Cyrillic alphabet, it wasn't Russia (Which some people seem to think they did)
Best fish and chips in the world
Some people call you guys slavs
Linguistically that obviously isn't the case, but from a cultural standpoint there may be some similarities to your neighbouring countries
How often do you go to the dentist
And what's the average in your country
I usually go 2-3 times a year for a checkup and clean
Wondering how it is in Europe
Edit: this can also include dental hygienists
I like to keep them in good shape and I admittedly don't clean them as thoroughly and as regularly as I should
Plus it's all covered by my insurance anyway
Hasn't been so regular lately though, due to covid
You're asking for problems later on, just so you know
>(which is done by an hygienist but in the same clinic as the actual dentist one, so "going to the dentist" sometimes refers to the clinic and not to the professional
Same here
I would definitely count seeing a hygienist as a 'dental visit'
You quite often can't see what's going on inside the teeth
That's why checkups (with x-ray) are important, at least every couple of years
Same here
Some of the larger places have hygienists, but all my dentists have done my cleanings
>only removes tartar (is this the right word
Yes it is, although I've noticed dentists use the word 'calculus' for it now, so it's replacing the word "tartar', at least here where I live
>I can barely put food on the table
Fair enough
Although I'm surprised to hear this, considering you're from Norway
It’s amazing how quickly people shut up when you correct them about your nationality after over hearing them rant about you lol
Happened to me when I was in Italy lmao
People get super embarrassed
Not European but the song "Treaty" by Youthu Yindi is mostly in English but incorporates Aboriginal (Native Australian peoples) languages and instruments
It's a song about the oppression and land seizure of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers
Probably George Pell's trial(s)
He was a Vatican Cardinal living in Melbourne, Australia
He was accused of sexually abusing and harrassing children in the 90s.
He didn't spend long in prison though, that cunt bastard and the rich fuckers in the Vatican managed to spend enough of their hoarded wealth to get him out
lotta people in a smol area and looks amazing from space at night

Waltzing Matilda
Every Australian knows at least part of it, it's basically our unofficial anthem
Waltzing Matilda is the unofficial Australian national anthem
Thought it was either Moskau or 99 Luft Balloons
I love those songs as well
But I still think Waltzing is more well known and associated with Australian identity
Sounds of then - GANGajang and any Midnight Oil song are also good

In English if you asked someone to name vowels they'll give you a e i o u 98% of the time
"Vowel sounds" is a better way to get across what you're describing, which practically goes unthought of in the Anglosphere unless you are learning another language
Lmao dude if the dictionary AND all native speakers disagree with your terminology maybe it's you who is uneducated
Vowel does not have the meaning you think it does in English
You are thinking of vowel sounds, maybe this is different in Polish, but it is not the case in English
[Here] is an example of an 'incorrect word' being defined in the dictionary
You should read the FAQ about that word
I think it will help you understand a bit more about prescriptive and descriptive dictionaries
Dictionaries primarily exist to convey what people mean when they say words, regardless (not the nonstandard irregardless) of whether you consider it proper
In the linguistics unit I took at university, the word vowel referred to letters and the phrase 'vowel sounds' was used to refer distinguish the two meanings
I'm not going to keep arguing with you, you should just know that when speaking English, that is not how people will interpret that word, so if you wish to use the language to communicate, there you go
Hey dad

Historic ones are the PLC, Unification of Poland by the Piasts
Modern ones are Congress Poland, Poland-Soviet war (Where Poland got Vilnius and half of Belarus and Ukraine until 1939)

Would you say a lot of this is generational as well
So it’s a multiplier of the urbanites x the younger generation voting left, and the rest voting right
I’ve always found the youth of Warsaw to be so progressive, so I was rather surprised when I saw the way people voted
Thank you for the response and the articulation
Really appreciate it
Western Australia had an independence movement a long time ago but it's mostly dead now
Closest thing I can think of now would Lord Howe island, which doesn't want independence, it just wants to be part of New Zealand instead of Australia
I don't blame them tbh

The gap between the way the royals/aristocracy/upper class speak and the way the 'commoners' speak is getting less and less each year

When I was a kid I thought Spain was in Siberia and Bulgaria wasn't a country
Maybe he thought it was the Cape Verde of Portugal
Poland and Sweden did have a history
We heat up to 18 in winter and down to 24 in summer, though we only have one cooled/heated room in the house  so usually just use fans until it's over 40
I'm pretty sure there was an ad campaign on TV advocating either 24 or 25 for air con because it puts a huge strain on our electrical grid
when my dad was little and had been living here probably about a year, so probably around 1968, his aunty visited from back home and was shocked that the family had a barbecue and ate outside "like gypsies
same here, it's not fancy behaviour but who says we need to be fancy all the time anyway
Haha
Just "on the other hand" but as someone with a Spanish vocabulary of about a dozen words, although we don't have the phrase "other side" in English, I did understand exactly what it meant
"Australia is a very confusing place, taking up a large amount of the bottom half of the planet
It is recognisable from orbit because of
many unusual features, including what at first looks
like an enormous bite taken out of its southern edge; a wall of sheer cliffs which plunge deep into the girting sea
Geologists assure us that this is simply an accident of geomorphology and plate tectonics, but they still call it the "Great Australian Bight" proving that not only are they covering up a more frightening theory, but they can't spell either
The first of the confusing things about Australia is the status of the place
Where other land masses and sovereign lands are classified as either continent, island, or country, Australia is considered all
three
Typically, it is unique in this
The second confusing thing about Australia are the animals
They can be divided into three categories: Poisonous, Odd, and Sheep
It is true that of the 10 most poisonous arachnids on the planet, Australia has 9
of them
Actually, it would be more accurate to say that of the 9 most poisonous arachnids, Australia has all of them
However, there are curiously few snakes, possibly because the spiders have killed them all
But even the
spiders won't go near the sea
Any visitors should be careful to check inside boots (before putting them on) under toilet seats (before sitting down) and generally everywhere else
A stick is very useful for this task
Strangely, it tends to be the second class of
animals (the Odd) that are more dangerous
The creature that kills the most people each year is the
common Wombat
It is nearly as ridiculous as its name, and spends its life digging holes in the ground, in which it hides
During the night it comes out to eat worms and grubs
The wombat kills people in two ways: First, the
animal is indestructible
Digging holes in the hard
Australian clay builds muscles that outclass Olympic weightlifters
At night, they often wander the roads
Semi-trailers (Road Trains) have hit them at high speed, with all 9 wheels on one side, and this merely makes them very annoyed
They express this by snorting, glaring, and walking away
Alas, to smaller
cars, the wombat becomes an asymmetrical launching pad, with results that can be imagined, but not adequately described
The second way the wombat kills people relates to its burrowing behaviour
If a person happens to put their hand down a Wombat hole, the Wombat will feel the disturbance and think "Ho
My hole is collapsing
" at which it will brace its muscled legs and push up against the roof of its burrow with incredible force, to prevent its collapse
Any unfortunate hand will be crushed, and attempts to withdraw will cause the Wombat to simply bear down harder
The unfortunate will then bleed to death through their crushed hand as the wombat prevents him from seeking assistance
This is considered the third most embarrassing known way to die, and Australians don't talk about it much
At this point, we would like to mention the Platypus, estranged relative of the mammal, which has a duck-bill, otter's tail, webbed feet, lays eggs, detects its aquatic prey in the same way as the electric eel, and has venomous barbs attached to its hind legs,
thus combining all 'typical' Australian attributes into a single improbable creature
The last confusing thing about Australia is the
inhabitants
First, a short history: Some time around 40,000 years ago, some people arrived in boats from the north
They ate all the available food, and lots of them died
The ones that survived learned respect for the balance of nature, man's proper place in the scheme of things, and spiders
They settled in, and spent a lot of the intervening time making up strange stories
Then, around 200 years ago, Europeans arrived in boats from the north
More accurately, European convicts were sent, with a few deranged and stupid people in charge
They tried to plant their crops in Autumn(failing to take account of the reversal of the seasons when moving from the top half of the planet to the bottom), ate all their food, and a lot of them died
About then the sheep arrived, and have been treasured ever since
It is interesting to note here that the Europeans always consider themselves vastly superior to any other race they encounter, since they can lie,
cheat, steal, and litigate (marks of a civilised
culture they say) - whereas all the Aboriginals can do is happily survive being left in the middle of a vast red-hot desert, equipped with a stick
Eventually, the new lot of people stopped being
Europeans on Extended Holiday and became Australians
The changes are subtle, but deep, caused by the mind-stretching expanses of nothingness and eerie quiet, where a person can sit perfectly still and look deep
inside themselves to the core of their essence, their reasons for being, and the necessity of checking inside your boots every morning for fatal surprises
They also picked up the most finely tuned sense of irony in the world, and the Aboriginal gift for making up stories
Be warned
There is also the matter of the beaches
Australian beaches are simply the nicest and best in the entire world
Although anyone actually venturing into the sea will have to contend with sharks, stinging
jellyfish, stonefish (a fish which sits on the bottom of the sea, pretends to be a rock, and has venomous barbs sticking out of its back that will kill just from the pain) and surfboarders
However, watching a
beach sunset is worth the risk
As a result of all this hardship, dirt, thirst, and wombats, you would expect Australians to be a dour lot
Instead, they are genial, jolly, cheerful, and always willing to share a kind word with a stranger,
unless they are an American
Faced with insurmountable odds and impossible problems, they smile disarmingly and look for a stick
Major engineering feats have been performed with sheets of corrugated iron, string, and mud
Alone of all the races on earth, they seem to be free from the 'Grass is Greener on the other side of the fence' syndrome, and roundly proclaim that Australia is, in fact, the other side of that fence
They call the land "Oz", "Godzone" (a verbal contraction of
"God's Own Country") and "Best bloody place on earth, bar none, strewth
" The irritating thing about this is they may be right
There are some traps for the unsuspecting traveller, though
Do not under any circumstances suggest that the beer is imperfect, unless you are comparing it to another kind of Australian beer
Do not wear a
Hawaiian shirt
Religion and Politics are safe topics of conversation (Australians don't care too much about either) but Sport is a minefield
The only correct answer to "So, howdya' like our country, eh
" is "Best
{insert your own regional swear word here} country in the world
It is very likely that, on arriving, some cheerful Australians will 'adopt' you, and on your first night, and take you to a pub where Australian Beer is served
Despite the obvious danger, do not refuse
It is a form of initiation rite
You will wake up late the next day with an astonishing hangover, a foul-taste in your mouth, and wearing strange clothes
Your hosts will usually make sure you get home, and waive off
any legal difficulties with "It's his first time in Australia, so we took him to the pub
", to which the policeman will sagely nod and close his notebook
Be sure to tell the story of these events to every other
Australian you encounter, adding new embellishments at every stage, and noting how strong the beer was
Thus you will be accepted into this unique culture
Most Australians are now urban dwellers, having
discovered the primary use of electricity, which is air-conditioning and refrigerators
Typical Australian sayings
"G'Day
"It's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp
stick
"She'll be right
"And down from Kosciusko, where the pine clad ridges raise their torn and rugged battlements on high, where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze at midnight in the cold and frosty sky
And where, around the overflow, the reed beds sweep
and sway to the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide
The Man from Snowy River is a household word today, and the stockmen tell the story of his ride
Tips to Surviving Australia
Don't ever put your hand down a hole for any
reason whatsoever
We mean it
The beer is stronger than you think, regardless of how strong you think it is
Always carry a stick
Air-conditioning
Do not attempt to use Australian slang, unless you are a trained linguist and good in a fistfight
Thick socks
Take good maps
Stopping to ask directions only works when there are people nearby
If you leave the urban areas, carry several litres of water with you at all times, or you will die
Even in the most embellished stories told by
Australians, there is always a core of truth that it is unwise to ignore

It's called a donkey vote or a protest vote
You show up to get your name marked off and leave the cards blank or draw dicks on it or write a short message etc
So was Brexit being a 52-48 split cause scores of people thought it was pointless to go out to vote for the status quo

You can have museums be a collection of items from around the world AND not do it via theft
Museums/galleries loan stuff out all the time, meaning the things travel the world and are in different museums all the time
So instead of filling a museum with stolen artefacts, you instead fill it with artefacts you purchase legitimately or have loaned/borrowed from their original owner with their permission
I've seen art galleries do this all the time
A returning of the English theft artefacts does in no way mean the museum ends up with only British stuff, it is a nonsense presupposition
This is not the result of returning the artefacts, nfi why it would even be considered

Important to note that this is just Minsk, Protests have been taking place in multiple towns and cities in Belarus all across the country today with pretty significant crowds emerging there as well
im starting to see people saying its at 200'000 with numbers rising, not sure if true but the crowd is definitely huge
Just like in some US cities they blocked off Black Lives Matter paint on the road
Plot twist: it's a summer photo

Good luck over there

To get those speeds in Australia it can cost anywhere from $150-$600 a month
On 150 those are "theoretical maximums with an average evening speed of 250mbps
For 600, after paying hundreds if not thousands for a dedicated line to your home, you get a garunteed symmetrical 1000/1000 plan
I have access to those because they came with my unit
Fuck no I'm not spending a fuckton for it
I now only get 46mbps for $60/month
Telstra, NBN Co
and the LNP are keeping the country that invented WiFi in the past
LMFAO, crying in Australian
I pay around $70 for anything around 40 mbit

It's not though, they edited it after the post, multiple people have mentioned this
It's also a joke, they're not don't literally believe the US is a 3rd world country
Surprised you didn't catch that with all your wit
Also many of the students abroad will have been travelling not studying in the US, holidays exist
Do I?
Edit: I feel its not fair to only answer with two words and not address your question
I wouldn't see I have a "very large" number of comments critical about the US but I will admit I am critical of the US government
I think this is majorly because the US government to me represents probably one of the worst ways to run a first world country as powerful and full of potential as the US is
The people I like (for the most part, the arrogant US tourist stereotype can be accurate to some extent, but that goes with almost all stereotypes) but the government is absolutely shit in my opinion
Refresh the page, I edited my comment a couple minutes ago so you might not have seen it
I think I did answer it pretty well, my main issue is with the US government, not the people at all
I've never personally had a bad experience with the US but I've had friends who have, so it's not just things I've read online or whatever
Ive been very critical of New Zealand (a country I call home, despite being Australian) but conversation surrounding NZ governmemy isn't exactly something that comes up very frequently outside of NZ circles and I am in support of the large majority of the decisions made by the NZ governmemt, yet I can still be critical of the counties infrastructure

Russia lost tens upon tens of millions of people to the Nazi's. If the Nazi's didn't have to hold off the western front, back up the Italians, fend off Africa, they would have been steam rolled
The whole of Europe, besides Britain would have become the German empire
Including Russia, if not for Britain and it's allies
The Americans were only there because of Britain
The Australians, Kiwis, Canadians, and the rest of the commonwealth would not have been there without Britain

Because many Western countries have made it far too economically enticing for peoples from around the world to come
They have no reason to abandon their culture, because they did not move to these new countries for cultural reasons, they moved for economic ones
This is the repeated failure of these countries to enforce and champion their own values, and require that these people coming in assimilate and conform to the culture of the country they live in
For far too long it has been Western countries that have been conforming to the cultures of these people who have immigrated, rather than the other way around, which is complete insanity
I really don't think the problem is that the people with the news agenices are opposed to the idea of showing those cartoons
I think many of those people are terrified of what might happen to them if they show them, even if they won't ever actually admit that

I visited Finland once, I had flown from Brisbane ~35-38°C to Helsinki which was in a suspiciously warm December at ~0°C. Every shop or building I went into had the heat cranked up though, and it was too hot inside for me
I was taking off and putting on jackets and gloves and hats and scarves and all sorts of bullshit constantly
Yet all the locals just seemed perfectly comfortable inside or outside without all this clothing management

I really disliked the Churchill episode but one of my biggest gripes with modern content is how they whitewash things
It's so disrespectful to set something x years in the past and add a y character and have it all peachy
Blacks or gays or whatever is added, I hate to see a gay added and the main character JUST MAGICALLY HAPPENS to be one of the <1% of people who were okay with it during that time period
You see it most lately with African-Americans added to US tv shows or films
Once or twice is fine, but it's become a massive trend lately and I hate it
It's like they're so scared that if any of their protagonists are racists (which they probably would be given that time period) they would completely lose the audience, but I'd hope people were mostly smarter than that tbh

This is dumb
The USSR never achieved socialism, as the state never handed power back to the workers
Communism is a stateless, classless, moneyless society in which the means of production are publicly owned by all
The Soviets never publicised the MoP, instead they promised continually that they would achieve communism soon (Like China does today despite having the 2nd highest amount of billionaires in the world)
They were also imperialist and Stalin was a racist cunt
The sources used are also very suspicious, the Black Book of Communism has a reputation for being terrible and PragerU is alt-right garbage
This seems like anti-communist propaganda written by right wing chuds
P.S. I'm not a tankie, I'm an anarchist
They killed anarchists first
PragerU is correct

I personally do not want to live under a communist government
However I also do not like the constant mischaracterisation of communism by so many people
Totalinarianism is what people are usually decrying when they talk about the horrors of communism
If you think that communism inevitably leads to totalinarianism that's fine (and even reasonable) but it's either dishonest or ignorant to proclaim them as the same thing

what type of question is that
of course having less of your population whore themselves out is a good thing, what good comes from having girls being exploited for porn
Your know that multiple things can be true at the same time right
Porn is something that takes no skill, its literally trading your dignity for money which is why people look down on pornstars
At the same time because so few women want to participate in porn, women are exploited via human trafficking, drugs, debts, mental issues ect
which is why its also sad
yea no, "acting" in porn consists of degrading yourself and your body for money, its something any person can do and takes no skill
You are trading your dignity for money, which is why people look down on it
There is a reason why most pornstars are fucked up, whether that be because of exploitation, drugs, mental issues or some other problem in their life

Release them and get the whole world on your side
Seems pretty simple to me
Surely, as a German of all people, you are familiar with the concept of a false flag attack, [no]
about the su-57 - Russians haven't even introduced it to their airforce yet, hasn't seen any use as an air superiority fighter, and by most accounts it's largely undeveloped
Certainly on paper it seems like an extremely capable aircraft comparable to an f22, but then again India didn't purchase them as they believed it didn't meet performance expectations
So in this way there is not really a high degree of certainty that it would be able to flat out down 10 f-16's.
Happy yuri night
Looks like there's a certain *haven* I'll need to visit
Hello
Great, back to normal here, just wishing we could have visited for a white Christmas
Heres hoping for 2022
How about yourself
"Babe, it's 4 P.M."
thank u for being suck great mods :)
Not sure what it is about it but I always liked the sound of the Czech language
Little do they know it's just OP's Mum's dildo
Wow, summer is hitting you guys early
Oh dear god, those are negatives
It's warmer in Iceland than in the Netherlands right now
that's some messed up weather
username checks out
[Ahh yes, with the scene where a set of helicopters transporting the English Royal Family instantly freezes above Scotland and they all die in a violent burst of flames
In a cold snap
in a mega-hurricane
above Scotland
EDIT: violent burst of ice, snow, mutilated arms and royal paraphernalia
I was there last year August when it was 33-36 for all the days I was there
You have a whole day planned for activities, but by 1pm you are just fucked and want to go hide somewhere with aircon
Not being pedantic but the royals are mentioned in a later news bulletin
It sounds like you need electoral reform in the presidential elections
I'm not hugely familiar with the French system but it is two elections with no preferencing right
It seems like it could be reformed into a single election with instant run off or some other preferential system instead
Eh, I've seen bigger
- Australian
Is there preferential voting included in that
*Freedom
In QLD, Australia you don't need to
You put as many numbers as you want down the list, leave the rest blank
You can just put 1 and leave the others blank, or you can fill them all out
I do my best to find out as much as I can for all parties and generally have a top 15 and a bottom 15 and the rest can be a bit of a gooey mix in the middle
I think a lot of Brits wouldn't have a clue about what you were referring to if mentioning 'Las Malvinas'.
Because they're called the Falklands
And, at the moment, anything to do with the EU would annoy everyone, no matter which way one voted, because it is simply going to dominate our lives until the day we're out
Hang on, no it won't. It will still annoy everyone because people will still blame the EU even when we are out
As a Brit (meaning I can speak English) the title is far more irritating than the Falklands quip
And for Australians
Clearly if there is a pretender to the throne outside Europe it should be us
>Meanwhile, Sweden's arrogant brother in the West(Norway) is and has been at 99% renewable energy for decades
Norway also exports hundreds of billions of NOK in oil and gas
if you're doing concrete work get some of the ash as it would make good concrete (in theory)
You used "scuffed" properly so I reckon you're doing pretty good, cunt
Hey man, seriously don't stress about your English skills, if you are speaking English with a native speaker, it is their job to understand you regardless of how proficient you think you are
I would absolutely love if someone spoke to me in English to practice their speaking
But I completely understand how you feel because I tried my hand at learning Swedish and I'm shit at it :P
My knowledge of swedish is basically: I think I could do pretty well introducing myself with casual formalities but generally any question beyond "varifrån kommer du” and "hur mår du" I'll struggle with
If you have any questions about English grammar or other rules I'll be happy to help you :) unfortunately I don't know enough swedish to ask about anything in particular
It's just the whole "ett" and "en" thing that annoys me greatly
It isn't like "a" and "an" in English that have specific rules :(
I mean didn't China already kind of do that with Tibet
Also note that there will be some value-added benefits of this:
* Large amounts of wind turbines could be located along the dam wall, generating energy
* The dam walls would be able to carry an electrical grid, spreading out electricity availability
* The dam walls would also be able to carry water pipes, and thus fresh water could be piped around Europe where needed
* Desalination plants can be built along the western sections of the wall, powered by the wind turbines above, and providing fresh water if lack of rainfall is an issue
* The dam walls would also have a railway, allowing freight and passenger traffic along them
As well as a highway
* The eastern side of the dam walls can also have port facilities located there, allowing freight to be imported/exported via the rail system
* Fish farms on both sides of the wall can be built to both provide a seafood industry, as well as to replenish the stocks of wild fish which are very low at the moment
* Housing can be located on the dam wall, opening up the wall to be a population centre as well, especially for those who work on the wall in the ongoing industries mentioned above
also all the WW1/2 wrecks too
Madlads
Great
Wow
Have you tried practicing at the thing you want to be good at
And if you split Asia Pacific into Asia and Pacific, I'm almost certain that the Pacific would come on top of Europe for renewables, some parts of Australia have had days of completely renewable energy
*laughs in Australian*
Welcome to Australia
*Laughs in Australia*
Great cream cakes ;)
I was about to quip that it was a little more than one, remembering one or two where a small portion of the passengers survived
But [Wikipedia has a surprisingly
long list] with several cases having most passengers survive
Same in Australia
only if you do the same for capitalism
YES ICELAND
Why can't we have a based president like Jóhannesson
Wings aren't the same as chicken pieces though
The pieces usually have 2-3x as much chicken
Sorry Belgium
But could have just as easily burnt Wales
I thought Belgium was smaller than that
And it's still early in the fire season
Yep
Took me a while lol
My purple one's still got a good 9 years on it
Gonna be a while before I have a (real) blue one of my own
I suppose I should savour the purple while it lasts
I wave my private parts at your Aunties
The first mountain I ever snowboarded on
Meanwhile in the us
I imagine a phrase you'd need there is; "gdzie jestem
" Cause it looks easy to get lost
In that case it actually was the journalist who caught trouble for the incident for cropping the conversation down
Yeah, then we made him Prime Minister after that
Love how Turkey is Europe but Russia isn't.
This subreddit smh
I can't see how Turkey (and some other countries) are "EU"
Stopped there last year on my Euro trip
At the current rate it'll be a corporate logo instead
The Russians made the Buran orbiters to be their version of the shuttle, and in most ways the Buran was actually better than the American orbiter
It wasn't that they made them for shits and giggles though, the program was just getting to the end of the testing phase when the Soviet Union started to collapse and the money for the space program dried up for a while
The Buran orbiters were stuck into hangars and left there so they could be pulled out later if they were needed, but the hangars were poorly maintained and the roof started leaking, and when they sent a crew up to do repairs the whole roof collapsed destroying both orbiters and killing some of the workers
Australia's is 000
I think that's a tad easier
*Heatwave*
To be honest, every city is bad in it’s own way, ugly or not
For example, Paris smells like urine
What the fuck did WE do
I'm insulted
How about we show that bald, frosty cunt how to throw a REAL boomerang
Woo hay
We made the list too
Australia
What did we do
Fuck yeah we made it on the list
Oh fuck we made it on the list
Yeah how did we manage that
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one
Добре дошли!
I, for one, welcome our new Bulgarian allies
MH17
Also most of us are first or second generation Europeans
My parents watched it growing up and now I have a Eurovision party at my house every year
Yeah
pretty sure that's racism bud
Anyone else understand what's going on simply from Europa universalis 4
Yep, colloquial or slang
Ah for fuck's sake
I would watch the shit out of that
How the hell is yugoslavia not part of EU but every damn country around it is
day* at least for Belgium
European geography is definitely the most interesting imo
I'm an Aussie who knows about this from [Viggo Mortensen on the Late Late Show with James Corden] He got a few details slightly wrong, but fair play
watch this, it's how I learned about it
Actually I was watching tv
Wait
27 is a heat wave
I think Spain won
Won what
I dont know
Won in which competition
I dont know
But Spain won, they won big
Why don't people ever try to smash this sort of patriarchy
How does an uncomfortable path dissuade people from stealing the stones
Why is central Anatolia and all of the Middle East desert
My great grandfather fought with the South African army in North Africa in WW2
He was behind enemy lines and stole the uniforms off two German soldiers as a disguise
My dad would play a war game in the backyard as a kid, and when he was the bad guy he would don a full Nazi uniform
Some cousin took it though and we haven’t seen it since
Looks like the Egyptian coat of arms
Does UXO count as paraphernalia

I'm Australian and I grew up on Asterix, I fucking loved these books
Asterix, Tintin and Biggles were staples of my childhood here in Australia
'Strayan reporting, I *fucking love* Asterix
It isn't exactly what you would call a national treasure, but I like those books at least :>
I liked Getafix best
Read them in Aus, thought they were popular everywhere
Same as Tintin
...There was a cartoon
Australia here same here
Although practically one knows about Lucky Luke
Also looks a lot like religiosity
Hey me too
No one likes a downer, but if everyone is a downer then it probably doesn't matter
Probably because you export less
German beer is everywhere after all
Kalingrad looks like an outlier but we know it isn't.
Did they count the recent one in Crimea as Russia or Ukraine on this map
Crimea is looking good on this map
Where babby go to
Laughs is Australian
Jokes aside this fucking sucks, yes we get this every year but we're totally use to it, most of us have air-con & we're climatised to it
When I was growing up we didn't have air-con at home or school and we used to wear a wet tea cloth around our necks & I used to sleep on a wrung out wet towel
You'd be surprised how much that can help
Rookie numbers
Laughs in Australian
I've posted this elsewhere but it really does help so I though I'd share:
Aussie here with some survival tips, we didn't have air-con growing up and sometimes nights would be in the low 30s. I used to sleep on a wet towel that had been wrung out, also used to wear a wrung out tea towel around my neck
You'd be surprised how much this can help
I worked in a cafe with shit air-con (in summer it was hotter inside even on days that were over 40), our uniform had a beret
We used to wet them and wear them, it kept us heaps cooler
Good luck
If your work doesn’t have A/C just go home
No job is worth that

We have a high limit at my company
Once it gets about 40 we stop and have a water / ice cream break once an hour (work pays for it no problems) around 45 we stop work completely
Although years ago I worked on a 45 day, in a manufacturing plant (which was much hotter) with full head to toe clothing, face mask and rubber boots/gloves/ apron
That was crazy
I remember walking outside in the sun thinking how nice and cool it was
I'm in Australia too, I wish we had breaks every hour
Apparently they are all over the place
Unfortunately no-one knows where

According to Americans, government investing money in education/healthcare/infrastructure = socialism
What bullshit, Christopher Columbus discovery was far more important, it permanently established communication between the Americas and Europe and started the mass colonization that would occur
Saying Christopher Columbus committed genocide is ridiculous, while he did spread the diseases that would end up killing more then 90% of the American population its not like he knew it would happen, it was completely accidental and would have inevitably occurred whenever the Americas finally established contact with the rest of the world
People always give him shit over initially thinking he was in India (btw when he says India he means the indies, so he thought was in Indonesia or somewhere near it), it was a perfectly reasonable conclusion to make given the circumstances and he did eventually realize he was in a new land (though he thought it southeast-ish of Asia)
i am not sure what you mean by begging
do you mean when he was asking for funding
because that's an odd name for it
Fact is that Christopher Columbus gets way too much shit and is someone people use as a target, its almost like real life is complicated
This is fake news
I am going to post what i said in another comment
From ["Letter of Columbus to the Nurse of Prince John"] page 378
>"A hundred castellanos are as easily obtained for a woman as for a farm, and it is very general, and there are plenty of dealers who go about looking for girls; those from nine to ten are now in demand, and for all ages a good price must be paid
>"I assert that the violence of the calamity of turbulent persons has injured me more than my services have profited me; which is a bad example for the future
>I take it my oath that a number of men have gone to the Indies who did not deserve water in the sight of God and of all the world; and now they are returning thither, and leave is granted them
He speaks against the slavery of young girls and punished those who committed these acts with mutilation and death
>Bobadilla was immediately met with complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolomeo, and Diego
Bobadilla reported to Spain that Columbus regularly used torture and mutilation to govern Hispaniola
>Because of their gross misgovernance, Columbus and his brothers were arrested and imprisoned upon their return to Spain from the third voyage
The gross misgovernace was because Columbus had failed to extract enough gold and because of complaints of fellow Spaniards
They were complaining about the mutilation of there fellow colonists
The natives were also mutilated for various crimes but they didn't care about them, the tyranny they were talking about was his treatment of his fellow Spaniards
I don't deny that Columbus brutally mutilated and killed many people, both native and Spaniard alike
I do however deny the notion that he was anymore brutal than other Spaniards, many of who complained about his defense of natives rights
Consider that future governors were the ones responsible for the elimination of the natives
42 years of governors after Columbus brought the native population down from 200,000 to 201 (of course around 90% of these people would have died from disease but that still leaves 20,000)
Holy shit lol I remember chilling in front of this building from this company and they sent out security because they thought I was being suspicious
I always thought that was so weird and it just hit me what company it was, I thought it was just some typical business but it was their R&D
If I get to call myself a “Waffenhandler” then count me in
As someone who is half Maltese
Yay
Malta
Reminds me of this opera song
["O mio babbino caro"]
>No other EU country has English as an official language however
TIL Malta is not an EU country /s
The rumours are true btw ;)
5% is a very believable number given the fuckwits that win elections by slim margins in countries all around the world
They are:
In Australia, lived at multiple adresses in 5 states
Pay $80 a month now, have never even seen speeds above 1
3mbps in a house I've lived in
Fucking bs
I must be really unlucky, I've lived in apartments in circular quay, brisbane CBD, the Adelaide suburbs and Perth CBD in the past 20 years and never had a location with good internet
Last apartment I lived in was only made in 2005 and it was still max 1
1mbps
Even my mate down the road (same street same suburb) gets almost 40 times my speeds at best (usually around 25x)
It's just bs old cabling
I have had NBN for 8 months here lol
Same at my last house, NBN there for a couple years
Same shitty speeds, doesn't mean a thing when the cables are so old
Contrary to what he said, all Australian eggs I've seen are sold unrefrigerated
In Australia they aren't in fridges in supermarkets, but we keep them in the fridge after purchase
How the fuck is Austria the only country besides the UK with 0% not heard of
How the hell have more than 10% of people not heard of powerhouses such as San Marino, Liechtenstein, Andorra and Belarus
8% not heard of Monaco
How has anyone not heard of Monaco
14% positive North Macedonia
What have they ever done to you
(I've been there
Lovely place and people
Just don't mention Greece
Nah I just talk shit about people all the time
Yeah I agree
The Scandinavian languages are not too hard to learn in writing but the pronunciation is quite hard
Victoria 3 confirmed
Not Macron here, but from what I can find Conte speaks English too
Sure that was the same reasoning that Assange was not extradited too
He isn’t in an EU country
I'm sure /r/vexillology/ would like this
/r/ActuallyItWasDoneOnPurpose
imagine thinking this is summer
Man, in West Australia thats mid winter
I’d hate to be in your version of cold
I'm freaking freezing here in Brisbane at 21c, I want my summer ;(
It's 12° in Melbourne and I'm freezing my arse off
Man I remember camping in Canberra in -3 and fucking freezing like it was the end of the world
That said I’ll wear jeans up through to 30 to 35 in summer
How does it look for foreign language other than English
OMG yeah
Depends on how they poll the population, but that number could be greatly influenced by immigrants lol
I'm guessing that for younger generations in any country the answer will be English
The UK is going to learn its real place in the world come post-Brexit
Leavers will be in for a good reality check though they'll blame everyone else, of course
MEH
British Isles Economic Alliance incoming
Brussels be damned
Haven't lived there in over 15 years, mate, so wouldn't know
DAS REICH IST SEHR SCHLAU
This literally helped me when I was lagging behind in school as a small child; I was allowed to stay awake past my bed time, provided I was reading in bed
Very quickly English became my best subject
Would Australia be able to help since we are experienced in bushfires
Doesn't even have to be neighbours
We here in Australia have a great relationship with California
As our summers are opposite and we both have big bush/wild fire seasons we help each other out with personnel and share water bombing aircraft
Somehow this doesn't apply to Greece
They call at times we rest, like 3-4pm
We have a lunch break from work from 14
00-18
They make sure you've fallen asleep before they call
It’s everyone
Sorry to get real in this sarcasm thread but it’s the fact is not enough people around the entire world gives a shit
I mostly blame the boomers
They don’t care about their children or grand children and only vote for their own self interest
We just had an election in Australia where the conservative party that didn’t even have a climate policy won in a surprise upset basically cause they waved tax breaks in front of people eyes
So all the old farts voted for them
Man I fucking love castles, and there's so many different kinds around Europe to visit, it's something I never get tired of

Jesus fucking christ, you're asking for the suffering of millions
This isn't a breakup with your highschool girlfriend where you "win" by making her friends hate her
You just look like a cunt instead
What you're proposing would have far reaching consequences for decades to come
This isn't an ex-girlfriend where you need to settle a score
Fuck do you lot even pay attention in European history classes
No it isn't, the PM in all Commonwealth countries is just another minister, hence the name: prime minister
Jesus mate you're beyond help
I'm glad you have no real political power
Showing strength to discourage others has been done before
It worked out well for Germany, didn't it
Clearly you paid attention in history
Yeah, and he can be terfed out if the party doesn't like his decisions, something we regularly do
The PM's cabinet is an advisory role, it isn't recognised by the Australian constitution, and neither is the position of PM
Maybe it's different in Britain so I shouldn't have spoke so soon
Aussie here, why do you think we're notorious for constantly changing PM's?
Our government having a weak PM seems like the exception, not the rule
That said, I'd much rather have a bit of instability than give a single person too much power, because that opens the possibility of one madman ruining the country, like in the UK or the US
I've never taken interrail, what's the perks
I've found catching buses through Europe to be super cheap (went from Nantes to Paris for ~20 euro for example), with the freedom to choose when I want to go and how long I want to stay (I tend to travel for 6 months+ when I do)
Curious, thanks
Thanks for the info homie
Maybe I'll try it out next time as I'd have to agree some of the buses can be way longer than they have to be, and the comfort would be nice, thanks
Potatoes are from South America
Well they're not Slavic are they
I associate Mongolian with breaking city walls
Well if polish people made a Christmas tree out of horse you wouldn't call that a Slavic-Mongolian-black sea Christmas tree
Koreans too man
Whenever I said stuff in Korean there they were ecstatic
Cool
I hope you all get a potato today
