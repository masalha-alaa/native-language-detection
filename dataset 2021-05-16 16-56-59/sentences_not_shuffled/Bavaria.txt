It isn't illegal here to escape prison
This law was implemented in the Weimar Republic and then removed in the Nazi times and then again implemented in 1949
Exactly ;)
Albanian is really awesome
Such a unique language
Of course
The best thing
He wasn’t even asked about a wall when he said it
How much can you buy for one god
He was very old and also quite senile
He also told the queen “equal goes it lose” (gleich gehts los)
He wanted to say “It will start shortly”
"it is forbidden because it's illegal" ...just hilarious
Again
I am a firm believer that the future belongs to the railway
Mostly freight
But also passengers
And as such high speed rail is a important part of it
Did you ever have to change trains at München Hbf
2nd highest amount of platforms in the world behind New York grand central
And no footbridge or tunnel
If your train arrives at track 5 and you need to get a connection on track 27 you will walk for ~20 min
Yes
Sleeper trains are also great, but high speed rail still has its advantages
Munich is a terminus
It also has two wing stations which are only accessible by walking the length of the respective side platforms
Never said they were
But for a trip like Berlin to Paris high speed rail would be more practical than overnight trains
Although for longer routes the overnight trains get more attractive
Anything that can be driven within one night
But what would be even better
Overnight high speed rail
Imagine the distances that could be covered while driving 350 km/h in one night
I suppose we are the country with most resentiments against Germany
I can confirm this
I would say it’s more normal to drive to Italy than to the north of Germany
Orangina is actually from Tunesia, not Italy
Esprit was founded in San Francisco and now has it's HQ in Pembroke
But I think much of it belongs to a Hong Konger since long ago and the Hong Kong part of it today is the biggest
Probably depends on which language is closer to you
The name is written exactly the same in both variants
Ganz dünnes Eis birschal
Pretty sure people in the western world consuming Austrian brand Red Bull has been a thing for longer than the same people wearing these shirts
Don’t you use Cyrillic letters
Or did I get this wrong
Yes
They are even speaking Bavarian
We also “kinda” understand you
This is the way
We Bavarians are in the weirdest position between these two
On the one hand we are part of Germany
On the other hand we are culturally closest to Austria
Lecter Approves of this way of marinading
Frohes Neues
East Germany
Especially the smaller towns are dead since all the people fled to the west after the curtain fell
How nice of them that they still included German
I think the Americans thinking Ireland being part of England is right up there
We have speed limits
There are some sections on the Autobahn where there is no speed limit for a few kilometers but even these often get adjusted by these dynamic speed limit light thingys, adjusting for traffic and weather
There are even much longer parts without speed limit
What I wanted to say is, it's not like Autobahn is automatically no speed limit
Start out in East Berlin, first missions in Trabant
After a few missions the prologue ends with fleeing to west Berlin
There you connect with West Berlin criminals
Later there has to be a time where you return for a few missions (maybe helping a buddy/family member cross the border) and Stasi is having it's eye on you this time
Also: Potential to meet Bowie and Iggy Pop (or corresponding characters)
Love it
Good point
Yea Europe map would be nice
But I guess to big
Some missions with a greasy corrupt Austrian Politician doing some shady business
Nice
Why am I thinking about atomic blonde
-Blue Monday starts playing-
Just thinking about how that moment of escaping the bland east  could be staged, arriving in the west and suddenly bluejeans, Coca-Cola, pop music n stuff everywhere
Well I guess they had enough time
I think the psp game with Altaïr is set in either Malta or Cyprus
I can’t really remember
We waived any legal claims with the final peace treaties before reunification in 1990
It was required for the allies to allow reunification and end of occupation
We signed a treaty saying we don’t have a claim to it
Switzerland has a rather high cost of living
If you would go to a country with a lower cost of living, you have more money to spend on things you enjoy
The old forms of english are more similar to german than the current spoken english

An Bavarian AA member
Everyone who's not from Bavaria
Not all Germans wear Lederhosen
We have a beer festival where annually millions of tourists come to waste their money
That's an old joke from GDR army people
"If we decide to attack on Friday evening, we can march right past all the checkpoints into West Berlin
Only problem is I don't know how to get my soldiers past the shops and warehouses
9€ per Maß? You're funny
It's 11,75€!
Yep, I live in Munich
I actually go there a few times per year (not only Oktoberfest, also Frühlingsfest etc
I'm a big fan of Bavarian traditions and Lederhosn and this whole stuff ;)
The Eifel Tower
Not saying it’s terrible it’s just not that special imo
Yea perfect in the middle
Well the intention for WW1 wasn’t to conquer Europe
Someone killed somebody and another one got mad about that
The second one belongs to us
Do you even bbq
Kaswurscht4life
Not that much conflict about "Berliner" and "Krapfen". More about "Pfannkuchen" and "any other word for sth that clearly is not a Pfannkuchen/pancake"
There is no thing that can be done right in Berlin and surroundings
It's like it's cursed
Hasn't been made in a pan for about a 100 years
In Bavaria I’ve never seen a private German flag
(Except for sport events) But it’s kinda normal to have a [Bavarian] flag
There aren’t so many but I guess in some villages and small cities there is one person who has one hanging in the front
For example my uncle has some variants of it
With a club symbol or even with our last king on the flag
In my village I know 2 Bavarian flags and one Italian flag
Outside of football
Yes
But in Bavaria it is really common to see Bavarian flags
Why are you right if you have a Greek flag
In Bavaria farmers often buy fertilizer etc
in Zentner’s
I also heard of some parents from Berlin who wanted to call their son 'Pikachu'. Of course, the state didn't allow it
Their reason for the denial was "Pikachu doesn't identify the child with a specific gender".
Now the kid's name is "Pikachu Kevin".
English, because usually the community is mainly English-speaking and it helps not having to look up translations for certain things if you have a question
And guides are usually betztr in English too and I'm having problems following them when it's in English but my game in German
Here I am
Depends on your viewpoint though
I totally agree with you
But I was simply making a little joke
Austrians coming to my town keep usually speaking their native accent since (at least where I live) the dialect is similar to most of the Austrian ones
But it sounds very odd if a nothern German tries to adapt to the Bavarian dialect
It's better to keep your own accent
In that way it sounds more natural
Mia schliaßa uns o. Mid de fischkepf wirds a gfreid
Correct
It's easier to understand someone from Salzburg than someone from Hamburg
Also the all mighty “Servus”
It is a crime to use the symbols of forbidden organizations(NSDAP, SS, etc
) if it is not in an artistic way
So in a movie set in the third Reich the actors can wear the party uniform

Well in Switzerland it’s nearly the same although it’s a country
(Except the laws)
In East Germany it was quite popular to call their children "Randy" but spelled it "Rändi"
I believe that’s the case in Germany, isn’t it
Merkel was born in eastern Germany - a separate country at the time
Isn’t **everything** Soros fault at that point
Maybe Spiegel
Or was that only a Franz Joseph Strauß thing
Hitler profited from burning down the parliament building
Orban has a fucking pandemic to his disposal
It was a homage to a scandal from the 60s. Franz Joseph Strauß, back then Minister of defense, had the Spiegel headquarters raided by police and a couple of journalists jailed
Officially because they ran an article stating according to a governmental study that the German army was only partly ready for defense
They claimed they unveiled top secret information and thus committed treason
In reality it was because Der Spiegel was not particularly friendly to Strauß and criticized him often
It drew a huge outcry of criticism because it was not only really illegal but also in violation of the German constitution
In the end it led to Strauß’s firing from the position of minister of defense
BER is a pretty big joke here
Its been going on for a while theres some really funny satire about it
I'm from Bavaria
Very popular

In England
Everything is correct bro
You’re a legend
Why
I know many people who can speak just barely their other language
From where comes your mom
It seems to me that you can understand Bavarian quite good
Even 100% Germans can’t always understand it
That’s why I’m so impressed
Yea that conversation was in Bavarian that’s why I’m impressed
Haha
It’s very good
For the first time in well, ever we really work together as friends and partners
We are all a big family
There may sometimes be arguments
In what families there is none
But that’s not a big problem
We currently have the longest period of peace in Europe that we ever had
That wouldn’t be possible without the EU
Also it’s great that you can just go and live, work or study everywhere you want
From Finland to Portugal
All in all it’s great
My grandfather had to go to the HJ (Hitler youth organisation)
He was expelled due to too "communistic opinions" (he is a democrat and votes for the middle-to-right-wing party CSU)
Then he had to go to the army where he was imprisioned by the French when he was 18
He was able to flee
He still lives and he's now 91
I didn't elaborate well, sorry for that
He was imprisioned *in* France, not by the French ;)
We have five official languages in Germany
German, Danish, Sorbic, Firsian and Romani
Have not seen anyone do that except for maybe kids
On Oktoberfest, we didn't find a table so we asked a few girls if we could be with them the evening
We were having pretty good conversations until I asked them where they're from
They said they're living in Munich
I asked them in German "you're kidding
" We all had to live because we talked around an hour in English without realising we're all from Munich
It turned out one of the girls even lives in the same street as I do
And that's really uncommon
Munich is a big city and the propability to meet someone on the very international Oktoberfest who lives in the same street is rather unlikely
We had a good evening with them, was really funny :)
Every minor town in East Germany
Saures Lüngerl
This is literally veal lung
It gets cooked together with vinegar
It is like a thick soup with lung pieces in it
I personally think it’s delicious
Others think it’s disgusting
In the Allgäu, there is a specialty which is essentially baked cow udder
Watch it on television
Well theres the tale of the chapel in the ebersberger forest
Its a small white chapel that sits right beside a country road which goes through the forest
Its said that many years ago a woman and her child got run over right next to the chapel and the driver fled, now when you drive past the chapel at night she might stand there in a white dress and raise her hand ( as in hitchhiking)
The legend says you have to take her with you, if you refuse to she will show up in your car, block your steering and brakes and run you into a tree
Honestly the chapel alone is kinda creepy already and that story does not make it better
Only my dialect has a few
For example:
"I" for "I"
"a" for "too"
We say "An Opfl". Doesn't matter, you're right
"Too" is written "aa" and "a" is written "a"
This wasn't Bavarian
Scheich dich du Saupreiß. I dad a wort ratschn mit dia
This is Bavarian
Correct :)
My mistake again
You're right :)
Outside of school two things
English YouTube
And only being able to speak English with my dads friends
We started learning in third grade, but only the basics, and 99% of my English I've learned from games and being on English-speaking sites like reddit
I've never actively tried to improve my English, it just came with time
Thank god English is a relatively easy language
Buy your meat and eggs and maybe dairy products from local farmers or butchers
It will cost more, but it is way more environmentally friendly
And the cost is a incentive to eat less meat
Also
It tastes better than the stuff from the supermarket
As you said, Hitler
But tbf, Hitler lived nearby the German border
That’s a fairly similar sentiment as in Germany
Most Germans did not know(or did not care to much), what would happen, in 1933
Later a big part was opportunism
If for example you are a teacher
You would have nearly guaranteed joined the nazi party and the nazi teacher federation
Not because you were a nazi, but because you wanted to keep your job
Letzte Nocht
Generally all of Falco, a lot of the “neue deutsche Welle” stuff and for my own personal sake the “Erste Allgemeine Verunsicherung”
The description made me think of [Go on home British Soldiers]
Fata Morgana is one of my all time favorites
I love Fuerstenfeld
Sometimes the intro almost makes me cry
Great vocal harmony going on
They sure knew what they did with that one
We say "Merci" and "Servus". But in the rest of Germany and in our cities nobody thanks the driver
Upper Palatinate (yes, it is part of Bavaria)
They speak an odd dialect and live on their own silently so that everyone forgets about them
Also Swabia (yes, we also hava a part of Swabia in Bavaria)
They speak the weirdest German in the world ;)

We learn them both
First the printed version
Then cursive
Later it is up to the student himself to find his style
Most have some form of mixture between both
jesus fucking christ
someone please invade Saxony
Wrong
We dislike Austrians as well as Prussians
You talking about Austria or Bavaria
BC either way you're right, biggest parts of both are flat
More arrogant than Austrians
Have you ever been to Vienna
The elegance with which even a viennese drunk bum can blow out his arrogance makes Berlin hipsters go green with envy
Love it
Czechia
We call it "Tschechien". It's way shorter than "Tschechische Republik"
I think it would constitute as treason if I didn’t say the [flag of Bavaria]
At one point we had the APPD
Anarchistische Pogo-Partei Deutschland
Their goals (copy paste):
-Right to unemployment with full salary
-Youth pension instead of retirement pension
-Abolishment of compulsory education
-Creation of centers for physical love, so-called Mitfickzentralen (literally "fuckpooling centers")
-Abolition of police
-Legalization of all drugs
-Abolition of the right to demonstrate with prior announcement (abolition of distinction between permitted and not permitted)
-Totale Rückverdummung ("total restupidification") and balkanization of Germany
-Reconstitute the German borders from 1237 (a satire on the aim of some German extreme-right parties to restore the German borders during the time of Nazism and World War II - or World War I)
While this is more on the satire side of things like "Die Partei" is today, we have freaks like "Die Bayernpartei" that aim for Bavaria to leave Germany and become a country of it's own
And they truly believe in it
Truth is, that would suck for everyone, no matter what conservative Bavarians or "bavariaphobic" fishheads want to believe
I had a school trip when I was 6 and the older children told me about sex
I was absolutely shocked
They get burned there i heard
Imagine invading Wales
You can’t command your troops because no one can pronounce their location as well as the target

How similar is afrikaans to Dutch for a native speaker
In this case we don’t necessarily want to be associated with our brethren’s north of the “weißwuaschd meridian”
In parts
Yeah, that's totally true
Also, there are some Franconian people who want Franconia to leave Bavaria and be a seperate state
My profs just make videos and upload them onto the uni's platform
The Grand Tour did a little tour of such places in Germany and Austria
Namely Wank, Kissing, Petting, Fucking, Wedding
Lederhose in East Germany
Everything from 33 to 45
Hindenburg's decision to announce Hitler as new Reichkanzler (Chancellor of the Reich) lead to lots of innocent deaths and the deadliest war of all time
To me as a German/Bavarian it's whatever the Viennese, including their bums, speak when they insult me
I'm not saying it's "Viennese" bc someone told me almost no one would still speak that today and what you are hearing in Vienna would just be some bastard dialect
Anyway, they will call you the most disgusting things but with such an effortless elegant arrogance, it will make anyone in Berlin go pale with envy
I think it's not even the words they use but just the way they say it
They can say the most stupid things but it will sound like a dance
And they can't not dance
To me everything will sound like that, if they want it or not and most of the time they will look for every occasion to insult you (even if just mildly) anyway
It's like someone doing backflips to go to the toilet or juggling while fucking or solving a rubiks cube while shooting up heroin
Just a small effortless exercise in arrogance and making everyone feel that you are annoyed by their existence
I'm in love with it but after a few days in Vienna it always gets a bit much and I'm relieved to be back in Bavaria where people will just sound like the degenerate mountain men they are and not honk at every German license plate they see, only at Munich license plates
I personally have never seen one but there are some stores which have foreign food (polish of course too)
I know some Russian stores but no polish one or I didn’t see that it is polish ^ ^
From a Bavarian point of view
Other Germans will gladly complete this with their unrestrained opinion about Bavaria :P
**Berlin** - Huge
Dirty
Lazy hipster smartasses
**Lower Saxony** - Best Saxony
Actually we don't know shit about it other than that it's pretty flat and bc of that not a candidate for Bavarian annexion
**Baden-Württemberg** - Hard working and just as rich as we are but stingy
They have dialects that even a Bavarian deems worthy of the word "extraordinary".
**Rhineland-Palatinate** - Wine
Some parts might get confused with NRW or Hesse
**Saxony** - Nazis everywhere
Leipzig is a proud exception and I love them for it
They have some of the poorest regions in Germany and it's probably the reason why they are so angry and also why some of them came here and "took er jerbs
" They are welcome as long as they behave
**Thuringia** - Also a lot of Nazis but not as many as in Saxony
Good Bratwurst
Nice landscapes, even Bavaria has to admit that
**Hessen** - "Äpplwoi" and "Handkäs". You love those or you hate those
Their capital is worthy of the word "capital". As in "capitalism".
**North Rhine-Westphalia** - Looks like a damn shithole
But you have to be there to see that it's more than that
This is the westiest west Germany has to west
Small beer glasses but just take 3 or 5 of them at once and you're fine
But be aware, some of their beer is like piss and some is like gods piss
This is the place in Germany where If feel like I am judged the least about where I am from, how I talk, how I look or whatever
**Saxony-Anhalt** - Pretty similar to Saxony
Just like their southern brothers they are pretty afraid of foreigners bc they have never seen one before
**Brandenburg** - Here you can feel the Prussian heritage the strongest and that kind of makes them our nemesis
**Mecklenburg-Vorpommern** - Where East-Germans liked to go for vacations and I think they still like it
**Hamburg** - The most true leftist and alternative place in DE
Where some in Berlin act like it bc style and that's a modern hipster thing to do, in Hamburg they just live it
**Schleswig-Holstein** - Wacken
Also everyday when I go take a shit, the thing I flush down when I'm done is bigger than their biggest mountain
**Saarland** - How come this is not France and Alsace is
TV tells me incest would be a stereotype applicable here but tbh I never heard about this stereotype in real life
**Bremen** - They speak the cleanest German
And that's about it
edit: uh, I think I somehow got that confused with Hannover
However that happened
So now I have zero stereotypes left for Bremen
**Bavaria** - Gods holy land and a nation made of the direct descendents of Jesus and his royal highness King Ludwig themselves
They are of majestic beauty, speaking in sacred tongues only understood by those God deemed worthy
Generous, intelligent (just bc you don't speak our sacred tongue does not mean it's not smart things that we have to say) and hard-working
Everybody loves us in all of Germany and all over the world
It's true
We have the best beer and the best food, at the very latest since we acquired a new Franconia that now graces our large inventory of smaller countries that sometimes try to defy our warm godly embrace but in the end know that their place is by our side and thus by the side of all that is right and good in this world
This is where God and everyone else in Germany comes to dine and for vacation and spends abnormous amounts to have a small piece of our country
And then we are unkind and condescending to them bc that is what the Lord told us to do
Amen
edit:
Also, even if I am not an Austrian, I want to say a thing about
**Vienna** - The amount of love they have for themselves (as in "a single Viennese has for himself", not for his community), the amount of cool and casual unfriendlyness and arrogance and hate for everyone but especially everything further away than Vienna Woods is bigger than everything I have ever seen before
If Berliners would know about anything outside of Berlin they would die of envy bc the Viennese arrogance and unkindness not only rivals theirs, it surpasses the "Berliner Schnauze" and the Berlin arrogance by a lot
I love it
Even their bums can spit their hate for you being German in your face with such effortless elegance, it's astounding
Being yelled or honked at for being German is a must for every vacation in Vienna
Put that on your list if you're planning to visit
Yes
That also does not make anything I said less true
Oh damn, you're right about that
I should have known better
Well, it's Bavarian arrogance I guess
What
There is no such place
Lies
Dirty lies
Yeah CSU frightens me too
ahem I mean "I am overawed by our lords ambassadors"
^^^send ^^^help
Back then it was Bavaria, today it's Rhineland-Palatinate
One of those pesky, unruly small additions to our estate that escaped our warm embrace
But yes, I had Trumps arrogance in mind when I wrote that, thought it would be funny
Bavarian arrogance is sometimes pretty bad but not Trump bad
Nonono, that can not be
We are the chosen ones
Yeah I did that Badenser mistake before
*staring angrily over the garden fence and clenching my fist*
There is no country in this world where there is no nationalistic groups
How could you not agree
> But tbf Saxony is the economically strongest region in east Germany
Not per capita
But that is Berlin so maybe a bit unfair
Yeah it's a lot of beer
But, recently I read that Czech and Austrians would drink even more and couldn't believe it
Then I was in Vienna for the first time in a long time, a few weeks ago
Holy shit they drink a lot of beer everywhere and every time of the day
And it's all cans
Palatinate can have the Trump blame then, for what I care
At the same time they and FW are ranting about the greens for it
I'm longing for a time when Bavaria won't be governed by some random grandpas and countryside shitkickers
We have a ski resort consisting of two mountains, the Waldkopf (= Forest Mountain) and the Sudelfeldkopf (= Sudelfeld Mountain, Sudelfeld doesn't mean anything relevant)
The Waldkopf has no trees while the Sudelfeldkopf has a forest (= Wald) on it
Even 20°C are warm here
We only have this in the highest summer from June to August
Currently we have about 0°C which is rather cold but it's gonna get even colder until I consider 0°C as warm
We have up to -20°C around here
(I live in Bavaria in the Alps)
I live in Munich
Only time i got in trouble was when i walked across a red light with a police officer on the other side of the street
Didnt even get a fine or anything
And i havent heard of anyone getting in trouble for crossing an empty road yet
Hey
I was born in Munich and raised 60km away
The only thing I would do at Oktoberfest is to play some games
And even that’s overpriced to hell
For the price of one liter of beer at Oktoberfest you can get a whole six pack elsewhere
Or even a “tragerl” if you are not to picky
Why should I go there for overpriced beer, way to crowded spaces and wasted Australians barfing on the little hill behind the tents and passing out
I could imagine to spend my time more cheaply and more fun
And not having to see and smell humanities buttcrack while doing so
Herrenchiemsee
The unfinished Versailles of the same guy who build Neuschwanstein
To get there you’ll get to have a lovely boat ride
Edit: you can also rent a electric boat afterwards and have fun on the water
Also
You can reach it nicely by train to prien
In Germany we do "Aristarchos" which would be similar to your swedish example of "Epikuros" instead of Epikouros since it's still pronounced "Aristarkos". So you're not alone with that, I guess
It happens though in later history
Someone mentioned Cristoforo Colombo who we call Christoph Kolumbus in German
Well, technically Austria didn't exist during WW2
But I agree regarding WW1
Well, it's not like Austria or Austrian politicians had any kind of influence after the Anschluss
Austria's territory only helped for a better strategic position
Decisions were still made by Hitler and his government in Berlin
Austria surely did it's part, but it's not comparable with Germany's role in WW2 at all
We would be occupied
Germany was occupied by the French in the coalition wars and then freed itself in 1815
Then it lost WWI and became a democracy which was abused by a certain Austrian man with ugly mustache
From 1945 to 1949 Germany was occupied by France, the UK and US and the USSR
from 1949 to the early 1990s Germany was partly-sovereign
Paris
Nothing wrong with the city, it’s just overrated
Yeah favoriten and fünfhaus are the exact opposites of posh haha
Yeah I agree
I live in Munich
But also, I think if you know the right spots and people, night life can be pretty nice
Im by no means an expert but id say ottakring is ok
It has a significant yugoslavian population and yugo party scene
But id say despite the party scene which usually is more of an indicator for a crappy area, ottakring is decent
Better than favoriten and fünfhaus
Then again ottakring borders fünfhaus so if he lives at the border its probably bad
Id say as long as you dont live near the clubs and bars and the border to fünfhaus youre fine
It depends on your age i'd say
For my age the English Garden and the Isar are some really nice spots to party and hang out
No, I didn't hear anything in the news
Even when I google it I can't find anything
I doubt that
European monarchs barely have power anymore, this includes forming a new country just because of marriage
Any reason why you specifically picked Austria as an example
Sure, I just thought there was a story behind it
Or is Austria famous for having many local brewers in Denmark
Yes I would
But I think there has to be some restrictions for it
I would say that EU/EEA citizens who had their primary residence here for a while should be able to vote in the country they live in
The time is debatable
I would say maybe 5 or 10 years
Edit: I have much bigger problems with people voting in a countries election they don’t live in
They don’t have to bear the consequences
For example we have many Turkish citizens in Germany that vote for erdogan to take away liberties and human rights
But they don’t have to give up those liberties and rights because they live in Germany
What borders
The Hitlerputsch
1923 Hitler started a run with his followers through Munich
The intention was to plunder the weapon chamber of Munich and then run to Berlin to take over Germany
This didn't work and he was brought into jail for a year or so
Not in the Sense you are Talking about
But the state of Bavaria was Adolph Hitlers sole heir
His personal flat in now a police department
They also held the rights to „Mein Kampf“ until the copyright expired recently
That’s why they could prevent distribution in other countries for decades
Upper Franconia, Middle Franconia, Lower Franconia
Well tbf berlin is very cheap for a major european capital
Even compared to other german cities its cheap
What's that
Holy shit
In Germany (at least where I live) everyone can be friends with everyone
We had a cooking projevt in which every class cooked one week per year for every other class
[Link]
But tbh it was more of a 'learn to cut potatoes' than a 'learn to cook' project
25 minute car ride or about an hour with public transport, if there aren't any problems with that
I used to defend our public transport and if it reliably only took an hour I would still take it but it already cost me so much more lifetime and almost exactly the same money than going by car
In winter every week there is at least one train delayed so it might take up to 2 hours one way
Sometimes it really depressed me how much time I lost sitting on that stupid train not moving for half an hour when I should already have been at home for 10 minutes
So now I'm guilty of using the car, widening my environmental footprint but being already at home when the train just left the place where I work
I get up at the time I automatically wake up
I check if any interesting lectures happen at university
If there are interesting lectures:
I check if I have other plans, if not, I make me a coffee, shower myself and go there
If there aren't any interesting lectures:
I stay in bed and browse reddit
I went to Arizona and when I drove into a town they had a sign telling the visitors what kind of stores there are
On the bottom of that sign was written "Wir haben eine Backerei" (We have a bakery) in German
I have no idea why and I wasn't able to find this bakery
Also I went to Spain and tgere was "Schorschs Bierstubn" which is the Bavarian expression of a restaurant where you can drink beer
Schorsch is the Bavarian form for George
The houses I grew up in in Bavaria where all heated with woodstoves and I remember cutting up wood and stacking it around the house in the late summer and fall
One house we had for rent even "came with" a small plot of land on a nearby mountain to cut trees for that, since there is no such thing as "cutting firewood on public land" in Germany
There is licences needed and stuff
Most people that heat with firewood buy it already cut or in whole trees from rangers/the woodworkers the rangers employ or people that own bigger plots of land in the woods
The house I'm living in right now is heated primarily by oil furnaces in each of the flats
It's pretty old and that is not common at all in Germany
My neighbour below has both, an oil furnace and woodstove
In newer houses woodstoves are more a luxury item additional to central heating
People like the look of it and the smell of the burning wood (me too)
BJÖRN
MEIN NAME IST BJÖRN HÖCKE
That actually happened nearby where I live
I was really shocked
Can relate, I've been living in Munich for nine years
I hate: Being called a Nazi
I love: Being associated with Lederhosen and beer
Oarchkatzlschwoaf
It's Bavarian for the tail of a squirrel
Well we're the country of board games
So while there is of course
stuff like "Nine men's morris" (Mühle), Backgammon, Checkers
that people know almost everywhere,
we also invented the "Mensch ärgere dich nicht" variant of cross and circle games and a lot of modern classics like Catan and Carcassonne
And I think most Germans have at least seen these
In the international board game community German board games are still known for quality up until today
Especially among fans of low randomness, trading and worker placement mechanics and high attention on a setting interwoven with the game mechanics
The German "Spiel des Jahres" award for board games is recognized as a seal of quality, much to my delight hearing non-Germans trying to pronounce "Spiel des Jahres".
So maybe we're not that strong on cultilvating a board game tradition with very old games, but probably we are one of the strongest "players" of modern board gaming
Österreich-Ungarn
The Swedish invasion of Bavaria ain’t bad either
And you bloody bastards never crossed the river Inn
Dammn right neighbor
Inglourious Basterds
Corelahmee
We have officially:
German, Sorbic, Frisian, Danish and Romanes
Unofficially there's spoken a Dutch-similar-sounding German dialect "Plattdeutsch".
There are a lot more dialects whose speakers sometimes can't be understood by people from other regions
The dialect on the other side of the river can be completely different than your's.
In the Hesse constitution death penalty is still allowed
It can't be used though because federal law of Germany breaks states' law
I finished school this year and I did arab spring and Germany's reunion
Maybe depends on the German state you're finishing school in
For menit was Bavaria
I was told that Bavaria has the highest level of all a levels in Germany
Babelsberg (near Berlin)
Bavaria Filmstudios (near Munich)
And Henry is Heinrich
East Germany is way more beautiful than everyone thinks
I went there (Saxony/Berlin) a few years ago for the first time and I was surprised how beautiful the old cities (as Dresden, Leipzig etc) are
Of course, because of the lots of people who flew after the border was opened, the smaller towns are rather empty and neglected
The nature is wonderful anyways
It depends
Generally it’s higher than in Eastern Europe
But there are tricks
First of, for regional trains almost every Bundesland has so called “Ländertickets”. They allow you to take every regional train in this Bundesland on this day
And most of the time busses, trams and U-Bahn are included
There is also such a ticket available for the whole of Germany, but in those the city traffic may not be included
For long distance trains you should buy in advance
There you can get quite cheap tickets
But those cheap tickets are limited to one specific train
Never buy on the day you want to travel
Also you could think about a BahnCard
This is a discount for tickets for 25% or 50%. If you plan to travel often by train, those can really be worth it
You have to inform yourself about the quirks and tricks to get the best prices, or else you pay more than you would need to
No, we tried that once
Didn't go too well
Also in Germany
Germany and Bavaria
None of them agree with that but it's true
Edit: I know Bavaria is part of the Federal Republic
This is actually so accurate lmao
We Germans love sausages haha
Ju dit vorgett se “se”. Sis is unaxeptabel

[Sooo cute]
Or simply our LoFi girl…
There's no actual danger, I hope
>	when everyone just sees her as „the pretty one“
That’s the same problem Merkel has to face till today
People often underestimate her cause she is so pretty…
Nope
We Germans are still the only ones with the right to start a WW
oh my fucking god
i got bamboozled
Look close to his face
He doesn’t look really older
>	he could be presiding over legislation that waters down environmental protection
WTF
He is from the Green Party
Stop spreading theoretical fake news
It’s always you Brits…
~~Yeah, but he is now under the main influence of Green/EFA
That’s his european party family
I meant with that that you’ve smeared him theoretically to make your point
As a result, many here will read this and unconsciously store your theoretical devaluation in the brain, although this is not true at all
Hey, we are usually only racist against Prussians
Tbf, a lot of people here got angry when the Greeks pictured Merkel as Hitler
>	where religion and race are synonymous
WTF
There is no Jewish race
My grandparents were convinced that this would be a thing
We all know the outcome
[Well]
So you mean… Germany… above everything else
Most of the EU polls are saying that we should kick out the UK…
The UK would veto a EU army
I am very happy that they are leaving - most of the EU leaders are
From the money perspective: Germany alone could have paid the British fees five times last year with its surplus
No one will miss their money, especially not Germany
We will
France already announced that there is no chance for the UK to stay in the EU…
Bozen exists
Valetta is also very nice
I like these „castle cities“.
Yeah, that is nice, too
However, most things were closed when we there
Also the church is really nice
And i am really ashamed that we Germans throw a bomb right in it
That’s absolutely disgusting
Ja, aus München

I would have liked a picture with no dress

Also the major is a little bit crazy
This sounds like a title from a satire news site
Haha
It’s this guy Martin Sonneborn is always talking about
He was his neighbour in the European Parliament…
He is famous in Germany, cause he is so absurd
Hey, nearly no other nation votes that sarcastically for the European Parliament as we Germans
Don’t forget that
It’s a serious election for the other nations…
I would never vote for them, too
But they are funny
They are punching up, look alone [here] I like them very much, but I am a member of another party
But they are doing a good job
Yeah, their graphic designer should be fired
They have a lot of stupid graphics for [this otherwise interesting survey]
Well, good
They should, fuck that
Well, it’s her birthday
So she is allowed
Well, it’s her birthday…
[Germany’s EU presidency]
Na, we don’t do that anymore…
Just the normal German [Möbius Strip]
I thought all regions of Schleswig-Holstein can also vote in the German federal elections
I mean, in Germany the influence of the AfD is nowadays lower than three years ago
Look alone the 180° change the CSU has made in the last two years…
Foreigners are often [a little bit confused] :)
>	imagine people are gathering for 64 days and wanting your resignation
Some people in east Germany demanding Merkel’s resignation since 2015 every day
Protests alone don’t legitimate claims
My little sisters school here in Munich changed the timetable so they will not miss school during those protests on Fridays
I've read somewhere that over 200k students all over Germany were protesting, could that be about right
Awesome
Wish I could have been there too
What's with the line on Russias Western border
Makes me feel ashamed of living in Germany
This kind of behavior is disgusting and cowardly
Violence against people using Nazi symbols is no different from other political violence
It shouldn't be a "very bad idea". I'm ashamed of being a German when it is actually dangerous to do any kind of salute here
Apparently we still have a long way to catch up in liberalism
Me, too
This was a disheartening thread to read
If those are Europeans, I don't want to be one anymore
They are part of the green group - at least in the European Parliament
Aren’t you guys the only east european country with a significant Green Party (the Pirates)
They are green
Grey doesn’t have many seats here…
Part of the European green group since years…
Christian Party was the most voted in the european election
Ah come on
Even east Germany is East Europe
^(We see you guys as the Bavarians of east Europe
We really like you
Why don’t you change your voting system
It’s ridiculous
Yeah, sorry
Here in Germany the EPP party (Merkel and von der Leyen) is called „Christian Democratic Union“. And their counterpart here in Bavaria is called „Christian Social Union“.
But they should change their name
Many Christians like nuns and priests voted currently for the Green Party and demonstrated against the conservatives
Everyone got firstname lastname and biden is just there like "hello im President"
vdL attended a meeting of the 16 German state prime ministers last Friday
Merkel is also often there
You can bring guests to such meetings, why not
Merkel even [attended a (fancy) meeting of the Bavarian Government last year] Unusual, of course
But if another head of state would like to attend a meeting there, what are the points against this
It’s normal for German governments, federal or state, to invite leaders of other governments to their meetings
I am very sure this was an idea from Merkel or vdL
(Usually it’s really boring for the foreign leaders to be there
They don’t care about 95% of the issues
But it’s a German Tradition
Germany has opposed the Iraq war
Also stayed neutral during the Libyan war
Tbf, it was a bit funny
Im glad the US has now a leader where we can make harmless jokes about him like this
The last years have been a complete shitshow
Back then, when the CSU was more to the right, even Orban has attended once a meeting of the Bavarian government
At least in Germany this is not that unusual to do
Maybe it was the idea of Merkel or vdL ^((BTW: it’s always a lower case „v“. „von“ is always lower case in German)
The EU is a … ~~German~~ ~~Austrian~~ French (thanks god) idea
The intro of the German army podcast I’m listening to starts with the line of our former green foreign minister: „I’m not convinced“. That was back then at the Munich Security Conference to the US defence minister
It’s a powerful quote in my opinion
Yeah, the MSC in that year was very wild
Well, we have sent soldiers to Kosovo, and they are there until today
It was the right thing to do, but we couldn’t get an UN-Mandate
Afghanistan has not been an illegal war
That’s very legal compared to the others
Most of Austrian is very similar to Bavarian
Personally, I like the Viennese accent very much and the Tyrolean accent is thick but warm
And then there is the accent of Vorarlberg, that is Alemannic and therefore a bit strange
Sorry Penislord321, it was not my intention to hurt your feelings
She and the whole federal govt deserve credit, but also the Prime Ministers and Ministers of the German states, who hold the direct political power, because without good coordination between federal and state level nothing would work out
Look at other federal republics, like the US, where one part of the country is in lockdown, while on part of the country protests against lockdowns and completely misses the point
We can be very glad everyone is working together
We Germans have the most boring leader and you guys have the most … interesting leader
Tbh, talking in front of the public is really not her strength
Where are you from
Most of Germans like her very much - but would never vote for her party
(Stupid autocorrection made in front to infringement)
But he has no chance to get a relevant job other then MP
But some are saying in the end he is since a year the real health minister: [Der Professor und sein Minister  ]
Merkel is the last name of her first husband
So she also know the emotional side of having a divorce ;)
Of course
Everyone lost track how often our last chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, has been married…
Well, she has studied physics but has a PhD in quantum chemistry
So both is right
Oh, that’s a cute name
How did that go down
When did he have the time to cut two people's heads off
> why isn't this said more often to these extremists
What kind of dumbass question is that
How often do you listen in to conversation with "extremists"?
Radical Islam as opposed to uncool Islam
If you don't "tolerate intolerance" you are not a liberal democracy
> Liberties are only worth it if you've got security
I'd rather have a pacified country, with strict rules
What kind of abominable pussy are you
You give up your freedoms without even being threatened by anything
What in the world are you talking about
"Giving a soft pass"?!
There is absolutely nothing that can stop a person from stabbing others
Do you want to outlaw knives
Slovakia also doesn't recognize cardiac arrest as an emergency and hence no one dies from it there
What kind of fucking idiot are you
There is two terrorist attacks and you think you aren't safe
That's not a political problem
That's a problem with you being a piss poor statistician
And in German the wannabe-Nazis just said in the Bundestag that transporting children by bike should be banned
Only transporting them by car should be allowed
I’ve thought that a woman is beautiful and a man is handsome - and both mean the same
Isnt that the case
Yeah, I got this after my comment
Karajan or Furtwängler
Just get rid of speed limits on highways
That stuff is so stupid
So in Germany that would be everyone below 200 km/h?
>	It’s about people endangering others‘ lives
Yeah, That’s why the German Autobahn is so dangerous
Why should a speed limit make a highway safer
You wrote:
>	It's about people endangering others' lives
High speed on the highway is not „endangering others lives“ - otherwise the German Autobahn must be really dangerous
It isnt
It’s really safe to drive in Germany compared to places with speed limits on highways
So speed limits are solving exactly nothing
It’s a thread about speed limits in /r/Europe
So Germany is not part of Europe anymore
Its the feeling of disappointment
The old FDP was the greatest party Germany has had
So many impressive people have been members of this party
But they are sadly now only shadows of this greatness and have betrayed the liberal German society for reducing this party mostly to a *big company* party
They still have few great people in the federal parliament, but in the states they are often more right wing than the conservatives nowadays, often appeasing the AFD
This evolution is really sad
Some of them are *really* good people
Like Agnes-Marie Strack-Zimmermann and Konstantin Kuhle
But sadly not the current party leadership
Sadly
But luckily only on weekends…
An article about her family gets harassed and your first respond is „her parents are so fucking awful“. Well done
I have never seen that someone is going after e.g. Merkels husband…
Ah, of course some one of east Europe is posting such things
First Merkel, now Greta
It’s about her little sister…
Why is she going after the city of Hamburg
More of [this]
She is one of the most world wide hated person by the far-right and the far-left…
Here in the Munich area most villages have switched to geothermal district heating
But we are very lucky, nearly no where else in Germany is it safe to have geothermal power plants
Otherwise we couldn’t see the old lady, could we
Most of them, but they have also a few good ones
She is not a reporter, she is one of the protestors (and the Secretary General of the German liberals)
That’s cultural appropriation
That’s a 100% German thing
There are also Greens from Bavaria ;)
So, /r/Polandball but as Yaoi
i like it
Who isn’t hot in this picture
That’s the magic of Yaoi
Hmm
The most confusing thing is:
Yaoi is something like gay hentai, but in some way it isn’t. It’s mostly consumed by Japanese *straight* woman
Gays mostly prefer Bara
So even if this „Yaoi thing“ is kinda gay, the real people this is for are straight women - not gay dudes
It’s a bit funny
Yeah, I wonder if lesbians like the „lesbian porn“ that is made for straight guys
If I go from this example here (straight women like it but gay men not so much), I’ve some doubts…
So lesbians and gays can agree on straight porn
Not for them
Same here
But I’ve to admit they are a bit annoying at the gay hentai websites
Women with a dick are still something for guys who like women
Why the hell are traps in our category
They are women (with dicks)
why should any gay man be attracted to them
Same here :)
I don't think you know what devil's advocate means
As one [German newspaper] wrote:
>	*EU decides something important with many billions, which nobody understands*
>	Brussels (dpo) - Good news or perhaps bad news from Brussels
The heads of government of the EU member states have today decided on something complicated, involving billions of euros, which nobody really understands
>	According to most observers, the decision was about 750 billion euros or even a higher amount to be distributed or something
Or it is only this amount that is guaranteed, but in the end the money does not actually flow at all, right
Or does it
In any case, that has finally been decided
>	Apparently, the vote is a milestone of historical significance
At least one has to assume so, because the politicians involved were all very excited and according to media reports debated longer than usual
Furthermore, all those involved stress that this is a milestone of historical significance
>	As with almost all decisions in Brussels, it is to be assumed that the individual EU citizen will not actually feel any concrete effects in the end, but is nevertheless firmly convinced that he or she has been taken for a ride
I know, Norway is not in the EU, but I just imagined [Merkel and Solberg] taking secretly cocaine at the toilet together ;)
As is tradition
Ask Poland
You have to exaggerate and after some years you can slowly reduce it to one single main element and then suddenly something like [this] is enough
Where is the Vatican
The same way that Kosovo can use the Euro despite not being in the Eurozone: Noone can be bothered
You never know
Right, I didn't know that
Does San Marino have an agreement regarding open borders
What
Talk to my railway station
A railway facility where trains regularly stop to load or unload passengers and/or freight
Eh aren’t you using your own language then
Or at least your own dialect instead of using Bavarian
Because it would be pointless to have empty trains running around without passengers and freight
Exactly
I don’t understand railway stations when I speak to them
Do you
Well, isn’t in some way 180° up also flat
Keep in mind, these EU numbers are not the whole European numbers
If you would include also the UK and Russia it would be even higher
Why
The EU has more people than the US and the UK has far less people
Also the UK isn’t included in the EU numbers
[Naja]
Merkel was so frustrated two days ago
She wanted strict rules in whole Germany but some Prime Ministers didn’t want that
It’s so stupid that the federal government cannot do anything in this pandemic
The USA has nearly as many ICU beds per capita as Germany
That are good numbers
Many European nations like the UK are [way below that]
How much of a fault has your health care system in this high death rate
Or seems you guys don’t have much ICU beds
Then go with [the German numbers] instead of the UK numbers
Iconic
Same in German
Marriage is for masochists
Hitler ignores the restrictions placed on Germany
That's ok
Hitler abolishes democracy in Germany
That's ok
He just wants peace and a strong people
Hitler takes Austria
That's ok
He'll be contempt and he only wants peace
...
It took the Brits an eternity to realize that yielding to Hitler didn't make him stop
Now we see the same attitude towards Putin: The loudest voices all accuse the West of not yielding enough
I'm not a psychologist, but that seems very foolish
If we don't resist now, the costs of resisting will only increase
Yeah, but the press is already pounding on the EU for just allowing the Ukraine to *maybe* join at some point in the future
Imagine the backlash they'd get from actually helping it's citizens against the Russians
In my idealistic vision of the Union it would defend people everywhere, but we're far from that
>It did work with Hitler until the allies declared war on him when he attack Poland
If you don't see how self defeating that sentence is, you must be retarded
This doesn't even need an argument, you said it yourself: Hitler attacked Poland
Therefore appeasement **didn't work**.
What major problems
They don't have a war within or a famine or anything like that
Also the EU is not supposed to just fill the pockets of entrepreneurs, but also to defend liberal democracy
And I think we should push it to fulfil that promise
Even if it was harsh, that's hardly something the Germans should complain about, because what they'd have done with France would have been much worse
It's as close as you can get to a war between Gandalf and Sauron in the real world
Of course the Allies were not purely dedicated to human flourishing in all their decisions in the world, but the aggression in the war came *entirely* from the fascists and monarchists and their defeat was a big step forward for humanity
You'd live in a very different world if the fascists had won and you should be grateful for not knowing that world
I guess if everyone in front of you kills themselves before you can, you are not technically be at war
Since you insist that everything be yielded to the fascists and their terror be unanswered, I guess you agree with them
Would you feel that it is wise to unconditionally yield to an aggressive liberal democracy
It is ludicrous that the EU should be pushed around by Russia at all
That's like a sparrow telling an eagle where it may or may not fly
that upside down flag though lol
Ein Reichsbürger
Just go to the Oktoberfest…
makes sense
A broomstick parade…
outstanding move
What is meant with "the holocaust happened" here
That the Nazis intended to exterminate the Jews in Europe
Or what were they asked
Were the people of 2004 asked the same question as the ones in 2020
This is really weird to me
Yeah I want to know where this is from and what questions they asked exactly
That's really surprising to me
I don't think the actual genocide is the worst part of what the Nazis did, but there is a recording of Himmler directly stating their intention to eradicate the Jews in Europe - perhaps that should be more widely known
Curious
If the holocaust happened, how come they are still alive
Checkmate
The West in general has a huge problem with Islamophilia
It's the perfect combination, a religion (protection+), perceived minority (protection+) and tension from Islamic terrorism (protection+)
Leftism blends into anti-Americanism, "anti-imperialism", which is adjacent to anti-semitism
I have never met a boomer that wasn't super anti-fascist
Found the Zeit-Podcast listener
And have no real borders there cause Austria has its own rule about it, Switzerland has its own rule and Germany is just saying: ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Oh, there was last week a podcast about european sausages
So I thought … nevermind
*sorts by controversial*
I think they used the graph from last time and just changed the numbers
But that’s really not acceptable for the ARD, they are not a private news agency
However, in their [PDF] to this study they used the right proportions…
>	I will now name a few countries and please tell me whether the respective country is a partner for Germany that can be trusted or not
This was the exact question
To be honest, after snowden the us numbers were similar…
The UK had since recently always high numbers in this poll - even after they decided to leave
[Have a look]
Thanks a lot for your work
Sadly I am lacking the skills to validate their or your work, but I just trust you on this
If you enjoy to make validations I would ask you if you could quickly check if they also messed the graph up in their official [PDF]
ARD is usually not known for doing this - they are usually seen as the most thrustful news in Germany
That’s the reason why every German here is really pissed
When I wrote similar I thought more on the peak in 2009
compared to then it’s similar
But you are of course right
>	Ich nenne Ihnen jetzt einige Länder und Sie sagen mir bitte, ob das jeweilige Land ein Partner für Deutschland ist, dem man vertrauen kann oder nicht
>	(I will now name a few countries and please tell me whether the respective country is a partner for Germany that can be trusted or not
The question was specifically for Germany alone
Putin usually does not order assassinations on German people…
Lol reddit has the most inane discussions ever
That's not what globalism means
So "globalism is when you don't hate foreigners" is the same as "letting global superpowers take over instead"?
Next time name Bavaria not just Germany, but Prussia
It gets not more offensive
Well, we do actually like BaWu like no other German state
So I am not that offended
Prussia would be much more insulting
Why is there the German foreign minister in the background
Ugh, that’s horrible
Maybe we should make Kosovo an EU member state
They are paying something via the EU (until the end of this year)
Yeah, but first we should cut off the F4 from the EU budget so we are able to do such things
Otherwise they would veto it
We even have negative interest rates
Investors are willing to lose some of their money for the possibility to give it to the German government
I understand why but it’s also a little bit crazy
Why not
Money is not an relevant thing in German politics anymore since years with negative interest rates
But it seems it’s relevant for other nations, they even have to pay interest rates by their own if they want money, instead of getting money for taking money
So we give them some of our money and making profit with it
Nope, the F4
its not like the V4 an old and official group
They created themselves unofficial in the beginning of this year as the so called „frugal four“:
-	Sebastian Kurz, chancellor of Austria
-	Mette Frederiksen, prime minister of Denmark
-	Mark Rutte, prime minister of the Netherlands
-	Stefan Lofven, prime minister of Sweden
But unlike the V4 it’s not the nations who build this group, it’s just those four people
So it’s a little bit like a cheap western - and Frederiksen has already left this group today
You can't leave one of the biggest markets, who is also nearest to you, and expect business to beg you to build in your country
He should have said that they have chosen Germany cause it’s strong and stable
You are really nice and good looking people :)
He has chosen high taxes, high wages, powerful unions, many public holidays an a very difficult legal situation to fire a worker
Europe wide supply chain
It’s a big shock that he will make cars in Germany
That’s very unusual here
Emotional and bitter
Why can't it have been a competitor
eg Heathrow
Wenn deinen Mutter nicht in das Schwimmbecken gesprungen wäre, dann hätte die ESA heute auf dem Mars kein Wasser gefunden
lol Brazil
Greater Bavaria*
I'm 100% sure Elizabeth will make it to #1
Only if France is also allowed in
But including the Baltics
lol this is the funniest sad shit I've seen in a while
So should we be allowed to deny the Holocaust just because Nazi Germany was "technically" a different country than the Federal Republic
Could also be foreigners visiting Munich during Oktoberfest
They are wearing [weird things]
We could avoid so many discussions about this issue if we would just introduce a new term like this funny „Middle Europe“.
Go Belgium
Looks a bit like Valetta
Yes, German experts [have confirmed this] already last week:
>	*Experts give the all-clear: people do not get infected with Corona when they demonstrate for a good cause*
>	Berlin, Munich (dpo) - Is there a threat of a new corona wave after the Black Lives Matter demos with over 100,000 participants nationwide over the weekend
In view of the failure to observe safety distances in some of the demonstrations, researchers have investigated the issue and can now give the all-clear:  Fortunately, people do not get infected with Corona when they demonstrate for a good cause
>	"The corona virus may be a deadly virus, but it also has principles," explains virologist Heike Theis of the Berlin Charité hospital
"It's looking very closely at what is being demonstrated for
When it comes to fabulously stupid concerns such as protesting against compulsory vaccination, the chipping of citizens by Bill Gates or an imaginary "re-population", the virus infects as many as possible
However, if the occasion of the demonstration is a good thing, the virus respects this and deliberately holds back".
>	Another factor could also be that, in contrast to the Hildmann Naidoo hygiene demos, at least the majority of the demonstrators wore protective masks and in many cities the protests were designed as "silent demos".
>	In addition, it was possible that at least during the demonstration against police violence in Hamburg, the water cannons subsequently used by the police simply washed away any corona viruses - valuable help that the participants in the hygiene demonstrations did not have

You are aware that there is no EU wide plan
Not even in every EU member state is a *nation* wide plan
For example, Germany has nearly the exact same situation like the USA - every of the 16 German states is doing what they want
The federal government is all the time just trying to coordinate, but not always that successful
The federal level can’t do anything - let alone the EU level
Same here with this outlet
We have an old satirical magazine („Titanic“) and they have even two MEPs in the European Parliament (don’t ask why)
But the magazine is old and not that good anymore
This „Postillion“ is young and much better
Mate, I have acknowledged the US situation and just said that we have a similar situation in Germany
Thuringia is now getting rid of fucking *all* corona policies while Bavaria remains very strict
I don’t get it while you think I have done the opposite and am saying that „all of the US is just one thing“.
Really
Not even in the cinema or public transportation
They have founded their own party („[The Party]
And since Germany is one single constituency in the European elections and we have 96 seats and no percentage threshold you actually don’t need that much percent for a seat
That’s the reason why there have been 41 different parties at the ballot paper
They won nearly 900,000 votes or 2
4% of the German total, thus winning two seats
Was really close to three seats
Interesting
One German state, Thuringia, has also abolished *all* mandatory Corona policies
It will be very interesting how their numbers will be in one or two weeks
Well, there are plenty of studies out there saying the opposite
But if it’s working for you, then I’m happy for you
>	but if it makes you feel good
Well, that’s something :)
oh, it looks like a sad, little condom :(
~~Wtf
We have official *Marx Year* here in Germany
Even the Federal government pays tribute to him, also the CEOs of the big capitalistic companies
Do you even know what Marx wrote
I'm apparently stupid
Fuck, sorry, that’s what ITT means
Didn’t know that, I thought he equated Marxists with neo-Nazis
Shame one me
Bavaria legalised it in 1811…
The entire Balkan peninsula and some American college students with coloured hair will heavily disagree with that sentiment
That’s why Google just gave up
Back then so many Germans demanded Google to blur their house that google simply gave up

What’s that
Maybe not the best words…
Then just change your laws
You have sich nice motorways
Really fun to drive
Prove it
Sounds like you have just insulted the German Chancellorette…

Well, they do it at least [abroad]
Well, politicians go often out [for a drink]
Reminds me at [this]
He is really smiling
Something is wrong…
you could start a war because of this
They are really playing it save
All popular opinions in Germany
Calling right wing populists Nazis is about as daring as talking about the weather
What a disappointment
Yeah the most important voters of the AKP are basically hillbillies
Would be nice
How high is the approval rating for Nexit

Guys, you needed also help from your neighbours during corona
Come on
Per person mostly from Ireland and in absolute numbers mostly from Germany
Both nations are mostly ok with it
Only those tiny nations like Austria and Netherlands are complaining
So does Germany and Ireland…
I don't understand why everyone in this thread thinks this map is based off of culture
It's geographical, not cultural
lol im a dumbass
She's one of the most corrupt politicians in all of europe, heavily into censorship and overt nepotism
She kept massively overpaying "consultants" from either her personal friends or her family in every office she's ever held in germany, and iirc was one of the main targets of corporate lobbying in the Bundestag
This post is trying to make her look like your cozy family mother
It is blatant political propaganda
Gift this man a trip to America
Do the countries who will have female monarchs no male-preference succession or are they just the only children the current monarch has and could get moved back if they get a brother
[Angela Merkel] /s
Merkel has an extremely high approval rating - but she decided not to run again next year
Tbf, the German President has a 2 term limit, too
^(*Joachim)
Nah, why should it
He could have stayed in Germany
He knew exactly what he is doing
Germany has saved his life and gave him shelter
No other nation has done that
I always thought it’s the hottest in Sevilla
How is 31° freezing
Cries in 31°
Colorado seems nice
Had the luck to visit it last year in spring
Was still very hot - but the most beautiful city I’ve ever been in Europe
Lucky guy
That was not the case here in Munich :-/
They are in different european families

The most important German news magazine once used an [incorrect German flag] It’s only three colours, it’s not that hard
So yeah, sometimes we have the same here…
Well, *some* things have changed in the last 48 hours
There is no leadership battle inside the SPD
They have announced their „candidate“ months ago
But the social democrats have archived everything they have wanted in Germany over the last 100 years
Nowadays they don’t know what they want additionally
So other parties are now more relevant
And what other of this six parties is a factual ecologist in your opinion
Same as the other four major parties
Except the AfD every party is anti-nuclear
Germany has been destroyed two times in the last century
But yeah, having a green chancellor is much worse, I get you
Greens polled worse in the latest EU election than their actual result was
Yeah, cause the current conservatives-liberal government in NRW is doing such a great job
Thats an non-issue in this elections
No one is going to talk about nuclear energy
Schulz’ polling success was based on his personality
That’s not the case with ACAB
Also strongest party in Munich
Yeah, I’ll feel free
As a supporter of the greens my fear is that they will fuck it up (again) in the next months, not that the polls are wrong
But then again the current leadership hasn’t fucked up an election so far
It’s good to be more Realo than Fundi
Well, this is simply the first poll after all the things that have happened in the last 48 hours
-	ACAB was nominated by the Greens
-	Laschet was nominated by the conservatives
I think Latvia has the highest ratio of women to men in the world
So it would be worth a trip - but I heard it's all old babushkas
The 17th Bundesland
Catalonia and Scotland, but no Bavaria
:-/
Bavaria is a country, too
There is nothing that makes Scotland special in any way compared to Bavaria
Bavaria is its own free state with its own constitution
It depends on your definition of the term "country". It can mean "sovereign state", but then Scotland isn't a country either
The official term for the 16 German "states" is "Länder" (singular "Land") which translates directly to "country".
No one recognise them as country
Only UK
BTW: has Schottland at least it’s own constitution
What do you think is the translation of „Länder“?
Mate, I’ve no negative feelings about Scotland at all
But when you look at the facts then many regions in Europe including Bavaria have more  characteristics of a nation then Scotland has
We call ourselves „free state“, you call yourselves „nation“. But that are just names, doesn’t mean anything in both cases
Oh, it’s the German quotes
They are also used in Austria, but funnily not in Switzerland (they also don’t use the letter „ß“ (double s))
What are those huge mountains doing in the Middle of Germany
Those should be tiny compared to the Alps
Also they didn't include Munich

Maybe you should learn from your southern neighbours ;P

I am very sorry for this
There is one group with EU members and here you can see the EU average
These other nations don’t influence the EU average, therefore there are in another group

Isn’t it in the USA that they lack a normal banking system with normal bank accounts, online banking and so on
If you have to write a cheque for every single bill then maybe more people will procrastinate
and Scottland
Yeah, nations with a lots of embassies often serve as a secondary embassy for other nations
For example Switzerland is doing this for the USA in Iran
It’s not even really the same inside a nation
Like for example back then India gave out 3-months tourist visas for Germans, but in the consulate in Munich Bavarians could get a six-months visa
There are so many different statistics for this, it’s really confusing
Says someone from East Germany…
Fact is: Viennese is the most beautiful dialect, by far
What other dialect is able to compete in your opinion
Even most Swiss dialects are better then German Swabian
At least Salzburg could come back to Bavaria…
Hmm
Currently those industry is sometimes even moving to Germany…
That’s a thing from the US society
We don’t send „thoughts and prayers“ here in Germany
That would be very strange to say
There are trees in Iceland
We were always more than 30
Always

G7 Summit conclusion:
If you demand it *in some way*, they have to give it to you
They don’t need a button or something
I can’t open your link, but when you are not accepting their terms - or parts of it - they are free to make no deals with you and kick you out of their websites
So giving you something free when you’re accepting all the terms should be legal, I think
Here in Germany Dunkirk doesn’t matter at all
We mostly learn nearly nothing about the participation of the UK in WW2
Its all the time the Russians, continental Europe and in the end the US…
We don't cover WW2 in general lol
The Nazi Regime, sure, the Holocaust, the Ideology, the Propaganda, even the economy, all in great detail
But the War itself is on the clear backburner
Well, some countries are thinking that the UK was basically unimportant in WW2…
We learn about the important nations
Russia, France and the USA…
I didn’t say that it is true
Just mentioned how our teachers are seeing it
That’s the reason why in Germany there is often a confusion why the Brits are so focused on WW2, cause we often wondering ourselves “did they even participate
Jep, my grandfather was in Stalingrad…
If this reality makes you happy, then keep it
But… wörk, wörk, wörk
Is this allowed in Germany
As usual Germany
Germany will close many coal plants in 2021 - together with the last remaining nuclear power plants
Are there similar plans in Poland for coal power plants
It’s illegal to eat Weißwurst after 12, so that sounds not that bad…
Even many German greens regretting nowadays the order of the two phase outs
But it’s to late to change it now
But non of them will replaced with gas power plants but with renewables
Häresie
>	gas lobby group Zukunft Erdgas said on Wednesday
Not your ass, but out of their ass
And i am not arguing with you that nuclear is better for the climate then gas
That’s true
But the phase out was a decision made in 1999/2000
Sadly the zeitgeist in Germany at that time was not focusing on the climate…
Ehrlich gesagt bin ich eh seit 15 Jahren Vegetarier, ich kann da eigentlich gar nicht mehr mitreden… ;)

Not arguing against that
Even Sanders claims that he is a socialist
Stupid
Hehe, these Icelandic numbers are always funny
Why am I part of the problem
I live on the other side of the planet
Does he
As far as I know he is always saying „democratic socialist“ - while in fact his ideas would rather qualify him as social democrat
Well, for their standards even the CSU would be a socialist party…
Then why calling yourself a socialist at the first place
I mean, Bavaria has the most social programs of all German states
Typical for a Christian *Social* Union
With all respect - I don’t think he has so much time left ;)

At least in Germany its thought in school that we were basically defeated by you guys, if this might „help“ you a little bit
Ignore the others, we German know the truth
If it is true what people here are saying he has quite a history
There is a nice Icelandic novel about this issue
It called „Rökkurbýsnir“ (From the Mouth of the Whale) - with the most powerful first three pages I have ever read
Bombastic Prologue
-	Author: Sjón
-	Title (in English): From the Mouth of the Whale
-	Year: 2008
The Title is really strange, it’s completely different in English (From the Mouth of the Whale) , German (The Glistering of the Night) or Icelandic (The Demons of Darkness)
I have no clue why they changed the title so much in different languages
So maybe in Hungarian it will be again a totally different title
But Sjón only published one book in 2008, so it should be possible to find it
WTF
This is great :)
Everyone here really likes the Irish at the moment
Even without ever having met an actual Irish person
That’s the fallout of Brexit ;)
But many people see you guys currently as bullied by the UK

Seriously, let them crash out, take the hit, and fuck off
The good stuff is already happening
Without Brexit there would be no PESCO and all the other discussions about further EU integration
I am very happy that the UK is leaving…
Yeah, I think we should not punish the UK but helping them by giving them a good trade deal
I would be in favour of creating two EUs: one less political integrated but economically very integrated
And one that could do the real hot shit, like building a European Federation
The UK and others like Hungary could join the economic Union without worrying that it would took away their “sovereignty“ and we others could build the real Europe

I am a firm believer that the future belongs to the railway
Mostly freight
But also passengers
And as such high speed rail is a important part of it
Did you ever have to change trains at München Hbf
2nd highest amount of platforms in the world behind New York grand central
And no footbridge or tunnel
If your train arrives at track 5 and you need to get a connection on track 27 you will walk for ~20 min
Yes
Sleeper trains are also great, but high speed rail still has its advantages
Munich is a terminus
It also has two wing stations which are only accessible by walking the length of the respective side platforms
Never said they were
But for a trip like Berlin to Paris high speed rail would be more practical than overnight trains
Although for longer routes the overnight trains get more attractive
Anything that can be driven within one night
But what would be even better
Overnight high speed rail
Imagine the distances that could be covered while driving 350 km/h in one night
I suppose we are the country with most resentiments against Germany
I can confirm this
I would say it’s more normal to drive to Italy than to the north of Germany
Orangina is actually from Tunesia, not Italy
Esprit was founded in San Francisco and now has it's HQ in Pembroke
But I think much of it belongs to a Hong Konger since long ago and the Hong Kong part of it today is the biggest

Don’t you use Cyrillic letters

Yes
They are even speaking Bavarian
We also “kinda” understand you
This is the way
We Bavarians are in the weirdest position between these two
On the one hand we are part of Germany
On the other hand we are culturally closest to Austria

East Germany
Especially the smaller towns are dead since all the people fled to the west after the curtain fell
How nice of them that they still included German
I think the Americans thinking Ireland being part of England is right up there
We have speed limits
There are some sections on the Autobahn where there is no speed limit for a few kilometers but even these often get adjusted by these dynamic speed limit light thingys, adjusting for traffic and weather
There are even much longer parts without speed limit
What I wanted to say is, it's not like Autobahn is automatically no speed limit
Start out in East Berlin, first missions in Trabant
After a few missions the prologue ends with fleeing to west Berlin
There you connect with West Berlin criminals
Later there has to be a time where you return for a few missions (maybe helping a buddy/family member cross the border) and Stasi is having it's eye on you this time
Also: Potential to meet Bowie and Iggy Pop (or corresponding characters)
Love it
Good point

We signed a treaty saying we don’t have a claim to it

Only problem is I don't know how to get my soldiers past the shops and warehouses

In Bavaria I’ve never seen a private German flag
(Except for sport events) But it’s kinda normal to have a [Bavarian] flag
There aren’t so many but I guess in some villages and small cities there is one person who has one hanging in the front
For example my uncle has some variants of it
With a club symbol or even with our last king on the flag
In my village I know 2 Bavarian flags and one Italian flag
Outside of football
Yes
But in Bavaria it is really common to see Bavarian flags
Why are you right if you have a Greek flag
In Bavaria farmers often buy fertilizer etc
in Zentner’s
I also heard of some parents from Berlin who wanted to call their son 'Pikachu'. Of course, the state didn't allow it
Their reason for the denial was "Pikachu doesn't identify the child with a specific gender".
Now the kid's name is "Pikachu Kevin".
English, because usually the community is mainly English-speaking and it helps not having to look up translations for certain things if you have a question
And guides are usually betztr in English too and I'm having problems following them when it's in English but my game in German
Here I am
Depends on your viewpoint though
I totally agree with you
But I was simply making a little joke
Austrians coming to my town keep usually speaking their native accent since (at least where I live) the dialect is similar to most of the Austrian ones
But it sounds very odd if a nothern German tries to adapt to the Bavarian dialect
It's better to keep your own accent
In that way it sounds more natural

In East Germany it was quite popular to call their children "Randy" but spelled it "Rändi"
I believe that’s the case in Germany, isn’t it
Merkel was born in eastern Germany - a separate country at the time
Isn’t **everything** Soros fault at that point
Maybe Spiegel
Or was that only a Franz Joseph Strauß thing
Hitler profited from burning down the parliament building
Orban has a fucking pandemic to his disposal
It was a homage to a scandal from the 60s. Franz Joseph Strauß, back then Minister of defense, had the Spiegel headquarters raided by police and a couple of journalists jailed
Officially because they ran an article stating according to a governmental study that the German army was only partly ready for defense
They claimed they unveiled top secret information and thus committed treason
In reality it was because Der Spiegel was not particularly friendly to Strauß and criticized him often
It drew a huge outcry of criticism because it was not only really illegal but also in violation of the German constitution
In the end it led to Strauß’s firing from the position of minister of defense
BER is a pretty big joke here

My grandfather had to go to the HJ (Hitler youth organisation)
He was expelled due to too "communistic opinions" (he is a democrat and votes for the middle-to-right-wing party CSU)
Then he had to go to the army where he was imprisioned by the French when he was 18
He was able to flee
He still lives and he's now 91
I didn't elaborate well, sorry for that
He was imprisioned *in* France, not by the French ;)
We have five official languages in Germany
German, Danish, Sorbic, Firsian and Romani
Have not seen anyone do that except for maybe kids
On Oktoberfest, we didn't find a table so we asked a few girls if we could be with them the evening
We were having pretty good conversations until I asked them where they're from
They said they're living in Munich
I asked them in German "you're kidding
" We all had to live because we talked around an hour in English without realising we're all from Munich
It turned out one of the girls even lives in the same street as I do
And that's really uncommon
Munich is a big city and the propability to meet someone on the very international Oktoberfest who lives in the same street is rather unlikely
We had a good evening with them, was really funny :)

Well theres the tale of the chapel in the ebersberger forest
Its a small white chapel that sits right beside a country road which goes through the forest
Its said that many years ago a woman and her child got run over right next to the chapel and the driver fled, now when you drive past the chapel at night she might stand there in a white dress and raise her hand ( as in hitchhiking)
The legend says you have to take her with you, if you refuse to she will show up in your car, block your steering and brakes and run you into a tree
Honestly the chapel alone is kinda creepy already and that story does not make it better
Only my dialect has a few
For example:
"I" for "I"
"a" for "too"
We say "An Opfl". Doesn't matter, you're right
"Too" is written "aa" and "a" is written "a"
This wasn't Bavarian
Scheich dich du Saupreiß. I dad a wort ratschn mit dia
This is Bavarian

Outside of school two things

And only being able to speak English with my dads friends

I've never actively tried to improve my English, it just came with time
Thank god English is a relatively easy language
Buy your meat and eggs and maybe dairy products from local farmers or butchers
It will cost more, but it is way more environmentally friendly
And the cost is a incentive to eat less meat
Also
It tastes better than the stuff from the supermarket
As you said, Hitler
But tbf, Hitler lived nearby the German border
That’s a fairly similar sentiment as in Germany
Most Germans did not know(or did not care to much), what would happen, in 1933
Later a big part was opportunism
If for example you are a teacher
You would have nearly guaranteed joined the nazi party and the nazi teacher federation

At one point we had the APPD
Anarchistische Pogo-Partei Deutschland
Their goals (copy paste):
-Right to unemployment with full salary
-Youth pension instead of retirement pension
-Abolishment of compulsory education
-Creation of centers for physical love, so-called Mitfickzentralen (literally "fuckpooling centers")
-Abolition of police
-Legalization of all drugs
-Abolition of the right to demonstrate with prior announcement (abolition of distinction between permitted and not permitted)
-Totale Rückverdummung ("total restupidification") and balkanization of Germany
-Reconstitute the German borders from 1237 (a satire on the aim of some German extreme-right parties to restore the German borders during the time of Nazism and World War II - or World War I)
While this is more on the satire side of things like "Die Partei" is today, we have freaks like "Die Bayernpartei" that aim for Bavaria to leave Germany and become a country of it's own
And they truly believe in it
Truth is, that would suck for everyone, no matter what conservative Bavarians or "bavariaphobic" fishheads want to believe
I had a school trip when I was 6 and the older children told me about sex

Kartoffel is one of my favorites
Same with us
I could read a Dutch newspaper
How similar is afrikaans to Dutch for a native speaker
In this case we don’t necessarily want to be associated with our brethren’s north of the “weißwuaschd meridian”
In parts
Yeah, that's totally true
Also, there are some Franconian people who want Franconia to leave Bavaria and be a seperate state
My profs just make videos and upload them onto the uni's platform
The Grand Tour did a little tour of such places in Germany and Austria
Namely Wank, Kissing, Petting, Fucking, Wedding
Lederhose in East Germany
Everything from 33 to 45
Hindenburg's decision to announce Hitler as new Reichkanzler (Chancellor of the Reich) lead to lots of innocent deaths and the deadliest war of all time
To me as a German/Bavarian it's whatever the Viennese, including their bums, speak when they insult me
I'm not saying it's "Viennese" bc someone told me almost no one would still speak that today and what you are hearing in Vienna would just be some bastard dialect
Anyway, they will call you the most disgusting things but with such an effortless elegant arrogance, it will make anyone in Berlin go pale with envy
I think it's not even the words they use but just the way they say it
They can say the most stupid things but it will sound like a dance
And they can't not dance
To me everything will sound like that, if they want it or not and most of the time they will look for every occasion to insult you (even if just mildly) anyway
It's like someone doing backflips to go to the toilet or juggling while fucking or solving a rubiks cube while shooting up heroin
Just a small effortless exercise in arrogance and making everyone feel that you are annoyed by their existence
I'm in love with it but after a few days in Vienna it always gets a bit much and I'm relieved to be back in Bavaria where people will just sound like the degenerate mountain men they are and not honk at every German license plate they see, only at Munich license plates
I personally have never seen one but there are some stores which have foreign food (polish of course too)
I know some Russian stores but no polish one or I didn’t see that it is polish ^ ^
From a Bavarian point of view
Other Germans will gladly complete this with their unrestrained opinion about Bavaria :P
**Berlin** - Huge
Dirty
Lazy hipster smartasses
**Lower Saxony** - Best Saxony
Actually we don't know shit about it other than that it's pretty flat and bc of that not a candidate for Bavarian annexion
**Baden-Württemberg** - Hard working and just as rich as we are but stingy
They have dialects that even a Bavarian deems worthy of the word "extraordinary".
**Rhineland-Palatinate** - Wine
Some parts might get confused with NRW or Hesse
**Saxony** - Nazis everywhere
Leipzig is a proud exception and I love them for it
They have some of the poorest regions in Germany and it's probably the reason why they are so angry and also why some of them came here and "took er jerbs
" They are welcome as long as they behave
**Thuringia** - Also a lot of Nazis but not as many as in Saxony
Good Bratwurst
Nice landscapes, even Bavaria has to admit that
**Hessen** - "Äpplwoi" and "Handkäs". You love those or you hate those
Their capital is worthy of the word "capital". As in "capitalism".
**North Rhine-Westphalia** - Looks like a damn shithole
But you have to be there to see that it's more than that
This is the westiest west Germany has to west
Small beer glasses but just take 3 or 5 of them at once and you're fine
But be aware, some of their beer is like piss and some is like gods piss
This is the place in Germany where If feel like I am judged the least about where I am from, how I talk, how I look or whatever
**Saxony-Anhalt** - Pretty similar to Saxony
Just like their southern brothers they are pretty afraid of foreigners bc they have never seen one before
**Brandenburg** - Here you can feel the Prussian heritage the strongest and that kind of makes them our nemesis
**Mecklenburg-Vorpommern** - Where East-Germans liked to go for vacations and I think they still like it
**Hamburg** - The most true leftist and alternative place in DE
Where some in Berlin act like it bc style and that's a modern hipster thing to do, in Hamburg they just live it
**Schleswig-Holstein** - Wacken
Also everyday when I go take a shit, the thing I flush down when I'm done is bigger than their biggest mountain
**Saarland** - How come this is not France and Alsace is
TV tells me incest would be a stereotype applicable here but tbh I never heard about this stereotype in real life
**Bremen** - They speak the cleanest German
And that's about it
edit: uh, I think I somehow got that confused with Hannover
However that happened
So now I have zero stereotypes left for Bremen
**Bavaria** - Gods holy land and a nation made of the direct descendents of Jesus and his royal highness King Ludwig themselves
They are of majestic beauty, speaking in sacred tongues only understood by those God deemed worthy
Generous, intelligent (just bc you don't speak our sacred tongue does not mean it's not smart things that we have to say) and hard-working
Everybody loves us in all of Germany and all over the world
It's true
We have the best beer and the best food, at the very latest since we acquired a new Franconia that now graces our large inventory of smaller countries that sometimes try to defy our warm godly embrace but in the end know that their place is by our side and thus by the side of all that is right and good in this world
This is where God and everyone else in Germany comes to dine and for vacation and spends abnormous amounts to have a small piece of our country
And then we are unkind and condescending to them bc that is what the Lord told us to do
Amen
edit:
Also, even if I am not an Austrian, I want to say a thing about
**Vienna** - The amount of love they have for themselves (as in "a single Viennese has for himself", not for his community), the amount of cool and casual unfriendlyness and arrogance and hate for everyone but especially everything further away than Vienna Woods is bigger than everything I have ever seen before
If Berliners would know about anything outside of Berlin they would die of envy bc the Viennese arrogance and unkindness not only rivals theirs, it surpasses the "Berliner Schnauze" and the Berlin arrogance by a lot
I love it
Even their bums can spit their hate for you being German in your face with such effortless elegance, it's astounding
Being yelled or honked at for being German is a must for every vacation in Vienna
Put that on your list if you're planning to visit
Yes
That also does not make anything I said less true
Oh damn, you're right about that
I should have known better
Well, it's Bavarian arrogance I guess
What
There is no such place
Lies
Dirty lies
Yeah CSU frightens me too
ahem I mean "I am overawed by our lords ambassadors"
^^^send ^^^help
Back then it was Bavaria, today it's Rhineland-Palatinate
One of those pesky, unruly small additions to our estate that escaped our warm embrace
But yes, I had Trumps arrogance in mind when I wrote that, thought it would be funny
Bavarian arrogance is sometimes pretty bad but not Trump bad
Nonono, that can not be
We are the chosen ones
Yeah I did that Badenser mistake before
*staring angrily over the garden fence and clenching my fist*
There is no country in this world where there is no nationalistic groups
How could you not agree
> But tbf Saxony is the economically strongest region in east Germany
Not per capita
But that is Berlin so maybe a bit unfair
Yeah it's a lot of beer
But, recently I read that Czech and Austrians would drink even more and couldn't believe it
Then I was in Vienna for the first time in a long time, a few weeks ago
Holy shit they drink a lot of beer everywhere and every time of the day
And it's all cans
Palatinate can have the Trump blame then, for what I care
At the same time they and FW are ranting about the greens for it
I'm longing for a time when Bavaria won't be governed by some random grandpas and countryside shitkickers
We have a ski resort consisting of two mountains, the Waldkopf (= Forest Mountain) and the Sudelfeldkopf (= Sudelfeld Mountain, Sudelfeld doesn't mean anything relevant)
The Waldkopf has no trees while the Sudelfeldkopf has a forest (= Wald) on it
Even 20°C are warm here
We only have this in the highest summer from June to August
Currently we have about 0°C which is rather cold but it's gonna get even colder until I consider 0°C as warm
We have up to -20°C around here
(I live in Bavaria in the Alps)
I live in Munich
Only time i got in trouble was when i walked across a red light with a police officer on the other side of the street
Didnt even get a fine or anything
And i havent heard of anyone getting in trouble for crossing an empty road yet
Hey
I was born in Munich and raised 60km away
The only thing I would do at Oktoberfest is to play some games
And even that’s overpriced to hell
For the price of one liter of beer at Oktoberfest you can get a whole six pack elsewhere
Or even a “tragerl” if you are not to picky
Why should I go there for overpriced beer, way to crowded spaces and wasted Australians barfing on the little hill behind the tents and passing out
I could imagine to spend my time more cheaply and more fun
And not having to see and smell humanities buttcrack while doing so
Herrenchiemsee
The unfinished Versailles of the same guy who build Neuschwanstein
To get there you’ll get to have a lovely boat ride
Edit: you can also rent a electric boat afterwards and have fun on the water
Also
You can reach it nicely by train to prien
In Germany we do "Aristarchos" which would be similar to your swedish example of "Epikuros" instead of Epikouros since it's still pronounced "Aristarkos". So you're not alone with that, I guess
It happens though in later history
Someone mentioned Cristoforo Colombo who we call Christoph Kolumbus in German
Well, technically Austria didn't exist during WW2
But I agree regarding WW1
Well, it's not like Austria or Austrian politicians had any kind of influence after the Anschluss
Austria's territory only helped for a better strategic position
Decisions were still made by Hitler and his government in Berlin
Austria surely did it's part, but it's not comparable with Germany's role in WW2 at all
We would be occupied
Germany was occupied by the French in the coalition wars and then freed itself in 1815
Then it lost WWI and became a democracy which was abused by a certain Austrian man with ugly mustache
From 1945 to 1949 Germany was occupied by France, the UK and US and the USSR
from 1949 to the early 1990s Germany was partly-sovereign
Paris
Nothing wrong with the city, it’s just overrated
Yeah favoriten and fünfhaus are the exact opposites of posh haha
Yeah I agree
I live in Munich
But also, I think if you know the right spots and people, night life can be pretty nice
Im by no means an expert but id say ottakring is ok
It has a significant yugoslavian population and yugo party scene
But id say despite the party scene which usually is more of an indicator for a crappy area, ottakring is decent
Better than favoriten and fünfhaus
Then again ottakring borders fünfhaus so if he lives at the border its probably bad
Id say as long as you dont live near the clubs and bars and the border to fünfhaus youre fine
It depends on your age i'd say
For my age the English Garden and the Isar are some really nice spots to party and hang out
No, I didn't hear anything in the news
Even when I google it I can't find anything
I doubt that
European monarchs barely have power anymore, this includes forming a new country just because of marriage
Any reason why you specifically picked Austria as an example
Sure, I just thought there was a story behind it
Or is Austria famous for having many local brewers in Denmark
Yes I would
But I think there has to be some restrictions for it
I would say that EU/EEA citizens who had their primary residence here for a while should be able to vote in the country they live in
The time is debatable
I would say maybe 5 or 10 years
Edit: I have much bigger problems with people voting in a countries election they don’t live in
They don’t have to bear the consequences
For example we have many Turkish citizens in Germany that vote for erdogan to take away liberties and human rights
But they don’t have to give up those liberties and rights because they live in Germany
What borders
The Hitlerputsch
1923 Hitler started a run with his followers through Munich
The intention was to plunder the weapon chamber of Munich and then run to Berlin to take over Germany
This didn't work and he was brought into jail for a year or so
Not in the Sense you are Talking about
But the state of Bavaria was Adolph Hitlers sole heir
His personal flat in now a police department
They also held the rights to „Mein Kampf“ until the copyright expired recently
That’s why they could prevent distribution in other countries for decades
Upper Franconia, Middle Franconia, Lower Franconia
Well tbf berlin is very cheap for a major european capital
Even compared to other german cities its cheap
What's that
Holy shit
In Germany (at least where I live) everyone can be friends with everyone
We had a cooking projevt in which every class cooked one week per year for every other class
[Link]
But tbh it was more of a 'learn to cut potatoes' than a 'learn to cook' project
25 minute car ride or about an hour with public transport, if there aren't any problems with that
I used to defend our public transport and if it reliably only took an hour I would still take it but it already cost me so much more lifetime and almost exactly the same money than going by car
In winter every week there is at least one train delayed so it might take up to 2 hours one way
Sometimes it really depressed me how much time I lost sitting on that stupid train not moving for half an hour when I should already have been at home for 10 minutes
So now I'm guilty of using the car, widening my environmental footprint but being already at home when the train just left the place where I work
I get up at the time I automatically wake up
I check if any interesting lectures happen at university
If there are interesting lectures:
I check if I have other plans, if not, I make me a coffee, shower myself and go there
If there aren't any interesting lectures:
I stay in bed and browse reddit
I went to Arizona and when I drove into a town they had a sign telling the visitors what kind of stores there are
On the bottom of that sign was written "Wir haben eine Backerei" (We have a bakery) in German
I have no idea why and I wasn't able to find this bakery
Also I went to Spain and tgere was "Schorschs Bierstubn" which is the Bavarian expression of a restaurant where you can drink beer
Schorsch is the Bavarian form for George
The houses I grew up in in Bavaria where all heated with woodstoves and I remember cutting up wood and stacking it around the house in the late summer and fall
One house we had for rent even "came with" a small plot of land on a nearby mountain to cut trees for that, since there is no such thing as "cutting firewood on public land" in Germany
There is licences needed and stuff
Most people that heat with firewood buy it already cut or in whole trees from rangers/the woodworkers the rangers employ or people that own bigger plots of land in the woods
The house I'm living in right now is heated primarily by oil furnaces in each of the flats
It's pretty old and that is not common at all in Germany
My neighbour below has both, an oil furnace and woodstove
In newer houses woodstoves are more a luxury item additional to central heating
People like the look of it and the smell of the burning wood (me too)
BJÖRN
MEIN NAME IST BJÖRN HÖCKE
That actually happened nearby where I live
I was really shocked
Can relate, I've been living in Munich for nine years
I hate: Being called a Nazi
I love: Being associated with Lederhosen and beer
Oarchkatzlschwoaf
It's Bavarian for the tail of a squirrel
Well we're the country of board games
So while there is of course
stuff like "Nine men's morris" (Mühle), Backgammon, Checkers
that people know almost everywhere,
we also invented the "Mensch ärgere dich nicht" variant of cross and circle games and a lot of modern classics like Catan and Carcassonne
And I think most Germans have at least seen these
In the international board game community German board games are still known for quality up until today
Especially among fans of low randomness, trading and worker placement mechanics and high attention on a setting interwoven with the game mechanics
The German "Spiel des Jahres" award for board games is recognized as a seal of quality, much to my delight hearing non-Germans trying to pronounce "Spiel des Jahres".
So maybe we're not that strong on cultilvating a board game tradition with very old games, but probably we are one of the strongest "players" of modern board gaming
Österreich-Ungarn
The Swedish invasion of Bavaria ain’t bad either
And you bloody bastards never crossed the river Inn
Dammn right neighbor
Inglourious Basterds
Corelahmee
We have officially:
German, Sorbic, Frisian, Danish and Romanes
Unofficially there's spoken a Dutch-similar-sounding German dialect "Plattdeutsch".
There are a lot more dialects whose speakers sometimes can't be understood by people from other regions
The dialect on the other side of the river can be completely different than your's.
In the Hesse constitution death penalty is still allowed
It can't be used though because federal law of Germany breaks states' law
I finished school this year and I did arab spring and Germany's reunion
Maybe depends on the German state you're finishing school in
For menit was Bavaria
I was told that Bavaria has the highest level of all a levels in Germany
Babelsberg (near Berlin)
Bavaria Filmstudios (near Munich)
And Henry is Heinrich
East Germany is way more beautiful than everyone thinks
I went there (Saxony/Berlin) a few years ago for the first time and I was surprised how beautiful the old cities (as Dresden, Leipzig etc) are
Of course, because of the lots of people who flew after the border was opened, the smaller towns are rather empty and neglected
The nature is wonderful anyways
It depends
Generally it’s higher than in Eastern Europe
But there are tricks
First of, for regional trains almost every Bundesland has so called “Ländertickets”. They allow you to take every regional train in this Bundesland on this day
And most of the time busses, trams and U-Bahn are included
There is also such a ticket available for the whole of Germany, but in those the city traffic may not be included
For long distance trains you should buy in advance
There you can get quite cheap tickets
But those cheap tickets are limited to one specific train
Never buy on the day you want to travel
Also you could think about a BahnCard
This is a discount for tickets for 25% or 50%. If you plan to travel often by train, those can really be worth it
You have to inform yourself about the quirks and tricks to get the best prices, or else you pay more than you would need to
No, we tried that once
Didn't go too well
Also in Germany
Germany and Bavaria
None of them agree with that but it's true
Edit: I know Bavaria is part of the Federal Republic
This is actually so accurate lmao
We Germans love sausages haha
Ju dit vorgett se “se”. Sis is unaxeptabel
Ai ßink siss iss wärri isi

[Sooo cute]
Or simply our LoFi girl…
There's no actual danger, I hope
>	when everyone just sees her as „the pretty one“
That’s the same problem Merkel has to face till today
People often underestimate her cause she is so pretty…
Nope
We Germans are still the only ones with the right to start a WW
oh my fucking god
i got bamboozled
Look close to his face
He doesn’t look really older
>	he could be presiding over legislation that waters down environmental protection
WTF
He is from the Green Party
Stop spreading theoretical fake news
It’s always you Brits…
~~Yeah, but he is now under the main influence of Green/EFA
That’s his european party family
I meant with that that you’ve smeared him theoretically to make your point
As a result, many here will read this and unconsciously store your theoretical devaluation in the brain, although this is not true at all
Hey, we are usually only racist against Prussians
Tbf, a lot of people here got angry when the Greeks pictured Merkel as Hitler
>	where religion and race are synonymous
WTF
There is no Jewish race
My grandparents were convinced that this would be a thing
We all know the outcome
[Well]
So you mean… Germany… above everything else
Most of the EU polls are saying that we should kick out the UK…
The UK would veto a EU army
I am very happy that they are leaving - most of the EU leaders are
From the money perspective: Germany alone could have paid the British fees five times last year with its surplus
No one will miss their money, especially not Germany
We will
France already announced that there is no chance for the UK to stay in the EU…
Bozen exists
Valetta is also very nice
I like these „castle cities“.
Yeah, that is nice, too
However, most things were closed when we there
Also the church is really nice
And i am really ashamed that we Germans throw a bomb right in it
That’s absolutely disgusting
Ja, aus München
[Du schreibst schon echt gutes Deutsch

I would have liked a picture with no dress
They'd be easily worth two black women on the market of Algiers
Also the major is a little bit crazy
This sounds like a title from a satire news site
Haha
It’s this guy Martin Sonneborn is always talking about
He was his neighbour in the European Parliament…
He is famous in Germany, cause he is so absurd
Hey, nearly no other nation votes that sarcastically for the European Parliament as we Germans
Don’t forget that
It’s a serious election for the other nations…
I would never vote for them, too
But they are funny
They are punching up, look alone [here] I like them very much, but I am a member of another party
But they are doing a good job
Yeah, their graphic designer should be fired
They have a lot of stupid graphics for [this otherwise interesting survey]
Well, good
They should, fuck that
Well, it’s her birthday
So she is allowed
Well, it’s her birthday…
[Germany’s EU presidency]
Na, we don’t do that anymore…
Just the normal German [Möbius Strip]
I thought all regions of Schleswig-Holstein can also vote in the German federal elections
I mean, in Germany the influence of the AfD is nowadays lower than three years ago
Look alone the 180° change the CSU has made in the last two years…
Foreigners are often [a little bit confused] :)
>	imagine people are gathering for 64 days and wanting your resignation
Some people in east Germany demanding Merkel’s resignation since 2015 every day
Protests alone don’t legitimate claims
My little sisters school here in Munich changed the timetable so they will not miss school during those protests on Fridays
I've read somewhere that over 200k students all over Germany were protesting, could that be about right
Awesome
Wish I could have been there too
What's with the line on Russias Western border
Makes me feel ashamed of living in Germany
This kind of behavior is disgusting and cowardly
Violence against people using Nazi symbols is no different from other political violence
It shouldn't be a "very bad idea". I'm ashamed of being a German when it is actually dangerous to do any kind of salute here
Apparently we still have a long way to catch up in liberalism
Me, too
This was a disheartening thread to read
If those are Europeans, I don't want to be one anymore
They are part of the green group - at least in the European Parliament
Aren’t you guys the only east european country with a significant Green Party (the Pirates)
They are green
Grey doesn’t have many seats here…
Part of the European green group since years…
Christian Party was the most voted in the european election
Ah come on
Even east Germany is East Europe
^(We see you guys as the Bavarians of east Europe
We really like you
Why don’t you change your voting system
It’s ridiculous
Yeah, sorry
Here in Germany the EPP party (Merkel and von der Leyen) is called „Christian Democratic Union“. And their counterpart here in Bavaria is called „Christian Social Union“.
But they should change their name
Many Christians like nuns and priests voted currently for the Green Party and demonstrated against the conservatives
Everyone got firstname lastname and biden is just there like "hello im President"
vdL attended a meeting of the 16 German state prime ministers last Friday
Merkel is also often there
You can bring guests to such meetings, why not
Merkel even [attended a (fancy) meeting of the Bavarian Government last year] Unusual, of course
But if another head of state would like to attend a meeting there, what are the points against this
It’s normal for German governments, federal or state, to invite leaders of other governments to their meetings
I am very sure this was an idea from Merkel or vdL
(Usually it’s really boring for the foreign leaders to be there
They don’t care about 95% of the issues
But it’s a German Tradition
Germany has opposed the Iraq war
Also stayed neutral during the Libyan war
Tbf, it was a bit funny
Im glad the US has now a leader where we can make harmless jokes about him like this
The last years have been a complete shitshow
Back then, when the CSU was more to the right, even Orban has attended once a meeting of the Bavarian government
At least in Germany this is not that unusual to do
Maybe it was the idea of Merkel or vdL ^((BTW: it’s always a lower case „v“. „von“ is always lower case in German)
The EU is a … ~~German~~ ~~Austrian~~ French (thanks god) idea
The intro of the German army podcast I’m listening to starts with the line of our former green foreign minister: „I’m not convinced“. That was back then at the Munich Security Conference to the US defence minister
It’s a powerful quote in my opinion
Yeah, the MSC in that year was very wild
Well, we have sent soldiers to Kosovo, and they are there until today
It was the right thing to do, but we couldn’t get an UN-Mandate
Afghanistan has not been an illegal war
That’s very legal compared to the others
Most of Austrian is very similar to Bavarian
Personally, I like the Viennese accent very much and the Tyrolean accent is thick but warm
And then there is the accent of Vorarlberg, that is Alemannic and therefore a bit strange
Sorry Penislord321, it was not my intention to hurt your feelings
She and the whole federal govt deserve credit, but also the Prime Ministers and Ministers of the German states, who hold the direct political power, because without good coordination between federal and state level nothing would work out
Look at other federal republics, like the US, where one part of the country is in lockdown, while on part of the country protests against lockdowns and completely misses the point
We can be very glad everyone is working together
We Germans have the most boring leader and you guys have the most … interesting leader
Tbh, talking in front of the public is really not her strength
Where are you from
Most of Germans like her very much - but would never vote for her party
(Stupid autocorrection made in front to infringement)
But he has no chance to get a relevant job other then MP
But some are saying in the end he is since a year the real health minister: [Der Professor und sein Minister  ]
Merkel is the last name of her first husband
So she also know the emotional side of having a divorce ;)
Of course
Everyone lost track how often our last chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, has been married…
Well, she has studied physics but has a PhD in quantum chemistry
So both is right
Oh, that’s a cute name
How did that go down
When did he have the time to cut two people's heads off
> why isn't this said more often to these extremists
What kind of dumbass question is that
How often do you listen in to conversation with "extremists"?
Radical Islam as opposed to uncool Islam
If you don't "tolerate intolerance" you are not a liberal democracy
> Liberties are only worth it if you've got security
I'd rather have a pacified country, with strict rules
What kind of abominable pussy are you
You give up your freedoms without even being threatened by anything
What in the world are you talking about
"Giving a soft pass"?!
There is absolutely nothing that can stop a person from stabbing others
Do you want to outlaw knives
Slovakia also doesn't recognize cardiac arrest as an emergency and hence no one dies from it there
What kind of fucking idiot are you
There is two terrorist attacks and you think you aren't safe
That's not a political problem
That's a problem with you being a piss poor statistician
And in German the wannabe-Nazis just said in the Bundestag that transporting children by bike should be banned
Only transporting them by car should be allowed
I’ve thought that a woman is beautiful and a man is handsome - and both mean the same
Isnt that the case
Yeah, I got this after my comment
Karajan or Furtwängler
Just get rid of speed limits on highways
That stuff is so stupid
So in Germany that would be everyone below 200 km/h?
>	It’s about people endangering others‘ lives
Yeah, That’s why the German Autobahn is so dangerous
Why should a speed limit make a highway safer
You wrote:
>	It's about people endangering others' lives
High speed on the highway is not „endangering others lives“ - otherwise the German Autobahn must be really dangerous
It isnt
It’s really safe to drive in Germany compared to places with speed limits on highways
So speed limits are solving exactly nothing
It’s a thread about speed limits in /r/Europe
So Germany is not part of Europe anymore
Its the feeling of disappointment
The old FDP was the greatest party Germany has had
So many impressive people have been members of this party
But they are sadly now only shadows of this greatness and have betrayed the liberal German society for reducing this party mostly to a *big company* party
They still have few great people in the federal parliament, but in the states they are often more right wing than the conservatives nowadays, often appeasing the AFD
This evolution is really sad
Some of them are *really* good people
Like Agnes-Marie Strack-Zimmermann and Konstantin Kuhle
But sadly not the current party leadership
Sadly
But luckily only on weekends…
An article about her family gets harassed and your first respond is „her parents are so fucking awful“. Well done
I have never seen that someone is going after e.g. Merkels husband…
Ah, of course some one of east Europe is posting such things
First Merkel, now Greta
It’s about her little sister…
Why is she going after the city of Hamburg
More of [this]
She is one of the most world wide hated person by the far-right and the far-left…
Here in the Munich area most villages have switched to geothermal district heating
But we are very lucky, nearly no where else in Germany is it safe to have geothermal power plants
Otherwise we couldn’t see the old lady, could we
Most of them, but they have also a few good ones
She is not a reporter, she is one of the protestors (and the Secretary General of the German liberals)
That’s cultural appropriation
That’s a 100% German thing
There are also Greens from Bavaria ;)
So, /r/Polandball but as Yaoi
i like it
Who isn’t hot in this picture
That’s the magic of Yaoi
Hmm
The most confusing thing is:
Yaoi is something like gay hentai, but in some way it isn’t. It’s mostly consumed by Japanese *straight* woman
Gays mostly prefer Bara
So even if this „Yaoi thing“ is kinda gay, the real people this is for are straight women - not gay dudes
It’s a bit funny
Yeah, I wonder if lesbians like the „lesbian porn“ that is made for straight guys
If I go from this example here (straight women like it but gay men not so much), I’ve some doubts…
So lesbians and gays can agree on straight porn
Not for them
Same here
But I’ve to admit they are a bit annoying at the gay hentai websites
Women with a dick are still something for guys who like women
Why the hell are traps in our category
They are women (with dicks)
why should any gay man be attracted to them
Same here :)
I don't think you know what devil's advocate means
As one [German newspaper] wrote:
>	*EU decides something important with many billions, which nobody understands*
>	Brussels (dpo) - Good news or perhaps bad news from Brussels
The heads of government of the EU member states have today decided on something complicated, involving billions of euros, which nobody really understands
>	According to most observers, the decision was about 750 billion euros or even a higher amount to be distributed or something
Or it is only this amount that is guaranteed, but in the end the money does not actually flow at all, right
Or does it
In any case, that has finally been decided
>	Apparently, the vote is a milestone of historical significance
At least one has to assume so, because the politicians involved were all very excited and according to media reports debated longer than usual
Furthermore, all those involved stress that this is a milestone of historical significance
>	As with almost all decisions in Brussels, it is to be assumed that the individual EU citizen will not actually feel any concrete effects in the end, but is nevertheless firmly convinced that he or she has been taken for a ride
I know, Norway is not in the EU, but I just imagined [Merkel and Solberg] taking secretly cocaine at the toilet together ;)
As is tradition
Ask Poland
You have to exaggerate and after some years you can slowly reduce it to one single main element and then suddenly something like [this] is enough
Where is the Vatican
The same way that Kosovo can use the Euro despite not being in the Eurozone: Noone can be bothered
You never know
Right, I didn't know that
Does San Marino have an agreement regarding open borders
What
Talk to my railway station
A railway facility where trains regularly stop to load or unload passengers and/or freight
Eh aren’t you using your own language then
Or at least your own dialect instead of using Bavarian
Because it would be pointless to have empty trains running around without passengers and freight
Exactly
I don’t understand railway stations when I speak to them
Do you
Well, isn’t in some way 180° up also flat
Keep in mind, these EU numbers are not the whole European numbers
If you would include also the UK and Russia it would be even higher
Why
The EU has more people than the US and the UK has far less people
Also the UK isn’t included in the EU numbers
[Naja]
Merkel was so frustrated two days ago
She wanted strict rules in whole Germany but some Prime Ministers didn’t want that
It’s so stupid that the federal government cannot do anything in this pandemic
The USA has nearly as many ICU beds per capita as Germany
That are good numbers
Many European nations like the UK are [way below that]
How much of a fault has your health care system in this high death rate
Or seems you guys don’t have much ICU beds
Then go with [the German numbers] instead of the UK numbers
Iconic
Same in German
Marriage is for masochists
Hitler ignores the restrictions placed on Germany
That's ok
Hitler abolishes democracy in Germany
That's ok
He just wants peace and a strong people
Hitler takes Austria
That's ok
He'll be contempt and he only wants peace
...
It took the Brits an eternity to realize that yielding to Hitler didn't make him stop
Now we see the same attitude towards Putin: The loudest voices all accuse the West of not yielding enough
I'm not a psychologist, but that seems very foolish
If we don't resist now, the costs of resisting will only increase
Yeah, but the press is already pounding on the EU for just allowing the Ukraine to *maybe* join at some point in the future
Imagine the backlash they'd get from actually helping it's citizens against the Russians
In my idealistic vision of the Union it would defend people everywhere, but we're far from that
>It did work with Hitler until the allies declared war on him when he attack Poland
If you don't see how self defeating that sentence is, you must be retarded
This doesn't even need an argument, you said it yourself: Hitler attacked Poland
Therefore appeasement **didn't work**.
What major problems
They don't have a war within or a famine or anything like that
Also the EU is not supposed to just fill the pockets of entrepreneurs, but also to defend liberal democracy
And I think we should push it to fulfil that promise
Even if it was harsh, that's hardly something the Germans should complain about, because what they'd have done with France would have been much worse
It's as close as you can get to a war between Gandalf and Sauron in the real world
Of course the Allies were not purely dedicated to human flourishing in all their decisions in the world, but the aggression in the war came *entirely* from the fascists and monarchists and their defeat was a big step forward for humanity
You'd live in a very different world if the fascists had won and you should be grateful for not knowing that world
I guess if everyone in front of you kills themselves before you can, you are not technically be at war
Since you insist that everything be yielded to the fascists and their terror be unanswered, I guess you agree with them
Would you feel that it is wise to unconditionally yield to an aggressive liberal democracy
It is ludicrous that the EU should be pushed around by Russia at all
That's like a sparrow telling an eagle where it may or may not fly
that upside down flag though lol
Ein Reichsbürger
Just go to the Oktoberfest…
makes sense
A broomstick parade…
outstanding move
What is meant with "the holocaust happened" here
That the Nazis intended to exterminate the Jews in Europe
Or what were they asked
Were the people of 2004 asked the same question as the ones in 2020
This is really weird to me
Yeah I want to know where this is from and what questions they asked exactly
That's really surprising to me
I don't think the actual genocide is the worst part of what the Nazis did, but there is a recording of Himmler directly stating their intention to eradicate the Jews in Europe - perhaps that should be more widely known
Curious
If the holocaust happened, how come they are still alive
Checkmate
The West in general has a huge problem with Islamophilia
It's the perfect combination, a religion (protection+), perceived minority (protection+) and tension from Islamic terrorism (protection+)
Leftism blends into anti-Americanism, "anti-imperialism", which is adjacent to anti-semitism
I have never met a boomer that wasn't super anti-fascist
Found the Zeit-Podcast listener
And have no real borders there cause Austria has its own rule about it, Switzerland has its own rule and Germany is just saying: ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Oh, there was last week a podcast about european sausages
So I thought … nevermind
*sorts by controversial*
I think they used the graph from last time and just changed the numbers
But that’s really not acceptable for the ARD, they are not a private news agency
However, in their [PDF] to this study they used the right proportions…
>	I will now name a few countries and please tell me whether the respective country is a partner for Germany that can be trusted or not
This was the exact question
To be honest, after snowden the us numbers were similar…
The UK had since recently always high numbers in this poll - even after they decided to leave
[Have a look]
Thanks a lot for your work
Sadly I am lacking the skills to validate their or your work, but I just trust you on this
If you enjoy to make validations I would ask you if you could quickly check if they also messed the graph up in their official [PDF]
ARD is usually not known for doing this - they are usually seen as the most thrustful news in Germany
That’s the reason why every German here is really pissed
When I wrote similar I thought more on the peak in 2009
compared to then it’s similar
But you are of course right
>	Ich nenne Ihnen jetzt einige Länder und Sie sagen mir bitte, ob das jeweilige Land ein Partner für Deutschland ist, dem man vertrauen kann oder nicht
>	(I will now name a few countries and please tell me whether the respective country is a partner for Germany that can be trusted or not
The question was specifically for Germany alone
Putin usually does not order assassinations on German people…
Lol reddit has the most inane discussions ever
That's not what globalism means
So "globalism is when you don't hate foreigners" is the same as "letting global superpowers take over instead"?
Next time name Bavaria not just Germany, but Prussia
It gets not more offensive
Well, we do actually like BaWu like no other German state
So I am not that offended
Prussia would be much more insulting
Why is there the German foreign minister in the background
Ugh, that’s horrible
Maybe we should make Kosovo an EU member state
They are paying something via the EU (until the end of this year)
Yeah, but first we should cut off the F4 from the EU budget so we are able to do such things
Otherwise they would veto it
We even have negative interest rates
Investors are willing to lose some of their money for the possibility to give it to the German government
I understand why but it’s also a little bit crazy
Why not
Money is not an relevant thing in German politics anymore since years with negative interest rates
But it seems it’s relevant for other nations, they even have to pay interest rates by their own if they want money, instead of getting money for taking money
So we give them some of our money and making profit with it
Nope, the F4
its not like the V4 an old and official group
They created themselves unofficial in the beginning of this year as the so called „frugal four“:
-	Sebastian Kurz, chancellor of Austria
-	Mette Frederiksen, prime minister of Denmark
-	Mark Rutte, prime minister of the Netherlands
-	Stefan Lofven, prime minister of Sweden
But unlike the V4 it’s not the nations who build this group, it’s just those four people
So it’s a little bit like a cheap western - and Frederiksen has already left this group today
You can't leave one of the biggest markets, who is also nearest to you, and expect business to beg you to build in your country
He should have said that they have chosen Germany cause it’s strong and stable
You are really nice and good looking people :)
He has chosen high taxes, high wages, powerful unions, many public holidays an a very difficult legal situation to fire a worker
Europe wide supply chain
It’s a big shock that he will make cars in Germany
That’s very unusual here
Emotional and bitter
Why can't it have been a competitor
eg Heathrow
Wenn deinen Mutter nicht in das Schwimmbecken gesprungen wäre, dann hätte die ESA heute auf dem Mars kein Wasser gefunden
lol Brazil
Greater Bavaria*
I'm 100% sure Elizabeth will make it to #1
Only if France is also allowed in
But including the Baltics
lol this is the funniest sad shit I've seen in a while
So should we be allowed to deny the Holocaust just because Nazi Germany was "technically" a different country than the Federal Republic
Could also be foreigners visiting Munich during Oktoberfest
They are wearing [weird things]
We could avoid so many discussions about this issue if we would just introduce a new term like this funny „Middle Europe“.
Go Belgium
Looks a bit like Valetta
Yes, German experts [have confirmed this] already last week:
>	*Experts give the all-clear: people do not get infected with Corona when they demonstrate for a good cause*
>	Berlin, Munich (dpo) - Is there a threat of a new corona wave after the Black Lives Matter demos with over 100,000 participants nationwide over the weekend
In view of the failure to observe safety distances in some of the demonstrations, researchers have investigated the issue and can now give the all-clear:  Fortunately, people do not get infected with Corona when they demonstrate for a good cause
>	"The corona virus may be a deadly virus, but it also has principles," explains virologist Heike Theis of the Berlin Charité hospital
"It's looking very closely at what is being demonstrated for
When it comes to fabulously stupid concerns such as protesting against compulsory vaccination, the chipping of citizens by Bill Gates or an imaginary "re-population", the virus infects as many as possible
However, if the occasion of the demonstration is a good thing, the virus respects this and deliberately holds back".
>	Another factor could also be that, in contrast to the Hildmann Naidoo hygiene demos, at least the majority of the demonstrators wore protective masks and in many cities the protests were designed as "silent demos".
>	In addition, it was possible that at least during the demonstration against police violence in Hamburg, the water cannons subsequently used by the police simply washed away any corona viruses - valuable help that the participants in the hygiene demonstrations did not have

You are aware that there is no EU wide plan
Not even in every EU member state is a *nation* wide plan
For example, Germany has nearly the exact same situation like the USA - every of the 16 German states is doing what they want
The federal government is all the time just trying to coordinate, but not always that successful
The federal level can’t do anything - let alone the EU level
Same here with this outlet
We have an old satirical magazine („Titanic“) and they have even two MEPs in the European Parliament (don’t ask why)
But the magazine is old and not that good anymore
This „Postillion“ is young and much better
Mate, I have acknowledged the US situation and just said that we have a similar situation in Germany
Thuringia is now getting rid of fucking *all* corona policies while Bavaria remains very strict
I don’t get it while you think I have done the opposite and am saying that „all of the US is just one thing“.
Really
Not even in the cinema or public transportation
They have founded their own party („[The Party]
And since Germany is one single constituency in the European elections and we have 96 seats and no percentage threshold you actually don’t need that much percent for a seat
That’s the reason why there have been 41 different parties at the ballot paper
They won nearly 900,000 votes or 2
4% of the German total, thus winning two seats
Was really close to three seats
Interesting
One German state, Thuringia, has also abolished *all* mandatory Corona policies
It will be very interesting how their numbers will be in one or two weeks
Well, there are plenty of studies out there saying the opposite
But if it’s working for you, then I’m happy for you
>	but if it makes you feel good
Well, that’s something :)
oh, it looks like a sad, little condom :(
~~Wtf
We have official *Marx Year* here in Germany
Even the Federal government pays tribute to him, also the CEOs of the big capitalistic companies
Do you even know what Marx wrote
I'm apparently stupid
Fuck, sorry, that’s what ITT means
Didn’t know that, I thought he equated Marxists with neo-Nazis
Shame one me
Bavaria legalised it in 1811…
The entire Balkan peninsula and some American college students with coloured hair will heavily disagree with that sentiment
That’s why Google just gave up
Back then so many Germans demanded Google to blur their house that google simply gave up

She's one of the most corrupt politicians in all of europe, heavily into censorship and overt nepotism
She kept massively overpaying "consultants" from either her personal friends or her family in every office she's ever held in germany, and iirc was one of the main targets of corporate lobbying in the Bundestag
This post is trying to make her look like your cozy family mother
It is blatant political propaganda
Gift this man a trip to America
Do the countries who will have female monarchs no male-preference succession or are they just the only children the current monarch has and could get moved back if they get a brother

The most important German news magazine once used an [incorrect German flag] It’s only three colours, it’s not that hard
So yeah, sometimes we have the same here…
Well, *some* things have changed in the last 48 hours
There is no leadership battle inside the SPD
They have announced their „candidate“ months ago
But the social democrats have archived everything they have wanted in Germany over the last 100 years
Nowadays they don’t know what they want additionally
So other parties are now more relevant
And what other of this six parties is a factual ecologist in your opinion
Same as the other four major parties
Except the AfD every party is anti-nuclear
Germany has been destroyed two times in the last century
But yeah, having a green chancellor is much worse, I get you
Greens polled worse in the latest EU election than their actual result was
Yeah, cause the current conservatives-liberal government in NRW is doing such a great job
Thats an non-issue in this elections
No one is going to talk about nuclear energy
Schulz’ polling success was based on his personality
That’s not the case with ACAB
Also strongest party in Munich
Yeah, I’ll feel free
As a supporter of the greens my fear is that they will fuck it up (again) in the next months, not that the polls are wrong
But then again the current leadership hasn’t fucked up an election so far
It’s good to be more Realo than Fundi
Well, this is simply the first poll after all the things that have happened in the last 48 hours
-	ACAB was nominated by the Greens
-	Laschet was nominated by the conservatives
I think Latvia has the highest ratio of women to men in the world

The 17th Bundesland
Catalonia and Scotland, but no Bavaria
:-/
Bavaria is a country, too
There is nothing that makes Scotland special in any way compared to Bavaria
Bavaria is its own free state with its own constitution
It depends on your definition of the term "country". It can mean "sovereign state", but then Scotland isn't a country either
The official term for the 16 German "states" is "Länder" (singular "Land") which translates directly to "country".
No one recognise them as country
Only UK
BTW: has Schottland at least it’s own constitution
What do you think is the translation of „Länder“?
Mate, I’ve no negative feelings about Scotland at all
But when you look at the facts then many regions in Europe including Bavaria have more  characteristics of a nation then Scotland has
We call ourselves „free state“, you call yourselves „nation“. But that are just names, doesn’t mean anything in both cases
Oh, it’s the German quotes
They are also used in Austria, but funnily not in Switzerland (they also don’t use the letter „ß“ (double s))

Yeah, nations with a lots of embassies often serve as a secondary embassy for other nations
For example Switzerland is doing this for the USA in Iran
It’s not even really the same inside a nation
Like for example back then India gave out 3-months tourist visas for Germans, but in the consulate in Munich Bavarians could get a six-months visa
There are so many different statistics for this, it’s really confusing

Fact is: Viennese is the most beautiful dialect, by far
What other dialect is able to compete in your opinion
Even most Swiss dialects are better then German Swabian
At least Salzburg could come back to Bavaria…

G7 Summit conclusion:

They don’t need a button or something
I can’t open your link, but when you are not accepting their terms - or parts of it - they are free to make no deals with you and kick you out of their websites
So giving you something free when you’re accepting all the terms should be legal, I think
Here in Germany Dunkirk doesn’t matter at all
We mostly learn nearly nothing about the participation of the UK in WW2
Its all the time the Russians, continental Europe and in the end the US…
We don't cover WW2 in general lol
The Nazi Regime, sure, the Holocaust, the Ideology, the Propaganda, even the economy, all in great detail
But the War itself is on the clear backburner
Well, some countries are thinking that the UK was basically unimportant in WW2…
We learn about the important nations
Russia, France and the USA…
I didn’t say that it is true
Just mentioned how our teachers are seeing it
That’s the reason why in Germany there is often a confusion why the Brits are so focused on WW2, cause we often wondering ourselves “did they even participate
Jep, my grandfather was in Stalingrad…
If this reality makes you happy, then keep it

As usual Germany
Germany will close many coal plants in 2021 - together with the last remaining nuclear power plants
Are there similar plans in Poland for coal power plants
It’s illegal to eat Weißwurst after 12, so that sounds not that bad…
Even many German greens regretting nowadays the order of the two phase outs
But it’s to late to change it now
But non of them will replaced with gas power plants but with renewables
Häresie
>	gas lobby group Zukunft Erdgas said on Wednesday
Not your ass, but out of their ass
And i am not arguing with you that nuclear is better for the climate then gas
That’s true
But the phase out was a decision made in 1999/2000
Sadly the zeitgeist in Germany at that time was not focusing on the climate…

Even Sanders claims that he is a socialist
Stupid
Hehe, these Icelandic numbers are always funny
Why am I part of the problem
I live on the other side of the planet
Does he
As far as I know he is always saying „democratic socialist“ - while in fact his ideas would rather qualify him as social democrat
Well, for their standards even the CSU would be a socialist party…
Then why calling yourself a socialist at the first place
I mean, Bavaria has the most social programs of all German states
Typical for a Christian *Social* Union
With all respect - I don’t think he has so much time left ;)

If it is true what people here are saying he has quite a history
There is a nice Icelandic novel about this issue
It called „Rökkurbýsnir“ (From the Mouth of the Whale) - with the most powerful first three pages I have ever read
Bombastic Prologue
-	Author: Sjón
-	Title (in English): From the Mouth of the Whale
-	Year: 2008
The Title is really strange, it’s completely different in English (From the Mouth of the Whale) , German (The Glistering of the Night) or Icelandic (The Demons of Darkness)
I have no clue why they changed the title so much in different languages
So maybe in Hungarian it will be again a totally different title
But Sjón only published one book in 2008, so it should be possible to find it
WTF
This is great :)
Everyone here really likes the Irish at the moment

Without Brexit there would be no PESCO and all the other discussions about further EU integration
I am very happy that the UK is leaving…
Yeah, I think we should not punish the UK but helping them by giving them a good trade deal
I would be in favour of creating two EUs: one less political integrated but economically very integrated
And one that could do the real hot shit, like building a European Federation
The UK and others like Hungary could join the economic Union without worrying that it would took away their “sovereignty“ and we others could build the real Europe
