But the “UK” part is literally necessary to describe the state

Unfortunately It is the United Kingdom of Great Britain *and Northern Ireland*.  People in NI are forgotten about enough as it is

Technically, actually the only way, the Secretary of State for NI (British minister) has to call a poll on the issue and she's resisting calls to do so

There is no recent data on that, not even recent census data if you want to be crude and assume people would vote along religious lines
Things are very different with the Brexit situation, moderate unionists are more open to the idea of being in a united Ireland and inside the EU than left as part of the UK, outside it

Foreign country
We are talking about people living on the island of Ireland and the jurisdictional boundaries changing
They aren't moving islands
Might also want to consider this:

What year are you living in man
You mean the Irish people who live in the north of the island who are guaranteed a vote on the issue
Or the unionists who would be happy to British citizens living in a united Ireland and inside the EU
These people in your mind are 'violent nationalists'?
Not the loyalist death squads who [attack police and political parties] when a British Union flag is voted to be removed from Belfast city hall
They sound like violent British nationalists to me
To recap
You said:
>Its not up to England to decide
I said:
>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (British minister) makes the call
It's up to a minister from the British government in England - how is that what you said
> there's still a lot of people who want to remain in the UK
Indeed but the poll doesn't need a huge majority in favour or against, it is 50+1
"Polling of Northern Ireland residents by LucidTalk in December found that - in the event of a so-called hard Brexit with no deal on the border, the Good Friday agreement or citizens’ rights - support for remaining in the EU through reunification with the Republic was marginally greater (48%) than support for staying in the UK (45%)"
I can only see support going up further once Brexit strikes
>The only benefit to having a border poll is having a serious discussion on what a united Ireland might look like
The serious discussion is already happening and has been for quite some time
For example
here's [Sinn Fein's plan for a national health service] for the entire island - from 2017
> I was just pointing out
Yes, but you were claiming the majority want to remain part of the UK without any evidence of that
>that there's a clearly defined mechanism in place for NI to leave if there's a call for it,
The clearly defined mechanism begins when the British minister (NI Sec of State) decides to call a border poll
Not up to the people
>the country isn't being held against its will
Well it is if the majority want a united Ireland and the British minister won't call a poll
>Brexit represents the first realistic chance of a majority voting to join the ROI so I wouldn't be surprised if there's a border poll in the next few years
Agreed
>A year in which dissident republicans set off a bomb in NI
Which was something out of the blue and representative of who/what exactly
About 20 people in Derry
You have classed everyone in favour of a united Ireland as 'violent nationalists' whose democratic decision, if made, would be "appeasement".
You can point out some pathetic firebomb put outside a court as evidence of this but it is extremely weak and dishonest
Ok, I see you can't explain how the two different statements are the same
>England =/= Britain
And
It is a minister from Theresa May's cabinet
It's certainly not up to the people or government officials from  Scotland or Wales to decide is it
Or anyone from the island of Ireland
>As to 'democratic decision' when did that enter the equation
1918
>The republicans have never been interested in democracy
Go read about the [1918 all-Ireland election] - you know prior to partition of the island
That historic democratic vote throughout the island was a landslide win for Sinn Fein but was ignored, conflict ensued and partition imposed
Edit: Here's some democracy trivia for you
>There was no doubt Sinn Féin was the big winner outside of Ulster, taking 62 of the 64 seats in the other three provinces
That included all thirteen seats in Connaught, where de Valera trounced James Dillon in the constituency that Dillon had represented for 33 years
de Valera won by almost two-to-one, with 8,975 votes to Dillon’s 4,513
>Sinn Féin’s winners included [Madame Markievicz] who comfortably won her contest in Dublin, thus becoming the first woman ever elected to the British Parliament
She was actually the only woman elected in that general election in which women first got the vote
Yes, Republicans were so disinterested in democracy that one of their candidates, an English woman, was the first woman ever to be elected to British Parliament
>Republicans win a referendum
That's your problem you think anyone in favour of a united Ireland is a republican and previously you called them 'a bunch of violent nationalists'. Your bitterness is showing
>, fair enough, but handing NI over to RoI without the consent of its people would be appeasement of those who prefer bombs to ballots
Nobody mentioned handing over without consent
That's the whole point of a referendum
The whole point of the Good Friday Agreement
You'd prefer to drag us backwards and rattle on about republicans in ignorant bliss that most violence, criminality and terrorism is being carried out by loyalist death squads who are nothing more than a collection of gangsters and thugs
The IRA has gone
The war is over
Get over it
>They were never brought to justice
I wonder why
maybe this post will help
But first, for those confused
this is about the Real IRA or more accurately the so-called Real IRA
Definitely
#NOT THE IRA
Officially known as Provisional IRA but more commonly and internationally known as just the IRA
This is about the so-called 'REAL IRA' not the actual IRA but nice job by the OP of conflating the two
The difference in the two groups is vast and the difference does matter
I know that's hard for many to accept
The post is now in the r/ireland sub, r/northernireland sub and r/europe
probably more - all with the misleading 'IRA'. What's the purpose here
To rewrite history
Here's why it matters
The IRA was a "professional, dedicated, highly skilled and resilient force". That's not me sayimg that but their enemy, the British army
Here you go
This was not the work of a professional, dedicated, highly skilled and resilient force, it was the work of a bunch of idiots, infiltrated by British intelligence
Convenient that the warnings were ignored and police actually sent civilians into the path of bombs
It finished that group off and destroyed any support for them - a good thing but the methods used to get there certainly were not
Yes, tinfoil hat conspiracy theory, right
Whatever
Collusion was real, hence 'the Troubles' were known as the Dirty War
>Information has emerged that the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) may have been informed 48 hours prior to the event that the Real IRA was to plant the bomb in the town of Omagh on August 15, 1998 that killed 29 people and injured more than 200
Accusations have also been made that the bombing was the work of a British double agent within the Real IRA
A former British double agent calling himself “Kevin Fulton” has made the allegations
Fulton was an ex-British army soldier, who says he was recruited by the secret service to inform on the activities of the IRA in the 1980s. He claims to have been an informer up until the IRA cease-fire in 1996
Fulton has made the allegation to a number of media sources, including Channel Four news and the Guardian newspaper
Fulton alleges that two days prior to the bombing, he met a senior member of the Real IRA—a breakaway grouping opposed to Republican Sinn Fein signing the (April 10) Good Friday Agreement setting up the power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly—in a pub in Dundalk
He states that the man told him, “There’s something big on”, but didn’t go into any more details
He added that the Real IRA member was “covered in dust and smelling like fertiliser
He had definitely been making a bomb”. Following this conversation, Fulton said that he informed his RUC handler “within hours” and that his handler had subsequently confirmed that this information “was put into the system”.
On August 17, Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman Nuala O’ Loan announced that the new allegations would be investigated
A portion of Fulton’s interview with Channel Four reads as follows:
Q: “You think that some of the people responsible for the Omagh bomb were informing at the time
Fulton: “Yes, no doubt”.
Q: “And they couldn’t be compromised
Fulton: “I don’t think the Omagh bombers meant to kill people
The thing is they did, shit happened
Q: “Were the RUC warned about the bomb
Fulton: “I wouldn’t say they were warned; they would have known that certain things would have happened, yes
Q: And you know that for sure
Fulton: “Yes
Fulton stated to the Guardian that he passed on the name of the Real IRA member he suspected of making a bomb to the RUC and also gave the suspect’s car registration number
The crux of Fulton’s allegations is that the British and Irish security forces allowed the bomb to travel in a stolen car from the nearby town of Dundalk to its final destination in Omagh because if it was prevented it could lead to the compromising and possible exposure of agent(s) within the Real IRA
Another ex-informer, Willy Carlin, said of the Fulton allegations, “I would believe that the officer put it in the system, and it would have immediately been shared by the security services, by MI5 and MI6
It would definitely been shared with the Chief Constable, no doubt about it
And it would have been shared with the Garda [the police in the Irish Republic]
And the question is, if it was shared, what happened
And why didn’t someone turn up in Dundalk and watch this man for 48 hours
RUC Chief Constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan described Fulton’s allegations that it had any prior warning about the Omagh as “preposterous”. The RUC claims to know who is personally responsible for the Omagh bombing, but has said no action can be taken because of a lack of evidence and the witnesses needed to secure a conviction
The Fulton allegations come at a time when there is growing frustration about the lack of progress in apprehending and convicting the Omagh bombers
On August 16, the husband of one of the victims of the bombing interrupted a RUC/Garda press conference appealing for more information and said that a “conspiracy” was underway to prevent the conviction of the bombers
Lawrence Rush said to the meeting, “My dear sir, this is a conspiracy
This will come out like the Derry Thirteen [a reference to the Bloody Sunday massacre by the British army in 1972]
This is a conspiracy by the British government and by everyone involved in the administration
This is an example of administrative terrorism
“Why did Sinn Fein close their office the day before the bomb
Why was the army confined to barracks
Why sir, did the RUC have only three men on the streets of Omagh and 24 men in surrounding areas
Tell me that
Fulton states that he also given the Police Ombudsman a copy of a taped conversation between himself and his RUC handler earlier this year
On the tape Fulton is heard to ask if he can recall the 48-hour warning he gave to him before the Omagh bombing
The man Fulton claims to be his handler is heard to reply, “I vaguely remember, but I’d have to check my notes ... I remember something ... I do remember bits and pieces
Fulton’s solicitor, Imran Khan, has said of the allegations, “He is saying that he gave a warning to the RUC prior to the Omagh bomb
He is not saying that he knew the Omagh bomb was going to go off, but that information wasn’t passed on, which could have given the RUC a head start
Fulton’s allegations are backed up by the remarks of another former British double agent, who uses the name Michael Clark
Clark stated on August 18, “It makes perfect sense for the army or the intelligence services to allow the progress and delivery of a device of some nature to preserve and protect the safety of an agent
I believe that is possibly the case”.
Other reports have emerged that the same man responsible for the Omagh bombing may have also been involved in the making and planting of two other bombs detonated around the same time
On August 1, 1998 a bomb went off in Bambridge, County Down injuring 35 people
The bomb was estimated to be of a similar size to that of the Omagh bomb and the individual who reported the bomb to the security services used the same code word
Clark states that he personally informed the British Ministry of Defence that there was a danger that the identity of the bomb maker could be exposed
He said, “We were worried that if there was a possibility that he is an agent, his life has been placed at risk
I took appropriate action and informed the MoD of the relevant details and passed on the information to the senior officer in army intelligence”.
It is not beyond question that a British agent within the Real IRA could have planted the Omagh bomb
Earlier this year more details emerged about the covert activities of the Force Research Unit (FRU), an undercover security operation financed and run by the British state in Northern Ireland for more than two decades
The FRU was a terror network—involving up to 100 soldiers and double agents—that organised a series of covert intelligence and military operations and authorised their agents to carry out numerous illegal activities including bomb making, murder, and the shooting of RUC officers
The FRU’s chain of command reached into the upper echelons of the British state
Fulton himself claims that he became an IRA member on FRU instructions, and took part in a series of terrorist bombings in the 1980s and the early 1990s. These included the 1993 bombing that decimated the town centre in Portadown
Britain was certainly a political beneficiary of the Omagh bombing
It led to a widespread public outcry demanding an end to more than 30 years of violence and helped isolate the dissident paramilitary groups, both republican and loyalist, opposed to the signing of the Northern Ireland Agreement
The bombing provided a pretext for the Blair government to introduce new laws before a specially recalled Parliament
These laws, which the Prime Minister himself described as being of a “draconian and fundamental nature”, allow the conviction of someone belonging to a proscribed organisation on the evidence of a senior police officer alone
A defendant’s right to silence was breached, by provisions whereby the refusal to answer a “relevant question” or to cooperate with any “relevant inquiry” at any time will be regarded as corroboration of the police officer’s evidence
The measures also include unprecedented powers to convict people on the basis of conspiring within Britain to commit terrorist offences anywhere in the world, making it possible to criminalise and even ban a swathe of organisations opposed to regimes friendly towards Britain

What's the flag at the top of Ireland
The north of Ireland does not have its own flag
It appears to be an Ulster banner flag which is a bastardised version of the real [flag of Ulster] - the yellow was replaced with white and a crown was added
That was used for 'protestant state for a protestant people' and was abolished in 1973
It has no official status and is only used by loyalists and unionists
>The Ulster Banner was used by the Northern Ireland government from 1953 until the government and parliament were abolished in 1973
Since then, it has had no official status

Fulton himself claims that he became an IRA member on FRU instructions, and took part in a series of terrorist bombings in the 1980s and the early 1990s. These included the 1993 bombing that decimated the town centre in Portadown
Britain was certainly a political beneficiary of the Omagh bombing
It led to a widespread public outcry demanding an end to more than 30 years of violence and helped isolate the dissident paramilitary groups, both republican and loyalist, opposed to the signing of the Northern Ireland Agreement
The bombing provided a pretext for the Blair government to introduce new laws before a specially recalled Parliament
These laws, which the Prime Minister himself described as being of a “draconian and fundamental nature”, allow the conviction of someone belonging to a proscribed organisation on the evidence of a senior police officer alone
A defendant’s right to silence was breached, by provisions whereby the refusal to answer a “relevant question” or to cooperate with any “relevant inquiry” at any time will be regarded as corroboration of the police officer’s evidence
The measures also include unprecedented powers to convict people on the basis of conspiring within Britain to commit terrorist offences anywhere in the world, making it possible to criminalise and even ban a swathe of organisations opposed to regimes friendly towards Britain

What's the flag at the top of Ireland
The north of Ireland does not have its own flag
It appears to be an Ulster banner flag which is a bastardised version of the real [flag of Ulster] - the yellow was replaced with white and a crown was added
That was used for 'protestant state for a protestant people' and was abolished in 1973
It has no official status and is only used by loyalists and unionists
>The Ulster Banner was used by the Northern Ireland government from 1953 until the government and parliament were abolished in 1973
Since then, it has had no official status
