This thread is super interesting to me because I know a couple of girls around my age (25 yo) with croatian ancestry who are named Katica and Slavica
I didn’t know they were “ancient-sounding” and in fact they sound kinda nice in spanish
There are exceptions too, my ex-gf’s name is Janja, which I think sounds horrible lmao
172m? Woow . Here the highest elevation is 6908 m.
Honestly, almost all of the Spanish in Breaking Bad is pretty bad
Some phrases sound like they made a really good dialogue in English and then they translate it with google translate
Also the strange accent makes it more noticeable
As for the Gus Fring accent, I understand that the actor cannot imitate the Chilean accent, after all it is one of the most difficult accents in Spanish
What I don't understand is his dialogue, he doesn't use Chilean slang at all
The Chilean slang is too noticeable to the point that just changing one word of his dialogue would have been enough to make the character seem Chilean
As a Latinamerican, I've always found this so odd
I think much of this attitude comes from the fact that, as a country, the US has been deeply segregated, both racially and ethnically since its inception, this preventing a much greater national identity from occurring
Don't quote me on this, but unlike my country or other Latam countries, I feel like white people in the US are more prone to feel close to the people of the country they have distant relatives rather than the racial and ethnic minorities from the US
This, of course, is my opinion based on the different experience I have as coming from a Latin country
It's just based on comparing the situations
In Chile that is called a “Berlín”, although it has pastry cream instead
They are very common
En español también
In spanish we have the letter “h”, which doesn’t make sound unless it’s next to a “c”.
For example, “zanahoria” (carrot), the h has no sound, but in “chile” the h has sound
Here in Chile we have the word “wea”, which is used in every way possible
You can use it as a noun, verb, adjective, very much like kurwa
Phonemic languages are the best
They’re much easier to understand
"Chilean accent" probably :c
But I have to say that, at least in South America, we frequently mock the castilian accent, the typical "spanish accent" because the youtubers from Spain are very popular here
Oh sorry I meant to say that in "general" our accent is commonly mocked
Specially in Latin America
Here in Chile we use “Born with a silver spoon” or “Born in a golden crib”.
Denmark, i love the people, the culture , the cities, the language, everything
Even tho it's a very flat country i find some kind of charming about it
Not spanish, but I've heard an spanish version that sounds "natural"
"Cabeza, rodillas, muslos y caderas" x2
I heard it in a song from "Residente"
Cool, here in Chile, we normally say “Aló”, I particularly tend to say “Aló, si
”. Sometimes “Hola” will suffice
When a friend or family member calls me, I say “Dime” or “Dígame”
I'm impressed Spanish is so popular
Bueno, yo siempre pensé que el italiano y el francés sonaban bonito
Well, I always thought that Italian and French sounded good
I disagree, I am learning German and it sounds a bit like English but with rrr and ä
Totally agree, Finnish also looks well when written down
I think it depends on what Spanish
Spaniards speak good Spanish, but it sounds weird, to me the best Spanish speakers are Colombians and Venezuelans
Italian is like ravioli (idk it has a lot of"i")
South American here, you can hear very often parents calling their childs papito/mami
TIL, Scotland knows best
> Brexit had approximately 75% turnout
Oof
that's bad
In that case, it was a clear win then
Iran, Turkey when China commits literal genocide of the uighurs: *I sleep*
Iran, Turkey when France gets though on political Islam: **REAL SHIT**
That's equality
Yet the US system has lasted longer than most european ones
Can I be a communist and an anti-stalinist
The USSR was a degenerated state, in no way represents my belief on communism or socialism, and Stalin was a genocidal maniac on the same level as Hitler in my book
But that has fuck all to do with communism
Damn
Being from Chile, I’m used to 5-6 richter earthquakes, but after seeing pictures, you can tell that many buildings over there are very old and not prepared for this
Stay strong
Also, expect aftershocks, which will be (normally) shorter and less destructive, even a few days afterwards, so don’t be scared if it happens, just try to stay away from windows
I wonder what the URSS did in Europe between 1945 and 1994 that made people change of opinion
Imagine a Darth Vader themed train coming, and a group of jedis waiting in the platform
Russia delenda est
I mean, most changes that people announce as world ending end up being mild annoyances
Most of the users in this site are teens
That's why
Here in Chile we also had protests against our shit government, but are on hold due to Covid
Sadly, I saw how quickly reddit and the world forgot about it in a few days
People in first world countries like the US rapidly forget about struggles in "less important" countries, like yours or ours
So, from a forgotten country, I hope your protests work out and be succesful
That city looks lifeless
It's very telling how irrational some of the anti-US hate is that we have german users blaming America for Crimea and Ukraine
honestly, would be funny if france was the only country that doesnt change, meaning that france itself is an insult
ITT: no one reads the damn article
The EU, America and Japan should join against the risk Chinese hegemony
Are your trains small af or you guys are giants in the UK
41 grados la puta madre, me muero con ese calor

Yeah, it looks better than before, but they went overboard
That cornice looks gigantic
Huh, then it probably was *an even older, 4 levels building before*, which was then expanded with two additional floors (leaving the oversized cornice in an odd position), balconies, a haussman roof and baroque style ornaments at some point, damaged and then now restored to its pre-war 6 floor state
Those are in proportion though, and the larger one is the roof cornice; the one in this renovation was increased in size from the original one and now blocks the windows from the street view
