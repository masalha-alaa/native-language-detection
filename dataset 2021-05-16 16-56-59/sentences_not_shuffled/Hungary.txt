Imho the darkest fact is that our nation basically worships St
Stephen (aka
Stephen the 1st) who made the country recognized by forcing religious conversions
Which is why little to nothing of pre-christian hungarian culture remains
No diety names, no customs, no stories, no legends, a few fragments of runic script survived and thats it
Among other things its very unlikely tha Gerard Sagredo, aka Szent Gellért was murdered by a pagan mob without a cause
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
I would also add the 1985 Austrian MASS wine poisoning scandal, which is obscure
(Hopefully i get away with it thanks, common rulers)
Slavery is also common in Hungary, especially in rural areas
There are field and house slaves and everything
The area around the town of Szarvas is the worst, where many large farmsteads keep some slaves to do unpaid labor
The practice is known as "csicskáztatás", and the slave is known as a "csicska" (distinct from the Hungarian word for slave, "rabszolga")
[There's even a film about it
But it was a catholic one thus its fine
Not the only "dictatorship"
Hungaty is a democtratic dictatorship, the government somehow always get just 66% of the votes which is enough to basically change any law, only some exceltions like establishing a kingdom etc
They rigged the voting in favor of them
They sent out a questionnaire whit basically things like:
"The eu is forcing us to let immigrants in, etc" (so they lie) and then ask a question like:do you think we should protect the country more from corona
" Yes/no
Like the actual heck
But last year they fucked up big time, and lost nearly all the major cities
(So now they won like 90%of the mayor elections, but only 50% of the population with like 40% of the gdp)
So what did our "great and best" goverment do
Took away all the rights from the cities, but still blame them for everything
Then they established  "democtratic dictatorship" because of corona, not for a set amount of time, but for as long as they want it
Nah the idea is VERY old
Its even present in Plato's classics
Ofc, its not, however christianity gets a free pass at pretty much anything
Did you know that the pope excommunicated all members of the jury who sentenced the croatian arcbishop for war crimes
Well CIA supported every damned military coup that put more religion into the leadership of its "allies". Regardless what religion, or the atrocities commited, after all comunism had tobe beaten at ANY price
At least you didn have stuff like the nazi pedophile colony imported into south america to hava torturers
There is a slight difference between sweden and Germany
Among other things the swedish population was far less ardent and helpful in the execution of the genocide compared to the German one
And passivity causes far less suffering than waging a land war till you hit an ocean
&#x200B;
(Maybe it was because the Reich's population was subject to the propaganda longer, maybe for some other reason
At the end of the day its simply dishonest to equate all european states who didn't wage war against it, to the Reich)
>Under Stepinac's leadership, the bishops' conference released a letter condemning alleged Partisan war crimes in September 1945
The following year Stepinac was arrested and put on trial, which was perceived by some as a show trial
In October 1946, in its first special session for 75 years, the Vatican excommunicated Tito and the Yugoslav government for sentencing Stepinac to 16 years in prison on charges of assisting Ustaše terror and of supporting forced conversions of Serbs to Catholicism
Naturally the church had nothing to do with operating ratlines and giving asylum to ustase war criminals in vatican city
Nor was "brother satan", or that other franciscan monk who won the contest of most prisoners executed by knife (with 1360 victims) in any way shape or form related to the croatian catholic church let alone the vatican
&#x200B;
Sarcasm aside, this all falls perfectly in line with the modus operandi of abrahamic religions
Commit abhorrent crimes, then use the resulting outrage to claim religion is unjustly persecuted
Its going back to early years, like St
Boniface destroyinv the religious site of sacrdd groves of jupiter, the alexandria riots
And ofc
the U.S. Catholic Church Spent $281,611,817 on Child Sex Abuse Cases in 2019
Hungary
I don't hate my country butit started going down on a wrong path and I don't see a good future for it
Croatia
Hungary wants to have a shore again
The Netherlands
It will slowly get replaced with water anyway, it'd just end the whole thing quickly
Slovakia or Croatia
Look we just need sea alright
Either us or Romania but one of us have to go
Romania
Haven't you heard of The Hungarian Sea
(Balaton)
Hello seaside
It's for the better
I would say the same, if we can emigrate to Slovakia
Szlovákia nem is létezik
Grab a map, stupid
No, it's a fresh water lake
But the largest in Central Europe
We seem to be sinking with you, so it's ok :D
it's a meme, boi i neither have a problem with you
Ahem
_WE_ (like along with you guys too) fucked up the war, not just we as Hungarians
We didn't want to start the war either, the prime minister István Tisza tried to persuade Franz Joseph not to attack Serbia
I expect nothing more than an English Trump
To OP:  "but Danish historians today agree that the agreement was most fair and that Hækkerup was not drunk"
Sauce: wiki
Mohács
1956 revolution when the Soviet tanks arrived
The past 500 years
In 1505 our nobility agreed that we shall never have foreign kings ever again
20 years later we have our asses handed to us by the ottomans at the battle of Mohács and the Habsburgs quickly rush in to claim our throne
Meanwhile Transylvania broke off under John Zápolya and made an agreement with the Ottomans to become their vassal
We ended up with having our lands constantly ravaged for 150 years (yes even during peacetime as the rule of law didn't exist here for that time, and you could argue it doesn't ever since) and we spent half of our history under foreign rule because we fucked up that one time which ruined Hungary to the point that we're still trying to recover
Vlad was very hostile to the Transylvanian Saxons and their trade practices, which hurt Hungarian interests
It's no wonder he was thrown in cell after he lost his country, and the new Wallachian ruler, Radu III promised to restore the Saxon trading rights
Tfw you purposefully don't arrive to the battle with your army so that the Ottomans would kill the king and your noble friends elect you to be the new one
But then the Ottomans obliterate 1/3 of the country, Habsburgs yoink another 1/3 (and the crown) through some obscure rite of succession, and now you're on your own at war with the Ottoman AND the Habsburg empire
John Zápolya, master strategist ladies and gentlemen
Holy shit, who's the guy
I need to read more about this madlad
Who
The only pretender at the time was Radu and he was at the Turks, not the Saxons
A group with which the Saxons did have connection and common interests were the Boyars, who Vlad himself alienated with his policies, akin to the Saxons
Edit: I forgot about Basarab the Old as pretender, but he wasn't backed by the Saxons either
Edit2: I forgot Dan too
Damn, I need to reread my books
I'll correct myself in future comments
The Saxons of Brassó/Braşov expelled Dan in 1457 and dropped their support for them
It was Vlad III, who reignited the conflict, when he massacred settled Saxons from Brassó/Braşov within Wallachia in 1459
That's when the Saxons began to support Dan again, in retaliation
Basarab Laiotă only came into the picture first in early 1460, but yeah I was wrong about the Saxons not supporting him
I misremembered, since it wasn't the Saxons but the Turks, who ultimately got him on the throne afterall
In summary the exact conflict, which eventually led to Vlad III's imprisonment was initiated by Vlad III himself
> Yes but you cant claim he didnt have a casus beli
The Saxons didn't support any of the pretenders, when Vlad III started the conflict
They did on an earlier occassion, but not at the time
The bad blood was indeed already there though
> anyway isnt know for sure that the reason he was imprisonned was that one
That's true, that we can't know for sure, but it's speculated to be an important notion behind his imprisonment
Crime, mugging, herbal and 'szoszi van egy szal cigid'. The last one means 'hey, do you have a cigarette'
I was working as a delivery man in the UK and the types of people I've met has really opened my eye for a 20 year old at that time
>not being able to afford quality health care
Do you mean insurance, or do Finns use private healthcare a lot
Which country
Flair up
Nah, you just didn't say where you were from, so your comment was not understandable
Yes, when I was spending a lot of time with my English friends, in addition to watching and reading almost everything in English, I certainly felt I was getting worse at Hungarian
Lately though I speak a lot less English (still read and watch a lot of stuff in English though), and I find myself forgetting Hungarian words less and less
On the other hand, I'm not quite as confident at speaking in English as I was back then
Yes, sometimes i forget the words in my language and only know those words in english
I work with English and as a result I started to use English words even while talking in Hungarian
I cannot even talk about my work in my native language, due to the lingo used there
For me sometimes it happens yeah
Like I want to say a word but I forget the Hungarian version and the English form comes sooner into my mind
But I often just mix the two languages and use a half English half Hungarian sentence
We even have a word for it, it's called "Hunglish".
I don't mind it, it know it's not perfect
According to a Canadian and a Texan guy it's sometimes hard to understand because of the thick accent, but multiple French coworkers said that for them it's much easier than even other French people's accent
I don't, I always feel like I am reading english words out loud in my own language
Others can understand me but I feel like I'm not even speaking english
I dont like mine, i try to sound more British, but I cannot
Hungarians don't really have accents most people here just have shitty pronounciation
It is english but if a 3 year old spoke it
Yes, You could say that is an accent but it is not strong like russian or german (which actually sound good)
Also most of us don't use a translator and even if we do it's from like the 1800s.
People say  I speak english fluenty (not tryna flex here)
So no
We don't have accents
We just need to practice
I have a british accent, because I lived in England for a bit
So yes i absolutely love it
(am hungarian)
Edit: North-Yorkshire accent
I have an accent when speaking English (although probably not as bad as most other Hungarians), and a really obvious accent when speaking German (or French, but I use that really infrequently)
I don't really like or dislike it, but I consider my accent part of my identity
In Hungary’s case it definitely is the price of iPhones
Hungary has one of the biggest taxes on products in Europe and the world, 27%. If you think about it: a new iPhone is $1000
Now add $270 and then some extra profit, let’s say another $100
That’s around $1370 which many people can’t afford here
It may be even more if you buy it with a plan
Another thing is jealousy
There are people who love Androids for their own reason and there is no problem with that, but a lot of people hate iPhones because it’s “trendy” to hate them
Mostly because of their price
Ultimately the price is the key in Hungary’s case
I’m not sure about France or Germany
People here (atleast in my country) don't really like to spend more than 250 300 usd for a phone
Most will get one for 150 and that is it
Especially in eastern europe
Androids are also tougher and since many MANY people still work things that aren't in offices they won't break their phone
Also iphone customers here are mostly girls/women since iphones look girlier (most of them are white
)We don't buy the newest phone as soon as it comes out
Price / value is the problem - even if you can buy it why would you
Not to mention the questionable design philosophy of "it just works" by apple, which is used to justify removing features as "the main feature of our brand".
No headphone jack, because
We can use stronger material for the screen
lets make it thinner, instead more durable
Plus the image of walled garden is also stuck with the brand
Often leading to perceptionthat people with more money than sense are the main customers
One thing is to look at the design
Sure it has some problems
I personally like it, it’s my taste
I use an iPhone instead of a phone running on Android because of the system
I love iOS, it’s simple and I never had any problems with it
I’ve used Android before, it’s been unreliable for me
It was years ago so things probably changed but I don’t plan on switching back
So it’s worth it for me
Of course others will think otherwise it’s just my preference
Hungary is mostly Messenger as well, all of my friends use it, even for group chats
Viber used to be relatively popular here before they were bought by Rakuten
You have access to things like linux terminal
Sure apple is "clean", however lacking features is still not a feature imho
>many android manufacturers are following apple in doing so too
Many androide manufacturers follow apple no matter what
As this point - in product design - apple achieved a cult status, to the point where its actions are not to be questioned
&#x200B;
>Removing the headphone jack also frees up space that can be used for other hardware
And removing the jack doesn't mean that you can't use wired headphones, you just need to have an adapter (which comes in the box)
Yes, you can use headphones
Likely even with zero physical ports you can later on buy apple bloototh dongle that connets to phone/mac to offer ports
Still there currently its nothing short of making life harder for customers, who want to keep using their hardware
Sure you can use your headphone jack
Sure you can use USB
Its just not convenient
Yes, that is not AS bad as stopping you from using it completely
However its also not something i am willing to see as a "feature" something that makes me go "shut up and take my money", something that i am willing to fork more money over
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
I would happily pay extra for stuff like:
* its going to keep working if i abuse it, drop it, mishandle it
* standard wire connections to as much stuff as possible, for convenience, hell maybe even a cable routed around a phone's edge that folds out and can be plugged directly into mains
* large battery capacity - so phone works for a day, even when screen is on full brightness - yes, we have more efficient SOC, so the software in background puff on on very little power, however, not having to worry about phone dieing on you if you go fishing and browse ...etc
would be VERY welcome
* Using oled technology to package a large screen into a manageable form factor
* (useable) stylus integration
* camera that can be removed from the device, to take pictures from places where phone doesnt fit, and to allow using phone as a remote for the camera
* 360° camera when you have enough ensors on the damn thing for it
&#x200B;
Taking away features, because it was what Steve Jobs said people wanted is not something i am willing to pay extra for
[Természetesen Miskolc]
Debrecen
Just an overgrown village filled with fascist peasants
Érd is 20km from the capital and it still has mostly dirt roads
It has city status with a population over 65k and nicknamed "the biggest village".
I just recently found out about the "dupa o saptamana in Vaslui" meme
It's my new favorite
Let's add Neckarsulm to that
TIL Malmö is a city, not only a brand of furniture
That city is the hungarian state of Alabama
I thought Miskolc
It has the worst reputation
Miskolc basically is a good place
It´s basicly one city
Do you have a source for this
I'm just curious because everyone is saying Moldova, but you're saying it's actually Serbia who is the poorest
I always say my bus got into a traffic jam
Others never say excuses because they appear to be in time always
We say the same in Hungary
Luxembourg brothers comfirmed
It's similar to the saying when you want your guests leave
"I have a medicine I have to take 30 minutes before going to sleep
I've already taken 20 minutes ago
Or the following works with two people (a couple), one to the other:
"Let's sleep, since they wish to leave
I worked as a tram driver as a part time job when I was attending the university
On my very first day (without supervision from an experienced tram driver), I accidentally changed the switch into the wrong direction, so I had to get off, and manually switch back with the so called "switch iron" which is a heavy rod
Not in Germany, because you guys have more modern stuff
For example, earlier there was the IBIS system, and I presume, nowadays there are other, even more sophisticated systems; but the thing is that the tram somehow "knows" on which route it's going (through GPS or other stuff), so it automatically changes the switches if necessary with radio control or other stuff
But Budapest (and other places in Eastern Europe) still has a system where there is a short, special section of the catenary like 30-50 meters before the switch
If the switch leads to the right direction, the driver has to roll under this short section without accelerating or taking any other current (the auxiliary systems are often also shut down during this if they consume too much), and the switch stays in the original direction, and it becomes locked, so a next tram wouldn't change it while the tram is still on it (thus the following tram must wait before going under this section of catenary until the previous has left the switch)
If it must change the switch, the tram must accelerate, and thus pick up current from the catenary
The system senses this, and changes the direction of the switch (and locks it, of course)
Sometimes you can fail, either you don't (or can't) change when you need to, or change the switch unnecessarily (like I did on my first day)
Hungary would be the guy who pretends he's doing the job really well, but actually does close to nothing, and everyone knows it
He takes 7 smoke breaks a day
If you try to accuse him of not doing his work he gets angry and goes on a rant about conspiracy theories on immigration
That one guy who's always asking for raise, and continue to talk shit about the boss after getting a raise
We're that one guy that keeps complaining someone else keeps eating their lunch while having their mouth full with someone else's lunch
Just about right
I'm still not sure if I should write colour or color
I had the same teacher teaching both
Our textbooks usually explained both versions and the exams didn’t really need you to get it right in just only one way
One could easily write: colourless organizers
I always hated it though
Everything is sugary and sweet
I swear even bread was sugary instead of salty
When someone compliments my outfit here, I start searching for a cig because they are gonna ask for one
Imho teaching quadratic formula as "university level" stuff is inexcuseable
Its zero thinking involved recipe, you go through the motions and get the result
Even calculus with algebraic functions and complex numbers are within easy reach of most highscooler
Those are not hard - if a well trained monkey can learn it, so can you
>I haven’t visited any national parks, but from what I know the US does that stuff much better than European countries typically do
In terms of size, i agree, but there is no shortage of absolutely stunning ones in the EU
Plitvicze lakes in croatia,  Białowieża forest in Poland are something really unique
Nah, that exists in Europe, sadly I know
In Hungary, younger children use Uncle/Aunt Firstname for addressing teachers, while older children use Mr/Mrs Teacher
Also religious crazies don't get a free pass at whatever stupid they do in the rest of the world, because offending their feeling = communism
Christians bombing abortion clinics is a uniquely US pehnomenon
I am still unwilling to let the "quadratic formula is not for everyone" slide
Thats criminal
I meant that the rest of the world doesn't have christian fundamentalists bombing abortion clinics
Parents sending their kids to south america, so that ex-cartel personel can torture the gay out of them
That only happens in the "One nation under gaaaawd".
Sure westboro baptists church can be disturbing, however thats the least of the sketchy shit religious groups get away with
&#x200B;
(Not to mention the utterly insane "church culture" - for lack of a better term - as its often the only places for socializing in large swaths of land
Which leads to atheist being as trusted as muslims on the day after 9/11
And that was the highes trust polled for atheiest in the US)
The first amandment in the states is a joke
Its not something that can be taken seriously since the cold war
What it looks like it was intended to be is laicite
What you got is basically an excuse for christian churches, to have freedom of religion, not freedom from religion
Aka
you can pick a version of christianity that you like
However if you are not christian good luck getting your right, as it makes you de facto (even if not de jure) unable to hold office, "qualify" for aid - as most such things are operated to spread faith, not to aid poor ...etc
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
From the other side of the big pond it looks insane, when poor kids as soop kitchen operated by church tell that they pray, because thats how they get food
I find the fact that this can happen as morally repugnant as grainting sainthood to motehr theresa, or harboring war criminals the Waffen SS kicked out for excessive zeal by the vatican
Hungarian President Viktor Orbán got basically unlimited powers for as long as hed like to have them
So far they've tried to abolish transgender rights, and the right to change your biological sex
Can the women travel abroad to get an abortion ?
If Hungary whent to war whith one of its neighbours, it wouldnt be croatia
Attila, Álmos, Árpád for males
Emese, Réka for females
These are from the times just before founding the Kingdom of Hungary (9th, 10th century)
Actually, they don't sound very archaic, because they are quite popular and widespread today as well, and Attila is world-famous because of the Hunnic ruler
EDIT: you could list several other examples, but I think there are two groups: there are old-Hungarian names generally used and not unusual; and there are some old-Hungarian names used by neo-pagans or chauvinists etc which are rather unusual
Funny enough, Eszter is the 8-14 most popular name for females in Hungary
Yeah, you can expand the list, I just wrote the most prominent examples
Bendegúz is also included in the National Anthem
Na jó, de ezeket is be lehet osztani normálisra meg turbómagyarra (mármint a mai használat szerint):
Normál: Álmos, Előd, Huba
Turbó: Ond, Kond, Tas, Töhötöm
szerintem
I swear these sound like names ripped from a World of Warcraft expansion
I know some Álmoses, that's why I included it
Not sure, I dont really see any Árpád's nowadays
Your name means "warlord" in Hungarian
I used to have two colleagues (from a group of 30) called Árpád (one of them quit), and have at least 5 other acquaintances called so
Szerintem a Töhötöm legalább a _Hannibál tanár úr_ óta diszkvalifikálta magát ebből a mezőnyből. :)
A Tason ingadoztam én is
Ignác is an old hungarian name as well
What does Germany think
I would bet that greens there see runaway greenhouse effet as favourable to nuclear power
After all one of them causes massive enviromenal issues, which means more issues the greens can solve
More popularity, more votes, more newspapres and online articles read
Its not a win-win situation, but its t least a win for greens
No, I just simply forget basic Hungarian words when I try to speak
I have learned english since i was 5 so i grew up with it
I watch so many stuff in english because there are not many videos that interest me in hungarian (my native language)
And yea, it often happens that i don't understand my native language for a few seconds
The Parliament
It's the most beautiful circus in the entire world
But seriously, a gorgeous building
Many inventions and discoveries have the hands of hungarian scientists in them, for example the computer, atomic bombs, and vitamin C.
We have a tradition of not clinking with beer
In 1849, the austrian officials clinked their cups of beer after every execution of the 13 hungarian generals of the fight for independence
This tradition would've lasted 150 years, which we're over, but you know, stayed a tradition, just like our borders from Trianon
You can clink it if you say "Vesszen Haynau
" (may Haynau perish), though, because Haynau was the croatian leader who ordered the execution of the generals and ordered the physical retaliations after
Our church bells ring every day at 12 o'clock
This tradition stems from the siege of Nándorfehérvár, in 1456
In support for the fight against the osmans, the popes ordered church bells to be ringed every noon while the fight lasted, and later kept ringing to protect the christian culture from islam invasion
We have a lot of thermal water underground across the entire country
And we build thermal spas over it whenever we find a new source
Hungary is the second oldest country in Europe, founded in 896
Hungary was the second country in the world to have a metro line
Hungary has an incredibly high number of hot springs, and under the capital is the largest geothermal cave system, made up of over 200 subterranean chambers
The largest synagogue in Europe is found in Budapest, the synagogue is also the third largest in the world
The hungarian alphabet (latin alphabet) has 44 letters, and has letters that consist of more than one characters
Bonus: The first reliable ball point pen was invented by László Bíró and Imre Gellért, patented in 1938
Hungary has the oldest metro in continental Europe and the second oldest in the world
The second largest synagogue in the world and the largest in Europe is the Dohány Street Synagogue in Budapest
Gyermekvasút (Children's railway) is a railway run by 4th, 5th and 6th grade children
All of the posts operated by children except the train driver

We use eastern name order so we put our family name first (but we don't change the foreign name's order when we write or speak except for some historical names like John Calvin -> Kálvin János, Martin Luther -> Luther Márton)
You can't buy tobacco products in regular shops since 2013
There's special shops for them, called Nemzeti dohánybolt (National tobacco shop) and you can't even go to these shops if you are under 18

The Oxford University is also older than the Aztec Empire
áéíóöőúüű cs dz dzs gy ly ny sz ty zs
These are all 1 letters
I would however advise to be cautious with the "hungarians invented everything" theories, as there is PLENTY of bogus floating around
...like hungarians inventing the helicopter, matchstick
etc
Budapest is literally the capital of thermal baths, it has the highest number of hot springs for a capital (123) and the highest number of thermal baths
Also our language is an island amongst other language families (Hungarian is Urallic - thus many language 'relatives' live in Russia, we are sandwiched between a Latin, a German and many Slavs)
Thus learning the language is quite difficult, but not THE hardest
Funnily enough our passport grants access to 163 countries, quite interesting when you compare the percentage of Hungarians that have been out of the Carpathian Basin
I wouldn't go as far as to call Tesla a scientist
He was  great man, nd many things, but scientist wasn't one of them
His work doesn't show even a slight resemblance of the scientific method
Why didn't we think of that
That's why I went with that wording, but the chances of a hungarian being involved in something abroad is pretty high when a couple
hundred
thousand goes out of the country because it's better than getting used to the incompetent leadership
Good question
What i meant is that the number of hungarian inventions are drastically inflated in opular culture, we both know that (or t least i hope)
&#x200B;
A good example would be Oszkar Asboth, who "invented the helcopter", in reality he made one more prototype that was completely uncontrollable without being tethered to the ground, to boost the long line of non-airworthy rotary wing aircraft like things
Similarly while János Iriny made significant contrbutions to matchstick, he didn't invent them, that was done in the 6th century, nor did he create the currently used variants
And despite popular misconceptions, Albert Szentgyörgyi didn't discover vitamin-c nor did he get a nobel prize for said discovery
He got his noble prize or his research on the biological effects of vitamin-c. Of course that is not good enough for hungarin exceptionalism
Similarly, while hungarian scientists worked on computers they did it faaar to late, to have any claims to inventing them
At best we could say that they formalized what constitues as a computer
Not to mention that the manhattan project was not even remotely close to exculsively manned by hungarians
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Thats without getting started on the crackpot theories that didn't even contain a grain of truth among the distortion, that tend to go alongside these
Anything from "Jesus was hungarian", "ancient sumerians were hungarians, because SOME of their city names are hungarian words" to "the dalai lama came to Hungary to visit the earth's heart chakra at the peak called Dobogókő" (\~Beatingheart, being a passable translation)
Death ray
Earthquake machines
Wild claims about transmitting electricity in all 3 dimensions from a tower, without the electromagnetic radiation getting spread thin and weak over the large volume
Tesla turbines being the best thing since butter
etc
As you said he was a "wonder-man", there were plenty of times where he stumbled on something golden
However he completely lacked scientific rigor, and made wildly unsubstantiated claims that fall more in line with the "snake oil sales man", than with "scientist".
We would say no, because we feel we can do anything (because we feel like some sort of survivals - our history is not pretty after 1526), but in the meantime we agree that our politics is a shitshow
Oh man bunch of things, here are a few in no particular order:
• George Soros is an evil mastermind behind everything that is “bad” in the world;
• EU = bad;
• Everyone = also bad (except for dictatorships, those guys are cool);
• Fidesz (the ruling party) is a benevolent entity bringing the people closer to God;
• Hungary is doing better than ever and a model country for the rest of the continent;
• Muslims are replacing the population of Europe;
• Refugees are constantly sieging our southern borders hence we need to be in a “state of war”;
• Socialism was the best thing ever and we should go back to the good ol’ times
Anything progressive is a conspiracy by Soros, illegal arab immigrants are flooding Europe, Brussels is restricting our countryrights, if we go with Europe Hungary will die, Russia is a lovely Country who wants to help Hungary preserve its sovereignity
Basically that everyone is against Hungary except China, Russia and the V4
Plus, that Hungary is doing great
That it will catch up with Austria in like 4 years
Basically, a bunch of bullshit
And they do it so people that can only look at the TV will be scared enough so Fidesz can get 2/3 of votes in all elections wich gives them free reign in the country
And they arent idiots
They shattered the opposition without banning them
Basically if all of the opposition got into one big coalition, even then they couldnt beat them
They believe in the current government
Orbán is stopping him for 4 years, the best enemy to fight is the one you make up
Wtf, they are saying that there too
I thought that only Hungary has to deal with this shit
Tito's still alive
SAS is the best airline, because it means "Eagle" in Hungarian
So everybody pronounces it as "shash" and not "es-a-es".
Obviously not everyone is like that, but I agree, it's bad
Due to the constant brainwashing of the government the general populace is downright hostile to foreigners
Thankfully the large majority understands (despite the neverending anti-EU propaganda the government is pushing) that it's beneficial to be in the EU
That's Orban's only message they haven't been able to push successfully
Not for their lack of trying though
And that we need to extend the fence to Croatia and Romania for safety
Thanks for clearing that up
Last time i watched Hungarian TV they still promoted Russia as a friend of Hungary when we made that agreement on that nuclear plant
I tought its only a hungarian problem
How do you feel an Orbán swap
For us it's not surprising due to his Hungarian origins, and I was kind of aware of the conspiracies around him but not on this scale
In Hungary, I'm talking about billboards, tv ads, and a constant barrage of newspaper articles talking about him
The government is not doing it anymore, (well the billboards at least) but just a few years ago, you couldn't take a step without Soros' face staring at you from somewhere
I don't know since we say "shash", but I thought you should say that since it's an abbreviation
Ask our shitty prime minister to stop it
Yep :)
Fuck
We had him for 9 years, it started to get boring
Don't you know someone who might fancy an Orban
I heard the Belgians don't have a government, maybe they would take him in
Millionaires associated with the Prime Minister
I don't think he is recycleble material
I don't know man, I was thinking about giving him away to an ex-minister shelter but I would rather give it to somewhere I know he won't make something stupid
China might take it as an act of war, I wouldn't risk it
Így sok nyelvtani különlegesség el fog veszni, de megpróbálom
Like this lot grammatical peculiarity away hold lose, but I try
Úgy tűnik, hogy az értelem is elveszett
Félek, ez nem könnyű.
Such it seems, that the meaning too away lost
I'm afraid this no easy
I think this (is) an interesting idea
Only that have to out find (I), that whatabout write (I should)
Yesterday went (I) gym (to the), then class (to) went (I)
Yeah, just as I thought, it looks terrible
Also it's very difficult to exactly copy the structure of Hungarian sentences to English
"Crackings the knuckleshis"
*megropogtatja az ujjait"
Great-like idea, but the hungarian and the english language very differentthey, therefore this funny excercise too many time consumewould up
On the other hand not knowI, whatabout should speakI
CanI speakto kittymy lifeabout, but not thinkI, that many person interestwould
Today, a very important national holiday is Hungary in
This (is) the anniversary the 1956 Revolution of
This a revolution the soviets against was 1956
October 23 on
This the day on, no one doesn't work and the schools too closed are
know(I) that little late(ly) join(I) the party-to but not even that bad idea that said(you)
Érdekes, hogy Október van, de mégis napos és egészen meleg az idő, körülbelül 15 fok van most kint
Szerintem mindig Októberben a legszebb az ég, legalábbis ha nincsenek felhők, ilyenkor sokkal kékebb, mint máskor
Az is elég furcsa, hogy mindjárt November, mégis tele vannak a fák levelekkel, sokuk még sárgulni sem kezdett
Interesting, that October is, but still sunny and pretty warm the weather, around 15 degrees is now out
In-my-opinion always October-in the most beautiful the sky, at-least if no clouds, at times like this much bluer, than other times
It too is pretty strange, that almost November, still full are the trees leaves-with, many-of-them yet to-get-yellower not started
No even know(I) how should this(for) at it begin
Maybe somehow like this
Ezt jól tetted, de szerintem elég furcsa, hogy a sofőr nem szólt rá erre a maszk nélküli illetőre
jobban kéne vigyáznunk egymásra
&#x200B;
That good did-you, but in-my-opinion pretty strange, that the driver not tell to this the mask without-er person-to
better should protect each-other
Gondoltam, hogy elég vicces, hogy a magyarban a jövőt kifejező segédige az azt jelenti, hogy fogni
:) Mellesleg máshogy is működik mint az angol, amit nehéz sajnos kifejezni az angol nyelv miatt
I thought, that rather funny, that the in Hungarian the future expressing auxilary-verb that that means that to hold
:) Besides elsehow too works like the English, what hard unfortunately express the English language due to
Then in-this similar the countries-ours each-other-to, sadly
The prime minister said:"George Soros will open the borders for immigrants" and after that started to make billboards saying:"George Soros will give citizenship to immigrants
Stop the Soros plan
Orbán Viktor once said: "A kormánynak soha nem az a dolga, hogy kormányozzon"
It means something like: "it's never a job of the government to govern"
Our government went ahead and did it
silly westerners and their imaginary friends lmao
From Lisboa
Yeah, kind of ironic that whose work is essential to maintain society and civilization can't work from home - who can shelter themselves by working from home could do nothing for a week or two and nobody would notice
[Budapest - Belgrade] is being upgraded right now for billions of Euros, the travelling time will decrease from 8 hours to 3 hours
The plan is to connect Thessaloniki with Budapest within 6-7 hours
From Thessaloniki there is high speed railway down to Athens
Unfortunately, it is not an "EU project" but a Chinese one, but it still could be the backbone for your idea
6 hours could be realistic between Budapest and Sofia within 10 years via Nis
However, Budapest-Varna will probably take longer for a very long time
Sidenote: Majority of these lines ([on your map] unfortunately would be heavily underused and financially not sustainable
For example the Cluj Napoca, Sofia one
I am not comfortable with the idea of single big investments paired with corrupt regions
The M4 metro in Budapest was one of a lesson of that kind
I would not want a Panama construction to happen
However I am open ears for arguments
I think extending the line to Vienna would be unnecessary
If you want to go more west from Budapest you could just use the Railjet
Bold of you to assume comments from my country exist here
...i think you need to regroup Hungary to the Balkans
Sure we don't qualify geographically, but politically we fit right in
And as things go our old buddies in Poland are also preparinb to join that club
Defenestration
The act of throwing someone or something out of a window
Discombobulation is one too
In Hungary we even have a menthol candy called 'Negro' lol
There is a candy brand Negro
The candy itself is black, but the brand was named after its inventor Pietro Negro
we did for some time but it stopped a few years ago
it's a shame tho, it was really an experience to look through it
A few weeks ago I saw some santa Claus decoration in the local supermarket
Here, the presents brought by the baby Jesus, we do not have santa Claus
It was 13 of October
I haven't come across anti-German sentiment in Hungary
I mean we have some opinions, about Germany itself, but I've never met anyone holding a negative opinion towards Germans
Anti-French sentiment, however
Almost everyone I know has a negative opinions on French people for some reason
Absolutely not a thing in Hungary as much as I know
We see Germans more to be followed throughout history, unfortunately more during crazy times of history i.e. WW2
I never understood this Austrian sentiment that they're "not Germans". Your entire history revolves around being Germans goddammit
Being from Hungary, I would say your standing among us is pretty good, even though everyone knows that you are tasteless humorless cunts
That is not anti German though, we hate everyone in a different way
I have a quite strong anti german government sentiment
People like Germany here
Everything happens here based on German standards watered down, like institutions, university courses, they make ton more than us
Well, there is political disagreement regarding migrants, which Merkel pushed a lot in 2016, but I wouldn't say people hate Germans as a result, more like politically
Also, in 1989 after borders opened, there is some conspiracy theory, or truth, I don't know that there were signs in Germany saying "magyar ne lopj"(Hungarians, don't steal), to prevent looting from immigrants, but hey, at least my family got a new fridge and a TV:) ...
So yeah, some old crazy conspiracy theorists might still be angry with that
Otherwise, I don't think anyone hates Germany for WW, not even the elderly, they hate Russia more probably
And France for Trianon (besides neighbouring countries) if we want to go further
I personally don't know any Jewish people, or survivors, but we fought with Germany, so I guess it makes sense that the majority doesn't remember, and then everyone suffered under communists before 1956
>Almost everyone I know has a negative opinions on French people for some reason
One can only guess what might be one of the most common reasons
Sure, but why would that still be a valid reason today
Can't we just grow up
Not at all
The government is "anti-brussels" but loves Germany because of many (mostly automotive) german companies that have settled down here
We provide cheap, okay workforce for low amount of money (speaking in german standards)
The goverment is happy because they are creating many workplaces + the germans are happy because of the salaries they have to pay for the workers
Win-win situation
The govt
talks about Brussels instead of the EU because shitting on the EU still doesn't sit well with the majority
I. Not Hungary, but the government
It's them only who identify themselves with Hungary which is a rhetorical twist and your example shows that unfortunately it works, but it's still wrong
They don't represent the country, but their 3M voters only
They are not Hungary in the slightest, not even a majority
Why would be the EU equal to Germany or the other way around
The single idea is arrogant to me
Nevertheless, it is Germany and France who are the strongest columns of the construction of the EU, but there are 26 more countries, hence I see your equation arrogant
>Personally, I’d disagree
We tend to differentiate between being German and being germanic/German-speakers
Ever since ww2, yes
The fake narrative of "Germany's first victim" couldn't have worked without such take
>Pretty sure we actually fought a couple of wars with Germany/German states, so that we wouldn’t be Germany
For example
If my memory serves me right, the Austro-Prussian War (for example) wasn't quite about that
Pretty much the opposite, actually
The war was over the leadership of the German states, a position, which was held by Austria since centuries
>Back in the day of the empire, anywhere refered to as Deutsch-Österreich (German Austria) was just anywhere that was Austrian and spoke German
Almost every single "German-speaking Austrian" back then would had identified as simply being German
A German from Austria, that is
lmao
it's accurate
Sure, no worries at all
It is true though that governments including Germany represent their countries and voters, hence are naturally biased
The only long term solution is a federal Europe where national governments can't do politics that only serve them to keep them in power, but the only existing single government represents the whole of Europe as a single unified unit
To a lesser degree, I don't think bmw is fashionable here, but you can make triple the money in Germany as a hotel worker
Just thought it was funny:)
The Hell energy drink is actually Hungarian, I had no idea
I figured it's American or something, so I was quite surprised, when I learnt about it
Plot Twist, Red Bull is originally more Thai than Austrian:
> Austrian entrepreneur [Dietrich Mateschitz] was inspired by an existing energy drink named [Krating Daeng] which was first introduced and sold in [Thailand] by [Chaleo Yoovidhya] He took this idea, modified the ingredients to suit the tastes of Westerners,[\[11\]] and, in partnership with Chaleo, founded Red Bull GmbH in 1987 in Chakkapong, Thailand
In [Thai] *daeng* means red, and a [*krating*] (known in English as a gaur or Indian bison) is a large species of wild [bovine] native to South Asia
Yoovidhya's heirs own majority stakes in both brands, and they both use the same red bull on yellow sun logo while continuing to market the separate drinks to the respective Thai and Western markets
I actually thought puma is italian, because when i was younger the Italian national team had Puma kits, and they still do i think
Where’s it from
Only exists in Hungary
What
The actual Wiener Schnitzel is made from calf
Swindon is obsessed with Japan, it seems
God bless
And Wiener Schnitzel is a big thing in Hungary
Bigger than in Austria, I daresay
I know this is going to be too far below and you are probably not going to read this but let me propose a thought experiment
You are in the US, where the law enforcement costs billions of tax payer dollars
In some places it is ineffective, and sometimes there are allegations that they are racist/triggerhappy/corrupt etc
Now imagine that John from an imaginary economic and military superpower comes to you and you find out that they have private law enforcement
There are many insurances that cover different kinds of costs: most people can call a patrol car if there is a violent crime in progress but not an investigator if something is stolen from their home
There are people in this imaginary country who just dont call the cops when they are being robbed at gunpoint because it is cheaper not to
There are people who just close their eyes and hope for the best if they hear a noise at night
John argues that his way is better because the US law enforcement is racist and just costs billions of taxpayer dollars
His law enforcement is such much more effective anyway
How does that sound
Pretty crazy
Look, it is not like its all a perfect world over here
There are severe problems with healthcare in the less developed regions of Europe, much like how state law enforcement is not perfect either
But I would say about 90%+ of Europeans are just completely, completely baffled that we even need to discuss this
And it is not because 90%+ of us are socialists/communists, I can assure you ;)
As a heritage from socialism, we have one single state-owned health fund in monopoly and 7% is deducted out of every pay-check to fund it
The up side is that you get unlimited consultations, diagnostics and treatment for free
The down side is that due to massive tax-evasion, the system is extremely underfunded which results in hospital building literally in ruins, month long waiting lists, inadequate supplies and disgruntled medical staff
Those who can afford it end up attending private medical facilities with very high prices compared to local salaries to escape the often inhumane conditions while contribution to the health fund is still deducted from their salaires
These problems are all common in the post-Communist countries around here - but that is not unexpected
These countries, my own very much included, tend to suffer from institutionalised corruption after decades of Communist rule and the sudden Wild West of privatisation in the 90s; wages are low and EU membership means that in-demand professionals, such as nurses and doctors, can easily find work in faaaaar richer countries that are just a stone's throw away
These countries tend to have a rapidly ageing population as young people emigrate in masses: this puts a lot more strain on all social services, especially healthcare
But none of these problems apply to the United States
It's a rich superpower with huge amounts of resources, high wages, a reasonably healthy age distribution and no issues with brain drain
They should not be compared to Hungary or the Czech Republic - their standard should be Norway and Sweden
In Hungary, you must be insured under the national health insurance system
It is mandatory for everyone
Most people are insured through employment: 7% of your paycheck goes to the national health insurance system
If you are unemployed and receiving unemployment assistance, the state covers your health insurance
You can only receive unemployment assistance for up to three months at a time though and only if you were employed for at least 360 days in the previous three years
Certain groups are automatically covered:
\- anyone under the age of 18
\- students
\- pensioners
\- homeless people
\- parents who are receiving childcare assistance (in practice, these are mostly mothers staying at home with their newborns)
And a few more groups that I won't list :) Now, if you are not employed, not receiving unemployment assistance and don't belong to any of these groups, you MUST pay a monthly fee to be covered
This is not optional
The fee is, in 2020, is 7710 HUF per month - that is roughly €23
The cost of pharmaceuticals is quite high: there is no "prescription cap" like what exists in the UK
The state subsidises a lot of different types of drugs but for people with, say, chronic diseases, the cost can still add up to insane amounts
Private insurance exists and some employers offer it as a benefit
Private hospitals tend to be more modern and better equipped, but obviously, you have to pay
I think it's pretty clear that the US is a great place to live if you are educated, young, healthy and childless
Just, you know, never get sick
There are faaaaaaar bigger differences between European countries than in between US states
Let's look at GDP per capita (not a perfect measurement by any means but the most easily comparable we've got
I also discounted the two huge outliers: District of Columbia and Luxembourg):
- The "richest" US state is New York, the "poorest" is Mississippi
85700 vs 38000 dollars per capita
That's a 2
25 multiplier
Steep, no doubt
- The richest EU country - again, apart from Luxembourg - is Ireland, with $84800
The poorest EU country is Bulgaria with $9800
That's an 8
65 multiplier
But even the next two, Romania and Croatia with $12450 and $15500, respectively, are waaaaay behind Ireland
In fact, even the difference between these countries and Mississippi is bigger than the difference between Mississippi and New York
Basically, you did what most Americans tend to do (though your flair suggests you're not an American), you overestimate the diversity of the United States and underestimate that of Europe
(The EU numbers are IMF estimates, the US numbers are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis)
Perfectly safe, and great quality tap water here
I don't understand anyone who would buy bottled water, it sometimes tastes worse than tap, not to mention all the waste that bottles cause
Weirdly enough, there are a lot of people here who don't trust tap water because it "might contain harmful minerals". Even if that were the case, it would only indicate that your house needs better piping
Haven't drunk bottled water in years
Tap water is just as good
I drink tap water often, but I cannot tell how frequent that is
There is a map that shows the level of lead pollution in tap water (click on the region to see the details):
Not Brita but I did buy a Laica one for Christmas
Tap water is really hard here, doesnt taste good but the Laica filter makes it as good as bottled water
This is also the case here in Hungary to an extent
Non-sparkling water is like food without salt for me
Pretty much non-stop
I'm at a point where more often than not, what I say in Hungarian barely makes sense because I use English idioms and sentence structures
Very often, and vice versa too
Depends what my thoughts are in at that moment, if I'm thinking in Hungarian then I won't remember stuff in English and if I'm thinking in English I forget how to speak my own language haha
>But what worries me, as I read less and less in Polish, but continue to consume different media in English, I almost feel like my English vocabulary gets more and more sophisticated while Polish diminishes (case in point)
I had similar worries
Then i tried to talk about some of these "exotic" topic to my friends, and realized, that it does matter diddle all, that i don't know it in hungarian
&#x200B;
>Also for many topics I would straight-out feel uncomfortable talking in Polish because I feel like the vocabulary needed is crude or awkward, while in English this connotation is much weaker
...well hungarians had a similar problem with lacking words and expressions in the early 1800s - as latin was the language of the educated classes, the language of bureocracy, the language of science
Then came the language reform, so we have a drastically enlarged dictionary
Even some basic stuff like out stuff for beak "csőr" comes from that time, it was created by cső + orr (meaning pipe & nose)
I feel it was EXTREMELY succesfull, as the expression for physics, math ...etc
are far more intuitive than the english ones
For example "angular momentum" is perdület - and you get the jist of it without need for definition
And naturally some thing did go too far
People tried to make a new name for every damned element on the periodic table - NOBODY wants to learn that TWICE
Thankfully that didn't stuck
...do ethnic minorities lack linguistic autonomy in Latvia
(I mean here, you have anything from street signs to what ammounts to a parallel government - and currently we have VERY little minority population)
Well Austria is the balkans of the german world
Does is also hold true in matter other than linguistics
>We have some political pro-Russian parties, but one of them is just meh, would never vote for them, and another one always turned out to be in opposition despite gathering the biggest amount of voice
I feel that as a citizen I don't have voting rights if I don't vote for 'correct' political power
That is not a "minority" problem, that is a general problem with REPRESENTATIVE democracies, on all issues
See Biden vs
Trump
Here in Hungary as a member of a majority, i don't feel i have an option to pick where i would feel represented
&#x200B;
>I could drag on and on, but basically this is the result of post-Soviet Latvian goverment denying local Russian community citizenship which was promised in turn for supporting separation from USSR
We still have non-citizens here who refuse to take naturalization exam or learn the language properly
That goes against all kinds of international treaties most EU countries signed, and i assume Latvia did too
Well people are poeple everywhere
It took my grandparents to know about Trump, to acknowledge that the US is not "perfect promise land" just a big country
Too much hollywood movies does that to people in eastern europe
Talking about politics
Ends in a fight in most cases
Don't talk about the immigrants and Hungary's refusal of letting them in
Both of the factions (supporters and opposers) are so radical that you would probably start a whole civil war
Always accept pálinka if offered . It’s a sign of hospitality and it’s incredibly rude to decline
If someone invites you to their house you better accept the home made pálinka they offer you
whats the difference
(In hungarian the netherlands is called hollandia - ofc
Its thepolitically incorrect language with noone really getting whats wrong with néger)
>Seriously, we are not Germans
Ofcourse not
You're Bavarians after all
I know right
Upper Hungary is only correct for the mountainous parts, otherwise you're just simply North Hungary
Yeah, I mean I don't get this huge nationalism in Hungary
Everybody is blathering about our "lost territories", overlooking the fact that the majority of the people living there have never been Hungarian
Therefore, Hungarians living there should adapt or go to live somewhere else, not the other way around
There is a running joke in hungary marking things "Younger than Slovakia
" Even I found it a bit offensive
I would be interested in the opinion of someone from Slovakia about this
Btw the hungarian name of that part of the old country is "Felvidék", literally "Upper country"
Please
:-D
Yes please
People need to chill the fuck out, and accept that you cannot draw lines on the map thst separate ethnicities cleanly
Here close to the croatian border we have plenty of ethnic croatian villages, or ones with roots in croatian ethnicity
Same with hungarians on the other side of the border - and noone is freaking out over it
&#x200B;
The region called felvidek is not Slovakia, its in slovakia, but its certainly very far from being the whole of it
Even the rare batshit inaane irredentist "revert trianon" people dont contemplate annexing Slovakia
And for the sane majority its just the name of a region that used to be part of the contry
The distinction is made due to relatively small regions having unique customs within hunagry
(Before the age of modern transportation and telecommunication, and before modern concepts of nationalism, a LOT of regional customs developed - similarly to what you have in Austri, and people likethem)
Except Csallóköz and Székelyföld
>Hungary is beautiful place, your language is fucking difficult though man
Thanks
Could we give you that smelly horse [for some water, grass, and soil] Just a small gift
My catholic grandma is pretty nostalgic about  the times when all prayers, religious songs and ceremonis were in latin
Its like tahat EVERYWHERE in the islamic world
(That would make equating the current religious clusterduck with islam to the european reformation era wars even better of an analogy
We rank last in European real estate price change

Bold of you to write this
Germany entered the chat
TIL there's a country with even less press freedom than Hungary in the EU
Presumably Hungary
Probably not in face-to-face conversation, but mention the Treaty of Trianon anywhere online and Hungarians and our neighbours start fighting
No, not at all
I mean it's not like you go on random youtube video that even vaguely mentions Romania, Hungary, but especially Transylvania in any way and you find some Hungarian and Romanian nationalists starting shit and citing the same arguments endlessly
I have a Romanian friend, and after a tense arguement, we agreed that it's best if we just simply don't argue about history with each other lol
Also, on YouTube, I have yet to see a video about Hungary where Romanians/Slovaks don't taunt Hungarians with Trianon
No matter what the video is about, there will always be Slovaks and Romanian chanting "Viva Trianon" and other bs
Igen tudjuk, de a Kárpát medencében élő népek nem a városra gondolnak, hanem a békeszerződésre
I have not heard Italy or Spain to be associated with being ‘poor’. There are way ‘poorer’ countries in the EU than Italy or Spain, such the whole of the Eastern bloc basically
I think it´s a very good idea
There are sounds in Hungarian that are immensely difficult for foreigners to pronounce so I give them a pass
It still sounds horrible
Also they just can't grasp the proper intonation
[Here] the pronunciation is good but the intonation is all over the place
Like the guy in the hospital in the Usual Suspects
Horrible pronunciation
They could’ve used a native speaker
Yep
10 bonus points for the flawless "gy" sound but someone really should have taught him to always always always stress the first syllable
It's such an ironclad, easy to remember rule and immediately makes your Hungarian pronunciation a thousand times better
Hikers, cross country/downhill bikers, motorcyclists, and fishermen are about the only people who greet eachother while being perfect strangers
Until it's not Griass Di, you are not high enough :D
On my part, it's a citation from a sign I've seen in a Hütte - 'Griass Di - wei' üwa 1500m gibt's koa Sie'. Normally you'd greet others as Grüss Gott, but in the mountains you'll loose any formality, you'll be both informal and local, so it's just that
Mock bride kidnapping at all the wedding parties
This isn't really a crazy thing, but a weird one that shows that just how salty we are and mad about at all the invading countries in our history, but we still survived and have are own little things like this;
> It is considered rude to clink your beer glasses
Legend has it that when the 1848 Hungarian revolution against the Habsburgs was defeated, 13 Hungarian generals were executed, with the Austrians clinking their beer glasses after each execution
As a result, Hungarians vowed not to cheers with beer for 150 years - and while the time has passed, the custom remains
Eye contact is a must when Egeszsegedre-ing anything else, though
Corruption
Yeah, we had that too
This was totally common in Hungary, and I think, some people still do this
I can relate to this somehow
Look, you can still feel the vibe of the film, since you hear the original sound
If you want to learn a foreign language and/or you can´t read (your´re a child) or too lazy to read it´s the best solution for you
And people beating the police, not the other way around
And did you constantly screwed each other or not
I don't like my pasta _al dente_, deal with it
Except for climate-change protests, I assume
Do you mind when you´re sitting naked in the sauna and suddenly one of the following persons enters:
\- your neughbor

\- your dentist, etc
Grate soft smoked cheese all over and voila, your Italian dish is ready
They were never part of "Austria", only the Habsburg Empire; but they actually were part of the late Kingdom of Hungary, and it's really shame that they don't use the name _fröccs_ or some kind of variation of that (like "freč")
The last thing I want to see is my parents naked
Sure
Do you guys have to be naked to achieve this
We can do this with clothes on
It's a different culture that's all
Fair enough
That's a very likely scenario
All parents work for the feds I've heard

Not really refering to other coutries, but I think it's interesting
The word Hallo/Hello comes from the Hungarian langauge
When the first telephon exchanges were built by Tivadar Puskás, the workers used to start the conversation by saying "Hallom
" / "I hear you
" This is maybe the only commonly used Hungarian-based word
We've got the same thing, but with the English
"Angolosan távozni" - To leave like an Englishman
>ranlette espagnole
First I read "brainlet espagnole". That was an amusing half moment
According to wiktionary it comes from the middle English word "halou".
We say that too
Italians and Hungarians also say Englishman
There's nothing saying stuff like "this power lasts until *insert date here*" but it is said that he has this power until the pandemic is over
This means they can (and probably they will) lie about its presence, and make this period longer
His power isn't "unlimited". Honestly, the law they passed is unnerving (especially the part which affects the freedom of speech) but I think people overreact a little bit and many people seem to have limited (or no) understanding of what happened
He already had 2/3 of the votes in the parliament, there is nothing he can do now which he couldn't do before
He just had to jump through one or two mostly symbolic hoops
Anyway, the implications for the EU: As a European leader, I'd be excited to be honest
If FIDESZ doesn't deliver, people will vote them out
They gave Orban such extensive powers that there will be no one else to blame in domestic politics if he fails
They can easily lose the election if the economy collapses but even just losing the 2/3 in the parliament would be huge for the country
If FIDESZ delivers, there is one less country which has to be saved and they have no reason to keep up the emergency as they'll easily win the next election too
Much agreed
I can only suspect that towards the worse: once it's over many will find themselves without a job/income
That will rock the boat for practically everything and will most probably create turbulence at every level and from so many aspects we can't even foresee
Unleashed populism from the US, through Brazil, UK, Hungary, Poland an so on, don't all signal any good
These are more or less demanded by the societies around and these societies will not just sober up the following Monday, saying " ah let's just do something sensible". It will turn much worse before it gets any better
I hope I'm wrong
Orbán doesn't actually want out of the EU, not while we get lots of money from them anyway
Most of his rhetoric isn't actually directed at the EU (the EU is more popular among Hungarians than almost anywhere else), but at Brussels, which in Hungarian govt
communications is this vaguely defined, George Soros controlled bureaucratic great evil
He doesn't really care about ideology, only about stealing money for his family and friends
The whole state is set up to enrich them
As long as the EU is sending money, he can keep stealing
If funding was cut however, things could get interesting
He could, but that would hurt his own interests too
He has enough soft power to control the country without formalizing it like this for long, in 6 to 8 months he will give up these powers and he will not just be stronger but he will also be abel to prove how "democratic" he is
Cutting EU funds would be the most common solution, but for hungary's case there's an easier solution
Even a simple threat from the German multies can force Orbán to give up powers
Yeah, not having to get consent from parliament doesn't really matter when you have complete control over it anyway
The main concern is that anti-government journalists could get jailed for spreading "fake news", when in reality it is the government controlled media that is losing dozens of rectification lawsuits
The main reason why Fidesz was able to consolidate so much power is because the previous government royally fucked up the response to the 2008 financial crisis
Let us hope that this crisis will fuck them in turn
At this point, Jobbik aren't the far right party anymore, it's Fidesz
Most of Jobbik's far right members left to form Mi hazánk, which is just parroting Fidesz
Besides, we have center left parties as well, who cooperated with each other and Jobbik to make massive gains in the mayoral elections last autumn
To be fair there's also the Italians, and that one country that literally left the EU
But yeah, there are a lot of nationalists here, and they tend to hate the EU
> I’m honestly curious about why they seem to think this
It's a bit generous to say they think, they just parrot Russian propaganda
> I think something being glossed over here is suspension of all elections and referendums while the order is in effect, except the order has no expiration
That isn't accurate
Not "all" elections are suspended in the current form of the law
Our next general election is in 2022 and it isn't affected
Anyway, I think people still don't understand Orbán and what makes him dangerous if they are worried about him getting rid of elections
I'm not sure, honestly
EU funding is one of the main driving forces of the Hungarian economy, so it would definitely affect regular citizens, but it might help get rid of Orbán. Or he might use it to further entrench his power, who knows
Either way it's probably not gonna happen since Poland has got his back
Orbán and the boys are mostly being funded by the EU
I don't believe they would survive if the funding got cut
Any construction projects happen to go to companies owned by Orbán's friends and family, they all happen to be really expensive, and they all happen to run into extra costs along the way
Quite the coincidence
It's really not that hard to misuse EU funds
Edit: Here is an example from a New York Times article:
That's what I'm hoping for
The carcass of our opposition actually showed signs of life in the local elections when the economy was doing well so there is a tiny hope
The article isn't really accurate in a few places
It's hard to tell if they didn't have good sources or it's just sensationalism but, unfortunately, this is very common when it comes to Hungary (or I assume any other small country with a difficult to learn language)
Anyway, by elections and referendums are affected by the law, general elections aren't. That's a big difference
The first sentence is similarly inaccurate
The timeframe isn't indefinite, it's bound to the end of the pandemic
This obviously isn't ideal but it's an important difference
There will be a point when they can't claim anymore that there is a pandemic going on
My biggest issue with these inaccuracies is that they HELP Orbán. Every time he does something controversial and the media reports on it like this, he can just point out the mistakes/biased parts and claim that "the media owned by foreign billionaires is running a negative campaign against him".
It usually boils down to 1/3 of people supporting whatever Orbán does, 1/3 opposing it, and 1/3 being mostly apathetic to politics in general
I know for sure that those of us who generally oppose the government oppose this as well
All the opposition parties in the parliament voted against it too
As for those who don't care about politics or those who like Orbán I don't know, but I imagine this might raise a few eyebrows amongst them as well
In the movie _Chicago_, in the Cell Block Tango where the supposedly Hungarian "Katalin" is telling her story
In "Hungarian".
The thing is, the actress was Russian, and she clearly didn't speak Hungarian at all
So, it is barely comprehensible even for a native Hungarian, only some words; but there were complete lines I had to look up
It's not gibberish, it is a somewhat meaningful story, it's just so badly pronounced that it doesn't sound like anything
90% of the time when a character in a moovie speaks hungarian I don't even realise, only on like the 3
time I watch it
Even then it's a mistery what the whole sentence was
They always try to speak with a slavic accent
Like, why did they choose hungarian if they are not going to put the tiniest effort into it
Yeah, right, becouse there aren't a lot of people speaking hungarian
Regardless, it is pretty common compared to our country's popularity that a random character speaks hungarian in a moovie, but it's almost never done correctly and almost always spoke with a slavic accent
Theres a scene in the series Zoo where a guy who mutated into a beast was hungarian and took a last video of himself saying goodbye to her loved one but if you hear it once, you can barely understand it
I watched the series on Netflix in German so I don't know how it is in other languages
A comedian once said the opposite: "I was so drunk one time that I was able to understand the language of the animals for an hour and a half
Ah yeah, the scouse accent
Big Liverpool FC fan and luckily got the chance to see the team play against Napoli in the UCL
I spent 2,5 days in Liverpool
By the 3rd day I started getting the hang of the accent, but the first day was just straightup terrible
The lad in a Taco Bell asked me if I wanted 'chicken or beef' and I answered with a confident 'yes'...
Az igen
Volt néhány mondat amit sikerült elkapni, de aztakurva, voltak olyanok is amiket többszöri meghalgatás után sem lehet érteni
Yes, they have some accent, but it's genuine and well comprehensible
Btw, the video's really funny, since it's about that the original voice track and the subs are more or less correct; but the Hungarian dubbing uses some kind of amusing caricature redneck accent to indicate the difference between the "English" and the "Hungarian" parts
:D More precisely: the Americans speak standard Hungarian, and the Hungarians speak redneck Hungarian
And the lines themselves are also not the same
I'm sorry
Where are you from, what made you learn Hungarian

I've definitely noticed interclass relationships are much more normalized in Western Europe than in our region

Net per capita monthly income above 6000 NOK is considered rich
Is it not common in Norway to reach that level
If the median wage is above this, then people are actually rich

I read vacation two times and was very intrigued
Btw I really support it, it is also mandatory here too
Anti-wax and just an ignorant moment that gains ground if there is a problem with education
Good move
Humans live in communities
If we have the means to fight contagious deseases and it takes everyone to participate than we must all be a part of it
Yes, I support mandatory vaccination
Unless you live in a remote farm, you inevitably encounter a lot of people every day - co-workers, people on public transport, people in stores, and so on - and you have no right to wilfully endanger those people, and they have no right to wilfully endanger you either
I disagree with any religious or similar exemptions, too, for the same reason: it has an impact on others unless you live as an extreme shut-in which is just not realistic
I hope more countries will follow Germany in this question
I’d gladly have anti-vaccination criminalised and the act of spreading anti-vaccination propaganda constituted as endangering and misleading the public
I’m not sure if I’d say it’s terrorism, but maybe in certain cases it could be
Same, you have to take them every year
That's why many people don't work in most of December
But some workplaces alow you to not take it but rather revive a big premium at the end of the year
During the renovation of a historical place boards with information were placed there with text in both Hungarian and English, but the English "translation" on all of these boards was [Same in English]
Restaurant mistranslations are really common, a well known one is "fuckup with marmalade" which is a pastry filled with jam (lekváros bukta), but "bukta" also means failure in other contexts
Just a few days ago I saw one (it was posted to r/engrish I think
) saying "virgin coins" which is a mistranslation of pork tenderloin medallions
Not English and technically not a translation either but [this sign] is one of my faves - they wanted to translate it to Serbian but probably forgot to switch the source language to Hungarian in google translate so instead of weird inaccurate machine translated Serbian text they ended up with a Cyrillic transliteration of the Hungarian text
This is the 1st time I see it
Good luck with democracy, I hope the transition will be successful unlike for many formerly authoritarian states
Do you think something will actually change
Or will the next president just maintain the status quo
We know that change is a lie
Good luck then, I hope you grab the opportunity
Budapest here, I wasn't even aware that some people put our city and Prague in the same category as Ibiza and Amsterdam
Anyway, I don't care
Most of the partying is restricted to a few neighborhoods and it doesn't annoy the rest of the city
My job doesn't depend on tourism and I don't party in these places
Change our image or not, I'm fine
That said, there is a type of tourism I want to get rid of ASAP: English bachelor parties
They are fucking obnoxious, regularly harass women and they occasionally try to fight each other/anyone they find
Bonus answer: I'm one of the few Europeans who genuinely enjoyed Las Vegas
However, I don't think the concept would work here
I agree, I think the landmarks attract many more tourists than the party district
When I read the post's title I immediately thought of those bachelor party groups lol
I mean you have great beer in any place you sit in, which is often cheap too
And nowadays we have quite a few tourists compared to the pre-covid times
yeah I don't think many locals go to the party district
When I was there, that's what I did all day, I kinda thought of that as partying
then again I'm central European poor guy, so I tried to avoid expensive places
It was around 30°C today, and will continue to rise in the weekend
Fortunately, it's dropping a lot at night, so I usually just leave my window open to let the temperature to cool down in the house and then close it in the morning to keep the "cold" inside
Here in Hungary in the morning it was raining so everyone put on their coats and then it turned boiling hot
I dont know, its average where i live, actually there was a lot of heavy thunderstorm like 1-2 weeks ago
Yeaaaaah we are fine
\*dies of heatstroke\*
But seriously the nights are the worst
The days are fine since you can go somewhere
The worst thing is that there were like code red/orange storms right above  our city but my grandma's city was fine 20 kilometres away
And now there is like 36 celsius heat
Cmon weather fix urself
After suffering through many hot summers, I just ordered AC to be installed in my house yesterday
It's half past twelve and already more than 30°C, and humidity is pretty high, too (45 %)
There have been severe thunderstorms (with flash floods and funnel clouds) in the country these days, but none in Budapest
And it isn't forecast for today and tomorrow
And this summer hasn't been particularly hot so far
My sister jokingly said that we don't have seasons that lasts for months anymore, but seasons that lasts for days; one day it's raining, next day there's snow, third day it's really cold, then it's like summer again
30°C isn't really considered that hot here to be honest, it's an average summer temperature
It's more of the humidity that's extra bothersome right now
It's currently at 77%
Yeah, I'm allright, got a bit wet from the Rain and when it stopped I got sweaty
But it's only gonna get worse
Well I just stayed inside in bad weather and go outside in good weather
I usually go outside with the dog
The poor thing isn't being walked really (since none of us are home)  so he is so excited that he grabs the leash and walks himself
I sleep with only the covers of my blanket (the outside part) so I don't boil myself
You see our house's interior is lined with wood so it keeps in heat
So we just open windows like 10 degrees (like yknow degrees in math
You can open windows like that by flipping the knob up and pull)
There will be rain the next week which means mosquitoes
And heat
Good thing I have a fan
Which part is scary to you
Temperature usually gets up to 35+°C for weeks in summer, hopefully with low humidity
You can get used to it
And I think Hungary is generally more equipped with AC than Western Europe because of the climate
Severe storms happen in Hungary, but they usually cause property damage (lighting strikes, fallen trees etc); life-threatening danger is quite rare; although there was a woman who drowned in a flash flood few weeks ago, but that's extremely rare
One or two unfortunate people get struck by lightning every year
So we rather welcome storms, as they bring some refreshment in the heat
England, The Low Countries, Germany and Italy are in the "Blue Banana", the most populated and well developed area of Europe
France is next to it
You should not compare your whole country to those

Oh my god yes
I'd be very interesting in reading her mum's diaries
Hahaha I find it adorable :D
Ózd
(even the name has an unwelcoming tone)
It's a mining/steel milling city that has been uplifted by the old communist regime, under the delusional Stalinist goal that we'll become the "country of iron and steel", even though our whole history was centered on agriculture
As you can guess, after the iron curtain fell, the whole state-owned steel production industry went down the drain
Being one of the poorest towns, the city consists mostly of grey, ten story concrete panel houses, a few scattered churches, and a big-ass gypsy colony
You can judge by those facts how cheerful living there must be
Ózd in North-East Hungary
Used to be a major metallurgy centre
Absolute unite of dreadfulness and depression
On the flip side it is located in a wonderful environment, surrounded by beautiful hills
I kinda like brutalist architecture, but not really the post industrial decay, so I would like to nominate my hometown, Ózd:
The most depressing fact about the town that after 1989 and the de-industrialization they had to choose another spot as "town center", because the earlier one was the metallurgical plant itself
All of our towns have at least some of these fucking ugly satellite state era buildings but I was about to nominate Ózd too
It just looks sad and dystopic
Worst part
The location/scenery is absolutely great and it could be a gem if not for this weird forced industrialization
It's interesting because in Borsod, a city is either beautiful, or ugly af, there is no inbetween
> Article A)
> The name of OUR COUNTRY shall be Hungary
Article 1
The State of Hungary is a republic
Just the 1st one in itself doesn say much
So for fun fact heres the 2nd:
Article 2
(1) The Republic of Hungary is an independent, democratic constitutional state
(2) In the Republic of Hungary supreme power is vested in the people, who exercise their sovereign rights
directly and through elected representatives
(3) No activity of any person may be directed at the forcible acquisition or exercise of public power, nor at
the exclusive possession of such power
Everyone has the right and obligation to resist such activities in such
ways as permitted by law

Definitely this one-
Taken in spring during the first wave, our dear PM decided to visit some hospitals, this picture shows a lot of things:
-the PM has the better quality mask
-the doctor can't even wear it properly
-the walls are collapsing
-the lift doesn't work
-and the fire extinguisher is just laying on the floor randomly lol
Idk how that happened but I fixed it lol
Duránda
The river is rotting
On the street there are dead cats, dead dogs
The children are eating those things that are decomposing hardly
And they didn't even paint the water tower
Is this the moment, when I either say Transylvania or Upper Hungary to piss of the Romanians/Slovaks
Sounds just like most of Hungary, what coincidence
Well, there you actually already live with the Danes
Makes one shudder
akiket a rendszer bedarál, ez az énközpontú rendszer
Mother in law bad, Trianon bad, Romanian bad, pálinka good
Well here in northern Pest county it's relatively alright actually, but yeah the border regions to the east of here are some of the poorest in the country
Hungary and Slovakia should work together more
A common project in the region would be more effective, than the indepentent, neglecting approach
I loved Galicia
The moderate weather there was a long-awaited blessing after the insufferable desert that is called Castille-León.
Milyen énközpontú rendszer
it's the southeast area that is flat as hell, and it's also really large compared to the entire country
Yeah true, especially for Somogy county
It has a lot of hills
Ah yes, historical determinism
My favourite
Hát amit azért hoztam létre, hogy ne kerüljek trébe
It's not very major, but Matthias Corvinus conquered Vienna in 1485 and it became the new capital for a decade
Maybe the Pan-European Picnic
Now, I would consider this a big event for all of Europe as it was the first time the Iron Courtain was cut, and people were allowed to enter "The West" freely for the first time
The event was popularized among East Germans with posters written in German, and thus a lot of them decided to travel to Hungary
About 300 East Germans fled to the West during the picnic, while thousands were waiting for another possibility like this near the other parts of the country
The Hungarian government once again re-enforced border regulations and thousands of arrests were made until one incident, where an East German man has been shot by a border guard
This was a turning point, and a decision was made against the likes of the Soviet Union and East Germany, the borders were to be open again on September 10th
This was the first time a Warsaw Pact country permanently opened its borders with the West, East Germans escaped to the West en masse and indirectly led to the fall of the Berlin wall
So yeah, cool topic
Maybe the Siege of Belgrade in 1456
Or the siege in 1521, for that matter
Belgrade was the key fortress of the Hungarian defense system, which protected the country from the Ottomans
The siege of 1456 was a huge triumph, where Mehmet II, the same guy who conquered Constantinople was beaten back
The siege of 1521 was the complete opposite
The city fell, and the road to Mohács was paved
I don't think many know about how Hungary ended up as a Habsburg 'colony', or the tensions the two states/nations had from the getgo, or the independent Transylvania of the time
The Aster Revolution of 1918 is a very close second, because even Hungarians have a warped image of it with all the politically motivated misinformation about it, first by the Horthy government, then the communists, then now the shadow of the socialist era
There's very little trustworthy literature about it
I would say the 1848-49 war for freedom is not that well known
Most only know of the revolution i presume
By "long" time, do you mean 1993 or something like Svätopluk
I was 8 years old that year
It wasn't that **long** ago
We know about it
Hungary accepted lots of Greek refugees at that time
We even have a town called Beloiannisz (the Hungarian spelling of Nikos Beloyannis' name) which was once exclusively, nowadays partly inhabited by Greeks
We are grateful for bringing authentic Greek food (like real gyros, souvlaki and tzatziki) to our country
:) The best gyros in Budapest is made by a Greek couple whose parents (? or other relatives) fled from Greece back then
Once my friend told me that when he was having an oral exam in history, there was another guy who was asked to name the participating countries in WW1
He mentioned the big ones, then Portugal, after which the teacher literally counted it as a MISTAKE, because according to her Portugal was neutral
Yes, the examiner teacher from history didn't know that Portugal was actually in the war
Part of
Wasn't it more like a personal union
When did you hear me say Hungary was the only one
You must be 12
Or compared to the Kingdom of Hungary which existed for more than 900 years
It was so strange that when we were in France they put a pitcher of tap water on our table in every restaurant without even asking for it, and refilled it when it was empty
This is unheard of in Hungary, why would they provide something for free that would potentially cut into their profits
Of course they'll give you tap water for free if you ask for it, but I imagine that you'd get the same reaction as you got
Next level: drinking wine from those cheap promotional coca cola glasses that you get for free if you buy six at once
A well-known Hungarian song goes smth like: "it's scandalous that the criminal code does not consider vbk (equivalent of kalimotxo) a crime against humanity"
It's same in Hungary, but sometimes they just can't check if you're a customer
In some places give customers a code written on the receipt which you can open the door
d + z + s is one letter and it makes a J sound (English J)
I'm not sure if this is a unique feature, but Hungarian city names use different endings for "in" for places that are within and outside the territory of historical Hungary
For example, there is a town called Velence in Hungary, and the Hungarian name for Venice, Italy is also Velence
However, "in Velence, Hungary" is "Velencé**n**", while "in Venice, Italy" is "Velencé**ben**".
The letters ő and ű, I'm pretty sure they're unique to Hungarian
Good luck finding fonts that include them
We have letters which consist of two letters, and there is even a letter with three symbols
And unlike in other languages, they are a normal part of the alphabet and they all have their own unique sounds
Due to vowel harmony and because the "e" is the most common vowel in Hungarian, we can express almost everything using only "e" vowel
For example, here is our hymn in eszperente (the name of this thing):
>Nemzetemet ne vesd el,
>egek fejedelme;
>segedelmezd kezeddel
>seregekkel szemben
>Ezerszer lett megvetett,
>de szeretve lehet,
>elszenvedte e nemzet
>jelent meg egyebet
It might sound a bit weird, and has a bit different meaning, but it's possible :D
We use the following letters regularly: á, é, í, ó, ő, ö, ú, ű, ü, and of course "dzs", "gy", "sz" "zs" and "cs" which all count as one letter
Polish has dzi for dzs although they don't count it as one word
However except for maybe Taiwanese (they have weird letters), we are probably the only language who uses ő, ű characters
And then there's "Pécsett" lol
Like in literally every language besides English
We can build the same structure, but it would be separated by a space because our rule is that if it's not common usage then we write it separately, but the same exists
*Bilderrahmenzerhacken* \- festőkeret vágás.
...and search for [the singer named "fekete pákó" trying to pronounce "pöttyös labda" (spotted ball) and tücsök (cricket)] to see somebody suffer trying to make that sound
Yeah but that's not unique to Turkish
This is actually a different thing than what op described and happens in most agglutinative languages
How the F is hungarian based on latin
NONE of our simple words that describe stuff in primitive rural life have anything to do with latin
As such its pretty apparent that the word we used earliest in our history as a linguistic group, predate latin
Our latin rooted words are mostly related to things like school, church ...etc
which only became part of our culture after settling in hte carpathian basin
The real question is how we write it out phonetically  and the answer is "hagen daz".
And of course people will pronounce it wrong in all sorts of ways
Not only Slavic ones
Hungarian nouns can have up to 36 different forms
Really
good to know
Hungarian also has merre - which way
>Heck, even the 'most Hungarian' of things -their traditional bows have Sarvet - Czarvek
Siyah in english
Just to point out one of the most obvious similarities
You mean "szaru"?
Words describing stuff related to hunter gatherer life long predate bow useage, and they are off fino ugric origin, words like hal, or other stuff listed here:  [
Whats next are you going to tell me that "Hello" is also an evidence for English and Hungarian being related
>!The phrase originates from Bell's hungarian lab assisstant saying "hallom" ("i hear it" in hungarian), on recieving voice
The EU is planning to abolish daylight savings time
While the final decision is yet to come, would you prefer keeping summer time or winter time
Why
I prefer winter time, bucause summer time was made up so more energy is saved, if we abolish the change we should go back to the original time
Hungary is one of the few countries that might be better off using summer time, being quite close to the border between UTC+1 and UTC+2
Someone even made a detailed breakdown why GMT+2 would be the best for Hungary:  (in Hungarian)
Or if we want to go a bit ridiculous, we could use UTC+1:30
:-D
EDIT: An article from the aforementioned page, in English, comparing time zones for Central European cities:
I hear you, I really do, but it’s not just loss of one hour, but a week if not weeks of being miserable, sleepy and kept afloat by caffeine because my whole sleeping cycle is messed up twice a year
I always envied those who weren’t affected by the time change as I am
>biannually
That means every two years
The word you are looking for is "semiannually".
Also Ukraine, Moldova and the entire Balkans
Let's assume Barcelona, based on your flair
Geographically correct time zone (UTC+0):
* 21 June: sunrise at 4:18, sunset at 19:28
* 21 December: sunrise at 7:13, sunset at 16:24
Staying on winter time (UTC+1):
* 21 June: sunrise at 5:18, sunset at 20:28
* 21 December: sunrise at 8:13, sunset at 17:24
Staying on summer time (UTC+2):
* 21 June: sunrise at 6:18, sunset at 21:28
* 21 December: sunrise at 9:13, sunset at 18:24
Of course, this would mean wildly different times for someone living in A Coruña, where solar time is 40 minutes less compared to Barcelona, i.e. everything happens 40 minutes later
Haha, yes I am
If I stay up late, and I don’t get to sleep as much as I’m used to, for sure I have the same issue the next day, or days if I don’t manage to catch up on sleep
The time change is a bit different though, it’s like not getting enough sleep for a week at least, so it messes up my sleep cycle/patterns a bit
Maybe I should go to bed an hour earlier
but then again, this discussion is about the impact this has on individuals and whether it could be done away with
Then I was wrong, sorry
UTC+0 is probably the worst option here, even though that would be geographically fitting
For Barcelona, both winter and summer time seem good, but considering the whole of Spain, UTC+1 (winter time) seems to be the best (in my opinion)
(EDIT3: However, that would mean an 8:50 sunrise in A Coruña in late December
~~EDIT: Or maybe not
UTC+2 would mean a really late winter sunrise in the east, and a comfortable schedule for the west
UTC+1 would mean an early summer sunset for the west, and a comfortable schedule for the east
Spain could have two timezones, maybe
UTC+1:30
~~ It really depends on personal preferences
EDIT2: Sorry, I have no idea if what I'm writing makes sense
Time zones are a really confusing thing, and I'm a bit too tired to think clearly
This is a shared one, but the connection between Polish and Hungarian people is one of the strongest in the world
This is mostly because of the similiarities between our history and some other factors as well
We even have a Polish-Hungarian friendship day on the 23rd of March
And to all the Polish people reading this: love you guys
Hungarian bus drivers always greet/wave at/flash at each other when they meet on the road, regardless of which company and sector they work in
In addition bus drivers working companies that operate other vehicles (such as the Budapest Trasport Co
BKV which has trams etc) will greet their colleagues driving those
Tram drivers use their left turn signals when passing each other to say "hello" (which is definitely not conforming the highway code, but they do it anyway)
We also have Tiszavirágzás!

Halászbástya - Fisherman's Bastion
The view is not bad, but it's not that different from any other place in the Castle District
The building isn't old, it was finished in 1902, it just mimics the Roman style
I think it's a kitsch
You have to pay to get in
Budapest itself
Don't get me wrong, it has some really fascinating landmark, but there's not much original building left to look at
Post-WW1, WW2 and the revolution in 56 had it's toll on the city
Aside the old bridge, the Buda Castle (i wouldn't recommend tho, Orbán claimed it for himself), the parliament and several other buildings are fascinating, but the rest of the city is just boring
One of my Estonian friend took us to a place something with the name Wilhelm in it I cant remember exactly and it was fantastic and no tourists knew about it apparently, we had such a great time in Tallinn
What do you mean by "original building"? What is old enough for you
I think it's really cool that several districts of the inner city in a broader sense (like almost until Dózsa György út - Fiumei út - Haller utca) consists of the old style condominium buildings and many parts still live as a city, not just a museum or a puppet theatre as for example Prague
Sure, the poorer parts of Józsefváros aren't the nicest, but gentrification isn't always a positive thing
I would have said the Puszta
There's literally nothing there
It's the plains in Eastern Hungary
Budapest compared to that is the most wonderful place on Earth
You are not allowed to answer
Edit: Thanks anon for the silver, I hope you are a poor Norwegian
Just went there on Sunday
It's the same all day right now ;)
The office of the ministerpresident was moved from the Parlament to a monastery in the Castle district
Personaly I don't see it as a problem, but many do and they have many reasons for that
The office of the M. president was moved to the Parlament during the communist era, nowadays the current governement trying to erase communist "traditions" and legacy, so they are bringing back pre-communist things
The residence also costed a lot of money, and there are big parties there for the governement friendly elite
They built an extra balcony what isn't part of the historical view of the castle and many didn't like that
It also costed a huge pile of money, but at least they spent it on something what could move forward the country
I don't mind that the office of the ministerpresident was moved, I think the legislative and the executive powers shouldn't be in the same house
It used to be popular in the eighties and nineties among German tourists
No idea how they did the marketing back then
I talked to Germans to ask what the appeal was, they said the romantic endless plains where you can ride away in the sunset and eat spicy, fatty food, drink local wine
It isn't communist itself, but the action of moving the office of the mpr
to the Parlament was done by the communists, so it had to go
I'm not that nacionalistic, and I don't hate the Romanians from the bottom of my heart
I don't want to revive Greater Hungary
But I do hate the treaty of Trianon
I'm not a nationalist and I'm not pessimistic either, but I have to admit that I love paprika and pálinka
Also, I definitely don't consider myself racist, I've traveled to lots of countries (started it at a very young age), so I think I'm used to foreigners and different cultures
And also, I have a few Romanian friends :)
I'm a pretty bad Hungarian
I'm not nationalistic, I don't constantly cry about Trianon and I don't want to "reclaim the lost lands". I actually hate pálinka, but I guess I do like paprika
I don't like gulyás, though
I'm not pessimistic either
EDIT: I'm also not homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic and racist, since that's become more and more common in Hungary over the last few years, sadly
Soo
•I’m vegan and grew up mostly vegetarian
• I’m a leftist, as far from our government rn as possible
• Good at foreign languages
•Care about my health
On the other hand I am pretty pessimistic and am kind of a loner
Also I’ve lived in switzerland for while now so that might’ve infuenced some of these
I don't live on the Puszta, haven't ridden a horse in years, don't sport a mustache, but can actually make a badass gulyás (and no, you're probably not doing it right
Nobody does
Okay but who doesn't enjoy going to IKEA
Pretty relaxing
I imagine you shouting from a castle battlement
*"Your mother was a hamster, and your father smells of elderberies"*
Do you also drive a rally car to work
>. I don't want to revive Greater Hungary
I think majority of us don't?
Same, but I'll add not being racist and homophobic to my list
Sadly the majority are these things, since most of Hungary consists of older people, who think that the only good way of life is a white Hungarian cishet marriage with preferably 4-6 kids
Yay other decent hungarians who arent right wing
We’re a rare sight :(
Well, it's a bit complicated
As Romania entered WW1 in 1916(?) They took us by surprice (then we did march into Bucharest tho)
Most likely why most people hate, or just don't like Romanians, is that in 1919( I'm going off of memory here) invaded us with the Czechoslovaks and the Yugoslavians
Now, as far as I remember, all forces had a demilitarised zone, but the romanians marched all zhe way to Budapest
Oh yeah, and probably Transilvania played a role in this ( as that there are about 100000 hungarians there)
Yes, Trianon is rooted deep in Hungarians, it’s being taught since childhood
There’s a lot of Hungarians who are nationalistic and right wing, and want to reclaim greater Hungary
This being said, if we have to mention cliches: I don’t like paprika, nor am I over the moon about palinka
I am however a pit pessimistic (as most Hungarians) and I am not overweight (apparently we’re 4th worldwide in obesity rate)
The most people I talked to about this did want to get our 'rightful land' back
( bare in mind that they were older people)
Greater Hungary is a small brain ambition
Big brains aim for the restoration Austria-Hungary(in some form or other)
Yes, I forgot that
And it's sad that most people think like that
I've once met a Pole in Berlin who hated Germans
And when I told him I loved Germany, he called me a Nazi
I tried to understand his logic, but I failed
Its not that people dislike goulash
However its often seen as an overhyped stereotype, as whe have plenty of other dishes that are just as nice
And it gets eeally old really fast when everybidy always wants goulash
Not to mention bastardized versikns that one can come across in foreign lands - which are not goulash (which is a soup), they far more closely resemble pörkölt
Btw
if you liked goulashyou should try halászlé (~fisherman's soup), which is somewhat similar
And which spoiled me towards pretty much all fish soups i  ever eaten in south slavic cou tries
Otside the sterotype we have plenty of pasta like based dishes, and wide variety of vegetable stews,and soups (which are too often missing from other cuisines)
And naturqlly we share some stereotypical popular balkans stuff like stuffed cabbages ...etc
It's nothing special, there are much better but less popular dishes in our national cuisine to be honest
But in general, I don't really like too much paprika, too much grease and I don't like it if a food makes you unable to do just about
anything after you eat it, and it bloats you
Lángos is like this, too, so it's a rare occasion when I have it, but at least it tastes good
That's understandable I guess
But I'm pretty sure the younger generation doesn't give 2 fucks about taking Transylvania back lol
> the cradle of our nation
Were not the Principalities the primary site of forming the Romanian nation both culturally and politically
Yea
as I said, I was going off of memory, and my history teacher wasn't that great
Talking about annexing Transsylvania, or any other territory is just a plain fucking stupid agenda, that politicians pull out of the hat to pander to idiots (then again, EVERY nation in the CEE has those)
But as Hungarians, visiting Transsylvania is a somewhat enlightening experience for us, to connect with our living ancestry, to experience a simple, more rural and raw aspect of our culture, and to get to know brothers and sisters from a diaspora far away
The connection to Transsylvania is and shouldn't be a political, but a personal, transcendental one
And I'm saying that coming from an almost fully  Schwäbisch-Slavic background
Csak a magad nevében beszélj
Forgive me father, for I have sinned
That's no excuse
I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying that gulyás is overrated
Because it is
I mostly like Hungarian cuisine
These stereotypes are more common in older generations and poor or lower-middleclass families
Are you - or is any other Romanian - a Dacian
The Vlach migration and timeline is supported by tangible historical (various royal privileges) and linguistic evidence (eg
Aromanian-speaking remnants all along the Balkans), as is the formation of the distinct Romanian culture and nation in the Principalities since the medieval period
While the Huns are a very interesting (and given the striking lack of any first-hand or archeological evidence, quite mysterious) people, no evidence points to a direct connection between either modern or historical Hungarians and the Huns
(There's also a lot of theories of the 'might have been'/'one cannot definitely exclude the slight possibility of' kind, but I presume that's the same with Dacians and Romanians
What is the distinguishable Dacian contribution towards Romanian culture, the Romanian language or the long history of the Romanian Principalities
I'm pretty sure Vlach, Slavic or even German and Hungarian strata could be easier to identify
What does 'it' refer to and how does a particular hypothesis having its own name attest to its veracity
>Are you trying to say Hungarians have a better claim over Transylvania
Perhaps
Are you saying that Romanians have no claim whatsoever just  because the Dacian influence isn't blatantly visible
That's a lazy  take
Are you saying that the Romanians as a nation came into existence  in the 19th century
Not a lie
Are you saying that Romanians as a  people didn't exist before the Middle Ages
Wrong
So, what is your  discourse
I'm discussing your previous claim that Transylvania is "the *cradle* of the Romanian nation". Nothing else - I am especially avoiding the claim business
It seems that neither the language of, nor the precursor polities to the Romanian nation were formed in Transylvania, nor the earliest or most important cultural, historic (etc
) achievements of Romanians were accomplished there, despite of well-attested and long-term presence of Romanians
>As for cultural and historic achievements, do you honestly believe all  of them went on record when Romanians in Transylvania weren't the ruling  population
What makes Transylvania the cradle of the Romanian nation, especially *over the Principalities*?
>As for cultural and historic achievements, do you honestly believe all  of them went on record when Romanians in Transylvania weren't the ruling population
Records pointing toward Romanian national identity forming in the Principalities are some way evidence that said national identity was formed not only elsewhere, but under comically terrible, horrible oppression
What's the point of getting over the top with this
Using the phrase '*the* cradle' does, in fact, single the referred object out from all other objects (incl
the Principalities)
'*A* cradle' - or an even more neutral phrase expressing its significance, eg
'an important place' - would have been clearer and would have probably avoided the verbal exchange altogether
>where you don't have tone of voice, inflection, mimic and other non-verbal cues
Yes, this certainly did not help
> I didn't mind the exchange itself but it felt like both of us were becoming slightly hostile towards the end
Shall we agree to both of us answering 'yes' to OP's question, then
A certain episode of the classic Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles comes in mind, where the four turtles ended up in Budapest, and the first thing they did was frighten a caravan full of colorfully clad gypsies, only to eat their goulash afterwards
At the end, Michelangelo made "Pizza goulash", which alone sounds like heresy
We also had a Macgyver episode set in Budapest
Actually, it was the first thing came to my mind when I saw the question
There were Arabs and camels everywhere, I think they confused it with Baghdad
I was looking for this comment
Si, certo, that was implied
Probably from Pamplona
Americans can't really make a difference between countries that speak mexican
(please don't hit me)
That level of heresy is intolerable
Okay, that's it
I call EXTERMINATUS
"OH, YOUR HUNGARY, WHY DON'T YOU EAT
How fucking many times I have heard that
At my grandmother’s funeral I met with her cousin for the first (and hopefully last) time
He was your stereotypical crazy “nationalist” type with his “big Hungary” badge (basically Hungary before Trianon) and shaved head
Anyway he proceeded to tell me one of the craziest conspiracy theories that I’ve ever heard
Basically he believes that the Hungarian was the first civilisation on earth and all great civilisations like sumerian came from them
The ancient Hungarians conquered Europe before the Roman Empire but they got bored and decided to see what was on the east
And they only came back to Europe in the 10th century
He wholeheartedly believes that this is a proven fact and the freemasonry is doing everything to keep this a secret from us
I'm not sure if it's a conspiracy theory, but many people im Hungary genuanly belive, that hungarians were the "creators" of mesopotamian, romance and egyptian culture
Many people also thinks that hungarians are descendants of an intergalactic civilsation from the Sirius system, and we are here to fight the lizard people
I guess this shit is comeing from the "Hihetetlen" (means unbelievable/shocking) magasine
It is a hungarian conspiracy magasine, and I'm pretty sure the creators doing this as a joke, but many people reads it unironically
Those guys are built a fantasy world, that created a whole sub-culture in Hungary
I have once read a theory that somehow ended up saying that Japanese people are the closest relatives to Hungarians
I don't quite remember how they got there (probably scrutineering both languages and finding words that are pronounced similarly and very minor grammatic similarities) but it was pretty crazy
That's only the second part of the story
The reality is that there were no humans on earth until we arrived from outer space
Our spaceship was lead by Prince Csaba ("Csaba Királyfi csillagösvényen"), and landed at the Carpathian Plain, which made a huge crater and caused the mountains to form
The engine of the spaceship is still here and acts as the heart chakra of the world
Hungarians came from the Sirius and fought against aliens over Crete at 12000 BC
By the way this conspiracy is real, I'll edit this later to link the conspiracy site from which all of these coming
some people think that these pyramids are built by Hungarians
Turbo-hungarians think hungarian is the mothertongue of all languages
Edit: They call it the ancienttongue, and they base it on the idea hungarian didn't change that much
The only problem is that we only have a couple of sources for early hungarian (conquest-1526) and non for pre-conquest hungarian
That's true that hungarian didn't change much, but the observable period is really short (around a 1000 years) and they only compare the language to english and german, when the ancientness of hungarian comes up
Yes we originated from planet Sirius
My favorite part is when the Dalai Lama was in Hungary, they asked him if the heart chakra of the Earth really was in Hungary
He smiled and he told that every nation wishes to feel themselves special but the real buddhist way teaches that these kinds of feelings are unnecessary etc etc
The next day he became a Jewish(!) agent in these kinds of circles
Just like Pope Francis later
Man, I wish I had so easy answers to every difficult question
I can’t believe he was skimping out on me
This is the best part
Yeah, the chakra is located near Pomáz, Pest county
Everyone here knows that
Jesus was also Hungarian as her mother is a princess from Adiabene, which is Sumerian and we have thousands of common words with Sumerian, and probably Sumerian derived from ancient Hungarian
Note: please don't fact check this as the Freemasons rewrote the history books so that nobody would find out the truth
I don’t think he said this one
I remember him saying Adam and Eve were definitely Hungarian and that the bible was mostly about Hungarians as well
So I guess he implied that Jesus was Hungarian
There are people (I met a couple of them) who actually belive that stuff
Their fandom is actually pretty big, and it's fun and terrifying in the same time to read about it
This is why we're so durable
The Black Sea was created by hungarians, and the Bible is just free-masonry propaganda created in the 19th century
I mean, obviusly
We are "joking" about reconquering translyvania, and sometimes slovakia
Of course
Hungary was cut down to like a third of it's original size in the Trianon peace treaty in 1920 (i velieve, not 100% sure its called that)
Well, Yes
Very much Yes
About any neighbour really
There isn't a Day where I don't here az least once that "Erdély(Transylvania) will be ours again" or "It's about time to reclaim the Felvidék (old name for Slovakia)". Some take this more seriously than others tho
Uhm, well I guess you could say that
One of my high school friends, was and is, a proper history buff, and in the first year of high school he showed me his plans for reconquering Transylvania, which he made in 7th or 8th grade
I don't remember his plans exactly any more, but I think they work
Surprisingly
In Hungary we only joke about the reconquer of:
Transylvania
Transcharpatia
Slovakia
Slavonia
Dalmatia
Croatia
Vojvodina
Banat
Partium
Burgenland
Muravidék
Rijeka
Dude, everyone knows Slovakia is not real, how could such a silly country be real, please
[Greatest Hungary] when
Can you please leave the Buda Castle alone this time
When did he said that sir
Wait till you hear some people even believe the Balaton to be real
Oh yeah sorry, i had a bad dream last night
Felvidék is REAL
Yeees
Viribus Unitis
Wow, some people are really naive I guess
Lmao hes just being an ass
Everytime he posts sth(literally from a nokia) there is always a map of the Hungarian kingdom
The neighbouring states take it seriously but noone really cares
The only reason I knew about it, its because I have a Belarus co-worker, and she wasnt able to connect to the meetings because of the situation
(They have some sort of internet outage
It is covered very well, like every news portal is posting some new articles about it (like about the riots, Putin congratulating, Germany suspecting etc) again and again
But I think there's not much interest in the topic in Hungary - the majority who like the reign of Orbán wouldn't support the wish and strife for democracy, and the rest of us are apathetic and hopeless, we know that these small protests and "riotettes" are useless against a dictatorship
A dictator will stay dictator until something global happens which turns the tables
The little to no consideration towards others in the name of protecting their personal freedoms
Like how it’s more important to some of them to own a gun than to stop school shootings or now with this idiotic corona protests to get a hair cut than to save others and their own life
Also the general attitud towards any kind of social help from the government
Capitalism (which seems almost worshipped by some people over there) is not gonna fall apart, just because you can get proper tretment for your illness without going bankrupt
And another thing which I really don’t understand: Are those gun nuts really think they could resist the US government, if it wanted to hurt/subjugate them
The US has the strongest military in the world, having 5 guns at home wouldn’t stop them
What i didn't seen mention before is the general friendliness towards strangers
Smiling at people on the street and going into small talk, it's nice but I can't help but feel wierd like "What do they want from me
The same is true for other countries and it's not unheard that the military did the bidding of the government and moved against the citizens who just wanted to protect their rights/freedoms or wanted a better life and protested for it
Also I don't think I have to explain to you how big the US is, it's not likely that the soldiers would have to kill their own neighbours or family, killing strangers is way easier
Is it really matters if it's an Iraqi teen or an American one, if the government says they are the bad guys
All in all, I just really don't see a situation where those guns could actually help you protect your freedoms and this argument for no gun control laws feels like some people not wanting to confront the hard truth and living in a fairy tale
I've seen pictures from Walmarts, which as far as I know is a supermarket where you can buy food and things like that, selling guns, so I don't know, if I believe in the "aren’t necessarily easy to get here" thing
I'm not saying ban all the guns, if you feel better, because you have a safely locked away gun in your drawer or you hunt as a sport, that's fine, but from the outside it really seems like the US government is not doing enough to prevent kids dying in their school and it's just chilling to me how people would rather have 20 guns than protect their children from dying in the middle of Math class
Anytime the mildest idea for a gun reform comes up, some people pretend it would be the end of freedom and democracy in the US, if they would have to go through some mental check ups or something like that before they buy a gun, my comment was refering to those people
It feels like wishful thinking
I imagine it's even worse, we are at least very social with people we know
>most people find Americans refreshing
Yeah I feel the same, but when you are walking in the street and the stranger smiles at you it feels wierd
You have to understand how ridiculous it sounds for non Americans that you can go into a supermarket and between the dairy products and the baby wipes you can choose a weapon that could kill a bunch of people
And again, I have no problem with people having guns, my comment was about those gun nuts who start shrieking everytime someone brings up that the US needs stricter gun laws
Wow, that's great
But honestly it would feel wierd to me
*even the norhterns are more extroverted then us ffs* /s
Ahh yeah, our only relatives
Depression
Lack of Vitamin D can lead to depression and suicidal thought
As we know, the Sun is a great source of Vitamin D. Scandinavia isn't the sunniest of places
Balatonfüred or Tihany
Lake Balaton is absolutely breathtaking
Hollokő, its a traditional town, where no buliding is older then 1920
I think Pécs is the "unknown treasure" city of Hungary
I would say Sopron (totally not biased because I live there) and Kőszeg for sure
Both are less-known towns near the Austrian border with a rich mixed German-Hungarian history and architecture
Kőszeg's old town is well-preserved and absolutely beautiful, and the nearby nature and hills also deserve a mention, it's worth a day-trip around it
Sopron is more known among Austrian tourists who come here mainly for the cheap dental and other services offered here, but it's not so commonplace to visit the old town, despite it's beauty
Sopron has quite the history and it's also called the most loyal town due to it's loyalty to Hungary which was shown in several occasions
It has a nice mix of Gothic, Baroque, and Austro-Hungarian architecture
Close to the city lies the castle known as the "Hungarian Versailles" in Fertőd which is also worth a visit
Vienna is only about an hour away, also close to Bratislava, and Lake Fertő/Neusiedl
I visited Potsdam last year and it was absolutely beautiful
Loved that city
Cor magis tibi Sena pandit
I haven't been to Italy sadly, but the cities Siena, Perugia, Gubbio, Foligno and Umbria itself are very well known for Hungarian readers, because a part of the novel _Journey by Moonlight_ by Antal Szerb is set there
(it's one of the more known Hungarian novels abroad, too)
Both of those are extremely popular though, when I went there it was filled with tourists to the core
the hungarian word for "kiss" (without tongue kiss) is "puszi"
its pronounciation is close to the English "pussy"
cringey and creepy pickup line idea: "hey girl can i give a puszi on your pussy
“Buzi” in Hungarian is kind of an offensive word used for gay people
“Buzi” in Hungarian is a derogatory term for gay men
Since we don't have another country with our alien language I would be more interested to hear about the Hungarian minorities' experience  from neighboring countries (Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, etc
> When growing up, I mostly watched Hungarian TV, but now I prefer Slovak channels (since our news are let's say
not censored)
Completely understandable, our news channels' content is literally North Korea-like propaganda meme material
>Yeah, and I was apparently brainwashed by leftist media and my  university
Fun times
I can relate to this more than I want to, welcome to the club
I have been politically brainwashed by a Computer Science degree and the Internet ruined my "national feeling". Apparently my grandparents left the Orbán train a few years ago, so it is better now, but the rising of irrationality is worrying
Ireland, especially the countryside
Well, English wouldn't be a problem, but I would love to know Irish
Iceland
I love the cold and I just want to fish while I grow old
Probably Finland
Finland for sure
Free wifi, better school system and I could go on
Happened to my aunt and cousin
My aunt, who doesn't really speak any language besides Hungarian, took her sons on a vacation to Turkey
At some point they went to the market and my aunt told my cousin to haggle for a rug since he spoke English, and instructed him what the max amount they are willing to pay should be
So my cousin starts haggling and the Turkish guy just says in perfect Hungarian: No no, your mother said she will pay [insert max amount here] for it so that's how much it is
They bought the rug
This is the first time a heard of it really, french deck is well-known and we have Hungarian deck (magyar kártya)
We use the Hungarian deck, wich is almost the same but with different symbols
The design was made in Budapest in the 1830s based on earlier German-style decks
According to the popular story the figures from the Wilhelm Tell story was a protest against the Habsburg rule
The rotational symmetry of the cards was that made it so popular in the region according to the wiki article
Can confirm, we call it magyar kártya
Yes, absolutely
I think that would be beneficial in every country
15-20 chilly (depends on how warm it was before), below 10 cold
* Above 22°C - short-sleeved T-shirt
* 15°C-22°C - pullover
* 5°C-15°C - thin jacket
* Below 5°C - winter jacket
18°C to 13°C: A cardigan will do fine
12°C to 7°C: A jacket on the thinner side will suffice
6°C to -4°C: I need a warm jacket
-5°C and below: I *need* my **warmest** jacket
Depends on what I call the seasonal cycle
for some reason autumn 18 C is warmer than Spring 18 C...
Cold Starts at:
June-November: Below 16 C
December-May: Below 20 C
For you
I would say that
25°C or more is time to be near some lake or pool to take a swim, 15-25°C is short sleeves an sandals, 15-5° time to take some light boots, long sleeved shirt & pants, maybe a hoodie
I will bring a light jacket from there up until -5°C. And below that its finally a proper winter, with a real winter jacket, where i start taking layers of clothes as appropriate
...ofc
i may not be representative of most people around here as i get the looks time to time,..
From the other end, it looks just as strange
Getting heavy physical dork done above 15°C is just a hot mess, i dont really get tired as much as too warm, like when you got a slight fever
I would say 5-10°C is ideal for physical labor
Some of myextended family grows pine for chriszmas trees and somtime i help them out
Frankly that temperature is the best for physical work, its stops being nippy, and gets very refreshing, and youdont warm up so much that you get "dulled" by it
There are no dark long winters
Here in my country we only had 2 days of snow in the whole 3 months
TWO DAYS
It was usually 5-10 celsius, rarely going into minus
Dude if you struggiling, just think about the guys up north, they need some respect
In Hungarian we use 'tökös' (has balls) which is an adjective and means that the person is brave or the person has pumkins somewhere on their body but I think the second option has never been used
Ever
Maybe in a context where someone was eating pumkins though
We also have 'töketlen'(has no balls)
It could mean that the person is clumsy, hesitant or a coward
Another expression with balls:
'Tele a töke' it means that 'their balls are full w sth
It's used to express that you've had enough of something, you're fed up
In Hungarian it means that you got kicked in the balls
And it happens
On national level, lesser evil only
On local level, we occasionally have independent candidates or candidates of local organizations I do believe in
Not in the "attend rallies and wave the flag" way but I do think they are fit to lead the place where I live
Lots of people smoke here, it's even popular among the teenagers
Although teens are more and more shifting towards the usage of vapes, juuls and iqos(-es
It is surely declining though, as in the socialist era almost EVERYONE smoked
In Hungary, smoking is so popular that the government nationalised the sale of tobacco
Now they can score big an a social problem
Not yet
You can actually buy Snus in Hungary now lol
In National Tobacco Shops
If I were you, I wouldn't try Siberia snus at first, try with something weak
The nicotine shock can even be brutal for regular smokers
My first snus contained like 43mg of Nicotine
I have never felt so bad from nicotine as  on that day
(I wasn't a smoker at the time though)
Yeah, they contain so much nicotine, it is no surprise they threw up
I tried that Siberia snus while having a gap lesson for school
I had it in for like 30 minutes, and then asked my friend, for how long I should keep it in
Imagine my face when he responded with "for first timers I wouldn't recommend more than maximum 5 minutes" haha
Yeah
now imagine some of those snus products contain more nicotine than a packet of cigarettes combined IN JUST ONE PIECE
If you ever try it, be careful, or you are gonna hate yourself haha
That's interesting
How is your Hungarian
Did you lean it
Are you planning to
Do you find it difficult
When in Hungary (or any place where a Hungarian might see/hear it) don't you dare make the hungry joke, or you'll lose all respect from Hungarians
Everyone of us has heard it a shitton of times, and no, it's still not funny
(Never has been)
Definietly these:
Slavs: NO
We are calling poles brothers for a differwnt reason
Easter European: NO
It's Central Europe, we even use CET
Hungry: it's something you pull the knife out, doesn't matter the place, time
Interesting
When you call a Hungarian Nazi a Nazi, those cowards always reject that "we're not nazis we're just national radicals".
There are people who say that
Look me in the eye brother
The official name of the NL in Hungarian is Hollandia, and we call your language and countrymen 'holland'
So, sad times here, sorry
Must be hard living in austria with all those kangaroos jumping around
Same here, we are CE bros
I think it's the most unfunniest because we are actually magyars and not Hungarians
:D only English is weird
Sorry serbian police here i have an arrest warrant
A much worse misspelling when ignorant Americans write Wiener as "Weiner". "Oh we don't have diphthongs, why the fuck should we care about other languages
I always weine when I see that
Just no
Germany isn't the Holy Roman Empire either
it's eastern only if you consider the Iron Wall as the delimiter bw East and West
however, if you look at it geographically, and just search it up on wiki, in almost each measures the countries in those area as central European
I'm glad you like it
I think that the hungry joke to us feels like, how calling the NL 'Holland' feels like to non-Hollander Dutchies
Horní Uhry
Dont you love hungary
Do you reject big hungary
Go back to romania you anti nationalist spy
how about the closeness to Hungary
how close do Austrians see us
The "Spanish peninsula" is called the Iberian peninsula, and Finland is not part of the Scandinavian peninsula
1920 Hungary (colorized)
but that assumes no Central Europe at all
I realized what it was called after I wrote my comment btw
The UN is like one of the most useless things on Earth
Classifying Sierra Leone as the "World's roundest country", while Africa is
Africa
Poland may be disputed, but the Czech Republic is as Central as it gets
The V4 countries are all Central
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but the NL's official Hungarian name is Hollandia
We don't really have the word "Netherlands". I guess Németalföld could go well, as historically it has been used, but that literally translates to "German Plain", so it doesn't really indicate that it's the Dutch we're talking about
Because that's the official name of the islands, unlike the peninsula, which most languages call the Iberian peninsula, or e.g. my language calls the Pirenees peninsula
> Honestly I don't see why being called England winds you lads up so much, it's only a name
I mean calling the Welsh English, is just as stupid as calling any non-English nation/country English
There are some group terms, like Scandinavia, which includes Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the Baltics, which includes Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Iberia, which includes Spain, Portugal and Andorra, and the British Isles, which include England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland
While alacsony ország does translate to low country, please trust me on this one, it sounds *ridiculous*, and in no way does it give us any clue that we are talking about the NL
I mean we have the word mélyföld, which literally translates to deep land
And we have the geographical name "Holland Mélyföld", which is a collective name for all the land in the Netherlands that lies below sea level
So not all the plains, only the ones below sea level
Our leaders know no limits
That the country I was born in is populated by pathetic morons who don't even realise that they are ruled by a megalomaniac psychopath which is a fucking burning shame
But their IQ level is not higher than their ego and expectations or their 2/3, aka 49%
Stop, I can only get so erect
I don't think I ever visited a country where half the women were topless on a normal public beach
In Hungary I'd say it's 10% at most
I think in Hungary the maximum was like 5% or less when it was fashionable, like from the late 80s to the very early 2000s. Nowadays it's virtually unknown, very few women sunbathe topless at lake Balaton
I literally have seen 0 topless women in my entire life, so I think even 10% is too much
It's the same here
The average salary was ~1000 € before taxes and a bigger box of Lego costs 100 €.
That said, most of my friends keep buying Legos for their kids as long as they can
When the kids become interested in PC or console gaming, that's when the nightmares start
Damn
That's kinda sad
Yes but it's a little complicated
It's kind of possible that your overtime only gets paid after three years, in specific circumstances
No habla Viking
Shakespeare and Chaucer are totally fine, Beowulf is 40%, and it helps that I know the text
I had no idea about the fourth one
Milton is a lot worse than Shakespeare though
We have three national holidays, two of which remember lost revolutions and independence wars (against Austria and the Soviet Union)
The third one is Foundation Day, the feast day of our first king, Saint Stephen
We also have the Day of National Unity on 4 June, the date when Hungary lost 2/3 of its historical territory and 1/3 of its ethnic Hungarian population
(Not a proper national holiday, but more of a remembrance day
When your country was occupied by foreign powers for half of its written history, there isn't really much reason to celebrate
[Ildikó Vida] Former head of Tax and Customs Office, she wanted to ambush the American ambassador with a question (with the help of some news reporters) about why she was banned from entering the United States
Only problem - she speaks no English, and forgets that she needs a translator
"No migrants more in
So stop them
Those who are in should bring back
So that's what the people will
" --- by our PM [Viktor Orbán]
My favorite is 'I am the people' by this self-proclaimed journalist
This one by Orbán was remixed about a million times, not too bad English but still quite bad and hilarious
Can we talk about the fact that a language certificate is required to get your high school diploma, yet politicians doesn't speak English
I think at least a 6
5 English and French should be the requirement to even be eligible
>I think at least a 6
5 English and French should be the requirement to even be eligible
Not necessarily French, but it would be preferable to have politicians who speak at least 2 EU languages
Imposing rules like that would be quite undemocratic, it's in our hands as electors to choose qualified people
French is the official NATO language and one of the EU commission languages
Just to name a few where it's useful for a politician to know these
Also imo setting basic requirements is not undemocratic, it's a necessity, a proof that you're capable of your job
Just like how a doctor needs a medical degree
Apart from supporting Germany in the Holocaust, i think the hungarians always opressed slavs when they had the opportunity to do it
I always taught the kidnapping the children and distributing them among loyal families in the Franco era is more famous
I've never heard of this island incident
The first one wasn't just about the Germans
It's pretty sad that the Beneš Decrees are still in effect
We actively participated in the Holocaust and still hasn't owned up to it
(In fact we've been getting worse at it lately, in the previous few years we've erected a statue commemorating Hungary's German occupation that depicts Hungary as completely innocent and blames everything on the Germans, and a government-aligned historical research organization called the deportation of some 10000 Jews at one point during the war a "border security operation".) Also at the same time we depopulated (read: massacred in cold blood) whole Slovak, Romanian and Ukrainian villages on the [Trianon territories] we reannexed into Hungary
It was pure vengeance, and thoroughly awful
EDIT: it should be noted that the population was just as enthusiastic about the Holocaust as the authorities
If the "blame it all on the Germans" tactic fails, it's common to leap to "blame it all on the gendarmerie". (Hungary had a separate gendarmerie at the time, it doesn't anymore
) In truth it was common for people to ransack the houses of their deported Jewish neighbors clean, sometimes before they were even put on the trains
When the few survivors returned they were often treated either with extreme hostility, in the "you were supposed to die, why didn't you fucking die" way
It was also common for people to feign shock at what happened to those Jews and then say their belongings got "misplaced" or "stolen" in the war - even though they were actually the ones who took it
the holocaust
The communist regime 1946-1953
The guy who leaded this wanted to copy Stalin's realm
> assuming you give us a pass for the nazi gold
hmmmm
watching it certainly doesnt hurt anyone, production does
Asereje was traumatizing, too
Adolf fucking Eichmann, of all people, testified in Nürnberg that several of his colleagues were shaken by the enthusiastic cooperation and the inhumanity of Hungarian authorities
Imagine that: Nazis find you too inhuman
*Top 10 pranks that went way too far*
Hmmm *looks at German killings/deportations looks at Hungarian killimgs/deportations* Hmmmmmmmm
Jesus, I didn't hear about that one at all
But here's another one: the [first anti-Jewish law] in Europe in the leadup to WW2 was ratified in Hungary, in 1920, 13 years before the Nazis even rose to power
Well I'll admit that this wasn't even close to being the most fucked-up thing to appear on the BBC
The children's shows of the last few decades lost a lot of their nostalgic value in recent years
Sure, but i doubt that anyone producing it can make a profit out of it even then
What I meant was don't act like the worst thing Czechia ever did was as innocent as trusting your own allies
Which is exactly why it would be insane to nuke you
Nuclear fallout does not respect borders
That was when producing it was legal
Clearly but we can't blame you: sticking it to the Brits must have been way too tempting
Doesn't 'Piątek wieczór' mean Friday night
Welcome from Hungary
Of course we have all the year cycle celebrations, but two old remnants which got associated with them:
- At Easter boys douse girls with a lot of water
Ancient magic to make the ladies make lot of children
By now it got corrupted and in practice means that the men of the family visit their extended family, the children get money the grownups get pálinka
The season of drunk driving accidents, the police usually has special actions to stop them
- New Bread
This is at the end of the summer, with harvest done, was a full on food sacrifice for the Gods, later to God, even later to the People Of The Hundarian People's Democratic
This old pagan tradition was called "Holiday of the Constitution and the New Bread" and was held on the 20th of August, in place of the old and current Saint Stephen (official founder of the Hungarian Kingdom)
[here is a communist truck float about an old pagan food sacrifice]
In Hungary some people dress in Busó costume in late february to chase away the winter
In Hungary it's mostly traditional in Mohács
This tradition has been practiced since the 15th century
• Throwing lentins at each other on New Years Eve (idk anyone who does this)
• On Easter Monday, we splash women with water and we get chocolate/pálinka (depending on age obviously)
• August 20, probably Hungary's most important holiday, we celebrate Saint Stephen I, the founder of the Kingdom of Hungary and the first Hungarian king
We shoot fireworks from the Danube on this day
We have something familiar in Hungary
The hungarian tradition for Luca day is to build a stool in a specific manner in the days preceeding it and if it's done correctly one can stand upon the stool on the 13th of december and see the witches
I know about this but never seen anyone doing it recently
Do we
I never knew about it lol
> unearthing the dead after 7 years to check if they are still dead
Why
Not that I know of
There is a split between Hungarians regarding our origins
1) The Finno-Ugric Theory
This is mainly based on the languages
Possible cognates, grammatical structures of the languages and so on
There are lots of similar basic (!!!) words and grammatical features (most relevant: no grammatical gender and the abundance of cases)
2) Turanism
This is the belief that we are actually related to the Turks, and the -stan countries and that we are actually huns
The whole shabang
This was started as a counter movement to the surrounding pan-germanism and pan-slavism in the 18-19th century
Turanists will tell you that the Finno-Ugric Theory was a propaganda and lie started by the Habsurgs, to rid us of our true origins and deprive our national pride
But here's the plot-twist: Turanism was actually started by a Finn nationalist, but now Finns are getting left out of the Turanist ideologies
Turanists have a bigger tendency to be far-right, and I've even seen someone say that "When I look in the mirror I see a Mongol not a European" which is obviously an exaggeration, because if modern day Hungarians took DNA tests, there would be lots of Slavic genes, due to the fact that we have been sandeiched between Slavs since the beginning of our European history
(This is coming from a Hungarian with blue eyes and blonde hair)
Regardless, of how persuasively someone might try to push their opinion, currently no one knows 100% what our origins are, but there are DNA tests being done on the Hungarian kings of the Árpád-dynasty, so we might have an answer in the near future
Yeah during ,,halotti-tor” we serve the deceased  food which can’t be touched
>strigoi
I should not have googled that shit wtf
Víz - vesi
Kéz - käsi
Vér - veri
These are also good
>moroi
Is that even worse than the strigoi
Them Romanians and their mythology
Does your mythology entirely consist of things coming out of graves
>ogres
Shrek is Romanian
Well most of our folktales are about sex, the others are about killing your siblings to succeed in life, or your siblings killing your animals so yeah
I think I see what you mean
YT channel: Hungarian Folk Tales
Basically, these are the tales I grew up watching on the TV
Watching them now hits completely differently then watching it as a child
I never knew they aired those in Romania as well
A Hungarian who is not bebaszva, mint az albán szamár
A Hungarian that pays taxes
A Hungarian who doesn't like goulash or any other national Hungarian food
A Hungarian who doesn't like paprika
Ohh yes, dear Hungary where nobody is alcoholic just "heavy drinker"
Hungary has a favorite toxicologist
Drunk as an Albanian donkey
He is a hungaricum
We don’t have genders so it’s just goes by “a hold” (the moon), “a nap” (the sun) or “nap” and “hold” simply
In poems though usually the moon is feminine, accompanied with adjectives relating to beauty, while the sun is more of a protective male (father even) figure, if you will
We dont have genders in our language
A nap - The Sun
A hold - The moon
Hungarian doesn't have gender differences in words we just say „a” or „az" depending on the first letter of the following word
None
In Hungarian, only people and animals have gramatic gender
All non-living things are genderless
Though in some folktale the Sun is addressed as male, and the Moon as female
Finno-ugric gang unite
I am not an expert on this field, but could you please give some examples of poems
I can not really recall anything like that
Hold, Nap, Föld
Celestial bodies are tulajdonnév.
That's funny af
Hungarian has no genders at all and the Parliament has just changed the law making transgender people impossible to change birth gender
If I had money you’d get a gold for this one
I’m also very far from an expert, just shared what I recalled from my studies / my impressions
Though here’s an example:
Tompa Mihály
A holdhoz
Hő vágyaim csak érted égnek,
Oh csendes éjek asszonya
Ha nem piroslik már az égnek
Felhőin a nap alkonya
"A Hold, ez ájult légi hölgy / csókolja a vad néger éjszakát"
Mondjuk ez nem "igazi" vers, csak az Esti Kornélban írja az egyik szereplő. Persze Kosztolányiból kinézem, hogy megírta az egész verset is, hogy aztán csak két sort használjon belőle a novellában
I stand corrected (even if I couldn’t care less about the spelling - sorry :D)
Yes, nap also means day and the t is usually an indication of the accusative tense, so this why it translates to good day :)
Erklärt es mir bitte (deutsch ist mein dritte sprache)
It's up to you, but why do you reply to a language question then

TIL
The golden ages of Hungary considered to be:
My personal favourite
14th and early 15th century the age of the Anjou Kings and Sigismund
The first Anjou king was a great diplomat, made treaties with Poland and Bohemia
During his reign begun the extraction of gold, silver and salt in Hungary
Hungary was the top silver producer for a long time
His son Luise the Great vassalized Moldova and Wallachia, counqered Dalmatia and had a Personal Union with Poland
He almost made a friendly kingdom in Southern Italy but his brother was killed
Sigismund of Luxemburg was Holy Roman Emperror and King of Bohemia too
Matthias I, the renesaince-humanist king of Hungary
Counqered Silesia, Moravia and Vienna
He made a peace treaty with the Ottomans what kept them at bay, and focused on western counqest
Reformed the tax system, and had a general who never lost a battle
He died without a son as most of our better kings, so his reforms didn't had lasting impact, but renesaince culture was thriving in Hungary until 1526
1867-1914
The "happy peacetimes". Hungary was a lesser, but almost equal part of a modern great power and the second industrial revolution was thriving
There were problems for sure (magyarisation, social inequality), but Hungary evolved with the world and wasn't  behind a 100 years
The first time is my favourite, because it was a true golden age with lasting impact, the other two were more like the last great times before our two greatest national catastrophes: the Battle of Mohács (1526), and the Treaty of Trianon (1920)
Edit: grammar
I think the 2 best periods in Hungary's history was
The reign of Mathias Rex
Austria-Hungary
Yes the happy peaceful times, from 1867 The Conciliation till 1914 basically the beginning of the first  world war
Exactly
Spoke from my mind
I appreciate this comment as it acknowledges the issues and oppression we did as a nation, but at the same time these were indeed the golden ages for us
What a shame we went down on the road we know now
Edit: I mean the nationalistic propagandist asshole of a nation we’ve grown into
I agree
But the dual monarchy is top1 on my list
>Everything up to Election Day 2016 seemed pretty golden
Well then your history eduaction was a complete success with its goal
It managed to raise a patritic man, who only sees glory
I would not say that periods like the coal wars, where local militias, federal personel & de fact mercanary companies massacred miners and their FAMILIES for striking, as something that can be part of a golden age
Or the US army bombing black protestors from planes when they demonstrated as part of a golden age
Similarly glorified robbing of technlogically inferior natives because "manifest destiny" & 'Murica fuck ~~yeah~~ you
is something that is disgusting for people in the civilized world
>Spoiler: real wages have not kept pace with cost of living, despite our national indexing system
...have you never seen a politician up close
Why the hell would you trust them to not alter data cosmetically to make themselves look better
It's always surprising to me, how relevant Báthory István was abroad
Neither Vladislaus I and Vladislaus II were headstrong
People say the first one often lost it
Stefan -> Estefan -> Estfan -> Estvan -> István.
I had only one really bad experience in Europe
We visited Romania with my family around 20 years ago in the summer
On the way home we had to wait for hours at the border
As we were moving slowly towards the border, we saw a minivan with and Italian licence plate on the side of the road and the driver was asking everyone for help
My mother speaks some Italian so we stopped and asked the guy what his problem was
As he began explaining, other people got out of his car and they mobbed us: began talking to everyone in my family in a mixture of Romanian, Hungarian, English and Italian, they were walking around our car, leaning in the rolled down windows, etc
We felt awkward but we (unfortunately) didn't tell them to go away
Eventually they went back to their minivan, my mom told us the guy needs something we can't help him with
On the other side of the border we realized that one of them stole my mother's wallet from the car
When I was in preschool we spent months in Greece every year
Our vacations were awesome but once when we came home the airport security stopped us
I was with my grandparents and my mom didn't give them a written document in which She agreed with the trip
Although I was young and picked up the language pretty well I barely understood anything
It was really confusing and scarry
In the end we could go home but I had to sit in the office of these airport officers and they tried to comfort me with toys and asked weird questions
I got a magnetic puzzle with cute fish drawins, I still keep it on my desk
I think I agree with you
I've been to Venice twice (Carnival and end of August) and it was, well, wouldn't say bad but not as enjoyable as it could've been
On the other hand, on my school trip we've been staying in a small town and did a trip around Lake Garda and people in the towns we stopped by were really friendly
I think the ice cream parlor in Malcesine even stayed open just for us, coming in at the last minutes
Or they were patient and waited for us to figure out the words/sentences we wanted to say in any of the smaller places, it was a fun trip
Luckily neither time we stayed in Venice; once in the small town with the school and spent our last afternoon/night in Venice before coming home and the other time in Mestre or Marghera
We used both times the old (mid80s) tour guide of my grandparents and went off the beaten path as much it's possible
Gondola rides are horribly expensive, other stuff I expected to be in the price range it was
Hot wasn't an issue for us
And the point of the school trip was to see the carnival (coincidentally we managed to catch the one in Verona, too) so it was unavoidable to have it packed with people
I even got a rose from a carnival-goer/cosplayer so it was worth in the end still
The gypsies stole the whole playground
In my home city Debrecen, a foreign student made a a song about [wheat grits] and it was a huge hit
Pretty much the whole country, except the capital, Budapest
That’s the only place where you would find tourists
Vigo was fun and cheap 20 years ago when I went by train
Then across the border to Porto
I bet you mean Ayers Rock (Uluru)
I would suggest Lake Balaton, it may be a little overcrowded during the summer tho
However I think around September it would be nice
Right now German, a decade or two from now, Polish
>Maybe we are not as poor and secluded as in the 90' and early 2000', but that doesn't mean we will suddenly be important enough in the EU
Not suddenly, but by 2050-2060
&#x200B;
>If we stay in the EU, of course, because half the voters don't care about the future of this country and it's citizens
I am pretty confident you will stay
Just like us
While anti-EU rethoric is great to gain votes from the conteo crowd, there are no benefits for people in power to leaving the EU
Thus representatives will continue their rethoric of "we must leave" to get votes and do nothing
And "half the voter" is alienated from politics, as the populist propaganda is very insulting to intellectuals
They do care, they just have no party they are willing to place confidence in
Yes, simply due to demographics
In a unified EU market, where there are no meaningful borders, its HIGHLY likely that a declining population of Germany - that has to support pensions - will lead to higher taxes
Lower population, means fewer workers on the job market, who - as a result - can demand higher wages
Poland simply lacks these issues
Regardless, until that problem arises - decades from even 2050-2060 - Poland will likely have the biggest economy in the EU
While i agree that nothing lasts forever - including economic might - Poland will likely have its own time in the spotlight
barring drastic unforseen changes like large wars, extreme pandemics, somebody conquering poland, humans transcending biological bodies ...etc
>there are around 39 million polish native speakers in the EU while there are 95 million EU citizens that grew up speaking German
There is nothing stopping people from learning polish
Like how nothing stops people from learning German
You are extremely removed from reality if you think that the majority of those 95 million are native speakers of German, and didn't learn the language out of economic necessity
And Germany has negative growth
Creating refugee camps - no matter how well intentioned - doesnt increase the workforce, when its surrounded by German burocracy
I agree that its a good cosmetic adjustemnt for demographic data
However people sitting for years in refugee camps are not exactly contributing much, regardless how (in)politically correct the fact are
It takes 4 years till legal restriction are removed
Even after that the way German dual training system works, won't make it easy to get a job
Basically all jobs require prior experience, which you get during un(der)paid internship
If you didn't go through said internship, for whatever reason, its a catch 22 situation, and you are basically fucked
Balkans is first and foremost balkans, small thing like religion take a backseat to stuff like extreme irrational hatred for all neighbouring coutries, consuming extreme amounts of alcohol and other balkans stuff
Thats cool as long as you dont have to work with foreign literature, then its an incredible pain in the butt
Ofc
its not THAT bad with planets, as there are not that many
Some madlad hungarians in created hungarian names for everything on the periodic table, thank god it didnt be ome widespread in use, like many other thing when this "create new words" was a fad
>People fry eggs with butter
This seems stupid but blew my mind, butter
Here we do It with olive oil
Here in Hungary, we use either lard or sunflower oil
>Most people know Pat & Mat
My childhood <3
I wanted to do that :(
And anime apparently
There are this scales about which country is doing what at different temperatures
My all-time favorite is "+5°C - Italian cars won't start". :D
It surfaces on meme sites like 9gag etc from time to time
If I find it, I'll post it
It's a hard question
Many are hated intensely by some, while others idolise them
Here are some examples:
**Saint Stephen, first King of Hungary:** He's respected by most as the founder of the country, but there's a small minority, who views him as a traitor to the nation's old paganic ways and as a dog of the Catholic Church and the Germans
**Andrew II:** He's not that controversial, I wouldn't say he's that hated either, although he certainly is heavily criticised
His reckless spending and overgenerous landgifts greatly reduced the royal authority and laid foundation for the later feudal anarchy
**Vladislaw I:** He's mostly hated for being such a huge moron, that he singlehandedly lost us one of the most important battles in our history, the Battle of Varna(1444)
When the Ottoman forces began to crumble, his overconfidence made him charge against the Sultan's guard, who surrounded and killed him
The Christian forces' morale plummeted and the battle was lost
**Louis II:** Generally viewed as a hedonistic good-for-nothing, who picked a fight with the Fuggers, when the country was in the direst need of money
He lost the Battle of Mohács against the Ottomans, and died while fleeing
Many others point out, that there was little he could do against the far stronger Ottomans, and he did what could be expected from him despite the ignorance and/or even antagonism of many barons of the country
**John Szapolyai/Zápolya:** He's definitely a controversial figure
He aspired for the throne ever since Louis II's father, Vladislaw II died
Based on that, many people think, that he purposely didn't participate in the Battle of Mohács, and let Louis II die, only to be able to seize the throne for himself
Well even if that's not true, when he lost the war for the throne against Ferdinand I of Habsburg, he pledged loyalty to the Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman I and became his vassal, who put him back on the throne of Hungary
This very soon led to the tripartition of Hungary, which led to many wars and the drastic depopulation of the country
There are many people though, who are not so keen of the Habsburgs
For them, John Szapolyai is seen as a heroic figure, who tried to fend of the rotten Germans while joining forces with another great Turanic nation such as us, the Turks
**Maria Theresia:** It is "common knowledge", that at the beginning of her reign, during the War of Austrian Succession, it was the Hungarian nobility, who saved her thrones for her
Despite this, she had the audacity to try to curtail the powers of the nobility and try to introduce changes in the name of Enlightement
Why do some people take it personally, that some nobles suddenly had a bit less say about political matters is beyond me
More sensible people respect her enlightened policies
There was really only one thing, which was actually really harmful for Hungary among her policies: Her tariff reform put up a barrier between Hungary and her Imperial holdings, which made the imports of crafted products into Hungary cheap, and the exports expensive
The opposite was done for agricultural products
Thus any possibility for the natural development of industry in Hungary was killed, and the social development of the country slowed down
**Joseph II:** He was an idealist, and a very forceful advocate of his own kind of Enlightement
He introduced German as official language in all of his empire, which directly sparked the national reawakening of Hungarians among others
In the end, he was forced to undo most of his very unpopular changes in the fear of a possible revolution
**Lajos Kossuth:** Many view him as a national hero, who led the Hungarian "Revolution and Freedom Fight of 1848-'49" against the vile Austrians, while others think of him as a complete moron, who:
\-Delegitimised the government, by seizing power with the OHB(Országos Honvédelmi Bizottság - National Home-Defence Committee)
\-Butted his head into military matters, which rarely helped
\-Gave Casus Belli to the Russians to intervene by dethroning the Habsburgs and declaring independence
**Francis Joseph:** Hated for crushing the revolution and for generally being a Habsburg, but he's also loved by many for the Compromise of 1867, and his long, peaceful rule until the Great War
Ah, yes, he's also strongly criticised for dragging the country into WW1
**Mihály Károlyi:** Nicknamed as the Red Count, he was a pacifist left-wing politician, who seized power after the Aster Revolution(1918
October 28-30
His and his government's pacifism and overobedience towards the victorious Entente and their allies made him a very hated figure, while the fact, that his political failings allowed the communists to take over is just like pouring oil on the fire
**Béla Kun:** Little is known about him personally by most people, but as the de facto leader of the communist Hungarian Council Republic, there's a strong hate against him
It is generally accepted, that the terms got much worse for Hungary later in the Treaty of Trianon because of the communist period of the country
**Miklós Horthy:** Very controversial figure
As Regent Hungary, he was a "strong man", an authoritarian figure, who contributted to freezing and even somewhat reversing the social development of the country in the Interwar years
He was also somewhat responsible for dragging Hungary into WW2, but given the circumstances, he had little choice
**Ferenc Szálasi:** A lunatic far-right traitor, who took over the country, when Horthy failed to withdraw it from the war
He was viewed as insane even by nazi standards and immensely contributed to the Holocaust and the destruction of Hungary in general
**Mátyás Rákosi:** "Stalin's best disciple", communist dictator of Hungary following the 1949 takeover
Hungary became one of the poorest country in Europe under him
The oppression and terror ultimately culminated in the Revolution of 1956
János Kádár probably qualifies
When you have to reinstall the security camera to stand furter from the grave because (some) people are still able to spit / take a piss ...etc
on it, thats probably a sign that you are a strong contender
(funny thing is that there are plenty of communist leaders who deserve the same treatment far more, but dont get it as he "reigned" the longest, and got stuck in the memory of the population
Hating on the ex-prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsány is a meme in itself since his resignation after his "we fucked up" speech (that got leaked), and the resulting mass unrest in the capital
Of course the current prime ministef Orbán also qualifies
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Some more historic examples would be Szilveszter Matuska, a mechanical engineer who had mass murder as a hobby, executed via derailing trains, with over a hundred vitims, between the 2 world wars
And Julius Jacob von Haynau also gives a run for his money - so to speak - due to his reprisals and his behaviour during the supression of zhe revolt of 45
There is a toast with beer "Bassza meg Hajnau" \~"Haynau can fuck himself" in reference to the supposed tradition of not drinking beer for a 100 years afted the defeat of 48 - only wine, palinka ...etc
Not the drink of those habsburg loving germans
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Imho
our first king should take the top spot, as - at least for me - mass murder, including ones one relatives, and erasing history by burning stuff qualifies
And doing so to converting at swordpoint is not defendable, even if you get to stick the St
prefix in ftont of your name for it
One would be Ferenc Szálasi, a fascist leader of Hungary during German occupation in WWII
He is responsible for the death of \~15000 jews if not more
He also sent kids and elderly people into hopeless battles against the Red Army
I can't comprehend how can anyone praise that moron
But really, why
What about Emperor Franz II->I? Or Conrad von Hötzendorf
As if he could've done much better
Poland's fate was already sealed, when the Prussians won the Seven Years' War
Do they care though
Yeah, I don't think so
Oh sorry, I misread your comment
So he's well regarded for his deeds, which he did within the territory of Belgium itself, but not what he did in Congo
Right
I teach Hungarian to foreigners
I have foreign friends who are very good at Hungarian
But none of them would pass as a native, not even after living in Hungary for several years
If you’re Slavic, your accent
in Hungarian will be much better than English speakers’ accent
Slavic speakers don’t have trouble with our consonants, only with the vowels
But the grammar is very hard with the ~18 “cases”, the many preverbs, definiteness/indefiniteness (foreigners just love to mess this one up), and then there’s the word order, which is not obvious and is very hard to master
Even if your pronunciation doesn’t give you away in the first minute of the conversation, and you even manage to use the correct form of every word, one tiny word order mistake and boom, it’s blatantly obvious to everybody that you’re most definitely not a goulash-gobbling lángos-loving paprikaphile
I would say it's almost impossible
Speaking fluent Hungarian as a foreigner with the same pronunciation and accent is a massive achievement
You can learn the grammar but I am yet to meet a foreigner who can properly pronounce "gy".
Probably impossible
Its really easy to recognize non native speakers
> I honestly have never even seen someone that didn’t live here from childhood that sounded even close to native
They always forget the potato, don't they
Actually, our pronunciation us kinda similar, but the grammar is different of course
Now I feel privileged
Are you agglutinating too
Sorry, this is the only thing I know/heard about the Danish language that stuck with me
Maybe you're right and it's really the only joke the other Scandies have
That's just tradition at this point
A lot of -stein names are now correctly pronounced as steen in American English
In the sense that this is the pronunciation you will find described in books, said by the most educated radio and TV hosts etc
It does differ from person to person though: Jeff Epstein is epsteen, but Bret and Eric Weinstein use stain
But anyway it would be shtain in German
Quick correction: The planet will survive, humanity won't. The planet endured far worse than us, but if we make this planet uninhabitable for ourselves than the people are fucked, not the planet
Otherwise, I completely agree with you
Poland and polish people for being absolute bros everytime I'm visiting
Thanks to the western european nato countries for helping Poland in the Poznan uprising in 1956
And thanks for the help in the hungarian revolt in 1956
And thanks for the help in the Prague spring in 1967
Thank you to Austria, for being the only country not to overstep the demarkation lines after WW1 and teying to annex more territory
And thanks to Poland for being the best brothers all throughout history
Iceland is like always the first to recognize everyone's independence
And Hungarian is left out lol
Nobody understands us .
Wish I could understand you guys
"Please" in English is also a shortened form of "if it please you", if I am not mistaken
If it grows too large, we'll make a new one with blackjack and hookers
I think most of us don't realise just how European we are until we step outside of Europe
Yes, I believe in the European identity
I don't think we'll ever become a state like the USA though
Our strength lies in our differences, our individuality, in spite of which we cooperate and work together to make all our nations better
We have disagreements and difficulties, but seeing things from so many angles has great value in my opinion
I'd say I am European first and Hungarian second, though I have difficulty imagining a situation where I would have to choose between the two
A common European identity certainly exists
However, there are also national, subnational and even lower-level identities (e.g. family)
Identities overlap
There have been numerous multiethnic empires in history
However, most of them crumbled in a few generations
While the nation state is a relatively new concept, it seems to be more stable than multiethnic states (e.g. France, Poland, Hungary existed for a pretty long time; the Soviet Union, the Roman Empire fell apart)
A "European Federation" seems no different - we can't build a European country on our love for pizza, schnitzel and fries alone, and constructing a shared identity, a common ground for hundreds of millions of people without a shared language, and with being raised wildly differently in each country is much more difficult than it seems
I consider myself primarily Hungarian, but I don't think that excludes having a European identity as well, in the same way that being a Hungarian doesn't exclude having a Budapest identity or a Catholic identity
I have been disappointed by my country and its people time and time again
If there is any "nationalism" I feel it's becouse I'm part of the EU
I'd love to believe that a European superstate is possible, however I think it is very unlikely, sinec nationalism is way too strong
I'd love the idea though
We would be much better defended from external and internal threats as well
I feel like that in Hungary and most of eastern europe as well, democracy is so new that people neither like it, nor responsible enough to aphold it
If the EU had the power to remove corrupted officials that were elected regionally it would be much appriciated
I just don't feel like we are mature enough as a nation to take care of ourselfes right now
Not yet at least
While I think it is kinda possible to maintain a multi-language state, I would rather like the official language to be English, or at least have it as something every citizen has to learn
It is already a great problem here, that only a few people knows english and they are very sheltered, since there is no real way for them to communicate with people outside their country or to get informed about the world
They mostly eat up some propaganda and be fine with it
They are totally disconnected from today's world, living in their national bubble
Without the people of Europe being able to learn about at least European matters, I don't think a centralised EU would last long
So yes, I absolutely believe in "European identity", I just think it is too early for it
We just need to get rid of nationalism, it hurt us too much in the last 100 years
I want to believe in a common European identity and in the European potential of (re)assuming the leading role in global matters
Half of my family lives in Belgium and i think the Manneken Pis (The peeing boy statue in Brussels) is really overrated, btw there is also a peeing girl statue wich not that many people know about
In Budapest the ruin bars
You pay a lot for drinking a shitty beer in a building too shitty to live in it
If you don’t speak Hunagrian they probably even scam you
In Hungary I would say Hévíz. Usually Russian eldery people visit it, it’s super expensive compared to other holiday villages (like Zalakaros or anywhere else) and has nothing to do except the thermal bath
Big European cities are overrated imo
I mean they are fun for a few day but i'd rather explore smaller, local sights
My favorite place in Berlin is the Potsdamer Platz
Knowing how it looked like before the war, how it looked like when the Wall was standing and how it looks today
I'm so glad they didn't try to recreate some fake old-fashioned buildings or such, but they erected skyscrapers like the building of the Deutsche Bahn
Another fun place is the Tempelhof airport, if you go inside from the S-Bahn station
Also, I love the name of the U-Bahn station Onkel Toms Hütte
I see you are a man of culture aswell
Romania
I personally don't hate Romania, but most of hungary hates romania, because they "stole" transylvania from us
Originally Austria or Turkey, but then *someone* took Transylvania
Romania
No hard feelings just casual hate
Our fellow Transylvania stealer eastern neighbours of course xd
Hümm
Nope
Nothing comes to mind
Definitely not anyone to the east
Nop
Well before ww1 the rivaly were Auatria and Turkey
After ww1 though
I just gotta say Romania
Even though it was over a hundred years ago that *that thing* happened
Some of our countrymen are still bitter about it
But there is no point in hating them
Its stupid
Damm like all of our neighbours
It used to be Austria, but now it's Romania
Romanians
Of course transylvanian people (basically also hungarians) on our side
Pretty much all of our neighbors
The bigger the border, the more we hate them
(Not me personally, just commenting on it
There are no rivals of the Great Starempire of Sirius
Exept maybe the Alliance of Reptilian Corporates
Romania
We hate them, for taking a big piece of our land
Interestingly, people seem to hate Romania the country, more than the Romanian people
Is it Turkey
Amen to that
Was looking for this comment
It's a thing in the past already, but truth be told, the Romanians of the time did play a bit dirty then and there
Wouldn’t be so sure about the no hard feelings part
Genius
Simply genius
oh my god I didn't even know they were both called Orban that is just amazing
Yea but remember what happend at Mohács in 1526
I don't have any problem with Romanians
I just hate on them by tradition
I haven’t even seen those two words in the same sentence ever
You see, Austria-Hungary wasn't exactly an actual country
Austria and Hungary were almost completely independent from each other aside from the shared army, foreign policy, these two's financing and ofcourse the shared ruler
This was technically true even before the Compromise of 1867 (with the exception of 1849–1860), but the absolutist nature of rule in Austria at the time made it difficult to distinguish between said country and the common ruler
Hence the false impression by many, that Hungary  was part of Austria
Anyway, in such circumstances of duality, the development of some sort of rivalry really isn't that surprising
No, that's a sporting event
I think you meant decathlon
Because reentering the war one day short of German surrender, violating the demarcation line and unilaterally declaring the annexation of part of a country really talks about chivalrous behaviour
> Part of a country that voted for uniting with Romania
Only the Romanians voted, since that was the assembly of the Romanians of Transylvania
The Hungarians of Transylvania declared loyalty to the government in Budapest, while the Transylvanian Saxons only declared for Romania in January, when the writing was already on the wall
&#x200B;
> majority is Romanian
Sure thing, the population of Romania was 51% Romanian, but those 34% Hungarians and 15% Saxons weren't really given a choice
&#x200B;
> oppressed for hundreds of years by their conquerors
Opressed for hundreds of years
Magyarisation was a shameful thing for sure, but such thing only began in the 1870s and was quite mild until the Lex Apponyi from 1907
Already by 1914, the Hungarian politicans were increasingly more open to address the grievances of the nationalities, and when in 1918 the Károlyi Government got to power, the nationalities were offered almost anything they wanted beside independence
Never heard of it, we mostly pass out hugging the toalette
Croatians, how bad was the earthquake in the morning
Surrounding countries, did you feel it, too
Are there damages
We send our sympathy
Apparently, people could feel it in the Southwestern part of Hungary
EDIT: Hopefully the injured (including the 15 yo girl) will perfectly recover
Wish them the best
This is the live seismogram registered in _Becsehely_, small village near to the Croatian border:  The spikes are very well visible
You could feel it on the northern beach of Balaton
My thoughts are with you Croatian and Slovenian sisters/brothers
Be strong, we are with you
I know it may not be the best time to joke, but
It's a Székely (secui) joke from after 1977
The Székely goes for a visit to Bucharest after the earthquake
When he returns to his village, his friends ask him:
"Did you see that plague of God
"Yes
And also his wife
Well it's not a good joke then if I have to explain
The friends meant the ruins caused by the earthquake; but he meant Ceauşescu and Elena as the plague of God
_The Székelys are a subgroup of the Hungarian people living mostly in the Székely Land in Romania
EDIT: there is a genre of jokes about them
Usually, they are portrayed as simple thinking but cunning people of the mountain
Home office on a slow day makes it fast
Btw, it's a pretty common surname, too
>London
I think this city underwhelmed me the most of any that I've ever been to
It's just
meh to me and I also found it quite ugly and not very nice on the eyes in relation to most of its architecture
Food is good though
I wouldn't say its "ugly" there are plenty worse
Its just not a particularly nice one in terms of architecture as far as cities in europe go
Or maybe i am a bit spoiled by Budapest, idk
What surprised me the most is the travesty of a public transportation they have
Like you hear that there are gazillion underground railway lines, rich country ...etc
you suspect something good, or at least better than in the balkans
Nope
Its small, cramped - compared to the lines around here - extremely, i mean EXTREMELY overcrowded
And the prices are absolutely ludicrous
Yes, people earn more
However a monthly travelcard (that as a ticket to every public transport for a month) is \~350£, here in budapest you get the same thing for \~30€. And minimum wage is 450€, while \~1500€ in the UK (so adjust cost of living accordingly), that 350 pound pass is damned as hell expensive
And its the worst for people who earn the least, as they are who need public transport the most - and ofc
its also good for companies, as it allows cheap labor to be able to get to the workplace
Yes
And its a bit sad, that too many of the asian population centers with extremely beautiful architecture got abandoned and destroyed
And its extreme shame what happend to tenochtitlan (current mexico city), as it used to be the Venice of americas rivaling the biggest cities in europe in terms of size, population & architecture
Well budapest is not "soulles commie architecture" by virtue of being simply to big to demolish and rebuild in the - at the trime trendy - so called "brutalist" architectural style
Most of those beuitiful bilding built (or renovated) in the classicist style were built at the end of 1800s &  early 1900, in a truely enormous area
Smaller cities in my country often got that tratment
Like the main street of my hometown (\~50
000) where all the nice buildings along the main street got either completely demolished, or all the decorative elements were removed
On the upside finally they are in the process of being slowly restored to their pre WWI era state
I think it is
“kurva” - in Hungarian and basically all the slavic languages
“curva” - in Italian, Spanish and Portugese
Polish and Hungarian
"Kurwa" in polish means a prostitute, while in hungarian, "kurva" is a synonym for your mother
I always find it amusing when I hear commentators during the Monza GP in Formula 1 talk about a particular corner on the track called the 'Curva Grande'
German "Sahne" apparently means "cream" while Turkish "sahne" is "stage" (like, a concert/theatre stage), imagine my amusement when reading "mit Sahne" on a dessert packaging (I don't speak German at all)
That sounds really similar to Hungarian _dinnye_ which is melon/watermelon (can be any kind of melon)
Ooooh pastel chalks
I loved those when I used to draw
I don't like Hungary, because the politics is pretty fucked up, but it is an Eastern European country, after all
The leaders do not spend money on what they should (for example iirc, there are 6 football pitches in Mezőkövesd, a town)
The opposers are really weak separately, and they do not want to co-operate for the most part, so to sum up, we have a "dead-end" type of politics
I would like to move to the Netherlands, because the people are really nice, the quality of life is much better and the whole country is gorgeous (the Hague amazed me the most)
So right now, I'm doing everything to get there, I study a lot to have good grades and I even study Dutch (but it's just Duolingo, so it's not that much)
Thank god I have an advantage because I'm only 13, so I have a lot of time to master my skills
No i hate it because of the government
I want to move to the UK in the future, if possible
I feel very uncomfortable in Hungary, so yeah, sooner or later I'd like to move out if I happen to survive my depression
I don't know which country would fit me best
Maybe I'll try several, then decide where to settle, I don't know
I like living here, but in the future i'd like to move out somewhere to experience other cultures
I hate most things about my country, and I am considering moving to the Netherlands
I do, however like the town I live in, and I love having lots of family nearby, so I'm quite torn on the issue
I like living in Budapest, but I very much want to live abroad as well
Due to work I have some friends from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and I really want to explore, to improve myself
I think it adds so much to one’s character and personality to live abroad and experience another area and culture
I studied in Turkey for a couple of months too and being a socially awkward mess I just ended up as the most lonely person possible
It was tough
People are friendly and VERY helpful though, indeed, I loved that
It's just that, I didn't make any friends - are foreign student group wasn't too big and with Turks I've always felt like an outsider/intruder
It was a weird experience
But hey, at least there were cats
Also, the weather pretty much cured my autumn/winter nose bleeding problem that I had at home
And of course, I still miss the food
And the kitties
And my uni
I agree with all you said about our politics
So many damage has done to this country, no idea how much time it would take to fix it
Hungary is beautiful, and its land is very fertile
However, being sandwiched between Austria, Germany, Russia and the Ottoman Empire has not made our lives easy
Also, our current borders have basically no defensible position if our neighbours would attack us, we have no mountain ranges on the border anymore
The Árpáds could have wandered a bit further west into Europe, we could have had a much lighter history (but not as heroic :-) )
>Doesn't snow that often during the summer
LMAO
》Imagine being one of the geographically most blessed countries in the world
》Imagine still complaining
》mfw
So it's like a French version of Northern Ireland
That's fair
No, it's a reference to my hometown Székesfehérvár, Fehérvár for short
The "-i" at the end means the same as "of" in English
Peter Fehervari's surname might be also related to this city
Some of his ancestors probably lived around here and/or possessed some estates in the area
Well, the most intricate one was from a humor magazine in the '90s called "Kretén", where there was a questionare what a young manager would say in the given situation to excuse herself
The direct quote was *"Kivonszolom a beleimet, és megkarcolom a fajanszot hogy megreped"* which can be translated as:
*"I shall now drag my guts out, and scrape the porcelain until it shatters
Meglátogatni szarkáékat - Visit the szarkas ( szarka being a bird, but szar meaning shit, and ka being something you put after names if the individual is either a child, or you think they are cute yadda yadda)
This is beautiful

Gee thanks, now I can never go to Darmstadt again, which is unfortunate because I visit there a lot
PLEASE don't ruin Essen as well
There was also:
\- **karimáig verem a révást** and
\- m**egyek a klotyira kicsi a rakást játszani,**
But one's almost impossible to translate properly, and the other's just "Going to the loo to play dogpile", which is not that extraordinary
Like in Űrgammák (other cultural milestone from the same period), "untranslatable drakvúf curse words".
Vielen Dank, dass du den Witz erklärt hast . :)
Wow, that show was BAD
Not in the cute, cheesy way like "Kölyökidő", but in a truly awful, "Szimat szörény" manner
I agree in the badness of Űrgammák, but Szimat Szörény was a different level
A crime against humanity

Awful
Back in the day lada was basically the only car here
And its still very popular
It's a little bit off topic, but I must post this:
This is a pretty old video of a Hungarian comedian whose main attraction was he could imitate the sound of various Eastern bloc cars and vehicles
Of course what he says in between is the funniest, but the sounds are cool, too
In order: Trabant (at the very beginning), Lada 1200 ("The Lada can consume fuel and oil in 1:1 rate" :D ), Barkas ("The fuel inlet is closed with a lock, who knows why"), a jet-ski, Wartburg ("The idling is special: there aren't two identical cycles" :DDD ), Rába truck (the best is the turbo and the handbrake at the end), Romet Pony (motorbike), Polski Fiat 126p (starts difficultly)
Yeah
They were really popular here up until the early 2000's. Even though they are quite rare now, I still see one once a week
When i say basically its because of course there was other brands but Lada was the most popular i think
How the eff is this so high
Of course it's not true
And why didn't you read the other comments
Trabant
Wartburg
Škoda
Dacia
Polski Fiat
Moskvich
Zastava
And you could buy Western cars, too (like Opel), it was just very expensive
What are you talking about
Lada was one of the medium priced and relatively bigger, relatively better cars from the variety, but it was far from being the only one
And it wasn't 1-2 years, but like 7
You seem very young
Trabants were popular too, and I saw a Moskvich too, idk how popular it was
Then you're very wrong
Reminder: Trabant, Wartburg, Škoda were also as very popular
Oh yea the good old *strandkorlát* blue Trabant
I thought I was straightforward agressive
:( :)
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa
I'm sickened
Marseille is an obstacle course
Honestly, that doesn't sound bad
I don't really see anything objectionable about it, even if the Italians might be horrified
Dwa bratanki or not you're on thin fucking ice bud

Orban is overweight and a manlet so I wouldn't bet on him
Orbán is not really fit, but he would fight dirty, so maybe
Also our head of state is János Áder, so it wouldn't be Orbán who fights in this
They don't have the same cultural connection to it we have so it's probably that
Asian religions are probably really weird for them as well when portrayed from a western angle
But that's just a theory
I don't feel 'not-hungarian' but i also don't feel 'hungarian' either if that makes sense
I don't like being or living in hungary and i wanna move (i've lived abroad before and i liked it much better than living at home) but i guess i could fit in if i wanted to
Given how quiet and polite I am, how much I respect rules, and my love for animation, I'm pretty sure I was meant to be born Japanese
The brooding, slightly alcoholic, hostile Hungarian culture feels so alien
I think the same
I've got relatives living in Germany, visited them many times, and oh boy, that's a lovely country
Why don't you move
Why do you think that
I'm just curious
I wasn't trying to imply that
I simply mean, that my personality and values appear to be more in line with what is the general idea there
Yes, the stereotype
I don't feel like I fit the Hungarian one, so I look for others that feel more relatable for me
Obviously not all Hungarians are all the same pessimistic alcoholics either, I am example of the contrary, why would I assume that all Japanese are like the stereotype
We can say that stereotypes are bad and shouldn't exist, but then we wouldn't have questions like this or the feeling that we are not like our countrymen
Look into the states first and don't just pursue the "American Dream". Also no need to go that far when EU is full with opportunities
You are still 18
Have you been to any other countries in the EU to have this argument
You probably need to figure out what do you want to do with your life
Don't rush it
I think in Hungary with one of the highest rate of serious alcoholics in Europe (some suggest we have got around 1M out of 10M), it's rather usual to see people, especially builders have an equal amount of three-four shots in the morning to get over withdrawal effects
So you can imagine that seeing one drinking for the sake of getting drunk is a usual sight, but not really taken as normal or accepted though
Lol here there are a shit ton of pubs
Basically every 10 person drank alcohol atleast once in their life
Fuck it every 5
For 6 people 4 or 5 wine bottles isn't even that much tbh
Make it everyone lol, besides some baptists I don't know anyone who didn't drink atleast once
> Milk in bags
I passionately hated that thing, because it was so easy to cut the bag unintentionally
There are park and even playgrounds in Hungary with those signs
I mean TF
Where should they play then
There are still a few one here, but not that common like 20 years ago
Closest I've seen in Hungary is a graffiti on a side of a building that just said "God loves you". That's it, never seen that on billboards
Those are (aside from the standard ads) for political propaganda
now that is usually there in droves
Not entirely sure, but we did have thinly veiled anti-semitic billboards everywhere when the government was doing its stop soros campaign
Never seen one around here
Also, billboards are being more and more regulated out of existence
I still find it so awesome, that there are people, who actually can understand other languages without learning it
As a Hungarian, I wish
we do have a few common words with Finnish but even those need quite a bit of mental gymnastics to even see/hear the similarities
A direct result of some 3000 years of separation from our Finnish brothers and sisters :(
There is not such a similar languange exist that we can understand by reading, our one is very different from others
I know the closest relative languange is mansy, there are some similar words and also things we can understand, but we cant figure out the whole sentence
Here is some example, for fun, and also to other hungarians who didnt know this languange is exist:
Mansi:Hurem-szát-husz hulach-szem ampem viten eli
Hungarian: Háromszázhúsz hollószemű ebem vízen él.
Edit: yeah this pharse is understandable but, this is chosen to be understandable, so its show the two languange is similar and close to each other
None, we also hate everything that's not in hungarian and refuse to learn other languages
Being fair we do have some common words, like fish (hal) but man, I can’t make out anyone of Finnish and I expect you the same with Hungarian
Also don't forget to mention that the two languages (Khanty, Mansi) supposedly closest to Hungarian are small languages in Russia with ~10k native speakers combined so it's not something you'd randomly come across and since we've been isolated for so long there's probably no mutual intelligibility at all even with them
I knew of Mansi but never seen or heard anything in it before
It's not a language you'd commonly come across lol
I wonder how much I'd understand of a longer text but
Probably not much
Hungarian, Estonian and Finnish are finno-ugric, back in the nomadic days we were in the Uralic mountains (the mountain that separates europe and asia) then slowly migrated to our current location,so you could say that Hungary took a wrong turn there
Yeah its not common at all, and unfortunatly there is only 900 native speakers left
There is a youtube chanel called "i love languanges"
They have a mansi video i think, maybe you can try it there
K assimilates to kh, and from there to h - as I said, needs a bit of mental and some linguistics gymnastics
Edit: I realise I said the mental and linguistic part in another comment, my mistake
Homemade alcohol
Everyone who owns a garden with fruits growing in it makes alcohol, be it wine, liquor or spirits basically every family prides themself on how good their wine or pálinka (spirit with 60+%) is, and tries to share it with anyone willing to drink
If you’re ever visiting Hungary, don’t turn down pálinka if offered, it’s our form of being hospitable to strangers
Same here in Hungary
No one makes better alcohol and sausages than Grandpa
An unexpected pálinka can hit harder than a truck
There is a hungarian song called „Pálinka dal“ which is solely about how much the guy loves pálinka, maybe you can relate to it
(Don’t know whether it has a translated version somewhere
We usually watch out for each other, so hospitalizations are rare, but it’s not uncommon to drink until you can’t walk straight anymore
Yeah
Thankfully that's not true
The people making the goods, usually seniors, watch out for people drinking it
Sure, they love to see them make funny expressions if they are not frequent drinkers, get a few laughs out of it
But letting someone drink themselves to a level where they just straight up collapse is insanely rare
The best wines are the ones without label here, winery has a long tradition in most families
Our family gathering revolve around a never ending circle of who’s homemade we try next, so i can’t complain
You can’t tax something, that doesn’t appear in the books, aka why eastern europe is constantly broke
I don’t know what poitín is, but it’s basically moonshine, just the local version
If you’re persistent on the fact you don’t drink in general, they let you off the hook, but they’ll still be a bit disappointed
Like when your friend wants to show you their new car, but you don’t care about cars, they’ll be a bit disappointed, but they’ll understand it
Not that i know of, but i live on the far western side of Hungary, so perhaps they are more prominent on the eastern side close to Romania
That might be true, but we tend to warn them about how strong it is, also unlike vodka, pálinka is usually only drank 2 or 3 times a night, even we don’t advise drinking more
Nah, all good mate, all good
Sounds like something i can start and end my day with at the same time
Can't say I heard of anything like that either
I live in South-East Hungary
In hungarian we call extremely strong alcohol „kerítés szaggató“, a fence ripper, and some only drink 85% pálinka, you could knock out a bear with that
Kürtőskalács
(chimney cake) u can get it for less than a euro (hands up nyugati 200ft Kürtőskalács) and
[lángos ] that's a must when you're visiting lake Balaton or the "waterpark".
I would rather say lángos
Displaying the flag is not uncommon
You can see a lot of houses with the flag
Not necessarily uncommon to have one (I have an EU and a Hungarian one in my flat on the walls)
I'm curious, is there an independence movement there akin to the one in Scotland
If so, how much support does it have
Where
I would say it's fairly rare
Not in Budapest, but in most other smaller towns you can't go more than a km without seeing one
Interesting
Then, if not else, it's not that common here in Fejér county, I would say
Yep
Thats true
Aside from official buildings, I don't recall seeing any here in northern Pest county either
Two pictures came to my mind:
[This] is the Chain Bridge blown up and the destroyed Buda Castle in the background in 1945,
[and this] is a photo taken at the Pan-European Picnic in 1989 when the border between Hungary and Austria was opened and many DDR citizens could get through and go to West Germany
We remember this moment as "when Hungary knocked the first brick out of the Berlin Wall
I was going to link this for Hungary, lol
Our teacher showed us this photo in history class when we were learning about the aftermath of ww2
It is certainly powerful
By a Hungarian photographer
The government's idea that "Women are vessels for the brave Hungarian men that they will birth
Have as many kids as possible, but 4 is the minimum
If you have 4 kids, the gods will grace you with a 3% tax reduction
Well, not like you'll see a workplace for 15 years if you have 4 kids, but who cares
Have as many children as possible in the worst conditions as possible so they will be as poor and as stupid and as gullible as you are
You're not a human, you're just a woman
In 1993 'Duck Tales' was interrupted to announce the death of Hungary's first freely elected prime minister
The experience had a huge impact on the kids who were watching it, some still find it haunting 20+ years later
Did something similar happen in your country
It happened in the evening, at the time only 2 tv channels existed here and millions of people were watching it
The show was interrupted right at the time when a cartoon duck was screaming at the top of his lungs 'A SEA MONSTER ATE MY ICE CREAM
' Then Chopin's Marche Funèbre started playing for a few minutes
Then there was the announcement, more music then the show continued
I wasn't even close to being alive at the time but as I watch it, it still has a very unsettling atmosphere
For many people who were young at the time this is the most vivid memory from those years, and this became a unique experience for an entire generation
If some of my info is incorrect, please correct me I'm not 100% sure I got everything right about this story
Did something similar happen in your country that had long lasting impact
Here's the clip for the folks who are interested:
EDIT: wow this happened more than I expected
I've heard about a TV channel hijacking in the USA, I don't remember what it's called, but it's creepy
Saw the Challenger explode on live TV when I was 6
Saw the  Ceaușescu execution when I was 9
...and yeah, I saw the aforementioned Duck Tales episode live too
I remember this
It made headlines in Hungary too, my cousins and I spent the evening at our grandparents' place, who happened to work with a Turkish company, we didn't care/understand much but I clearly remember some of the footage from the streets
Wow I didn't know about the Swan Lake thing, maybe it was only in the Slavic USSR countries, but I remember that one of the of the biggest newspapers at the time announced Stalin's death with a typo in the main title, which kinda changed the meaning
It was supposed to be 'We're profoundly shaken by the death of Stalin
' but because of the typo it's basically 'We're deeply ordered to announce Stalin's death
Yeah, the ÁVH(State Protection Authority) thought that too, so the editor disappeared for a few months after the incident
It definitely could be a mistake though, the two words have only one letter difference
(Megrendeléssel vs megrendüléssel)
Not at all
On the contrary, peace feels a little strange and precarious
My parents always expected another major war, so I grew up with that
There are reminders everywhere
Even in my 20s, there were still a lot of WWII survivors who openly talked about their experiences
That war still feels very relevant
Of course, there have been wars in Europe since then
At one point, they said you could feel the bombing in Serbia fairly far into southern Hungary, and we had a lot of refugees
And look at what Ukraine is dealing with (and Georgia and Armenia, if you count them as Europe, which I do)
We are fine, too broke to try to restore anything lol
One interesting one we have is the *aranykorona (golden crown)*, it measures the **[fertility of land] An average land (in Hungary) is 19 Ak/ha (golden crown per hectares), and it can be an important factor in the land value
The golden crown value of a land is part of the officially records, it goes back to the 1850's, it was originally used to determine the amount of taxes to be payed
Somehow the system remained in use to date
Whole different topic, but something that most people don't know about is that there is an imperial horsepower (hp) and a german Pferdestärke (PS or capital HP), that are very close, but not quite equal (100PS = 98
6hp)
We use the German in everyday speech when talking about cars (the records are in kW ofc)
The *köpés* or *parasztköpés* which means a spit or a peasant spit
It has no measurements it just says if somethings close or relatively close
Hectare is a very common thing that many countries use
I just looked it up:
Hectare is only used for measuring land area
Not like house or something, only land area
Yo, i dont know how to tell you, but ... umm choose something else instead of Notre Dame
Am i allowed to say drinking
Irish does sound cool
In retrospect, do you think it was okay to be punished for speaking English
Personally I find it a bit harsh, but it's not my place to judge
Well we have palinka too which is a little bit stronger but i rarely drink it
I have to say that i love homemade wine which my friend makes, im not an expert in wines but it definetly has better taste than some of the wines you buy at the store
Definetly wine
Not a restaurant chain, but I would really love some currywurst places around here
We had the Belgian _Quick_ for a couple of years in the early 2000s, but they moved out
I still miss their food, it was very tasty
BURGERISTA from Germany
Alone for their apple barbecue sauce
I'm drooling now
At least one thing we're more advanced in than Norway
Yaay
Until then we have to make do with homemade stuff, at least it's easy to prepare
My grandma uses freemail
So everything she says she sends it in freemail
Nope
In Hungarian we use e-mail or mail if it's important to emphasize in the conversation how they're going to get the message
If it's obvious that it's going to be an email we just say "I'll send it to you" instead of "I'll email it to you".
Not really, everybody says e-mail or levél (mail)
But lot of people use "PPT" (of course like it would be a Hungarian acronym "pépété") as a synonym of a presentation which is cringe
OMG hotmail
Kinda sad that it is dying
1, Austria
2, Poland
3, Turkey
4, Romania
5, Germany
I was struggling with adding Croatia, Serbia, CzechRep, Slovakia, but as the post says the "whole history", I went with the whole timeline, and in the scope of how I have learned about them
Hungarian history teaching is changing significantly from year to year under Fidesz rule
The quality is deteriorating and nationalistic theories are starting to appear on the pages of state mandated history books, thanks to our minister of human resources (who are currently trying to put our late king Matthias the Just's bones together, because he thinks it will help the fight against the pandemic) Because of this others perception about Hungarian history teaching would be different
Byzantine Empire / Roman Empire
England / Great Britain
France
Poland
Russia
Poland
We had many shared kings, and our rules often inter-married, plus the whole history-long alliance and always helping each other in battles and conflicts
Austria
Matthias I of Hungary has conquered Vienna, plus after 1526, 1 part of Hungary was under Habsburg rule, and after the Ottomans were expelled, the entirety of Hungary was incorporated into the Habsburg Empire, then after 1867, we had Austria-Hungary until WW1
And we were the first country to topple to Iron Curtain on our border with Austria
Turkey (Ottoman Empire)
We had very many conflicts throughout history, especially in the middle ages, when we suffered a devastating loss at Mohács in 1526, after which the Ottomans conquered Buda, and a third of Hungary was directly annexed by the Ottoman Empire, while East Hungary (aka
Transylvania) became an Ottoman vassal
Croatia
We were in a personal union for 818 years, until the Treaty of Trianon
And Croatia is the neighbour we had the least amount of historical conflicts with, except for the 1848 revolution, when they sided with the Habsburgs
Russia
Russia helped the Habsburgs defeat the 1848 revolution
Then in WW1, we fought against each other, then in WW2, Hungary suffered devastating losses again at the Don river, then we became a sattelite state, and the whole 1956 revolution happened
Honorable mentions:
Czech Republic
Our kings made an alliance at the Visegrád congress, which is the idea behind the modern day V4 alliance
Then after Trianon, we had quite a few conflicts with Czechoslovakia, then the Vienna Awards and the Beneš decrees
(I know that it mostly involves Slovakia's territory, but Slovakia has only become independent in 1993, while Czechia (Bohemia) has existed for a longer time)
And this Visegrád alliance can also be applied for Poland's part, since the Czech, the Polish and the Hungarian kings were there
Germany:
Our first king's wife was from Bavaria, then the whole alliance between Austria-Hungary & Germany, plus the world wars, and we also helped Ossis escape to the West after the Iron Curtain was dismantled between Austria and Hungary
Do you learn more about Austria than Hungary
What do you learn about Hungarian history
Do you only learn about the history in the North or about the wars and the Golden Bull too
I think putting croatia instead of romania would be more accurate
I don’t remember studying a lick of romanian history
We definietly learn more about the Ottomans than Poland
I wouldn't put Poland on the list
Edit: I have been proven wrong
I don't think this is right
No Russia on the list
I personally wouldn't put Romania on the list, since our history really only intertwines after Trianon
Do you learn more about us than Turkey and Russia
>(who are currently trying to put our late king Matthias the Just's bones together, because he thinks it will help the fight against the pandemic)
You have an interesting list, and I love your approach, but I believe Austria is a must on this list
I also can't wrap my head around Britain
>the uter hatred towards hungary is felt thru all of our history books, and our constitution
Franciaország is sokszor megjelenik
Régen külön leckék voltak a Napkirályról, Napóleonról és a Francia Forradalomról.
Azóta, azt hiszem, XIV
Lajos kikerült az anyagból.
Poland is certainly in the top 5, even if not 2nd place
We had shared rulers such as Louis the Great and Stephen Báthory, Hungary had a whole Polish-Lithuanian dynasty, shared generals (e.g. Józef Bem), we were under shared Austrian rule (part of Poland: Galicia), the Visegrád Congress (1335), the Visegrád Group (after the Cold War), inspiring each others' uprisings against the Soviets, and general acts of kindness throughout the ages (e.g. taking Polish WW2 refugees despite disapproval of German ally)
Poland is certainly on the list, but Romania
Fair enough
Substitute Romania for Russia
I mean I've had my reasons for putting it on the list, but yeah, I've completely forgot Russia
Probably because as I went to school, Russia was kinda still the bad guy that fucked us up (thus we've kept our interest at a minimum), whereas nowadays we're somehow besties again
Depends on the interpretation
Romania as a kingdom
Romania as current day Transylvania
Yes
Most of the general ideas like enlightenment, industrialisation or colonisation are approached through Britain or France, but mostly Britain
There are also whole pages dedicated to England and Britain, like the Magna Charts, War of the Roses, Cromwell's rebellion is a whole lecture, than they are coming back and back again in the 19th century
If you think about it we don't really learn about Austria, only what they did to us
The only thing I can recall about Austria from history classes is that they were more industrious in the dual monarchy
General ideas and historical trends like general estate, colonisation or industrialisation are usually approached through British history or sometimes french
We also learn about the hundred years war, civil war and medieval England
If we look at the overall history of Hungary, I believe that Romania's involvement in that history is rather insignificant before the 20th century
Now I'm not saying that we didn't have anything to do with each other, since we did have interactions with Wallachia and Moldavia, but I think that none of those events are as important as WW1, the Hungarian-Romanian war, the Treaty of Trianon, the 2nd Vienna Award, etc
I guess you interpreted this question in a whole different way than I did
Yeah, your points also make a lot of sense
I thought the question is about what we learn in school, and which countries we learn the most about in school
Thanks for the unwanted passive-aggression
Yes, a thousand times
Some random nonsense that comes to mind
* Megacorporations will continue to gain power
They'll eventually outgrow governments
A movement to democratize corporations will appear
* The decreasing powers of states will lead to balkanization of Spain, the UK and the US, possibly others
* EU might federalize, but will continue to fade in power like the nation states themselves
* *Stopping climate change* -> *Reversing climate change* -> *Coping with climate change*
* The world might eventually start carbon capture, out of neccessity, to stall the rising CO2 levels, making space mining profitable
* Some parts of the planet might become uninhabitable
* Cities will overall look similar to today, just bigger in size
No flying cars
* Internet will be policed much more thoroughly
* AI will continue to improve
We will slowly grow used to AIs
There will not be an AI takeover/Skynet
* We will not crack FTL space travel, and focus only on our solar system

We have an entire r/Fosttalicska
Well the Hide The Pain Harold meme originated in Hungary, so we really we carry it on our hearts
Not too long ago Viktor Orbán changed his profile pic on FB, which for some reason was worth giving [a news report] about, and without needing to say, this became a meme template on r/FostTalicska (Hungarian memes sub)
Also the Mézga Géza Drake meme, but I don't see it as much anymore
And don't forget r/SzarFurik and r/FostTalicskaUnchained
Also [Orbán Viktor]  and [Macskafogó screenshots] are popular too
Don't forget the queen of nyunyuka, Müller Cecília
Also the way too literal translation of memes, and of course Blaha
>Bojler eladó.
I'm Hungarian, but I've never understood why that's supposed to be funny
[Origin] for it
Köszi
(Thanks
Poland for sure
Maybe our languages aren't the same, but our history has shared a path many times
And (at least by my experiences in Hungary) we have huge respect for each other
Poland, of course
We have always helped each other and this is true for today's politics as well (unfortunately we are both pretty bad right now)
There is a poem both in Polish and in Hungarian about our friendship
Hungarian one:
Lengyel, magyar, két jó barát,/Együtt harcol, s issza borát. (Translation: Polish, Hungarian, two great friends,/Together they fight and drink their wines
Idk the Polish one, sorry
Austria is still our big brother, and a lot of Hungarians want the empire back
But I don't think we look really promising for the Austrians
I feel like Hungary is the "annoying little cousin" of Austria
Another interesting thing I've heard is that we are great friends with Bulgarians
Nevertheless, I have never seen any examples to this, so I cannot verify it
So altogether Poland is first, Austria is second and Bulgaria is third, I guess
We don't really have neighbours that we are in a good relationship with
The problem is that nationalism is strong in Hungary and people tend to claim a bigger historical Hungary, which means they want back land from all of our neighbours
I'd say the closest we have to a bro is Germany
Historically, we shared language when we became a part of the Habsburg Empire, then we fought side by side in both WWs
We also traded a lot
German is also the second most popular foreign language here
It used to be even more popular, but as I realised recently people are reluctant to learn foreign languages
We both also had the same struggles, as we had nazi control with mass genocide, communist rule (even though only partially in Germany) and a loss of land and financial crisis as the result of losing wars
The key differance is that while German people accept their past and try to be better, struggling to have any nationalistic pride as a result, Hungarians are the opposite
We are strongly nationalistic, deny any wrong we did in the past (for example:WWII), blame others for our fuckups and instead of trying to not be assosiated with racism, antisemitism and xenophobia we embrace them
Of course it's not everyone, but this is the common theme I got so far
In addition, Austria is our cousin
We are step-countries
Yes, Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian are all Uralic languages, but I dont think we have any connection other than that
Did he really say that
I hate him even more now on
This feels like not getting invited to the cool kids’ party
Wow
I've been learning Dutch for 5 months and this was the first comment I fully understood
we are a raft of incels really
These are almost mandatory in Hungary as well
We do this in Hungary too
The groom has to do different tasks to win back his bride
Add our [emblem] on it, asymmetrically like on Slovenian and Slovakian flags, but a bit bigger because it's a complex one
I don't see why we shouldn't have it on our flag
I think the best redesign would be like [this post] but making the cross horizontal and putting red on the left and green on the right side would make it even better
The [Árpád-house flag] is also awesome in my opinion
Simple, but has more variety than the current one
Would change it back to [this]
The Holy Crown embodies the Hungarian state
A king, government, parliament, etc are just mere proxies to rule in the crown's stead
Therefor, having the crown on the flag makes perfect sense even if the country is a republic
but then again r/heraldry would praise it
The soviet one or the tsar's?
Yeah that was the old Soviet Emblem
We also had our current emblem but it was removed a few years back
You are right about the 1956 revolution
In 1957 and in 1989, Hungary received new coats of arms, but they were not included on official flags
Nowadays, you can find flags with the post-1989 coat of arms which are an unofficial design
I also prefer the tsar's
Amusing, absolutely unintelligible gibberish, mostly
Closest approximation I’ve seen is a drunk Finn trying to speak Turkish and Polish at the same time
A Thai guy once told me that it sounds like French to him
I've also been told by a French guy that it sounds like every other sound is an "e" (like in egg)
That's when I explained to him that " te tetted e tettetett tettet, te tettetett tettek tettese" is a correct Hungarian sentence
I’ve heard people say that it looks like someone smashed their head into the keyboard and hit enter
How can people talk like that
And why do Hungarians have so long words
They also say we talk way to fast .
A Polish friend once told me, that to him it sounds like Japanese
I like the drunk Finn analogy too tho
Somebody told me that it has kind of a medieval vibe to it
I've read on forums multiple times that some finns think hungarian sounds like japanese to them
That theory is considered very outdated and generally discredited though
Thank you poland for EVERYTHING
Poland
They are constantly supporting my country in EU politics
Thank you for starting the liberation of Hungary from the Turkish rule
Thanks Jan Sobieski
Thanks for Iceland for regularly giving us lots of points in Eurovision
We won't participate next year, regrettably
just at night
it's a house with a garden and a fence, not the american suburbs type where you just walk to the front door from the street without anything to stop you so i don't see the need during daytime
The door to our flat can be swung open by a breeze, so we have to lock it to keep it closed
I also feel safer like this
I know it's unlikely that someone would bypass the passcode at the entrance and then come up to our level to rob us while we are present, but it doesn't hurt to be pessimistic

In Hungarian it would look like this:
"János átverekedte magát a sötét erdőn a fogadóig, mikor észrevette, hogy elfelejtett pénzt vinni magával
There is a party called "Mi Hazánk Mozgalom" (Our Homeland Movement), and recently the party's vice-President shredded a book called "Meseország mindenkié", in which children could learn about acceptance of gay people and stuff, because it quote-unquote "propagates LGBT ideology to children and brainwashes them".
But her actions kinda backfired, because with that video and whole scandal of shredding the book she boosted the book's popularity, so yikes
Covid, and SZFE (University of Theatre and Film Arts) protests
The students blockaded the building and there was a protest a few days ago because the government wants to put it under the financiation of a foundation (instead of the state) in whose committee they ignored all the recommendation of the university staff
They appointed people who the university students and teachers find not suitable for the job and straight up hostile
They claim that this is a move by Fidesz to eradicate the independence of the institution
Fidesz claims that they are too illiberal and leftist therefore they want to reform the institution
Not just LGBT people, but any ethnic or disadvantaged minorities like disabled people or single or alcoholic parents
These are kind stories (sometimes versions of original stories) where the characters happen to be from these groups
They should help children who aren't from the best background or are bullied to accept themselves
Acceptance of oneself is the best weapon against these bitter nazis, so no wonder they are scared of that book
That's a bit of an exaggeration, but yes, it is quite warm for late October
This is what I heard, but:
For humanities: ELTE in Budapest
For sciences: The University of Debrecen
Well, not uninteresting per se but Germany always draws the short straw with me
I decided to go multiple times and then something *more interesting* always popped up last minute
Belarus
No offence, but
it's just there
I don't know anything about it
(Other than the recent happenings against Lukashenko's reign
Not mentioning countries I know nothing about
I’ve been to many European countries
Out of them I found Slovakia to be the most uninteresting
It’s just eh
A bit might even be depressing too
Sturovo, Bratislava, Kosice, I was like yeah okay whatevs
Sorry, not trying to offend, don’t have anything against the country, just answering the question
ukraine is definetely a shit place, at least the parts that are close to hungary
i mean if poverty is interesting from a touristical point of view, i guess not but otherwise
I really like Slovakia
You guys have many great castles, and cities, all connected to hungarian history
Pozsony is also amazing and the girls there are really hot
One of your towns near Pozsony is called Malacka what means Piggy in hungarian
The gold and silver mines in Middle Slovakia was the backbone of the Economy of the Kingdom of Hungary during the Middle ages
One of my great-great-grandfather was born in Nyitra to a relative wealthy italian family
He made a relation with a slovakian maid and they moved to Kecskemét when my great-great-great-grandfather disowned them
Edit: I accidentaly wrote my great great great grandfather disowned himself
My great great grandfather was disowned
>Malta
I don't know much about Malta but Maltese language is really interesting
Well its only there pretty recently so thats somewhat fair
Its had 5 years of independence between 1917 & 1922, then its is own thing since 1990
Lukoshenko has ruled that country since 94, so 26 years out of 30 (or 26/35 if we feel generous)
slovenia is a hidden gem but if you're not interested in nature, you could be right
It has so many caves its insane
Place is like swiss chese
Here in hungary every fucking stalagtite and stalagtite is national treasuee, you are not allowed to touch it, or shine the wrong type of lamp on it
They discover 6-12 new caves per year
And i seen shops selling stalagtite
And ofc
Nazis used the drop them down (then drop a hand greande after if you feel mercyful) technique there
Sure they have a short-ish but nice coastline, however the interior is of the country is stunning
And sadly a single genocide sposored by the catholic church wasnt enough, to make people learn the virtue of moderation, its to be expected as its in the balkans, but still sad
Hmm i'm kinda happy you didn't mentiones us there
But I have to argue with you
The sea is just isn't that interesting
It's just, water, salty water
A Lake is just so much better
You need to go spelunking if you thunk mountains without sea are boring
There are ridiclous numbers of caves in the balkans
Places like the postojna cave system are a must see imho
And carst based river systems are also extremely beutiful, like the plitvice lakes national park
I'm only familiar with western Ukraine, but the Ukrainian Carpathians are gorgeous
Like, picture postcard idyllic
And Ukrainians are just generally fun to hang out with
Lviv is beautiful, although it still has a bit of the old Socialist-era grime
(I've only briefly visited Poland and Slovakia, so I can't really speak on those
Poland has the mine that inspired moria
That sounds something my group of friends and I would be into, thanks for the idea
Australia is just a buffer state between the Indian and the Pacific Ocean
I've been to Luxembourg City and it was quite beautiful
that does sound right up my alley
once covid is over i'm going then :D
>Austrian Hungarian empire, you know the place we spend hundreds of years with
AH lasted from 1867 until 1918
Before that Slovakia was part of the Habsburg Empire from 1526
Before that Slovakia was part of the Kingdom of Hungary
Before that Slovakia was part of the Great Moravian Empire
In 2018 they had one of the most creative stage shows without any fancy expensive equipment like pyrotechnics
It means something like this:
Municipalty of goats
:o brother
my name is comes from a Karl May novel (uncontiously, I thought I cam up with the name)
Depending where you come from inside Hungary
Sure you havd the nics transsilvania, however there are still some very pristine areas left on the great plain, in the forested hillls of the country's western half, the mountains in close to the northwestern border, and the swampy regions around the river tisza, the border with croatia slovakia, and the marsh region around the "little balaton".
Its not all just farms & artificial landscape (unlike the rgion that borders Romania)
Well its an intresting village
>Asian in an interesting way
Hmmmm
asian
Its interesting never felt asian
Except when I accidentaly walked into a chinese döner "restaurant" that felt asian
While you are at it poland also  with european bisons
Hungary is a buffer state between the Paprika Empire and human society
I'm in a similar situation with Ljubljana
Germany
Austria
Potato potato
I would say Tito is preferrable to genocide
There was a charcter whom (not real) name was Don Parmesan, I use that on many sites, but somehow it was already taken on reddit/ reddit didn't let me use it
Therfore am I Sir Parmesan
I dont know the english name
In hungarian it is: Az inka öröksége (something the Heritage/Heirdom of the Inca)
However nordics lake karst cave systems, if i recall correctly outside iceland they lack geothermal lakes, sand dunes ...etc
Ofc
they have other nice stuff
Just because their landscape is more exotic to you, doesnt make it somehow "better".
>Btw did you know that pretty much all Estonian kids read read "A Pál-utcai Fiúk" at school
WOW no
Why, because we have related languages
If so send me some Estonian poetry/literature, because we dont really have time for international literature on literature class (except the esential greeks, romans and latins) I liked it as a kid, it has an interesting story
My bad
My main point is that the fact thatstrictly hierarchich catholic organisations condoned (if not recomended) their members for participating in genocide, then later gave asylum for them should reduce blind faith
Which it did not
No, I dont speak slavic languages
But good to know :D
Well I think there is like 3 interpretations for cute  (source: am a girl)
When said about an action, phrase etc: it’s positive
It can be sarcastic but it’s rarer
When said about a guy (in a romantic context): mostly the meaning is I’m not attracted but I’m being pushed to form an opinion and trying to be nice about it
When someone’s calling a girl cute: really depends on the tone, can be positive but sometimes there is the undertone that it means naive/“too innocent” to get something
Soo cute is a complicated word
Better use something with a clearer meaning lol
They also say it when nice gestures are done (giving flowers etc)
Our governments purpose is to funnel Eu and Hungarian tax payer money to oligarchs and people close to the government/Orbán.
We're officaly the second most corrupt country in Europe, but we must have paid much to not to be the first most corrupt
Yes
The Government is a big maffia
As I know, a few years ago, Hungary was the second most corrupt country (at least in the EU) and that is only because we paid Bulgaria to be the most corrupt instead
Orbán is a corrupt asshole and he is running our country to the ground
Fuck him
I saw recently an article that Netherlands is the least corrupt country
Partially true, partially it isn't.
You see most tenders won by Orban friendly corporations because there's literally no other corporation that can do them
Sure, some western company would be able to do it, but for the same or higher prices
While those western companies also take all the profit out of the country with them, while national companies at least invest some of it in new constructions
Do those companies get shittons of profit
Of course
Is there any other choice
Not much
Each coin has two sides and we must see both to make informed decisions
Bulgaria
I have to disapoint you, but there are other worse countries than yours :)
I think it might be [Gyöngyhajú Lány by Omega] It's the most popular one too
Nah, it's Numa numa
Moonlight Sonata has to be it
I live in Budapest commie block
It's getting worse year by year, since the Homeless Law is enforced, a lot of them found my neighborhoods abandoned buildings
Alcohol and drug abuse is very common here, also begging and robberies are not rare
And I have to listen to their drunk screaming all night
I'm in Hilden right now, visiting family, what do you know about this town
Jeez, which part of the city
Csepel
Kőbánya
József Attila lakótelep a kilencben
I live in Óbuda in a classic panel and I have experienced none of that
I live in József Attila and we hear drunk screaming every night
Well some people joke abt that Lake Balaton dont exist
And obviously there are the jokes that say that Slovakia isnt real
Balaton
There is no lake Balaton in Hungary
It's a lie
Yea there is a joke that Romania does not exists
This is mostly trianon treaty related
(Explanation: (if you did not know already) a big % of Romania was hungarian (Transylvania, Bánság) and thats why
Well, we just say Romania doesn't exist
Does that count
Yeah but like 70% of your country will be underwater in the next 30yrs:( fuck global warming i wanted to visit
What’s Balaton
I’ve never heard of a place named like that
Oh wait, I remeber
My family disappears for a month in every summer to visit the Void next to Zala
Also, Csepel island is fake, it's an invention of the old communist regime so that they can fish there without the Soviet Union's knowledge
Lake Balaton is just an optical illusion and it became propaganda later
Seriously, there is a big FB group about it
Slovakia
Someone, who came from northern Hungary, said that they came from Slovakia
Their dialect is horrible, like they'd speak russian
Is "Slovakia" some slang term for the Tatra, or what
I know
Hmm interesting
Theres a county called Zala in Hungary
Edit: no its not a transylvania is hungary joke
Zala is in transdanubia
I've been there multiple times on hikes
Beautiful forests
Yeah i think it shows how hard the global warming can hit
I've heard that it was a nice region back then but then it went through desertification and it became the void we all pretend to be 'Balaton'.
Lol nice
Its actually Fertő tó in hungarian
I heard that slovakia is the english translation of felvidék
This is Zilah/Szilágy
Definitely not Máramaros, but with the various border-vacillations in the last thousands of years it can be both of the other two
Yes, they were manufactured at Area B (where Balaton supposedly is)

János, István, Kristóf, Zsigmond, Boldizsár, Mária, Krisztina, András, Mihály, Mózes, Gábor, Katalin, György, Ferenc, Ákos, Imre, Miklós
House of Habsburg:
Ferdinánd, Miksa, Rudolf, Mátyás, Lipót, József, Károly, Mária, Terézia, Ferenc
Men: István, Péter, Sámuel, András, Béla, Salamon, Géza, László, Kálmán, Imre, Vencel, Ottó, Károly, Lajos, Zsigmond, Albert, Ulászló, Mátyás, János, Ferdinánd, Miksa, Rudolf, Lipót, József, Ferenc
Women: Mária
We would be fine, tbh:
Álmos, Árpád, Zoltán, Fajsz, Taksony, Géza, Vajk, István(Stephen), Péter(Peter), Sámuel(Samuel), András(Andrew), Béla, Salamon, László(Ladislaus), Kálmán(Coloman), Imre(Emeric), Vencel(Venceslaus), Ottó(Otto), Károly(Charles), Lajos(Louis), Mária(Mary), Zsigmond(Sigismund), Albert, Ulászló(Vladislaus), Mátyás(Matthias), János(John), Ferdinánd(Ferdinand), Miksa(Maximilian), Rudolf, Lipót(Leopold), József(Joseph), Mária Terézia(Maria Theresa), Ferenc(Francis) and Ferenc József(Francis Joseph)
If we add consorts to the mix as well, there would be enough female names too:
Sarolt, Gizella(Giselle), Judit(Judith), Anasztázia(Anastasia), Richeza, Synadena, Adelhaid(Adelaide), Felícia(Felicia), Eufémia(Euphemia), Heléna(Helena), Eufrozina(Euphrosyne), Jaroszlávna(Yaroslavna), Ágnes(Agnes), Margit(Margaret), Konstancia(Constance), Gertrúd(Gertrude), Jolán(Yolanda), Beatrix(Beatrice), Erzsébet(Elisabeth), Fenenna, Viola, Barbara, Katalin(Catherine), Anna, Izabella(Isabelle), Eleonóra(Eleonore), Mária Anna(Maria Anna), Mária Leopoldina(Maria Leopoldine), Margit Terézia(Margaret Theresa), Klaudia Felicitász(Claudia Felicitas), Eleonóra-Magdaléna(Eleonore-Magdalena), Vilma Amália(Wilhelmine Amalia), Erzsébet Krisztina(Elisabeth Christine), Mária Lujza( Maria Luisa), Mária Ludovika(Maria Ludovika), Karolina Auguszta(Caroline Augusta), Mária Anna(Maria Anna) and Zita
Hungary would be full with people called László, István, Géza, Árpád, András, Béla, Kálmán. Which is roughly the actual case
How do you eat Hungarian cottage cheese pasta
Some eat it as a "salty"/spicy meal (with bacon, pepper etc
) others eat it with sugar+sour cream
There are different names for the two
Late to the party, but still: do Greeks indeed use a singular looking form (gyro) of "gyros"?
I always thought the proper name for the food was gyros, and the Americans thought it's a fake plural form and took the -s from the end
Like they pronounce Porsche like "porsh".
On behalf of Hungary, I agree in the Schnitzel dispute
But there is one exception: there is a similar dish to the Cordon Blue where breaded, fried pork is stuffed with bacon and smoked cheese
That dish MUST include a topping consisting of garlic sour cream and grated cheese
In Hungarian, tomatoes are called "paradicsom" which also means "paradise".
Hold up
Is this something like the cases in Latin (and other Indo-European languages)
What is nominativ singular in this case
(reminder: Hungarian is not an Indo-European language, but we do use an analogue system of cases, only we don't have 4 like German or 7 like the Slavs, but 2x17
:D )
Well, I always thought of Hungary as a small country, but on a European scale, we aren't THAT small
I mean, we are smaller than Bulgaria, but we are bigger than the majority of our neighbours (only Romania and Ukraine are bigger)
We are also bigger than B&H and many other balkan states
And to go to Western Europe, we are bigger than Switzerland, Portugal, Belgium, NL, Denmark
And don't even get me started on the Nordic countries, like Sweden and Finland
Population-wise, however most Westerners beat us
I can't get my head around how 17M people fit in a country 40% the size of Hungary
(Talking about the NL)
And if something happens in Hungary, it'll only make it to international news if it happened in Budapest
But not a chance in hell any other city will be "famous".
And speaking of Budapest, that's the only city most people know are in Hungary
And some even confuse it with Bucharest and vice-versa
Just for the sake of context, sitting here, I can name and locate Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht and Haarlem on the map of the Netherlands
In Hungary we like to blame literally everything on being small
I wouldn't say Bulgaria is a small country, but a medium country
>And the one that boils my blood the most is being called a third world country
It's never ever meant as just an innocent statement
Well Jugoslavia was the leader of the "third world/non-aligned" movement
US and its allies were the "1st world", USSR and its group was the "2nd world", and the rag-tag bunch of others like nasser's egypt, Jugoslavia and the like were the "3rd world".
Its not necessarily and insult, its just people are fucking dumb, and never learnt history
Well then we have some thing in common with you here in Hungary
(pride in language, overexgarrated notion of uniqueness, being obsessed with foreigners knowing about us ...etc
Same size and population as Hungary
> arent any major events in the capitals
I mean a "major event" in the Balkan region usually has to do with a war, so it's maybe better this way
That's strange
I thought they must sell stuff like electronics with manuals in all official langauages of the European Union, like the manual itself is 3-4 pages long but it's thick as a book because of that
Luxemburg is not small, it's tiny
I would also add stuff like, since we are less known and people don't hear anything about stuff happening here, people tend to go crazy if even a little thing is about Hungary in an international setting, be that some sports achievement, famous people, companies, or anything culturally related to Hungary that make it to the mainstream Internet
I think that's probably a small country thing
Maybe also a bit of internationalism, like many people go abroad constantly cause every country is so close, and sometimes rely on neighboring countries
I remember being skiing to Austria and all the adverts on the lifts were in Hungarian
I live near the capital and I can be in Slovakia in an hour
People living in bigger countries probably don't experience this much exposure to other countries
The extreme other end was in the UK where I saw people view other parts of Europe as exotic holiday destinations and their cultures very different from their own, which I couldn't imagine doing here
Because it is small, even on a European scale
It's not a Luxemburg, but still smol
I mean at least you are all Slavic
They sometimes say that about Hungary "Is that in Russia
Don't worry that much about grammar
If you are a foreigner, and learn enough, to do "stupid hungarian" by simply using words without grammar, people will get most of it, and you will get respect for the effort
Ofc
if you plan to stay, then it will be a bitch
I recommend you the _Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook_ from Monty Python
My hovercraft is full of eels
(obligatory note: the "Hungarian" line he says is gibberish)
We consider ourselves small
Yes he is, why
Nah, everything east of Germany is Russia, everyone knows that
Even
Austria and Greece
I know but what does he have to do with the size of his home country
Man, you should have seen us in the 14th century
Iceland always gives us some points in Eurovision which we appreciate very much
But isn't Austria the country with the kangaroos
Oh my god, raccoon translates to washing bear here too
We call a raccoon a mosómedve
Can we talk about why Austria got territory from Hungary despite us both being part of the Axis
Wrong question
Cannot and won't be answered
It's just what it is and that's at least partly we don't have borders
Let's keep it that way
Isn't the reason for Burgenland's situtation that it was part of Hungary which had generally been less developed than Austria
Wrong war fam
Wrong war
Because this is WW2
Different war
He could have lobbied for us, too
In his later years, he spent much time in Hungary, part of his family still resides in Hungary, and he was much more popular here than in Austria
Joke from that time:
"How long would it take if (Nazi) Germany tried to occupy Hungary
"With resistance or without
"With resistance
"12 hours
"And without
"24 hours
"How so
"Because the welcoming speeches would delay them
Am I the only one who actually *UNIRONICALLY* listens to that
I love that song
Denmark is the new Germany
Highway D1
Construction started in 1972, we were told that the highway will be completed by 1999, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2013, 2026
Spoiler: It will not be
Maybe in 2030
The plan was to make a highway from Košice in Eastern Slovakia (Biggest city) all the way to Bratislava in Western Slovakia, basically across the whole country
At the early stages it was okay construction went fine, they slowly built parts of the highway, then in 2006 came (a corrupt prime minister that actually lead the country until 2019) Robert Fico, they promised that the highway will be done by 2010, 2013
60% Of the highway is actually done, but more than 200 Kilometres are still missing, of course its in Eastern Slovakia
Thats a short story about our highway that has been in construction for 48 years now and it will be 58 or even 60
Welcome to Slovakia
Recently read about a length of railway (on flat land) that cost more than if they had placed as many luxury SUVs back to back as needed to reach the distance
The flour and sugar f***ing ran out
Yes, and I'm so fucking tired of it all
I'd rather catch coronavirus than read another headline about it
I mean almost everyone is gonna catch it anyway, no amount of panicing and stockpiling is gonna save you
I'm pretty sure the panic is gonna cause more harm than the actual virus
It's not even that deadly
There's a joke going around that the cure to COVID must surely be pancakes, because people are buying flour, oil and sugar in bulk
That's been the case for nearly the past two weeks
It also shows how  piss poor supply chain management is in Hungary
You guys have that
Oh poor people
We had that like for more than a year, and it was awful
But then Orbán backed out when it seemed very likely that there would be an election about that
It shows that they are in control
They have the power to control your free time
There are loads of jobs which require to work on Sundays, so it's hypocritical to save the shop workers from working on the holy day
But not being able to do the shopping whenever you want is an inconvenience for almost everyone
You should always remember who's the boss
At least this was the meaning in Hungary
Yes
You know, if you move the cursor over the link, it shows where it goes
I always forget about important people
And aren't any better things to do than complaining about this
Gamer moment
Same tho
Gypsies have/had an affinity to pick Latin American names, after the Brazilian, Argentinian and Mexican soap operas that were very popular in the 90s and early 00s.
Hungarian naming laws only allow phonetic spellings, so you get a lot of Rikárdós, Ármándós, Dzsesszikas, Dzsennifers, Tifanis
Turkish soap operas have gotten more popular in the past decade, so maybe we'll start hearing about all those Kolompár Ibrahims soon
There are many masculine names, which have terrible feminine counterparts
For example there's the perfectly normal name of Márton(, Hungarian vers
of Martin)
The female version of the name just lazily slaps "-ella" at the end of the name and the resulting "Mártonella/Martonella" is a real torment for the ear
American sounding names in general, but especially when they spell it like it was Hungarian (eg
Jennifer --> Dzsennifer)
When a normal name ends in an "i" but they spell it with a "y" (eg
Fanni-->Fanny)
This is a recent trend: naming girls something unusual, like plants (Pálma, literally Palm) and fungi (Csiperke, literally Champignon)
I have a friend named Turul and he hates his parents for it
Some people are trying way too hard to give their kids Ancient Hungarian names
Like, an 8 year old kid named Koppány, or Ajtony, or a little girl called Sarolt
This isn't the Song of the Miraculous Hind, fuck, give them a normal name
I met a kid once who was called Vitéz. That's not even a name
It's literally just an old Hungarian word that means "warrior". It sounds exactly like if an English-speaking person met a kid called Warrior Johnson
One of his brothers was called Sólyom ("falcon")
Pretentious fuck of a parent
Acceptable exceptions are ancient names that are commonly used
Attila, Sarolt**a**, Csanád, Csongor, Hunor, Gyöngyvér are fine
In hungarian i think one of the worst names are Norbert for male and Laura for female
(Sorry Norbert's and Laura's)
Lol, randi means date in hungarian
Intresting stuff
and Molly
Tbf Arno and Hedda sound sorta ok
Is Ann-Nina pronounced Anina
The latter one is already a name, isn't it
Oh wait I completely forgot about "vityaz"! So it isn't even Hungarian in origin
Incredible
Yes, from it's Hungarian equivalent, randevú.
Ah, thanks, I didn't know the correct spelling
I think for Hungary the big ones are: The hologram, color television, and safety matchsticks
Ball-point pen, Excel, nuclear weapons, safety matches, dynamo, Rubik's cube, colour TV etc
Rubiks Cube (named after Rubik Ernő)
Atomic bomb (Leo Szilárd), holography, safety match, ballpoint pen, electric motor, modern computer, helicopter, Vitamin-C. **These are the most important hungarian inventions that we learn about in school, and you can also find proof on the internet
I'm not sure but I know something that probably all you have or had at home:
The rubik's cube
We made the rubic's cube, thats kinda cool
We also made the ballpoint pen (although some people disagree, im just here to say what the majority says)
Although not an invention but Albert Szent-györgyi discovered vitamin-C.
Tivadar Puskàs invented the telephone exchange
Although not a positive inventions, rather a destructive one
Edward Teller (or Teller Ede, we call him) invented the hydrogen bomb
Dènes Gàbor invented the hologram, wich is cool
We have 12 nobel prizes, the 16th most
And a moon crater is named after a Hungarian man Zsigmondy (just a fun fact)
For Hungary I would say the ball point pen
And there was a Hungarian involved in inventing the computer but it's not really Hungarian
I'm not sure about this one, since according to our overly nationalistic people every 2nd thing was invented by hungarians, but the principle behind the modern computer (if true) is the biggest hungarian invention by John von Neumann: en
wikipedia
org/wiki/John_von_Neumann
ballpoint pen
Made by Bíró László I believe
We also made x-ray (this is where the word roentgen comes from, originally röntgen
We also found a reliable source of c-vitamin in paprika, We also made the rubik's cube, We made safety matches, These were all made by Hungarians, just a lot of them were made outside Hungary by Hungarian people
Shame some leaders dont like it
Also helicopter, atomic bomb (Leó Szilárd was the first man that realized it is possibble to make weapons using nuclear technology, he also took a big part in the Manhattan project)
Vitamin-C, Electric motor, and a few more
The handwashing thing was Semmelweis' invention
Yes Yes, there are plenty
Well, they always tell us about these at school, the safety match was invented by Irinyi János (that one is a bit controversial tho), the holograms inventor is Gábor Dénes And The color tv-s is Goldmark Péter Károly
It was a team effort that involved quite many Hungarians
Sorry, I thought I had my user flair on even though I didn't. It's Hungary, the dynamo was invented by Ányos Jedlik
Not exclusively Hungarians, but a significant amount of the scientists of the Manhattan Project were Hungarians
Ah, thanks for reminding mate
Well, these are weird because both the color tv and the safety match were invented by many People simultaniously but we claim that we were the first ones
Also who could forget the Rubiks cube, and the documents we smuggled from germany to help in the construction of the atomic bomb
Yeah i almost forgot we have a dictator lol
Highway tolls
Booths, stickers, electronic registration, pay by time, pay by distance, getting fined right after crossing the border because you didn't buy it in advance
Big jumbled mess
Also, low/zero-emission zones are random even inside the same countries
Overall, the Vienna Convention could use a v2
"náci" és "komcsi" (nazi and commie) are used as insults but not in general speak just political "discussion". Are you say "ávós" is still used
Many Hungarians (that don’t miss the communist days) consider the communist government as an occupying soviet government
Ask a few ossies, the soviets were an occupying power
Both of our countries expressed our wishes of them leaving ('53 and '56), and they declined the offer quite violently
Szerintem az nem kötődik megszálló hatalomhoz
Hajjaj, messze nem
Amikor pl
a haláltáborba vagy munkaszolgálatra küldött emberek házát meg vagyonát lehetett "megörökölni" akkor komoly spiclihemzsegés volt
Sokkal rövidebb ideig tartott
Meg a kommunistáknak besúgással még a nyolcvanas években is lehetett sikert aratni, a németeknek/nyilasoknak besúgással meg nem annyira
Én is ismerek távolról embert akiről tudjuk, hogy spicli volt, de nyilván nem 44ben
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing
Crysis Warhead
The wiki page lists more but I've never heard of those and I live here, so I guess they aren't well known
We're not known for making games but at least we don't really get offical translation anymore either
Weeeee, here goes the independent gamers who translate games for us for freeeee\~
Imperium Galactica
(can't believe nobody else could post this)
ETS2 is probably my favourite game
I put more than 700 hours in ETS2 and almost 200 hours in ATS
There’s a great Netflix mystery/crime thriller from Iceland called Trapped
I’d highly recomend if you enjoyed Dark, but I prefer it to Dark
Has a unique atmosphere, beautiful shots, good characters
I first heard of it from Slavoj Zizek and he’s a big fan as well
i watched like 2 seasons, i liked the first one but it got more and more confusing over time so i dropped it
i don't really know anyone here who likes it but i've seen it recommended a bunch of times on reddit
Dubbed is so fucking shit
It is the normal in Hungary and there’s big industry for it, everything is dubbed
It has a bad affect overall on the level of people’s English too
Subbed is infinitely better
Thank you Austria, Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia for not being racist and not abusing Hungarian minority
Austria for helping us out every time we were in need
During the Dual Monarchy they helped to build our economy and rebuilt my city (Szeged) after it got destroyed by a flood
During the XX
century they opened their borders during the revolution of 1956 and has been helping ever since
They are generally good cousins
I want to thank Slovakians for helping me off a big ass mountain when I went skiing for 1 day and I thought that at the end of my first day I had big enough balls to go down on an intermediate course
Fuck me dude they had to call in the Snowmobile because it took me an hour to ski down 200m. They were understanding tho so cheers
Well, it’s complicated
Good question
Thank you Austria for carrying our ass in the Middle Ages
Without you (and your financial support), we would've been a part of the Ottoman Empire
As a Hungarian a I can’t relate :(((
We went with German influence twice, third time the charm
Are we good neighbours
We are like the German and France of Eastern Europe, frenemy for hundreds of years
Well she was generally evil
Haha, well I guess that depends on your political view
In my opinion if someone was fiecly against worker rights or the German unification is enoguh to be called evil
Especially since she was a damm talented politician
Well she opposed German unification, that's just a fact
>So did Mitterrand
Yes, but when the unification happened he was supportive
Don't misunderstand me, I see that the German unification was against British interests but I still find it sad that a this important person like her can openly be against the rightful unification of a country that was torn into two by foreign powers
I stand corrected, I learned even at school that she was strongly opposing it till her death and even called the Unified Germany a "monstrosity"
Márka is a popular brand of soft drink, kinda like Fanta elsewhere
It was made during the communist times, until the early 1990s, when, I believe, the factory was closed
It was resurrected in 2006 by a Hungarian entrepreneur, and now, it’s very popular
Traubiszóda or Traubi Soda
It's a carbonated white grape soda
It's even got a certificate of being kosher, so you can drink it at passover
When I was in Dresden, and asked for Almdudler, they stared at me as if they hadn't seen an idiot before
Kima is so amazing, by far the best soda I had abroad
Tell me, Faxe Kondi tastes so much like Sprite, are they related
I hate it
It is a worthless new feature that nobody likes
Well done Google, well done
it's absolute fucking garbage
i have Yt set to English (obviously), but now it translates everything to English instead, and that's almost as annoying as translating to Hungarian
Kádár is very interesting, because there is great nostalgia about his time, but it is never connected to communism
Like, saying "under Kádár things were better" is not uncommon, but saying you are a communist is totally taboo, I guess because the appeal of that system is that it didn't demand ideological devotion, just passivity
I have the feeling hungarians are not really concerned with communism from the economic angle like Americans, most narratives of it are either cultural (they were anti-christian) or nationalistic (they were Soviet puppets)
I don't think anybody wants Rákosi back, it's definately taboo
Horthy is also interesting
There were open elections, and most of the opposition was pacified, but Horthy's party only got 40-50% of the vote, so sometimes it's called a Limited democratic, or a Hybrid regime
Definately a lots of nostalgia for him, and I think Orbán also wants to recreate that period
To what extent is Horthy to blame for everything that happened under ww2 is still debated, and if you call out someone on praising Horthy expect a long, pointless debate spanning three decades of historical questions
The fact that he got overthrown by someone worse helps a lot to vindicate him, even though the main deportations happened under his reign, although under german occupation
As for Szálasi, that's pretty taboo, only unapologetic neo-nazies do that
There is not much to like about his reign either, he was a german puppet during the last strech of ww2
It's just that said neo-nazies are obsessed with this idea of honor and loyalty to our german brothers in arm (as if the nazies weren't considering us inferior)
People praise the hell out of both the fascist and communist dicatorship and not just the boomers
Not at all, on the contrary
Far-right is the most popular ideology in hungary, so our fascist ww2 leader Horthy gets a lot of praise
And, despite the fact that everyone hates communism, the last communist leader Kádár also gets some praise from the elderly from time to time
We as a nation are just not grown up enough for democracy, that's why we failed to sustain it every time
We can just hope it doesn't degrade much beyond this hybrid regime
Bitching about them is a national pasttime
Regardless if its bitching about goulash communism, or bitching about the Horthy regency
None of them is taboo tho
It's an open part of history, noone's gonna sush you down, or feel uncomfortable for talking about it
Absolutely English
It's partially how I learned to speak English in the first place, so it just feels natural that way
Also, translations of well known gaming terms like HP or Mana etc
can be pretty cringe
Most of the games does not have Hungarian translation
Soo
And most of the games that have Hungarian translation, it is bad
English most of the time, because of mod compatibility
I don't, and the best example I can give why is that in Left 4 Dead the special infected have DIRECT TRANSLATIONS of their names
Kinda awkward and funny, but I'd rather play in english
Maybe because of light conditions
Austria doesn't get dark in the middle of the afternoon, so there's less opportunity for them
Sure, there is night, just less of it in winter
That's why I said "less" opportunity, not none, of course
It's probably mostly cultural
Just never caught on for whatever reason
Anyway, I've been in northern Finland several years
For around a month around Dec
21, it just never really gets properly light
It's just kind of
murky
And Finns seem a little obsessed with lighting (for half the year)
The only explosion that comes to my mind is the explosion of the Biatorbágy viaduct in 1931, as a terror attack by Szilveszter Matuska
However, there were probably larger explosions during WW2
Before I even start, I just want to open by saying that I feel so much gratitude to be living in Europe in this day and age, when we look at each other as the same people, as **Europeans,** and not as the rivals our forefathers looked at each other
# Dear Slovakia & Romania
I would love nothing more than for all 3 of us to stop whining about what we did to each other 100 years ago, and move forward and actually treat each other like fellow Europeans
# Dear Croatia
To say the least, historically our treatment of Croats might not have been the best, but I want all the Croats of r/AskEurope to know that I absolutely love your country, and your coastal cities are the best places for any Hungarian to spend a summer holiday in
I swear to God it's cheaper than going to the Balaton sometimes
# Dear Austria
Of all our neighbours, you guys are the most civilized, and frankly, the most European
You are the country Hungary wishes to be, and the country Hungarians wish to live in
It's not a coincidence that Austria is Hungary's only neighbour whose Hungarian minority is constantly growing
# Dear Poland
The saying "Polak, weiger dwa bratanki" has been true all throughout history, and it is true even today
As of today, we are struggling together under a pathetic excuse of a government, and I can only hope that we can get rid of them sooner or later
LGBT-free zones
Where do these people think they are
The Middle East
Such places have no place in Europe
Love to each and every Pole on this subreddit
# Dear Finland & Estonia
Even though our countries are in no way similar, I still feel kinship with you guys, as we (arguably) speak a few of the most unique languages on Earth, but sadly our languages are the only Uralic languages that will survive in the long run, as others have no sole official status anywhere in the world and the number of native speakers are ever decreasing
# Dear Russia
To me, you're a whole other universe in Europe, and I mean that in the most positive way imaginable
Your cities have an athmosphere no other places have
Seriously, when I was in Saint Petersburg, standing in front of the Winter Palace I felt something I've never felt anywhere else ever
And going on the Transsiberian Railway is a bucket list item of mine
# Dear Greece
So much of everything we in the Western world know and love today has some connection to Greece
And Greek Mythology is the best thing I have ever looked into
Your history, your language, your islands, your cities, your cuisine and most importantly, your people
Literally everything about this country is as wholesome as it gets
Love to the Greeks
# Dear Ireland
Ireland has a special place in my heart, even though barely anything connects me to this country
But I've always thought that Ireland is a country everyone loved for no specific reason
You people are just awesome, and your accents, especially the **South Dublin** accent is the sexiest, and most beautiful English accent I've ever heard
Eargasm everytime someone speaks in that accent
And I've always loved the fact that Ireland is the only country to have legalised same-sex marriage via popular vote
I view it as the openness of the Irish
# Dear Netherlands
Without any intention to offend any of you, your language is the funniest thing I've ever seen and heard
I have had an acquaintance refer to the Dutch language as "English with Down syndrome". I want to know how you feel about this analogy
But on a serious note, I have always appreciated how open and accepting the Dutch society is, and I will repeat myself here, but I love the fact that the Netherlands was the first country in the entire world to legalize same-sex marriage
Best of wishes to the Dutchies
# Dear Germany
The reason I left you for the end, is because I have the most to say about you
I just want to start by saying that I have nothing but endless respect and admiration for Germany and the German people
The way Germany made a complete U-turn and transformed from the Third Reich into what we know and love as Germany today, leaves me dumbfounded
And from my experience, it is very rare for a country to be so open about the darker chapters of its history
And sure, with all the evidence, it would be pretty stupid for Germany to even try to hide this, but it certainly didn't stop some countries from denying past attrocities
(Not going to say names, but we all know what countries I'm talking about)
I mean even I had to find out about the massacres of my own country from English sources on the Internet, so there is that
Germany has definitely learnt from the past (something which I can't really say about my country huh) and today is the beating heart of Europe
Best of wishes to Germany, the other countries I mentioned and the countries I didn't mention
(I could've written a shorter essay on most countries in Europe)
>Hungary: you're kinda mysterious to us, but you've actually contributed to our culture and economy throughout history (same with Austria, Italy and France, even Czech Republic/Bohemia to an extent)
Most Hungarians I know love Croatia and Croats
>Bosnia: amazing nature
Bullet dodged
<3 aaaaaaw
>Hungary: thank you for liking us (for what i’ve seen) and for liszt’s version of La Campanella
Thanks for having supported us during our '56 revolution
Avanti ragazzi di Pest
But
You have a crush on Germany
*Throws suprise flowers into the trashcan* I get it
True heroes of Europe
>"a Hungarian enters a revolving door behind you and leaves it before"
Im not sure if I get the meaning right, but it certainly feels right ''':D
Well, there are some bozos here who still cry about the Habsburgs, but cross that bridge you know
Objectively speaking, Austria is our best neighbour in every aspect
Now why you gotta attack me like that
There's actually 4 milk bars in Budapest, which were founded on traditions of previous milk bars
They're pretty cozy and yeah once in a while I went in, asked for a dl of milk and then went on my way
We say literally “in the middle of nowhere” or “behind god’s back” or “on the world’s ass”. Or funny sounding made up village names, like Bivalybasznád, bivaly meaning buffalo and basznád meaning “you would fuck (it/that)”.
A bit late to the party but we usually use fictional place names that sound funny like Bivalybasznád (bivaly-buffalo basznád-you'd fuck it/that) or Mucsaröcsöge which doesn't mean anything it just sounds sorta funny
There's also "where even the birds don't fly"
Don't forget the best "a halál faszán" literally meaning on death's dick
Also "senki földje", which means no man's land
There's also "where even the birds don't fly"
Kukutyin is also used in a similar context, but it is also exists
It is because Kukutyin is at the middle of the Hungarian Great Plain, which is the closest you can get to the middle of nowhere
Its the calm before the storm I think
Our ER has been even quieter than usual in the last couple of weeks but it would be foolish to assume that it won't change at any moment
As far as possible the government wants to treat COVID patients centrally in selected hospitals which were emptied for them
The rest of the institutions need to prepare too with designated ICUs and infection wards, isolation rooms etc
too, but are not going to treat such patients until the capacity of designated hospitals is exhausted
As for workers we are now banned from leaving the country but there are no further special measures - yet
Elective surgeries have been restricted to oncological ones, the rest are put on hold to save resources
Clinical rotations of med students has been suspended
My guesstimate is that up to 30-40% of people showing up as "emergencies" in fact do not require urgent care of any sort
Nonsensical complaints, chronic problems needing no special immediate care, people treating the ER as a one-stop shop where they can get their regular checkup (say the magic words and you get all kinds of diagnostic tests and imaging immediately) - the possibilities are endless
Many of these people now probably realized that the ER is not the best place to hang around without very good reasons at this time
Also staff is now wearing masks and there were some suspected cases (none of them COVID) too
~~transylvania~~
Schnitzel is not an Austrian only thing, for starters
*Ffs its just a joke pls dont kill me lol*
Nether had we, but the larger half of Europe didn’t either
Joke
Thank you kind redditor
~~who knows actually~~
Sure I can't say for all countries of Europe, but I think we just simply don't need them
:-)
I read it somewhere that the US has these because it was easier, cheaper and faster to expand upwards, but European cities had time
> ugly
Debatable (and survivors bias)
I think it's more about city planning
I quite like many modern building, including skyscrapers and they look absolutely stunning and great in modern cities like NY
Or when I visited China the newly built city centres with modern building looked great
And here's a real unpopular opinion: I like brutalism
The Barbican Estate in London is in my top3 buildings ever
No, it's because the Chief Architects of Budapest consistently don't approve buildings higher than the Parliament, so the cityscape isn't corrupted
Don't forget, the banks of the Danube are under UN World Heritage protection
The MOL tower which is under construction will be higher, though, and it actually created controversy
I don't think they're ugly either
On their own, they look good
The problem is the incoherence in these districts
We liked art nouveau, because they are coherent, yet each building can be somewhat unique in its own
Then we went for a bland copy-paste brutalism that lacks any individuum
Modern districts are completely individualistic and deny any coherent style and often has little connection to the local culture
You walk along a a street and find glass and steel boxes, glaring twisting buildings, post art nouveau, minimalist buildings, post-brutalist buildings, green eco buildings
All on one street
On their own, they can all look good, but together they're just a chaotic mess
Because of this, most modern cities are similarly chaotic, which makes them all look the same
>The MOL tower which is under construction will be higher, though, and it actually created controversy
Yeah, building that is a terrible idea
>The MOL tower which is under construction will be higher, though, and it actually created controversy
Yes, but as you can see, if they want, they change the regulations
Not the first time they don't care about the World Heritage protection
(for example the Budapest's city park, or the Buda castle what I remember)
But let's not go into politics :-)
We truly don't need them
We have 3 "halfscraper" at Árpád-híd, and they use
50% of it I think
In principle its not a terrible idea, you can build tall thing without making the place into a desert of glass
Imho you could continue most of the inner city buildings upwards in the style one of the building near the nyugati pályaudvar (western railway station) is done in
The so called Eiffel palace is very far from an eyesore sticking out of the cityscape
[This is how it looks from the ground
[This is how it looks from the air
I don't see why continuing it upward in the same style would create stylistic problems
That wouldn't. As we can see on the image, the Eiffel Palace is only a few floors higher than its surroundings
The MOL tower would be 100 m higher than anything around it, and would be the largest building in the city
And it probably wouldn't be nearly as good-looking as the Eiffel Palace, or, with your words, it would be:
>a desert of glass
>an eyesore sticking out of the cityscape
Yeah it depends on the surrounding
I would still think tall building could be done with grace
There is no issue with glass, if the bottom levels are don in style with the surrounding classical buildings, and you have narrow street, thus you cannot be disturbed by the glassy top from street level
And higher floors covered in glass don't look stupid when they are not a one off occurence sticking out like a sore thumb in the middle of nothing
If that high building is surrounded by similar ones at lower heights it won't be an eyesore
At the location it will be built it could have been fine
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
At the end of the day its far enough from the center that its not any worse than the chimney of the Kelenföld powerplant with its 200m height
,,Aki bújt, aki nem, megyek
,,Anyone hidden, and anyone who's not, I'm coming
Hungarian:
“Aki bújt, aki nem, jövök!”
Vigyázz, kész, jövök! - means Ready, done, im coming
“Aki bújt, aki nem, jövök!” (Who could hide, who couldn’t, I’m coming for you
Kész vagy nem, itt vagyok
Aki bújt, aki nem, jövök!
Aki bújt, aki nem, megyek
(Those who have hidden, those who have not, I'm coming
Aki bújt aki nem megyek
(Hungarian)
Aki bújt, aki nem, megyek / jövök!
Who has hidden, who has not, I’m coming
It's exactly the same for us too: "Aki bújt, aki nem, jövök!"
Hungarian
Yeah, looks like the same
Im finding more and more simular things between us and you, austrians
My Mexican friends tell me that the Spanish mock them for the differences in their pronunciation, and the use of some words that are used differently
...its arguable that Austria is older than Germany, thus they should have the monopoly on the language
But the whole question doesn't make much sense
Do Austrians say "baba" for saying goodbye informally
OMG, we say "pápá" for the same
What do Slovaks enjoy about Borovička is beyond me
I don't mind a mild juniper flavor and I like gin enough, but that stuff is just Satan's ball sweat
The new laws banning "incest" in France
I mean it bans something, just not what you would expect
Don't worry, those are just nationalists, e. g. in Hungary an average intellectual does not have a problem with Romanians at all
Those greek buildings were covered in graffiti sincd ancient times
Its noghinb out of ordinary
Turkey is as much a "muslim state", as France is a "Christian state" - both practice a borderline militant level (from the US viewpoint) separation of church and state
When modern Turkey was created by Atatürk - among other stuff - he abolished the caliphate, basically equivalent of banning the office of the Pope
Yeah
So incest is fine and dandy - in the eyes of the law
And we made a law banning "incest" by redefining incest
The most french thing ever, i get that, but why
No, he didn't say that
Hungarian nationalists are in Hungary as well (how surprising)
I think he meant that these people are dumb, and most of the Hungarians don't think the same
But don't get me wrong, you can find Romanians who are hardcore nationalists and against us
Cellux - sellotape
Vegeta - a type of seasoning
Rotring- mechanical pencil
Blu Tack - putty like adhesive
Mirelit - frozen foods
Jacuzzi - hottub
Thermos (termosz) - vacuum flask
Edit: I just remembered the most important one
Matchbox - little toy cars
Toi Toi is a hungarian portable toilet brand, we also call it toitoi, I wouldn't even know what would be its proper name
But they recently renamed the brand to yoo
which is so bad in my opinion
Ngl I had no idea that mirelit and termosz were  brand names
And there is more
Like flex, zetor and stihl all three are brand names but we use them for angle grinders, tractors and chainsaws
There's also Tixó which is the same thing as Cellux
We also call styrene "hungarocell".
I didn't know it was Hungarian, but it makes sense, since _Toi Toi_ wouldn't refer to its purpose in other languages
Yup, both are "sárkány". Kites are usually referred to as "papírsárkány" = paper dragon
I have something else that's interesting:
In english, "glass" means the material and also the object you pour liquid into for drinking
In hungarian, "üveg" means the same material, but also means bottle
Both languages use "glass" as a material to describe a liquid container, just a different kind
Yeah, both are sárkány, althought we usually add papír (paper) in front of it when meaning kite
Hungarian: Sárkány
And I don’t think you can get much more of an unrelated language than Hungarian in Europe xD
In Hungrian dragon is Sárkány, kite is (papír)sárkány, which means word by word "paper dragon".
Climbing on statues and making grafitis on them (later one done by locals mostly)
Drunk Brits are the worst
I don't know for sure, but Soviet statues are a different story, they were an aggressor that ruined and occupied the country
Sorry, if I came off as a bit assertive, I did not mean to
Also what you ask is true, but it's also common to graffiti other statues by drunk teenagers who want to be edgy
Budapesti here, for the record for me it is not about whether it is the capital or not, but about whether it is a remotely cosmopolitan big city or not
I don't think vidék is used for people looked down upon or people who live anywhere but the capital city, most people in my town use the word for people that don't live in our town, so if you live in Debrecen you would still call people from Budapest a "Vidéki"
Debrecen is looked down because it's a shithole with peasants
There are actual cities in Hungary with real citizens (with the attitude of one) like Szeged, Pécs, even Győr or Sopron, Szombathely
Debrecen is just a pumped up village
I have to add that in "vidék" people rom the capital are looked down
For the "i know everything better" attitude, despite often having no achievment other than being born in the capital
I think it has different levels
Looking from Budapest, everything is vidék. From the county towns, all the smaller towns and villages are vidék. From the smaller towns, villages are vidék. It doesn't matter how far you are in vidék, there'll always be somewhere more vidéki than where you are
In my experience, in Budapest "vidék" means everywhere outside of Budapest, while here in Miskolc it usually means smaller towns or villages
Especially villages
Someone from Budapest/Debrecen/Győr isn't a vidéki here but someone from idk, Mezőkövesd might be
To be fair, some people are just judgemental assholes and love that "bunkó pesti" stereotype even if they've never actually met someone from Budapest, lol
And of course both people born in the capital and also those in the "vidék" tend to forget that many people living in Budapest are actually vidéki
So is that what that band is named after
I'm a big fan of a band that used to make a lot of covers earlier and found out that one of their songs was a cover of a song by said Irish band, but with different lyrics
Yes it was
I wonder why there, out of all places
Im from Hungary, and when i was about 10 years old I went to the Czech Republic with my class
And what do 10 years old kids do when they visit a county with a different native language
Obviously swearing in Hungarian, thinking nobody would understand
Back then we didnt know that "kurva" means exatly the same in Czech
My sister is a flight attendant and she's often put on flights to Romania since she speaks the language fluently
One time there were a couple of guys on the plane talking loudly in Romanian, making sexual comments about all the flight attendants, and what they would do with them
My sister then turned towards them, and in perfect Romanian asked them if they were ashamed of themselves
The guys turned red and stayed silent the whole trip
A couple of weeks ago I saw a map that showed the European languages that use the word
Here is the map that depicts the "Kurwa Empire": [Link]
Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, and Czechia used to be one country, so the languages had an influence on one another
For example, in Hungarian, we have lots of words that have a Slavic origin
The Hungarian language is unique and the people here are more or less proud of it, however, speaking a language that is a part of a big language family has some benefits
When I went to Italy earlier this year to Firenze, I felt basically embarrassed by how badly I dressed compared to all the people around me
Like holy shit it felt like I'm walking amongst models
As an example: we once visited the water park in Lutzmannsburg, Austria, and just walked across the border to Zsira, Hungary for dinner, then back to the hotel in Austria
No border checks, we took photos with the border signs
Germany here
I am living 20 kilometres to the Austrian border
Gas is much cheaper there so I always drive over to fill up
Cigarettes are like €1 cheaper if I'm out I buy a box
inside the schengen zone (EU, CH, NOR), you do not need a passport, an ID card is enough
Although nobody asks for it in normal circumstances
Very rarely there are some police cars at the border, and I am dealing with cars so I'm often driving with a dealers plate
They  like to stop me because of that
Once I took a friend of mine with me, and he forgot his ID
We had a control on the way back from German police officers, and my friend got citation for €25 but he was let into Germany
I have a few friends who are from Turkey, and if they are crossing the border they have to have the Turkish passport as well their German confirmation of residence on them
I was born in Hungary and I have a Hungarian ID
I often sell cars in Hungary, and sometimes I like to drive it myself over there and have a little "vacation".
After the lockdown has been eased (start of may maybe, don't remember well) there was a lot of police cars in the Austrian border, but I didn't see them stop anybody
On the hungarian austrian Border there was a huge police checkpoint and they stopped everybody
They asked if I was going for business or pleasure, if it would have been pleasure and I'm a Hungarian resident I would have gotten a two weeks quarantine enforced by police officers who would check up on me nearly every day at random times even middle of the night
Because it was business and I had the paperwork to prove it I could just drive over no quarantine no nothing (like I can't have the virus because I'm going to business trip)
If if I would have just driven through Hungary to reach other countries then I would have gotten a red sticker on my car saying Transit
Then I wouldn't be allowed to stop anywhere accept on gas station and parking lots which say Transit on them (and if I don't have the red sticker I am not allowed to stop on those stations)
###I steered away from the original question but **tldr** you only need an ID card and you can go anywhere no questions asked (mind you there is no pandemic going on in an ideal circumstance)
A lots of people in the western part (e.g. Sopron) works in Austria but lives in Hungary
So they go to a different country in daily basis
> Several years ago I crossed from Austria to Hungary several times in just a few days
My passport was checked by the Hungarians
That had to be before 2008 then
I drove in Paris a couple of times around Arc de Triomphe included
I didn't have any issues as I got my driving experience in Budapest where road rage is pretty much standard
"Huncut" which means "playfully mischievous", comes from the German word "hundsfutt" meaning "dog's vagina".
The word "minta" (sample or example) comes from Sami
A 18th Hungarian scholar thought that is an old Uralic word, related to Hungarian "mint a" (such as), so he introduced it into Hungarian vocabulary and it caught on
In fact the Sami word comes from Norwegian "mynte" (coin) which in turn comes from Latin and not at all an original Uralic word
It's probably the most random and unexpected etymology in Hungarian
A Latin word that reached Hungarian through Sami
"Vigéc" is a very old-fashioned word for travelling salesmen
It comes from German "Wie geht’s Ihnen
" (How are you
), because that is how Austrian travelling salesmen introduced themselves back in the 19th century
And to Hungarian it comes from Ottoman Turkish via Serbo-Croatian
One we use often that I know of is “muszáj” which comes from the German “es muss sein” basically meaning it is a must; it has to be
A huncut nem onnan ered
A “csirkefogó”, “gazember” jelentésváltozást, ami még a németben ment végbe kihagytam, igaz
[De végső soron a leírt eredet stimmel]
In Hungary it's probably German
There are people who learn/used to learn it as a foreign language instead of English and even more people who studied both
I think it's German, because a lot of Hungarians work in  Austria and Germany
Well pretty sure it’s German, because a lot of people go to work in either Germany or Austria (they pay them better there)
I can’t think of a second most spoken language other than English, but it doesn’t count
Actually more people speak and better in German than in English here
But it is very popular as a 2nd foreign language so probably a lot more people speak it than 1%.
They sure were
No more puns at least haha
I was about to say that most young people are quite computer literate, but after reading this thread I'm losing confidence lol
Maybe my perspective is just not representative, but in my school every kid in class was doing PowerPoint or Prezi presentations at 12/13 years old
In high school we used to prank teachers by writing short BAT file, putting it on the desktop of the classroom computer and disguising it as the Firefox shortcut, so it does something funny when clicked (shuts down the PC for example)
the ol' switcheroo, mi is ilyenekkel próbálkozotunk
I think it depends on what field you work
I would expect someome working in a office to know those "skills" you mentioned
Someone who works in construction, maybe not
Yeah, all the names that have English equivalents are like this
:D I mean the English equivalent of Miklós is Michael (not pronounced the same) or maybe that was not the question
Idk
I think you mean Miklós = Nicholas, since Michael = Mihály
Yeah, sorry
One of the few places in Europe thats still relatively untouched
the primal, natural feeling there is pretty cool
I mean you can get lost up in the Zemplén.
I'm not sure what you mean by the question
Is he/she born abroad but still a Hungarian citizen at birth because his/her parents are Hungarian
That wouldn't be controversial at all
Is he/she born abroad AND his/her parents aren't Hungarian so he/she is a naturalized citizen
Some right-wing voters would probably be upset, especially if the naturalization process happened later in life
I was always surprises, wow that french man has a really hungarian looking name
Now i see that im just dumb
Its also a bit funny that his name means something along the lines “between mud” by spelling Sárközy
In Hungary [Index] and [444
hu] are the two largest newspapers that are not state run (yet)
To be fair though, it's not like they fear them, our current government can do whatever they want at this point
Even if these papers would report on every single heinous crime they commit all day long (which they tried to do in the past, but they just couldn't keep up) will not change the fact that the current ruling party made it so that they cannot be beaten in a normal fair election
So they're just mildly annoyed by them
Our newspapers fear the government lol
There is one webpage in Hungary, called Átlátszó, and they are trying to make transparent the goverment work, mostly the financial part
Remember that one time when the government set internationally wanted fugitive Nikola Gruevski up with a safehouse that was literally next door to 444
hu's offices
That's how little they care about their wrongdoings being reported in the media
Their voters live in a goverment owned media bubble, they only ever hear how perfect everything is
They don't even put in the work to find scapegoats any more
But yeah he is one of the classics
Mostly
They don't even put in the effort for their propaganda bs
One example from this week
A Führerbefehl was given last week that all the not life-threatened patients have to be sent home from the hospitals, so there will be beds for corona-patients
There are many stories that also those kinds of patients are sent away who need 0-24 medical supervision which isn't expected from untrained relatives who need to work, btw
One of the hospitals didn't do this quickly enough - so the hospital director was fired on the spot
All the doctors and nurses protested for him, everybody said he was a very good director and doctor, it created a huge uproar
The government didn't care
And today, the government media found unmasked the conspiracy: one of the NGOs who protested, is partially financed by Soros
Conclusion told in the media: everybody who says it might not have been the best decision to fire that director, is the slave of Soros
Sometimes, a "war" brings out the good from the people in the meaning of holding together
Unfortunately, the corona crisis has brought out the very worst from Orbán.
Aaaahhh you murdered this joke
More like Russia or Turkey, since we're at least nominally a democracy
Also the freedom of press has only been limited through financial means rather than outright force
At least so far
Not only that, that motherf
has been on an authoritarian luck streak ever since he got into power
He won the elections AFTER the 2008 financial crisis hit
Ever since, he has been riding the uptick of the global economy that he could sell as his and his party's own success
Then the migrant crisis hit, that he could and has been milking for years now
and now this
Every time his approval rating starts to dip significantly a new crisis hits that he can blame on the "Crumbling West" / Migrants / Soros / Brussels / or insert random conspiracy theory
Take your pick
Sometimes it's all of these in one
And since all the media is now owned by him and his crooks, he can put any spin on any story they want
Nothing short of a miracle I'm afraid
The opposition did defeat his party in the mayoral elections last autumn, but the stakes are far higher in a national election, and Orbán has a LOT to lose
He'll do pretty much anything to stay in power
I'm really not sure
Putting maximum political pressure on him and cutting EU funding could work, but it could also help him turn public opinion against the EU
Also, the latter would not happen anyway, as Poland would veto it
Cut EU funds and put pressure on the govenment
I think its fair to say: Poland
It all started when we formed a personalunion( both of us had the same king)
Also as I know we were the only ones helping the polish in the Polish-Soviet War of 1920
Later we refused to attack Poland in 1939 and we didnt let the germans attack from our terrority
The poles inspired our revolution of 1956 and they donated a lot too
In conclusion Poland and Hungary are brothers
With a series of dynastic marriages (Queen Kinga and Jadwiga were from Hungary), and the occasional personal union with either Hungary (Louis and Wladyslaw of Varna) or the Principality of Transylvania (Stefan Báthory)
Medieval Hungary and Poland rarely having any conflicting interests helped a lot, probably
Military assistance was often provided (from coordinated efforts against Mongol incursions to Jan Sobieski, Józef Bem and some well-needed Hungarian supplies for the Polish-Soviet war)
Not only Hungary refused to attack Poland (or even allow Germany access via Hungary) in 1939, but Hungarian troops under German command refused to participate in crushing the Warsaw uprising and provided what assistance they could to Poles (Hungarian uniforms, medical supplies, escape routes for civilians and active fighters, especially from and around district Mokotów)
Poles reciprocated the assistance by donating substantial amounts of blood and medical supplies during the 1956 revolution ([ [
Hungary used to be a safe haven (or a transitory) for Polish émigrés and refugees after the partitions and during WW2), too
It started with them:
It started around 1000, during the reign of the Árpád and Piast dynasties
Here's an article in [Hungarian] and in [Polish] The [English] one is very incomplete
This friendship is more important than a silly world war
It's insane how we know what to do when the occasion rises
I've read about resistance fighters escaping among the Hungarian troops themselves and an alleged single instance of a firefight between Hungarian and German troops
&#x200B;
Too bad that switching sides was not a realistic option, given the horrible circumstances
&#x200B;
Edit: [
A dream team
Ostmark
Polish assistance provided spontaneously for the 1956 revolution is rather chilling
In mere days, supplies worth 2 million dollars were delivered to Hungary
That would amount near 19 million in today's money, from a country devastated by the war eleven years prior
The rallies in Hungary that sparked the revolution were partly motivated by Polish events
Here's a Polish eagle among the banners, accompanied with a call for solidarity with the Polish nation:
Südost-Bayern
Yes, a LOT of people
Thank you, came here to comment that
You were faster
Aside from the usual self-depricating jokes, most of gen z loves to make fun of the very nationalistoc Hungarian attitude
Some people tend to think that everything and everyone important in history can be traced back to Hungary and we are the center of the universe
We, teens find that very funny
We have a phrase: “Sírva vigad a magyar” which meant we are crying even when we have fun
Most pessimistic humor you can imagine .
About 20% gyipsies, 15% politics, 35% Scots, 10% poltics and 20% wife bad
Sarcasm, self-deprecation, and sadly, a lot of antisemitism and racism
Basically just fuck everyone and make fun that they can't say word properly or a Hungarian not understanding other languages
There's a joke about that
Which are the three shortest books
Hungarian military victories after 1490
American culture
The thousand years of German humour
I think in Eastern Europe, we have a great heritage about making up and understanding some quality political jokes, even in the middle of conversation
In socialist era the bittersweet sarcasm and semi-safe puns were quite like a coping mechanism with the system, and it taught us to read between lines and catch deep-hidden meanings
And to be pretty honest, most of our contries' political system are a joke ever since, so there was no point in spoiling these great strength of ours
Or the "Bozgors" being stupid
But let me show you the other way around
In the morning, in the barracks of the Romanian Army, the following dialgoues are heard:
"Adrian
"Yes, sir
"You go with the lorry and bring supplies from the warehouse
"Yes, sir, understood
"Ovidiu
"Yes, sir
"You go to the watchtower, and check the reflectors
"Yes, sir, understood
"Ábel
"Yes, sir
"You go and clean all the lavatories with a toothbrush
"Yes, sir, expected
The political system here is so bad the actual joke party(mkkp) would be the best
I don't know that particular sub, but I do like German humour
I liked Stefan Raab or Freitagnachtnews (long time ago) or even Bullyparade
Well the closest thing we had was the "Öszöd speech" - an speech during the conference for the members of the then governing hungarian socialist party
That got leaked and made the party implode
(sadly there is no youtube video with subtitles, enjoy excerpts on the wiki)
Btw
this speech is in large part to blame whrre we are at today
Its when right wing media and FIDESZ started up on populism, to capitalize on this blunder of epic proportion
And due to success havent stopped since
(Before this FIDESZ used to be "thd intellectuals party", now its conspiracy theorist heaven)
That Romania doesn't exist
Yeaah, Trianon hit hard

This is bullshit, nobody says that
A "very funny" running joke is to say "I'm older than Slovakia".
oh god oh fuck
Yeah
Romanian's hairy feet is the weirdest piece of racism I've ever seen/heard of

Here in Debrecen it is a very common saying
I have no idea

I’m trying to not be interested in my own country’s politics
Sigh
I'm actually more interested in foreign politics
Mostly the UK and Germany, and when it comes to that any country that has a big influence on the EU like France, Italy or the Netherlands
In Hungary it is absolutely normal especially is non-urbanized regions

Fucking lovely in here
Fidesz-KDNP combo, because they are one party at this point
Two Tailed Dog Party, a joke party but it's the real opposition
And the rest, welfare parties, not really doing anything, at all
Which one is the Tsar's party
Absolute dictatorship, disaster, no free speech, opression
wait the mayor of Budapest is liberal, take that back
Thanks, TIL
Not exactly the same, but the closest in my opinion „legyen“ (let it be), it’s usually said when annoyed
Like when your friend wants to go that pub, you want to go to this pub, but you say „I’ll let it be“ instead of arguing about it
Well, pretty much only one, and that isn't really it either
The word is "Legyen", which means like "fine" or "okay", but people rarely use it in this context
I can't think of any other right now
This is very similar to our Hungarian na jó
In Hungarian we have "na jó", and "jó" means good in Hungarian, so we basically say the same
Depending on context, I think "jogos" is the closest to fair enough
Mostly during debates, when one side brings up a good (counter-)argument, "jogos" is used in the same way as fair enough
I’d rather say “hát jó” but it really depends on the intonation
You can either approve something positively or agree with something you would disagree with otherwise
Yeah, "hát jó" ("well, ok") can seem passive-agressive
"Fair enough" is more positive and kind of agreeing
I would say "végülis ja" would have the same sentiment, or "abban is van valami" or "aha, van benne valami".
Or a bit archaically "ám legyen"
Ebben is van valami

And our surnames also have to be chosen from a pre determined list, but the list is huge so you can find all names that are not like Elon's Son's name
In Hungary the struckture of the names is different: 1
Name Family name given by the father surname + 2
Name Your given name (Parents have to choose from a list) + 3
Name sometimes a second name (Works like a middle name)
Father's surname + given name (+optional given name)
Edit: others usually ask you if you have two given names which do one you use, and refer to you accordingly
Birth names:
Family name (may be double-barrelled) + at most 2 given names
In this order
Married names:
Men can
* keep their own name
* use a double-barrelled family name
* or take the partner's family name while keeping the given name
Women also have the above options, as well as
* adding the husband's family name + -né to the front of their names
* adding the husband's full name + -né in front of their names
* replacing their family name with husband's family name
* replacing their full name with husband's full name + -né
Here's a Wikipedia article that explains this better:
Hungary is unique in this:
Father's family name + given name + (given name but its optional)
In Hungary we've got our surnames first and then "first" names
It's pretty logical if you think of lists of names in alphabetical order, so you won't have all Abraham's first
Greater group first and then smaller, same applies to addresses in .hu btw
As of quantities some have double surnames, as they get married they take their spouses name as well or some use their mum's maiden name as well, but some have two first names too
I think both phenomena get more popular these days
Given names can only get picked from an officially approved list which very slowly extends over time
I like this sort of conservatism so too funky names don't occur
Isn't family name = surname
I think you were thinking about "given name"
I don't know what most of my ancestors did around 1819
I can trace only one branch of our family tree back that far in the past, on that side pretty much everyone belonged to petty noble families and were landowners in Northeastern Hungary
So I guess I'd be the same with a tiny chance of being a soldier, teacher or working for the local government
My ancestors lived further north, in the border of Borsod and Gömör/Gemer counties (mostly in Slovakia nowadays) so most likely I would be a peasant, or maybe a miner, or a foundryman
I would be a very poor peasant
The freedom of serfs did not come until 1853 in Hungary
Well not "Austro-Hungarian" strictly speaking
The dual monarchy was established in the [1867 compromise]

Fortunately, you can't die twice
This thing is only working when you have born in a rich family
It is of course important to consider the financial consequences it might bear on my country if we were to “upset” China, as losing out on trade completely would not be something my country could afford in my opinion
On the other hand, morally, I would absolutely be in support of us cooperating with Taiwan, even though I am not completely aware of how exactly it could be beneficial to both parties because of my lack of knowledge about the taiwanese industry, but if it were to be of benefit, I would 100% support it
Given of course that even if we lose China as a partner, the alternatives we find are not too bad
Same in Hungary
Same in Hungary
we have Saint Nicholas on the 6th of Dec tho
Seemingly everyone who's been to Budapest, upon finding out you live there, insists on asking if you live in Buda or Pest
I think it's some sort of 'look at me, I learned there's two parts
' but it's about as useful a distinction of asking someone if they're from North or South of the Thames in London
A lot of tourists Say Bukarest in Budapest and probably Budapest in Bukarest
At least know what city you are in
It is not impossible
From Bulgaria
Maybe they hoped for a "yes", because they do eat dogs
Btw, it gives another meaning to the infamous Hungarian war slogan from WW1: "Quit, dog Serbia
" (sorry about that)
>15
That Ireland uses pound sterling
>17
That the toll machines take pound sterling (happens all the fucking time)
That's something I can understand
We had a five-day class trip to Ireland, and we crossed into Northern Ireland for a day
I completely forgot about it and tried to pay in euros, after that in obsolete pound notes
I was in Berlin once, and visited a genuine Italian restaurant late at night (near to the Potsdamer Platz)
The menu, the whole atmosphere very Italian, the waiters themselves looked very Italian, too
So, very authentic
I ate tagliatelle al ragú, and it was heavenly, not like the socalled "bolognese spagetthi".
Anyway, a stereotypical American couple (like both 90 years old, very colourful shirts, baseball caps etc) was sitting at a nearby table
When the waiter was taking their orders, I overheard him answering to their question with a poker face: "No, we don't have pizza with pineapple
" I almost loled
But the Swedes do hate you, though, right
We need more leaders like Atatürk
I don't know how it's abroad, but in Hungary it means "give me your cheapest wine". So this is what I do everywhere, too
My previous bank using Internet Explorer 8 and Windows XP
Floppy disks in 2019
On the other hand Austria created a solar power plant by shutting down a nuclear one and plumping some solar panels on top of it
Pure genius
My dentist has a windows xp pc
Various cities, until spring of 2018, had to use Win 95 based Ddos program with floppy disk in the taxation section
The whole system was a shitshow ( the current isn't better either) data losses because of the negligence from the Kincstár, the program couldn't handle various situations which led to unnecessary bills to the citizens
The new ("""new""") program didn't worked for a year and we were forced to use the old parallel with the new
Every data had to be relocated by hand

My problem is not with outdated technologies but with IE8's security issues
Not exactly a word, but the lack of formal language can be a bit annoying
inte för mycket och inte för lite
There are not many European languages that use honorifics like the Japanese do
There might be none, actually
Sure, but when one translates from another language to English, a lot of nuance can be lost because of this

[Nyugati Station overpass in Budapest]
This bridge lost its purpose and they are gonna demolish it fortunately, but I wanted to say an example that is not only ugly, but purposeless, since the buildings people share are just subjectively ugly, since I like a lot of them
That doesn't mean there aren't very ugly buildings here, like [this one] I think my tolerance is higher
I think social realism left well-recognizable landmarks in Eastern European countries, maybe every larger settlement could provide horrible constructions in this thread
My favourite is this community center from my hometown, Nyíregyháza
Hint: it's supposed to look like a bridge
[Before] and [after] renovation
Some think it didn't help at all
I deeply agree with them, it should've been torn down
In my childhood there was a rumour that it made into an "ugliest building in the world" contest, but I couldn't find any source
Anyway, it shows perfectly how locals feel about this monster in the city centre
I worked at McDonalds's. Someone asked for a beer
I was surprised how can somebody ask a beer her, bit I later learned that McDonald's actually sell beer in other countries
ok you won this
in my school religions are only mentioned in history classes and we only learn the basics of a religion and what people actually believe in
I also had religious lessons but I didn't mind
I've always thought that christianity is an important thing in the European culture because of its influence for decades
Having a basic knowledge about christianity and the Bible is the same cultural minimum as about your country's literature and history
Although I can see that its quality deeply depends on the system and the teacher
I've heard stories about how extremely religious teachers tried to turn the students' whole view of the world and force dogmatic moral principles on them (especially Roman Catholic teachers)
I think a few classes don't harm but there should be a regulation to avoid proselytization
I would've loved this in high school
Hell i'd still love it as an online course or something
Religions are fascinating and tell us so much about human nature and history
That being said my religion class was about loving Jesus, singing and not drawing birds on top of churches
it was not compulsory to attend at least
I think I'd choose either Esztergom, or Székesfehérvár.
Historically, these cities are both much more important than Budapest
Székesfehérvár was the centre of the Kingdom at the time of Saint Stephen I, and it was the coronation city
And Esztergom was the centre of the Archbishops of the Kingdom
&#x200B;
I guess some people would also say Debrecen, since it's the 2nd largest city after Budapest, but in my opinion, it's too far East, while Budapest is in the centre/Northern region
And Székesfehérvár and Esztergom are both really close to Budapest
>Overall I support Berlin by today but if I had to choose in 1949 I'd definetely say Frankfurt>Bonn
As far as I know, that's exactly why they chose Bonn
The plan was always reunification with Berlin as the capital, Bonn was always meant to be temporary
Putting the capital in Frankfurt would have been seen as a more permanent solution
I mean they can't even get Budapest right
Remember people, it's Budapesht
Btw Székesfehérvár means Chair White Castle
Stuhlweißenburg in German
Nah, if I had to choose from a former Hungarian city, I'd definitely choose Cluj
That would lead to problems with the hungarians
It's neither of those
It wasn't a capital, and it's not really central to the old borders, it's just my own bias, as I like Transylvania more than Slovakia
And it's the largest city in Transylvania
(And it's kinda central to Transylvania)
True dat

the amount of EU money FIDESZ makes up all kinds of lies about makes us pretty important but in a bad way, I think, besides, we're about to cross the line to dictatorship if they stay in power in 2022, we either get sanctioned or kicked out of EU if they finally realise
Not the country, only the PM
We've been taken hostage on this ride, and I don't see a way out yet
The election system got distorted, the opposition is flaccid, and the governing party has its tentacles in everything
You as germans should know that something like this is not only possible, it's scarily easy to achieve if the populace is not self-aware, educated and is not fed propaganda instead of real news
I'm not trying to whitewash Hungary, I'm well aware of how problematic we are right now to the EU, but please know that what Orbán does is no way what we think is right, it's byzantian power games and blackmail to get his way
And we live that every day
Under current circumstances, that's not so easy
You see, back when the left was in government, they did a shit job too
So much so, that people went and voted on a protest basis back in 2010
Orbán was nowhere the authoritarian back then as he is today, he appeared as a charismatic and competent figure who could bring order into that shitshow
He had a lot of help from Arthur Finkelstein, and that set his campaign (and his political direction) on a course mwe see today
He won a political majority, and he could basically govern alone without any discussion, which he used to quickly re-write the constitution, the voting process and weaken the rules of the democratic checks and balances so that every decision can, and would be tipped in his favor
We are a cautionary tale for the rest of the world: in a few years, even the strongest democracies can be eroded to the point where we are now
Yes
In my country Healthcare is free but it's shit (interpret free as 18
5% of your income)
My uncle with stroke was literally sent home because they said they can't treat him
Sucks
&#x200B;
But this'll get lost in the sea of comments from Scandinavian people saying it's awesome and everyone should have it and it's a human right and bla bla bla
It's not really free as others have said
A big big downside is that since the government is controlling it, it means that they can decide how much money goes into it
So, if they're not investing into healthcare, you're getting horrible service, unhappy nurses and doctors and patients
Yes, the funding of the health care system is not done well, most of the buildings are old, doctors can't work well in that environment
Just a few months ago the government changed the new contract healthcare workers had to sign, and thousands left because of that (in the middle of a fucking pandemic, so you can guess how generous the new contract was)
bottom text
In addition to not counting the uninsured or people who can't afford treatment, they're often comparing our public healthcare to the US private system
Most - actually I presume all - European countries also have private clinics and hospitals where you can go if you aren't happy with the public system and, of course, if you have enough money
The difference is if you don't have money, you might wait a bit in the public system
Without a public system, you would wait indefinitely
Oh, and lots of doctors and dentists in private clinics also list prices on their website, so you can compare
I think the very existence of a public system helps keep private prices low
Lots of people go to private dentists or specialist doctors for less expensive things, but if it's cancer or something, thank goodness for the public system
I don't understand how the Dutch still have throats

That's mainly because we aren't real

It's more of a 'w' sound
Nicolae Ceausescu is wrong
We really appreciate the attempt
Lengyel, magyar, két jó barát.
Did the polish run out of vowels in some point or do you just write like that for shits and giggles
We are aware of the confusion, so we always say our names in a western name order to foreigners
Which can cause double trouble if they know our tradition and call us our first name in a formal setting - it doesn't help that most of our first names of international origin (like Latin, Greek or Hebrew etc
) are almost always spellt a little bit differently
Like John = János or Thomas = Tamás etc
I work abroad
If I got a euro every time they mistake my surname with my first name I would be a millionaire
Also they never know if I'm male or female
I'm talking about emails of course
magyar, köszönöm, szia, jó napot, nem
Hungarian, thank you, hi, good day, no
As far as I know Lengyel comes from Old Russian "Lendo" but I have no idea what it means
We use lines to indicate a long vowel
E is like the first in ever, while é is like the first vowel in cane
A is like in car, while á is like in bye
The whole batch is: á, é, í, ó, ö, ő, ú, ü, ű
> Also they never know if I'm male or female
Yes
This is also very typical
The name Zsolt is variation of Zoltán which can be derived from the Turkish word for sultan (king)

Decolonisation
Although not physically in Europe, I think this counts as European history
I don't know too much about how the colonial powers lost/gave up all their colonies
Hungarian USSR & Romanian invasion of hungary between WWI & WWII - i guess its used to be politically inconvenient (to the narrative of big evil hungary), then completely obscure
I would certainly want to know more about the time between the fall of the Roman Empire and Charlemagne
We haven't really learned about it
Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived
His reign was basically
He struggled to get a male heir, and the reason he separated England from the Catholic church is because he wanted a divorce
He also had a jousting accident later on in life, so he became a fatass
Also, Yugoslav Wars in general
It is at the end of the history books, so usually, there is no time to talk about it in school
The YT channel John D Ruddy has some amazing videos about 20th century Irish history, like the independence war, Bloody Sunday, the civil war, The Troubles, Good Friday Agreement, etc
We are very bad at enjoying ourselves, most of our holidays are just days of mourning
March 15
: Failed revoution
October 23
: Failed revolution + loads of kids dead
Halloween = 'Mindenszentek napja' (All Saints' Day): We go to the cemetery, take care of the graves and mourn
We do celebrate on 20th August (Foundation Day)
Actually on March 15
we celebrate a successful revolution because the revolution was successful
The war of independence failed that followed the revolution and that's way it's a bittersweet celebration
Fair enough
Hungary's anthem says: "Megbűnhődte már e nép a múltat s jövendőt!" = 'They who suffered for all sins of the past and of the future'
Also it talks a lot about the glories of Hungarians just to top it off with how when we fucked something up we got punished for it 10x over
Last verse:
"Pity, God, the Magyar, then,
Long by waves of danger tossed;
Help him by Thy strong hand when
He on grief's sea may be lost
Fate, who for so long did'st frown,
Bring him happy times and ways;
Atoning sorrow hath weighed down
All the sins of all his days
...Very cheerful lyrics
Well Mindenszentek is on November 1st, and Halloween is just non-existant
Thus All Saints' Day is taken a bit more seriously than in other countries
(And because of the closeness of these two dates it's sometimes called a "Hungarian halloween".)
Yeah, fair enough
Now that I think of it even after the war we got more freedom, so I guess that's good
A mighty foe indeed
I didn't even talk about our Szózat (Secondary anthem)
A parts of the official lyrical translation:
"Oh, Magyar, keep immovably
your native country's trust,
for it has borne you, and at death
will consecrate your dust
&#x200B;
"To you, O nations of the world,
we call with passioned breath:
"Should not a thousand years of pain
bring liberty—or death
&#x200B;
"Or there shall come, if come there must,
a death of fortitude;
and round about our graves shall stand
a nation washed in blood
&#x200B;
Around the graves where we shall die
a weeping world will come,
and millions will in pity gaze
upon the martyrs' tomb
Well Happy St
George's day to you too
And I will also look up you guys, because you seem to have an interesting history
: As I was searching up the Szózat english lyrics I remembered this old revolutinary song (similar tone): [Have fun ;)]
On the 24th mostly
We exchange gifts/put them under the tree for the kids at the evening
A lot go to church this day, but my family for example goes on the 25th
24th December
We decorate the tree in the morning and presents are handed in the evening
it differs from family to family
on 24th evening: close family dinner and presents
25th, family on my mother's side, 26th is family on my father's side
then the rest is random people we know, friends and just rest

Nem, 23-a nem fontos ünnepnap, kivéve persze ha vasárnapra esik
Amúgy nagyon jól tudsz magyarul, legalábbis ez alapján az egy mondat alapján :D.

Also the color of shorts is white, its not khaki pants, or jeans
Budapest for sure, it's like there are more tourists every year
Lake Balaton also used to be frequented by foreigners but has become a sort of poor man's beach holiday lately
I think Budapest and the lake Balaton are the most touristy
The Centre of Budapest, and the cities around the Balaton
Lot's of people visit these 2 things in Hungary and call it a day, which is sad, because we have a shitton of castles and ruins scattered all around the North Hungarian mountains
[It’s Lake Balaton]
I just realized that even though I have been to Romania like 6 times, for several days each time, I've never visited anything outside of Transylvania
I've been to Skiathos and the Meteora monasteries
Idk, I was just there and the campsite was full of foreigners, even in the pandemic so they're definitely still there
It was poor man's beach resort for a while, but now it's becoming the private swimming pool of the Orbán family & friends
That's odd to hear, I had friends visit from the UK, and you can get flights from a lot of places, well, maybe not now, but I know people flew here from London, Leeds, Glasgow and Edinburgh
I myself fly to Glasgow and back very frequently too
Well, among the people I know, it kinda is, but it's not like what Mecca is for the Muslims
But when someone does go to Romania, there is a 100% chance they're going to Transylvania, and an additional 99% chance that they go to Székelyföld
I mean I spent the majority of my time in cities like Targu Mureş, Gheorgheni, Sfântu Gheorghe, Odorheiu Secuiesc etc
you know it
But even I don't know why I don't try out other places, I've heard lots of things about Bucharest, Constanţa etc
Also, when we go to these cities, we never say "We go to Romania", but it's an unwritten rule that we must say "We go to Transylvania
" :'D
Will do if/when this corona stuff ends
I would say east of budapest since budapest gets recommended a lot and is east of czechia
>I wonder, does the Transylvanian Hungarian dialect differ much from the Hungarian spoken in Hungary
Are there any linguistic differences
There are some words that are unique to them, and they have a what we in Hungarian call "tájszólás", which is a kind of an accent/dialect
But it's a rather mild difference between the 2, so with some extra effort, you can understand them
The same goes for Southern Slovakian Hungarians, although the difference is even smaller there
I don't know anything about the Vojvodinan dialect, because I have never met anyone from there, but I think it's the same thing with their words
That's the thing in Hungarian, differences in the language usually come through in the different regional words, rather then pronunciation
I'm not saying that there aren't any differences in pronunciation, because there are, the most famous one being the Szeged dialect (instead of Es, they say Ös), but it's mainly the words
E.g. I live in the North East, and we have some words that are uniquely North-Eastern;
Wheelbarrow - Talicska, but we say Furik
Sunflower seeds: - Szotyi, but we say Makuka
Hood (like on the hoodies) - Kapucni (of Slavic origin), but we say Süsü
Fun fact: Süsü is also a well known Hungarian children's tale
"Süsü a sárkány" (Süsü the dragon)
>b) visiting areas that have a significant percentage of Hungarian speakers probably feels a lot closer to home than visiting, say, Bucharest
Yeah, that's definitely true, it was a really good feeling to be able go completely get by with my native language in another country, because obviously as a Hungarian that's not something I experience every day
If you mention the name of a state most people will likely know that it's "somewhere in the US" because they heard the name in a movie before
But being able to list all states, letalone point them out on a map
Maybe one in a million
*Maybe* they'll know where California, Florida, and Texas are but that's it
Rest are complete mystery
Ofc, even my grandma knows Florida is the biggest city in California
Well most people recognize state names, i wouldnt say that qualifies as fairly well
r/askanamerican
(Ofc
You can find the equivalent of "what in tarnation of cousin fuckin alabama shit is this
" places of poverty and general misery, and people there wont have much clue - but the same people wont have much clue about a lot of other things either, including current president, form of state - no we dont live in communism, since 3 decades ...etc)
Well, I could name the more famous states on a blind map, but I'm having troubles with their capitals though
I know that it's usually not the most well known city, so it's confusing
What I do know, is that Phoenix is the capital of Arizona, and Tallahassee is Florida's.
On a map, I could locate California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida, Utah, Nevada, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Wisconsin Michigan, Indiana and Minnesota
I can name about 60-70% of them, maybe even roughly put them on the map and talk about it a bit I guess but thats about it
You give too much credit to the average bloke
As the average includes senile old farts who believe aggricukturee is most efficient when done by hand and isnt mechanized, and that we need back franco to bring back virtue in the country and reform the decadent yiuth
...though the capital thjng is skmewhat reasonable, since there are no shortage of places with the "biggest city cant be the capital, that would be opression" similar to asustrakia, all of which ended uphaving a  relatively insignificant place for capital
Florida man is world famous
(yes, thats asignificant part of the reason)
I would say most people would recognize that "its a place in the US" if they hear the name, they could only show it on the map, know some trivia about, or name it off the top of head for relatively few states
Well there are two types of where areyou from
(sadly it delends on context)
...one is inquiring about the location you originate froom
...the other is intrested only in what cultural background do you have - and the US has a lot in common
Imo thats a bit different but I kinda feel like especially here on reddit that everyone just assumes you are American, hence the no shit part
Well germany is prettymuch the only true federal state in europe - that was created by union of places that had som estatehood beforehand
Nope Italy, you were such a political clustrefuck, with borders migrating on a weekly basis that wedeny you your right to call yourself federal
Ok i simply wanted to ilkustrated idiocy, with my countrys most politically powerful brand of idiot - the old fart that idolizes the interwar period, and wants to bring it back
I am pretty cobfident that the existence of morons who dont have much connection to reality is not a phenomenon unique to my country

People are people everywhere
It sucks MORE than minneapolis
Just reading the wikipedia entry on minneapolis police department makes me wanna avoid the place - and not everything made it to wiki, just high profile stuff with convictions - so the PD effectively running a drug distribution operation wont be on the wiki, nor the fac that main witness mysteriously suicided himself in the day before he was to testify
...does the other city 1 up minneapolis really
What is a phrase in your language which has a completely different meaning when you change the word order
In Hungarian, there's a funny one:
Neked áll feljebb = you are more upset
Neked feljebb áll = your boner is bigger
I unfortunately made this mistake while arguing with my father and we both bursted in uncontrollable laughter
Literally any phrase
Yeah, comas are a pretty big deal
Hungarian
It has random weird grammatical rules
It's fun
We're the people no one invited but we joined anyways
Maybe you're thinking about the Samoyedic languages, which (if my memory serves me right) is a branch of the Uralic languages, just like Finno-Ugric is
Yeah, travelling's easier
It's literally keep us alive, although the f-in government steals a butt ton of money
Hell yeah dude
Yes
No shitty healthare costs only shitty healthcare
Hell yes, i think i am very lucky to be an eu citizen
It is give us lots of rights and possibilities and compared to other countries in the world it is safe to live here also
György Soros is literally conspiring against the sacred government
Why
Because he's evil
And millions of people actually believe this
EDIT: but you have to see, he doesn't just care about the big picture, according to the government, he's micromanaging the conspiration
For example, the newest issue that he _personally_ persuaded Romani people in a very poor village that they should sue the local government because of school segregation
Now that they have won the lawsuit, the government launched an anti-Romani campaign against them telling that the only reason they sued is because György Soros persuaded them so the Hungarian Government could be criticized
We have flat earthers, but seriously, they're presenting in our schools and doing 'serious' research
Isn’t there a movie about this cult
> To add, the people that say that the current German state is a lie and that Germany still actually operates under the constitution of the Weimar republic/German empire
Why not the DDR
It would be so much fun, like in Goodbye, Lenin
An interview with Székely Sándor:
One could say that during the reunification of Germany the Bundesrepublik didn't absorbe the Demokratische Republik, but umgekehrt
Like Sigmund Jähn and the West-German refugees
I'm just joking around, as if the DDR was a real desirable country to still live in (in spite of the Ostalgie)
Not German, but my grandfather did fight during WW2
He was a warrant officer
He was trained for anti aircraft guns, but he was assigned for anti aircraft machine gun
Of course he was drafted, he had graduated as a jurist and had just began to work at the department of finance
He came from an old, noble family with a long history of intellectuals, of course even when they weren't socialists, they very much disliked the Nazis and the Hungarian Arrow Cross party
He was 23 years old in 1939
He was a very sophisticated, soft voiced and kind person
He died in 2007
He was assigned at the battle at the Don river
It was the part of the battle for Stalingrad
It is infamous that the Germans used the poorly prepared and supplied Hungarian troops as a living shield when the Soviets began a counterattack: 130
000 soldiers perished or disappeared there
The Soviets were the enemy, but the Germans didn't behave a lot better towards the Hungarians
They did shoot down airplanes: mostly I-16 "Rata" planes
I remember he wrote letters to home on the fabric of the parachutes
It was a very cold winter and they had to flee back once the counterattack started
The whole Hungarian army collapsed
They had to walk 300 km back to the Axis lines in -30°C. And then Gusztáv Jány, the commanding officer of the army, assigned a proclamation that the Hungarian Army had lost its honor
He was hung in 1946 for war crimes
My grandpa told a lots of things
For example that they were also frightend by the sound of the Stuka dive bombers even when those were on their side and they weren't the targets
Or that the driver of a truck was shot down while he was sitting next to him: the bullet came from the side, only a few centimeters over his legs
Or that the bunkers were filled with mice like a carpet
Then he came home, but was later reassigned to the West, and then taken as a POW
Fortunately, not by the Soviets but by the Americans, so it wasn't that bad, and it lasted less than a year
He told that the Americans gave lots of goods and supplies to the POWs, but most of those were stolen the "guards" who were assigned from among themselves
EDIT:
he had married my grandmother only months before the battle for Stalingrad
They bought a flat in Buda (which we still have) where my 24 years old grandmother had to bear the Siege of Budapest (undeservedly unknown city battle of WW2, it was one of the worst sieges) alone in their flat in 1944 (while my grandpa was POW)
They both wrote a journal about these times
i always use english wikipedia, but hungarian wikipedia is surprisingly good
There is a lot of content on it
Hungarian Wikipédia is suprisingly extensive, although the quality of the articles are often questionable, expecially the ones about the hungarian languges history, and pre-christianity history
Crap, it's sometimes better in hungarian subjects, but most of the time english is just superior even in articles about hungary
Hungarian wiki is not too bad, but my personal preference is always the English wiki
The only exception is some very Hungarian specific topics
It's perfectly normal, we even offer it to guests
Some people use filters but it isn't really necessary for health reasons
That said, there are some really old buildings in Budapest where the lead in the old pipes is an issue
If you live in those buildings it's better to buy bottled water
in Hungary  it's definitely safe and in some regions tap water usually has a better taste than bottled water from anywhere (yes, mineral water doesn't really have a taste but in some of our mountains water has a fresh texture)
Yup
Totally normal
I drink tap water everywhere
At home, at school, restaurants
We have very good quality water
I'll have to note, that (in some parts of Budapest) during peak summer tap water is often quite chlorinated, some people do prefer bottled water during those times
Some regions have naturally disgusting water
Excellent as thermal water for baths, but still kind of (sometimes really) unhealthy
If you float quality mineral water through the pipes for decades, some of those minerals will settle out on the walls and recreate your "contamination". It can be avoided, if you remove all soluble materials, or use distilled water
Try it just once
(and donkey drink much as it's not exactly healthy)
I can assure you that it utterly lacks taste and has a fast flowing oil-like (WD40) like texture to it
>  the only thing exotic about it is the price
exactly, that's why people buy it
that way you can show that you are so well of that you can afford to buy (tap) water for such an exotic price
btw people tend to just buy one and refill the bottle
The government just made the Samsung factory in my town a special economic area, meaning the tax from it (which amounted to 1/3 of the town's budget) now goes to the government controlled county council, instead of the opposition controlled town council
Oh and to top it all off, the insanely corrupt government says it's because the opposition are corrupt
Is it really Airbnb though, instead of domestic and foreign real estate investors in general
Barcelona's metropolitan area has a bigger population than Ireland's and they are in the forefront of fighting Airbnb, and according to their own estimates, the number of units in such use is a little under 20 thousand
And as nice as your country is, I'm sure tourism is a fraction of Barcelona's.
Met one English guy here on a stag party in Budapest, but we had an awesome chat over a few cigs, great experience all around
Oh, the usual
A lot of people hate it, some people love it, but most just don't care all that much, I'm afraid
In Budapest the negative stereotype doesnt seccessarily come from being british, its the obnoxious pubcrawl drunkness is the bad part
Never heard anyone complain about british tourist for any other reason
Also its not just you guys, the germans do it too
Yeah, a lot of people don't realise that what the government does isn't just in the news, they will feel it on their own skin as well
Hopefully this whole crisis will change that a bit, but I wouldn't bet on it
Pretty sure I've heard of all of them
Not sure about Catania though
ughh the amount of time we mentioned it in spanish class
im getting ptsd any time i see the name xd
Maybe with German names
* Iași = Jassenmarkt
* Bydgoszcz = Bromberg
* Timișoara = Temeswar
* Cluj-Napoca = Klausenburg
* Constanța = Konstanz(a)
* Craiova = Krajowa
* Galați = Galatz
Learn the vowels first, it's really important
We have 14 of them (a, á, e, é, i, í, o, ó, ö, ő, u, ú, ü, ű)
Think that you learn an alien language
It's going to be easier then
Every rule has an exception and a 'backdoor way of saying'.
Don't be surprised if finding yourself considering giving it up
Don't even try
And then give it up because its hard AF
Alternative:
Buy textbook
Open textbook
Assume fetal position and cry for approximately 2,5 hours
Reevaluate your life choices
(Or maybe I just suck at grammar)
Of course languages go through some kind of "economisation" over time, but if something is working perfecly fine I don't see the point why get rid of it
Hungarian has 18 cases
English has a trillion phrasal verb which is a pain in the ass to learn all of it
As for exeptions, look up the japanese verb conjugation, it's just so simple and beautiful, they have three groups of verbs and almost no exeptions
We have 44 letters
There are just too many and high school me couldn't handle them
Sometimes they just seemed so unlogical
For example when "a plane takes off", why is it off
Why not up
It's going upward so for me the logical one would be up, but no, let's give it a twist and make it off, lol
But honestly, I've got a terrible english teacher in high school so maybe because I hated her my relationship with the english language is not that smooth that I'd like it to be
Well, yeah
History
The European identity first and foremost is based on shared history
Yes, that pleases my ego
I think this is the best answer
Look at Asian countries - they don't even have Latin words in their languages that we take for granted and is a commonality between us Europeans, their culture is so different
Of course, Europeans exported their languages to other parts of the world, so that's not necessarily the best comparison, but it definitely originated from here, and there are other differences between Argentinan and European people (where they speak Spanish) for example that are noteworthy too and more obvious
Not to mention other "groups" like Muslims, Africans, Indians, etc
I guess America is hard to tell, but I think you can by a few things
- but they are also just far from us
Plus they don't take their Greek and Latin  origins that seriously
Maybe if you count the ancient ceremonial buildings of native Americans, too, because 400-500 years old churches don't count as old as fuck in Europe at all
Even we have churches from after 1000 AD
Yeah, I was just referring to the culture, not the language itself
It's just in certain schools where you have to learn Latin
Sorry for the confusion
I would watch that show
If you cry - "Don't soak the mouses"
If you yawn - "Are you waiting for the fried dove to fly into your mouth
If you don't eat the carrot - "You won't be able to whistle" or "It has A vitamin in it, you'll have a better sight from it"
If you watch TV for too long - "Your eyes will pop out"
If you pick your nose - "Do you have a mining permit
Mine also said stuff like "Your mouth is as large as the Viennese gate" when I was too loud, "It doesn't close with a zip tie" when I left a door open, "Your stomach will go cold" when I talked too much and that's all I can think of right now
In Hungarian like every word is written how it's spelled
same here
Edit: ok there are 3 exceptions:
Tradition: if you have a stupid noble name like Széchenyi or Batthyány
That´s a totally different pronounciation, you don´t wanna know
Grammar: for example by conjugating some verbs: higyje is pronounced higgye
Or compounds: bab+püré, babpüré is pronounced bappüré (becomes voiceless)
Simplifying: for example digraphs that are pronounced long are not written doubled but simplified: Mennyi and not menynyi
Also the j and ly
They used to be different sounds but they are pronounced the same now, however the writing never changed
\#2 is actually spelled wrong
To make things more interesting (sing
indicative to imperative):
hagy+j = hagyj
hisz+j = higgy
&#x200B;
Phonemicity is occasionally broken by assimilation in pronunciation, too (eg
'szabadság', 'mindnyájunk', 'különbség' etc
This occurs regardless of compositicity (is that a word I just made up
oh shit I spelled it wrong you´re right
Just like an English s in sun
Árnyékszék- shadow chair, it sounds dumb tho
My dad always called it "Fajansz", simply because the particular ceramics from which toilet bowls are made, are called Fayans
The place where even the King has to walk to
Edit: I didn't see OP also wrote the same in their post (probably we just translated it differently)
The place of decency (illemhelyiség)
Te tetted e tettetett tettet te te tettetett tettek tettese te
Feels like the Hungarian: Répa retek mogyoró korán reggel ritkán rikkant a rigó
In hungary we call them:
Haver,span-mate
Csajszi,csajos-girl
Tesó,tesa- brother
Here in folklore there is plenty of stuff about mongolian invasian (known here as tatars . often with the attribute d "dog-headed"), and fights with a stereotypcially fat turkish ruler
I have no clue if the stories about the times of hungarians raiding/adventuring in western europe are authentic, or late recreateions
If they are the former, then we have plenty, if the latter then we have nothing
An interesting one:
Hungarian tales usually beginn with this: "Egyszer volt, hol nem volt, az óperenciás tengeren is túl, ott ahol a kurta farku malac túr..."
It translates to: "Once upon a time, beyond the sea of Operencia, where the short tailed pig grunts
The magical land of Operencia is actually Upper Austria and Germany
Upper Austria was called "Austria \*ob der Enns\*" (Austria over the Enns River), but why did hungarian folk tales picked on that
No one knows
For a short period of time the Enns was the border between Hungary and the HRE, and the returning mercanaries told fantastic stories about the pillaging in Germany
Maybe imigrants told their german folktales to their kids and refered to their land of origin (many german tales have a hungarian version)
The sad reality: King Matthias was buried in the Basilique of Székesfehérvár next to his "collagues" I Louise the Great, I Charles and Saint Stephen and around ten other kings
When the turks captured the city the basilique was destroyed and the tombs of the kings were looted
(hehe Tomb raiders) The bones found under the ruins are in several steel boxes in a nerby cript, but we are not sure who are in those boxes
The only untouched tomb was III Béla the Great's or Colomon the Book-lover's.
Apprently this is the offical (or one of the offical) translations :D
I prefer Colomon the Learned
Donar returned to Germany, this time as a turkish dish
20 August, the date our first king, Stephen I, was declared a saint
Today, the day is seen as the Foundation Day of Hungary
The 20 August fireworks are probably more important here than the New Year ones (probably because we sing the anthem at that time instead of playing with fireworks
For those who have no idea who he is: [
I would say Trianon but it was more depressing than ridiculous lol
Hungary also had a king who drowned in a river, however, it was not during the crusades but during one of the most decisive battles in Hungarian history
It resulted in 150 years of Ottoman occupation
I'm not from Moldova but not many people realise that Ukraine is more to the north, east, south, and west then Moldova is
"Budapest" :D You mean in Buda
Budapest was created in 1873
I have never been in Russia, but I also do this
I bet Hungary has the highest number of _destroyed_ castles
Looking at you, Habsburgs
We don't have them
Atleast it's not mandatory and only for older "kids" like 17-20 I believe
It might be wrong
There's this thing called Aquincum, I haven't been there for years but as I remember it's kinda big
Yes, there is one in Budapest (Aquincum) and the cities of Szombathely and Pécs were also ancient Roman cities
(Savaria and Sopianae respectively)
Van egy régi mániám -I have an old mania
It's about invading Romania, and getting back Transylvania, using brutality
I don't nesessary agree with the lyrics, but it has a great tone
This song is using well-known rhythms for Hungarians as a montage, combined with beat box, and funny lyrics which also combine well-known verses
The result is this, a funny music video, with funny lyrics
I like degenerate things like the band Belga, but they are pretty well-known and respected, while this is more on the underground side afaik
I could be wrong
In my opinion this is the peak Hungarian humour, but please don't judge me
I can't translate lyrics, would be too hard to get most meaning accurately, but believeme
Best
Song
Ever
I didn't know, and that's interesting
I always thought it was Russian or Ukrainian
I just listened to a conversation the other day about nowadays' nationalism in Hungary and one of the guys had a good point that answers your question as well:
In Hungary one point, we all (most of us) seem to agree upon, is our language - although it's awkward for other Europeans and pretty much useless because it isolates us, but for some reason we love our language
Another interesting one is that we all (most of us) sing our national anthem on New Year's Eve standing and regardless of religion or religiousness at all, start it by singing "God bless the Hungarian" which gets even more awkward if you consider that it was all the same in communism when religion was rather oppressed
Here it might be controversial, but Orbán's hard stance against illegal immigration is something, that almost everyone in the country supports
Oohh what about  New Kids Turbo
Me and my friends loved it
Strawberries  with a straw - what
It's a cynical political tool that offers a solution to a non-existent problem as barely anyone wants to come here anyway; our real problem is emigration, not immigration
Nobody supports illegal actions
But I know you know that Orbán intentionally interfused refugees of war, economic migrants, legal immigration and illegal border-trespassers
If you say that "as a developed country, maybe we had the opportunity to accept a quota of registered, proven refugees to ease other countries", their propaganda and braindwashed zombies will answer "SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT MUSLIMS SHOULD CROSS OUR HOLY BORDER ILLEGALLY AND UNCHECKED TO RAPE OUR WOMEN AND STEAL OUR JOBS
Okay I need to try the chocolate one
Well, at least you get to talk to Hungarians who are usually the opposite
Yeah, the propaganda surrounding the matters is obviously divisive, I'm just merely talking about the "fence" itself
Also, Belgian waffles best waffles, probably
Oh half of my family lives there
(In Hilden, exactly)
And do you eat like this
or is it just decoration
Very poor choice of words
Oooooh that's some delicious stuff, I love it
Yes, and he was black
Most hungarians are not black, but his father was from Africa
I either missed the /s or you have not been in the inner city recently
One of the tesco delivery guys who delivery my stuff is black (I'm careful with the afro-american because this is not america, sry)
No, because the package is either delivered and signed off personally, or (more likely) you get a green notice that you weren't found at home, even if you literally spend 24 hours at home
If the package disappears, that 100% happens while it's being delivered
Here it’s has to be signed by somebody from the house or dropped of to neighbors/post office
But my package was stolen by the post service itself . They will say it was delivered even if it has a tracker
never happened to me fortunately
Yall never heard of Komló and it shows
Necarsulm is pretty ugly, too
An autobahn-junction, the Audi-plant, the headquarters of Lidl/Kaufland and that big ass power plant
They at least pay a lot of taxes to the city making it on of the richest in Germany
And a decent football team(?)
Guys we can't miss Ecser and every other similar little city/village
Who wouldve thought right
Is your country part of the Erasmus program
Because if so, you'll have an option to attend an Erasmus scholarship and if your petition gets accepted, than you can go to any high-education school freely
I believe Hungary is a quite nice choice
It isn't that far from the west, and you can still get great education here while living quite cheaply
u/kingofkonfiguration I ask both of you:
do I have to live in Denmark at least 3 years to get it, or is there any other requirements
(for an EU citizen)
Alcohol in pubs
In smaller, less frequented pubs 10 euros gets you two beers, two wines, 4 spirits and a packet of peanuts
Booze
Hence we host all your stag parties, where you barf and piss on our streets
Fake EU citizenship
Alcohol, probably the cheapest
(erasmus experiences, everyone said that booze is really cheap here)
It's getting more expensive though
A few years ago you could buy a pint of decent beer for less than a Euro, even in Budapest
LOL, I pay 5,59 eur for 3+2 GB data (+2GB because of "youth option" - anyone under 25 can apply for it for free)
Still not as good as 100 gb for 6 euros in Romania
aren't we all
Really on the contrary, m8
Yes, very much
And we just had a surprise thunderstorm yesterday
Hungary's thunderstorm season lasts from late April to early September, although we expirence storms in winter sometimes, but usually that means that the Cb produces one lightning or two
But yesterday it was totally a summer-style squall line with many lightnings and pouring rain
It was caused by the low Ciara/Sabine
We also have some tornados
Like a more significant one (= EF1 or EF2) every 2-3 year, so not very often
But non-tornadic supercells happen pretty often; the geography of Central Europe however isn't in favour of producing similar synoptic patterns like on the Plains in the US
I do
Especially in summer
I don't even like light raining or snow
Fuck that wet bullshit

Wooow that shit is impossible in hungarian
Leave me alone
Szia, John vagyok és örülök, hogy megismerhetlek
Honnan jöttél?
Hi, John I am and happy that (being able to) meet
Where come
Agglutinating languages make this harder
I put the coherent parts which are contained in one word in brackets
Szia

_Hi
[As John] [I'm called], [I'm glad] the [for luck]

Jó napot, János vagyok
Örülök, hogy találkoztunk
Maga hol lakik
Good day, John am-me
‘To be happy’-me, that met-we
‘Casual-formal singular you’ where ‘to live’-‘formal singular you’?
Jó Napot, János vagyok

Eh, it would be a bit problematic
Hi, John I-am, pleasured-I-am the meeting-for
Where-to belonging-to you-are
Yup, didn't want to bring too much grammar in it, just mirror translate as the post said, though adding "to" after(Hungarian grammar)/before(English grammar) "where" is a good idea
Btw, the logic is if you completely ignore agglutination, translation would just sound like English in Yoda style
Homo Sapiens, very gruesome creature
We have a lot of them
Actually, Polar bears are 'only' the third largest species of bear
And with that the third largest carnivore on land
I think I once read something with the Kodiak bear and another bear species
Ok nevermind just found out I was wrong

lmao
Every time you destroy a wave without a loss, you save the game

One of them is head of government, the other is head of state
Chancellor is a German thing
They like to call the head of government that way
I think maybe Austria too
So Merkel is a Chancellor, or with a much sexier word, Bundeskanzlerin, and is not called the “prime minister”.
Presidents and prime ministers are not equally important, in different countries one has more authority than the other, the other being more like a figurehead
Macron and Putin are presidents of their country, and I don’t even know their prime ministers
Boris Johnson is prime minister of the UK (but everybody knows the head of state of the UK, Queen Elizabeth)
We were occupied for 45 years after that, so no, not really
It's set in December 1944, weeks before the Siege of Budapest
Four men have been friends for years, and they go to the pub of one of them every evening, and they talk
About everyday things, how to cook meat properly, what kind of cigarette the pub owner was able to get (during the war), but also theoretical questions of morality; if you can choose, do you choose the fate of an innocent but tortured slave or that of a cruel and evil, but unharmed (and oblivious to his crimes) king
But very soon the theory becomes practice, and they have to choose
*A tanú* - it's one of the greatest movies ever
A Tanú, Best Hungarian movie ever
Full of puns tho
You should check out Eternal Winter (Örök Tél) it's a great historical movie about the soviet era, it won an Emmy award
Kontroll is also a great one
Agreed
Berlin
I feel ya buddy :'(
We are already busy with Transylvania though
It's cool that your country is led by a dragon
Trade with us
:-)
Orban effectively destroyed our country for decades to come only to feed his ego and pockets
He is very talented, I give him that and could have been a formidable leader but he just become a toxic crook and a sorry copy of Putin
Even if we get rid of him (which is nigh-impossible now as he controls EV-UH-RYTHING) the public division and the moral decline will have an effect for the foreseeable future
If he wins again, my family will leave the country for sure
You can take him now, free of charge
Her uncle - the former king - was a nazi
in our mythology/fairytales dragons do tend to have 3 or 7 heads
Can you please stop this shit about immigration
Sure, it's all fine and dandy that he defended Hungary from immigration but what he's doing to Hungary is just sad and infuriating
I really hate when people glorify him, just because they know 1 aspect of his ideologies
> Crime vastly increased
The fact that almost nobody can understand it outside of Hungary
We can create words in soooo many possible way
There are tons of way to make a sentence
I speak English and German (and learning Spanish), and I haven't experienced the same
German words can be long, but that's just "adding words to another".
Hungarian language is very creative
No genders, neither the nouns nor the pronouns
Probably Hungarian would be the perfect language for the crazy American SJWs
We literally say peoplekind
It's just correct that way
We only have 3 tenses more like 2 and a half
Only past, present and future, but it's possible to avoid future in most of the conversations, because present usually applies too
Also sometimes Hungarians use present when It should be the past
It's not interchangable like furure but kinda frequently, usually when you tell a story
Various phonetics
We supposed to be pronunciation geniuses because Hungarian contains almost all the sounds of other languages, except the R in French and German and a few less prominent others
Despite this, Hungarians are usually miserable at pronouncing foreign words, We could probably spot the Hungarian from a thousand non native English speakers
The sounds are correct but the intonation is usually horrendous, the outcome is just butchering English
Endless, variable cuss words, and swearing without any cuss words
There's a million ways to tell somebody to fuck off
My personal favorite is 'Anyád szülne sünt
Or if the person who pissed you off is a cocky biologist you can tell them 'Anyád szülne kifejlett sünt
It means 'I hope your mother gives birth to hedgehogs
We were taught to give whole sentences as an answer to questions in English classes, however Hungarian has a different approach
It allows us to create a positive answer only using a suffix (that we use as prefix)
-Kivitted a szemetet
(Have you taken the trash out
-Ki
(Out)
Hungarians in Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and Serbia:
*Am I a joke to you
it's kind of a double edged sword because we can't spread our beautiful language
Can you understand this
"A rákos kurva anyádat basszad meg te gecisfaszú"
Oh yeah i mean 2 days later i'll be correct
(Jk don't take it seriously i don't want to be killed by everyone bc of this comment)
Kurw/va is the glu what holds together our friendship
Idk i think hungarian is a quite useless language for forgeiners, everyone who want to have some kind of advantages in life should learn spanish, french, german or italian after english
Hungarian is only for those few who just want to speak a non widely spoken language
Ahw yeah that's one of my favourite things about italian
I feel soo nice when i read a sentence with an unknown word and i can (almost) pronounce it correctly
>Oh yeah i mean 2 days later i'll be correct
***ANGRY ROMANIAN NOISES***
Edit: yay Trianon expires /s
psst don't tell them our secret plan
Eh, I don't think that's true, any language is useful as long as there are businesses in that country, you can find a company that looks for its speakers because everything is international nowadays
Sweden also has a population of 10mil, and you can see people learning it because it's easy
I'm not sure i think hungarian is not as useful as other languages and really hard to learn so if i hadn't been hungarian i'd have learned other languages first
Cause they live in Hungary
It's very hard to measure a language's usefulness
The thing is that since those languages you mentioned are really very popular, there is a big competition for them since everyone wants to speak them, so their value is elsewhere, not in the number of speakers
:) Imagine someone speaking 2 Center/Eastern European languages like Polish/Russian and Hungarian, and you will see that there is demand for them
It's just an option, but it might be worth it to think about
> really hard to learn
this is what I'm saying, people don't want to learn it since it's hard
Same goes for Russian and Polish
Yeah but it's the same as the german companies coming to Hungary
They don't learn the language and it's easier for everybody to just speak german
Yeah there must be some kind of advantage by speaking hungarian but it's rare imo for a forgeiner to learn hungarian and master it to a conversational level, therefor companies tend to require hungarians to learn their language
Then they are Hungarian gypsies
Emberek angolul beszélnek többnyire a cégekben
Nekik a szaktudás kell, ha idejönnek, és a németek közül mindenki beszél angolul, aki idejon
Hát igen erről beszélek, hogy a magyar nyelv megtanulása egy külföldinek annyira körülményes sztem, hogy egyszerűbb egy másikat használni helyette
Ja, de szerintem aki megtanul egy harmadik, negyedik nyelvet, az már más módon szeretné kamatoztatni, mint ilyen céges környezetben
Probably sausages
It's tasty, but it's basically the insides of a pig being put inside its guts
Btw there are so many I can't even count it
Pacal, which is a stew made of cattle stomach (at least two kind afaik), and it's great
The whole process of disznóvágás: the whole family comes together to slaughter a pig, with copious amounts of alcohol consumed
All parts are used,  a traditional dish on that day is baked blood with onion, which is exactly what the name says
It looks and tastes like liver, just flatter
Kakastöke pörkölt maybe: it literally means rooster's balls stew, and that's what it is
edit: a word was missing
Yea
it has it's hungarian version, oké, it's basically okay without the y sound
OK is quite frequently used
However, okay is not used, we prefer the Hungarian variant oké (pronounced nearly the same)
Although I would prefer if we would use "rendben" instead
It's very common
We even changed the writing of the word to fit the hungarian pronunciation
From "okay" to "oké".
I wouldn’t really say we use the English word ok but we do say oké in Hungarian which means the same thing
We use oké, ok or okés depending on your mood and who you speak to
Some people also use "okés".
it's spelled the same in Hungarian
and people tend to use it interchangeably with the 'ok' form
I also say okaj, okka and oksi too
I don't think it's common per se, but I think it's more up to one's personal taste
Somehow it feels like "rendicsek" would be more common, as a playful substitution for "rendben".
Two thirds of it are gone, but if he waits another year he will see it anyway
We will then have a long and unfruitful conversation about whether the allied forces drew the borders this badly in the region on purpose, or they simply weren't using their brains
The Sebrian-Croatian-Slovenian Kingdom sure sounds like the name of a country that will stay unified without any ethnic strife for centuries to come
Oh, and the nazis will blow up the Chainbridge
It's all downhill mate
Surprise mechanics
Oh well the world wars really didn’t work out for us, yeah…
Come to think of it I just assumed citizens of the successor states of the Serb-Croat-Slovenian Kingdom think that it was bad that they were chucked together
I have no idea how much power you guys had over the whole map-drawing, I assumed none or close to none
My comment isn't meant as a callout for Serbia & crew, I think you had just as much if not more suffering as a result of the Versailles peace dictatum
Now that I'm thinking about it I am very interested in your take on it if you feel like sharing your opinion
I read the wikipedia page, and from that perspective it could have seemed to be something that might work out, it just didn't.
I think Versailles was a good chance to make sure that wherever serbs liva, that's Serbia, where romanians live, that's Romania, where hungarians live, that's Hungary, etc
, and so there would have been a lot less war and hate and bitterness
The solution not based on nation states ended in tragedy
And while I'm sure some did identify as yugoslav, I'm also sure a whole lot of others thought of themselves as slovenes and so on, so saying that Yugoslavia was a nation state is kind of a stretch
I think everyone knows Poland existed in 1939
"Ág" in Baranya county
"Bő" and "Sé" in Vas county
"Őr" in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county
Ther is also "Ács" and "Öcs" are three characters little ng, but officaly they are two letter long, because "cs" is one letter
/Translations/:
Ács- Carpenter
Öcs- probably comes from the name of the original holders of the land
First form: Ech
Bő- archaic word for rich, today means loose (loose like clothes)
Ág- branch
Őr- guard
Sé- archaic word for Creek
Yes, it is, together with the Dutch town of Ee, which is the shortest-named place in the Netherlands
As a French speaker, I can understand quite a bit from Spanish texts or the very least guess what is it about
On the other hand, I cannot understand spoken Spanish at all
I speak Hungarian, English and German and I understood almost every word
Pronouns etc
can be easily guessed from context, and the words are very similar to their counterparts in English
I got the battle of midway
I could make out about 50% of the words and I got the context
But true, it's really weird
And I guess I could only understand most of it because I know the topic

It isn't strange or unnecessary at all
The _Lord of the Rings_ was translated into Hungarian by Árpád Göncz who later (in 1990) became the first president of Republic of Hungary, and was one of the most beloved politicians of the post-1990 times
He did a very great and good effort to translate these kind of names from the novel into Hungarian, also to make it sound like in a tale
All the later movies used his translations
Baggins is "Zsákos" in Hungarian, meaning the same
Also, Harry Potter was translated (by another person) so that those characters who have generic English names (like HP himself or Ron Weasley etc) kept their names, but those who had a meaning were translated
Even places, objects, for example even Hogwarts is called "Roxfort" in Hungarian because the translator thought Hogwarts is more difficult to pronounce in Hungarian, doesn't sound good, and it's a good wordplay creating a name from "Oxford" (like a place of higher education) and the cheese Roquefort
I read an interview with the translator a long time ago, he explained very detailed why he all these did
In Hungarian, Baggins was translated as "Zsákos" ('one posessing/carrying a sack')
(Also if I might add, I don't know anything about the language, but I just really love the sound of Torbar
The translations of Harry Potter have much more examples of this
For starts, Hogwarts is called 'Roxfort', many of the names are changed (most notably, Snapes becomes Perselus Piton) and the house names are also translated (Gryffindor - Griffendél, Slytherin - Mardekár, Ravenclaw - Hollóhát, Hufflepuff - Hugrabug)
Having grown up on these I don't necessarily find these strange nor unnecessary;  especially since it is targeted towards a younger audience, these translations make the text easier to read, as names like Roxfort or Mardekár roll off the tongue much more easily than the original English names
The titles for the Star Wars movies in Hungary have been quite ridiculous since you can't decide if Sith or Jedi is meant as singular or plural, but it has to be decided for the movie titles
Listed below are the Hungarian titles, with literal English translations in brackets
I: Baljós Árnyak (menacing shadows)
II: A klónok háborúja (the clone wars)
III: A sithek bosszúja (revenge of the sith, plural)
IV: Egy új remény (a new hope)
V: A birodalom visszavág (the empire strikes back)
VI: A jedi visszatér (return of the jedi, singular)
VII: Az ébredő erő (the awakening force)
VIII: Az utolsó jedik (the last jedi, plural)
As a fellow countrymen already spoke about Harry Potter and the LOTR, I only have on thing to say: Breaking Bad
Its called 'Totál szívás' in Hungarian and
I dont know
The name itself is indeed hard to translate, but the translation they had is just awful
I wouldnt even know how to translate it back to English but I dont think its similar enough to the original title
> The *Lord of the Rings* was translated into Hungarian by Árpád Göncz who later (in 1990) became the first president of Republic of Hungary, and was one of the most beloved politicians of the post-1990 times
However we do have a strange translation of *The Hobbit* by Tibor Szobotka
* Featuring stuff like calling the ring *szívem szottya* (\~my heart's "..." word that imitates a glump of slime/goo splashing down on the ground) instead of *drágaságom* (\~my precious)
* Translating the word hobbit as *babó* (baba = baby so its equivalent would be something like babi)
* *Gollum* is called *Nyelem* (\~i am in the process of swallowing it) for some reason instead of phonetic transcript of *Gollam
* *Tölgyfapjzsi Thorin* (Thorin out of Oakenshield)
* Midsummer night is for some reason translated as St
John's Eve - regrdless that its nonsense in the context of the book
* Shire is called *kerek ország* (\~ round country)
So its pretty strange - probably *szívem szottya* takes the gold medal out of the whole nonsense, but the other contenders are pretty strong  hve to admit
On the plus side it managed to get some stuff right - despite the complete lack of need to translate elven words
* Lembas as *kreksz* (a wordplay on *keksz* (=biscuits))
* Mirkwood as *setéterdő* (*erdő* means forest, and *setét* is a old/locally used variant on *sötét -* meaning dark)
It does
Actually, the translator actually said in this interview that he could translate his name, too, as "Fazekas Henrik" (which is the literal translation of this name), but he chose not to because it would have been silly
His job was to differentiate between the names and stuff to be translated and not to be translated
In Hungarian: "Tom Rowle Denem" -> "Nevem Voldemort"
Actually, Remus Lupin is among those few who kept their name
While Hungarian not being an indo-european language, our word for wolf is not originated in lupus anyhow (actually, "farkas" is "(animal) with tail" which is a funny realization for me right now, because normally noone ever thinks about this when saying wolf), so however the translator would have translated it to indicate the connection with a wolf, it would have been a big giveaway - I think he chose rather not to spoil the book, and kept the original name
Snape in the other hand is translated to Piton (Python)
Okay, for example:
Diagon Alley -> since this pun works only in English, it's called "Abszol út", a pun, because "abszolút" means "absolutely", but written apart means "Absol road".
As a European yes, but that is complementary of feeling I am losing a part of world heritage
Nevertheless before drawing any conclusion I am not sure whether my sense of being culturally European is the same as people of France
Same materials could be used, they can even turn to the domestic experts of [Guédelon Castle]
I lived with a Swedish guy who got (rightfully) angry at the also-Swedish neighbour and I’d never seen such aggressive passive-aggressive in all my life
He was making plans to randomly hide and put back the towels in the shared bathroom just to mess with her and spend all day on the balcony so she wouldn’t feel comfortable using it
It went well beyond notes
It's certainly
a skill
Bonus question: I've heard that Transylvania Saxon is similar to Luxembourgish
Can anyone tell how mutually intelligible these two languages are
May I ask how Transylvania Saxons come into this picture
I've read that it's similar to Luxembourgish

The [Őszöd speech] Scandalous speech in 2006 which led to mas protests and the collapse of the MSZP party (and kinda the left too)
It would be quite important to know another language but unfortunately there are still many people here who don't speak English and struggle with language learning, especially the older generations, the situation is a bit better among university students and young adults, but still not as good as in the Nordic countries
Yet we're on the bottom in statistics
Some recent sources say we're above UK in speaking at least one foreign language, but a good percentage of that would be German
Personally I'd say hardly anyone speaks any bit of English under uni/college degree, in elementary/hs even the teachers don't speak English (my sister is currently in hs and she struggled with Duolingo basic English when she began learning in her free time cause the school is useless - my teachers weren't any different either) everything is dubbed, a major amount of internet content is available in Hungarian too, so many people just don't bother
It's pretty sad
If it's a closer friend or a relative, then i don't think it's rude
Otherwise, it's really fucking weird
If you’re a really close friend, no
If you’re not a close friend, it’s weird, rude, or some other word along these lines

Can you top that
In the one hand I was just joking, in the other hand this phenomen is very familiar, since we also have very similar, very small-scale DMUs for the branch lines with the least passenger traffic - without the "Bzmots" those lines would have been closed for a long time now
Holy shit
I wholeheartedly support banning him from the Earth

It has to be from the governments pre-approved list of names which comes from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences - Institute of Linguistics
List (in Hungarian)
There is the *Utónévkönyv* (Book of Given Names), which includes all names that can be given
New ones can be added, but they have to be requested from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
The rules for new names are:
No unisex names
If a name was already added for one gender, it cannot be added for the other
Names have to follow Hungarian orthography
Foreign names have to be written as we pronounce them (e.g. ~~Jennifer~~ Dzsenifer)
Ancient Hungarian names can only be added if they are supported by a credible source, and are not offensive
Fantasy names from Hungarian literary classics can be added if they are not offensive
Fantasy names from foreign literary classics can be added if they are already used frequently as a given name abroad
If the name has a Hungarian variant, it is recommended that it should be preferred over the foreign variant
If the foreign name has no Hungarian variant, it should be used in a foreign culture, should not be offensive, and not a unisex name
Newly created names should fit into Hungarian/European naming culture (e.g. many women are named after flowers, new flowers may be added to the list)
They should not be offensive
Nicknames should be more popular than their "official" counterparts
Geographical names are not allowed, unless the geographical name comes from a given name
Different spellings may be added, if they follow Hungarian orthography, and other names also show these spelling patterns
A variant of the name for the other gender may be added, should follow usual gender patterns
Names should not cause harm to children
> when you hear a name like Márszelusz or something
Ah, yes, and now this trend of parents giving their kids foreign names, but of course its spelling has to be made phonetically consistent with the pronunciation in order to be approved, which is how we ended up with names like Justin -> Dzsasztin and Ginger -> Dzsindzser (at least it isn't Dzsindzsör.. that'd be even worse)
Watch me name my firstborn Dzsornó Dzsovanna ...
Uhg, hate to see this practice so much
They publish a list of rejected names regularly, going through that list is extremely painful
I'm so glad we can't name babies "Koronavírus" (coronavirus) or "Karantén" (quarantine)
I pity the people in any country without regulations
Oh damn
This was a cartoon in Hungary as well :) I remember it
The "Csodák palotája", or "Palace of wonders".
It was created by a loveable old priest/teacher TV presenter, who had a program on the national television in the '50-'60s, where he taught kids physics and chemistry through simple experiments that you could replicate at home, and explained the mechanics behind them
The whole museum is an interactive playground, where kids can learn about things like  acoustics, momentum, velocity forces and gravity
Not affiliated with them, I just fucking love the place
Yay science
Not really
We all speak English and German (and our native Hungarian)
My parents learned Russian in school, but have already forgotten all of it
If we want to talk about something, and we don't want the little ones to understand it, we simply use unusual words/euphemisms
I speak more languages than my parents, but I've never heard of such thing in other families either
I'm originally from a Hungarian area in Slovakia
My parents used Slovak if they didn't want me and my brother to understand them and I always felt terrible because of that
Also I was working in a hotel in Cyprus during a summer and told everyone I was from Hungary (by that time I was really livig here)
I had a few Bulgarian coworkers there and caught them speaking ill of me
I know just enough Slovak so I could understand that they were talking about me and that they were saying mean things
They had no idea I realized what was happening
Yes, many are
>We all speak English and German (and our native Hungarian)
This refers to my family
Any sort of naïve attempt is 100% fail guarantee, so the reaction is "OK, fine you wanna maybe try and speak say English instead
?" at best
So yeah, but nah
If you want to try take at least a few weeks' course, otherwise it's useless, but it's useless anyway
In my opinion it should be a serious national effort to learn/teach at least English at least to an advanced level at a primary school level, but that's not gonna happen due to the general current moral status of the country
Well
I think most Hungarians would appreciate a foreigner who's here and trying to make an effort to learn the language, especially since the general population's English skills are not that great, and it'd also be massively appreciated because most Hungarians think it's the hardest language in the world
They might have a chance to get their point across with broken Hungarian after a few years of learning
If their knowledge of the language is 0 and they are trying to ask for directions or whatever, it’s best to stick to English or their native language and gesturing / google translating
Pronunciation is never right in these cases, often incomprehensible
Trying with words strung together from a dictionary is not annoying per se, but usually doesn’t work
And of course they don’t understand anything you’re trying to say
Thank you so much for this advice
Been learning German for quite some time now and never knew how I should interact with German speaking people since I still cannot speak the language really well
I usually just say thank you and bye in local language
I think it’s a nice touch
I am from Hungary
People in Belgium used to switch to english and I sticked to french so we both struggled
Their english was at the same level or worse than my french most of the time
The other thing that might happen occasionally, for some reason my accent in french sounds like flemish so people might switch to flemish
And there is a visible confusion, because all I can do is switch to english, but I still have no clue what they are saying
Kutyáidat sétáltatod
It was more like you sounded like flemish
Then they appologized
It happened in Brussels
In Flanders I normally start with english anyway
But I get the nationalistic vibe there

Laws are not controlling a society, just offer a reasonable way of living together
But it’s up to the people to actually follow them
If anyone wants to break to rules, it’s not impossible to do that, just penalized
Legalization is a great way to put high taxes on cannabis (like the way it’s done with tobacco) so the extra health issues could be covered by that tax money and quality control can lower the costs as well
what i'm saying is they *try* to control society, but not actually doing it, since people have the choice not to follow the law
and that's fine, i rather live in a society where i can decide if i want to follow the laws or not to follow and have it's consecvences
but since it's impossible to make everyone follow the law it's stupid to think everyone will
therefor law is more of a mutual contract between the state and the individual than an actual controlling mechanism
For some inexplicable reason, I thought sour cream was unique to Hungary and its immediate surroundings
I used to think England (I guess I didn't know the difference between England and UK back then) is a part of continental Europe
Somewhere around France and Germany
My thought process was, that such an important country (where all the cartoons on Cartoon Network come from) can't be on an island
On a similiar note, I'm hungarian, and I was convinced hungarians are the descendants of huns, because:
* HUNgary
* Attila is still a very common male name here
* It is known that Attila's fort was somewhere within the Carpathian basin, the area of historic Hungary
Turns out, all this is just a coincidence, as the earliest mentions of hungarians/Hungary never contained the 'H', it was just "Ungri".
Spain and not-Spain
There is a small village in Hungary, called Imola, but I was sure even as a child that they don't have a race track
But there was a rally stage in the past, so not that unrelated to motorsports as it sounds first
We aren't? :O

We call it Magyarország so I had no idea why was it called Hungary in English

As far as I’ve observed Barcelona is a lot worse in that manner

) The second biggest issue is scam, with young ladies inviting tourists for a drink, then getting a huge bill for drinks etc
not consumed
But this is also restricted to the touristy spots
(With a little bit of common sense, scams like this can be easily avoided)
Violent crimes are very rare - I would not say nonexistent - but especially rare
So what happened
I’m really curious why you feel like that
Disagree, London has tourist attractions but the city itself is so big that most of the city is not touristy and the sheer number of Londoners "soak up" tourists
Smaller towns like Dubrovnik absolutely get wrecked by tourists because they are small
Even if on paper less tourists visit, they are just not ready for that many people
I love the taste of Starbucks coffee
Not really what you can get at the café but how I prepare it at home
Omnia has a nice edition called Omnia Barista, bc i brew coffee with a filter paper the Brazilian one is the best choice for me

why
I doubt all Swedish girls are the same, maybe they're just a little more reserved so it takes longer to get to know them
Well, butter is kinda amazing, so that's understandable
There is a pretty common surname _Lovas_. It means "horse rider".
You pronounce it like "loh-wash".
When German people see this name, they often pronounce it according to their system, so as "loh-fahss".
_Lófasz_ means "horse dick" in Hungarian
Meleg means warm and gay at the same time
Also we say "I have warm" instead of "I'm warm" when it's literally translated, but if you say "I'm warm" (Meleg vagyok), it means "I'm gay". You are supposed to say "Melegem van" or "I have warm".
Also not really grammar, but cultural I guess: Csókolom is usually a valid formal saying hi to females only, it means "kisses" roughly, and it comes off weird if you use it incorrectly on males usually
They are trying to make it a thing, but its very recent
We mostly use Gen X and Gen Z.
I always cringe hard when I read baby boomers and millenials as words

Its really stupid and the fact that its getting everywhere is very irritating

Up until this point I thought that this generation thing was low-key a meme and no one really took it serious

In Hungary there are many abandoned asylums around bigger cities since the government decided to shut them down
They are very popular places among horror-fan teens and maybe junkies
In my experience after working with Brits for a while, they are extremely polite and politically correct during working hours but once they got their pint after work they become easy going and don't spare the curse words including "fuck". So it depends on the situation
A means the
Ő is he/she
a = the
e = this (used mostly in literature)
We have "a", it means "the"
a - the
e - this
In Hungarian we have
Ő - She/he
A - The
E - Is a word that can used to make questions
S - shortened version of and (és)
Ó - Hungarian version of oh
Á - Hungarian version of ah
The only I can think of is 'a' meaning 'the'
ő - (s)he
a - the
e - this
ő - she/he/her/him
a - the
ó - (a sound to express wonder or surprise)
á - (a sound to express pain or refusal)
not really used anymore: e  - this (pointing to a close object)
not really used anymore: s - and (conjunction)
We use “a”, or “az” depending on whether the following word starts with a consonant or a vowel, as the definite article
"e" can also mean "this" in some older dialects
Ó could mean 'old'
I don't get why it is rude
To my mind to keep it being concealed is only advantageous for companies
It is, I dont even know how much my closer family makes
Imo its one of the topics that are taboo right now but it really shouldn't be
Maybe he doesn't even know
I don't think my dad knows the exact figure, because tax is confusing
I would say it isn’t. I talk about wages and financial topics with my family and friends
I tell my salary to anyone if the question is valid for some reason
On the other hand at the company we don’t talk about salary with the colleges
We don’t want to get into an awkward situation if someone finds out he/she earns less for the same job
This is very common in Hungary
I guess it depends on people toon then, may not really be a country dependent thing
I was always taught never to talk about or ask about how much anyone made
Green by far, only ever see black olives on pizza
Even then it's 50/50, depends on the place
I see both, but maybe green olives are a bit more popular, I'm not entirely sure
I personally only buy green ones
I was told that the black ones sold here are mostly artificially dyed
I don't know if it's true, but I always read the ingredients, and black olives tend to contain iron or something
I just go with products that have minimal or no additives
I live in Slovakia, only the south and east of slovakia is bilingual, most people speak Hungarian better than Slovak
The road signs are in Slovak and Hungarian
The town where I live has a population of about 9K and i only know maybe 20 people who dont speak Hungarian
We have Hungarian Schools
If we want to ask a stranger for directions when we are not in East or South Slovakia the first question always is "Do you speak Hungarian
" And we are very happy when they reply "Igen" :D

Oh my God, this is why I love Reddit
i and everyone around me started going to school alone at 12-13, before that, only those who lived really close could leave (but didn't really, because the parents were not at home yet)
(my school was somewhere between the outskirts and the city centre; no family houses, more cars and some wider roads so i don't think i would have let my child walk there with a light heart)
It depends
If the school is close, children probably walk to school from an early age
Later on, those living further away switch to public transport, mostly when starting secondary education around age 15
Not hungary

Our earliest texts are from the 1200s. In their original written form, they are mostly unintelligible, but if they transcribe it to modern spelling, they can be understood quite well
Poems and texts from the 16th century are basically modern Hungarian with a weird spelling
It can be understood really well
Our earliest writings in Hungarian are from the late 12th and the mid 13th century
If we're talking about the original writing and letters, then apart from some words, it is really hard to understand it
So its like with hungarian
Mostly the same, problems are words that have been forgotten
The first written complete Hungarian sentence that we know of accidentally slipped into a latin document in 1055, the establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany
"feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea"
When you first see it it's strange and doesn't look like Hungarian at all, but once it is translated to modern Hu you're like "oh yeah, that makes sense".
In modern Hungarian it's: "Fehérvárra menő hadi útra".
In English: "to the military road going to Fehérvár (lit
White Castle)"
"Rea" became what's today the -ra and -re suffixes, meaning the word "to" in English
What's interesting is that the -reá suffix is still in use today in some dialects/accents
Later texts come from the 13rd century, for example the "Old Hungarian lamentations of Mary". When transcribed to today's alphabet it sounds strange but mostly understandable
Its mostly spelling issues and a few words here and there that are not used anymore, if you know thedifferences in spelling (as both back then and cureently spelling is phonetic), you can get the meaning
Forgetting articles i guess is pretty common
For example in hungarian you'd say "i eat apple" without an article so people often leave it out
The same with occupations (i am teacher)
My mom always mixes up her “he” and “she”. Like calling a guy she and a girl he because in Hungarian we don’t have those words
In Hungarian -ig means until
"Csináld meg keddig" - do it by Tuesday
Most Hungarians will say do it until Tuesday
Also verb tenses
And word order
In fact a lot of things
Hungarian is just so different
Hungarian has a rather unique array of sounds and pronounciation, we tend to pronounce words as if they were hungarian
It doesn't sound natural at all
[Edit: Spelling mistake]
Word order, because in Hungarian word order is not as strict as English
He/She and other gender specific things, because Hungarian is a genderless language
Pronunciation, English spoken by Hungarians is usually rough and blocky
We rather have 44 letters in the alphabet than pronounce one letter differently, like G and J in English can be tricky
In Hungarian, we don't have an order in our sentences
I mean while the stressed part of the sentence differs, the overall meaning can be the same in sentences composed of the same words but in different order
This fluidity translates to people trying to speak english, not understanding that they have to start the sentence in a given way to get the desired result
We use suffixes for everything basically
These result in the google translator being absolutely clueless when it comes to translating to or from hungatian sentences
Other than that, people usually either know english or don't. Becouse of strong nationalism the overwhelming majority doesn't know any second language
We make photos here as well
If I'd get a dollar for every time I hear someone misuse "make" I'd be rich
Hungarian doesn't have it either and most people say "Vhat
Vhere

Have to agree
I never met anyone who can speak english and says it's thanks to their school
It's always learnt home with some or no help from school
I see nothing wrong with it :P
Well, it's misuse in English, but I won't argue with the common sense point, it's true
English is weird
Meanwhile in Hungarian: *jelenleg* (currently) and *tulajdonképpen* (actually)

I work at a customer service
Think the guy was very proud of his origin then
Huh, good to know
We Hungarians had these a long, long time ago too (I never had the "old" ID), not many people in their 20's know it even existed before which is funny in my opinion
1600: Buda
1700: Buda
1800: Pest
1900: Budapest
Now: Budapest
In 1600 it might have been Pozsony (now Bratislava), as Buda was under ottoman control
But Pest-Buda was still two cities, and Pest was the bigger one
I thought I will go with the biggest city of the Porta to not ruin the joke, but you are right
The two cities were located on the two opposite sides of the Danube, so they were indeed very close
And the divider is basically the river Danube, which I guess answers the question about the clear divide
its because slovakians have a diffrent language
and bratislava is the city name in hungarian
Well yes, in the 1700s-1800s Pest developed way faster than Buda did, so you'll find styles of that era way more there (it's similar to a typical Paris downtown cityscape)
Buda, on the other hand, has the castle district mostly built to its form today in the 1700s. Buda is also quite hilly which gives less space to larger buildings
It consists of suburban areas at a higher rate than Pest, you don't have to go far from the Danube to find detached houses on the hillside, often owned by higher class people
Buda and Óbuda (another town that was independent until the unification, just north of Buda) also have a lot more remains of Roman buildings
The layout is more organized in Pest with boulevards and avenues, while the Buda side is a bit more spaghetti if you know what I mean (because of hills and less dense traffic)
They made a conscious effort to eradicate Hungarian/German names and invent new ones, often naming towns after Slovak nationalists
This was especially common for formerly (or even currently) Hungarian majority towns like Bős which used to be Beš but was renamed to Gabčíkovo
Yeah Slovaks went the extra mile with that
Interestingly enough they kept the 2nd biggest city's name (Kassa -> Košice)
I started learning mostly from the internet, around 12-13 years old
I basically trained myself up to B2-C1 levels until highschool, where I actually took it as a third language (my second language is German)
I finished the 4 year course in half a year and took a B2+ level exam with no review and with an 92%
The joke here
I've been learning German for over 9 years now and I still can't string 5 coherent sentences together
My tips: hearing is the best form of learning, if it has subtitles, even better
Videogames are great for this purpose too
I started in middle-school, I think I was 10 or 11
I wasn't great until high-school, where the teacher made it compulsory to read at least one book in English during the year
The school library had books that were made for this exact purpose,so they were small stories with easy to understand language
About speaking though, you just gotta find opportunities to speak
There are no easy ways around it
Edit: Left out the obvious gaming, and watching series/movies in English
With English subs but dubbed, then English with native subs, and slowly I left the subtitles all together
Well, technically I started to learn it in kindergarten, but the lessons were ridiculous (that teacher's suicide didn't help the class's studies) until near the end of 7th grade when my parents hired a different teacher to supervise me personally, so I could get in the highschool I wanted
Besides, I watch a lot of videos, animes, read books, mangas
I started in 4th grade in elementary school, so around the age of 10
I was mediocre at best
Then I discovered One Direction when I was 12, and since they weren't that popular here, there was very little material about them in Hungarian, mostly just fanfictions
So I started to listen to a LOT of their interviews, and eventually I just caught up
Grammar was just there in my brain, but I was lazy af to learn vocabulary, but somehow I still managed to memorise everything that interested me
I was still afraid to speak, since my teacher said I speak like a toddler in English (7th grade, age 12), so she cannot understand me, I shouldn't ever speak
Then came ASMR (don't laugh, there are really amazing ones)
The first video I watched was by MinxLaura123, she's a really sweet British girl, her accent is everything
Basically while I slept, I was listening to her nearly every night
I went to a private teacher to get extra lessons for a state accredited language exam, and I warned her that she might not be able to understand me
She told me no worries, just say whatever comes to my mind during our conversation
She was SHOCKED, because (in her opinion) I had a perfect British accent
I was like, no way, I've never even been there, how is this even possible
I was successful on the exam on the first try (at the age of 16)
Now I get to speak nearly every day, since I play an MMORPG with an international guild, and I am the Program Coordinator in my university's ESN section
I started learning it on the internet at a pretty early age
I only had my first english class by the time I was in 9th grade and I was already fluent (However my pronunciation was, and still is horrible, but I have the same issue with Hungarian because I have a lisp, so I don't think I can really make big improvements)
So yeah, basically the internet taught me the language, and since then I've been trying to improve my vocab and pronunciation during English classes
I never learned english, i just started playing video games, and started watching youtube videos in english
This obviously means that, i dont speak the language very well, but i think people can understand me, and i can understand the language fully
The only problem i have is pronunciaton, but im looking forward to improve it
My father taught me the basics when I was 3, after that, I used the internet in my free time a lot, so when I got to play Minecraft for the first time when I was around 5-6 I started watching a lot of videos, most of them were English
I didn't understand much, but I didn't use dictionaries or translator applications, I learned almost everything by myself
I am 15 currently and still looking for ways to improve, I watch anime with English subtitles and started reading the Harry Potter saga in English
YouTube vids and video games help a lot too in expanding my vocabulary
I learned english in autodidact way
I study it just since september, because I studied german before highschool
I never took an english class before coming to 9th grade, but I needed to take a test to prove my english knowledge
They putted me in the 11th grade english class where some students already took the language exam - and I was there with 0 experience in the language and my grammar and speaking was horrible at the time
I came down to the 10th grade english class, and I am there since then (still in 9th grade)
My grammar is still not great, but I improved a bit
(I only knew american and australian accent before, so the beginnings were a little bit confusing with the good old british accent)
I understand english speak really well (even the dialects) and some complex scientific studies written in the language (my language skills' 50% is from these geology related studies)
If I can, I watch movies and videos with english subtitles
There is a few words that I can't really translate to my mother language because I didn't learned english through hard studying and dictionaries - I can't really explain this
If I write or read something, I see it in my mind in english, not in hungarian
Edit: btw, hungarian language education system sucks
I'm in a private school, this is why there are language groups
Most of the other schools have grade based teaching system, but my school has a knowledge based
I study german since I was 10 years old (in 4th grade) with the usual way
And I barely understand the memes from r/ich_iel .
I went to Ljubljana initially for one semester and I liked it so much I stayed for a second one
I don't think it's many people's first choice but it absolutely should be
Slovenia is a gorgeous country, there is everything from mountains to seas and since Ljubljana is in the middle of the country everything is at most two hours away
We took ridiculously cheap daytrips to Italy (14€ for a return ticket to Venice), Austria and Croatia
Ljubljana itself is great, it's cozy, completely bikeable (they have their own vintage bikes, they're everywhere) and it has lots of cultural events, insane christmas decoration, parties and 4€ subsidized student meals in restaurants
/promo
Seriously
Sometimes the unpopular destinations are hidden gems
Once I met a Finnish guy who spent his Erasmus in my hometown
A town with population of 160k, in Northeast Hungary (one of the worst regions)
It's boring as fuck and almost noone speaks English here
I have no idea how he ended up here
My friend went their too and he absolutely loved it
The photos he took there absolutely made me want to travel to Slovenia
Hahaha wtf
I mean Turkey is a nice destination for Erasmus, I was there too, but
Kayseri
What a weird choice
Btw it's the twin town/sister city (or whatever that's called) of my hometown and I'm kinda disappointed, but my hometown isn't a cool place either so I guess that's fair
But I honestly wonder how an Erasmus student would deal with the language barrier in that part of Turkey, though
That depends
It's a great experience for getting out of your environment and living somewhere else, but other than that, it's up the individual what they do with this opportunity
Some people just want to party, some want to travel as much as possible (that's pretty common), or make new friends from other countries, or learn/practice a language
Yeah some focus on their education but that's not the majority
My main requirement for the host uni was to be in Turkey
Preferably in a nice part of it
That's it, I went for Erasmus to spend a few months in Turkey (and get away from my home uni, as far as possible)
I lucked out, my uni has a partnership with a private uni in Turkey which has most of its classes in English, including my field
It was honestly the best year of my education and the most useful as well
Why though
Sometimes, but only with groups I know well and clothes/mannerisms/context help
For example, Germans and Austrians look essentially the same physically, but Austrians dress better and talk louder *in general*. And there are broad tendencies, like Slavs tend to have somewhat softer features than Germanic people
Some people really fit the "typical look" of their ethnicity, but most don't.
But it’s just educated guesses and people guess wrong a lot, too
I’ve been mistaken for everything from Estonian to Turkish, with half of Slavdom in between
I am Turkish I live in Hungary and I can spot Turkish people with very little chance of miss, I just wait for them to talk to celebrate my success in this guessing game
Rectangular jaw + gülü eyes = German
Almost always works
That’s funny
I always recognise Hungarians because of the accent
Even if they speak English really well, it’s just unmistakable
Well best translation is googly eyes
Food packaging is the big one, and it is hard to limit that
I don't buy raw veggies in packaging (unless it's something like spinach)
Cut down on meat, espacially beef and lamb
Switch to solid soap instead of liquid and shower gel, if your skin is fine with it
Don't buy things you don't need
Minimalism is green
Don't buy overly specific cleaning products
I have bleach, vinegar, dish soap, a green all-surface cleaner, and coconut fiber sponges for the whole appartment
Buy second-hand clothing and furniture
> Don't use plastic bags when buying fruit and vegetables
Adding to this, for those who live somewhere you have to weigh your produce by yourself, get mesh reusable produce bags
They usually have a cloth flap for the weight/price sticker, so you can just peel off the sticker and reuse the bag
Egy szó, mint száz/one word like a hundred
This is like skipping the content of a story and just saying the end or a summary, I think (maybe I'm wrong, I'm sorry in that case)
I don't know if it's common somewhere but my grandpa used to say the following: "If I'm dead don't asl why my feet are so cold" reffering not to ask stupid questions
Here it's "don't make an elephant from a tick". Or, in rare cases, the English phrase with literal translation
Elírtad bástya h didn't stand in line
I wanted to ask this when I read OP
Does the product Extrawurst come from this idiom or umgekehrt
I mean I always thought it means "you're not getting Extrawurst" means you're not getting that type of meat product (because it used to be a special delicacy etc, so you're not special etc)
I never thought it would mean "you're not getting an additional portion of Wurst
" Actually, the more I'm thinking about it, the less probable it seems I was right
Btw, there is a Hungarian idiom "Nincs extrawurst
" meaning exactly the same, "you're not getting special treatment".
Furthermore: this kind of Wurst is called "párizsi" or "parizer" in Hungarian
But Pariser means something different in German
So it could cause further confusion
EDIT:
From wiktionary
> Pariser (Deutsch)
> Substantiv, m
> [1] Einwohner der Stadt Paris
> [2] umgangssprachlich: Kondom
Btw, die Wurstart ist auch erwähnt
In Hungary, it's a flea and an elephant
The flea as a metaphor for tinyness appears in other contexts as well
I thought it means "condom". But you didn't answer my main question
> Side note, why can't Microsoft or google just make one English version that has all the differences as correct
Because there isn't an official version that lists the correct versions, where does Word get these forms
Bruh, everyone knows that in Switzerland everyone speaks switzerlandese, theres no other language there
And people try to covince me about “german” and “french” and whatnot
Any reason the exclude landlocked countries
Lakes can have beaches too
Either Omega or Leander Kills
Also Paddy and the Rats is a lot of fun
This is definitely one of the most famous Hungarian rock songs ever, but I'm still surprised when people abroad say they know it haha (Kanye sampled the song without permission, got sued for it and had to pay to the band, that story still makes me laugh a bit)
Flair up
I can't link at the moment but its in "New Slaves"
Hungarians don't do that petty inter-city rivalry
With us, it's Budapest against the whole rest of the country
Those who dwell in the capital are   living in the "vízfej", or airhead (as in large, and contains nothing of value), whereas if you live anywhere else, you are a "vidéki", (a hick from the countryside)
We do a lot of things wrong, but damn, if you need to make fun of someone, we shine
So what you’re saying is, there’s a Split between the two cities
\>  Hungarians don't do that petty inter-city rivalry
I mean, noting close to Manchester vs
Liverpool, but it's not uncommon even for neighboring villages
There are smaller rivalries such as Sopron vs Győr but nothing significant
Read carefully what I wrote: as a clearly superior Budapester, I don't give a rat's ass what the vidéki people do
...aaand both are vidék, therefore no one (that matters) cares
:D See where I'm going with this
I don't know why you are talking about the capital of Romania
As Hungarian doesn't really have dialects (it does have them, but sadly, not many people speak them anymore), dialects in the English language are usually dubbed using some weird, obsolete slang to get closer to it
Not quite an animated movie, but quite interesting:
In the last James Bond movie, there is a character who speaks German in the English version
In the German dubbing, the character speaks Hungarian, voiced by an actress from Northern Transylvania
Inside Hungary our dialects dont really differ from eachother, so it feels like we dont even have different dialects
But with hungarians who live outside of today's Hungary its's a little bit harder to understand eachother
For example Transylvanians have a weird accent
There aren't many, only a few, for example near our Northern Middle Mountains (sorry I don't know for sure if this is the English version of "Északi középhegység") but it's not THAT different from the official language
But those Hungarians who live in Transilvania
When we talk with each other, I nearly can't understand them
Especially the csángós
Yes, I only know like one grammatical difference which makes me able to tell if someone is from the western or eastern part of Hungary, and like 5 expressions that we use differently
I don't think we have different accents, but Hungarians who live outside the borders do have a little different accent, probably because the country they live in and the language influenced them
It's the same with some words they use, they use some different words, but really not much, also because of the influence of the other language
The older generation also has some of their own words and expressions that are different in different parts of the country, but only the old people use them, it almost entirely died in the younger generation
I wonder why we don't have dialects, in which era did they make it disappear
Also, why don't we use anymore the vocabulary of the older people
Maybe because they are too far away in another country so they developed differently
Are you talking about transylvanian romanians
Just cuz i was talking about transylvanian hungarians
Since i was talking about hungarian dialects
I dont know romanian dialects obviously
Bruh
Its okay
I just dont speak romanian since i dont live in romania lol
Yeah
As you said its probably because of different nations living next to eachother
Tell this to Mr
Orbán
So can I eat french fries in Belgium
Wilhelm II rattled his saber ever since the 1890s. Him and by addition Germany created the international atmosphere, which allowed matters to escalate into a full-blown war in the first place
Therefore, I believe, the blame falls on them rightfully
Well an Anschluß is certanly *a solutiun* to that whole conundrum
Not the most elegant one, but hey
It was meant to be a joke, but thanks for the information
Danke
I'm self-taught in German, so I make mistakes like that sometimes
Also, I suck at der-die-das
Das ist immer schön zu hören
Ich schäme mich immer ein bißchen, wenn ich Leo wegen ein scheiß "der" aufmachen muss

Q.E.D. ;)
We had folklore classes in fifth grade
Schools could choose between that and drama
I like learning about my country's culture, but I didn't like the teacher
After WWI half of Komárom went to Slovakia because it was on the other bank of the Danube, but that's the only one I know of
Sátoraljaújhely
Very similar case but I think they were two different administrative units while Komárom was one town
Yep
It is the former railway station of Sátoraljaújhely, complete with a former industrial zone plus two farm complexes
Awarding the station to Czechoslovakia was deemed necessary, as it lay on the only railway connecting Kassa to Munkács
Now, if someone was to ask the reasons why Munkács was deemed to have been a true Czechoslovakian city at the time
and how it came to be a true Soviet city in only 25 years
or how it became a true Ukrainian city by 1991
:-)
Well on Google maps I can see Nagylak/Nadlac (near Serbia on the hungarian-romanian border) on both sides of the border so I guess it counts as one
Somebody had ran out of creativity in 1920 - but managed to come up with a patriotic name, nevertheless
It's not Cold War Berlin, I strongly assume, but don't have the time at the moment to look up details on local border crossings
The railway border crossing is listed as a functional border crossing in the legislation currently in force
I don't know anything more
The Hungarian revolution of 1848
In Hungary most view it as a just cause against an oppressive foreign dynasty which tried to assimilate minorities
Which is fair point, however a lot of Hungarians forgot that under the revolution we also tried to do the same with minorities within the Hungarian borders
Also from that period Croatians have a national hero called Josip Jelačić, who in Hungary is regarded as a kind of traitor who allied with the oppressive Habsburgs to take down the Hungarian revolution
Not just about who was there first but also about what nationality the land is
Like
(?)
Same goes with their ‘54 title :((
> Same goes for Slovakia
Not really, sane people don't debate Slovaks were here first
It's generally accepted by all sides that Croats and Slovaks were here before us but Serbs came later (fleeing the Ottomans)
This who came first debate is only between us and Romanians
We even have a legend about making a deal with your king Svatopluk for the lands
Our bone to pick with Slovakia mostly comes down to you getting a bit too generous of a deal after WWI and haven't exactly treated us well in the last 100 years
Haha well I wouldn’t say you didn’t deserve it - you won, and that’s it
We’re just bitter because we were sooo close :(
> It’s quite a shame honestly, since our nations have so much in common, it’s just that we kind of disregarded it for the last two centuries
Exactly, culturally Slovaks are one of the closest to us, sucks that recent times have turned us against each other
> That’s actually interesting, do you have a link to this legend
Couldn't find a direct link to this in English, so I'll copypaste it from a longass wikipedia page
It's called "legend of the white horse".
*The legend narrates that the Hungarians purchased their future homeland in the Carpathian Basin from Svatopluk for a white horse harnessed with gilded saddle and reins:*
Then [Kusid] came to the leader of the region who reigned after Attila and whose name was Zuatapolug, and saluted him in the name of his people [...]
On hearing this, Zuatapolug rejoiced greatly, for he thought that they were peasant people who would come and till his land; and so he dismissed the messenger graciously
[...] Then by a common resolve [the Hungarians] despatched the same messenger again to the said leader and sent to him for his land a big horse with a golden saddle adorned with the gold of Arabia and a golden bridle
Seeing it, the leader rejoiced all the more, thinking that they were sending gifts of homage in return for land
When therefore the messenger asked of him land, grass and water, he replied with a smile, "In return for the gift let them have as much as they desire
" [...] Then [the Hungarians] sent another messenger to the leader and this was the message which he delivered: "Arpad and his people say to you that you may no longer stay upon the land which they bought of you, for with the horse they bought your earth, with the bridle the grass, and with the saddle the water
And you, in your need and avarice, made to them a grant of land, grass and water
" When this message was delivered to the leader, he said with a smile: "Let them kill the horse with a wooden mallet, and throw the bridle on the field, and throw the golden saddle into the water of the Danube
" To which the messenger replied: "And what loss will that be to them, lord
If you kill the horse, you will give food for their dogs; if you throw the bridle on the field, their men will find the gold of the bridle when they mow the hay; if you throw the saddle into the Danube, their fishermen will lay out the gold of the saddle upon the bank and carry it home
If they have earth, grass and water, they have all
[source]
The gist of it is that the messenger asked for things that symbolize the territory (that small grant of earth, grass and water meant all the land and rivers he owned) so when he agreed to this seemingly insignificant symbolic gesture he actually sold his lands in exchange for a horse
So uhm, yeah
cunning and trickery is a big part of our folklore
It took a huge downturn - then came a little midget and pushed it even lower, but with lots of money this time
Np \^^

An old obsession of mine,
is to roll by tank through Romania
On a big Tiger tank,
holding grenades in both of our hands
Beautiful road to Giurgeu,

Well, to be fair, we aren’t the only ones around here who are sensitive
I guess pretty much every country around Hungary has a bone to pick with Hungary, and vice versa
Maybe we would be if we would understand a word of it
I play nations with unusual position or religion, or do something that's not historically accurate in the Extended Timeline mod
Reforming Babylon, spreading the Nabataean religion, remaining Hellenic as Rome, creating a druidist colonial empire as Ireland, etc
EU4: Hungary for patriotic reasons, Byzantium for the glory of Rome, Shimazu for the lulz and rebels for spectation
Vic2: Only played a few hours with Austria
I colonised Afghanistan, but it didn't end well
HOI4: Hungary to restore Austria-Hungary, Spain to restore the Spanish Empire, Japan to improve my island hopping skills, Poland to see how long I can last and Cuba to spectate
Wow, CK2 is way harder for me than EU4
*Jászfelsőszentgyörgy* it is
Though a lot of villages were administratively unified in the last 100 years, so the historical recorders, that don’t exist on their own anymore are: *Reformátuskovácsháza*, *Péliföldszentkereszt* and *Nemesboldogasszonyfa*.
According to the Internet, it is Jászfelsőszentgyörgy
Jászfelsőszentgyörgy (Jász Upper Saint George)
Historically, it used to be Alsórásztok és Felsőrásztok (Upper Rásztok and Lower Rásztok, now part of Liptovský Mikuláš, Slovakia), followed by Nyugotifelsőszombatfalva (Western Upper Saturday Village, now part of Sâmbăta de Sus, Romania)
The longest name in historical Hungary that still survives is Szépkenyerűszentmárton (Saint Martin With A Beautiful Bread, now Sânmartin, Romania)
Greetings from Hódmezővásárhely
Well, yeah, you are right
This is by characters, but if you go by letters, it’s not valid
What is the first city you will want to visit once travelling will be as easy and hassle free as before and why
Bilbao with Erasmus+
I hope it won't be cancelled, I am so excited
My grandpa's grave in Sümeg, Hungary
Other than that, we had a booked room in Ljubljana for April, which didn't happen, but I would like to go there when the pandemic ends (not just the lockdown, but the pandemic as well)
The Hague
Amazing city, and I've learnt some Dutch as well since my last visit, so I'm definitely looking forward to it
i live in Hungary, and have a picture of a Mongolian licence plate, that looked pretty cool
Kukac
It means "worm" or "maggot". I don't know why is it called that tho because it doesn't look like a worm to me
We call it "Kukac", which means "Maggot" or "Worm" because it looks like a long worm
Kukac is kind of a  light-hearted word, generally used by kids
We don't say "at" here, everyone refers to it as kukac, formal or not
In hungarian we call it”kukac” which means maggot or worm
Maybe the a part is the head and the rest is the tail
Or that's my thinking
Well you can call a dick kukac in Hungarian but it's rather informal and childish basically the equivilant of "peepee".
Yes
Poland
Austria, Germany, Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia, Slovenia, Czechia
Rest of Europe
China
Rest of Asia
Rest of the World
Poland, Croatia, Germany and Slovenia, y'all are cool
Sure, the list is roughly:
Germany
Austria
Ireland
Any EU country
The underdog
Germany, many hungarians cheer for the german  national team
Well, as I have an indigenous minority background, if there is no other aspect, I will support the country with stronger minority rights
But overall, I love Slovakians as well and would cheer for them if there was let's say a Brazil-Slovakian final
I've been there and everyone was very friendly, plus I feel sorry for them, can't really see a bright future for Macedonians, especially after Macron's refusal
The foreign exchange students looked a bit horrified, when i told them that by the time i arrive at the party i already had 5-6 shots and atleast just as many beers
I mean it’s not a real party if don’t „lay the foundation“ before arriving
But booze is cheaper at home
I hoped someone would mention Queen Valentina in the comments
Iconic
Also I like your username
Same thing will happen as with North Korea
A lot of talk and muscle flexing, a few rocks will be throw but everyone will remain in their corners
Wasn't that the point of declaring them a terrorist org in the first place
So they can circumvent the Congress when they need to
I guess that category was initially designed for fanatic boys with bombs, but this one was an official entity (from what I've gathered) of an internationally recognized state
Which is a very different flavour, even if their "job" is similar
I hope you're implying the US is the wolf in this analogy, my dear turtle
Yep
I'd rather be a healthy productive citizen than a sociopath
Russia
Everyone except Russia
Don't worry, you used to this, why would it change
With what
We don't have an army
We only have some Griffins which we let patrol in the Baltic states' airspace
The former
We do have some kind of Retro Milk Bar, but I'm not sure if it's still open
I don't think anyone thinks of them as such, and they're definitely not also tourist destinations like Polish milk bars, but we have lunch-only places called étkezdék. I think they started as worker lunch places in communist times for people who didn't work in a factory with its own canteen
They're fewer and father between these days, but they have a certain rustic charm: huge portions, generally a rotating menu, often you just tell them what you ordered when you leave instead of getting a bill, usually shared seating at tables
And obviously still cheap
Haven't been to one in years but now you've got me wanting to go :)
Szomorú vasárnap
People don't listen to it for long
I think you misunderstood the question
In Hungarian, I think he speaks completely normally, with the exception of some "unusual" phrases (e.g. swearing)
What do you call a cheat sheet in your language that you would typically use on a test
What does it mean
In Hungarian it's called a puska which means gun
Small correction: as OP has said we use the word "puska", but the direct translation is rifle not gun
it's very interesting, there's a Hungarian word salabakter (pron
šalabakter) that comes from the German word Schaarwachter, and means an old fashioned and aged man
it's very interesting, there's a Hungarian word salabakter (pron
šalabakter) that comes from the German word Schaarwachter, and means an old fashioned and aged man
Yeah 'puska' in Hungarian is the thing you smuggle in to exams and try to use it to cheat without the teachers knowing
You must have something like that
actually when I was in primary school we used to write the cheat-sheet onto the sole if our shoes
you just sat cross-legged and you could read it
In some dialects ficujka is a piece of small paper like a post-it note
I guess there's a correlation there
It seems like it's a German loan word in Transylvanian dialects of Hungarian and Romanian
It still amazes me how foreign the concept (as in cheating on exams) seems to be to you guys
Sounds like an awesome thing in this day and age
Expelled as in expelled from the school altogether without any opportunity to take the exam later or just from the exam
For us if they catch you cheating you will automatically fail the exam but you will be allowed to take it at a later time
Obviously they will watch you even more closely the next time
In my primary school the students were able to decide if they need a locker or not, and if so they had to pay for it, so not a lot of students had lockers
In secondary school we have no lockers, i belive it's not really common in other schools
Hungary - I'm going with mostly no, but I've seen schools where 3 to 5 students shared a locker for coats
No lockers
We always carry everything in backpacks
I went to 3 different schools in the course of my schoolkid life:
Grade 1-4: In the school where I went to these grades, everyone had 1 coat hanger and a shelf to place your dirty shoes + keep the shoes you wear in the classrooms
Since each class had their own room and every student their own desk, we kept books inside the desks
From grade 5 I recall seeing that they had lockers outside of the classrooms, but they were on a different floor and I rarely went there, so I'm not sure
Grade 5-8: Different school, here we had small lockers at the back of the classrooms and coat hangers outside, on the wall of the corridor
We had to move around for different courses and other classes came to our room as well, so we were advised not to leave anything in the desks
From grade 9 classes were in another building, there they had bigger lockers on the corridors and the coat hangers were inside the classrooms
Grade 9-12: Switched schools again
No coat hangers, but the corridors were full of lockers so we kept everything in them
We usually carried our coats around and just put them on the chair we sat on
Books, PE equipment and anything and everything else were kept in the lockers
Now I must remark that I was lucky enough to attend better than average schools, so this might not be true for all Hungarian schools
In my school we do, but that is not the norm around the country
It is more of an exeption
Hungary - some schools do, but most don't, I guess
The ones I went to had bigger lockers for the whole class, usually 2 or 3 lockers for one class (20-35 students) just outside of your main classroom and they were used for storing coats and gym bags (and for little kids, like 10 year olds and under, shoes they switch into in colder months), and other stuff that you'd bring home in the evening (like huge art folders some arts students used)
Either it didn't have a lock at all (super safe, lol), or it had and everyone who used that one specific locker had a copy of the key
Storing books in these was pretty much forbidden, but some people tried, anyway, at least the most rarely used books
Yes, we had to carry our books all the time, yes, I have bad posture indeed
In older school buildings that don't have these lockers/wardrobes they usually have an area in each classroom to hang your coats and maybe some shelves to store other stuff
You don’t have lockers
I never heard of a higyschool (középiskola) not having it
Of primary schools i have no clue, mine had one for everyone
I know nothing of primary schools in general, i never heard of a secondary school/középiskola not having them
I always had one
It seemd so natural, i never thought that it’s not the case everywhere
In secondary school/középiskola
Lmao it seems like our secondary school is less bourgey than your one
To be fair i live in a smaller town so that can be the reason
I shared one with 5 others in primary school, and didn’t have any in secondary (we had hangers in the classroom but not lockers)
I guess mine was the exception
How can I get a Hungarian tag
10⁶ millió
10⁹ milliárd
10¹² billió
10¹⁵ billiárd
It seems like all other european languages have the same system, but am i the only one that thinks the english system makes much more sense
Subreddit >> 3 dots on the right up >> change user flair (on phone)
Identical to Hungarian, milló and milliárd, respectively

Hungary has the oldest underground railway in continental Europe
The largest thermal cave system in the world is also located under Budapest
The city also has the highest number of thermal springs in the world
VAT is 27%, which is the highest in the world
We also had the biggest inflation ever recorded between 1945 and 1946
In 1944 the highest banknote value was 1000 pengő. In 1946 it was 10^20 pengő.
Our language is also kinda unique
Being poor with social inequality breeds desperate people
Funny how times have changed
Portugal means South-East-West now
Only weirdos do it, which makes me one of them I guess

Local busses usually have a closed driver's cabin, it would also be kind of awkward if you exit on the back door
Hell no
I dont care
I feel like its very easy to sort of manipulate what goes on the front page of Reddit, and the hatred towards China feels like is generated by a certain group or something
I understand the thing and I also feel like China is doing China things, and thats not good
But at the same time it makes me sick, I dont want to see this on r/all every single day
I just dont care that much
And its not just r/all
almost every thread, let it be on r/games, r/europe, even here, has a comment or two about China
It really does feel like the Soros-hatred in Hungary to me in a way
If there is a problem, of course its because of China
This
Using a gaming event to push your political views will most likely not be tolerated, it shouldn't come as a surprise
Blizzard just did what anyone could've predicted
Probably the same thing would've happened in any other similar case, China or HK got nothing to do with it
You can't just break the rules then play the martyr when you get punished
That being said they've handled this poorly and went a bit too far with the punishments
Oh this is good
This should be stickied somewhere
We dont have to go far to find similar cases in sports either, just in the World Cup there was quite a backlash about Armenian Swiss footballers showing the Armenian Eagle in the match against Serbia(? I think)
They got their fine aswell
These sort of things are just not supposed to be in a gaming event, from either side
>  "Every Voice Matters"
"Holocaust is a scam and Hillary Clinton is a lizard" - does this matter too
Don't be overdramatic
Besides, there's a time and place for everything and these things have no place at gaming events
No, Finland is the testicles and Sweden is the dick body

lol true
I've written here once that this is a running joke also for Hungary
It began when a very good humorist once said that "the form of state of Hungary (meaning the political system) is that of the Wiener Schnitzel".
Or another time "From the Kingdom of Hungary-formed Wiener Schnitzel I ate Transylvania off".
>Kaiserreich-Germany
You mean like in the game or historically
Yes and not hat hard as it seems at first sight
Why is that relevant
I can tell based on what kind of mistakes they make, a sentence structure error is a dead givaway
I'm not the best with accents, but I would probably still notice that too
Sometimes when Slavs speak English (especially someone who isn't fluent yet) they tend to omit articles, which I think is kinda cute, but it's also a dead giveaway
Usually it's really easy
However, you can take up on people's accents around you
For example I speak with, in my opinion, a strong Hungarian accent with a bit of British accent mixed it because I worked with Brits for a few years years
I have a Latvian friend whose accent is similar to the South African accent
If you are surrounded by one particular way of speaking, you will slowly speak that way unconsciously
Mostly yes, especially if they originally speak my language, because I can hear mistakes I would/did make
One of my biggest achievement in the English language was when I started using fewer and less correctly
Before that, I'd just use **less** with everything
You'd be surprised how many native English speakers use *would of*.
It absolutely makes my blood boil
It bothers me more than it should
We say “fűbe harap” which means “bit the grass” so the same as in German
We have that as well only we say “to smell the violet from underneath” (alulról szagolja az ibolyát)
We say "give in the key". Apparently this comes from an old practice, when  a person living in an apartment came home last, they gave in the key of the gate to the concierge
Our language, architecture, and our torn up history are an unique combination to us I think
We're the biggest non-Indo-European language on the continent
Ahh, those pastries
I made pasteis de nata once and it was amazing
Definitely gonna make some again soon
No, Hungary has carbonated water too

Wait, what
In which way are we different other than the language
Yeah, and we're the only ones going backwards in time
Which building do you think is unique enough
But man, c'mon it's basically cheating if your country has one of the best internet in the world
Parlament
And thats about it
It's listed on the [Gothic revival] page so it's not that original
It's still the largest circus only for clowns, so that's something
The only unique thing about the Parliament is that I can't believe that it's taller than the SOTE tower

Only thing going for them
We didn't invent the style but the building is certainly unique
Romanian does not even has a longest word on this wikipedia page
How sad
DO SOMETHING
Not really (something along the line that you cant make someone to savoy cabagge) just an example how the word length is unlimited in agglutinative languages
[More examples]
Megszentségteleníthetetlen would be a standard, useful word, and it means something which cannot be desecrated
Szótárilag "Megszentségtelenít". (In a dictionary)
No worries, Japanese suffers even shorter longest words
Just imagine that the finns can do the german and the hungarian tricks

I'm 21, being that partner for my bf
We were in the same year in high school and now attend the same university
I am currently living with him in his mother's nest
We have been together for 5 years, I moved in half a year ago (if they shut down everything due to covid, I'd rather be stuck with him than without)
His mom considers me family so there was no issue there
Sexy time works mostly by doing it late at night
On those rare occasions when we have the house for ourselves for more than a day, we might do it earlier
Definitely do it less often than we would if it was just the two of us, but we can make do
We have our own room in the house
I'd say that most people in the country are ok with their adult kids bringing home people as long as they act sensible (keeping the volume down, not making a mess, using protection etc
i'm 18 and all my friends are and it wasn't ever an issue
everybody has boy/girlfriends, they bring them home and have sex, we all go to uni but still live with parents
idk if i should say despite or because we all have pretty solid family background
as long as you have your own room with a door that can be shut, parents who respect that and you commit to not being loud, it's all good
Something has to be said about bit having walls made out of paper
And ofc
the lack of religious nutjobbery with the "my house aint no brothel
" is also likely playing a part
&#x200B;
If you think about it the US nuclear family model is the "new/less natural" of the two
As for the WAST majority of history extended families tended to live together, if for nothign else, then for practicality
If you haave some urgent or unexpected thing to do you can ask granny to keep an eye on the kids
Similarly if granny needs babysitting due to being reaaaaaly old, well, its much easier if she lives with you
I would say that the US model is the result of its religious nonsense, and its 'Murican dream hybridizing - so instead of religious idiocy calming down, the solution became "find your own house".
or take a bike
We have "Himnusz" (means Anthem)
It's really sad, and slow, so if a non-hungarian would hear it they'd say it's boring
Or more like that we are in a great depression of some sorts, which is false
It really sounds like something they would play at a funeral
I really like that it's not like a victory march or such like other countries' anthems
We actually are sad, our history and our future is rather dark, we don't have very much to hope for
You should add that it was written in the beginning of the 19th century (by Ferenc Kölcsey); but its style is even intentionally older to avoid censorship, so that Habsburg officials couldn't say it was complaining about the contemporary system
And also the music of Béni Egressy tries to mirror that
It was made to sound like that after the world war
It sounded a bit more upbeat before that
I have always thought that “Szózat” would be a better anthem, because it has a very nice tune and also the lyrics are more patriotic
But aren't we depressed
5% of us are, the highest in Europe
Yeah, but that's not the offical anthem
There you go:
Unfortunately Kölcsey did really good marketing by literally naming his writing "Anthem". So changing to "Szózat" would be weird, I think
Well, you got me there, but our anthem is still way too sad for us
Szózat - Magyarország nemzeti himnusza
It might be weird at first glance but we would get used to it over time
The anthem was made by the older ones, they were depressed
I think
We only have one, the Himnusz
Szózat is like Nemzeti Dal: they're important writing in Hungarian history, but not anthem
I think because we lost almost all of our precious lands filled with several minerals, our country was controlled by another countries , and we lost all our wars serveral times before
At least this is what all the boomers tall about

Deep frying at home is a mistake
Same thing in Hungary
It should be nokedliszaggató  a dumpling maker, likely to be found in neighbouring countries, too; or the box for milk that came in plastic sacks
and let's not forget the match boxes filled with beads/pearls
had it, used it, quite practical, not easy to clean
I bought a Belgian-made deep fryer half a year ago
It's ridiculous how much better it is compared to the large international brands you can get everywhere, even though it looks totally flimsy
My fried foods consumption has pretty mich tripled, lol
It not the same as far as I know
My mum works in Austria and she always takes some with herself after visiting
It's either not the same quality or there isn't that much place where you can find the original abroad
kocsi, it means car but sounds childish compared to autó
I noticed that Hungarian colleagues use "the" in front of nouns more often when taking about software
Example: "I opened the Outlook" instead of "I opened Outlook".
Funny, because the Slavic languages (Czech-Slovak and Croatian) I more or less know (not speak
) don't even have (definite) articles
That word order exists in other languages, too, actually - "piros nagy labda" sounds really weird in Hungarian, it should always be "nagy piros labda".
(It's the exact same example as yours)
From a linguistic standpoint, it is present tense
Present perfect actually
"I have worked here for 2 years
" is the correct way
It is in the present tense but in a perfect aspect
Grammatical tense, mood and aspect are all different
Look it up if you want to
That sentence was more readable and understandable than it would have been without commas
You gotta admit that makes no fucking sense
If it's fifty pounds, why isn't it fifty quids
I heard it enough from Englishmen that I don't make this mistake but it still makes no sense
To err is human
You mean like they talk like teenagers
"I was like huh and then he was like duuh"
If it's any consolation, you would put an article there if you were to say the same sentence in Hungarian
It generally is free
But some combinations sound better than others
It's not incorrect in either English or Hungarian to say "red big ball". It just sounds odd
Similarly, you can say "főztem ebédet neked" and it's absolutely correct - but most Hungarians, in most contexts, would say, "főztem neked ebédet" (it means I've cooked lunch for you)
I usually say when asked that the word order is free, but has significance
Just like you said about Finnish- how interesting
I would use the first one like here:
- Which big ball you need
- The red big ball
I don't think that this makes learning Hungarian or Finnish easier
Understandable
It's not a very useful language to learn anyway
Even in Serbia
German is harder and doesn't make any sense
No surprise
"Deciding".
Careful with that word

Core part of our cousine from everyday dishes to holiday food
We use it for sweet pastries and poppy pasta
I was actually mind blown when I realised that opium comes from poppy
Why on earth you would put it on pasta is still beyond me
The childhood scars are still on me
>The fields are guarded by military police tho
Seems a tad bit extreme
Here plenty of grannies grow it in theior own backyard, so that they can make the perfect bejgli pastry for christmas
But it's soo good
You just need to add some baracklekvár to it and then it's uwu
...why did it scar you
Alkaloida Zrt
at Tiszavasvári is/used to be a major producer of pharmaceutical morphine derivatives and had significant controlled plantations
Memories of awful food in the school canteen
Use the recipe with the most heavy cream in the dough and the one that proofs the rolls overnight, in the cold
Add a dash of lemon (including the zest) to the poppy, and raisins too, if you like them
The weight of the individual rolls should be around 50/50 dough/filling ratio, otherwise they will rip lengthwise
Pozsonyi kifli is the same pastry, if you'd like some extra work
...i agree with you on that
However mákos tészta was one of the few things they couldn't reliably fuck up, the worst they could do was to barely give any poppy seed with it - which ofc
they did

It's _uborkaszezon_ in Hungary, the exact same expression
Do you have any language games like Pig Latin in your language
I show you two examples from Hungarian to see what I'm asking about
- "Bird language". If you speak this language, you have to put into every original syllable a letter "v" and then repeat the original vowel
Example:
"Tudsz így beszélni
" - in Bird Language: "Tuvudsz ívígy beveszévélnivi
"Can you speak like this
" - in Bird Language: "Cavan youvou speaveak livike thivis
- "Eszperente". Name comes from Esperanto, in this case you must speak with normal words which mean anything (so no gibberish or made up words), but they mustn't contain any vowel other than "e". This shows how over-represented the letter "e" is in Hungarian, because you couldn't do this with any other vowel
Foreigners often say who don't speak Hungarian that it sounds like a goat bleating to them
Example from wikipedia (I didn't want to find out something new): _Étterem - Kellemetes hely, melyben kedvedre ehetsz eleget, ellenben e nevezetes helyen teljes keresetedet elverheted
_ ("Restaurant - A pleasant place where you can eat all you want, but you may spend all your income at this place at once
That just sounds like drunk Dutch
We also have similar
_Fenn a falon, fenn a falon van egy kicsi bolha_
_Fenn a falon, fenn a falon van egy kicsi bolha_
_Nézd a kicsi bolhát, hogy járja a polkát!_
_Fenn a falon, fenn a falon van egy kicsi bolha
(Up on the wall, up on the wall, there's a little flea 2x Look at the little flea how it dances the polka (flea (bolha) rhymes to polka); up on the wall, up on the wall there's a little flea)
And you have to sing this song similarly, with one vowel at a time, like _Fönn ö fölön, fönn ö fölön vön ögy köcsö bölhö_ etc
Btw, now I realised where our word _patak_ for brook comes from
Do people often speak Welsh in everyday life
I like these universal cultural constants
Like I thought only our family kept the sewing kit in a Danish butter cookies box

And I think children who play this would have a better language intelligence, maybe they could learn foreign languages more easily
But that's just my theory

The event: Trianon
Reason:   B   I   G    Hungary
A typical Hungarian would say the treaty of trianon that gave 2/3 of the country’s territories to other countries, but what I think is that 40 years of socialism
It held us back for decades and it really changed the way we think(not in a good wat)
This is easy
Delete the treaty of Trianon or if thats impossible, i would make it a fair treaty
So transylvania and all the other land where Hungarians live would be not detached
Im pretty sure everything east of germany-austria was occupied by the Red Army
Similiarly to the others, Czechoszlovakia didnt have real choice in 1945-1948
When did that happen
Lol we beat your ass in 2016(no offense)
Same bro, same :/
Would not have been occupied/torn in three for 150 years

Yep, I think about like 70% agrees, 30% says I don't like politics and I don't wanna get involved or something like that
The [betyárs] come to mind
The most known one is [Sándor Rózsa ]
We have [betyárs] 18th-19th century outlaws whose existence stemmed from the social and economic upheaval of post-Ottoman wars Hungary
We also have the horse-herdmen, the [csikós] And our literal cowboys, the cattle-herdsmen [gulyás] after whom the food Goulash got its name
[Hajdú] also has a bit of a different meaning than in South Slavic countries where it’s also used as Hajduk
It was originally used for part-time marauders, part-time soldiers for hire that gained prominence in the Turkish wars
But in the early 17th century the princes of Transylvania settled them around Debrecen, giving them special privileges and autonomy
So hajdú is also a name of Hungarian sub-ethnic group
By the 18th-19th centuries hajdú also became the name for a sort of feudal police
They are seen as kind of “reverse-sheriffs”. Not the righteous guns of justice, but the cruel enforcers of the nobility’s likes and wishes
And last but not least, there are the [kuruc] the anti-Habsburg insurgents of the 17th-18th centuries
Halo, Salut
Ah yes, the historical inspiration for Guts, the main character of Berserk
it originated from Hungary, and I came here to post the same thing
Hajdú was the Hungarian name for cattle herders
i thought of the same thing
maybe even 'kuruc'?
This was an awesome summary, köszi
hajdús were also literal cowboys, they were gunned cattle-herdsmen
Same in Hungarian, we also have ‘hajdú’s, and it’s also a last name in Hungary, quite a frequent one at that
I don't think most people here know much about it
It's probably mentioned in passing in history class, but that's it
Hungary lost the Vojvodina, a part of Slovenia, southern slovakia,carpathian ruthenia, Northern Transylvania
And the local communist party cheated in the elections with the assist of the soviet occupation forces (example the communist party members had a card wich they could vote 6 times) the communist party won the elections with maybe 32 % and Mátyás Rákosi was the leader of the Hungarian Socialist Republic
Ghana was a colony of the united kingdom

There are tree planing programs going on, but they seem to be either local-government run or volunteer
For example, the 10,000 Trees for Budapest program, but that's city-run
It started in 2016 and is supposed to be finished this year with the planned 10,000
I haven't heard of anything nationwide, but we do need more trees
There’s [Unicum] it has a very particular, almost medicinal taste (well it is a digestif)
Some people love it, some hate it
I never really liked it that much to begin with, and since a few unfortunate experiences I can’t stand it
[Pálinka] is a popularly homebrewed fruit brandy
I’m not necessarily the biggest fan, but there’s a huge range of quality regarding it
It can go from undrinkable bleach to amazing fruity spirit
Since they legalized large-scale home distillation there are ton of random people who make not so good produce and like to force everyone to taste it
[St
Hubertus] is a bit of a “Hungarian Jägermeister copy”. It’s lower-quality, but has a taste generally considered somewhat more pleasant than Jäger (I think
I haven’t tasted in a long-time, so I don’t recall it that much
Other Hungarian users feel free to correct me)
Pálinka
Sometimes tastes like bleach
But it also can taste nice
In Hungary it has to be Pálinka, its like Vodka, but Pálinka
In Slovakia i dont really know
Palinka
Tastes like the fruit it's made out of if made well, and if not
it's probably closer to dirt
Ours is Pálinka, which is a very strong, fruity drink
I think gin tonic is great
Specifically everyone has an uncle, husband, friend or father who makes pálinka and it's (at least according to them) the best
There are also 8M other Hungarians who have a different supplier and obviously theirs is best
Safe to say it's mostly undrinkable swill, but spend enough time here and you'll find someone's that you like and be indoctrinated into the 'well yeah, it can be quite bad, but you should try Csaba'a...' crowd
I used to drink Hubertus in my youth (like 18-20 yo), and sometime the cheaper substitute _Vadászkeserű_ ("Hunters' bitter liqueur")
Whenever I remember the taste, I almost throw up
It comes in many more variants, basically from every fruit or plant you can make jam, you can make pálinka as well
But it's not our national drink
It's Pálinka
A lekvárból is Pálinkát!
tbh the home made is good,at least the one i usually drink
I know lol, i was just saying that i like gin tonic
A nickname I heard for Unicum is "gömbkóla" (spherical cola) specifically because of the bottle
Aren't you supposed to drink it like vodka
Either you are, or I'm drinking vodka the wrong way
Ah, I see
The problem is it's been a long time since I've drunk good pálinka
I think its pretty easy compared to other languages like German and French
The only difficult thing is that you hear a lot of different English arround you
So, take me for example: i speak a British-american mixed English with either an american or an eastern-european accent
Also, i make the mistake many times to use Hungarian grammatical rules when speaking English because it sounds better imo
So, its easy to learn good enough so people can understand you, but you may make a lot of mistakes
I don't think so
My spoken English is terrible, mostly because I basically never use it, but I consume all of my media in English
Also, I never search for anything that is not specific to Hungary in Hungarian
So basically, I use it daily
I make lots of mistakes (especially using he/him instead of she/her, since gendered pronouns are not a thing in Hungarian), but when I read/hear/write English, I don't translate to/from Hungarian in my head, I just think in English, and I achieved that point without formally studying it
I took a few classes in university (1
5-3 hours a week for about 30 weeks total through multiple semesters) to practice actually speaking a bit, because here in Hungary you must have an intermediate or higher level language exam to get your diploma (I think you need 2 now), but by then, I knew enough to don't actually learn anytihing new and just used the classes as practice
German on the other hand
I studied it in elementary and highschool, for I believe a total of 9 years
In highschool I had something like 7-8 German classes a week
I even had to pass a German exam at the end of highschool (equivalent to the American SAT's I guess), which was marked just below an A, which in turn would have given me an intermediate language exam in German
That was about 10 years ago
Nowadays I don't speak a word in German
Granted, I hated it and I didn't put in any effort outside of sitting in on classes and studying for specific tests
I don't know why, English just made sense to me and I learned it by trying to communicate in online games, then watching TV series with Hungarian subtitles
Then after a while I got good enough and impatient enough to not wait for Hungarian subtitles to be released and switched to English subtitles
Nowadays I still use english subtitles when watching series/movies, but honestly, I have no idea why, since I listen to plenty of podcasts and watch a fair amount of youtube without any trouble
It's just a habit at this point
I actually prefer English to Hungarian, which, if I didn't learn naturally due to being born here, I wouldn't even touch with a ten foot pole
So in short, no, I don't think English is hard at all
At least not on the every day, conversational level
Nah
Compared to my primary language it is a piece of cake
Even if your teachers are bad you can still teach yourself english just by consuming huge ammounts of Media in English
"Yeah, I am totally interested in the culture and I definitely don't just want an easy way to get an EU passport so I can go to tourist locations in Western Europe hassle-free

It's exhausting to contend with these people
>but many of us have problems with gypsies' actions and lifestyle, not their ethnicity
Plenty of racists in the US would say the same thing about black people
That's a debatable statement, both the explicit and implicit part of it
Gypsies in our neck of the woods in Central/Eastern Europe aren't "travellers" as they are seen in Western Europe
They are generally poor(er) people living in the shittier parts of cities and countries, having lots of children
Nothing unique about that
English - Hungarian
Vienna - Bécs
Munich - München
Bratislava - Pozsony
Cologne - Köln
Warszawa - Varsó
Cluj-Napoca - Kolozsvár
Leipzig - Lipcse
Not Europe:
Beijing - Peking
Most cities within old Hungary but outside current Hungary have distinct Hungarian names, which vastly differ from the names used in modern English
An easy example is Pozsony - Bratislava
On another note, Vienna is also called differently here
It's Bécs
Edit: Another notable example is Venice - Velence
Bratislava is Pozsony (that is probably because the english name came after the hungarian)
It would be a more amusing question for German names as historically Central-Europe had a bigger German population
Like Fünfkirchen is not really similar to Pécs
Or the Slovak town Poprad amusingly called Deutschendorf
Budapest to begin with
Letter s in Hungarian always sounds "sh" so the right pronunciation would be "budapesht".
Knowing what pest means in English the wrong pronunciation just gives extra fuel to the joke line of being asked if you are hungry when claiming what country are you from
This happened to me in England and well, not the expected English politeness to be honest
Vienna=Bécs
And most cities in the neighboring countries
Bratislava - Pozsony
Trnava - Nagyszombat
Nové Zámky - Érsekújvár
Vienna - Bécs
Novi Sad - Újvidék
Rijeka - Fiume
Zadar - Zára
Cologne - Köln
Dresden - Drezda
Nice - Nizza
Saint Petersburg - Szentpétervár (though it's a literal translation)
Rostov-on-Don - Don menti Rosztov
Venice - Velence (we also have a town called Velence in Hungary, so it can be confusing)
Florence - Firenze
Naples - Nápoly
Brussels - Brüsszel
And many Russian city names are Magyarized, as the following:
Nizhny Novgorod - Nyizsnyij Novgorod
Krasnoyarsk - Krasznojarszk
Novosibirsk - Novoszibirszk
Bryansk - Brjanszk
Vladivostok - Vlagyivosztok
Vyazma - Vjazma
Vienna / Bècs , this is the only one that really ckmes to mind
>Kodaň - Copenhagen
why
In Hungarian it's the same thing, we call it Bécs
I quickly looked it up on wikipedia to find its ethimology and this is what I got:
>Körmendi Ferenc szerint a város magyar neve avar eredetű: becs jelentése őrzőhely
[3] Kiss Lajos szerint az ómagyar „bécs” (szénégető kemence) szóból származik, ami a maga részéről egy régi török nyelvű, azonos jelentésű szó átvétele volt
[4]
So basically it means either "guarded place" or "coal burning furnace" and it has an Avar or a Turkic root
Same for us
Hungary - Magyarország
And
Florence - Firenze
Wrocław's Hungarian name is Boroszló, which comes from the German variant obviously, but even weirder as Hungarian tends to insert vowels
>But everyone does get very creative with their pronunciations of Ljubljana
Can't go wrong with Laibach
And what is Latvia
And Banat
And even the rest of Romania
(We have a unique Hungarian name for most Romanian cities
Iaşi - Jászvásár
Roman - Románvásár
Yeah the hungarian language is pretty weird
The regions where Bratislava and Cluj-Napoca are, used to be the part of Hungary so Pozsony and Kolozsvár is understandable
München and Köln were adapted from the time when Habsburgs ruled Hungary I guess
About why Vienna is called Bécs I have no idea though
Yes, Pressburg, Pozsony and Bratislava are names for the same city
yeah okay, but Copenhagen ist a bit further away
Hungary, Ungarn, Hongrie, Hungria, etc
all come from the Latin word Ungrii, which is how we were called when we came to Europe
We on the other hand, call ourselves Magyar, while ország means country, so Magyarország literally means country of the Hungarians
As per Wikipedia, it's either Avar or Turkish in origin
One of our comrades also mentions it above, and if I remember correctly Serbian and Croatian use a word with the same origin
Which, now that I think of it, is just one language
Edit: Peking used to be used in other languages too, but at some point, the Chinese government asked people to please start referring to the city properly
Similarly to how Ivory Coast is now  Côte d'Ivoire
Makes sense
Only Google Maps and Waze, as far as I know
There's iGo Navigation, but that's mostly just built into cars
Some of my hiker friends use a special map app that can display elevation and hiking trails, but I forgot its name
[mapy
cz] is actually awesome for hiking, I have used it several times too
That's two continents worth of people though, way too broad of a demonym to use anyway
Like if there was a country called Eurasia, would I care if only they were called Eurasians, even though I'm from the continent of Eurasia
Of course not, I still have European, Eastern European, etc
just as you still have Latin American, Central American and whatnot
They were the first ones to be called that, and are the most prominent country in the Americas, so it's fairly reasonable to call them Americans
1 huf doesn't really exist, 10 huf can buy you a small candy (smallest ever), and 100 huf is two eggs
1 liter of milk costs around 200 huf
1 Forint: nothing, even our smallest value coin is 5F
10 Forint: nothing
100 Forint: like 2 boxes of matches
At around ~300 you could get a bar of chocolate
1 forint = nothing
10 forint = a paper bag
100 forint = 2 bottle of water
We cannot buy anything for 1 or 10 HUF
The cheapest thing I can think of is a bun, which you can get for 20 HUF
100 HUF - a cheap bottle of water
1 HUF ≈ 0
3 Euro cents
1 forint coin doesn't exist anymore
10 forint means nearly nothing
100 forint is enough for a round in a public toilet or a shopping cart
Sport szelet, Balaton
Small sour candies cost around 10 Ft
Why'd you want to buy weed
Just go to the side of the road eks dee
For me, it's the other way around, it's so easy to spend so much of my money in euro, because you know, 20-40 euro doesn't seem like it's much, it's only in the tens you know
Then I do the math in my head and holy shit, I'm surprised half of the time
200 + ÁFA
It's a quite old currency, the '90s weren't too kind with it, neither is the current government
He didnt mean that cheaper meat is sketchy
He meant thatvthe price is for stuff like free range chickens, ethical farming ...etc
basically 1 step above "its meat" kind of meat, in terms of taste, but still well under luxury meats
I mean 0
3 (3/10) cents, 0
003 Euros
> ÁFA
VAT, for anyone wondering
It was in 1946, the largest denomination was [one hundred million bilpengő]  it is 10^20 pengős
And after that fiasco forint was introduced as a currency, with some gold backing
> I visited Hungary in 1983 and I remember an official exchange rate of something like 15 HUF = 1 NLG
Yeah government really screwed up in the 90s. They couldn't figure out how capitalism worked other than "sell every asset of the state for pennies = good". Crazy inflation is one of the side effects of their amazing work
The government is profiteering from inflation, and wages around 500€ (or much less) would be noticeably low, there would be international and national consequences for not raising them
Always cursive, and most teachers even punish those who write in printed in elementary
In highschool, this is less pronounced though
We didnt learn it in Hungary
They taught us cursive only in elementary school, and never printed letters
We learned cursive but now I'm writing printed
Why tf would you write in printed letters
Sure, if I had to write by hand often, I'd prefer cursive too
That said, I don't find that being able to write really fast with my hands is a useful skill at all
Not in this digital age
To answer the question, we not only learned how to write in cursive, it was required
In elementary and highschool, if you didn't write your paper with cursive, they automatically failed you, regardless of the subject
Back then, laptops were a very rare thing (as in, not a thing at all for personal use at home), most of my classmates didn't even had a PC or Internet at home, and smartphones or tablets (or smart boards in school) weren't a thing at all though, so it made sense
Everything was written on paper
Circumstances change though
Right now, I think it's a waste of time
To be fair, I thought the vast majority of school material was a waste of time, from elementary school up to my CS degree
As for cursive specifically, most people won't really write anything on paper in their day to day life, and when they do, it's usually just filling out forms with basic information
I'd prefer those to be easily readable
What are the most common scams that can threaten tourists in your country
In Hungary, Budapest we have the following things:
\- People blocking the public transportation ticket machine inside with a sticker
Once you have left they go back to take your returning coins/tickets or passes, which they sell for other tourists
Never buy tickets from strangers on the street
\- The well known "Romanian deaf mafia". They can't speak Hungarian but they pretend like they can't speak any other languages as well until you call the police
They usually put a turtle toy in front of you in restaurants/trains, then come back a few minutes later to collect the money from generous people
\- Some girls in the 7th district are in contract with pubs
They are trying to seduce you, to make you invite them for a drink, so the place can charge you for an incredibly overpriced drink
\- People coming to you to ask you to sign something which will help them protect someone
(usually ill children) After you sign, they ask you how much would you like to donate
It's also a scam, feel free to ask for their license
\- Edit: Taxi drivers as well, as written in the comments
Taxi drivers should be at the top of your list
Never trust them, use an app if necessary to show you the shortest route to your destination
But then I'm apparently not allowed to brew my own either
Please stop this ageism, it's their youthful spirit that counts in this line of business
Never had a serious encounter with pickpockets in Italy while in Barcelona there was a menacing amount of them (and these were just the ones I could spot)
I ended up very visibly carrying a cheap wallet as decoy with minimal cash while the rest and the credit card were in a money belt
Well yeah as for tourists the travel insurance with unlimited coverage costs like 10-20% more so it would be a foolish thing not to go for it
They start demanding money after they have tightly wrapped it around your wrist
ima just stick to my fish sticks when it comes to seafood
I find it disgusting, but becouse of how intelligent octopuses are
The idea is disturbing in the same way, as killing and eating an other human
As a Hungarian, I have only eaten octopus once, when I was on vacation in Greece
All I can say is I'm not a fan
But I don't think of it as weird or anything
I also don't freak out over people eating dogs and cats
What makes dogs, octopuses and cows different
Nothing, one culture eats one, other culture eats the other
I believe most Hungarians wouldn't even try it, very unusual, I personally would try it
Hungarian here
I love octopus salad, but would eat it in any form
Absolutely amazing
Borsod (Borsod Abaúj-Zemplén county) = Mordor
The whole country tbh
For extra fun, it's usually abbreviated as "BAZ megye" (megye=county), which sounds really close to "bazmeg" - "fuck you".
Borsod a sorsod
(Borsod is your destiny)
Az sorsod Borsod te kulturálatlan
I lived there for 4 years so I guess the question in my case is if I would return or not
I probably wouldn't because of my son
Don't get me wrong, as a healthy, middle / upper middle class dual-earner couple without kids NY was great
There are tons of amazing restaurants, museums, exhibitions, it was easy to visit other parts of the US and the Caribbean etc
I liked my job, I was employed by a non-profit so we weren't working ourselves to death by American standards and my colleagues were fantastic
I found Americans really easy to befriend and I still keep in touch with 6-7 of them
However, when my wife became pregnant we looked into giving birth and raising a child in the US and we immediately decided to move back to Europe
Our priorities changed and the whole system became way less attractive: the healthcare system sucks even with a good insurance (not the treatment itself but the constant haggling with the hospital and the insurance company), schools were often either insanely expensive or bad, buying good quality food ingredients was often an effort, Manhattan has a great public transportation system IF you don't have stroller with you, employers don't give you enough holidays, etc
etc
So for the next 18-21 years I can see ourselves moving around in Europe but not to the US
Doesnt matter, i beleive they would turn me back at the border because i am an atheist
A lot of European countries are different in Hungarian
For example: Lengyelország - Poland, Németország - Germany, Olaszország - Italy, Oroszország - Russia, Horvátország - Croatia, Magyarország - Hungary
Croatia-Horvátország
> Netherlands -> Hollandia, also formerly: Németalföld (German Plain)
It's more like the closest we have to the expression _Low Countries_. Btw, Németalföld isn't necessarily the modern Netherlands
> Fun fact there is no ország(country) in country names outside of Europe
I haven't realized this until now
Wow
Well, Törökország has a small portion in Europe
Hungarians also use -ia suffix for countries:
Demark-Dánia
Norway-Norvégia
Portugal-Portugália
England-Anglia
Scotland-Skócia
You're right
Österreich —> Ostern reich —> “east” reich
So eastern empire, provinces
Lithuania- Litvánia
There's a second hand clothes shop, that's called "TÚRVAJÓ" ("best if found"-ish), which is just one letter away from "KURVA JÓ" ("Fucking great")
Needless to say, it gets CONSTANTLY corrected for the latter
This has spawned a lot of content and articles too
The [Nemzeti dal] titled quite literally 'National song'. It was written by Sándor Petőfi  for the revolution of 1848
He is considered one of the biggest poems in the history of Hungary
There's a street named after him in almost every town
It was also the first poem I ever memorized in kindergarten
>in kindergarten
I'm sorry, what
The things I memorized in kindergarten were about little cute animals, nature and childish games
Or to write something more comparable to the Divine Comedy, I would say either János Vitéz or Toldi are more fitting answers for this question
i wish i could say i disagree
it's kinda lame that this is basically national anthem no
2, there's so much variety in hungarian poetry yet these are the ones that everyone knows by heart
also add 'Alföld' to this list
Yep, me too, but I learnt the first verse of this one too
Walesi Bárdok
Bro, we got one of our kings killed by a boar
We all have a fear of boars in Hungary
Haha
and a side for duck and geese aswell
*Német-római Birodalom* (German-Roman Empire) or *Német-római Császárság* (German-Roman “Emperordom/Kaiserdom”)
Archaically *Szent Római Birodalom* (lit
Holy Roman Empire) also exists, but not really used anymore
Német-Római Birodalom/Császárság
German-Roman Empire
Both Birodalom and Császárság mean Empire, and both can be used when referring to the HRE
The most common way to refer to it is "German-Roman Empire"(Német-Római Birodalom), but very rarely you can find the "Holy Roman Empire"(Szent Római Birodalom) version too
[ we had it for German scientific words because they didn't exist in Hungarian (and to make the language fancier)
English doesn't see the same thing
:) We just try to write the words we can with Hungarian phonetics
However, we have a lot of loanwords from Slavic, Turkic, Persian languages, and we don't hate them, they've been in the language for very long time
(some over 1000 years)
Sadly not, as far as I know, but I would like to have one
how did they come up with those words
>Removal of loanwords has actually been fairly successful in Korean in the past
A lot of Japanese loanwords were incorporated into Korean during Japanese occupation
Same in Hungarian, except for ones from German
Indeed it is
But so is the word for school (iskola), axe (balta, Turkish), eggplant (padlizsán, Turkish)
Many words concerning buildings come from German, and kept their original form, like lichthof, speiz, etc
In the 18-19th century there was a movement to invent new words either to replace loanwords or just have something for a new invention
Tanár (teacher) is tanítás+árasztó (someone who flows knowledge), mozdony (train engine) is something that moves, rovar=rovátkolt barom is an animal that has a cuts on its back
Most people probably wouldn't notice now that these are invented words
There were also many unsuccessful tries that were ridiculed at the time, like foltos nyakorján (spotted neck-thingy, giraffe), and words that were used at a time but died out, like éleny (life-thingy, oxygen), or villámdelejes forgany (lightning-magical rotating thingy, electric engine)
Even though I'm already at quite an advanced level of English, one thing I still mix up in my speech sometimes is the gender of personal pronouns
Referring to a man as "she" and vice versa has gotten me into some awkward situations
The cause is simple; in Hungarian, personal pronouns are not gendered, it is just "ő" (and its conjugated forms, of course)
Also, hate to be that guy, but uh
with English being your native tongue, looks like you also mix up some words, since in the title, it is not "who's" but "whose". :P
Viktor Orbán. :(
No joke:
The t-shirt says: "living god".
It reminds me the old Hofi joke: "What's the difference between Orbán and God
God doesn't want to be Viktor Orbán
My favorite recent(?) meme is when she was waiting for god to create the universe
Well yes, unfortunately, this proportion is >50% in Hungary
And how much they love each other
Like from Bolsonaro through Orbán to Duterte
We've been lacking of luck for ten years
The Mary-cult had a strong tradition in Hungary too
Partially, the reason for it was the prior existence of a paganic mother-figure deity
The two characters eventually merged in folk culture, thus parts of the old beliefs survived in the form of the worship of Mary
It really isn't. More like ~20-30%, which is still a lot, but not that bad as you wrote
Didn't she direct one of the episodes in Planet Earth 2
Sorry, I count the indifferent als supporter, too, because they are the backbone of the regime
Who never vote, who say "I don't care, all politicians are bad" etc
They are as important, as the fidesz-zombies
> Even many of their voters have objections but have even more objections against the alternative
Well, they are then worse than the original zombies, because they pretend to have a brain, but they don't.
"So YoU lOvE gYuRcSáNy
ReMeMbEr ThE nOkIa BoXeS
44négy" is their counter-argument if somebody confronts them
Well said
Yeah, I'm the harmful one
This is like when Fidesz-média weeps that the fascist Karácsony also governs the city as a dictator in the state of danger
Brühühü, after 10 years of fidesz, this is what Zoltán Lomniczi and Gábor G. Fodor are sad for
> ensuring that tribalism
Well yeah
They told me that I'm the traitor of the nation so many times, that I have believed it
I don't consider myself in the same nation as the vast majority of the Hungarians
I know that Orbán will reign here until his death, and I reserve my right to resent all the people supporting this
Some hungarians still think they are superiour to others
Labant Csaba refused his son's K-vitamin vaccine
The kid vomited, like, really hard
A nurse tried to respirate him, but the father and his wife tried to stop her, because they said, they can't respirate a not even one year old child
The kid died
Labant Csaba got arrested by murder, I guess
On the court it turned out he's a flat earther as well
That was around a year ago, and he still in trial
He tried to blame anyone
The nurse, the police, the hospital
He said, they wanted his kid for his ORGANS
Also, he's the dangerous idiot
Hungary has too many
The main flat earther once was went to the Hungarian Academy to presentation
He said everyone was interested and liked this theory
He was on the Pschihology department
I mean, we lost Transylvania in WW1, people are still salty
There's also the Partium
And the genocide against/expulsion of Hungarians after WW2
Slovakia was always more alien and Croatia was never officially part of Hungary, just the crown
Transylvania on the other hand is a deeply respected and historically rich region wich has been a part of Greater Hungary since the time of the Árpád's.
Croatia was a separate state that *mysteriously* \- wink-wink, nudge-nudge - happened to be governed by Hungary since the 12th century
No significant Hungarian population was ceded and the new border generally followed historical borders, therefore there is (and was) no hostility
They also came to realize rather quickly that the Great Union of South Slavic Peoples belongs to those ideas that are much nicer in theory than in practice, so there's a justified 'we told you so' feeling on our side
Those are, too, but they are the most salty over Transylvania
Yea and there are people on the internet who thinks the treaty expires in 2020
The Vojvodina one during 1944/45
Yes, absolutely
And don't even try to ask for advice on, say, r/legaladvice or r/personalfinance of you aren't American
No point
When I posted in r/legaladvice they literally couldn't help me because I'm from Hungary
> it's totally normal in the US to regularly go to church even if you're otherwise normal
Otherwise normal :D I love that phrasing, can relate entirely
And seriously, what is it with their obsession with pop culture
Incredibly exhausting
I'll take Americacentrism for 200 please
There is one
Its called r/carsEU
It was originally to make ourselves a separate thread but it didnt really got big
Share it and we can make a nice little thread there
But you do have the highest rates of teenage pregnancy among developed countries, even if it's decreasing
I understand and agree with all that but still, dozens and dozens of comments consisting of nothing but pop-culture quotes that add nothing to the actual discussion
incredibly frustrating and it happens in pretty much every 'light-hearted' reddit thread
A lot of Americans seem to have the idea that culture = race
Their idea of diversity is very much racially charged and a lot of them cannot seem to handle the idea that a Hungarian is very different to an Englishman, or that Romania and Sweden are quite different places with different history and culture
They say “many languages means many different people”. And that is true I believe
When speaking English, I somehow obey a very “American” way of saying stuff (thanks to all the influence by the internet and pop culture)
Hungarian only uses intonation on entire sentences (for example to indicate a question or an exclamation) while English uses it word-by-word
I also feel more modest when speaking French, and my voice pitch is higher
Same
I have a very deep voice but my English is straight up girly
I can relate to this
I have an easier time to talk about feelings or form opinion in English too
My English personality is much less reserved lol
My best friend (Same native language) and I almost exclusively text in English- we picked up this habit because it was much easier to talk about certain things that way, and it continued to be a habit
Sometimes i wish more friends of mine would be willing to do something similar, id have a much easier time to open up, but oh well
Nah, when I speak Hungarian I have to open it more
Nah, Hungarian is one of the most openly articulated languages out there
I start slurring my speech more when I'm speaking English
I don't know how to put it, but I feel we have more 'rounded' or 'open' wovels
I dunno about the throat thing
We use hard R, no TH, no W and the word-stress is always on the first syllable of a word
Manual labour can pay better then a job that requires education
For instance, my current boss told me that in Budapest assisting labourers won't even consider the job below 15 000 HUF per day (~43 EUR)
That comes our to around 330 000 HUF per month (~938 EUR), or even higher depending on what the deal is
Not bad for someting that you don't even need any formal education to do, let alone a degree
Gas man
(Hungary) you can earn literally billions
I wish I was joking
On average people take home around 200 000 - 250 000 HUF (~596 - 710 EUR) depending on where they live, iirc
Hey, that 9,35€/h is not that bad
In Hungary you can find people to work for as low as 1,5-2€/h.
Depends where you go really
For instance there are places in Budapest where you can get a beer for what amounts to about 1 or less then 1 EUR and some other places where it's 3 EUR
Ofc I have no idea what places you visted exactly but those frequented by tourists, such as most of the central disticts are usually more expensive
But yeah, all in all, the wages are pretty low around here sadly
There is a reason Hungarians call London the second biggest Hungarian city
Budapest: modern, annoying people, too much gypsys
Miskolc: incest, crime, cool buildings
Debrecen: nice church, modern
Eger: nice wine, old buildings
Pécs: huge university
those are the ones off of the top of my head
A balkan EU extension, more countries joining schengen and  the eurozone
East and west's development differences will be hardly seen
Investing in lesser developed nations in the world
And i hope we will be the greatest vanguard of peace
Yes im optimistic
Well I'm not British but I live here for 7 years now so to my understanding, old people tend to view it in a positive way while young people don't really care about it
People moved around a lot in the last few centuries so it's a bad indicator, but any family name ending with in -i or -y denotes their place of origin
-i  for commonfolk and -y for nobility
Győri (someone from the city of Győr), Szilágyi (someone from the county of Szilágy), etc
Names like these are quite common
Old, localized ethnic groups also work
Tóth (someone from today's Slovakia), Palóc (a group of people in Nógrád county), Székely (a group of people in Transylvania), and so forth
Not sure if this is the answer you're looking for, but I don't think there are other telltale signs in Hungarian that someone is from a certain location
if you meet someone with the surname Hugyecz, he/she is most likely from Nógrád county or Vác district of Pest county
If a meet someone with that name I start to laugh bc the name sounds funny as fuck
Can I tell you a funny story
I live in Germany now but need to go back to Hungary for a weekend soon
The govt there closed the border for foreigners and expats but with many exceptions
I do not belong to any of those exceptions and plan only to visit very short, but even then I should go straight to a 2 weeks quarantine which I can shorten with 2 negative tests taken 48 hours apart
That´s way too long a complicated to me so I do the following:
I land on an airport close to the border and call a guy I know, who does a border commute every day and has Hungarian plates
He picks me up at the airport and smuggels me into Hungary
He says I should look like a worker who just finished his shift and it´ll be fine
Pretty fucking hilarious
Just like in the 1950´s, but the other way around
To answer you question: yes I still plan to go back to Hungary for good
Yeah, we got those people in Hungary as well
"If you don't like it here, then leave
\*person leaves\*
"Oh you left, you traitor
Don't ever come back here
You are not Hungarian anymore
Echmiadzin is not only a beautiful place but the center of the Armenian Church, really worth a visit, it´s quite extraorinary

Who would have expected something like this
The trains, and the buildings
We're still using some of the things the communists built, and it's kind of sad, but nostalgic at the same time
Also the classrooms of schools in the countryside
They're still using those dark green wooden blackboards
[Tatra KT8D5 trams]
When I was a kid, these trams were used in my hometown, but since 2014 they were replaced with Škoda trams, and most of the old Tatras were sold in Prague, only a few remained which run seasonally
This, combined with the Tatra trams is the ultimate nostalgia trip for me
We used this as the goal when playing football :D
That's great
As far as I'm concerned Corona isn't even an issue in North Korea, right
No it didn't so it was kind of an extra line of defense, but I remember that once, while trying to save a goal, the ball hit my hand and knocked it onto the bottom bar and it broke my thumb
How do you commemorate WW2
We don't and didn't use the "Czech Republic" form except official documents
It was always "Csehország" (Czechland, the country of czechs)
There is no word in Hungarian for "Czechia", like "Csehia" or something
In hungarian we call it Csehország ( Czech Country) instead of Cseh köztársaság (Czech Republic)
The last one sounds way too offical and Csehország takes less time to say or write
If I speak English I'd say Czechia (if I knew how to pronounce it)
Czech Republic is again, just too long and sounds too offical to fit a normal conversation
In Slovakia we are used to "Česká republika" I never even heard "Čechia", in hungarian its "Csehország"
Oh, yes that is also an option
[This is] the right answer
Our most unique flag for sure
I really like the simple red-white squared croat pattern
Simple, recognizable and relatively unique
Those uncreative bastards
The thing you said about the crown
OMG do you like it too
That crown is just awesome
In hungary there are no dialects
Only Székely People(Hungarian minority) in Romania or Hungarians in felföld (Slovakia) speak a different a bit different than others
Correct me if Im wrong
Hungarian dialects are almost the same, and today "standard Hungarian" is mostly spoken
Hungarians across the border are still having stronger dialects
The only Hungarian dialect that is very, very different is Northern Moldavian Csángó, but not to many people speaking it anymore
Budapest - everything
Debrecen - agriculture, pharma, (automotive)
Szeged - food
Miskolc, Győr - machinery, automotive
Székesfehérvár - tech, electronics
Dunaújváros - metallurgy
Despite the fact that a Hungarian, Karikó Katalin is the vice president of BioNTech, we still mostly call it Pfizer-vaccine lol
pfizer
and they also mention katalin karikó a lot since she's hungarian and played a pretty big role in developing the vaccines
Köszönöm.
Děkuju
Mulțumesc
Thank you

Hungarian, English, German, French, Croatian (meaning probably a few others as well
), Spanish, Slovak (not sure about the spelling of the last one)
> Koszonom (I think at least two 'o's had umlauts)
Actually, all three: Köszönöm.
Here I am
Wanna talk
:-D
No, thank you is "köszönöm". However, Merci can be a nickname for someone called Mercédesz or slang for the car Mercedes (mercis - someone with a Mercedes car)
We also have the chocolate brand Merci
Their Formula 1 track
Captain Jack Sparrow
Nothing bruh
I made a presentation about Sweden in High School and we had to speak firs about some broad facts than dwell into an important industry/agricultural/service industry branch of the country
First I wanted to do IKEA, but I read during the preparation for the broader facts part that Sweden has very high iron quality and I fell into that hole
I pretty enjoyed reading about the history and future of this industry, even though I had to do the presentation in German
The most important Hungarian artifact (for around the past 800+ years) is the Holy Crown of Hungary, there is a whole lore and an almost religion-cult like following of  that crown
It's scary, funny and for some reason I can understand it
Just look at it
They's fabulous, they's... They's... Beutyfull
They's **precious
We also call them frankfurti
We have a kings too
1000 FT - Matthias the Just, you probably heard about him, he was co-king of Bohemia after the "Hussite king"'s death
10000 FT - Saint Stephan or for reformed church people Stephan I. Well kinda the most important guy in all of Hungarian history
He created the County System that is still standing in Hungary
In Transdanubia the county borders didn't even change that much, what I find really really interesting
We also had Carl I on the 200 Ft note, but the paper money was changed to coin
He was replaced by a bridge with chains
We too
Why would we do that
We are already raking in [all the medals in men's water polo] and [most of canoeing too]
It would be [teqball] for Hungary
It was created a few years ago so noone else really plays it
Teqball but only because we invented it
:) Also close second would be making "moonshine" or pálinka:)
You guys have no chance
You'd have some fierce competition there
>Swearing
As if you would stand a chance
How about hobbyhorseing
Combine the two and create a new sport
I heard about the guy who's legally dead
No taxes tho
Oh, us Hungarians are notorious complainers as well, we're in
You're asking the wrong questions
Can you be arrested for murder if you're legally dead
In hungary we have "magyar kétfarkú kutya párt "
Which means "hungarian two-tailed dog party" (raw translation) and it started as a joke but they now have a few representatives in the council
the hungarian two tailed dog party
actually less weird than the gov
party
We have this party called Fidesz, it's led by a little known guy called Viktor Orbán. It's pretty weird and also real sadly
Fun facts about them include a fondness for stealing and a disdain for democracy
Years ago Hungary wanted to organize the 2024 olympics and they said If the game took place in Budapest They would import ancient greek ruins
They also want to marilize legajuana
This:  . When the national television gratiously offered five minutes for all other parties to introduce their program, they appeared in a chicken suit clucking
Later it turned out he was clucking their main program (infinite life, free beer) in Morse and ASCII code
Campaigning for free beer and immortality
More than two-thirds of them, so they can do pretty much whatever they want
It wouldn't help at all
Russia has a bicameral legislature and Putin still wields all the influence
It's pretty much the same here, Orbán emulates Putin in a lot of way
Hard to say
By European standards, I guess the UK is big already, but by world standards, the only big countries in Europe are France, Ukraine and ofcourse Russia
In terms of population and size, I's say Romania
Never even heard from them
I usually take trains in Austria and they do have them, it's pretty great actually
I don't know about Hungary though, probably not
Budapest
I just love it, it's so different from every other bigger Hungarian city
Székesfehérvár, basically it is a very old city where most of our kings were crowned and burried, it has a beauiful architecture, culture and history
My city
Every other city can suck dick
Especially in futball
I mean I like basically every city in Transylvania
It has a unique feeling to it, that I don't experience anywhere else
Not even in Hungary
The Steiger beer factory actually operates there, isn't it
Hungarian meme culture is very cool over at r/FostTalicska
100% prefer it over international, we even have quite a lot of our own meme templates
Hungary
It mostly consists of making fun of people who are not the smartest, people with a different dialect, or just generally different than others and so on
Writing English words phonetically seems to be hilarious
We like to make fun of ourselves
But mostly they just translate already famous ones from English and use it as their own
Oh and they can get very political, but thats not just Hungary
Overall it's not bad, kinda funny sometimes
Rich
Well, it's different here in Hungary
We have our own things, most of which are very different from english memes, but the community is generally very creative
We have our own terms (basically just literally translating every word from english) like 'én_avé' meaning 'me_irl' and so on
The memes are very funny, mostly politics related in some way, but i love it
And the community is pretty big, considering most people haven't even heard about reddit in Hungary
But in other ways, we do kinda resemble the English meme culture, in a way that we repeat the same jokes over and over, there are very cringeworthy "memes" as well
We aren't proud those, obviously
So, yes, i like it in general
I wont even talk about instagram meme "creators", because they just steal from r/Fosttalicska (respect to the exceptions, of course)
We got r/fosttalicska which is quite a dank sub
Sub name literally means diarrhea wheelbarrow
rendben, csecsemőrobbantó
+pirosarany
szóval mindegy, én elkezdtem robbantgatni
Town in the rural regions of Hungary
As a joke we use it as an Alabama replacement
As an advanced physics student at the time, visiting the nuclear power plant and its museum was one interesting trip
Also one of the guys in my year managed to break the simulator of how to change the graphite (?)
Another one has to be the time we went to Recsk as advanced history students
It's a labor camp from the early '50s, holding political prisoners
We've been there in early March and the weather was absolutely terrible — mud and near freezing which still probably was a fraction of the horrible things the prisoners endured
These were half a day trips/just a couple hours but I went to caves twice
The kind where you need to wear overalls and hard hats not the walk-in kind of easy access ones and it was so much fun, we still bring them up sometimes
And it was a three day trip but since it was scheduled past the school year (instead of mid-May), only 10 out of 35 went to my first high school trip so we just chilled at an aqua park after a bit of hiking + rowboats and a visit to an easy access cave
And then the next day we went to explore the city (we've been at a farm thing) but it was raining so my friend and I just went to a shopping mall, directed there on phone by her stepfather who used to live there
We got a 4 years lasting catchphrase from that trip, lol
We went to a wildlife park and there was a huge ass  zipline
Others were SUPER lame
The only nuclear power plant of the country was exciting
2nd best was the local confectionery factory where we could eat anything we wanted
But that wasn't a regular school trip, the owner's son was our classmate
We had sex ed first in 5th grade with an outside professional (but as I heard it, this is quite unusual)
And then we had our regular sex ed in 6th and 8th grade at biology class
Depends on whether or not you're attractive
Same, 5th grade by the district's doctor
We are friends with poles, not that outlandish, but unusual
As I know they are basically Jewish jokes
During the communist era, right after WW2 making fun of Jewish people was prohibited, for these types of jokes you could have gotten a sentence to death
So we changed Jewish people to Scottish people because they are far away, we don't know anything about them, and we have no problems with them
> despite being on the opposite sides of the war, our countries were still friendly towards each other
Supplying the Warsaw uprising by repeatedly ordering our troops to charge at the Polish forces only to retreat, leaving our equipment behind for the rebels to use must've been a hilarious yet wholesome maneuver to partake in
Another thing happened in WW2, that Germans wanted to use Hungarian railways in the invasion of Poland, but the goverment didn't allow that, because of our friendship
And Poles also contributed to the revolution of 1956, because it started as a solidarity protest to the Poles
In Europe yes, but our closest relatives are the Mansis and Khantis
It's only my opinion, but I think it's really sad that we don't know much about our language relatives, and we don't really care about them
Even, you can also find Hungarians, who deny the fact, that Hungarian is Uralic language, and there are a lot of alternative theories about which are the relatives of Hungarian language
It's actually Khanty and Mansi that are the most closely related
I'm half Hungarian half Romanian, but I've only ever lived in Hungary, and I only speak Hungarian
So I obviously feel a stronger connection to Hungary
We'd be more than happy to have you in /r/hungary, you can write your comments in English that's no biggie and having another perspective is always welcome
It's a pro EU echo chamber, but sometimes peeps go too far regarding the grass being always greener on the other side
Yes, mainly Harghita and Covasna counties, as well as Cluj-Napoca, Oradea and Braşov
Yes
Very different
The way they say E /ɛ/ sounds a lot like Á /aː/ and they have a whole bunch of unique words we don't know
Their pronunciation doesn't make it harder to understand them, their unique vocabulary does
But then again, there are more dialects in Hungary, however, it's really hard to tell where somewhere is from based on their pronunciation alone
(Except for Szeged, which has an infamous dialect)
In Szeged for example, instead of E /ɛ/ many say Ö /ø/.
~~accidentally not inviting the hungarain embassy as a negotiating partner to the treaty of trianon~~
When in 1896 the Austrians introduced weighted universal male suffrage, the traditional balance of power in the Reichsrat ceased to exist
When Count von Badeni, Austrian PM tried to appeal to the Young Czech Party to gain their support in a coalition, he introduced a language reform in the administration of Bohemia and Moravia
This reform made both German and Czech the administrative language in all of these two crownlands, which enraged the mostly monolingual German population
Thus began an era of parliementary disfuctionism in Austria
Why did it matter
Well, the fact, that the Austrian Reichsrat could barely pass any legislative decisions in this time period made it rather difficult to pass the new decennial economic and financial agreements with Hungary
The result of this was the so called Ischl Clause, bywhich Hungary onesidedly lengthened the current deal
The problem with this was, that now the Hungarian parliement was in disarray, since they viewed the decision as a surrender of the country's rights
Heavy obstructionism began, which made the parliement unable to accept the annual budget for 1902 in time
This resulted in riots in Croatia, among other problems
When the then Hungarian PM, Tisza István forcefully broke down the opposition's obstructions, it created a controversy so great, that in the next election the Anti-Ausgleich Hungarian nationalist united opposition won
There's still more to this story, but things more or less settled only after 1908
To conclude:
-Relations with the Austrians suffered
-Relations with the nationalities suffered
-Meanwhile the military budget stagnated
And the Great War was right around the corner
Nah but fr i cant really think of anything rn
Thank you for helping out my sleepy brain that cant think of anything
I've learned that English speaking people never ever respond with just one word
Responding with just yes or no is very rude, you have to say something like "yes, I am", "no, it's not".
Also, that Fraulein is very commonly used in the German language
I had to learn a lot of devices people don't use anymore (or use very rarely) and names of places don't existing anymore (and sometimes I didn't even know what they were)
It's been same with English and Russian
I started learning Russian last September
In my Russian book, characters sometimes still go to disco, using CDs and DVDs (and never heard about pendrive or cloud) and altough they sometimes write e-mails, they still write handwritten letters and postcards
I  also remember, in English class, we had a text about the characters going to video library (honestly, I don't remember the correct name, but it's the place where you can borrow videos) and none of my classmates knew what it is
It was around the mid 2010s. Another thing with English, we were taught about "be going to" and we were made to use it very often
Later, I realized, "be going to" is not very commonly said, only when someone wants to emphasize something
Otherwise present countinous, "will", or "gonna" are used
Lucky you, we had to learn half a page about a winter Olympics or some other sports event (I can't remember) in Garmisch-Partenkirchen
>Responding with just yes or no is very rude, you have to say something like "yes, I am", "no, it's not".
I remember that, too
We've also learnt it that way
My memories came back, when we had to cram stupid texts in French
Not texts and phrases we might have used in the future, not
We had to learn by heart a story about a couple having a first date and the man propose the women, meaningless dialogs (and talking to ourselves) and things like that
I'm so thankful I finished high school and I don't have to suffer in French class anymore
Of course, I get it
It also identifies women by their marital status, which is also a bit outdated, especially if you don't have the same word for men
What I meant was that in every high school German language book it was used way too frequently, and it gave the impression that it's a super common word even today
I was a high schooler 10-15 years ago, maybe today they moved on and updated them
We have the same in Hungarian (probably originating from Austria):
- asszony = Frau
- kisasszony = Fräulein (literally: "little Frau")
I like the Hungarian names of neighbouring countries' cities way better usually than their version of it
Idk why, I guess it reminds me that those places were once part of Hungarian history, so they shouldn't be lost
Pozsony - Bratislava, Nagyvárad - Oradea, Temesvár - Timisoara, Szabadka - Subotica, etc
I might get hate for it, but I prefer those versions
"vár" is castle in those names
I like the Hungarian names very much
As far as I know, no current Hungarian city has an English name
My hometown szombathely translates to Saturday place
Trá mhór is such a pretty place . Love to visit it again .
I agree
They are usually just mimicking the Hungarian pronunciation or translating the meaning literally
(Of course, there are exceptions
The German name for the city doesn't come from war dein (was yours) it comes from the Hungarian word, várad
The nagy part in the Hungarian name means big (Nagyvárad)
Most of our Hungarian Great Plains (creative naming i know), there are many small villages it that region with the population of <100
If you ask someone from Budapest, anywhere that isn't Budapest
And even Dublin feels like that from here
If you don't need it, why did you take it away from us
(joking)
[Actually, the plains generally have larger settlements with bigger space in between than the hilly areas]
Especially the Neusiedlersee
Hmmm good to know I am from this area so I was generally biassed
Also I think "middle of nowhere" isn't just how big it is but also its relevance
In which case Békéscsaba wins, there's nothing there and even bearly
This is a little misleading, since there used to be a large "tanyavilág" ("hamlet world") at some places like around Kecskemét which weren't consisted of incorporated settlements but still very much inhabited
Hey, more respect for the Viharsarok please
Don't diss my hometown
^((that I don't plan returning to)
It's the second most peaceful city in the county
Right after Békés.
This is the joke that only Hungarians get
Hey I love there, I have right to talk shit about my home village (which I spend about 4 days a month)
No, only Csaba is peaceful there
Impossible
FBI open up
It’s something like FBI nyissa ki, I guess but it doesn’t sound cool
It’s pretty cool though that you learnt it as a non native

Eggs no
milk yes (If not UHT
UHT I only refrigerated after opening)
Ofcourse they go in the fridge
It keeps them edible and drinkable way longer
It is expected, they will almost always ask you if you want them to wrap it up for you
Its uncommon due to portion sizes at most places
However noone cares, you already paid for if, so if you want to take it with you, well its yours, do with it as you please
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
The only place where i could see people caring is snobs in high end fine dining places, who go there with the goal of falunting wealth, as opposed to enjoying the food, but other than them its not something tbat anyone would remember
Not at all
Maybe some top-level places, but in most restaurants it's absolutely OK to take home the leftovers, although they might have a small fee for the packaging
There are some places that are proud of their enormous portions, where it's even kinda expected that you don't eat it all
[QWERTZ with öüóúőűáéí] (all "normal", separate keys), but most importantly, the 0 is in the correct place (0123456789)

Good old 13 and 1/2 lifes of Cäpt’n Blaubär. The favourite of my childhood
Gotta love Walter Moers
Lol, we do that in Hungary as well
Unless it's a very formal, stuck-up situation we blow it as hard as it goes
In Hungary we've had a "this doesn't make sense" moment for 1021 years now, and we're perfectly fine with it
Brother is a lil based ngl
Why does he do it though
Yeah, they tried that shit here in Hungary too
It wasn't long lived
It was reverted after a year or so
First of all, it's ridiculous to begin with if you think about it even for a minute
The monday-friday workweek is not really a thing anymore
Also, it reduces the total hours of operation by a significant amount, which will end up hurting the employees either by causing them to work less hours and get paid less or work the same amount of hours which leads to stores being overstaffed and people losing their jobs
Absolutely fucking moronic
Secondly, everyone started abusing the rule
All of the employees of smaller stores ended up being part-owners of the stores
Only on paper of course
Poor brother
&#x200B;
Do you get something like prius if you go to jail to sit your debt
Jesus
That sounds like a nightmare situation
Pushed the country into civil war, then offered most of the country to the Ottoman Sultan on a silver plate
It's also speculated, that he was intentionally late to the battle, where the previous king died
I'm talking about Szapolyai János aka John Zápolya
The party compiled a list of the poorest people and at elections they send out people to give them a dozen eggs and a bag of pasta in the name of the party
After that they offer buses to get them to the polling stations
Hungary Is a small country so there aren't many accents and it's very rare that someone speaks in a completely different tone (and if so, it's almost always the older people) - it's rather about the words they use (but just a few words) or the different declination of verbs, nouns
Sometimes people coming from different parts of Hungary can have a very good time playing "do you know the word ....... ?" - but those words are not from everyday life
However the Hungarian living in Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, etc
can have really noticable dialects
I think only the ignorant and poshy ones look down on people who don't speak the "standard" Hungarian, for the most of us it can be interesting, maybe sometimes a bit funny, but not in a mean way
Hungarians who live in the east( Hajdu-Bihar, Szabolcs) or who live in the west (Vas) have pretty noticable accents
Most Romani people also have noticable accents (which I don’t have a problem with but is pretty straightforward) and indeed, Hungarian in surrounding countries is spoken a bit differently
Nobody gives a fuck
Unless you are speaking to yourself, it's not
No, is it a thing in the US
I could not imagine that, sounds like something from a totalitarian regime
Anything that can come close is private investigators who inform the police of the whereabouts of fugitives and collect the reward
They don't have more rights or powers than any civilian
Sort of, they are in theory just debt collectors but for some extra money they will probably do anything, what you ask for
>Bunch of dumbfucks with little to no education who were too stupid to become police officers
Behind the iron courtain police officers were not famous for their intellect
The role was mostly filled by people who wanted to retire early and were too dumb for much else
We even got a saying
*postman,, police officer, railroad worker - stupid, stupider & the most stupid*
That's not exactly how that saying goes: it's "stupid, stupider, stupidest, postman, policeman, railwayman" - it's meant to say that these occupations area higher grade of stupid than what the adjective itself allows to express
Sure, I meant the part that big guys from god-knows-where knock on your door looking for you
Yeah, I realised I used the wrong word
What I meant really is just that idea of big guys knocking on the door to get you what feel a little bit like communist times
>untrained, and occasionally unlicensed individuals arresting criminals for payment from a private company
Take out private company and put in Government financed and there it is a moment from a communist nation
There is just surprisingly little difference between thugs of opressive regimes (like in fascist Italy) knocking on your door, to help out a company that is supported by the state
And ptivats thugs directly paid by companies (instead of "being on good terms" with leaders of the regime) knocking on your door
&#x200B;
I get that the latter is good moral free capitalism, and the othef is evil opression, but if you are on the receiving end its pretty hard to tell thedifference
Yes
...however i fail to see the practical difference between US during the coal wars, and fascist Italy
Sure there were philosophical differences, but at the end of the day striking workers got machine gunned down just the same
there's this food called kőrözött, that is a spicy cottage cheese kinda spread
it is made of túró (which is a type of fresh cheese curd or quark, kinda like bryndza in neighbouring countries, but more sweet), sour cream, onions, caraway seed powder, red paprika powder, black pepper powder and salt
it's definitely worth a try
> tyrokafteri
oh, very interesting
i've found this discussion on the topic
We have 8 World Heritage sites:
* Hollókő, a village in northern Hungary
* Budapest, the capital city
* the cave system in Aggtelek (shared with )
* Pannonhalma Abbey
* Hortobágy National Park in the Great Hungarian Plain
* early Christian necropolis in Pécs
* Lake Fertő/Neusiedl (shared with )
* Tokaj wine region
EDIT: This really doesn't deserve an award
I just looked it up on Wikipedia
All of them worth a visit
It is not just a little village
It is a *traditional* little village
I've been there a couple times and it's actually quite fascinating
*The Old Village of Hollókő is an outstanding example of a deliberately preserved traditional settlement, representative of a culture that has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change
This village, which developed mainly during the 18th and 19th centuries, not only represents the Palócz subgroup within the Hungarian nation but also bears witness, for the whole of Central Europe, to the traditional forms of rural life which were generally abolished by the agricultural revolution in the 20th century
*The property includes the most important elements and components of the village and the surrounding landscape: the deliberately preserved traditional settlement, the farmed land belonging to it, the wider landscape and the natural environment with all its character-shaping elements
The traditional settlement and its landscape environment, shaped by land-use, which includes features such as strip-style farming and wooded pastures, together with the castle ruins that organise and orient the landscape's panorama, form a harmonious and intact entity in its visual appearance
There are two main types of Fisherman's soup (halászlé, sweetwater fish chunks in a paprika and onions flavoured stew): the Szeged and Baja varieties named for two towns on the Tisza and the Danube respectively
The Szeged variety contains finely crushed small fish parts and bones mixed into the soup as well which makes it creamier, and is eaten with large chunks of bread
The Baja variety doesn't contain the small parts
They also cook a special type of pasta for it in a different pan in water, then serve first the soup with the pasta in it, then as a second dish the soup with the fish chunks in it
A terrible overcomplication of the perfect Szeged variety
So, what is the correct answer
I prefer sweetened (only make/buy milk based and not the plant stuff)
Then I raise you the superior one, Gesztenyés (chestnut)
Wait, there are people who use warm milk for their cereals
How is *that* acceptable in the first place
Also, it's not that big of a debate but whether sausage from Csaba or Gyula (manufacturing cities) is better
We have that dish, too
Meat's the best part
Anything, i hate people calling us hungry
Anything that they can't make "hungry" jokes about
*please stop*
Danubia, perhaps
Or Pannonia
Magyaria doesn't sound that bad
I'd go with writing it as something like Magharia or Magaria, or best of all Madyaria, which is how it should be written if good ol' Kazinczy didn't mess up that one too
> *Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of Saint Stephen*
I never heard/read someone from Hungary adding that "of Saint Stephen" bit
Did we ever actually use it
In Hungarian, Turkey is called _Törökország_ which is literally Turkland
"Po" in German means butt
Hungaria sounds pretty cool to me
I have a cool name for your country in mind, but I'm not sure you would like it
By any chance, did your great grandfather perhaps have Hungarian roots
Viktor with "k" is a very common name here
László isn’t a gypsy name by origin
It comes from the name of King Ladislaus I.
Although I have met plenty of gypsies names László...
László is a gypsy name
I'm pretty sure it ain't, and I've met a lot of László's in my life
I think its more like we rather wear clothes with subtle logos
Also Norway
I wouldn't say I had "romantic" views, but I was quite shocked to find such conservative people (Free Church people)
I did not expect to be judged for "living with a man outside marriage" (friend, not even boyfriend)
I know they're a small minority and I certainly don't judge the whole country by them, but I didn't think such beliefs existed in Europe north of about Greece
Also did not expect so much sexism in Finland
I hope those types are also a small minority
> Anti- and Pseudo-intellectualism are running rampant over here - especially tied but not limited to homeopathy

Except for the fact that people from Germany get news from 2 countries, while British people get them only from only one country
Man, i'm jealous
The train line that goes to Budapest through my city is one of the most used, and it was last upgraded (or repaired, i'm not sure) in the 1970s. The line is 60km, and it has a 40km/h restriction on most of it
With stops and other delays (wich we get a shit load of, thanks MÁV) the ride from one end (Lajosmizse) to the other (BP) is 2 hours
But hey, at least we have tons of football stadiums
My friend called them "Free Church" in English
I forgot the proper Norwegian name and now I can't find it, but my friend said it was *not* the main Norwegian Lutheran Church, and also that most people don't give a shit
No worries, it wasn't ruined, just made a little bit
weird
I met lots of nice people, the land is absolutely gorgeous, and fiskegrateng is excellent
In Norway, it was just bad luck
The man I lived with, long-time Norway resident, firmly assured me that the vast majority of Norwegians don’t care about who lives with whom (male, female, straight, gay, whatever), and it’s just the ultra-conservative Free Church people who care
That’s a small group
I mentioned this another time on Reddit and a Norwegian lady replied, saying please don’t judge Norway by them because they’re extremists
In Finland, yeah, Finnish women have told me the same thing
It’s a type I haven’t experienced elsewhere
And I was probably romanticizing the Nordics as a place with no sexism or homophobia
> Where in Norway were you
Right
It's completely WTF
I was in Oslo staying with a friend
Apparently the building he lived in had a lot of Free Church residents
Of course, they knew we were living together
He was just there because the rent was cheap
I would think
It's fairly normal most places I've been (which is mostly Eastern Europe)
I met them in real life, in Olso
I was staying with a friend who lived there and apparently the building he lived in had a lot of Free Church residents
Of course, they knew we were living together
He was just there because the rent was cheap
Geographically
I've only spent time in Central and Northern Finland
Otherwise, I'm over 40 and so are most people I know, so maybe it's mostly an "older man" problem
As for what countries are more or less sexist, there seem to be different types of of sexism
I’m used to men who think housework and cooking are for women or who make jokes about “women drivers”, but still respect us and don’t *really* think we’re less intelligent
And I'm probably blind to that kind
In Finland, it seems men agree housework isn't gendered, but *some* men also seem to think women are generally less competent at life, can't manage a household on their own, etc
That's really strange to me, so I notice it more than the "he never does housework" type
Doesn't that make an average European guy more well-versed in what's considered good than a British bloke
I mean if you have some perspective, you can compare the 2 things, while British people can't.
I think it was
I just wasn't sure because I looked up that term and didn't find anything specific (but I don't speak Norwegian, so that's probably why
Thanks
Fortunately it was mostly just a bad surprise
They didn't harass us or anything, so we just ignored them
Good to hear that it's not so common among younger people
Hopefully it's fading out
I've visited other Nordic countries, but mostly I've been in Eastern Europe (mostly south-east of Hungary) and the Middle East
I suppose it's mainly the *type* of sexism I've seen in Finland that's...unsettling
Wow, I found something on Wikipedia:
This is basically a list of surnames
Also available for other languages, replace "Polish" with chosen ethnicity
Hungarian surnames:
* job: e.g. Kovács (Smith), Szabó (Tailor), Halász (Fisher)
* ethnicity: e.g. Német(h) (German), Tót(h) (Slovak), Horvát(h) (Croatian) - the ones with h are the traditional spellings, also more common
* origin: place name + i
* given names as surnames
More info: [ Feel free to ask if you need help
Also, if a name ends with -i, it usually refers to a place
For example Budai is a common first name and it means "from Buda"
Oh right, how could I have forgotten - one of my surnames is a physical characteristic
:-D
Some more here:
Yeah, there are quite a lot of Slavic words in Hungarian, and vice versa
Also, not on the list, but I know "papucs" is the same in Croatian
No, my own country scares me
If you are not content, and have an opinion the dogs of the fidesz will cry for your blood
Literally
Austria: No, not really, as they are neutral
But, I would actually be happy if they annexed Hungary lol
Slovenia: It's not that powerful, so, no
Croatia: Just a little bit
I couldn't see them going to war but, if they did, they would probably win againts Hungary
Serbia: Thankfully, our relationship is better now, than it was in the rest of our history but, if they went to war, they would probably win
Romania: Many hungarians are still really salty over Transylvania, which is really dumb
I think Romania is a pretty neat country, and it's good to see them growing so quickly
And, that's why they could easily defeat us
Way bigger economy, population
But, i couldn't see them going to war
Ukraine: Same as Romania
Slovakia: Both of our militaries are pretty pathetic, so not that threatening
Well, the Hungarian nationalists want "big Hungary" back, but I mean, we deserved Trianon, plus there is only a small minority "stuck" outside of Hungary
The Hungarians are in minority everywhere, even in Transylvania
So no, I'd rather be afraid of my own country than to be from anybody else
Hungarians are just so stupid
We're coming for that Zakarpattia >:)
Just wait till the Fire Nation attacks
I would say that the Hungarian people are the same as always, our government though
well I don't even know what to say anymore
The overwhelming majority of Hungarians have a very favourable look on Austrians
I came here to say this
>Hungary is the one that most openly talks about its irredentism (wishes to annex parts of neigbor states that were once part of Hungary)
I don't know, maybe I'm overreacting but Orban scares me a bit
Ngl it's not that severe, don't worry we're not gonna hurt you little one
**F E A R   U S**
> de facto control over our port
Excuse me
It was about an administration house built NEXT to the current port, which gives no control or anything
The house will build up next to Trieste anyway, which is not as close as Koper which is unfortunate for Hungarian exporting companies
&#x200B;
> wishes to annex parts of neigbor states that were once part of Hungary
This is what nationalist foreign politicians say to gain some voters
You will never ever find a single Hungarian politian party over 1% saying they support anything like that
Wow this is the first time I hear of this
If this is true, Orban and his cronies have been extremely quiet about this
Which is very uncharacteristic of them
Don't worry, we're weak as fuck
Slightly
It burns like an oil well
There are three types of people in Hungary
Belives in Orbán (Majority of the elderly, and adults) (They vote for him, because they were here when we lived under russian influence
And to be honest it is still better than back then)
Wants to change the prime minister and the political arrangement of the country
The people ( myself included) who just want to go away as far as I can from this political disaster
Whaaaat  A year ago or so the last independent (-ish) journals were full with the story
"vote" damn i wish election still was a real thing and wasn't done for show
Trianon is irreversible
Slovakia has a better economy than us
> The truth is we never excelled at anything
Maybe not the case recently with all the political divide, but you used to be pretty good at sticking together to push a common goal
We on the other hand tend to cannibalize ourselves for momentary gains
Like, I've read about a castle held by Royal (Habsburg) Hungary that the Ottomans sieged many times but couldn't take
Then East-Hungary attacked and sacked the castle, after which the Ottomans eventually took it
Good job us
basically our history in a nutshell
This mindset exists in Hungary as well, about the great hungarian stuffs, that great hungarians developed
The truth is that they almost never did it in Hungary
But we like to think that we fart the warm summer winds
As a European I lived in the middle East and was travelling around the wider Arab world including the Maghreb and the Levant
Some parts of the Maghreb very much resembles Europe/Southern Europe mostly in architecture - Casablanca, Tunisia, Lebanon
I also went to Carthage and it was pretty thrilling to see that heritage
I see a clear connection with North Africa, but probably it is more apparent to the French due to the language
Turkey and the Near East is actually closer to this part of Europe
To actually answer the question though, my knowledge is quite limited, but I did read a bit about its history
The Exarchate of Africa, the Ottoman-Spanish struggle over the region in the 16th century, the Barbary Wars, the French expansion in the 19-20th centuries, the Algerian War and the Algerian Civil War
These are the few things that suddenly come to mind
I would say the settlement of Hungary
Around 1000 when christianity was being spread and there were still nomadic pagan horse archers
I think it could make for an interesting story going back to the old games and the christians being the bad guys and it could have twists in the story where our first king Stephen I realizes that for them to be able to survive they have to convert
The 150 year long Ottoman occupation of a third of the Kingdom of Hungary in the 16th to 17th centuries
The northern third, ie
about present-day Slovakia was dominated by the Habsburgs, while the eastern third, Transylvania was trying to manouvre between the two big neighbouring empires
Lots of battles, constant raids into each others territories by light cavalry and infantry (the birth of the hussars), religious differences
Its easy, when the ottoman empire invaded Hungary, actually i think that would be a very interesting game
Yeah, this is a great idea
I like that
that would be epic
You mean Csák Máté?
You Germans have an interesting take on fun
me neither, i feel you
but my comment tried to be funny
it didn't got through
well that's true, i understand that
i didn't mean any harm, i want to clarify this
Yes it has
As I wrote it before here somewhere, there was a publicity stunt of a major commercial tv that they announced in like november they wouldn't air _Home Alone_ that year; and it caused a huge uproar (part of which was constructed by that channel, but part of it was genuine), so they "backed out" (probably this was the plan)
Then the slogan arose: "No Christmas without Kevin
But since then, it isn't a big deal anymore, I don't know if they're going to air it this year
EDIT: Oh yeah, I realized, they are going to air it in the main slot of Christmas Eve
_Die Hard_ didn't became a tradition, even if it was very successful in Hungary as well
_Love Actually_ in the other hand is aired every year around Christmas
For me personally, the ultimate christmas movie is _The Exam_. It's a Hungarian thriller from 2011, it's set on Christmas Eve 1957, one year after the 1956 revolution
It's about an officer of the secret police whose loyality was supposed to be tested (like everybody else's, so they're not traitors who supported the revolution)
It's pretty important that is set on Christmas Eve, it has a very good and heavy atmosphere
English subtitled trailer:
EDIT:
20-30 years ago, in my childhood, two movies (more precisely: miniseries) were traditionally aired around christmas: _Gone with the Wind_ and _Sissi_.
really just the gypsies who dress in adidas
not much else

In Hungary, despite it being a socialist country at the time the popular music in the 70s and 80s had a lot of western influence
In the 60s and 70s the most popular genre was classic rock and beat, the most popular bands were Illés and Omega
Towards the end of the 70s and in the 80s punk and new-wave got popular, but they couldn't get that big because of political reasons
In cultural politics Hungary was a bit more liberal than other socialist countries
Every artist (not just musicians but painters, poets etc
) belonged to one of the following three categories: Supported, Tolerated, Prohibited
So which artists were popular really depended on the government's approval
Fun fact: one of the most famous Omega song was sampled by Kanye West on Yeezus
The song Gyöngyhajú lány was sampled in the song New slaves without the band's permission so the composers sued Kanye and in the end they settled it out of court
None at all
If spoken slowly I seem to catch a few very basic simple words in Khanty and Mansi
Written nothing at all, they use Cyrillic, and even with Latin it's mostly unidentifiable
Apart from those nothing at all in the whole Ural-Altaic group
Edit: in fact I can catch more from Indo-European languages I don't speak with the help of my Hungarian knowledge beside English
Hungarians can't understand basically any Uralic language neither spoken nor written
Hümm, I'm a lover of Uralic languages, so I might be able to add more languages into the mix
Mansi/Khanty languages: A Hungarian speaker with a bit of knowledge of basic sound changes will understand a couple of words from a sentence, most likely verbs or other elements of speech that are a part of a language's core vocabulary
Udmurt, Komi, Mari (&Mordvinic): Grammar will seem awfully familiar, and a shared layer of Turkic loanwords will help too
Still, in order to actually understand something one must have some sort of knowledge about Uralic linguistics
The Samic and Finnic branch: Absolutely nothing, unless you studied them
Although most Hungarians report a "sense of familiarity".
In a nutshell: nothing really, unless you know a bit about uralic/finno-ugric linguistics
Finnish and Estonian: not at all
Mansi and Khanti: some words are similar
There's a video with the numbers in Mansi  which I can mostly understand
But I'm not sure if I could understand someone speaking coherent text in these languages
The language what
More like four thousand years old, actually (sorry, im both a linguistics student and an awful nerd)
We do have a whole bunch of connected words, they just happen to have shifted so far apart they aren't intelligible anymore:
Elävä kala ui veden alla
Eleven hal úszik a víz alatt
Self
Hangings
Cutting someone in quarters, I guess
But it was just one time
To the old barbed wire
Are you mean, polish death camps
A knife
You can't imagine something worse, really
No, my country has unionist movements
Transylvania specificly, the southern strip of Slovakia with a hungaian majority, or the complete overturn of the Versailles peace treaty of 1920
Both seven and week are "hét" in Hungarian
It is logical tho
Toy, game=játék
Day, sun=nap
Paradise and Tomato are both ,,Paradicsom''
Same with day and sun, "nap"
Uhu and Eule are specific kinds of owls so they don't count
I am first and foremost hungarian, but I have a strong connection to my county and city, what is rather unusual among hungarians
During the last century local  identities, traditions and dialects almost completetly dissapeared from Hungary
So 95% of Hungarians would connect themselfs first and foremost to their nation
definitely the city
apart from budapest, almost everything is shit in this country
Pesti vagy, vagy vidéki
Why would be thinking about yourself first and foremost as a part of nation rather than somebody from a region be nationalist
Regionalism among hungarians is almost nonexistent, only prevalent among székelys and csángós
Yeah, they are fascinating, especially csángós.
Fighting with my younger brother
During the 80's we only had two TV channels with only boring propaganda programmes mostly and 2-3 VCR tapes that we watched over and over again
Occasionally we played with the neighbor kids and rode bicycles when the weather permitted it
We used to play "pretend shopping" with empty sweet/snack packages; someone played the cashier and someone else played the costumer
We also spent almost every day at the playground and hang out at the abanonded house at the end of the street
"very well", in this particular order
More often than not, my tongue gets tied and I say "wery vell", or almost like "wary well" sometimes
Essentially anything with that weird "th" like in "think". Is it an "s" sound
A "t"? Perhaps "f"?
No, it's an abomination inbetween these three
For some reason I usually have a hard time with "problem"
Don't forget 'very rare'
My Swedish pal says the word "jungle" like "yungle". Love you Anton lmfao
Cultural thing, the UK is a poorer country and has a mentality to fight
Country is the cradle of modern boxing after all
Was always like that, pub fights have been part of the (working class/chav) culture for centuries
North Korea is similar to Hungary
At least that's the only country that uses the same old Hungarian buses (Ikarus) and Czech trams (Tara) like we do in Budapest when there is a problem with air conditioners on newer buses

We use Microsoft teams as well, but it varies day by day how much classes we have
The school has been taking measures to make the teachers hold as much classes as they can (first month we only had like 3 times an entire week, now its about 3 per day on average)
Exam season started this week, in Hungary it's a 1,5 month long nightmare where we don't have classes, only exams, so we don't have online classes anymore
Before this week only one of my classes were held properly by Teams meeting, the other classes were either recorded by the teachers, some of them only made audio files, others tried to make ppts with audio files and some even did video recordings or they just uploaded their ppts
Moodle was the most popular site for this, but some teachers used Canvas and Neptun too
We have to take our online written exams on Moodle this year, I had one this morning and it was pretty weird
(Neptun is a Hungarian site/system, where you can sign up to your classes and exams, teachers can upload files etc
It's not a really student friendly site, so most people don't like it
we use "somtoday" and "teams". somtoday is like a dutch I think platform where you can see  homework and links to websites where you make them and stuff like that
and I dont think I have to explain teams lol (teachers at my school are really tech illiterate and they often give every student admin rights to kick and mute people lol)
The only lesson they kept doing is Math, 3 days a week on the school's Discord server
For homework and assignments, we use Google Classroom, except one teacher who for some reason uses Facebook (though because he can't really see if we do our homework or not, only 2 or 3 people do it)
Zoom or discord for live lissons, google classroom for tasks, redmenta for tests
I have 1 or 2, sometimes 3 online lesson a day, mostly math, chemitry, biology and german
My school has a Discord server, two student runs it as admins
95% of the students and teachers are there
Probably my class started it first with a class Discord with our class' main teacher (idk how they say it in english)
We had only voice chats, but maybe we will do simething with Discord's video mode
We take notes on online classes or copy it from the documents from Google Classroom (or don't make notes at all :])
We also use Teams but there is no online classes we just have tasks
Also our school got a microsoft partnership wich is great because we get all sorts of free stuff (even free computers if someone does not have one) and when there is actual school we even got tablet rooms wich we can use
you should cheer some bits
We have Göd
Well we have Pornóapáti
Szalonna (Bacon) and Bugyi (Panties) from the top of my head
There is one called; Bugyi - meaning female underwear
That counts
Same could be said about the cold war but nothing happened in the end
Drivers are frequently exploited by the trucking companies with challenging quotas, pushing them to drive over the legal limit and deductions if they fail to meet them
I think it's plausible the choice to not pay the highway tolls wasn't his at all, and then he panicked
Haha, are you hungry
*no*
Are you hungry
ArE yOu HuNgRy
Dont ask this
Even as a joke
It is annoying
I havent really experienced this kinda stuff but i think you can guess their reactions
(This is actually annoying af dont do that)
aRe YoU hUnGaRy
They make jokes about being hungry because haha very funny Hungary and hungry is almost the same hahah (NOT ITS NOT, SO STOP MAKING THIS "JOKE")
If I had a forint for everytime I heard that, I wouldn't be hungry anymore
People in my country used to call wack weed "0
8 Albanian"
Get out
permanently banned from entering Hungary and Turkey
Hungry for greecy turkey
Yes, only once at December
The funny thing is that there is a village called Széphalom, which gets snow almost every day during winter and it’s about 15 kilometres away from my town
Yes, on the first day of December, but after that, nothing
I was pretty surprised by it, because I haven’t seen a storm like like that in the last last few years
It caused a lot of chaos, but it was kinda magical
By the way I live in Budapest
Sárospatak
Yep, you got it right
Sadly still very popular
(Mostly old people use it
Funny
Yeah, some old people still do it, but they are catching on too that it is, indeed a scam
The younger generations just laugh their asses off when they come on
The bridge Margit híd (Margaret Bridge) was detonated by the German Army in November 1944
As the Soviet troops were advancing towards Budapest, the German forces placed explosives in all the bridges of Budapest in order to make the transport more difficult to the enemy when it comes to that
Later, all of the bridges were blown up during the siege (which was one of the bloodiest and most terrible city battles of WW2, but not as famous as Leningrad, Stalingrad or Berlin), but the Margaret Bridge was blown up probably accidentally almost two months prior to the siege when everyday life was still ongoing
As you see, cars, pedestrians and also a tram was on the bridge when it happened
Cca
40 military engineers (mostly German) and more than 100 Hungarian civilians died
Maybe this one:
The sinking of the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought, SMS Szent István.
You sure she's 38
I think you did a typo
I love the version where there's a photograph of the patient decades later pointing to himself on this picture
Damn
I'm Hungarian and never knew this photo existed
This is shocking
And our GDP wouldn't be the quarter of Austria's if the Soviets had left us, too
Maybe because of Christiaan Barnard who performed the very first heart transplant in the world
Then I guess it's not that iconic as I thought
What I meant is that she looks much older on the photo than 38
How about the average amount of popes per square kilometres
Either Japanese or Italian
Both are great in my opinion
Sorry, but all Germanic language sounds like a drunk, except German which sounds like an upper respiratory tract infection
Ah, the deadly duo
Oh cool, what song was it
The most iconic one
We should really mix it after the Hungaromanian Empire has been established

cursed but i dont have much against it
LETS DO IT
Huh, the music video of that was used as an example of video editing by my IT teacher a few years ago
What counts as foreign-born
* Do Álmos and Árpád, the princes who conquered the Carpathian Basin for us and were born outside of it
* Do our countless rulers who were born outside the borders of modern Hungary, but in areas that were part of Hungary, count as foreign-born
Do those count that ruled after the Treaty of Trianon
* Do Hungarians count that were born in another country, or only foreigners born elsewhere
* Does the 400 years of Austrian rule count as an occupation
We can include the following people based on the location of birth:
* Peter Orseolo (1038-41, 1046-59), son of a Venetian doge and the nephew of our first king
* Géza I (1074-77) and his brother László I (1077-95) born in Poland to a Hungarian king and a Polish princess
* András III (1290-1301), born in Venice as the grandson of a Hungarian king
Last Árpádian ruler
* Vencel (1301-05) born in Prague, claimed the throne of Hungary after the extinction of the Árpádians
* Ottó (1305-07) born in Burghausen, claimed the throne of Hungary after the extinction of the Árpádians
* Károly I (1308-42) born in Naples, great-grandson of an Árpádian ruler, was able to gain and stabilise power in Hungary
* Károly II (1385-86) born in Naples, gained the throne by marrying a daughter of the last king who had no male heirs
* Zsigmond (1387-1437) born in Prague, later became Holy Roman Emperor
* Albert (1437-39) born in Vienna, first Habsburg ruler of Hungary
He was the son-in-law of Zsigmond
* Ulászló I (1440-44) born in Kraków, also king of Poland, died in the battle of Varna
* Ulászló II (1490-1516), also born in Kraków, nephew of Ulászló I.
* Not listing Habsburg kings, who could be considered occupants
Princes of Transylvania:
* Katalin von Brandenburg (1629-30) born in Königsberg (Kaliningrad), prince of Transylvania, wife of a former prince
Prime Ministers:
* Károly Khuen-Héderváry (1903, 1910-12), born in Jeseník (Austrian part of Austria-Hungary)
* Géza Fejérváry (1905-06), born in Prague
* Károly Huszár (1919-20), born in Nussdorf, Austria
* István Bethlen (1921-22), born in Gornești, Romania (which was part of Hungary at the time of his birth, but not at the time of his rule)
Under German occupation:
* Döme Sztójay (1944), born in Vrsac, Serbia (which was part of Hungary at the time of his birth, but not at the time of his rule)
Under Soviet occupation:
* Zoltán Tildy (1945-46), born in Lučenec, Slovakia (which was part of Hungary at the time of his birth, but not at the time of his rule)
* Mátyás Rákosi (1952-53), born in Ada, Serbia (which was part of Hungary at the time of his birth, but not at the time of his rule)
Stalinist dictator
* János Kádár (1956-58, 1961-65), born in Rijeka, Croatia (which was part of Hungary at the time of his birth, but not at the time of his rule)
Communist dictator, de facto ruled 1956-88
I'm not sure Habsburgs could be counted as an occupation
They had tyrannical periods for sure, but they became lawful kings at the time
She said, that at the Battle of Waterloo, it was the British, who came to relieve the struggling Prussians, not vice-versa
I asked her if she was sure about that twice, but she kept clinging to her truth
I didn't bother to directly correct her though
She said we are closer to the sun at summer, that's why it is warmer
It was in 2nd grade
Never corrected her, but it was an early realisation that most adults are extremly stupid
> Romania single-handedly helped the Entente win WWI because we joined the war
That statement would be much more appropiate for Italy
Sure, they were the pinnacle of imcompetency, but they still tied down valuable Austro-Hungarian assets and even saved the Serbian Army from annihilation
Without them, things like the Brusilov Offensive wouldn't have been as successful as they were
In such sceniario, the Romanians might have even entered the war on the side of the Central Powers
Wow 100000 people under 30 years is a big increase, especially for a European country
How did they managed that
It's barely over 40,000

It's not public holiday, but that's when you are supposed to take down the tree
Probably the two beginning lines from János Arany's Toldi Miklós:
"Ég a napmelegtől a kopár szík sarja,
Tikkadt szöcskenyájak legelésznek rajta
Or probably the first verse of Sándor Petőfi's János vitéz
"Tüzesen süt le a nyári nap sugára
Az ég tetejéről a juhászbojtárra
Fölösleges dolog sütnie oly nagyon,
A juhásznak úgyis nagy melege vagyon
or *Nemzeti Dal* by Sándor Petőfi\*, "Rabok legyünk, vagy szabadok

"\*.  "Shall we be slaves
Shall we be free

Answer me
" Romantic poem calling for Hungarians to unite and break free from the Austrian Empire
Most people probably forget about József Attila after school, but this probably stays
Other than the anthem and the national poem, Its probably that:
"Talpra magyar hív a haza"
For not Hungarians: it's the first line of the Nemzeti Dal (National Song), the rest of the poem is well known too
Translation: "on your foot Hungarian, the nation is calling"
Written by Petőfi Sándor
That's fucked up
Is that a true story
Szerintem József Attilának kicsit jobban sikerült rátapintania a néplélekre
Do you happen to know the Hungarian movie _Bibliothéque Pascal_?
The 75 % of it is in Romanian (like 20 % is in English, 5 % or less is in Hungarian)
Surprisingly, it's not at all about Trianon or Székelys, more like it's a tale about a typical Eastern European fate told in magical realism
It's totally a Hungarian production with some very fine Romanian actors
I very much recommend it:
In Hungary, we don't really either
I mean it's a topic for a certain, small and loud circle, most people don't really think about it
As I said, this movie isn't about it, it could be set in Hungary, Slovakia, Poland as well
But I think Romania is a good choice, because of its semi-exotic, superstition-prone atmosphere
never call a hungarian "hungry", half the time we would give you death stares or insult you, except you cant understand what we are saying so its even worse, not to mention everyone swears like its no tomorrow
>2 more vowels than English
Any reason to point that out specifically
Can confirm
Does "Hollandia" gets a pass
It's not "Holland" afterall
In Hungary, relatively speaking I think IKEA is expensive, at least people around me had this perception
I think it’s on par with the competition but cheap, I wouldn’t call it cheap (considering the average income)
In Denmark, people seem to look down on Ikea but they have good quality and they are affordable (compared to income)
I don’t get the people who pride themselves not having anything to do with Ikea, it seems a bit pretentious when they buy a designer stool for DKK 2000
Strange how different countries look at the same company
IKEA is an expensive furniture shop, but if you want NEW and stylish furniture with really high quality you have to go there
IKEA food isn't really known or talked about in Hungary, maybe the mustard
I agree with you very much
I was looking forward to it, and it was a total disappointment
It's not that bad, but what you say is very true
I felt while watching that it was like those tweets "I made my AI watch 2000 hours of Batman and then generate a Batman script":
EDIT: and the speech at the climax in the TV show was ridiculous and bad writing since it was totally out of character
If you speak German I happened to start a discussion about it just yesterday:
No self respecting country should have anything to do with bases on its home soil
Why
bloody murder that is why - i mean in the literal sense, "black sites" aka
torture camps, or simply murdering your citizens & people passing through based on suspicion without any resemblance of fair trial
And if they off the wrong guy, its okay mistakes happen
(oh and constant attempts to wiretap local politicans, and hopefully extort them with the information, be it the german cancellor, or the "just" the majority of greek politicians)
Yep, this right here
It's very complicated though
Hard to understand as a foreigner
Ja, habe schon bereut
What kind of argument is that
It´s okay to have froeign (allied) military bc they leave a lot of money here
Most European countries would argue with national pride and lack of sovereignty and wouldn´t care about the money
yeah, about 300 of them
It´s not 40
000 like the other way around
Do you buy flowers to your mom or they are just a waste of money
We have a Milbona Golden Hills branded one over here and the packaging says it was made in Ireland, but now these comments made me *really* question if it has an authentic taste or not
Well, I guess I have one more reason to visit Ireland one day, I gotta try the real deal - especially since this Milbona one tastes quite good already compared to other butters we have here
Do we eat spicy
I mean we do, but isnt that common in other european countries too
If its true than we can only blame the inferiority complex of the avarage hungarian
I did eat a ton of spicy food once, just to show if how cool i was, because I can eat a lot of spicy food
:( I didnt felt good after that, neither in my body or in my mind
Ah, my whole life has been a lie all along
Seriously though, it's somewhat disappointing that they're not like the real deal, especially that they still taste better than their local alternatives, hehe
In my city, there are two shops with all their groceries from Poland
Both are quite small, but the prices are pretty similar to the other nearby grocery stores
Yugoslavia, i recently watched the documentary made by BBC, its crazy
I love history in general, but Sabaton and their album Carolus Rex got me really interested in Swedish history
Not a country, but a collection of them, the Danubian Habsburg Monarchy
And no, calling it simply Austria is not acceptable
I like my own country's history and Europe' history as well
What I would like to know a lot more about is Polish history
They don't teach a lot about it in school
Japan, everything about it is interesting
What
Do you mean the during the raiding period
Honestly as a Hungarian I can encourage you to do so
It's really fascinating how our small country contributed so much to world history
This nation is more than 1000 years old at this point and gets overlooked a lot when we talk about world history but a lot of things happening here or caused by us changed the world forever
Let it be bad or good
Yeah we have contraversial time periods but who doesn't?
Youtube
Well, you were atleast actually part of Austria between 1804 and 1918, but not before
Meanwhile, Hungary was part of it only between 1849 and 1860
Yes, the Black Army was really ahead of its time
It's a shame what happened after him
I would go back in time to watch the 31 match long undefeated run of the hungarian National Team
Than giving them modern football shoes before the World cup final
Summer of 1896
I'd love to see the millenium festivities in budapest
Probably the 1896 celebrations of the millennium of the conquest of the Carpathian Basin
850-900, so I could see how nomadic hungarians looked and lived during the honfoglalás. I'm expecting some central-asian/turkish looking dudes in yurts
Man, hungarians sound so much more interesting befire adopting christianity and feudalism, I would really like to believe that we could have survived without changing religion
Our culture is nothing like our ancestors
1914 June
I would rush to Sarajevo immediately and do everything I can to prevent a certain tragedy
aah yes that's a good choice
i was gonna say something during the dualism and i guess here's my answer
by the way have you read böszörményi gyula's recent series
it was set exactly at that time
yes, it's mostly for young adults but my mom and even my grandmother enjoyed it
Highest ELO rating of all time
Why
First olympics
Millennium celebration
I borrowed the 5th book from the library right before lockdown
I've had it since november and i'm moderately sure some people want to strangle me
Very well researched books, i love the historical bits
I can whistle the tunes of the Soviet and the French anthems, and I know some lyrics from both
Other than that, I could probably recognize the British and the German ones
Football stadiums
Moncler jackets and puffy vests
Do you think they think like that
What TV show has the most amount of episodes in your country
In Hungary Barátok közt (Among friends) has been going for 10334+ episodes and is ending this summer (After airing for around 23
5 years)
You'd have to watch it \~107 days non-stop without breaks to finish the entire show
What is a show that is very long in your country
Amint elolvastam a címet, egyből tudtam, hogy egy magyar írta ki, és azt is tudtam, hogy példának a Barátok köztöt fogja felhozni
:DDD
It is technically Swiss-British-South Korean
Szia bazdmeg
Not exactly in my country, but not far
I am hungarian and when we visit our relatives in Slovakia I can barely understand what they say
It seems to be only me though, since my other relatives understand them just fine
I also find their accent mildly annoying
I may be biased though, since I am tired of the Trianon victim mentality they give off
Hungary has some snow every winter, but recently it never lasts for too long
In th recent years we had twice serious snowfalls in March, once in a 4 day long weekend, that was interesting, with all those people stuck on the highways
At the workplace (multinational company) I have a summer job , my co-workers making fun of me and/or making negative comments toward me because I dye my hair (I'm male)
I don't want to imagine what I would got if I had a piercing
Ear piercings are fine pretty much everywhere
My wife works in one of the most conservative professions and she has more than one
No one cares but I'm pretty sure her bosses wouldn't be fine with a nose, lip or eyebrow piercing
That said, most employers don't care about piercings as long as you aren't the face of the company towards customers and it isn't a safety hazard
If you're the face of the company, it depends on its image and sometimes your gender
Women have a bit more freedom when it comes to jewelry
It's accepted by most of the youngsters, but old people can get really upset when they see someone with it
So ladies with earring are considered to be victims of female genital mutilation in Poland
It depends more on company culture than anything else
Some places allow you to be a dick to others, if you have an excuse like conservativism, other require basic human decency and accept no excuses
I believe most of the population is either atheist, non-religious or atleast non-practicing, so fairly normally, I guess
As an Atheist who attended a lot of religious service with friends and family, it seems to me that Catholics think agnostics exist only because they haven't learned about Jesus yet
They always get confused when they find out how much I know about the Bible and still not one of them
Anyway the country has both Christian and Communist heritage therefore theists and agnostics rarely confront each other
We don't just have jokes about our prime minister,we went a step further
We have a joke (quite bad) as a prime minister
I'm Hungarian but when I say Budapest in English, I always pronounce it with an s sound, since pretty much every person I've heard speaking English pronounced it that way
its pronounced with an sh
the letter "s" is always pronounced as an english "sh"
the exceptions are only a couple of older family names
A guy I knew from Rio, Brasil pronounced it Bundapest as a joke
Bunda meaning butt
Of course with "sh". That's the proper Hungarian pronounciation of the city
And tbh and I don't really care if someone pronounce it with "s". But I won't use that way
It's a Hungarian name, I am Hungarian and it doesn't really change the sound of the name
So for me there is no point using the "s", even if everyone in the group uses it that way
This is such a weird question, especially from a non-Hungarian
I always assumed pronouncing with sh is to respect the hungarian pronounciation and not pretentious
When talking to Hungarians it is "Budaopesht".
When talking to foreigners it is "Budápest'
Both the "a" and the "s" sound are different
Hungarian "a" is a mixtrue of English "a" and "o".
Wow
Backwards
> the letter "s" is always pronounced as an english "sh"
That's why most foreigners sound like they have a lisp when they are trying to pronounce our town names, they are saying our "s" like the English "s" when it's supposed to be what "sh" is in English
Not that I blame them, but it does sound weird
I *think* we have that sound too ("ty") and no, we don't.
Buddapesth, but the D is short (RIP)
like the "s" in "six"
We call it Koppenhága (or if you are Ferenc Kazinczy, Kappanhágó...)
>I'll pronounce it Budapesht when Hungarians pronounce Copenhagen "København".
We are fine with *Koppenhága
;-)*
This is the Askeurope thread so I wasn't really referencing francophone canadians saying it this way
I refuse to say Edinburgh's name in anyway but in my own made up Hungarian pronounciation:
Get redi for Edinboró
Yes, that is correct
Yes, but in Polish it's the opposite
yeah the z turns the "sh" sound into an "s" sound
sz considered one letter, just like all of our other "combined" letter (cs, ty, dz etc), bur on keyboards these letters arent included because it would be kinda useless, plus it would take too much space up
it would also be impossible in the first place because the hungarian keyboard is already full of letters
just google a hungarian keyboard and youll see that theres no more space
sz is a short (thats how we call it) letter, meaning thaz the "s" sound is pronounced short
if you wanna make the sound long, (double it), you write "ssz" ("sas" in english would be pronounced like "shash", "szasz" would be pronounced like "sas". then "sszasz" (this word doesnt actually exist, its just for demonstration) would be "ssas". if you know how s/sz works in polish, then its easy to remember
for us it works the opposite way)
the same doubling method applies to every hungarian double, and the one triple letter we have (cs -> ccs; dz -> ddz; dzs -> ddzs; gy -> ggy; ly (this is the same sound as a letter "j". for example: "y" in english "you") -> lly; ny -> nny; ty-> tty; zs -> zzs)
i hope i explained it well lol
I don't think ty=cs, it's a totally different mouth/tongue position
At least for me
Jesz, det iz korrekt
That is a good explanation
You would pronounce "Zs" like the s in leisure
A bit like "s" mixed with "j", yeah
So Zsófia would be something like zhofeeya
With the "zs" as the first letter
lol here we use qwertz and out bottom line goes like:
shift (but smaller than on other keyboards to make space for the í), í, y, x...

Norwegian, Mandarin Chinese and eh I don't know
Arabic sounds pretty but I also like Vietnamese or I could pick any slavic language because I wouldn't be able to learn those otherwise
Or Irish Gaelic
I'd probably just spin a wheel for the third one
Dutch, German, French
I want to live in that area when I'm going to be older, so learning those languages instantly would be a great headstart
german because well i was stupid and didn't took it in school and as some kind of lawyer, it's pretty essential in hungary
spanish, because even tho i took it in school, our teacher was shit
it's a beautiful language tho
third is either korean or french
french for law again, korean for the music and dramas but i'm not sure i want to understand them lol i'd rather just watch subtitles if i feel like it
German, Russian and Japanese
I learnt the first two in school, but I'm not quite satisifed with my level of proficiency, that's why I would choose them
English is a language I'm already quite comfortable with, so instead of wasting my third choice on it, learning Japanese sounds better to me
Not only because I like watching anime, but also because it could open up great job opportunities, since there are some big Japanese firms present in Hungary, like Suzuki and Denzo

Greetings from Hungary
They have been removed, but the site a lot of them were transported to is open, it's called Memento Park
They were all destroyed
Some buildings remained, but were mostly reconstructed
for example
If there was a theather
Now it is a shop
Hammer and sickle, red star, swastika, and others like that are illegal to wear and show in public so you only see them in classrooms and museums
They looked good, and some commie built buildings are still the way they were intended
Boomers don't really give a sh\*t abbout communism or capitalism
My grandma always said:"When I was a kid, I didn't really care about them
when I grew up, de-stalinization came, and it was way more normal
And there are also some monuments in cemeteries
> the 13 meter tall head of Karl Marx in Chemnitz (formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt)
That one was kept because it was considered one of Chemnitz' most important sights
I've never heard about it before so I just googled it
It's a pretty bizarre sculpture, why isn't his neck and some of his torso included
It looks like someone beheaded Marx and put his head on a stand to show it to the people
TEK sometimes does things other than "building relationship with the community" by parading around
They are the people who are ordered to collect high profile organized crime stuff, or that right wing moron who mag-dumped and AK into a police officer
And if you been here since the COVID started you see an armed force member detached to every 1-3 cops when on patrol - who are more heavily armed than handguns
...well thats what military does in peacetime - gross incompetence
[French do like their revolvers] previously mentioned scoped monstrosity was tailor made for one of their specialist police detachments (if thats the correct english terminology ... pff
Sounds strange from the get go
Here its not the job of the run of the mill cops to engage dangerous criminals
The procedure for them is to back off, don't play cowboy & sheriff, calling in the SWAT (equivalent), and let the experts sort things out
After all they have the tools AND THE TRAINING to handle the situation
&#x200B;
P.s.: No handgun has a place in any sort of serious gunfight, they are just backup weapons
In that role revolvers perfectly suffice
And neither pistols nor revolvers hold a candle to either assault rifles, or machine pistols in CQB
...what i meant is that you don't try apprehending suspected bank robber, suspected maffia members, suspected rightwing militants, with random run of the mill officers
That has been done accidentally in the last 10 or so years, and it ended up a 40 something neo nazi gun trafficer mag dumping an AK into the officer
&#x200B;
However i agree that violent crime is far more rare here, and thus its highly unlikely that officers just randomly stop gun toting criminals in a traffic stop
Our continents:
Europe
America
Africa
Asia
Australia
Antarctica
I have seen it in so many variations, that I can't tell how schools teach it, it probably varies by school books
North and South America are usually seen as different continents
Some sources call "Australia and Oceania" a continent, while others call Oceania a continent (which includes Australia)
North-America, South-America, Asia, Afrika, Australia and Oceania, Europe, Antarctica
I was taught this 7
We were also told about Eurasia being a thing
Right now, the government and the mayor of Budapest have a huge conflict as the mayor turned one of the lanes on a major road into a bike lane, which the government says causes huge traffic jams in the city
As you can see on this example, not great
In Hungary the close family is invited to EVERYTHING
Birthdays, anniversaries, everything
They are always held at a home of one family
Ironically, from our extended family we are only in good relations with those who are the farthest away
They live in Slovakia and we visit them sometimes
In the close family, it's always a dinner with tv watching afterwards

King Matthias Corvinus, there are a lot of tales about him
Hunor and Magor
(The Legend)
Árpád, the leader of the Magyar tribes
Sándor Petőfi
Lajos Kossuth
John Hunyadi
Sigismund von Luxembourg
Miklós Horthy
Stephen Szechenyi
I wanted to write more, but I grew tired of it, so here are some notable historical figures of Hungary from only the Middle Ages
Every Hungarian should know them
Saint Stephen, our first king, transformed the loose paganic confederation of the Magyars into a heavily centralised christian kingdom
Saint Ladislaus, another saintly king of ours, mostly known for the canonisation of Saint Stephen and his conquest of Croatia
Andrew II, huge money waster, lead the 5th Crusade, issued the first Golden Bull
Béla IV, the so called "Second Founder", lost against the Mongols, rebuilt the country
Andrew III, the last member of the House of Árpád.
Charles I, first Anjou king, ended the interregnum and feudal anarchy which followed the death of Andrew III, restored royal authority, reformed the economy and made the country rich
Organiser of the Royal Meetings of Visegrád, fromwhich the modern Visegrad Group was inspired
Louis I the "Great", took full advantage of the wealth left behind by his father, and was waging wars endlessly
In the last ten years of his life, he also became King of Poland
Sigismund of Luxemburg, King of Hungary, King of Bohemia and also Holy Roman Emperor
Lost against the Ottomans at Nicopolis, ended the Western Schism, ignited the Hussite Wars and was responsible for the creation of the Southern fort system against the Turks
John Hunyadi, the "Turkbeater", fought against the Turks on countless occassions, lost at the Battle of Varna, became regent-governor of the country and remained until his death
Victor of the Siege of Belgrade of 1456
Matthias Corvinus, son of John Hunyadi, became King of Hungary after the untimely death of Ladislaus V von Habsburg
His rule was marked by absolutism, economic and military reforms, the introduction of Renaissance and by many wars
Conquered most of Bohemia and Austria
Some call his rule the Apex of Hungarian might
* Álmos and Árpád, the conquerors of the Carpathian basin (as well as the six other chieftains: Előd, Ond, Kond, Tas, Huba, Töhötöm)
* Saint Stephen: first king of the country (and possibly his pre-coronation rival, Koppány, due to a [famous rock opera]
* János Hunyadi: famous general who won the [Siege of Belgrade] against the Ottomans
* Mátyás Hunyadi: son of the latter, was elected king, had a mercenary army, became a folk hero after his death
* Lajos II: famous for losing the [Battle of Mohács] causing Hungary's downfall
* István Dobó: won the [Siege of Eger] against a completely overpowered Ottoman army
* Ferenc Rákóczi: started a (failed) war of independence against the Habsburgs
* István Széchenyi: contributed a lot to Hungary's cultural and economic development in the early 19th century, we have the first bridge in Budapest (his idea) named after him
* Lajos Kossuth: political rival of Széchenyi, wanted radical change, later became the leader of a (failed) war of independence
* Sándor Petőfi: famous poet, one of the leaders of the 1848 revolution (later died in war of independence)
* Ferenc Deák: contributed a lot to the Austro-Hungarian compromise, which later established Austria-Hungary as a dual federal state
* Franz Joseph: longest-reigning king of Hungary, famous for defeating the Hungarian revolution, then agreeing to the compromise, later starting WW1 over his nephew's death
* Elisabeth (Sissi): wife of Franz Joseph with an affinity toward Hungarians, possibly contributed to compromise via soft power
* Miklós Horthy: controversial interwar governor of Hungary, achieved temporary territorial gains and contributed to the Holocaust to an unknown level (depends on who you ask)
* János Kádár: communist dictator of Hungary from 1956
I would also add Stephen the First
No what the fuck, I never heard of that
They do love to get piss drunk and make a ruckus though
They treat Hungary like one big club to party at
I've had numerous unpleasant experiences with loud drunk British tourists who came for stag/hen parties

>they've been known to piss on Monument of Freedom
Old imperial instincts kicking in, I presume
It's called a hard brexit for a reason
At least our empire was at least partially Austria's fault
You have nobody to blame
I use English every day for entertainment (movies and such), and my studies, I have good associations with it
As a language compared to mine, it's odd, the pronunciation is silly, the grammar is easy for everyday speech, but the advanced grammar is not intuitive at all for me (with Hungarian's single past and non-existent future tense)
I like learning about the English language, there's so many irregularities
I also enjoy the different accents people have, they are not as common in Hungarian
I think that it's a great international language because of it's simplicity
But it's very different from hungarian in many ways, I'm glad that it's easy, but art like poetry just doesn't strike me as deep as it would otherwise
Aside from the great wovel shif clusterfuck - written & spoken forms of words have little in common - its dead simple
Perfect for lingua franca
Wait till you find out that hungarian uses the same word for he and she - yes, grammatic gender is a minor mindfuck to us (why it even has to exist
Why a book has a gender
) - however we make ip for it with various other bullshit
As a healthy high school student, I'm not afraid of catching the virus (I might already have had it), and I don't live with anyone who is older or has a chronic lung illness or similar so I would be okay with going to school (not to mention I HATED the quarantine school, but I can live with that if it's necessary)
I don't really care, I enjoyed both ways of education
Online classes were not as tiring and I had MUCH MUCH more freetime for myself
The quality of the education was obviously lower, but atleast I didn't feel anxiety because of exams and all of those, just handed in the homeworks and projects, got a good or decent mark, and thats all
Less stressful
Going to school is much more strict as it starts at 8 am, but atleast you have friends to have fun with
It will also be my last year of Gymnasium (Grammar school in english, kinda like Junior High in the USA), so spending this last year with my mates wouldnt be bad at all, I love my class, we are a bunch of idiots having fun in life
As for the virus: My region peaked at like 20 new infections, so I couldnt and cannot really be arsed
I just followed the lockdown rules
Some classes of my uni will probably be online in the fall semester too, which is nice because even if I miss our dear capital city a lot, I absolutely don't want to deal with the rent prices there
I feel safe
I bought a really good mask somewhere, so i can wear it without any issues
"In Hungary, the average number of jerks per capita is two
Géza Hofi
Btw, how well known is Eva Rezešova in Slovakia
Twice
I just asked, because the Bratislava - Košice motorway has been existing for a long time: the Hungarian M1 and M3 (through Budapest), and she caused an accident on the M3 en route to Bratislava for which she was in prison in Hungary for some years
It created a huge uproar
Good to know she had caused accidents on other occasions
I know Fico meant that, it's just an ironic saying in Hungary because of the extra traffic load on these motorways caused by the missing motorway in Slovakia
Well, the public opinion was very strongly against her, not because she's a Slovak, but because she was drunk and drugged, and killed four innocent travelers in a cheap car with her heavy SUV while speeding in the night
So it was unimaginable that she wouldn't have to go to prison
EDIT: she tried to bribe an expert to testify that the accident was the victims' fault, but it was quickly revealed, so even if she had had a chance somehow to miss the prison, this was the last straw
It would have been interesting to follow the Hungarian news about her as a Slovak, because she had been literally and totally unknown in Hungary before the accident, so initially she was just a random foreign woman
Of course, as the story unfolded, we also got to know her background, but initially we were totally unbiased, and still very angry at her
I'm from Hungary, i think you can guess
On a political level, it's flexing at each other on every tiny reason they can find and call it cultural, historical, whatever reason
This of course fuels the masses so widespread dislike of the country is common and i'm afraid next year will be even worse as neither of the sides will want to stop
On a persona level i'v been in Romania plenty of times and i never had any issues
People are decent when you're decent and they didn't care where i'm from
If we can't talk in English, they either talk or understand Hungarian
And i'm not talking about the Hungarians there, they obviously do speak Hungarian
Also, as i mentioned on an other thread, Romania has a pretty decent Ice Hockey team :)
Errrrr
ERRRRRR
Errrrr
From the idiots perspective, or from the people who have more than 2 brain cells
Oh well
What did OP expect
It doesn't even exist
Well asked for it
Tired truck drivers, bus drivers going home who sleep while driving and die, often with a van packed to the brim with coworkers
- sadly this is not an unfounded stereotype
Oh and stuff like [THIS] or [THIS]
A complete travesty of a country under communism, who used local nazi groups (of Bucharest progrom fame) as agents for torture murder and coercion
Had an orphanage "system" thanks to abortion ban that (rightfully) inspired the vampire twins from black lagoon, and after it got dissolved the situation somehow managed to get worse
At the same time bulldozing ethnic hungarian villages was the fad
Its also beyond me how Vlad the Impaler, or Nazi war criminals can be seen as national heroes, and have statues erected on townsquares
Its also the only country where you have drug addict gypsy gangs in the capital's sever system
Some strange fascination with retconning history - they are apparently all people with full roman ancestry (as opposed to fully romanized local people like in france)
The Hunyadi/Corvinus family was clearly full of the mighties of romanian nationalism
(To some degree i can empathize, we also have the same idiots here in hungary, according to whom everyone was, and everything was invented by a hungarian - at least they are not mainstream ...yet
Oh and the country where the majority of students flopped at high-school graduation exam after video recording of the event was mandated
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
And of course its the full time partner of ours so that our football hooligans have a constant competitor to measure their destructive power against (i mean against romanian football hooligans)
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
All in all a perfectly fine country (if we are willing to finally forget the damned historical grudges), with some glaring mistakes, just like our own - of course due to the idiocy & incompetency of the government taking a different from than ours, it looks damn funny from the outside
Romania bad, Hungary good
Mostly to Cluj-Napoca, the road there from the direction of Oradea or Arad
I've also been in a couple of places in Transylvania
Yes, i know i only visited places where you likely meet Hungarians, but my experience is that Romanian people learn the language at least on a get by level
I like your mountain roads
Well, the idiots are moving on the 1000 years old hungarian kingdom and we want all transylvania back
From my perspective, transylvania has never been mine, so I don't care and it does not matter how strongly the bloody politicians are trying to divide us, we have more in common then either of us can imagine
We both eat stuffed cabbage for christmas, we both drink tuica/palinka, so why the hate

It has a lot to do with being at the farthest reaches of the realm of the habsburgs, who forced gypsies to settle down ,and abandon their wicked ways
With more success in the former than in the latter
And the further you go from Vienna, the latter is less visible
As in the so called "rule of law" is something unheard, and some sort of tribalistic sense of justice is adhered to
In large cities with roma heavy slums, you will get strange looks, may get pickpocketed
In small  complete roma villages, you get pickpocketed by kids, and you may get linched
And then there are romanian gypsies
...no offence to romanians but you just don't have drug addictedgangs of them in the severs in any other capital, nor do i see traditionally dressed gypsies (in very layered cothing) cooking and festering in 40°C at noon under the sun, unless they are from there
And probably adds to the stereotype that there were some whole gypsy communities that left romania for somewhere else as the were
Canada for example
I'm well aware that it's likely my own and biased experience where i may have been lucky as fuck
And I'm pretty sure you know what pálinka is
The romas actually came from india, and there are childrens tales about how the sun gifted them with their skin color and how everyone hates them becouse they are jealous
harsh
How to insult Turkey even more:
"Sure they have the most, but they are not a part of europe
But I mean you, like us, are sandwiched between Slavic nations, and you have been disconnected from the other Romance nations for a long time
I have travelled all over Romania, and I didn't get the vibes I got in Italy for example
Edit: I am not saying, that by travelling through Romania I become a master, but this is what I, as an outsider experienced
The oldest is probably the [Castle of Diósgyőr] another very old building is the [Gothic Protestant Church of Avas]
Horthy Miklós (governor of Hungary) lead his anty-communist troops and the white terror from a villa in my town
It's  an hotel today, but it's in the middle of the "party part" of the town, so I don't think it's a good resting place
It's called Thanhoffer Villa
There are other villas near the lakeshore, that belonged to famous people
The less historical, but more famous landmark is the Watertower
It was converted to a café and bar, very good view, but expensive
The Ruin Garden, for example
It's the remains of the Nagyboldogasszony Basilica, which was originally built by our first king, Saint Stephen
It was modified and expanded numerous times during its existence, and it was the largest cathedral in Central Europe by the time it was destroyed during the Long Turkish War
Damn that was a fast answer
We're not Turkic though
We have two words for it, but don't know if they sound like "dude that is so metal". The common one is "kalapács" (we use this almost exclusively), and the other one is "pöröly".
In hungarian it's *kalapács*. Which is (unbiased) the most badass I've seen in this comment section
In Hungarian we translate the 'Martell' for 'pöröly' but the 'hammer' is 'kalapács'
Edit: The 'pöröly' in english is 'sledgehammer'
Tbh "pöröly" sounds kinda badass
I had to look that up
You are right, there is a band called Kalapács, but I have never heard about them before
The name of the founder and singer is József Kalapács, so they weren't too creative regarding the name
I think this band is not really well known, or maybe that's because I don't really listen to metal
Anyways, József Kalapács used to be the singer of the band called "Pokolgép" which is far more popular
It's difficult to tell without knowing what their degree, job and location is
If it's a teacher in Budapest, they'll need a second job or financial support from their family even if they have roommates
If it's a software developer in Budapest, they can probably rent their own flat in one of the cheaper districts and still save a few hundred euros
Here a fresh teacher (English language - Geography as an example) with a masters degree earns less than 700 € the rent itself takes away at least 200-300 € (bills not included)
We have a massive teacher shortage btw
I’m making an assumption that you don’t live in Budapest, solely based on the rent cost
I really don’t understand how teachers get by in the capital, they all have my highest respect
You are right, it's not Budapest level rent
I would hate to freeze on the Tatras
It's unfortunately very common
Most men think it's ok to do it
One time i was on a first date with a guy and while he was walking me home, he just said he had to pee, took off to a tree few metres away and peed like no one's business
I was really disappointed in him
It's just common, while walking my dog, I see guys peeing at least once every two weeks and that is way too many
It's not just drunk guys either, just men going home from the grocery shop, not being able to keep it in until they get home despite being adults
Well, I also saw one time a woman just squat down in a fucking bus stop, pull down her pants and piss in front of people waiting for a bus
So, I guess it's not just men, but I've only ever seen this one woman, and hundreds of guys doing it
It's super disgusting, but it seems most people don't think so
Czechia has far more forests than Scotland
So the average hiker denstiy in said forest is likely to be a lot lower
I don't get why there are only two options: al dente or mushy
Mushy is disgusting, but I don't really like al dente either
I prefer somewhere in between (closer to al dente, but decidedly not that)
As long as it is not crunchy, I don't really care
Pro tip: fry them in oil
Any random store
Usually we don't put milk in fridges (cuz u don't need to) and it's shocking to a lot of people
Same here, and from what I've experienced in Romania too
We only smile when we have a genuine reason
Im afraid to ask this, but whats wrong with ketchup on pizza
Why do you do that
>Usually we don't put milk in fridges (
Everyone I know puts it in the fridge
Before you open it
We don't have a spelling be for 1 reason, we pronounce everything exacly as we write it, for example in english if you say the word 'cigaretta' and 'enjoy' you pronounce the two 'e's differently, but there is no such thing in hungarian, and e is an e, so a spelling bee wouldn't make sense
The closest thing that I encountered was in my elementary school but it was more about writing tricky, commonly misspelled and foreign words correctly
In hungarian the spelling really closely follows the pronunciation, so no spelling bees here
We have grammar and spelling competitions
(I used to be quite good at them
) They usually involve writing down a spoken text
But it's nothing like the spelling bee
Hungarian spelling rules are quite consistent with pronunciation, so the main challenges are capitalisation and punctuation
Also, they are not televised at all, it's more like writing a test
You don’t need spelling bees when your language has a highly phonemic orthography
Yap, even putting phonetic languages aside, it's just such an obscure thing, I was really weirded out by the idea when I first heard of it
It sounds so forced and harmful towards the kids participating in it
generally having kids (<15yo) on national TV is kind of sketchy; but the thought of 12 year olds competing on a national level, on TV, especially in such a pointless skill doesn't sound awfully healthy
Geographical names can be really confusing when the -i suffix is added
True, but we pronounce it as j/ly every time
And there are some grammar rules about that too
Every 4 years we have a choice between Viktor Orban and Orban Viktor
In Hungary, we vote for a party on the general list; and then each elective territory has a representative assigned to them from all parties; whoever wins will get into the Parliament
The representatives are much more important than the general list, as if one party gets 2/3rd of the representatives (133) into the Parliament they win automatically (as FIDESZ changed the laws to be able to pass every law with a 2/3rd majority
It's pretty skewed, as even in 2018, Fidesz only got 49% of the votes on the general list but they still have majority in the Parliament, mostly because the opposition couldn't agree on who to run as a representative in many places
Hahaha exactly except we don’t have debates
I think it is not just a country thing but a gender thing too
I am a 30 years old female, have a long term relationship without engagement or kids: my old relatives are worried like sh*t that I won’t have a proper family
(Yeah, 6 years living together and sharing everything is not proper enough I guess)
They mention it on every family gathering . Although my parents are chill about it, they don’t really care till I am happy
My brother is 35, married but no children: nobody gives a f*ck
He is not harassed by old lady relatives and he was never pressured before the marriage either
These are only stereotyps and actually none of that is true
Except one
Buda: rich smartasses
Pest: entitled, arrogant people or flat-orks, thinks hungary is Buda, Pest and lake Balaton, the rest of the country is just illusion
BAZ county: incest and poor gypsies
Nógrád: rich gypsies
Debrecen: nice people and gypsies
Esztergom: our minivatican
Komárom: "we still flying a half ship"
Baranya: uranium miners and nice peoples
Zala: woodcutters
Somogy: absolutly superior in everything
Győr: rich german and austrian spies
You forgot Miskolc our own little incest land
Also there are basically no mines and no industry here just the restaurants
Miskolc is the center of BAZ county
Missed that
So funny that most Austrians hate Germans and as far as I know most Germans have no problem with Austrians
I mean why can't you just see Germany as the older brother
Many Austrians don't want to do anything with Germans, just ignoring them
I think if Austria wanted to cooperate with Germany, it would be an improvement for both countries especially for you, Austrians
No problem, have a nice day
When the language is the same it's much easier to work together, because you don't have to translate everything to English and then to the third language
I didn't said you two should unite or something, just that you could save some money
With older brother I meant that Germany is bigger and it's economy is superior than Austria's.
Okay :DD
Just one last thing :D
If you could choose a country to work together with reeeeaaaly closely then it wouldn't be Germany, right
I like it
You can visit a different culture every year for a 12$ ryanair ticket, and the flight takes less then 2hrs
or you can drive and still visit some countries
But in covid times I envy Americans
Now we are basicly trapped in our little countries
I saw the most interesting stuff already, some of them multiple times
But in the us you can still visit different places
however just an example:
In the summer we plan to walk with a tent from Budapest(Hungary) to the sea (Croatian coast) through Slovenia
We can visit 3 countries literally by foot
Of course the tour will take about 20+ days(540km), but its still crazy we can do this
The Maria Valerie Bridge is in Esztergom, Hungary
You step out into the street, you cross the bridge and you're Slovakia lovakia just like that
An example:
We once visited the water park in Lutzmannsburg, Austria
After we left, we walked across the border to Zsira, Hungary to have dinner, then walked back to our hotel in Austria
I really enjoy it, we go to school trips to Romania, Austria, Slovakia and sometimes even farther to Germany or the UK
(Of course I haven't been to all these places, I just put together the experinces of my friends and family; my school trips went to Vienna and the UK
1 mile = 1
6km
[Egg dumpling "cutter"]
It's used to reduce the making of [egg dumplings] from half an hour to just a few minutes
Also, I recently found out that [flat flush toilets] (the ones with the "poop shelf") aren't really common anywhere else besides here and Germany
It’s the go-to coffee maker in Hungary as well
IMO also the best way to make coffee
I know a similar thing, but maybe just because my grand-grandparents were so poor and kept these things for a longer time than others
I mean the schitzelklopfer is not an uncommon thing here (probably German influence but still)
>does poo not get like stuck to them
Not really
They do leave a slight mark most of the time but you can just clean it with a toilet brush
I personally like it that I don't have to worry about toilet water splashing up
I'm not sure, I guess it prevents water splashing up
Can confirm
Among many other things Hungary is the country of 10 million poop inspector after all
"Gaming is not a crime"
I wish people took littering more seriously like the Japanese do:(
The acceptance of other sexual orientations, genders, races and religions
Bike lanes in cities, that are safe
In Budapest, where I would have to cycle to uni, the bike path is in the single most used road of the city, just painted up on the side, buses and cars have to go around me
Parks (plural) there's clearly not enough here, if the weather's nice, they are full, it's not fun for me, no wildlife, too many people
It really is convenient and our only civilizational advantage compared to the DACH-countries
WW2 bombs under everything
Older buildings under the old buildings (I swear Buda Castle is like eleven layers of fortresses underneath the Castle)
Roman ruins under old buildings
One day you find out that that one barricaded doorway in the basement of your secondary school leads down to an uncharted 16th century cellar system that runs the length of the town centre, but noone's been down there in a century
Well sometimes pipes and waterproofing can be a problem, the house I'm living in has hay as the ceiling insulation, putting a lamp can be a difficult thing if you don't know where the main wooden structure is
The barricaded doorway went by the name 'the Basilisk's cave' among students, and we were forbidden from going there
Also it was pretty heavily barricaded with old furrniture
The cellars are said to lead to the Mayor's office/ municipal bureau (and a bunch of other buildings that are gone/ the entrances were destroyed), but noone knows if the cellars are still intact, because noone's been there in a while
I read about the whole affair in the local newspaper, when some explorations were proposed or planned, but nothing since
A short Wikipedia search reveals that while it became urbanised during the Industrial Revolution, Dortmund and Duisburg were important trading cities under the Hanseatic League during the Middle Ages
(Sidenote: The Ruhr area is part of the Rhine-Ruhr area, which includes further cities  like Cologne, which was also an important city during the Middle Ages as well
Fidesz worshippers always say that "wAs It BetTeR iN gYuRcSáNy'S TiMe
" (Gyurcsány - our previous PM)
And anyone else is a communist in their eyes
Which is something I never understood, because I mean I get it when Americans call something they don't like communism, but you'd think that people in Hungary, a country which was actually communist, would know what communism really is
But nope, every slightly left leaning party is already Marxist Leninist stuff for them
Also, their arguement often involves Hungary not having any migrants thanks to Orbán the Almighty
In their 2018 election campaign, their propaganda consisted of "Vona wants to tear down the border fence and let all the migrants in
" (Vona was the leader of the strongest opposition party until he resigned after losing the election)
Also also, Soros
Everything is Soros
Coronavirus is Soros
Migrants is Soros
Brussles is Soros
retiretards shoot off "oszt a gyúcsány jobb vót?" every time you try to convince them the oranges have to go to not slide into yet another dictatorship, even now, when the opposing parties joined forces and will try to knock off Orbán the 1st off his throne in 2022
the phrase means "but was (Ferenc) Gyurcsány [the previous PM, Hungarian Socialist Party] better
" with mocking spelling
I mean
the whole opposition is coming together to form an anti-Fidesz party, I don't believe that the general public would actually care who the opposition is, it's safe to say that a lot of people not voting for Fidesz does so to be anti-Fidesz
Also I often get the argument from people that Fidesz is the lesser worse party
As far as I remember it was Vona, who first started talking about building a fence on the border, so Orbán's accusation was even more ridiculous
You know what they say
Polak, węgier
Apparently we do *everything* together
Well, government propaganda is displayed on like 90% of media outlets, plus Hungary has quite a lot of retired people, and all the older generation needs to hear is that Orbán will raise their pension
Another issue is the uneducated layer, who doesn't even know what fidesz's policies are, they are as disconnected from reality as one possibly can be
Their vote is usually bought by some sacks of potatoes
[Here] is a video showing what kinds of people vote for FIDESZ
(You can turn on English subtitles)
De akkor ki fog minket figyelmeztetni, hogy a "Kígyók kígyóznak"?
no, they are just stuck in the time before the USSR commited nonexistence, they are indoctrinated the communist way therefore easily manipulated by the goverment, and the orange cunts mastered just that
these "nyugger"s are our classic thick-skulled idiots who cannot be reasoned with, even if you show them solid evidence that Orbán fucks them over too they will just throw excuses like they were programmed responses
why am I jumping at these old bastards only
like a big portion of Europe, we have an aged society, so they make up a pretty big part of the people who can vote, and their offsprings are often also indoctrinated by their parents and are similarly impossible to argue with
they don't vote orange in spite of someone (other than scapegoats), they vote because they were told to, by you-already-know-who, and they never question them, because they were teached against it
"vót" is "volt" but with a country accent, meaning "was", and considering our history, I wouldn't call a word beautiful when it points to the past, because ours is depressing
by the way, our word for vote is "szavazás" (the event itself) or "szavazat" (the vote you cast on the ballot)
Oh, and silly me, I forgot another thing
You know how he gave Hungarian citizenship to the Hungarians in Transylvania
Well, many of them also vote for him, despite not having lived 1 minute in his country
All they know, is that our previous PM rejected them, and now Orbán cares for them
That's plus many votes
Congrats, now you meet the requirements to vote for fidesz
it's not about the culture being bad, because it's not at all (in fact it's one of the richest in this entire continent and something to be proud of), it's the constant decline of the competence of our leaders throughout history that is still rolling downhill today
There was a tradition NOT to clink glasses (bottles) if you drink beer
Thus remembering/honouring the revolution of 1848 when - according to the legend  - the Austrians celebrated the execution of the 13 leaders with drinking beer and clinking glasses
Later an urban legend emerged saying historians had agreed that the 150 years were over and Hungarians now are allowed to do so, so people stopped NOT clinking
I find this a nice tradition, even though Austrians are not our enemies any more, I try not to clink my glass
Magázás/tetszikelés. In Hungarian language there are four forms of speech
Tegezés, önözés, magázás and tetszikelés. Think of like the Duzen/Siezen in German but with four patterns and a bit more complex grammar
**Tegezés** is the most informal one, it is used between family members, friends and kids
This form is using Te
(you) and basic conjugation
**Önözés/Magázás** uses Ön/maga (you) and some more complicated conjugation
Both are formal, önözés is more polite
Maga is kind of distancing and in certain contexts can be even straigh up rude
This is usually used in official context and when adults meet they use Ön (usually transferring to tegezés soon after)
Also used in shops or other daily "business" meetings
**Tetszikelés** is an auxulary word used with verbs when talking to elders
Its conjugation is complex and even in Hungarian certain words can be "fucked up" with it, sounding weird or straight up not correct
So tetszikelés and magázás/önözés are losing a lot of ground to tegezés. Often even in shops or formal meetings people use tegezés without even the introductory önözés phase
I'm not a super formal person, but it's kinda weird to me that a 20yo girl in some shop says Te to my almost 60yo father
IMO it's a very nice way to show respect to each other
Splashing girls with water during the Easter is starting to die out
People just stopping dying it after elementary, because they only know the "going to old female family members for money" side of it
I heard it is very uncommon in the capital, because people there are living in apartments, that isn't suitable for a good splash of water/ or they do it with cologne that is the boring fucking way to do it
Me and the boys still do it with our girlfriends/crushes or female friends and they actually like it, because
well
who doesn't like getting splashed with several buckets of water by their friends once a year
>Śmigus-dyngus mainly becouse of weather (last few years we were more likely to have snow on easter than on christmas) and people carrying electronics
We still have it in most places, though people in cities usually use perfume
It also disappeared here, but the greeting "(Kezét) csókolom
" (I kiss [your hand]) is still used when greeting older people
>Austrians are not our enemies any more
Good, good make them believe that
Our revenge will come
We will shit into their beer reserves
You are a great soldier of the Hungarian Resistance
Jesus does the gift delivery himself in Hungary on Christmas Eve as well
I don't think he will be superseded by Santa here, since Santa is also coming already on the 6th of December to fill your nicely cleaned shoes with sweets
One might say that this is a good example of letting each other live, others might say they formed a cartel and divided the market between themselves
You dont
Because the roads are in a such bad condition that your car will most likely break down (except if you drive a Lada Niva)
Same happened to me but in a rural area like 100 m from my house
When I saw the approaching car I stopped on the side of the road as there is no way for two cars to pass at the same time
The other guy did not even slow down and hit my mirror, luckily no damage done
Is there a "law" in Germany where you have to give priority for the car going upwards
I live in a hilly area and I rarely see this happen
Yes, most of such roads in the UK have got a national speed limit of 60mph~100kmh which is slightly mind boggling to me
For Hungary, I think it would be either one of [Brahms' Hungarian Dances] (even though Brahms was German) or [Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No
I would like to say Hungarian Rhapsody because
yeah
okay, this is a long shot but for hungary, gloomy sunday came to mind first a.k.a the infamous suicide song
ngl people love to feel sorry about themselves here and the suicide rates are pretty high so i guess why not
its definitely not a national anthem or anything but it has it's legacy and i think most people sorta respect this song a lot
I mean Erika is not a nazi song
Same as your Luftwaffe logo
What about "Wir sind des Geyers schwarzer Haufen"? That seems like being abused multiple times, but what are the current notions on that one
In Romania there is a city called Satu Mare which literally means big village, while it is actually a city with 100000+ people
(There is a village, too, called Satu Mare in Romania)
In the small town of Lábatlan, meaning 'legless', everybody I've seen had legs
Massive disappointment
Budapest suburbs called Kistarcsa (little Tarcsa) and Nagytarcsa (big Tarcsa)
Kistarcsa is way bigger than Nagytarcsa
Por-tó means Lake Dust in Hungarian
I have, but I'm not working full time, am still a uni student
Budapest is the most international, but I think Sopron feels the most foreign as it lays besides the Austrian border, more than the 5% of the population's native language is German and there are lots of people there who are going to the other side of the border to work, to shop, to study or to do something else
Islay is absolutely amazing
Love it
Of course it has to be hungarian
We are in straigth track to reach zero population, thanks to everyone leaving the country - and  not forcing their offspring to learn this monster of a language once they are living abroad full time
&#x200B;
So like in the good old days of latin, hungarian can be the common language
It plays no favourites
It sucks equally for everyone to learn it
Hungarian speaks for itself
One of the best options for an easy-to-learn, adaptive language for all of Europe, right behind Mandarin and Arabic
I saw a study once (cannot find the link, maybe someone else
) that stated that Hungarian is one of the most average languages globally (i.e. a language that shares features with most languages)
Only problem - while Hungarian is similar to many other languages **globally**, on a European level: not really
Well, it would be interesting
We have a lot more word than english, and we write everything as we say it, thats a pro
But if everyone would have to learn it
The grammar is so different from English, it's like german, but more extreme
But if everyone would just start speaking hungarian, than I see no disadvantage
Once i put on this [song] and my ex thought it's your language
I was honored
>Romanian : easiest language on earth to spell , all letters have always same sound and we always say all letters in the world as clear as possible ( no rules like French or English or even Dutch )
Having a phonetic writing system is not that unique, same is true about hungarian, or even german
Or Hungarian
I feel like I've summoned a demon
I really don't see how the language could survive if it only exists in transsylvania
Without being used as a laguage of science, administration ...etc
the language doesn't develop - and due to lack of functionality, it will simply cease to be used, as the topics that can be discussed with it become fewer and fewer
See the decline in celtic languages
When the language is hard to learn, and is barely functional "cultural pride" won't save it from going extinct
While i cannot be more supportive of my polish brothers, i think we would all need some extra help with your compounding consonants
The biggest issue with hungarian is that we have some sounds that are not present in most languages
Other than that its trivial
Yes, German has a few problems - however its pretty much nothing compared to English
Well yes but actually no
I used to go camping in Slovakia as a child - this is one of the very few words I remember
:-)
There are soooo many dialects and languages of the Roma people
just 7 in and around Hungary
Thx
(Your y looks strange to hungarians since, we only us y as part of digraphs (gy, ny, ty), so its only a letter on its own in foregin words
I guess its not worse than the classis s & sz things that most languages do in reverse compare to hungarian))
Voiced "s" is "zs" and voiced "cs" is "dzs".
And for english speakers you tehre is also ö & ü, which tends to produce funny results
Thats to be expected, since the vocabular has exactly nothing in common with indoeuropean languages, including romanian or slavic languages
Not to mention that the language is very agglutinative - aka
it like sticking words, adjectives and such together - which also makes it harder, since thats not a common feature in most languages
For example instead of of using the word "in", we stick "...ban" on the end of the word, for example it would be houseban
And those compound - so multiple things get stuck onto the same word - sometimes a lot of them
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
I only meant that pronouncing written words should be pretty easy, i am sorry if i mislead the people into thinking that picking up the language is easy
Well at least it was somewhat helpful for us hungarians
Well its just a table to "translate" polish digraphs into their hungarian counterparts
Treating our minorities like shit and pulling the biggest Pikachu face when they wanted independence
World war 1
Not really
Joseph II
Habsburg replaced the official language (latin) with German and tried to germanize Hungary, but in practice the vast majority of his decrees were not put into effect regionally (counties had autonomy)
So he take away the autonomy if the counties, but still nobody really cared about him
He was not even legally king (to be that, one had to be crowned in Székesfehervár by the bishop of Esztergom with the crown of St Stephen), which he didn't do
That's why we call him the "hat king".
He tried to force german education and all that on all the peoples in the Empire but he ultimately failed and abolished all his previous decrees on his deathbed, let alone for 3
Other than that, there were other attempts too by different monarchs, but none succeded
Hungary (or at least my personal version):
Cold: below 5°C
Chilly: 5
17 °C
Perfect: 17
23 °C
Warm: 23
28 °C
Hot: above 28 °C
\-15 - 5 winter coat

16 - 32 okay weather
32 - 40 throw me into a large body of water
This is my temperatures
Cold -1 - 12
Chilly 12 - 20
Nice 20 - 24
Warm 24 - 28
How 28+
Basically anything pre-European Hungarian history
We know nothing for 100%, all we have are theories
>- Instead of being assimilated, we were the ones who assimilated the Slavs coming here (explains why a few grammatical constructs like the vocative case in Romanian appear to be similar or inherited from Slavic languages)
I also sometimes wonder about what would've happened if we were assimilated instead of us assimilating others
It's weird how Bulgarians lost their language, but we didn't. But if we were assimilated I think we would've adopted the German language instead of a Slavic one
Does everybody know everybody in your country
Yeah
And the Holy Crown of Hungary is a mesopotamian (MEZŐ-potámia
mező means field ---> grain field, where did agriculture start
) is a star map that can lead the navies of the Sirius Star-Empire to the Reptilian Arch-world and put an end to the million yers long war between our species
I can even imagine a scenario where the nobility speaks German and the serfs speak Slavic
Asks someone from a country that has only existed for 28 years
I know 'Dia duit
' and "Póg mo thóin
' in Irish, so if I were to introduce myself to an Irishman from the gaeltacht, I think I'd make a questionable first impression
(Dia duit: hello; Póg mo thóin: kiss my ass)
>"Strč prst skrz krk"
I know this one too
It is "az angyalát" (so basically: * their angel) similar to  "a kutya fáját" (the tree of the dog)
We usually say these when we want to swear, but can't. (for example: a little kid is in the room)
Everytime I go to Vienna by car, somehow this song pops up in the radio all the time and my brain connects this song with Vienna lol
Can't wait for a greek to say ,,Our debt
Hope this didn't offend anyone
The dark sense of humour
That's the way
De biztos hogy *dugnád?*
In hungarian, we called spoiled children "elkényeztetett". It basically translates to "pleasured".
Spoiled you mean
Well, the word translates to pleasured
I think it must be the weight that misleads people
As most tend to mentally depict weight on the "1t = 1 car" basis
And that makes it seem like stonhenge is a lot bigger than it is since the boulders are a lot denser than cars
We have it here in Hungary, we call it "almafröccs". Which translates to "apple spritzer"
Apfelschorle is sold and consumed in Hungary as well
Of course, it's a very recent thing, but restaurants understand the Hungarian word for it, and they even make it from Cappy apple juice and sparkling water if they don't have it readily
I thought we are the only ones
I think you don't mean that but in most of our restaurants you can order "mixed side dish" which is french fries and boiled rice
For classical folks we are trying to use proper names, but for a while famous writers theri name got translated to hungarian
I grew up reading Verne Gyula, for example
We keep them in Hungarian too
(or transcribe the original spelling)
Then what would you think of that Hungarian texts used to translate even contemporary foreign names until like 1900
Examples:
Jules Verne - Verne Gyula (even the name order was changed
Karl Marx - Marx Károly
George Stephenson - Stephenson György
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe - Goethe János Farkas
etc
Hungary has excellent tap water
No, i am sorry but that is not true
You and austria has okay bread, france is also okayish bubt surprisingly hungary has the best selection of fresh bread baked every day
I have this on the window of this very room I'm sitting in right now
We do it like the rest of the world, nod for yes, shake for no
Why would you think that
We do it the “normal” way
TBH I was surprised to read that you guys do the opposite
Wow, it's really that
I don't get why the users say "carbs+carbs" or it's redundant: you don't get twice as much side dish, you get 1/2 portion french fries and 1/2 portion rice
Both are carbs, but the textures are different: crunchy fries and soft rice
I sometimes order this
Yeah
For the longest time - as a kid - I believed him to have been a Hungarian author, because of the aforementioned practice
Yes :)
May Károly
To be fair the congo was basically Leopolds private enterprise during the worst period
I actually remember hearing something along the lines of "romanians were so cruel even the nazis found it too much" though I don't know how true is it
What did you guys do
I mean apart from collaborating with the nazis
We have a few, but they for some reason keep insisting on being a different country
Madness, right
...what the hell is a "Slovakia" anyway
No idea how common place in Hungary, but we certainly had these
I think now we have something from IKEA
Yes they absolutely are a thing in Hungary, my gandmother had a frabric cutter as others said, but we also had simple big ones (two) and a small one, now my mom also has two big scissors and basically we had one lying somewhere at all of my jobs, they're pretty great
It wouldnt
Unless if im missing something
Which would be really embarassing lol
It wouldn't
Yes, with plums, but my family often makes them with cherries
In Hungary they are rolled in them, and there's some on the side
It's the finely ground stuff you'd use for breading
Do you have the cottage cheese/Quark dumplings in CZ
The dough is with semolina, not potatoes
It's pretty much mandatory to eat that with sweetened sour cream, it's great
At 11:45 pm I'd probably eat something that the bar has to offer or order a pizza
At 3:00 am I'd be drunk enough to go for a cheap Döner Kebab that will give me a bad stomach the next day
Probably some sort of döner or burger, and then I'd go back right to the pub/bar, 11:45 is way too early
The Parliament building and the Chain Bridge are probably the top2
The former is included in Civilization VI, the latter is on our 200 Ft coin
Other noteworthy landmarks are Buda Castle, Saint Stephen's Basilica, the Gellért Hill Citadel, Heroes' Square, Andrássy Road
Outside Budapest, the basilicas of Esztergom and Szeged, the village Hollókő, the Hortobágy Nine-Hole Bridge, as well as various castles (e.g. Eger, Sümeg) and châteaus (e.g. Nagycenk, Gödöllő) come to my mind
What a good question op, let me just say I’m sure nobody would guess but it’s definitely our parliament, the most beautiful in Eur— wait what’s this comment here
You have the world's largest parliament building - and the church on the other side of the road is larger
:-D
Thanks, i built it myself
Choose the width of the tire depending on the roads - thin tire are less effort but might be a problem with potholes
The number of gears depends also on the terrain - for some places 3-7 are enough, I usually don't mind having 18-21 when going up
Driving in traffic is mainly practice, a few suggestions:
-always watch your back
-keep at least a door distance from parking cars, and watch them if they want to start
-don't use the very far end of the road, if there's a pothole with a car on your left it's dangerous
-in a roundabout go in the middle - it's probably against the law, but many drivers might have the idea that they can leave easily before you when they actually can't
-when going forward in a crossing always, ALWAYS check your back if somebody wants to go right, trucks might not notice you
-please do stop at red lights
-always have working lights and brakes
In Hungary there is two big parties in commute bikers
The first one uses super old bikes from the ‘70s-‘80’s mostly from East Germany or Austria
These people are usually live in smaller cities and young people in Budapest who don’t want to spend so much on a bike
My first adult bike was a [Puch] Clubman, I used it for 10 years during University and my first job, loved it, brought me everywhere
The second group is people with new bikes designed for a bit rough roads, mostly fitness bikes
These bikes a bit more expensive, but better to ride in out shitty Eastern-European roads
They are easier to fix because there are more spare parts on the market
Fucking bullshit
I've been there many times
I can count it on one hand
It's 14
Eurasian catfish can grow up to 300kg
However it rarely reachey that age as people fish it for its tasty meat
As such specimens over 50-60kg are rare, and mostly found in places like Chernobil exculsion zone, where its dumb to eat them, and places like the delta of the Po river in Italy, as italians don't eat freshwater fish often
The real intresting (and scary) part is that they are very common, found ineven relatively small ponds - and the biigest ones tend to come from suc unexpected places as people dont go catfishing in the unaccesible small pond
It was free from 895 to 1541, then partially free until 1699, completely free by 1718
It remained to be free until 1849, when it came under foreign rule, which lasted until 1860
In 1867, the country entered into a real union with Austria, which meant giving up some of our sovereignty to common institutions with them
Despite this, I would still say this era was free
This era lasted 'til 1918, when Austria-Hungary collapsed after more than four years of total war, with complete isolation from international markets
After the Treaty of Trianon, the remaint rump of the country was free, the rest, well
it's controversial
After the fall of France in 1940, the country grew increasingly dependent on the whims of Germany, and in 1944, the country was first occupied, then a coup installed a nazi puppet regime
After the war, the country was under heavy Soviet influence, but was more or less free until 1949, when the communists took over completely
We remained a Soviet satellite until 1989, with the brief exception of a few days in 1956, but then once again, we became independent
In 2004, we joined the EU, and similar to the case of Austria-Hungary, gave up some of our sovereignty
I would still consider ourselves to be free though
11th century (?) - 1463 (Ottoman rule)
Idk, you were kinda Hungarian vassals for a good portion of that time
Belgrad
We were there for a day on our trip to Montenegro and it was such a mess of a city
They are kinda rebuilding it but in a soviet-esque fashion, and half of the city is like ruins and half of it is this kind of a construction site and cigarette butts
Athens
Dirty, loud, unliveable, a lot of closed shops, run down tenements
I mean it has its breathtakingly wonderful parts, but most of the city is sad to look at
Hmm, I loved Warsaw
Agreed
There are far better places all around Ireland, two days in Dublin were fine, trinity college, Guinness museum, dinner in Howth but the countryside was far more interesting
Also Galway was not that great either (though the surrounding region is charming)
Came here to say this
There´s just literally nothing nice in Milan besides that one dome that you actually find in every major European city
Wierd, I absolutely loved Athens last year when I was visiting
Although I’m a sucker for ancient Greek ruins and museums so I was having a blast
Agree on Thessaloniki though, it’s just a city, not too many interesting things there
Just out of curiosity, why would you caution against Athens
Yeah the center was pretty good, but it was just so hard to find it, and we didn't find it that big, maybe we were clueless there
>Maybe the guy drunk who threw up right next to me
What does that drunk guy have to do with Krakau
I visited Krakau many times, one was nicer than the other
The Rynek, Wawel, the narrow streets, the beautiful girls, all made a very good impression on me
You'd be served without a second thought
Maybe they'd be surprised a bit that you don't know already your cheapest options, but that's all
There used to be legends about the thing called 'The Twist',where the bartender would swipe the counter, and squeeze the content of the rug into a glass - that came with a symbolic price
I doubt you could still get it, even if it ever existed
I did not work in a bar, however I have worked in many other places where I served/sold things
I dont really give a shit about what you ask for, I just want to serve you as fast as possible
usually, the first year of studying history is just ancient cultures
i believe we start off with sumer and those stuff, a little bit of india and china, most focused on religion, egypt a bit more than the previous ones
all these wraps up in like a month or two
im sure they've mentioned a few others but first, im not too sure about my english when it comes to ancient cultures and second, im just not sure
and then obviously greek and roman history for the rest of the year, very in-depth
Mesopotamia, Egypt, Ancient Greece, Persians, Macedonia, Phonecia, Assyria, Judea, Rome, China
Greece and Rome is discussed in great detail, several weeks spent learning on them, the rest are usually only talked about for one class or two, maybe even less
Those civilizations who're mentioned but not taught too deeply about; Japan, Mesoamericans and various important tribes all across Europe/Asia
They are sorta just mentioned that they existed for a long time but nothing too concrete is said about them
\>  i believe we start off with sumer and those stuff
I think history classes start from the homo erectus and their friends, but anyway
Phoenician alphabet is surely mentioned, too
If I would have to say one, then it might be Ireland
I'm just simply not interested
That's really weird
I never in my life heard anyone refer to Orbán as mister
Even the pain in the ass hard line conservatives call him just Orbán.
You see, I'm neither really sociable nor a lover of whiskey, sadly
Castles might be interesting, though
Ofcourse, it just simply falls behind in priority
In Hungarian we say "isten háta mögött"-behind gods back
We used to but now just refer to Moscow
Some phrases:
“Isten háta mögött” - Behind God’s back
“A halál faszán” - On death’s dick
“Kinn a francban” - Out in the heck
There are also some imaginary generic village names originating from taxi drivers I believe
Further than the Glass-mountain
Further than where the deaf-tailed pig dugs
Further then the "óperenciás"-sea
Folk Tales usually starts with theese senteces, some people use theese in the colloquial as well
Or a halál faszán which is much more vulgar and it means "on the dick of death"
I'd check the relevant laws first, nonexistence might not be a valid reason to stop paying
Nothing
I'm shocked
We didn't even hear about the one in Netherlands
no, but i saw it on 4chan
Just have a pack of cigs or 200HUF on you and youll be fine
>Only pistols and non-automatic guns are allowed
...allowing fully automatic guns is pretty pointless
As their utilization requires IMMENSE ammounts of training - which is why almost all armies reserve them for specialist units, and use semi automatic rifles with reduced propellant, called "assault rifles".
Are gun ranges allowed to keep full auto stuff and the like in Litvania too
Here in Hungary private citizens cannot have that, but you can shoot it at a range if the range has it
>Also, in Austria every unblemished adult person can own guns for self defence
**Thats unheard of, in most European countries
The Checz guys said the exact same thing
>Militaries generally don't use reduced propellant either
NATO loads are pretty high compared to most civilian loads
NATO militaries use the 5,56x45mm cartridge which is a "intermediate cartridge".
Thats an intermediat power cartridge, lexactly like the ones used in the east for teh AK family of rifles
Intermediate in the sense that its not a full powered rifle cartridge
Which is why something like an M16 is MUCH easier to control something like a fallschirmjägergewehr
Reduced recoil is great when you need to hit stuff
&#x200B;
>Almost all armies issue "select fire" rifles to general infanterists
Select fire means, you can switch between full-auto and semi-auto
I meant that operating procedures tend to strongly discourage utilizing the full-auto function even when present
As its more often than not results in wasting ammunition
This is not an issue if you are chivalriously fighting an insurgency from a postion of power, and you need supressive power to reduce the number of deaths on all sides
However its a very ineffective tactic if you want to achieve an objective
As all parties hunkering down to be protected from the blind "spray and pray" method is not exactly conducive to capturing objectives or movement in general
&#x200B;
>Which armies are you talking about
Almost all armies stopped issuing submachineguns / machine pistols outside specialist units
And now even the last refuge of these weapons - outside specialist units - is disappearing due to PDWs
We also have a legal category that allows owning guns for self defense
We had it even in the old commie days
But the "tradtion" was back then to only issue such permits for politicans and judges
And that tradition is with us even today
So in principle you can own guns for self defense
However in practice you wont get a permit
Again in theory it should be automatically issued, unless there are extenuating circumstances like prior criminal record ...etc
However police can came up with excuses, up to but not limited to "we can adequatly assure protection without issuing permit".
Our word for *pattern* comes from the Sami language
A linguist called János Sajnovics studies the Finno-ugric connection when he stumbled upon the word *minta*. He though it was an ancient Finno-ugric word as in Hungarian minta can be constructed as "mint a", meaning "like a [something]", a perfect word to represent "pattern".
In reality, "minta" came to Sami from the Norwegian "mynte", which in turn has a latin origin
You can find it in English too, in coin *mint*ing
The word "kocsi" is the slangish way of saying car over here
Why, you ask
Simple
The first cars were manufactured in the town of Kocs
In Hungarian, putting an -i to something means that its from there
Thus, people started calling them "the things from Kocs"
We have to learn a lot, which is impossible for some people
Not just every movement, person and date in Hungarian history, but also how the Athenian democracy worked, how ancient Greece came to be, what happened to it until the Roman conquest, it's internal and external relations, the life and campaigns of Alexander the Great etc etc
And it's just a tiny fraction of the expected knowledge
You have to learn everything twice
Elementary school takes 8 years (from age 6 to age 15-ish), High School (we call it Middle school) takes 4 years
You had your first history class in 5th class, beginning from the Stone Age until the fall of Rome
Same as the Highschool one, but with less not-so-significant things
Then you roll into Highschool and have to relearn everything, but with more stuff
Roman Republic internal structure, How did the Macedon Phalanx worked, Charlemagne, Colonization around the world, slavery, American Independence War and the Civil War, every fkin war in Europe, Kings, philosophers, statesmans, warlords, generals, members of the clergy, artists, admirals, politicians in Europe and in sometimes in the USA too, Opium wars, every single theatre of the WW2 with battles, dates and generals, you have to compare different dictatorships and political systems etc etc
And oh boy things can be difficult for someone who is uninterested in history
In the final exam of advanced history class I had to write a test, a short essay about fascist and nazi propaganda machine (half a page), a long essay about something I don't remember (at least one page), and a complex essay about the Chinese political system, internal and external relations, and wars from the mid 19th century to 1990
The test had questions about the bible, the first king of Hungary and his laws, the reformation, Soviet propaganda posters, the first years of Austria-Hungary, the interwar period, the Islam and it's origins, the Reformation, Hungarian domestic politics in the late 19th century, the Aftermath of WW1 around the globe and the stock market crash of 1929
And it was considered as an easy exam
And this is just History classes
Our system needs a massive rework, it just doesn't work
We not only learn the history of Hungary, but a LOT of world history, i would say more than half of the time is spent learning about other stuff
Of course once we have our country to talk about, onwards most of the time is spent learning about local event as opposed to whats going on in china in similar detail
At the end of the day the goal of teaching history in state sponsored education is always the same
To encourage the growth of nationalist/patriotic sentiment and blind fanaticism towards your country
Stuff that is contrary to this goal is simply omitted from the curriculum
We have 12 years of pre-university education
If you go to a bilingual secondary school, it is one more year (starts with a year of intensive language education)
You can start secondary school after grade 4, grade 6, and grade 8 (the latter is the most common option
We start primary school at 6/7 years, so this means that you go to university at around 18-20 years old, depending on your birthday and which education model you choose
Education is compulsory until age 16 (used to be 18, changed a few years ago)
Pre-Kindergarden (optional): 1-2 yrs
Kindergarden: 3-4 yrs
Elementary school: 8 yrs
High/Middle/Gymnasium: 4-6 yrs
University: 4(-5) yrs
So I'll go to university at around the age of 20
Also, H/M/G can last up to 6 yrs because at the start you may have a NyEK (Nyelvi ElőKészítő) year which focuses on the language you already know (usually English) and your second language that you just started (German, Russian, French etc)
Also at the end you might get another year, if you're leaning a profession
If your parents decide you can stay an extra year in kindergarden
>Because it *is* really short
I think this is most heavily felt in math, where you just do not learn everything you'd need to know to start studying at a university in that direction anymore because the courses in the 13th year are missing
That isn't really the case - Oberstufe is 3 years, whether you are studying in the 8-year (G8) or the 9-year (G9) system
The extra year is inserted between year 5 and 9
(At least, that's the case in Hesse - it might be different in other states
And you wouldn't learn more stuff in that time
It just makes you learn the same stuff more slowly, which is good for bad students, but boringly unchallenging for good students
>  In my opinion it’s awful and Catalonia should be allowed an official referendum on their independence like Scotland was
Some other EU countries would never let it happen because they are afraid of similar referendums happening to them
I was born in a village orginally called Ötházhuta
It means something like Fivehomefurnace in English
And the reason they called it this way
Well it explains itself
Back in the 18th century 5 families founded the village, they lived in 5 houses and their profession was glassmith
The descendants of those families are still live in that village
Székesfehérvár - Seated White Fort
"White Fort" because it already had stone walls in an era, when wooden and earth fortifications were much more common in Hungary(10th century)
It was one of the first Hungarian cities, founded by Prince Géza, the father of our first king, Saint Stephen
"Seated" because it served as the first Capital of the country until the mid-12th century and as the exclusive coronation city until the mid-16th century
Falu means village in Hungarian, but I doubt there’d be any relation (at least for this word, that is)
Doesn't that mean spiders, too
Well, I'm currently learning Dutch and it's apparently the same there
Corvinus University in Budapest, Eötvös Loránd University(also in Budapest), and the University of Szeged
We have a half-man, half-fish legendary creature: _Istók Hany_.
He was a boy who was found in the vast swamp of Hanság (hence his name)
But his skin was greenish, he had scales and webbings
He couldn't speak, he rather produced gargling sounds, and didn't like to wear clothes
He was christianed and taken to the court of the local landlord
He grew up there, and fitted in more or less
His only friend was the daughter of the landlord, and he fell in love with her
On the day of the girl's wedding (with a normal human), he wanted to show his love, and brought a huge basket full of frogs
He poured it onto the table, all the guests were frightened and disgusted
He was very much scolded and beaten, even the girl was angry at him
After that, in great sorrow, he vanished, and nobody ever saw him again
I know this is not the same vodník like in _Rusalka_, but this is the closest we have
Superbad
Buying booze not gonna make you cool in eastern europe
You just walk in to the nearest grocery store and if youre past 14 you are good to go
Since different pricing and quality vexes so many people in Eastern Europe, food regulations
But that would mean giving up rights for a centralized institution and legislation, and the complainers hate that idea as well
It was made obligatory in Hungary in the recent years
In many countries you always have to drive with headlights on
We've got the same in Hungary
You roll them in roasted bread crumbs once cooked
My favourite childhood food with some powdered sugar and ground cinnamon on the top
Fisherman's soup recipes (what fish do you use
is there pasta in it
what kind of pasta
etc) definitely divide the country into at least 3 big groups and dozens of subgroups
That wether saying the accusative form of motor[motorbike/engine] as "motrot" is correct or not
Who even puts pasta in Fisherman's soup
Then there's the fourth group, who do not eat halászlé at all
It’s even more obscure that this was what hacking originally meant
The Netherlands
I love their architecture, their cities, their canals, their funny language and I love their open society
I wouldn't oppose it, but that would mean eroding some of the nation state mindset, which is an extremely touchy subject
This is the version I learned:
Fej, vállak, térd és talp; térd és talp
Fej, vállak, térd és talp, térd és talp
Szemek és fülek és orr és száj.
Fej, vállak, térd és talp; térd és talp
"Talp" is the side of the foot that touches the ground, I think the lady who taught us this just wanted it to sound better, might be "láb" (=leg) originally
The other part mean the same
EDIT: Actually, nose comes before the mouth here
I’ve never seen, heard or read that this existed in Hungarian
Clearly I mist have missed out on this as a child
[Viktor Orbán] or [Mátyás Rákosi]
Edit: Also [Béla Kun]
Well this is quite controversial over here
Orbán being disgraced is unfortunately just wishful thinking
He's still one of the most popular politicians in the country, no matter how much I and others want this not to be the case
Doesn't he basically have a cult on the right
In Hungary it's the original: rock paper scissors(kõ papír olló)
You forgot ceruza(pencil), faragó(sharpener) and vulkánkitörés(vulkanic eruption)
No idea what exactly the pencil and sharpener do, but the vulcanic eruption beats them all
About 210€ for my mom, my stepdad, and myself for a whole month
My mom cooks usually, sometimes I do so, and it involves breakfasts, lunches and dinners as well
Sometimes +/-10€ occasionally for pizza or something like that
The national average was 67
46€/month in 2017
That seems frighteningly low to me, I spend about 200€/month on food -- granted, I don't grow my own crops, live in a well-off household and eat healthily
I see soo few hungarians here
Same
Dunno why
Turns out people in the USA don't learn about the cold war
Yugoslavia was
I know you don't, I just heard some worrying things about your education system both from Americans and from classmates who were there as exchange students, so I dared presume history teaching isn't exactly great there
I was generalising a bit too much though, so I'm sorry
Yeah, you're right
I mean, for a brief time it was
I think it greatly depends on the teacher
I was fortunate enough to have had a great history teacher in high school
But I think the topics covered are also important, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that history teaching in the USA is too America-centered
It was different in every country
I grew up in Hungary and had a very peaceful childhood
We had everything we needed, middle class family, my mother did not work because I had two siblings, too
Went to the playground every day it was fun all the time, then went to school where we were required to be pioneers, sort of young communists with red scarf, bud did not wear it every day only at special events
It was known not to be allowed to talk about the revolution of 1956 or press freedom
I watched the news with my parents and it was always the same boring shit to me, bald fat old men in grey suits talking nonsense
When I became a teenager we started to long for western stuff like coca cola in a can or milka and stuff like that
But we knew about all the other stuff that was important like Modern Talking or Starsky and Hutch
My parents were in Vienna in the eighties and it was like a paradise to them
I was shortly in West-Berlin, like in heaven
We had good books, films, sports
Not everything was politics
As the end of 80´s came closer my parents got more and more nervous
2 years after the iron courains fall my dad got laid off
That´s how I anticipated it
Even though I did not live under the dictatorship I have heard many things about it
It was basicly a "soft or goulash dictatorship", it means that they bough the peace with welfare acts
Generally speaking we had it way better than our neighbours and therefore many people would like to go back especially with that terrible governments we had in the 1990s. But still it was a dictatorship even at the very end and people were often imprisoned and beaten for speaking
It has a certain nostalgia since in the 1990s we had a sort of "great depression" with GDP falling 20% and people saw Kádár's area as the "good old days"
Yes that was it
Thanks
I was in Romania before 1989
It was indeed horrible for both Hungarians and Romanians there
That kind of oppression is absolutely unimaginable for people born after the 80´s
&#x200B;
And yes, you´re right about Gulyás communism
It was all financed from credits from the west so that 1956 doesn´t happen again
Important are here the cans
We had bottles, too
I agree with you, but I would not call the late Kádár era as strictly planned economy, after the New Economical Mechanism (1968) it was rather a mixture
An economical system that still socialist and therefore not working but a bit more functional than other Eastern block countries
...not that we do have huge indoors unemployment (thanks to pointless state financed hobby projects, and social aid getting transformed into piss poorly paid hard physical labour - in the dig up a hole, to have something to fill in tomorrow, line of tradition), bloated administration, rampant theft, and corruption now that communism "ended".
All in all, nothing changed but the names of the rogues on the top
I mean, if you seen the anime titled black lagoon, and recall the self styled "vampire twins" well, they are based on romanian orphanages
Or just read up on bucharest progrom, and realize that the Iron Guard (the political party responsibld for the whole shebang) got incorporated into the red secret services
(hanging 5 year old kids on meathooks in butcher factories and raping them, was a tad bit excessive even by waffen SS standards - but according to the actions of commhnist romanian leadership, the action was fine, only they did it on the "wrong target" a mistake they were willing zo overlook)
Yes omg there was this really good Romanian film about it I saw ten years ago
>But only a fool can say that we lived better in yugoslavia than now
You are in denial
I hope you do relize that pretty much everone lives better now than back then
The information revolution played a large part in that
It allows stuff like not needing a person to manually connect landlines to call up your relatives (with the need to pay him included in the prices)
Or that noone does real prototyping, i mean to test stuff, its done with software based finite element modelling, cfd
etc
and noone needs to keep a small army of drawers to allow production
There is no way to have the features in your products at current prices without said tech
No matter the ideology, it simply didnt exist neither here neither in the west
>Yugoslavia could not compare in any way to the west
Depending on the part of west
Ireland during the Troubles, Italy during the Years of Lead , or francoist spain was a worse place to live
Naturally in non-planned economies you had more variety in products, at the price of stuff like US " health care system" & "education system" - which are dirty commie things to have
And while in the east you had corruption (due to unchecked government power, why not sell out after all
), in the west you had crime waves facilitated to create untraceable credits for the secret services
And stuff like decades long experiments on the effects of syphilis, or meth on random citizens
And of course you could look at places like Argentina, which was at the life quality of Germany or Uk if they skipped the wars, which got completely and utterly fucked due to being the US's backyard, the same way Romania & Albania were the USSR's backyard
One of my favourite hungarian idiom is "To act like he/she shat the spanish wax" (úgy viselkedik mintha ő szarta volna a spanyol viaszt) it means acting all proud and arrogant even tough achieving nothing/or completing something very trivial
Or "to beat the stinging nettle with someone else's dick" (más faszával veri a csilánt) meaning to speak on other's behalf/do something that endangers them but not you
Or when somebody stands between you and the object that you want to watch(ie
TV) you can tell them "your father wasn't a glassman/glassmaker" implying that they in fact cannot be seen trough
And there is a lot more
These are from the tip of my tongue
You can't even really have conversation in English in the countryside of Hungary
(Maybe with young people)
Or else you'll be welcomed with people speaking Hungarian loudly and articulating hard in an attempt to make you understand it
As a Hungarian basically only to Transylvania
Besides ghat, Noone speaks this weird language
A lot of places in Slovakia, Romania and Serbia are fine in that respect
Even if the other side doesn't really speak Hungarian, most of the time, they know some certain keywords, which help a lot
Otherwise, German works quite well in Germanic countries (sans UK), while most Slavs can understand you if you speak in Russian to them
Lmao
You can't change it
It's just not goint to happen
And I assume that you're more of a "jány" than a "lány" lmao
Not the person you asked, but to add some anecdata, I stayed in Subotica/Szabadka, Serbia for around a month once and heard maybe one Hungarian speaker
Maybe
On the other hand, years ago, I often went just over the border to Slovakia and found Hungarian speakers fairly easily
In parts of Transylvania, though, you don't even have to search for them; they're everywhere
Fun-fact, there is a sizeable amount of people who believe the whole thing is made up by the Austrians as sort of a propaganda to let us believe we are lesser people
Many people also believe there is more similarity in turkish languages than in Finnish and Hungarian, Turkish people are looking at us as brothers
Well, some of them
That's basically a "lány" in a dialect that generally old people/villagers use
My grandma would probably call you "a jány" I assumed that so does your SO's granny
*jány*, *lyány*, *leány* and *lány* are all variants of the same word
standard hungarian only uses the last one, but there are various dialects which might use the others
I live in Kőszeg, Hungary, about five minutes away from the Austrian border
Ima tell you, it's like there's not even a border
You don't need any papers, no slowing down, it's like you're not even leaving the country, but you know you're in Austria because the roads are better
Although there is a checkpoint, you very rarely get checked, only if you're suspicious (like you have a body in the trunk, or something similar)
Went to austria from hungary during the immigration crisis
There was a small stop with a police officer
We only needed to prove him we are eu citizens, after that we continued our journey
Lasted 3 mins or less
Every other occasion there was 0 border control, not even a slowdown
The border with Slovakia is the Danube
There is a bridge
It's like any other bridge, except it says the other side is Slovakia
There is a checkpoint to Austria, but nothing really happens there
>Schengen allows you to do a lot of things which would be harder or even impossible to do in other countries, like
>Work in country a and live in country b, as living in country b is cheaper
>Buy groceries in another country
>Take a day trip to another country
>etc
Depends
Nordic countries managed to do it fine
Same with Hungary & Croatia (i am unsure about the living & working part, but plenty people done the latter for a long time, as passport is not needed - there is also a very nice restaurant just on the other side of the border close to my hometown)
When I went to Austria a few years ago we didn't even have to stop
All we noticed is that our mobile data is gone because roaming wasn't turned on

HAHAHAHA HUNGARY = HUNGRY HAHAHAHAHA SO FUNNY
I live in Belgium for 10 years now
I understand
Let me give you an example
Last year they have renovated the pavement in front of the house and they put some plants next to the road
So that the plants start to grow, the local commune ordered watering the young plants every week on Saturday
Now it was raining heavily twice, but they still came and watered the plant
r/fosttalicska in a nutshell
I mean we honestly are not even really aware of it, so we can’t really hate it
Can you tell us some jokes about us
Mostly about the Scots being tight and drunk
Adjonisten Fostársam
Son to his father:
-I saved a pound by running next to the tram
(slaps the kid)
-You could save ten if you'd run next to a taxi
21-22°C right now
Under 20° it would be a bit cold
5C/74F
Below 20C/68F would be cool/cold if I use the two words synonymously
0°C. The whole house is around that temperature (maybe 1-1
5°C colder at the entrance or the kitchen), as all the doors are open
What kind of bullshit law is that
There'd be a revolt here if they tried to pass something like that
Is it still the norm to not install any heating and have the crappiest insulation for flats in Portugal
When I was visiting friends during the winter, I was freezing my ass off and they were asking where's my thick sweater to wear indoors, lol
But the building looked like it was at least 50 years old

Not related, but one of my favourite new word is 'egérmozi' (mouse cinema), means watching movie/tv on a phone
Interesting, I haven't heard that one yet
I'm a night owl and my hobby is taking long walks at night
The city I was currently at never stopped me here in Hungary
Well now it isn't (national mandatory curfew after 20:00)
Apart from that it's pretty safe except some minor parts where \*certain\* people live
I used to go for a longer walk every day just to get refreshed
Why tho
Can you tell me exactly which subareas of Copenhagen are we talking about
Hopefully I will study at DTU from September so I'm interested in Copenhagen
Back in the middle ages the King of Hungary was coronated in my city
The Diet of Hungary was held in my hometown in 1708
And also Saint Elisabeth is claimed to be born here as well
My hometown was the HQ of Horthy after he left Szeged with the National Army
Yes, yes it is
The coronations only stopped being here when the Turks took over
Nono, it's Székesfehérvár, before the 16
Century all but two hungarian Kings were crowned in the basilica
Hungarian word on the left with its meaning on the right:
"Hold" = moon
"Nap" = sun (or day)
"Toll" = pen (or feather)
"Eleven" = lively
"Part" = shore
"Lap" = sheet of paper
'Here' means testicle in Hungarian
One of my first big language shocks was when Israeli relatives visited my family like ten or so years ago, with two little kids
Who, being little kids, made a lot of noise, prompting their mom to repeatedly tell them "dai" (די, "enough")
I didn't know a lick of Hebrew, so I was quite shocked that she was telling her kids to die over a little noise
Hold means Moon in Hungarian
Not any that I can think of right now, but
Cár instead of car would be 'tsar'
Tó instead of to would be 'lake'
Same
They are rare, but they are there:P
Don't climb on the statues

> Just only be yourself and act decent then everything is fine
That is a contradiction at many people
I just ended my inter-national relationship 2 days ago and this question comes up :((
We do two
One for each cheek
just like in hungary :)
Europe is Paris, Rome and Amsterdam
When I went to Mexico, some dude believed that all Europeans are blonde with blue eyes
I asked him if the Spaniards are like that and he told me that it's because of the Arabs, otherwise they'd be all blonde with blue eyes too
I was speechless
Seriously this
I mean we do the kiss on the cheek greeting here, but that's only for family and close friends at best
Also a kiss on the cheek being so scandalous for Americans is just mind boggling
i mean the godless part is mainly true fortunately
I purchased two in a market in Bucharest, they are good housewives
Marxist construct with dedicated places for business lobby, good one
In no god we trust
In Budapest there are very differently priced housing units based on location
For that much you can buy a 65m^2 flat with panorama and a huge balcony on Gellért Hill,  same sized flat in an inner district or a 550m^2 house with huge garden in an outer district
Ah, a fellow Hungarian
How are you man
We call it a shell-toad as well, "teknősbéka"
There are some of these in hungarian as well
Wolf is "farkas" (literally "one with a tail"), and stag is "szarvas" (literally "one with horns")
The widely accepted theory is that this is due to the nomadic origin og the hungarians, as our ancestors probably held these animals in high regard, and thought it blasphemous to refer to them by their "true" name, so instead they just described them
Dehogy, mindent a saját nyelvünkön írunk, aztán majd a reddit app lefordítja nekünk angolra
Edit: oops, looks like the translator plugin broke again
subs = U-Booten
Genau richtig gemacht
In Hungary, we have “földszint” which literally means ground level
Then above that, you have 1st floor and onwards
Strange exception is “szuterén”, which refers to apartments below ground floor (often with small windows and little light)
I see this is being used way too often here in Denmark, I assume because they are cheaper - hope a Dane can clarify that
Edit: We also have “magasföldszint” which translates to elevated ground floor
These are the ground floors which are placed a bit higher than the ground level but not high enough you’d designate them as a proper 1st floor
In hungary the first floor is the one above street level, in elevators the street level floor is usually 0 or F (földszint)
In slovakia the first floor is also the one above street level, the street level floor in elevators is marked sometimes 0 but mostly P (prízemie)
Hungary has a lot, but in my opinion the most famous is Rubik's cube
It was invented by Rubik Ernő a Hungarian sculpture/toy designer
But Hungarians invented dynamo, telephone exchange and ballpoint pen too
Rubic's Cube
The  ballpoint pen, the rubiks cube, safety match, vitamin C, tungsten lamp, the first helicopter, telephone exchange
Source:
One Rubik Ernő invented the rubiks cube, the other designed glider planes, like the Góbé. They were father and son
Safety match (János Irinyi), nuclear bomb (Ede Teller), high-voltage three phase alternating current motors and generators for electric locomotives (Kálmán Kandó), Ford T-model (József Galamb), computer (János Neumann), holography (Dénes Gábor)
Some important ones
Well, Ányos Jedlik discovered it 5 years earlier, his only problem was that he didnt patent it
Siemens patented it after discovering it too
You're right, my bad
Sleep deprivation didn't help me yesterday
We have two cities called Dunaújváros (New Danube City) and Tiszaújváros (New Tisza City) on Hungary's two big rivers, the Danube and the Tisza
They were originally communist planned cities, and they were named
Sztálinváros (Stalin City) and Leninváros (Lenin City)
Hungary's counties' names usually don't make sense
But there's one county (Békés) which basically means 'Peaceful'
Looking forward to finding out exactly who voted for and against it
The official website of the EP does not have the results yet, at least as far as I can see
If anyone has the detailed information, don't hesitate to share
I hope that it will be implemented in a way that our anti-piracy laws are implemented
The law is technically there, but no one cares about its enforcement
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Otherwise we might see Youtube, Twitter, Twitch, and other services blocked in europe
YouTube already has automatic content filters
They are way ahead of the EU - in fact, those opposing the Copyright Directive often cited YouTube's content ID system as a deterrent
The same voters send the same people to the EP
National sovereignty in action
Yes, unfortunately
When net neutrality was enshrined, I thought we were on the right track
This is a huge step backwards
Thanks
So Fidesz, as expected, voted for it, as did one of our Socialists
Two of our S&D members as well as one Green and one independent voted against
Trust the government to be on the wrong side, of course
The automatic filters are too easy to fool
I doubt they would rely on it if they could go to court over its mistakes
They certainly won't MANUALLY filter every piece of content
That's impossible
I'm not sure what your point is here
They are both issues related to the concept of the free and open internet
In one of them, the EU made positive directives; in the other, it fucked up
Well, depends on how it's enforced and how hard they get punished for a violation
If the free uploads cause too much hassle and fines, they might lock it all down to pre-approved content (i.e professional studios and shows)
Or maybe ask for a "copyright deposit" for uploading
Who knows yet
I highly doubt we would get that far, though
I want to believe this would all be a technicality
Well some people do put ketchup (hell some heretics even put mustard) on their pizza, but its quiet uncommon
(If the thing can honestly qualify as pizza - my grandma makes magnificent meat pies however those are not "pizza" regardless of shape)
And now garlic oil on pizza is definietly not a thing here
However "Lángos" could qualify as the "hungarian pizza with the fruits fo the cow" - and thats eaten with garic oil pretty freqently
But
But think about the poor college kids living in dormitories, supported by their parents, who think that around €90 a MONTH is enough to eat well in the capital (Budapest)
(And saying things like you don't need to work, your job is to study, but when you want like €20 more, cuz the only things you can afford are ketchup pasta and mayo rice, they tell you to find a job
) Sorry for the rant
Tuna ain't cheap, at least not here in Hungary
Probably has something to do with diastance, and the fact that right now there are quots on fishing it, s it hs been fished into extinctin in the mediterranean, and the stock is slowly strting to replenish right now
Depends on the kind, you could go for the original, which is pretty much "garum - chinese edition"
Cons:  bad hospitals, bad roads, corrupt politicans, brainwashing propaganda, low wages, devolving economy,
Pros: Pálinka
Pros: good culture, good food, gorgeous girls
cons: wages, healthcare, education, thus a declining population, corruption, political based disagreements nearly always violent and disrespectful for the other side
Pros: Good food and drinks, beautiful landscapes
Cons: Toxic xenophobic old people and shitty politics
No, never heard about such, neither for legal abortions or having an abortion in general
Angyalcsináló. Angel maker were their names
My 5 favourite is:
Het Wilhelmus (Anthem of the Netherlands)
Amhrán na bhFiann (Anthem of Ireland)
Mazurek Dąbrowskiego (Anthem of Poland)
Deşteaptă-te, române
(Anthem of Romania)
Das Deutschlandlied (The 1st stanza of the anthem of Germany)
Warsavianka
A lot of "communist" song i learned as a child are pretty good song to sing
It’s definitely a heavy critique, but still patriotic - [DDT’s Rodina] (Motherland)
“How many years I’ve chewed, instead of bread, raw love
I love Bella Ciao, it's a great song with a lot if emotional background
Your flair says other wise
The first thing that came to my mind was the [red mud catastrophe] from 2010
It was one of the biggest industrial accident in Hungarian history, 10 people died, 150 other were injured and the environment was hurt deeply
People lost their loved ones, their houses, cars, everything
Looking back at the videos and the pictures about what happened is still so heartbreaking
Probably the "Toxic Red Spludge Spill" in 2010
october 04
You can still see the red lines on trees and some buildings
The world is full with red mud storage ponds, pools etc
It can happen at any time and happened before the hungarian disaster
I read an article, which I can't find right now for some reason, a year or so ago where a journalist with some scientists went down to the affected villages and took some water and soil samples and from what I can remember some of the results were still not great
This is the first I heard about this Molasses Flood, this sounds terrible too
In hungary, you'll mostly see it at tourist attractions, events and festivals
I love it, but people only eats it on vacations and stuff
Never known anyone who makes it at home for themselves
However, I can confirm we eat this really often
Well I don´t know if you´re aware of it, but we call Italians cat-eaters
I know we shouldn´t. I also think you don´t eat cats very often
I was pretty sure this dates way back
We have these:
If you sit on a chair at the corner of the table, you won't get married
If you step on someone's heels, you will live to see their wedding day
If your right hand is itching, you will receive money, but if your left hand is itching, you will lose or spend money
On new years day you have to eat lentils so that you will be rich throughout the new year, (lentils representing coins)
Do for this reason, during new years' lentils are cheap at the supermarket, a lot of people are buying it to make a vegetable stew out of it
If on St
Katherines day (25th of November) the weather is very cold, then Christmas will be warm and there will be no snow, and vice versa, if 25th of November has mild, warm weather, Christmas will be cold and snowy
You should never give a knife as a gift to someone
If you ask for medicine, and someone gives you a pill, you should not say thank you, because then the medicine will not work
If you spill some salt, there will be an argument or a fight in your home
Also:
The fights caused by spilling salt can be avoided if you throw a little behind your shoulder
If you hit your elbow, you'll have unexpected guests
If you give someone a wallet as a gift, you always have to put a little money in it - symbolizing that the wallet will never be empty
If your left eye is itching, you will laugh, but if your right eye is itching, you will cry
If your nose is itching, you will be angry soon
If you sneeze while speaking, it's a sign that you are saying the truth
If you kill a spider, you will have bad luck
On new years day you can ear pork since pigs rooting the luck, but you cannot eat poultry because they will fly away with your luck
If you are pointing at something or someone publicly, you will steal in the future
If a glass cracks by itself or a clock stops, someone will die
If swallows make nest under your roof, your hose will never burn down
If you and another person say the same thing at the same time (unintended), you both will be lucky
If someone has a hiccup, they are talked about someplace else
If you see someone dying in your dreams, they will have a long life, but if there's a bride in your dreams, someone will die
Didn't have folders either
If we are speaking notebooks,
red is squares (sciences)
blue is lines (humanities)
green is empty (arts or whatever, geometry for math, lots of drawing for biology, basically for subjects where you need to draw a lot)
pink is staff/stave (?) (music)
Those are all I've ever seen
We used to use
used (lol) books in the not so distant past, but now it's just as you described - new books every single year, sometimes all they change is just a few lines in some pages or slightly alter the order of the chapters, it's so stupid and wasteful
10 years ago I could use either the books I got from my siblings or get a used one for free from the library - often there were a more than dozen students listed as previous owners and the book was fine
Now you can't even use last years edition
The government has a monopoly on alcoholic drinks and cigarettes
Also the most popular TV channels and news outlets are owned or funded by the government
Unfortunately, none of that is unique to the Netherlands
It's a disease of neoliberalism
Well guys, the same thing goes for Hungary-Germany
German wages are way better, than Hungarian ones, let alone the livelihood
But sure, the neighbor's grass is always greener
Even little villages in Hungary
Well, I won't deny that the commenters of a specific subreddit are all in favour of more affordable housing
What I'm saying is that under the Thatcher/Reagan-type economic policies this sort of housing crisis is inevitable
If the market is not regulated in an effective way - and neocons/neolibs abhor all regulation that infringes on the ability to make tons of money - then it's very easy for investors to create artificial scarcity on the market, drive up the prices and cash in
That's not a big deal if they do it with, say, beach balls
If beach balls become unreasonably expensive because a few wealthy individuals/companies corner the market, that's no big deal because really, you don't need beach balls, just don't buy them
But you have to live SOMEWHERE, and your choices are limited by employment opportunities
I'm not sure what the sensible and effective regulations would be
Because - and here's my problem with blaming government limitations as you and neolibs tend to do - housing prices are skyrocketing pretty much everywhere, despite wildly differing rules and regulations
Average property prices in Budapest increased by 63% over the last four years
That's insane
Rent doubled over the last five years
Wages did not grow at a pace even remotely close to that
And we have a very different government than that of the Netherlands - what is common is the prevailing economic system
Regions which no longer belong to us have the best reputation, since they are idolised by nationalism
Otherwise, Győr-Moson-Sopron County is probably the most liked county in general
Compared to the rest of the country it's clean and wealthy
Lol, I kinda feel sad about this tho
Don't take it the wrong way, it's just that place is still so hungarian
People saying they don't wear any special clothes in -20 degrees only jeans and thsirt
And here I am wearing thighs under the jeans, 2 socks, winter boots, 3-4 layers of upper body clothing (under top, long sleeve shirt, light  sweater, then warm sweater), winter coats, scarf, hats, gloves even when it drops under 0 degrees lol
Though I'm not living in a northern country
Very rarely and mostly when it's only for my myself
Most of the time I use English because that's the used language anyway and I find myself speaking English more than my first language
English, except rant-style debug logs which are of course Hungarian
Both
Our business logic uses words that have no English counterpart, so most of the logic related stuffs are in Hungarian
Functions and methods are funnier, because they should be in English, but also should reflect the logic behind them, so mixed names are quite common
Purely architecture related things are strictly in English though
The nearest supermarket to my home is a Lidl (300 m)
I like it very much
The prices are OK, the staff is much more competent than in most supermarkets and hypermarkets
The quality is constantly high, the weeks about nations (like Greek/American/German/French etc
Food Weeks) are good; but the variety otherwise is very flat, it is very rare that they introduce a new product
They sell fresh produced baked goods
Most of our day to day shoppings are done there
Another competitor is Aldi (in some countries: Hofer)
There's an Aldi 1 km away
I go there sometimes, if I want to buy a specific product I can't buy in Lidl (like high quality chicken nuggets)
Sounds like the supermarket revolution was seen everywhere
Years ago, it was Interspar that was acceptable and Tesco & Lidl were really really bad and cheap
Now both turned around, I think it was Tesco first, and then Lidl&Aldi became quite frankly the most popular mid-size shop in Hungary
Everyone I know shops at Lidl, literally neighbours of mine are meeting at the closest Lidl when we come home from work
> sold goods in the boxes they came in just stacked up on the floor
they still sell stuff in their boxes here but I dont mind it at all
Their shops look clean and organised though
In Hungary Aldi & Lidl are basically the same, selling the same stuff
You've met some odd Hungarians if they declared it in such a nonnegotiable way
Sure, being friends with the same sex is more  common, but life doesn't filter out interesting people by sex, so if you do it willingly, that speaks of your own values rather than society's.
Funny you say that
I'm Hungarian, female,  lived here all my life, and I'm now having a serious clash of values about this exact same thing with one of my female friends, whose boyfriend also happens to be my friend and collegue
She got it into her head that (even though she trusts me, she says), that I'm basically a liability in her relationship and that makes her uncomfortable
Says it doesn't fit her "worldview" that her boyfriend considers me, a friend or any friend, just as important as his girlfriend
She then gave him some sort of ultimatum about “what's more important". They broke up just yesterday
I was honestly shocked by this "worldview" from the Middle Ages and how many people supported her in this conspiracy theory
We're in our twenties
Me and his boyfriend are village people, she and her rocket scientist "council" are from Budapest
I never encountered such a clash about something I considered normal in my life before
So yeah, it was shocking to me to realize how deep of a divide exists about this in my own society as well
Ehm
I’ve always had friends from the opposite gender since kindergarten and I didn’t get impression that we’ve had any kind of segregation, even guys who are into macho culture and conservative towards gender roles in my experience generally have female friends
As Hungarian I honestly can’t really relate to what you’ve described
As you wrote in one your comments, it might be age though
But honestly I’d considered this weird for people in their 40s-50s as well
My parents are that age also they literally grew up in bumfuck nowhere rural Hungary and even for them it’s totally normal and common to have opposite gendered friends
Only generation where I would consider this kind of segregation normal and nothing out of the ordinary is among people over 70
I am 19 years and Hungarian
I have many female friebds with whom I often go out
I call bs on what you have writteny at least in Budapest
I have female friends, but they are not going to do anything as often as the male ones
As every other Hungarian in this thread said, this is nonsense
Hungary is not like that at all, there's no strict segregation of the sexes
What
I mean how old are you and your friend group
In my circles in Budapest being above thirty it is and its always been normal to have friends from both gender since like elementary
As a Hungarian in Hungary, i have got friends from the opposite sex and i have never had any problem or confusion from it
Yeah, it's definitely her insecurities, but that doesn't explain why so many of her acquaintances fueled them further with that conservative BS
It's possible
Though I'm still leaning towards some cultural bubble effect that I haven't been aware of
99% of the time I just say "halló" and vary the tone depending on who the caller is
1% of the time, when it's a close friend, I say "ja
"/"yep
"/"mondjad
"\[tell me\], or one of the memes we have for phone calls
Weirdly, I cannot take myself seriously enough to do the "\[full name\]" thing
To me, it would sound
pretentious
halló, tessék
means 'hello,what' (but it's a very polite way of saying what(
i never say my full name if i'm being called, i wait for the other party to introduce themselves
also, i don't answer private numbers (if you don't want me to see your number, it cannot be that important)
Not while talking on the phone at least
You start a sentence with it tho - when you want the other person to pay attention
Something like 'hey' in "Hey, look at this
" or something
895 when we settled where we are, 1001 when the country was founded
As a settled state it was founded at AD 1000 or 1001
But our ancestors crossed the mountains around 895
Our first king was crowned in 1000, but Hungarian tribes lived in the Carphatian region for a time (and raided as much as we could)
What about the Wallachia, it was essentially a Romanian country, wasn't it
Did Slovenian national indenitiy was part of the "Spring of Nations", like the Croatian and Hungarian one
So what do you learn in history lessons
What about the Treaty of Verdun(843)
It essentially established East Francia, which later evolved to be Germany as a separate realm
>Scotland inherited England, not the other way round
You mean the King of Scotland inherited the throne of England, right
We "christianized" in 1001, so he's right
True enough I guess
I see, we don't learn much about Slovenia at school for some reason
Sure but they are still very close to us, we learn about Slovakia too and they aren't much bigger either
Sure, it wasn't ever part of it but we learn about all the countries in region (and in generally Europe)
Finally someone is aware of the concept of personal unions
That's the best tactic
We should try to adopt this
Why on Earth would I ever need drywalls
I think most extended families have someone with a car trailer, and it's easy to find one to rent
We have a „share“ system here, in the sense that every family has a member or knows someone who owns a van or a small truck (not a pickup) and when someone needs it, they ask for it for the day
But almost everything can get delivered, in many cases it’s even free, you rarely need a truck more than twice a year therefore
Dajka, dada or dadus
But these are old-fashioned
We took the english babysitter and use it more frequently
Bébicsősz
Translation would be something like "hayward of babies".
Also we use the hungarianized version of babysitter: *bébiszitter*.
Yes, back in elementary school we did sometimes
I remember cooking in Arts class in primary school
Although I think we only made three things, pancakes, waffles and grilled vegetables
More interestingly in the second half of primary school and then in secondary school, every year around the end of the school year, we made goulash in cauldrons/pots (bogrács) outside, over open fire
Two of the lunch ladies and the vice-headmaster were adjudicating them, although my class never won
We have that here at our school as well but i know its not a thing all over the country
Never heard of this
SAE Institute lets you keep everything and actively helps with building your portfolio for easy job finding in the future
We already have an official holiday on the 15th so no, no such tradition exists here
It is very necessary to use the so called Flex (angle grinder) as early as possible on Sunday mornings
Or drill a hole into the wall, if you live in a flat (especially the socialist style with the thin walls), in the middle of the night
Only if its 2006 or older
> God damn it, how many pictures can one appartment hold
Not enough
I didn't know the expression "angle grinder" in English, so I had to look it up
It was an absolute surprise to me that Flex is one of the brands who sell this
We just use it as a common noun (like xerox or winchester in English)
I don't own one - according to the joke, I would be considered gay in the countryside
Hell yes
That goes without saying
This guy pictures
Like 10 minutes with car
In the past few weeks, it was quite simple
I only have to take one bus to get to my new university
It's at the edge of the city, so there's no jam either
While everyone tries to get to the centre, there's little to no traffic going in the opposite direction, so the bus is never late
Including the walk door-to-door, all of this takes max 40 minutes
Edit: Budapest, btw
7 minutes with bus + 10 minutes walk, or 30 minutes if I walk entirely
25 minutes walk or 15 mins by tram, but I usually walk
I really like Lydia (feminine) and Mateo (masculine)
There's Mateo in Hungarian as well (Máté) but that sounds lame compared to it
Bastian, i like german names
For male names, I would say Karl, Maximilian and Alexander are great
Japanese 夢 "yume", which literally means "dream"
Sergei, Boris, Igor, Nikolai, Aleksei, Vladimir, those are guys I would love to get drunk with
Hey, my name is Zoltán! I appreciate you liking my name
If i would have a son i would probably name him Felix it just sounds right
I'm not joking but it can be from 16 to 45
Is noone going to talk about the "after finishing the mandatory army at 20" part
We had a colony in a China as Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was a small part of a small city we got for taking part in the Opium wars
*Boxer Rebellion
My bad, I remember that it was the Second Opium War
Thanks
I think perhaps we can share that title together
Both were about screwing over China, minor mistake
It didn't happen to me, but I saw a video, where a traveller couple randomly met an old Hungarian man in a small village in Laos
Hungarians truly are everywhere
In blade runner a guy just goes "lófaszt" meaning horsedick
seeing hungarian anywhere outside of hungary is strange as hell
Mindenhol ottvannak de komolyan
Because of our prime minister's propaganda campaign most people abroad think that we are racists
It's not true at all, even the majority of his supporters aren't racists
"Up to 50% more just have the Soviet mentality of "we don't matter so why protest", "we don't care as long as we've got some food to eat", "it could've been worse" and "well, Putin might suck, but I get my news from TV and TV doesn't show any alternative, so I guess it doesn't exist"."
They are the true support and backbone of the system
Not the Putin-likers
I never associated bullfighting with Portugal
That's a Spanish thing in my mind
It's entirely true
It's not even taboo to be casually racist towards them if you're not a public figure
Don't worry, it's a good question
He doesn't really come off as racist in Hungary, according to his propaganda he's more like a protector of our culture and values
While I don't support him for many reasons I don't think he's actually a racist, more like an opportunist who sees that people can be manipulated by fear, especially those who live in rural areas as they haven't really encountered many foreigners
It's not a coincidence that he gets the fewest votes from the capital city
While I absolutely don't support him or his party I think this racism of his is a bit overplayed abroad
It's a bit more complicated than 50% of our country being racist
While his rhetorics do tend to attract racist voters, his propaganda campaign was very careful never to mention race or skin color, only culture and values
But his fear mongering wasn't the only reason why he got elected
There were many reasons why they won,  one of the main ones was probably the lack of a competent opposition
Before the election the opposition parties decided to work together to defeat Fidesz but their plan fell apart because they just couldn't work together
It was really painful to watch how childish they all acted while Fidesz was confident and looked competent
They also hold most of the popular media platforms in their hands so they can very easily manipulate the information that get to people online and offline
Also, I think the general population is not mature enough politically
This democracy thing is very new to our country, it's only been 30 years
Most people are used to a ruler, not a prime minister and Orbán gladly fills this role
I don't judge from the outside, the situation is same here: Hungary became a satellite state of Putin's Russia
We are Russia's brick inside the European Union
The similar mentality is dominant in Hungary - 1,5-2 millions of people love Orbán (still too much), but the "indifferent" (=cowardly) majority ensures that he will reign in Hungary until his death
In the communism, there were 200 thousand Soviet soldiers stationed in Hungary in order to keep us in the Warsaw Pact and the Eastern Bloc
Now, there is no outside force - Hungary becomes a dictatorship because of its own will - and sorry, I don't have anything against Russian people and I admire Russia's culture etc
- but today's Russia with Putin has a major role in this with the industrial manipulation, fake news factories
This is absolutely true
I know a lot of people who voted for him because other parties wanted to introduce stricter taxes
They also give lots of subsidies and help to young families
While some of them created more problems that they solved, people are afraid that others will revoke these policies
It's easy to judge but there are lots of families here that live off of 500-600 euros per month or even less, they can't afford to lose these benefits
You mean the American Budweiser or real Budvar
I am
Not really paying attention, it goes more like as a background music, but it is a tradition to watch
> relaxed, while having breakfast
That's right
New Year's Frankfurter Würstl wouldn't be the same without it
When founded the Kingdom of Hungary was one of the most diverse country in Europe, it had many nationalities (Slovaks, Serbs, Romanians, Kuns, Besenyős,Hungarians) that lived together in harmony and coexistence was encouraged by the King
Our first King wrote in his teachings to his son: "For a country with one language and costumes is weak and frail"
This diversity helped a lot to catch up in technology to the Holy Roman Empire and later helped in the Hungarian renaissance (which was also the first one outside Italy)
We have a saying: "Hungary is bordered by itself". It originates from land being annexed by neighboring countries from all sides following the treaty of Trianon at the end of WW1, leaving Hungary the size of today
I just hate these types of currency conversions
If you go back far enough in history, you could say that this piece of wood was worth $10000000 in today's money
Like, please no
Prices fluctuated through history, and you just can't calculate the price difference caused by shortage and a lot of other factors
Also, medieval England had no market economy, you just can't compare prices within the two
It's apples and oranges imho
Then the victors of WW1 said screw that and merged 2/3rd of Hungary to the neighboring countries so we can have the rest all for ourselves
What you say is true, but that only started to happen later (mostly after the Arpad dynasty died out) and was caused by religious tensions
Also I would and that the Transylvanian Principality was one of the most tolerant country during the age of reformation even fighting against a Habsburgs on more then one occasion in religious conflicts
I think the conflicts in Transylvania only started when nationalism become a thing in both nations (so mostly in the 1830s) before that it was generally a serf-Lord conflict with Hungarian and Vlach serfs fighting against Hungarian and German nobels
Paprika in most foods
The lack of turó(cottage cheese) was/is a huge surprise for me when going abroad
Apfelschorle has became quite common in Hungary in the recent years
If you ask "almafröccs" (derived from the Austrian name variant Apfel g'spritzt), chances are very high the waiter/bartender will understand
In bars and restaurants, you will most likely get mixed on the spot from Cappy apple juice and mineral water, but you can buy it in Aldi already mixed together
I love that
Also, "normal" Spritzer (made from wine and sparkling water) have been extremely common and traditional in Hungary for more than a century
Even every mix ratio has an own name
I drink that all time when I go out
Women and women, men and women who know each other pretty well, greet themselves often this way
Interestingly, mostly pretty trashy men greet themselves this way (who tend be homophobic otherwise), but it's rather unusual
"Quark" is a staple of Hungarian cuisine
Literally one of the most common ingredients
Also savory, also sweet
Kifli is very common in Hungary too
And you call it kifli
That's the Hungarian word for it so I'm a bit surprised
We have it too(kifli), and I'm pretty sure, that many other neighbouring countries also have it
Even though u/Fehervari has already written it, I'd like to emphasize how common "rohlík" in Hungary is
Very
We just don't necessarily fill it with párek and sell it for 12 Kč.
Isn't that Mezzo Mix
It's disgusting
I have no idea why galette is not popular in other regions and countries too
It's so tasty and so convenient
In Hungary, it depends on the weather and the homeowner's attitude, if you keep your shoes on while visiting somebody's house
If the weather is dry (no mud etc), it's still polite to ask "Should I put my shoes off
" And then you'll get an honest answer like "Yes please" or "No, keep them on".
In winter you don't ask
It's not English :)
>"pula" means shortage
Yep, that will leave a mark
We consider it as a separate dairy product category
Like milk, cheese, cream etc
and _túró_ (quark)
What is the premium version of mixing 1 dl Fanta and 1 dl Coke together
It's not really a "dessert" you'd eat after a meal, but I'll still go with [chimney cakes]
While it technically originates from the Roman Empire, my favourite hungarian dessert is the [Palacsinta] I think some other european countries also have it, but it's the most popular here
lol
you can get them at Spar (grocery store) bakery here
Not sure if they are the same, but they look exactly alike
Fun fact: a descendant of Franz Sacher is Gábor Zacher
He is a semi-celebrity in Hungary, because he is a toxicologist (used to be chief physician of the emergency room of a main hospital, now he's an ambulance doctor), and he often speaks in the media in various health topics (especially drugs and dependancy)
He has a distinct style, he's well trusted and liked in Hungary
Some call him "the Hungarian Walter White". Here's his photo if you wonder why:
I think the main one is that Iranians are Arabic
Some people think even Turks are Arabs
Yep, or Turks or Mongolians
The problem is that you don't understand what you are talking about and you are very proud of it
Sultan is close to the title of emperor, but it bears no religious authority (that's the caliph) but has direct ownership of everything whithin its domain
A king is the crowned ruler of a land that constitutes a kingdom and has religious authority
The Wallachian viovode(duke) was a ruler of the blood, elected by the boyars of his land, himself a (for a time) despotic ruler with no religious authority (afaik), and thes later became vassals of the sultan
Quite common and preferred method of heating outside of dense residential areas in Hungary
It was certainly more tolerant than, say, contemporary France, evidenced by the ethnic/religious minorities *not* assimilating en masse
Tokyo
Kyoto
Nagoya
Nagasaki
Sapporo
Fukushima
Nagasaki
Hiroshima
And if it counts, a city in South Sakhalin was called Toyohara in Japanese
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Yokohama, Suzuka, Fukushima and that's about it
For Hungary, it has to be [Korbuly Péter] he's insanely talented, pronounciation on point and his voice is amazing too
Most people know him from reading the staff that made the Hungarian dub of various movies and series
According to the measured popularity index: László Toroczkai
He is a far right, nationalistic politician
He was a prominent of the party _Jobbik_ ("The Right One") which used to be similar to the German AfD etc, so a newly founded party in the 2000s who represented the xenophobic, Romani-hating, anti LGBTQ etc share of the population
They became increasingly popular, in 2014 they were the greatest (not in quality) party in the opposition; they were thought authentic, since they had never been in the government and didn't have politicians from the socialastic era
Then, Jobbik shifted towards the centre, since Fidesz itself became the most chauvinistic, fascist party; some of the "old guard" left Jobbik and founded the new party _Mi Hazánk_ ("Our Homeland")
The only problem is that Mi Hazánk is actually operated by Fidesz, they clearly finance and control it (it was also the case in the earliest days of Jobbik one decade earlier, but they soon got more independent); Mi Hazánk claims to be in the opposition, but they support the worst, most controversial decisions of Fidesz blindly
So their prominent politicians can't really be called authentic and don't really have a fanbase: really patriotic people know that they are just puppets of Fidesz; only some lunatics still like them (of course, the backbone of the original fanbase of Jobbik was also consisted of idiots)
Why was he elected then
Is this his first term
A city mayor is elected directly, so people just have to vote for another candidate if they hate him so much
If the question is who gets the most hate it is Gyurcsány Ferenc and Orbán Viktor
They are the ex and the current prime ministers from opposite parties
They are both hated by the other side and blamed for a lot of things
They are both corrupt oligarchs and liars so they deserve it
I mean when we look at how many people like/dislike certain politicans on their own, I don't doubt that Toroczkai is going to be in the top3, but overall I think it has to be Orbán (if you're voting for the opposition) or Gyurcsány (if you're voting for Orbán, but he also gets hate from some opposition voters too, so
Okay, but Orbán is extremely popular
We who hate him are hating him with an extreme passion, but we're only a tiny fraction of the population
You say Bandić is the most hated
Something's not right
Well, my message to the indifferent is: behold the fate of Hungary
They are also the backbone of Orbán's support
I blame them more than the actual, blind fans
The fans don't know any better
But the apathetic could change the situation
Even if they are disillusioned with democracy, they will learn the hard way, that it's still better than a (semi-)dictatorship like in Hungary
A gay symbol
2020 just had to do it to you
Many felt it in Hungary as well, but the moving christmas decorations are nothing compared to what you have to go through right now
It was a gradual process, from the 1953 East German Monday protests to Poznan to the Hungarian Revolution, the Prague Spring, Gdansk, the Pan-European Picnic, Berlin Wall etc
Also the non-interventionist attitude of Gorbachev
János Kádár. Became the soviet puppet leader of Hungary after the revolution of 1956 was squashed by the Soviet Union
He was personally purged and tortured by the communist regime before, nevertheless he gladly reinstated the old authoctratic system when he got to be at the helm
Although after the act of amnesty he created the most liveable socialist state ever, so it's debatable
Szapolyai János/ John Zápolya
His personal ambitions and greed directly led to the tripartition of early-modern Hungary
The consequence of his actions were 200 years of constant warfare on Hungarian soil
Back in october we had mayor elections across the country
A week or two before the elections there was a video leaked of the mayor of Győr (one of our bigger cities)
He is a member of our ruling party, Fidesz, and was re-running for the position
He was an accomplished olimpic champion gymnast and has been in charge of the city since 2010
In the video he is shown balls-deep in some girl (he has a wife and kids btw) on a yacht with plenty of alcohol
Despite all of this, he STILL managed to win the elections and take the office once again
A month after winning he resigned
Further info: the "some girl" in question was a luxury prostitute who was hired at least partially with taxpayer money, along with five others, for basically a sex party of the mayor and some of his friends/associates
Cocaine was also consumed
Could have been worse
At least he is not a completely incompetent
Unlike the major of my hometown of 60
000
Who is now a minister of ...., and still micromanadges the city
Fighting away all competent businessmen who dont proverbially lick his arse hard enough - pushing away the best ones - meanwhile the other big city in my county managed to lobby out test road for self driving cars and 4G mobile services
Of course before him we had a major of what is today opposition who vetoed everything until he got an Audi A8 as his service vehicle
What about the crime scene investigators taking finger prints from wall stickers
He should have just refused to comment
Why bother, he won't become the king anyway
We also have strange pririties regarding football stadiums & hospitals
....however the highway toll collectors union being preferred over teachers (not automatizing toll collection) is nothing to scoff at
Good to see that the ex-eastern block still holds together
Even further info:
two of the girls were twins, and they later opened their wedding dress 'shop' in my city
with EU fundings
So your tax money, doesnt matter if you are Hungarian, German or Portugese
Thanks guys
Here you go
But be warned it isnt very pleasant
Mostly people not knowing some words
Either because they are only present in my dialect or because their dialect uses another word from the standard language
Some recipes that are made very differently but are called the same thing, like calling [filed cabbages with meatballs] [stuffed cabbages]
gyros in crescent
What are those words that people don’t know
Which part of the country are you from
I’m curious
Gyros with corn and cheese in Debrecen
Clearly you've never had gyros in lángos
As a Hungarian, I don't know what are you talking about
There is a standard dialect that is used in books, publications, news, tv, etc
Maybe the dialect of the capital city is closest to standard, but even there people don't follow it 100%.
The dialects don't really differ that much, only in pronunciations/accent, a few words and some grammatical structures
Probably the most different is the Székely and Csángó dialects
Since they were cut off from the rest of Hungarian speakers for a long time a lot of older words and expressions remained in their dialect, and they also adopted some words from Romanian
When speaking with people from different regions people try to use standard words instead of localized ones
The accent is harder to get rid of but poses no problem generally
How about it in Turkey
I would guess there are pretty big differences in dialects there
I'm from the east, near the border with Romania but currently I live in Budapest, the capital
Lots of regional words are adopted from other languages like Slovak, Serb, Romanian, German
However, sometimes regional words have older Hungarian roots, while the standard word is adopted
Like the standard word for corn is called kukorica, which comes from Serbo-Croatian, but where I came from we call it tengeri, which is a shortening of tengeri búza, meaning "wheat/grain from the sea".
Other times the same meaning had two words but only one is used now, but some regions kept the older one also
In my opinion most probably the two words had slightly different meanings but they merged into one and one of them stopped being used
For example aludni and hálni both mean to sleep
But hálni is not used anymore, only in compound words
Some words that are used where I'm from but not generally all around the country: vinete for padlizsán (eggplant), ler for sütő (oven), paszuly for bab (bean), ruca for kacsa (duck), oszt for aztán (then), górni for dobni (to throw), krumpli for burgonya (potatoes), köszméte for egres (gooseberry)
Most of the differences come from accent/pronunciation: jau for jó (good), pinz for pénz (money), pad for padlás (attic), vóut for volt (was), szauda/szolda for szóda (soda), otthol for otthon (at home)
with rice
Gyros with French salad
In the old Kőbánya-Kispest metro station
Igen, őszintén nem tudom mi rá a jó angol szó, eddig sosem jutott eszembe
A colleague of me is also from east, but the Ukranian border
My favorites from his words are:
- just "mag" for sunflower seeds
- "gömb" (sphere) as ice cream "gombóc"
I have a friend who eats it with pasta
Oh yes, we use those too
I will never get used to gombóc lol
It's cool how much of a cultural exchange zone Transylvania is
Ja, jó. Ha az ételt nem értenéd, akkor nézz szét Nyíregyházán (jó tudom Izlandról nincs olyan közel)
I don't like football
I rarely ever drink
I'm not complaining about my problems as often
Even though I'm not as open minded as the average westerner, but I'm still noticeably more open than the national average
Hungarian folk music makes me fucking cringe
I enjoy Romanian national songs e.g: Drum bun, Traiasca Romania, the anthem etc
I find the history of other countries more interesting than ours (but that might be because having learnt it in school I take it for granted)
I think pálinka is an inherently mediocre spirit and it's most perfect iterations are only okay at best
But hey, at least it's not borovička, which is something
I hope you still eat mici on May 1st
Hello there fellow outcast :)
If you think it's vodka you are going to have a bad time when you first drink it
It's a fruit brandy
'Being a Scot' means the person is a cheapskate
"Ez nekem kínai
" = "This is Chinese to me"
Meaning: I don't understand this at all
"Ég mint a reichstag" "he is (his face) burning like the Reichstag" when someone is feeling so embaressed that his face starts turning red
We have the tatars saying in Hungary too
We have the Scottish one in Hungary as well
Yeah I thought bratanki was brothers
Yeah, we sometimes say "I´m going to watch Swedish girls in Tirol now
Sadly, being racist isn't generally stigmatized, especially against gypsies
...wait until you see leader of the communist east tongue kissing for a greeting
I tend to say that tax evasion is the hungarian national sport
Since 1848 - as after the revolution got beaten, people didn't really want to contribute for the cause of our austrian overlords, and the attitude stuck
I would say that is not unusual here either - its not 70% but not uncommon either
We usually wear swimsuits or a towel
Some places even kick you out if you are going in nude
Not really a documentary, but
The Üvegtigis films (Glass tiger) are really good at showing the Hungarian reality
Hungarian mentality, humor, places, everything
It has no epic cinematography, or even a green screen, only some guys drinking and talking and laughing
But that's all that matters
Here's the first movie;
Yeah, not really a documentary
Just a bunch of funny drunk guys in a village trying to run a roadside buffet
I can't think of a documentary right now but Hungary's history goes back over a 1000 proud years
The movie Magyar Vandor does a decent job at history:
On easter men dress up nicely and visit every female relative and friend, and "sprinkle" them with rose water or perfume
As a reward women give us easter eggs, and young boys get money from relatives
Traditionally men used to splash women with a bucket of water
&#x200B;
Edit: also, Santa comes on Saint Nicholas day (December 6), not on Christmas
Santa usually gives minor presents like sweets, oranges, a small toy, while on Christmas it's Jesus that brings the presents
We keep a 1000 year old severed hand in a church in the capital
Once a year it's being carried around in a fancy march
It's going to happen in 5days
Hungary here
We clap for EVERY performance in a theater, no matter what quality it was
Clapping is not the reward for a good performance or piece of theatrics, it's a MUST
And the actors HAVE to be recalled by sustained applause exactly three times, not more, not less
Also, old people still clap when a plane lands
We hungarians do this too
But we only drench friends, family and schoolmates
And nowadays we only use perfume or sparkling water
We use buckets less
In Hungary if you are a good child you get presents from Santa on Saint Nicholas day
If you are bad you get a piece of coal from the Krampusz or he takes you away
When I was a kid our school always had a Santa and a Krampusz come to our class, Santa always chased the Krampusz away and gave us some sweets
There was a publicity stunt of a commercial channel that they declared already in autumn that they were _not_ going to air Home Alone that year
Of course it caused a huge uproar (as they planned), then they issued the slogan "No christmas without Kevin
" and did air it as usual
I can't decide if this sketch is sadder or creepier
Thanks, I corrected it
Yep, [I think it's the same thing]
This looks like the Kartoffelkönig
I imagine this like a good excuse to have a dinner with your neighbours
Which famous historical figure from your country was actually a bad person
For Hungary it would most likely be the Horthy government and exspecially Kuno Klebersberg, he is famous for the school reform (what is also controversial since the actually important reform was already done) but he was very heavily antisemitic
Franz Ferdinand
Everyone keeps talking about how he wanted to reform Austria-Hungary into the United States of Greater Austria, and bring equality to all the people of the monarchy, while in reality, he dropped such ideas quite early (around 1903, I think)
In the first place, as a true neo-absolutist, his only goal was to increase his power and have himself be called Emperor in all of his empire
He was vehemently anti-Hungarian and hated the Slavs only a little bit less ( I don't know how he sorted that out given his wife was Czech) . Although advocated for good relations with Russia, he did so only in reactionary spite to prevent the lower classes from taking power
His grim, uncompromising personality and disgusting hunting habits didn't make him anymore sympathetic either
If his death wouldn't have sparked the Great War, it would've been one of the luckiest incidents of the Danubian Monarchy
But still pretty efficient
This was underhanded
I think it is pretty known he was a baaad guy
But at least you guys have some cool architecture from his time
I think most rulers converted to protestantism for the land
Really
We only learn about him that how he supported the estern-European democracies
Jelacic ban (sorry for misspelling) is pretty known to Hungary
We learn that the Hungarian government offered Croatia autonomy and independence (but only after the war is won)
And that he refused and sided the the Emperor Anti-croatian sentiment is somewhat true, there were elements in the Hungarian parlament that wanted to keep Hungarian as the only language of the Kingdom of Hungary
But the general opinion was for a diverse kingdom like in the middle ages
But Bismarck still made a lot of social reforms, right
He may hate the idea of a socialist country but he wasn't realised that reforms were needed
He wasn't the brightest either
Rip 3rd Army
But still he made a miracle by defeating the red army, whitout him Easter Europe would have been overrun
More in a "respected" sense of meaning
How can enyone see that communist dictator as hero
To be honest the Ottomans might have just done something similar to Wallachia if the opportunity presented itself
I shall lock you in the seven towers, and make you sit on the flaming throne
lust I guess
This torture fantasy of yours got out of hand
Even in Hungary he was seen as just the worst, my family still takes about how our relatives in Romania was amazed how much food and stuff we had under the communist regime
There are some Hungarians too who are nostalgic to communism but for us communism was way softer
Hungary declaring war on the US in 1941
Not like the rest of WW2 decisions weren’t awful, but this one is actually funny
There is an anecdote about the situation (of course it didn’t happen, but very telling):
So the aid goes to Roosevelt and declares war
He asks if Hungary is a Kingdom or a republic
Aid responds it’s a kingdom
FDR: What’s the King’s name
Aide: Hungary doesn’t have a King
FDR: Then who runs the kingdom
Aide: A Regent by the name of Admiral Miklós Horthy
FDR: Admiral
Then Hungary must have a powerful navy
Aide: Hungary has no navy; it doesn’t even have access to the sea
FDR: Wars are often fought for religious reasons
What’s the main religion there
Aide: Catholicism, Mr
President
But Admiral Horthy is Protestant
FDR: Did this admiral declare war on us because of territorial claims then
Aide: Hungary’s territorial claims are against Romania
FDR: In that case, did Hungary declare war on Romania
Aide: No, Hungary and Romania are allies
FDR: Let me get this straight
Hungary is a  kingdom run by a Regent who’s an admiral without a navy, and it is  allied with Romania against which it has territorial claims but it has  declared war on the U.S. against which it doesn’t.
Aide: That’s right, Mr
President
Being too soft on the powerholders of the previous regime during the fall of communism
"yay we defeated a multi ethnic empire which was crumbling because of said ethnicities, let's make another one with same ethnicities
Unfortunately the reason isn’t that funny
It was on 12 December, a few days after Pearl Harbour
Hungary joined the Axis before, It was a formality to show loyalty towards Germany so Hungary won’t be invaded, but since Germany and Italy declared war too the ministry (behind Horthy’s back, and with some resistance from other members) decided we had to do it also
But Hungary also had armistice negotiations with the US, (and later with the Soviets) which actually resulted in occupation by Germany so let’s just say things were a ‘little’ chaotic back then
2 multy ethnic empires that didn't really care about minorities and only cared about themselves
How is comparing the two dumb
It’s a very complex subject, to be honest
It’s understandable that they went with the path of least resistance, but Hitler was the strong man at least part of the country actually believed in, and when deportations started, they took a very active role, let’s just say the antisemite propaganda found a ground where it’s fruit could grow into something very poisonous (and the aftermath can still be felt to this day)
Horthy did try to minimize the damage but the anti-jew laws were still accepted, and a lot of people in the government weren’t just submissing to fascism, but they were actively supporting it
I’m saying this because to this day there is the agenda that we were victims of the whole thing and dont want to take responsibility, which is harmful because if we dont face the dynamics that lead to past mistakes, we are going to keep repeating them
On the other hand, just purely based on geography/political power I agree that the only way not having the country burned to the ground was not going against the Axis
I'm sure Slovenians, Croatians, Bosnians, Montenegrins would like to have a talk with you then
Especially since Belgrade was abusing its power and actually committed genocide
If you are asking who did yugoslavia commit genocide on as a serb (judging from your user flair) then there are problems
But fair enough, didn't know much about the Montenegrin part, was just assuming they were full of it as well
Apologies then, wasn't taught about yugoslav wars as they were rather recent at the time and never really read up on it just vaguely
I was talking about Sebrenica massacre
Second link is broken for me (403), here's a working one:
I'd say Sopron
Its proximity to Austria makes it very attractive for people because they can get a job on the other side of the border (even in Vienna) while having a lower cost of living
Also lots of Austrian cash flowing in because they can get services cheaper here, dentists for example are making bank in Sopron
One of the few cities with a positive population growth
If not Sopron then Budapest
The capital's hard to beat, being nearly 9 times bigger than our 2nd largest city in a heavily centralized country and such
I would say the whole Győr-Moson-Sopron county is benefiting from the internal population migration and the proximity of highly developed regions (besides Vienna there is also the Bratislava-region)
Sopron, Győr and smaller towns like Mosonmagyaróvár also had grown in the past years
Sopron is insane, officially it is a town of 60000, but there are estimations that the real number can be around 100000
And as Budapest grows, its surrounding area does the same, tows like Érd, Szigetszentmiklós, Dunakeszi, Budaörs and Szentendre all had 7-15% population growth between 2011 and 2020, I don't know much about their infrastructure though
What is something that you feel like is almost everywhere, but not in your country
A properly functioning middle class & classes above
Damn, I'm so happy this blew up
Right there with you neighbour
We have this too - it is so sad :(
Just curious, do you guys also have Schitzel or is it only an Austro-Hungarian thing
It's not a competition (:
Which is Vladimir in incognito, isn't it
Bares für Rares is a good show
I actually don't know much about other German foods, I only visited once briefly
Schitzel is a very good, we eat it at least once a week here
Well, I can't actually say that you're not in a harder situation than a lot of others/us because, well, it's Macedonia, no offense
But still there are things that are missed in other countries because everyone lacks more or less things, so you know what I'm trying to say haha
Typo, I was tired and my spelling is "unique"
Either is fine, just like with the number seven
But I'm pretty sure 99% of the time I see both (z and 7) without the line
Huh, TIL that there's no z in Swedish
I don't know the statistics, but every 4th person I know has a second name, so I would say it's not common, but not rare
Their ecological footprint
And those meter high fences you can just hop over
>Which leads to the next unusual thing about America, the need of a business seems to rank higher than the need of a human
When Americans, especially those on the political right, talk about human rights, the priority seems to be *the right to make money however you want*. It seems more sacred than anything else, maybe with the exception of guns
I know the point is that the rate decreased significantly but "only about 50%" is still hilariously weird to me
Like, ONLY
More like HOLY SHIT HALF THE POPULATION
Peanut butter and jelly, deep fried
I can feel the heart attack
Especially as it still doesn't specify which Frankfurt
Although I assume it's Frankfurt am Main
Thing is, approaching this from a legal standpoint is useless
Children don't know their rights as such, they are not aware of court rulings - if they are pressured by teachers or their peers, which is bound to happen, they have zero real choice
>A lot of stores don’t even accept personal checks anymore
The fact that they used to accept them in the past is weird enough to me
A book I read referred to that as 'Eastern European way' - the point is not to burn others accidentally with the cigarette
>She drove her car across the street everyday
Literally across the street
As in, the office was on one side of the street, while her apartment was on the other side
Because then surely simply getting in the car, parking it, and then getting out would take longer than walking
And it's not just about the dirt, really - it's such a nice feeling, after a long day, to finally take your shoes off and let your feet breathe
It's one of life's great pleasures
Walking into a store and immediately being pounced on with a big "HI HOW ARE YOU HOW CAN I HELP YOU" is the very opposite of a pleasant experience
My ideal shopping experience would be being left well alone until I need something - be available at that point, that's all I ask
Yeah, that's still insane to me
The delightful thing is that you can combine the two
(And I don't mean that you should take a shit in your shoes)
Oh so they want me to actively hate the place
That makes a certain amount of twisted sense, I suppose
Thank fuck most store owners around here haven't heard of that research
Or are content to just have their employees say a simple, unintrusive "hi".
> It may cut down on shoplifting, but it also chases away legitimate customers like us
Which is exactly why I'm not convinced it's a good idea, even if it does cut down on shoplifting
It's just hard to measure "number of customers who got out because they were annoyed by the sales staff".
I like the _Palace of Arts_ very much
It was completed in 2005
It has a large and very good and modern concert hall, a smaller theatre stage, and it houses the museum of modern arts
As Miskolc only became a regional center after the first world war, and as it was considered as a "new city" after the second world war, it has plenty of modern/brutalist buildings
I just linked a few, choose what you like
[The city hall,] the [Macropolis office-apartment block] [this building in the county hospital] cave bath,] [Avas TV/Look-Out Tower]
The whole university campus, for example [the main building] [the newest reconstruction (W.I.P. picture, but I didn't find a completed one)] or [the sport arena]
[Szinvapark mall] [Peczel Mór street] [the Jesuit high school and church,] [the reformed church of Miskolctapolca]
There are much more than this, sadly lot of them are in bad shape because the economical regression after 1989 and the general ignorance and hatred against the buildings of this era, like the [Juno Hotel] or the "[Hűtőház] (cold store)
This looks like a giant cubist fish
Entirely rebuilding an old building that no longer exists (even according to the original plans) is a good example of kitsch, and obviously not of good taste
You can see the concert hall itself inside and above the main block on the first picture
It's pretty much an independent structure (it's flexibly connected to the other parts, so the vibration and noise from the railways and road traffic isn't transferred to it)
Why not both
They look like the standard Vienna subway stations, except the colour of the line is more attractive (than the red of U1 or green of U4 etc)
But I don't understand the platform gates: you can have fully automated, driverless subways without those ugly structures: the Budapest metro line M4 is of this kind (the trains don't even have a driver's cab, you can watch the track in the front), but not this nonsense: there are photocell sensors in case anybody falls onto the track, and the trains are stopped
This line is in operation for almost 7 years, and AFAIK there were like 2 accidents, actually less than the usual number of suicides on the other, manned lines
I've never been to Warsaw, so I haven't seen it with my eyes
And I understand why it was important to you guys emotionally to rebuild the old town
And I don't want to hurt your feelings
But for me, it isn't an old town, those are new buildings which resemble the old ones
The old town of Warsaw is totally gone, even if there is a lookalike there
For me
I prefer the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin: it was the one of the most beautiful (or at least most important) squares in the city
It was destroyed, it was a no-man's-land for decades because the Wall went through it
And after the Wende, they didn't decide to rebuild the old buildings, they began to build modern skyscrapers and other stuff
The Potsdamer Platz is important again, but not as a set for some history picture
EDIT: and one more thing
They demolished the Palast der Republik which was a very imposant building of the GDR and stood more or less there where this building was built
They said it contained asbestos, but I bet the new Bundesrepublik wanted to destroy the memory of the GDR anyway
It isn't a fond memory, but it's part of Germany's history, just like the Third Reich
This is why I resent this rebuilt palace
I regularly go to Berlin, although I don't live there, and Potsdamer Platz is one of my favorite places there
So, 1:1 :)
Btw, I usually sleep at the Anhalter Bahnhof in the vicinity - I also like that they left that stump of the building there as a monument (even when the station wasn't destroyed in the war, but afterwards)
I disagree that the Palast der Republik was hideous
Of course Warsaw would be bland without the rebuilt old town
Of course
That's the whole point
The old town was destroyed by a barbarian monstrosity, and now it is gone
Forever
A bland city is the monument of the terrible war
You can build a theatre set to imitate the historic look, or you can build something new which can also be pretty and interesting and harmonic
They didn't even try the latter one
This is why I started with this: "And I understand why it was important to you guys emotionally to rebuild the old town
And I don't want to hurt your feelings
Fair enough
Would you support a really high level of European integration move
If yes, how far would you go with the integration
This
I fully agree with this
The "de-nationalizeing" of the parliament should be the first step
To represent national interests there's the European council
With a deeper integration, and the regional welfare equalising, there would be an amazingly tremendous pressure on richer countries (like Sweden) because of poorer countries (like Hungary) so in short term Swedes would probably have worst welfare then they have now
I also support it as much as possible, but for me I feel like it's more selfish
I respect your opinion
I don't think political integration have to mean cultural integration too
I think Europe is amazing because of all her different cultures, not despite them
Do you think that Polish, Italian and Hungarian people are more easily manipulated by populist politicians and their vote would be "mined" in a European general election
Or do you think that the established national governments would destort the newly forming EU government
I guess she would be the youngest of 3 peasant sisters who runs away from home to become a [betyár]
She would definitely have a [puli] or a [vizsla] as an animal sidekick
She would preferably be illustrated with Disney's iconic art style mixed with either the [folk tales] or the [King Matthias] styles
She would be very smart and witty
The story would contain typical Hungarian folk tale tropes, like she would outsmart the dragon with seven heads, whom no knight could defeat in battle
With this she would get half the kingdom as a reward, so she would become a real "princess" by the end
In Hungarian, her name is Harisnyás Pippilotta Citadella Intarzia Majolika Ingaóra :)
Can the Austro-Hungarian empire claim her
yeah, she lived in Hungary iirc
There's always room for more simps
it's a famous palace here
We do, if I remember correctly it had about half a page in the books so not much but we learn about it certainly
It takes up a bit less then 2 months of classes, 1 week (2-5 classes depending on school) on western front, 2 week eastern front, 3 weeks about Hungarian involvement and 1 week about the atrocities of the war (Holocaust, Rape of Nanjing, Katjin and so on)
The Hungarian education system generally has a "universal history" and a "Hungarian history" part where each era is first thought in general world history (which means European and a bit of Japan and US) and then Hungarian
They do it so kids may have a better understand of global political changes that affected Hungary
And how is it in Russia
I remember someone told be that you call the the Great Patriotic War (maybe not exactly that I have heard this a few years back)
Very interesting thanks
We try to be objective too but nowadays some books try to shift the blame for the Holocaust from the Hungarians to the occupying Germans (which is obviously isn't true)
Speaking about that generation is even more touchy here since there are still people who celebrate the defenders of Budapest as heroes (while their were lead by SS officers) and others who celebrate the Liberating troops (who also committed a lot of atrocities)
So we don't talk much about the Second World War in politics beside the Holocaust since whatever you say someone will be upset
That Immortal Regiment thing is very interesting, I have never heard of it
I see, I have only heard this translation from some girls from inner Russia
Thanks for clearing this up
I see
Just out of curiosity, how is it called in Ukrainian
And how is the Second World War generally taught in schools
Interesting, then similar to ours then the difference is that the Hungarian narrative also shifted to the opposite side lately
Hungarian narrative used to be very anti-russian, but nowdays it seems to shift
Many textbooks are trying to kind of make a revision on history because of political preasure
Everyone who reads r/europe knows that it is the [house of parliament] in Hungary

As I'm reading stuff here, only one thing came to my mind:
What the f.ck, what's wrong with the world
A teen delivered a strong six minute speech criticising the government at a protest in the town of Kecskemét. For some reason this appeared in newspapers from all over the political spectrum, some praising her, some criticising her
The thing escalated for months with newspapers digging very deep into her personal life too, one lied about her grades in school, saying she was failing many subjects because of protesting
She ended up speaking at other political events, was discussed in talkshows and appeared on TV
I have no idea why, since angry speeches at protests occur all the time and I don't know what was so special about her
Put paprika on
Well pretty much everything I eat outside of sweets
Got drunk on Pálinka and invited myself to the neighbour's outdoor cooking to get some paprikás.
I always have a pork liver pate like [this] and some unseasoned crackers in my checked in bag wherever I travel, you just never know when shit hits the fan in some weird ass country
In fact I have one right now in my suitcase
My friend who does a lot of solo travel for business in rural Asia rather trusts the Pick salami but that is a poor choice IMHO, above 30C grease starts dripping from it
If it was a side dish it does not count
We start to eat schnitzel between two slices of bread as soon as the bus or the train starts to move
No I think that's a more general price sensitive central european tourist thing
We have dual citizenship
It is most frequently awarded to Hungarians in neighbouring countries, who were separated from Hungary by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920
It has caused some conflict with Slovakia, who banned dual citizenship right after we allowed it, and Ukraine, who wants to ban dual citizens from holding elected office right now
I think that dual citizenship is a good thing, as it is in dual citizens' interest that the government of the country of origin supports them in their new country, and vice versa
AFAIK, you can apply for citizenship after getting married to a Hungarian, but I think a history/language test still applies in those cases
Its also the no
1 way for election fraud
Yes, you probably would
There are two ways for a simplified process:
A. Do you speak Hungarian
Anyone who speaks Hungarian and is descended from a Hungarian citizen may apply through a simplified process, regardless of residence
B. Did your grandfather lose his citizenship due to emigration between 1945 and 1990
Did he regain his citizenship
If not (and he is still alive), he can send a request to the president of the republic (János Áder) to restore his citizenship
However, in the latter case, I'm not sure what happens if your grandfather is already deceased, and what happens to the adult child of someone who gains Hungarian citizenship (i.e. if your grandpa/mother gained Hungarian citizenship, what would that mean for you
Otherwise, I think you probably have to go through the eight-year residency process, but it's probably faster to learn Hungarian and just apply that way
My source is Wikipedia, so I don't know more than the internet on the matter
If you speak Hungarian, you can get the Hungarian citizenship without living in Hungary
>What about elections on EU level
In EU elections, if you have any EU citizenship, you are supposed to vote in the country you live in
If you live in multiple countries, you are only allowed to vote in one of them (though I don't know how they would be able to control that)
I wasn't alive at the time and the Hungarian Wikipedia page only speaks about the current data
But the TV show, Deutschland 83 shows a little bit of the epidemic in Germany, it's a side plot, so not the focus of the show, but it was interesting to see a non-American series talk about AIDS, it feels like the conversation around this topic is really heavily centered around the US and Africa (for obvious reasons), so it was refreshing to see it in a different setting, by the way it's a pretty good show, so it worth checking out
I love listening to German and Dutch, they just sound so good
German
I could listen to someone speaking german for hours probably
Dunno why but i really love it
The accent is amazing as well
Irish is really fascinating, a super unique language imo
Norwegian is cool, very pleasant on the ears
I couldn't care less in most cases
Unless people talk shit about Poland
That's a no-no for me talking about my brethren like that
I don't care about insulting any country
Thank you
I feel the same towards Poland
Its people have some of the greatest and sturdiest resolve and the country and people are beautiful
My parents didn't call me by any nicknames
But my grandma always called me csillagvirág (Starflower) or kiscsillagom (my little star) though :)
Oh and mucikám (my ducky according to the internet apparently
I don't know how common this is (or if at all), but I was and still sometimes am called:
*kutya* (=dog) or *ló* (=horse) by my father
*maci* (=teddy bear) by my mother
My sister is called *boci* (=cow calf) by our grandmother
*tücsök* - cricket (the insect)
*tündér* - fairy
*bogár* / *bogaram* - bug, my bug (the collective term for some insects)
Are my parents weird
lol
On basic levels it's fine, but later on it teaches some sentences which make no sense
And of course in hungarian you can mix up the sentences a lot, and duolingo doesn't have that
Mentally abusing your own children
I cannot even count how many times I've been called a fat pig (for being not as thin as my siblings) or a retard (for getting a B /4 in my country/)
Being yelled at is the norm here in my parent's house
And if I tell anyone, they don't really belive me
Letting the parlament elect the district attorney
Putting empty milk carton back into the fridge

Wtf, is that really a thing
I'll get out in about 3 years, since I'm in uni now
I'll never speak to them again ever from the moment I have a degree and a job
The university's psychologist can help me in the time left
But
that makes the crumbs soggy, which is disgusting af
It ruins the best thing about the schnitzel
Thank you
It's ok, I'm used to it now
My parents used to tell me if I was misbehaving the Kunka would come and get me
The seven-headed dragon and the three-headed one as well turn up in Hungarian folk tales from time to time
Most of the time it is the youngest son of the poor farmer who has the adventures though, not a prince
Wait, that's not a thing in the US
I visited to Berlin last year
I went to a very authentic Italian restaurant (by myself), and there was an elderly, American couple at the next table
You could tell they were American, since both of them wore baseball caps, bright colours like purple and green and such; probably from Florida, idk
Once, I heard the waiter telling them in English (as he took their order): "No, sorry, there's no pizza with pineapple
" So, there's that
Really, mate
Pizza comes from Italy, it's thin crust, and ideally has only tomatoes, mozarella, basil, and a little garlic oil on top
Most every pizzeria in Europe has that, and then some vairiations regarding the toppings
Now please walk into the nearest Pizza Hut, and find something on the line of "Hot dog crusted triple string cheese pizza with baloney and spam", and rethink that for a second
Oooh, you mean like those kinds of kitchen appliances
I assumed like small ones like mixers, toasters, blenders, etc
Whether the big ones remain or go depends on the seller and buyer
A lot of times people move them to their new homes as well
That card game is popular here too and Black Pete is always a chimneysweep
Edit: [here] [are] [some] [popular] [depictions]
Nouns are not gendered in Hungarian
The two definite articles, “a” and “az” are used based on whether the next letter is a consonant or a vowel
The indefinite article “egy” goes with both letters
Sounds very archaic and strange if you use “az” incorrectly (ie
before a consonant), and using “a” incorrectly simply sounds wrong
The only time someone would not know which of the two definite articles to use is if a foreign word in Hungarian text started with a letter that has a different pronunciation than it has in Hungarian
For example, the “u” sounds: Hungarian pronounces the short u sound similar to “oo” like in boots, so someone who doesn’t know that Utah is pronounced Yootah could pronounce it as Ootah
Ahaha, *La nutella* almost makes it sound like it's some prestigious gourmet dish
I only saw TV in the last few years when I walked past my parent watching it so there are probably others
We mostly have American,(British
),German(yes including Cobra 11)and Hungarian movies but Bud Spencer and Terence Hill (Italy) movies are quite popular also
But why
It has a huge meme potential, imo
Wtf
Hallmark and lifetime movies are the best for when you just want something predictable and wholesome
Wikipedia explains the slow and dumb to come from the long vowels which looks finnish speech slow
In Hungary we say that your feet are hairy
Zentrifugal/Sommersonne is a good music to convince people about the non-harshness of German
How about the wooden shoes
As a country being on the receiving end of not surrendering french armies at least twice, we also don't use this
But its a Biiig one here
This is basically the only one in Hungary
A beginning of a beautiful friendship
In cities (or maybe everywhere) it depends on the season, the buildings retain heat, or whatever - it feels warmer after the summer than before it
If it's above 10°c and sunny, I would consider it in the autumn, in the spring 15°c and above
For me, it's
* below 5°C: winter coat
* 5°C-15°C: jacket
* 15°C-22°C: pullover
* 22°C: short-sleeved T-shirt
Depends on the season
If it's autumn, 15C is tshirt weather
If it's spring, I'm still cold in 15C, so I'd say rather above 20 during spring
The governing right-wing party, the Fidesz and the radical right-wing opposition party, the Jobbik switched places on the political spectrum
Said Jobbik fell apart after the previous leader, Vona left
They are currently on low profile, and cooperate with the rest of the opposition
Few weeks ago, the governing Fidesz-KDNP parties suffered their very first significant political defeat since 2006; the opposition got into power in the Capital, Budapest
Ukraine also started cracking down on minority rights, which is supposed to strengthen Ukrainian unity, but I think it'd distasteful and will just make minorities hate the country
(Hungarians, Russians etc
can no longer study in their own language and so on)
Our problem is far from the existence of Ukraine
You deserve your freedom and sovereignty
It's just that xour country is full of minorities (Russians, Hungarians, Romani, Poles) and what your government is doing is basically breaking internetional treaties about the rights of minorities and taking away their right to education in their native language
Don't try to paint me some anti-Ukranian, because I am not one
If you are a member of the UN, you are obligated to protect the rights of minorities
Ukraine no longer does
I understand the case about Russianization, but hundreds of thousans get caught in the crossfire, and it fills be with deep regret and anger, that the lives, rights and needs of these small to quite big communities are only thought of as collateral
As if they, as citizens, didn't matter to the state
If Ukraine does not want to take care of the Poles or the Hungarians or anyone else, and grant them the rights she has to, than fine, but let them be independent then
Do not force the Ukrainian language upon them
These people and their ancestors have lived there for centuries, they shouldn't be punished for staying where their deep cultural roots are to be found, and where their fathers and mothers lived before, and are burried today
There is no way around human rights
Either they are granted or they are not
Currently the laws in state of Ukraine infringe upon these rights -- the ones, that have been essential in humanity's quest for peace since the second world war
Dugovics Titusz: During the siege of Nándorfehérvár the Turkish tried to assault the fortress, and some guy climbed up the tower to plant their flag, but Titusz hugged them and jumped off the tower with the turks
well at least we have made-up heroes lmao
just dont swap the first letters of his name
> if he even existed
he didn't, some guy made him up to get some land as proof of how "heroic" his family was
The petty noble Dugovics family who claimed to descend from him was of Croatian origin actually, but historians basically all agree that even if it really did happen it was at the Siege of Jajce in 1463, and the name and the specific person Titusz Dugovics was certainly made up by the family to look more heroic, so not like it matters
Still a hero
One of my ancestors was a hero from the era of fort warfare in the 16th century
His name was Thury György/Georg von Thury and he was the captain of Várpalota
He was a feared by the Turks as the "Lion of Transdanubia". He never lost a single duel in his life and several people came to the war-torn Hungary only to challenge him
My great great grandfather fought in the Battles of the Isonzo
My great grandfather fought on the Eastern front during WW2 and later against the Soviets during the 1956 uprising
His brothers also fought in the the Eastern Front and one was a tank commander
Another went MIA some time in 1944
My ancestors didn’t like Russians apparently
Lajos Kossuth, who was  Governor-President of Hungary during the 1848-49 Revolution was one of my ancestors and my great-greatgrandfather was Károly Dietz who the commissioner of police of Budapest after the Aster Revolution in 1918 and was imprisioned by the communists during the Hungarian Soviet Republic later he was the coach of the Hungarian football team during the 1938 football World cup where Hungary reached the final
In 1944 he was sent to the Mauthausen concentration camp but survived
After the war he was banished from Budapest by the communist regime and worked as a nightguard in Bodrogkeresztúr but he could return a couple of years later
He died a year after my mother was born in 1969
My mother told me that one of his sayings as a coach was, that a striker can not make it to the penalty area alive
We still have his diary but sadly, some parts were lost, for example his writings about the 1938 World cup
Not once
Wich makes us something of an outlier in Europe
Also under Rudolf
Oh my god I forgot about that part
Speaking at least two languages, even in Eastern Europe (where older generations had no chance to learn western languages) the young generation speaks at least two but often three languages
Diesel cars
The distances are so long, it would make sense
I'll make it legal
It is more of a curse I think, we are pretty much forced to learn a different language so we speak at least 2 languages
Also nations who have more then one nationality usually speak even more(for example most people I know from Romania speak some Hungarian)
We have both
They are pretty much the same, there are some products in Lidl and some in Aldi which are better
Maybe the service (waiting time at the cashier) is a little bit better at Aldi, but Lidl is nearer to my home
National embarrassment to Sweden
You still asked questions
Even if they aren't prompting answers, they're still questions
Lízing which is said like leasing
*Flash drive* is called *pendrive* for some reason
Thought the English version was called pendrive and we just started using the phonetic version of it but apparently we made up a new English word and went with that
A scooter is a ‘roller’
They duckin teaching us these in school
We have that too, but more like "szorri vagyok" which is "I am sorry" - the funny part is that there's no similar construction in Hungarian, we have an "active" verb for being sorry ("sajnálom"), something like "I regret", so "szorri vagyok" sounds very alien
Actually, it's not really common
Imidzs as a personal or company image
Teachers telling us ''we might do a test about this next lesson so study
'' and then we don't and an entire afternoon gone by studying for something that I will never use ever again
On the other hand if we don't study and we do write a test my mother taking my free time away when I'm turning 16 next month
And like
all of the subjects have this problem, and like
every day
-Hungary
Oh boy, where do I start
Since I'm a senior the biggest threat for me is that currently noone has any idea how the scoring works for the university application right now
There are certain rules that goes against each other
Just this year for example they introduced that you must take a higher sat to be qualified to apply
Previously one higher sat meant extra 50 points, but now it worth nothing, and they didn't reduce the required scores
So for example if you want to become a doctor which already requires two higher sats in order to reach the requirements you must take a 3rd one- one that you might've never learnt, and you must prepare for that in your senior year
The other fucked up thing is that you can get extra points for different types of language exams
Not different level, just different type
So if you have an intermediate origo and an intermediate ielts for example, even tho they worth the same (except it's extra 60k huf,~180€, 200$)
Oh, and an intermediate language exam is also a requirement, but most of the public schools are lack of English teachers right now, cause they are so poorly paid they either switch jobs, or goes abroad
And if all in all this wouldn't be so bad the universities won't hand out scholarships if you reach the required scores anymore
One term is going to cost 3M huf (~9k€, ~10k$)
Of course the average Hungarian can't afford that especially if the law school for example lasts for six years
Ohh and the books are government censored
Of course as you can see this system results in that the intellectuals who are not worshiping this system and won't get money directly from the government are most likely go abroad to do their studies
I'm lucky to attend one of the top schools and 60% of my classmates are planning to study abroad including me
So the intelrctuals who are against the current  leaders will leave the country, only those who have some kind of positive connections to them will be able to attend universities, and proper education in total, and the ones who can't... Well for them the only option remains is work that doesn't require much education like farming
Oh they also won't be able to get non government censored news from around the world cause they won't study other languages apart from Hungarian
This oddly reminds me of feudalism
And there are much more guys
Can you elaborate on this please
Isn’t getting a secondary education compulsory
Ah, we pretty much have the same system except there isn't too large of a difference between the two in terms of furthering your studies
The main difference between the Középiskola (Middle school) and Gimnázium (Gymnasium) is that the former provides you with a small degree of specialized education in their choice of discipline while the latter provides a more general education with less specialization
Choosing either is not going to prevent you from getting in to any of our universities
Having said that, middle schools tend to have a worse reputation in general, but that's more the fault of the school and how it's managed rather than it being inherently worse than the other
Ciorba, the Romanian sour soup
It definitely was a pleasant surprise for me
Escargot in France
It wasn't disgusting, it was quite good
Goulash is a Hungarian food, so if you tried it in Hungary, then you had the original version
The rest is copy only
Nevertheless, there are good copies, but they will never be real
You should definitely try it out sometime
Copy or not the Czechs have beer-goulash which is quite a good twist to our traditional red wine usage
Also most peeps in other countries mean pörkölt when they are talking about goulash don't forget
Not really, but it can't go without paprika, that's true
I don't think that 30-40g to a kg of beef is wayyy too much, but of course it depends on your personal taste
The [Árpád flag] is a bit controversial but the most disliked ones come from the communist era and from WW2
Here is the [flag] which was used in communist Hungary before the 1956 uprising
And here is the [flag] which was used by the nyilas/hungarista movement (Hungarian national socialists) during WW2 (the red and white stripes are the same as on the Árpád flag and that's where the controversy for the Árpád flag comes from)
Edit: grammar
There isn't much, maybe the [flag with the Rákosi Coat of arms] is kind of a no go, because of the brutality the Rákosi government used to reach and surpass a Stalin-like dictatorship
The Árpád flag is controversial because of the same reason why old Viking era Scandinavian symbols are controversial
It has been appropriated by the far right and people associate the flag with them now
I wish the Árpád flag didnt have controversial symbolism
I looks pretty cool
some tap heads were the perfect diameter, we put a .5l bottle on the end of such tap and turned it on, then waited for the boom
not really games but we sniffed bolero (soda powder) and huffed technocol rapid (instant glue) in school
"operation" It was when a poor kid got thrown onto a school desk, four held his hands and feet, and the "doctor" pulled up his shirt, and repeatedly slapped his belly with his palms hard
Today that would be a case of serious harassment
Oh, and "grand journey".
One school seat put up to the wall (to counter recoil), one kid -who has the strongest legs- sits on it
Another seat comes in front of him, a smaller kid sits on it
The trick is for the strong kid to kick the other seat along with the kid as far as possible by suddenly straightening his legs: the other kid slides a few meters, before he inevitably tips over, and falls on the face
The most important part is the choir however
The name of the game comes from a melancholy song, "Nagy utazás", by the fucking legend Presser Gábor
There needs to be a choir of kids who sing the song with feeling, while one is sent flying with a chair
Then they switch, and everyone gets his turn
God, we had near constant purple bruises
EDIT: obligatory link to the song
51 - you needed a goal and a football
Kids would only touch the ball once and you only played for one goal
One kid would start as a goalie (randomed)
If you scored a goal, you got points, if you hit a goalpost some other points (points often varied)
If you missed the goal or the goalie caught the ball, you would stand in as goalie
When the points hit or exceeded 51 the current goalie had to bend over and turn
The rest of the kids lined up (first kid with the least points, last with the most) like a penalty shootout and had to kick the ball hitting the guy's ass
If he missed he'd have to stand in as a goalie, bend over and turn
As time went on, more and more kids would be sticking their asses out so hitting someone would be easier
Amazing game
We would play the game kakas (rooster), when we would stand on one leg with our arms behind our back, and we would hop into each other, and the last man (literaly) standing was the winner
I don't really remember what we named it, but me and my former friends used to play this game where a bunch of people would sit on a bench, and one of us would just run towards the other and jump on them
I honestly don't know how, but none of us ever got injured from this game
Also, i never participated, i always just watched haha
for us its car logos/brand of cars
Don't forget the WD-40
As someone who had to endure that more than once, I can back that remark up
probably "megszentségteleníthetetlenségeskedéseitekért", I usually use it when my friends are configuring stuff on discord and ask me to say something
grammatically correct word but noone uses it unironically, plus it makes little sense
"OMG your hungarian
can you speak some hungarian
"uhmm
"cmon, pleassssseeeee"
"hát.. inkáb magyarúl beszélnék most veled, mint angolul mert te anyira nem szeretnéd megérteni, hogy mit mondok"
"ooo
what does it mean
"mi"
"what"
this is just a situation that came to mind that would sound hilarious, other than that i dont have a default phrase
translation:
"well
id rather speak hungarian with you right now instead of english because you really wouldnt want to understand what im saying that bad"
"what"
Tell them it means Hi
I prefer "for your deeds of undesecrateableness"
Well, just about every nation that we share a border with
Maybe except Austria and Croatia
Plus Slovenia, since people usually forget about them :)
Romania
We just want transylvania back, to get ethnic Hungarians to live in Hungary
They barely have any rights there
Honestly our relations with Serbia got a lot better lately and is no longer bad at all
On the other hand our relations with Ukraine got worse due to that Education Law but it's still not as bad
I don't think today's mainstream debate is about Greater Hungary, it's about the minorities
Those are real issues
That whole Greater Hungary thing is dumb, but especially in the case of Croatia
If I'm not mistaken Croatia was never a part of Hungary, we just shared a king
I've never actually heard of that guy until now, goes to show how they don't teach the negative parts of our history, I guess
A lot of Hungarians go to your beaches on holiday, so I think most people here quite like you :)
Well I think it was mostly just a few villages, so even those nationalist/irredentist types aren't too bothered about it
>If I'm not mistaken Croatia was never a part of Hungary, we just shared a king
That's a heavily debated topic, which mostly concerns the area of historical Croatia only
Syrmia and historical Slavonia were part of Hungary, that much is accepted by most
After Croatia and Slavonia were de facto united in the 16th century, the legal status of this new increasingly Croatian entity became more ambiguous though
In the end, the Hungaro-Croatian Compromise of 1868 confirmed the borders of Croatia to include Slavonia and most of the Military Frontier, but also confirmed Croatia to be part of Hungary, or to be more precise, to be part of the Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown
Give them autonomy, and in exchange they will promise to learn Romanian
seems like a deal to me and a way to make them warm up to you
Fair enough, though the common depictions you see of Greater Hungary on bumper stickers and such also include most of modern day Croatia, except Dalmatia and Istria
[Gazdálkodj okosan]
The name translates to something like Budget Smartly or Manage [your finances] Cleverly
It was inspired by a dumbed down version of Monopoly, you go around the board, collecting and losing money
The goal is to buy a house, insurance, furniture and home appliances
Despite the name, there's minimal smart budgeting involved
It's not widely played nowadays, but back in the socialist era this was one of the only board games that you could get so most households have one
Gazdálkodj okosan
Really old game, around 6 players max, you go around on rhe board and on each tile something happens to you/you can do something (examles: get a luck card -random lucky and unlucky things , go x tiles forward, you can buy something, you have to pay a fine because of something, you did something good, you can roll the eice one more time)
You start with a certain amount of money, you can get/lose money from tiles and lucky cards, and you always gez money if you complete a circle around the board
The goal is to get a house, and every furniture in it
The thing is, you need to get the money for it, you can only buy certain  furnitures on certain tiles, and buying a house also takes multiple circles around the board, because once you payed a bigger amount of money the first time you bought the house, you still need to pay like 20 or more times that amount in small bits after it, and you those after each circle you complete around the board
A game of it is REALLY REALLY LONG, in fact I have never completed a game of it
Usually you play it for 5 hours, leave everything there, go to sleep, and the next day you just say: nah, this is boring, and put the game away for the next 2 months
Sorry for the bad description, I don't know the exact English translation of some of the words
It's not widely played nowadays
I think it's depends on the family
Also it wasn't the (literally) only board game, but it was really common
We also have Capitaly, it was the Horthy-Hungary version of Monopoly
It was pretty good
Came here to see if anyone mentioned it, i'm glad

According to foreigners, Hungary is Budapest and a lake called Balaton
I know all of those cities and have been in all of them
I feel proud now
I always wonder why Kapfenberg isn't called Karpfenberg
It would make so much more sense
Zaragoza is the home of CAF railway vehicle factory, very well known
I don't think that Kosice is not known in the region
- Landskrona - (partially) Hungarian made trolleybuses were delivered there
- Marbacka (sorry, I don't have that "a" with °), Ämtervik, Sunne in Värmland - where Selma Lagerlöf spent her childhood
Okay, these aren't big cities, but known

I think Samara is also known from the Lada model, at least in the former Eastern Block
>And although people don't really speak English, I was able to utilize my Russian (rarely, because people seem to hate Russians), some German and Hungarian with the help of Google translate lol
Oh, sorry about that, Hungary has a very serious problem with foreign languages
Although, I don't think that not knowing the Russian language comes from Russophobia, just people don't really learn it nowadays as widely as before 1989
Kőszeg is very cozy and nice, Sopron on the border of Austria, Esztergom, Szeged, Pécs, Eger etc
they're all quite nice places to visit
If Calvinism is your interest, then Debrecen is definitely your destination
However, Hungary is not that religious, not even Debrecen, only 43
8% of the population said they are part of religious denomination in 2011
>Luník IX
Oh boy, that was a meme in (Northern) Hungary, too
\>  Czechoslovakia
It's hard to note the name change
My grandparents always call your country this way and they are living next to the border
Sorry about that
Although 100 years later you kinda did an Uno reverse card and Władysław II Jagiellończyk repaied the gesture by giving our nobles privileges which didn't help against the Turks
(I know he wasn't King of Poland, but he was from the royal family)
Then Debrecen would be interesting for you (besides the historically notable [Reformed Coll] and the [big one] there is a [notable smaller church] Also, there are other interesting Reformed Churches in that region, for example [Nyírbátor] Reformed Church (also the hometown of the famous/notorious Erzsébet (Elizabeth) Báthory), [the gothic Protestant Church of Avas (from the XXIII
century)] and the [Transylvanian wooden-stlyed "Deszkatemplom"] (literally plank-church) in Miskolc
DM me if you need any more information in the future
Osztrák-Magyar Monarchia (literally Austro-Hungarian Monarchy)
I'll rather explain what "k.u.k." means: it's short for "königlich und kaiserlich" (royal and imperial)
This is well known
But the cause for this is that the Austrian part of the empire had an emperor but the Hungarian part traditionally had a king (because of the Holy Crown of Saint Stephen)
The only Austrian emperor who didn't make himself crowned with the Hungarian crown was Joseph II, hence the nickname "king with the hat". And Franz Joseph wasn't crowned with the Hungarian crown until 1867, the Compromise
OMM- Osztrák-Magyar Monarchia
Osztrák-Magyar Monarchia
Osztrák-magyar monarchia
Osztrák-Magyar Monarchia (Austro-Hungarian Monarchy)
And the fancy full name:
A Birodalmi Gyűlésben képviselt Országok és Királyságok és a Magyar Szent Korona Országai
(Lands and Kingdoms represented in the Imperial Council and the Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown)
Can confirm, we both from Hungary
What does Itävalta really mean
Eastern realm
Triple yep, but it's one of the two basic solutions
Make it four
We are usually very arrogant and have strong opinions about things that we don't really know much about
Hungarian society as a whole definitely has a pessimistic, why-even-bother attitude
And that's why we are friends
Isn't this a common thing in our region
Cup of fucking tea all day sounds really nice
People here just drink coffee (or alcohol) and smoke cigarettes for those occasions, so you guys have it really good
*"Polak, Węgier, dwa bratanki, i do szabli, i do szklanki
*In english it is about:*
Pole and Hungarian brothers be, good for fight and good for party
&#x200B;
So, yeah
No wonder why, brother
Yeah, it's true
It's almost accepted to be casually racist towards them, sadly
I'm curious about the opinions of our neighbors on this as I don't think our two countries are unique in this aspect
Is everybody a rally driver there, just too introvert to go against others
The situation is very similar here
I had a romani classmate in high school, he was a really cool guy
He always said how much he hated "gypsies" as because of their behavior people judge him too and he just wants to live a normal life
According to his vocabulary there were romani: the ethnicity, and gypsy: the way of life that you just described
Our constitution has been completely re-written ten years ago by a guy on an iPad, with the people having nothing to say in the matter
Since then it has been edited several times to support the governing party, and give them supreme power through channeling every important decision through the hands of the PM, or some lackey
And yeah, that's not a joke
Actually, it is an actual meme known as "gránitszilárdságú alaptörvény" (~ "fundamental law with granite strength")
A random guy wrote the current one in 2010 on an Ipad
Then the 2/3 majority of the Fidesz fraction modified it every time when they got a new friend (or more like, another f***** oligarch)
Yeah, we have the 2/3 rule like many other countries in this comment section and the ruling party won exactly 2/3 of the seats in the last two elections, so they have full authority over the country
To respond to OP's question:
* Before 1919, the Hungarian constitution was similar in form to the British constitution, not being organised into a single law
* The first constitution in Hungary was created in 1919 under Béla Kun's communist dictatorship, and was invalidated after his removal from office
* The second constitution was created under Rákosi's communist dictatorship in 1949
It was modified numerous times, most drastically in 1989 after the fall of communism, but not abolished
* The third constitution, mentioned in the above post, is officially called Basic Law and came into effect in 2012
It has been modified eight times, the last time was last December, removing the heavily criticised administrative courts from the constitution
The judges would have been appointed by the government, which would have violated the separation of power
I'm using the conditional because they only became part of the constitution the year before, and the time was not enough for the system to be used
Are you kidding me
Almost everything we do as foreign policy I disagree with
Just to name a few:
- Supporting Russia against NATO interest
- Licking the ass of China and selling them Hungarian citizenship
- Supporting Erdrogan and his regime
- Being a general pain in the ass for common EU policy and generally trying to undermine it
- Being on bad terms with almost every EU country
- Supporting authoritarian powers around the world
The support of Erdogan, the way we handled refugees, the campaign against the EU, our relationship with Romania, our stance on Hungarians beyond the border, the "friendship" with Putin
From the top of my head
Our foreign policy is immaculate I dare say
Not that I'm aware of
Don't get me wrong, we don't have a problem with folks who want to become citizens, but there has been a large debacle on the sold citizenships(not sure how well it translates but I'm talking about "Settling Bonds" the government started to issue a few years ago)
Literally anyone could buy it without as much as a background check, and once they have it, they are free to travel around the EU with their ID and nobody would stop them
A very dangerous practice if you ask me
Depends on the kind of school they want to get into
For example: you definitely need at least professional tutoring to get into a medical university
Sure
Oh wow
Took a turn i didn't expect
Wether kakaós csiga or lángos is the superior snack
Der Nutella
>And obviously people who eat Nutella with butter are an evil virus of satan
You're missing out on that heavenly creamy feeling
I can only pity you
Atleast in Hungary, we don't have to worry about such thing, since we only have neutral articles
It's feminine; therefore la Nutella
Szerelemvonat, "Love train".
Gaaah

1 hungarian go to karaoke song:
There are two problems with train travel right now - its price and the pandemic
(Let's leave the latter one out of the question, as it is out of our hands
If it wasn't for the pandemic, the problem with international train travel in Europe is its price
Low-cost airlines can easily outcompete train travel
This means that train travel is only feasible between two close destinations that are not serviced by low-cost airlines
If price wasn't the problem, I would choose train travel for trips <12 hours by train
Any longer, I would travel by plane
A lot depends on cost and route for me
From Budapest, really anywhere with a direct connection or one transfer, especially Eastward (cheaper) would be fine
So, Lviv or Munich for example
Anywhere in the Nordics or similar distance would be a flight because train would likely require multiple connections, relatively expensive tickets, and hotel stays (I can't sleep on trains anymore)
Type of train and scenery matter, too
The trip from Budapest to Lviv is quite pleasant despite taking all day
If it were miserable, maybe I'd just fly
...yeah, the socialist kingdom of sweden
You really have to live in your own orwellian doublethink bubble to think that countries with a king for head of state are socialist in the original meaning of the word
The video is just typical vulgar US political pandering, everything that you dont like is either fascism, or socialism
Who was it unpopular with though
I can't imagine the workers being unhappy about being given stocks of the company they work at
This
I think it's safe to say that Bernie wants to go further than the Nordic countries, but knows that it is not viable in the short term
He probably advocates for implementing the Nordic model in America because it is a more achievable goal, and it would still drastically improve the lives of millions of Americans
I just want a proper ww1 grand strategy game
Can I just say your username is legendary
Isn't this just Medieval 2 though
Austria: sógorok - brother-in-laws
I won't write the Romanians's nickname, because it's offensive
I've heard "kecskebaszók" for the Turkish, which means "goatfuckers".
We sometimes call Romanians "furry feet".
We have one for you guys too
At least you don't hate us, like most of our neighbours
We call that "lyuksógor" which means "hole-sógor" or "hole-brother-in-law".
We're a small country
Most of the focus is on politics
From what I remember it's about 60% politics / the events leading up to it and why we sided with the nazis in the first place (first and second Vienna awards), 30% battles and major offenses, and 10% holocaust/deportations/massacres
Hungarian here
First we learned the history lesding up to it
The rise of NSDAP and Hitler, the rise of Stalin, the rise of Mussolini
The functioning and charachteristics of Germany, the USSR, and Italy
Ideologies
The great depression
Hungarian politics 1918-1939
Then we learnedabout the war itself, it's battles, turning points, characteristics, the most important conferences, atrocities, holocaust etc
Up until the end of the war
Then we learned about how it all went down in Hungary, what lead to us joining it, then being invaded by Germany and then the USSR, etc
Finally about what it caused: soviet occupation, bipolar world order, UN, etc
We learned about WW2 in great depth, thd 1939-1945 part of it lasted maybe for 2 weeks
Also, it's pretty detailed, we had to learn the events by day (e. g. October 23, 1942, Second battle in El Alamein Rommel vs Montgomery), it was an interesting nightmare in high school
If you picked that topic at your graduation exam, you were dead
The Union with Austria in 1867 resulted a rather spectacular era until the First World War although the system was far from being perfect
Nonetheless many Hungarian consider this period great and are proud of it and it is true that many great and memorable Hungarians were born and literature bloomed as well
I dont consider myself a nacionalist although I do tend do romanticise with specific eras and this period may be the one which I like the most (not forgetting how Hungary treated minorities and how bent prime ministers were)
We were also the SHIELD OF EUROPE AGAINST THE MUSLIMS
There were so many shields, I don't even know how the bastards got in the first place
Let's not try to use logic and context, it is unfair
Well, to be more correct, none of us were really the shield
It was more of a problem of the ottoman overstretching in areas
See
See
That's what I'm talking about
There are like 20 armor pieces in a plate armor, but everyone wants to be the shield
Nobody wants to be the nasal helmet against the muslim hordes, or the bishop mantle
I demand to be the   [Culet] against the muslim hordes
At least we could say, we saved your ass
I am not denying, it is just if you put it in context it was not a very long time till we got busted and in the meantime the turks were also engaged elsewhere too
We got beaten at Varna in 1444
Fall of  Constantinople was in 1453
Three years later they are sieging Belgrad (1456)
There was a slow conquest after that, but for example we got beaten at Mohacs in 1526 and they took Buda in 1541
After that they are almost at Vienna
We had some nice success mostly during winter campaigns and some castle we could defend, but altogether we were much weaker than their empire and our castles were not very good against cannons
Absolutely
We eat geese, duck mostly besides chicken when it comes to poultry, but also turkey
In Hungary fois gras is a big thing and it comes from geese, and that's the main purpose of geese
Duck in my opinion is way too fatty and when cooked the meat can get too dry, but I don't mind some duck in my plate
Quail eggs and also in soup is well known and we also eat pheasant and
PIGEON MEAT that is very nice too
>Duck in my opinion is way too fatty
And according to most old folks i know non-duck poultry is too dry
Kazincbarcika in northeastern hungary has to be up there
any post-industrial ghetto like Kazincbarcika, Ózd, Dunaújváros, etc
In my opinion the old mine cities are the worst
As when the mi és were close everything stopped improving and then went backwards
Just every time I go to the capital
I'm from Szabolcs - not the best reputation - and it shows in my accent
Sometimes, but they're just envy how well I can roll the R
Well, not really, but my accent is noticable
In South Hungary, this is pretty common
Mostly older people speak this
People from the capital, or from r/hungary tend to make jokes about it
So, I use a lot of ö insted of e. For example, my home town is Szeged, but I sometimes say Szöged
It is so interesting that people can _choose_ between their local dialect and hochdeutsch
Hungary being a small country doesn't really have that, even if there are some mild dialects, they are perfectly understandable, people couldn't even pretend not to understand it
I was on a business trip in Baden-Württemberg once, there were local people and also some guys from Austria (St
Pölten)
While the locals (being the hosts) tried to talk to us in hochdeutsch, so that we can easily understand them, the Austrians didn't give a fuck, and spoke Austrian
It was very well understandable, as you say, Eastern-Austrian isn't that "harsh", but it was amusing that they didn't even try
Where do I start
Compound words: dumb people write them apart or don't use a - when it's more than 7 syllables long
Unlike English, which has prepositions, Hungarian has prefixes
If the prefix is before the verb it's attached to, then it's written together (megcsináltam 'I did it'), when there is a word between them, then it's written apart (meg tudtam csinálni 'I could do it')
Dumb people write it down as "megtudtam csinálni" which literally means 'I got to know it, doing'. It's mumbo jumbo if not written correctly and so many people use it incorrectly
Hungarian is phonetically written but we have consonant shifts because it eases the pronunciation of other consonants
There is a set of rules for all this and it's very straightforward, but still a lot of people can't seem to get it
(they write k instead of k, sz instead of z and so on)
Examples:
It's készpénz and not kézpénz
('currency'; literally 'finished money', not 'hand money')
It's segítség not segíccség. It's utca, not ucca
And I could go on infinitely
We have 2 kinds of "J" letters
One written just like that, "j", and the other is written like "ly". There is no rule to why you must use "ly" in some words, they don't sound different, but they will teach you all the words with "ly" in school just so you can get angry when people swap them up
Byste = you (plural) would be
By jste = you (singular) would be
- Ender's Game: Végjáték (End game)
- Die Hard: Drágán add az életed (Give your life expensively (?))
- Alien: A nyolcadik utas: a halál (the 8th passenger: the death)

- Alien 3: A végső megoldás: Halál (The final solution: Death)
- Alien 4: Feltámad a Halál (Death ressurects)

Edit: I read once that most of the time they send like 20 title proposal to Hollywood execs, and they are the ones who choose one
Of course they don't speak Hungarian and mostly go by what looks good on the posters
At least this is how it went like 10 years ago, maybe today it improved some
Home alone is „reszkessetek betörők" which means be afraid, intruders
>Despicable Me" was translated as "Sunt Un Mic Ticălos" which means "I'm A Little Bastard".
I LOVE THIS WTF :D
Zsivány egyes
Im Hungarian it's "Gru". Fun, huh
I've been threathned several times
A guy walked into our garden and stole our copper drainpipe
He brought a screwdriver and just straight up took the whole thing

It's a really cool song
And also the obligatory Dragostea din tei
Oh, and also that Czech song "Ostrava" or something like that
Oh boy, every 90s Hungarian hit song
Just to name a few:
[Tedd fel a kezed (put your hands up)]
[Balatoni láz (Balaton fever)]
[Álomhajó (dreamship)]
[Titkos üzenet (Secret message)]
[Szomorú szamuráj (Sad samurai)]
There's a Spotify playlist for 80 hours with these
Also Dragoste de inchiriat
You forgot [Dr Bombay's Calcutta] Masterpiece
EDIT: my bad, he's Swedish
I live in Romania and I have no idea how can I have 2 flags at my flair
Very common
I mean, right now I'm sitting in an office where every single window is like that
It's not rare or seen as advanced at all
I was expecting some hi-tech "even makes you a cup of coffee" kind of windows
and you spill normal windows on us
I don't think you would see any other type of windows these days in Europe, unless you are in the UK or Ireland, where they are more rare for some reason
That is the common type, except for very old houses
Haven't seen a different window in a school my entire life
We don't have them at home usually, but in offices and public building they are the norm
Completely common
Some houses have the kind that only opens one way, but for offices, schools, government buildings etc
it's almost always the kind used
My house has old-fashioned windows but there's one of these in the bathroom
You can install window screens in european windows too
He is a great youtuber and he's showing everything about a trucker's life on the road
He is Hungarian, but as far as I know he has english subtitles on most of his videos
I loved Szirmai Gergely (Hollywood News Agency), Hungarian guy, reviewing films, and I still love him to the bottom of my heart but he just started going on multiple hiatus' all over the place and I just can't please  e n d  t h e  p a i n
Magyarósi Csaba, the hungarian Casey Neistat
Hollywood News Agency- mostly makes movie critics but in such an entertaining and informative way
Yeah hungarian youtube is really cringey and is aimed for a young audience
Csaba Magyarósi
Daily Vlog, but not for the young audience
Really interesting and quality content, and the guy is genius with the camera
I like Pamkutya, Barni and Videómánia
Lemmino is awesome
He deserves to be much higher on this list :)
Yeah, he’s one of the few Hungarian youtubers I still enjoy
And don’t forget his travel channel, he goes to awesome places and presents his journeys in exciting ways
And recently the same guy(s) made a travel vlog
I have very hard time coming up with anything else woth your time in hungarian on the platform
I personally like the "Get Germanized" guy, he does cool videos about Germany, the language and some random stuff
Ahh and also their collab gaming channel
Well its not "terrible", but its not that great either - its "just another gaming channel".
Wait, is salut a french word
Personally, I love cats
I like dogs, but don't plan to have my own
I was raised with cats and not dogs, so I just understand cats better than dogs
Without knowing the stats, I'd say we're more of a dog country
The continent
Probably cats
If we're including Turkey in Europe, definitely cats
These [stats] for Hungary say >!cats at 45% and dogs at 36%!<
Love them both, but I have currently a cat
Hungary don't have a prefernce but i guess there are more cat owners here
There are no hungarian cat breeds but I love'm all
From dogs I prefer hungarian breeds
My favourite is the Vizsla, but sadly our lifestyles isn't compatible :D
There's also Mansi and Khanty, our closes linguistic relatives
>Then there's the big dragon Ericsson
I think while it's true that Ericsson is very well known, a lot of people still think they mainly manufactured mobile phones
0 dependency living in the middle of Budapest
No, I'm not, I've been taking the bus all  the time
I am still planning on buying a car soon
I calculated that I would save around 24 hours a month from waiting to the bus (not even the difference between travelling with bus vs car) if I bought a car
I would probably only use it in occasions like today
I have classes from 9:50 at Uni, but I can only make it with the 8:12 bus that gets to the city at 8:35, meaning I get to Uni at 8:55
Sure, one hour isnt the end of the World, but its an important one hour that I'd like to save
If Istanbu is part of the balkans, then i propose, that Budapest is the most important city of the balkans
My neighbour’s kid once found a grenade while digging in the building’s garden, does that count
Seriously, though, you won’t find much pre-1900 stuff just digging around with a garden spade
Maybe a coin or something if you’re lucky
But there are some Roman ruins and lots of other old buildings that have been preserved/restored
So, in that way, history is all over
1880 isn’t anything surprising, but it is fairly old
Isn't Norse mythology has a source from a Icelander writer
Isn't is called Edda or something similar
We have the same problem with the pre-counqest and pre-christianity (and even early Árpád) period
Although the Byzantine sources are fortunately most likely accurate
Buses:
Intercity buses:
*  You pay with money (ugggh), all of the time cash, to the bus driver and he gives you a ticket, or you get a monthly "ticket" and you use it as many times are you want
Inner city buses:
* You can buy tickets at the kiosks, on the bus or at the bus station with money or bank card and you gotta use them
One ticket for one way
Train:
* You either buy a ticket at the train station (there are sellers or you can use the ticket printing machine), cash or card
* or you can use the application and its also cheaper
Thank god you have that its such a life saver
If it works
I really hope we gonna have a totally online system soon, though I dont use much public transportation because my city is very small
Budapest transport area has ticket machines that accept either cash or card
They’re trying to unroll a mobile system, but they’re mostly miserable at doing so
Single tickets are therefore mostly paper and have to be validated by printing the date&time with a machine on the bus/metro entrance
I don’t see them making e-cards available in the near future
Hungarian Railways however have now a working app with online payments and mobile tickets
Other bigger cities have various city-systems similar to the capital
But then most places you buy form the bus driver, or in their office, a newspaper shop or a tobacco shop
I’d prefer not to have paper tickets at all anymore, but I only can dream
I so want to have a system like this
Well, we still have paperbased tickets/passes in most of the country
We can pay with cash or card of course
In Budapest, there is an app, which lets you have your ticket on your phone, you get a QR code for it and you have to show the ticket inspectors that
For the latter option you can only pay with your online bank account
(Is that the correct term
The RIGÓ flew too close to the sun and burned up :(
My classmates dad makes props for movies and he always shouts "silicone boobs
We have 3 different here in Hungary
The basic one is "csíz", which is pronounced exactly like cheese
The other one is "itt repül a kismadár" which means: here flies the little bird
The third one (my personal favourite) is "szifilisz", which means syphilis
Its possible there are more, but i only know these
Anything that comes to mind
Csízz (pronounced like cheese) is popular though
I've heard that one
:-D
But usually we just say "Csíz!" (pronounced the same as cheese, but it could also mean siskin - a bird species)
I have never heard that one, however we dont have a universal word, that everybody use, so its possible that a lot of peolpe use vizibicikli too
Some of my classmates used that
Guess it changes by region to region
"wheres that
ik i shouldnt expect ppl to know where every single country is, especially the smaller ones, but it still makes me kinda sad :(
Are you hungry
Even the best jokes get stale after you've heard them hundreds of times
Don't say the "hungry" joke and for fuck's sake don't bring up what fucked up shit our government is doing atm
We all know it and we're tired of it
Hungarian here
Once in London after telling the guy where I was from "Hungary", the reaction was: " and are you" suggesting whether I was hungry to which I said " well done, did you manage to come up with this on your own, or you heard this joke from someone else - but anyhow it's a good one, hahaha
But other than that nothing really
I don't really care about my nationality, other than the language it doesn't mean much to me
I travelled a lot around Europe and stayed in hostels mostly
I met all sorts of people from all around the world and I would say about 90% knew where Hungary was and about 50% have already visited Hungary
I was always amazed when they even knew the history of our country, it is always great to listen to a stranger talk about your country's history
But do you
>Even the best jokes get stale after you've heard them hundreds of times
Let alone this one, which has never been funny in the first place
Wait
So you want to tell me that France is more than just Paris, and Paris is more than just the area surrounding the Eiffel tower
Those damn American movies lied to me
I've once heard that Bulgarians are particularly annoyed by the phrase "Russian alphabet" when people refer to the Cyrillic alphabet
Is that true
Also, happy liberation day
Do people ever bring up Communism and the USSR
Nothing about Nazis
All the other Germans said that
Do you believe in Zeus
To be fair, about [2000 people do]
My favourite one is when they say
“ohh are you from Hungary
I visited Prague last summer”
Cool bro
Yes but that's not the point
"Where are you from
"Switzerland"
"I mean where are you really from
"Oh, I'm originally American"
"I mean
Where are your parents from
"<Same american country>"
"And your grandparents
I mean
Polar bear
>That being said, I think Germany did a good job in reflecting on their darkest days and being open and honest about it
Bro, I think Germany is no
1 in the entire world when it comes to dealing with its dark past
Very few countries are **this** open about **everything**. I have a great deal of respect for Germany and the Germans for this fact alone
In paper bags
>I think it's Luxembourgian because that's what the spell checker isn't complaining about
I think the language is Luxembourgish and the people are Luxembourgers
Beat them up so bad that only an Ikea Engineer could put them back together
>Smoking in paper bags
We call this "szipu"  and I think its beautiful
We arent the first at things, we are usually third or second at everything, but it kimda matches our mindset
Here is an interesting fact though:
There were only two olympics where hungarian athletes didn't win a Gold Medal: the 1920 Antwerp olympics and the 1984 Los Angeles olympics
Hungarians weren't invited to Antwerp because of the country was on the losing side of the war
And Hungary boycotted the 1984 olympics as a revenge for the American Boycott of the 1980 Moscow olympics
Viceroy
Not (co-)prince
I hope so, the Shaolin brothers know how to skate
I just vote for my ruling party
The Dutch likewise
What about Schupfnudeln
Wouldn't that be the same kind of crime like pineapple pizza or pasta with ketchup
Interesting, I didn't know about it, but it seems like the Semmelknödel/Kartoffelknödel (bread dumplings / potato dumplings) duality is present also in Italy
Waterpolo maybe
It's big in the Balkans and some neighbouring countries
Sitting near the EU contries and complaining how better would it be to sit with turkey and russia
We would probably be the sexy college girl, the first to drink ourselves under the table, with our pal Poland (but they might be able to hold their booze), so Austria would have to take us home
Due to that all the other countries would think we're annoying, beautiful, but annoying
Also you would be delighted to be fed
Oh, also being sassy with Romania, cause the rest of the countries asked us to share the fish, and Romania took the front, which was suddenly our favorite
And offering everyone pálinka all the time, and getting offended, when they refuse the 6th shot
Romania is a Balkan country
There was a fantastic series made like 10 years ago, that took Hungary's whole history, and followed it objectively from the early tribal times to current days
It took ALL the legends and stories people are taught in school, or common beliefs held, and examined them in a capable historian's eye
Most had to be debunked, or at least corrected
Every nation needs a series like [this
They leave out the raping, pillaging, stealing and the systematic destruction of their culture and people
Those are the most fun parts
Edit: Words
We rarely get talked about
Do share if you have some
A lot of people here believe that you are just stolen Hungarian land so that's one
In Hungary during the Rákosi regime (1947-1953), it is absolutely correct
Just change KGB to ÁVH
Although, it doesn't apply to the whole of the Eastern Bloc
Did you tell her you chose to become gay after seeing the Photos of Putin riding a ~~horse~~ bear half naked

Or am I mixing it with someone else
We learn about the finn-soviet war, and on language class we speak about Finnland and the other uralic languages a little bit more
You don't expect, but I think, we should learn more about Croatia
We learn about the unification with Hungary, then Jelasics and the Hungarian-Croatian Ausgleich
Exept of these Croatia is barely mentioned
Even we rarely learn about Croatia and we were under the same crown for a better half of a millenia
We have a common history, of course we learn some things about it
Someone mentioned that until Josip Jelačić, Croatia isn't mentioned, but it's not true
Actually, Miklós Zrinyi (Nikola Zrinski) was of Croatian background, and also the first named Hungarian poet, Janus Pannonius (Csezmicei János - Ivan Čezmički) has both Hungarian and Croatian origins
And they both are very important figures of Hungarian history and culture
In Hungary we learn about both Miklós Zrinyi  (the one who fought in the siege and the one who wrote about it)
In literature class we lare taught even more about the author one's life
considering a whole election was won by making people believe that immigrants will destroy our country but our holy government can protect them, i'd say we're not very friendly
(hungary)
As a Hungarian, I don't wanna talk about it
just look at our fence at the border
we really do need another government
As a Hungarian, I don't wanna talk about it
just look at our fence at the border
As a Hungarian, I don't wanna talk about it
just look at our fence at the border
we really do need another government
nah, it's actually the first day of the final exams for high schoolers so yeah, definitely not a day off
Everyone I know showers once a day
Some do it in the morning (get freshened up for the day ahead), others in the evening (wash away the day's worries, go to bed clean)
If we get sweaty, we might shower more, but 1/day is the default
Shower only since I'm like 10 always in the evening or after workout
I can't stand going into bed without one no matter what
Bathing in the tub is a waste of time and likely bad for the skin
Once every day (or every other day, once in a while) is pretty normal
If by bathe you mean filling up the bathtub with water and sitting in it, I haven't done that in years, I prefer quick showers in the morning and the evening
Never
Not once has that ever crossed my mind
Ever
im studying law so who else could it be but Iustinianus
Aurelian Restitutor Orbis, because of what could have been if he wasn't assassinated
He managed to pull the Empire together during the Crisis of the 3rd Century, and it says a lot that neither the Senate nor the Army wanted appoint a successor after his death
Or maybe Antoninus Pius, because he was only supposed to be a "placeholder" until Marcus Aurelius was old enough to rule, but he ruled for 23 years
Those two decades might have been the most peaceful 23 years of the Empire
Or maybe Claudius, who was ostracised by his family, but he did a surprisingly good job as Emperor
Okay, last maybe
Diocletian
Not for the Tetrarchy or his milliard reforms, but for his cabbages
Do you have a city or region in your country you often joke about or look down on
Just interested
Miskolc and the surrounding area is jokingly referred to as the Alabama of Hungary, but as far as I know only in recent memes
The city Miskolc, we call it our Florida/Alabama
(Jokingly of course)
I live in the netherlands
I look down at all of belgium
I think we moved on from that
Now we harrass Miskolc for being poor and dirty
Borsod is just shitty af but nice in its own way
> it doesn't have any cities, and its capital town is in Hungary
Maybe because all the other parts too used to be in Hungary
Btw there are some nice towns like Kismarton (Eisenstadt) or Nagymarton (Mattersburg) or Ruszt (Rust)
Trollhättan is the birthplace of the NOHAB locomotives
We Hungarians will always love Trollhättan
Etyekwood in Hungary built by Andy Vajna, producer of Terminator
Hell yeah
Those locomotives were withdrawn from everyday service in 2000, but the special historic trains are still always filled with passengers whenever they organize one
Budapest (1 750 216) > Debrecen (201 112) > Szeged (160 258)
Budapest is a well-known metropolis, politically left-wing
Everything is here
Debrecen is a large village on the plain next to the Romanian border with a huge Calvinist Church in the middle, politically right-wing
Seems boring to me
Szeged is a lovely tiny city, that has a large city center that could fit a more populous city
The Tisza, a large river is crossing the middle of the city which gives a tiny Budapest feeling
It is one of the large cities that are governed by the socialist
Also, they serve great fish soup
Definitely worth a visit
>Cracow
Looks so strange to me as I have always used Kraków /Krakow/Krakkó. What is the difference between them
Budapest isnt politically left leaning, it is closer to the left per se, but its definietly not a politically unified city
Some districts are left and some are right strongholds
Szeged and Debrecen are pretty similar, but with their own uniqueness
Both have strong universities with rich and significant history, and are basically a huge culturally significant and hisotrically rich city-centers with a hundred thousand people big village attached to them
The main difference is that Szeged is catholic and Debrecen was the center of the reformation in Hungary
Szeged is socialist, Debrecen is traditionally a Fidesz stronghold
Culture wise Szeged has a lot of unique cultural things attached to it's name, while Debrecen's culture is very attached to it's history
It was the capital of Hungary several times and called the Calvinist Rome in Hungary
>Rome is the 3rd most visited city in Italy, while Milan and Naples are the 7th and 9th, respectively
How
I thought Rome has to be the first and Milan could be the second or Venice
Edit: Ok, I have checked it is Bolzano
Interesting, who would have known there are so many people staying in the mountains
If Zoo then Nyíregyháza
I know it's mainstream, but lives up to the name
My favourite is the zoo in Győr, alhtough Hungary is very strong in the zoo game
The zoo in Nyíregyháza, Győr, Budapest and Szeged are amazing
The latter having many endangered species
There is a hotel attached to the zoo, nd if you book rooms there you can visit the zoo any time while you are there
It's a very unique zoo experience, you dont have to rush to visit everything
You can just sit there with your ice creame and truly watch the wonderous creatures there
Is is mandatory in hungary, with 99% vaccinated, we even have a small booklet named “Oltásikönyv” where the dates of vaccinations are shown
Yes, even the living ones
Yes
We literally translate every ruler’s name and title, from Extinct Tribe leaders from the Americas to the far end of the East
We have several handbooks for transcribing Chinese, Korean, Anglo-sax, Argentinian, “Arabian”, “African”, etc

I just toured through Northern Spain this summer and it was indeed amazing
Not mentioning the obvious big cities: Puente la Reina, Hospital de Órbigo, Molinaseca, O'Cebreiro and Fisterra were outstanding to me
There are few more derisive adjectives than describing something as "balkáni" in Hungarian
The stereotype is corruption, poverty, uncivilized conditions
Like saying that the railway company is run in Balkan style or the approach of the mayor is really "Balkan-like" is an insult
Similar to talking about banana republics
If we're being pedantic, then Felvidék! The accent is required ;)
I'm freelance now bit at my last workplace Fridays the boss always brought donuts to everyone

For Hungary, I'd nominate Tankcsapda - Mennyország tourist
Thy Catafalque - Embersólyom (avantgarde/folk/metal)
FISH
- Gyere ki a rétre
Hooligans - Túlélő
Kies - Nincs az a sor, amibe szívesen beállnék
hmm there are so many great alternative rock-ish bands in hungary, it's hard to choose
the 'national anthem' would be tankcsapda - mennyország tourist but my personal choice is either esti kornél - nem kár or elefánt - bordahajtogató
so yeah, choose one
Yeah, Szélvész is my favourite track from the album Naiv
New album coming in 25th June
Probably [Ferenc Szálasi] He was the leader of our national socialist government and he was a huge fanatic of his fascist ideology
Rudolf and Ferdinand II, I guess
Quite literally actually
Several contemporary psychiatrists considered him to be mentally ill and based on the parts of his journal I’ve seen he really seemed to be crazy even beyond your average fascist leader’s level
In 2013 a doctor mutiliated his ex-girlfriend by pouring alkali on her, because she'd broken up with him a few months prior
His uncle is a well-known politician so the investigation wasn't as quick as it could be and in the end the police said he's free to go
After this, the victim hired a private lawyer or somethng like that and the case was reinitiated
For a while this case was debated a lot, but I think the publicity got tired of it
As far as I know he was sentenced for 11 years but he sued the prison for the bad conditions and recieved about 1400 € as compensation, meanwhile his victim got nothing and her life is ruined
It was an interesting and quite brutal case for sure
My information might be incorrect, so if anyone knows more about it please correct me

There is so many I will just put this here:
There was a big germanisation attempt by the Habsburgs so we have a ton of loan words
I’m Western Hungarian and never heard even though my family is of German origin and we use a ton of German words
Might be a Transylvanian Hungarian phrase, maybe borrowed from Transylvanian Saxon
I may be wrong though, in other parts of Hungary they might use it, I just don’t know about it
I don't see them often
They aren't viewed in any other way
Not that common but people don't really care
I have long hair (well below shoulders) and never got anything for it
Younger men are more likely to grow their hair though
Dreadlocks are semi-common
It's not common, but walking on the streets you will definitely see some
> least one in every programming team
Every team has a satanist-sarcastic man with long hair, a short smart ass with glasses, an anxious but energetic member and a normie who does the half of the work when nobody watches
Except the dadjoke-grade "I thought you were a girl".
Might just be the people I'm around, but I've known quite a few guys with long hair
Mine has been long for a few years now, but I don't feel like i've been looked at wierd because of it
Frankly THOSE teachers are like football hooligans, they are justblooking for an excuse to attack students, long hair is not something special, its just a decent excuse to be a garbage human being
Two names:
_Imádkozó sáska_: Praying Locust
_Ájtatos manó_: Pious Pixy
Imádkozó sáska
Which means
well
praying mantis
sáska, sás meaning bush foliage or thicket, the kind of natural obstacle meant to be cut with a machete; -ka is a belittling/nicknaming affix
Hát dögöljek meg de én még a kurva életbe nem hallottam, hogy bárki is azt mondta volna, hogy ájtatos manó. :D
Ez ilyen helyi dolog, vagy a standard magyar nyelvben előforduló szó? :D
Religious mantis sounds so funny I love it :D
Sáska is locust
Mantis is imádkozó sáska
It's never used in everyday speech though, just something for the taxonomy books
Ne dögölj meg, tényleg mondjàk rá
Amúgy én se hallottam még ezt a verziót sosem
Olyan mintha valami külföldi próbálna létrehozni magyar szavakat xD
A wikipédiát bekötötték már falun
Az imádkozó sáska vagy ájtatos manó (Mantis religiosa) a rovarok (Insecta) osztályába sorolt fogólábúak (Mantodea) rendjéből, az imádkozó sáskák (Mantidae) családjából az egyetlen, Magyarországon is honos faj
EDIT: minuszolgathatjátok, pedig amilyen az adjonisten, olyan a fogadjisten (ez talán ismerős mondás), nem én indítottam úgy, mintha egy darab szarral beszélnék.
EDIT2: na jó, akkor innentől kezdve az itteni magyarokra ignore on, kérem, hogy legyen ez kölcsönös. Ha erre a színvonalra volnék kíváncsi, pestis rácokat meg egyéb szennyet olvasnék.
>A wikipédiát bekötötték már falun
Anyád?
>Az imádkozó sáska elnevezés kissé félrevezető, mivel nincs rokonságban a valódi sáskákkal; legközelebbi rokonai a csótányok és a termeszek
Érdekes
A koma csak közölte, hogy ő ezt a kifejezést sosem hallotta, illetve megkérdezte, hogy az ájtatos manó esetleg tájszólas része-e - mindezt kicsit trágár módon, ez tény, de számomra (meg mivel nem csak én mínuszoltam, így ha jól sejtem, más számára is) egyértelműen nem a másikat támadóan
Erre az a nyomorult meg egyből úgy válaszolt neki, mintha a seggéből rángatta volna elő, meg itt falusizik
Nem adjonisten-fogadjisten van itt, mint amit ez a balfasz ugat, hanem kurva nagy arrogancia, meg a másik lekezelése, ezért kapja a mínuszokat

In Hungary, it's really disrespetful too, to confuse Budapest with Bucharest
But i think the most disrespectful thing you can say to a Hungarian is that Trianon was fair
Are you guys really that upset if someone confuses Bucharest with Budapest or vice versa
We don't really get upset over that
But I guess the topic of the Trianon treaty is a pretty dangerous topic which most likely will lead to someone getting insulted, so it's just best not to bring it up
I like the stereotypical French person from Monty Python even more
You know, with striped t-shirt, black beret, a cloth around the neck and a moustache
Like this:
We should change the name of Budapest and Bucharest Just for like a week
We already have PMs with the same name, so why not
I'm always a little bit confused when I read these countries in English
In Hungarian it's no problem: Lettország - Litvánia
It had a very welcome side effect in form of our Ausgleich
South Canada
The Bucharest-Budapest allience of Orbans
Think of the memes
We had our own version of Nazism called Hungarism
It's basically the same but with Hungarians as the center of the universe, not Germans
They were tried and hanged
Also counting forts:
* Hungary: Buda (Citadel & Castle), Eger, Sümeg, Visegrád
* Romania: Deva, Hunedoara, Oradea, Alba Iulia, Sighisoara, Targu Mures
* Ukraine: Mukachevo
* Italy: Sirmione
* Norway: Bergen
* Germany: Königstein
Maybe also Prague and Krakow, but I was too young to remember
There are probably also others that I missed
If we also count palaces, there are probably a few others as well
Well I live in Northeastern Hungary, an hour North and I'm in Slovakia, an hour East and I'm in Transylvania
Both of which are filled with castles
I've seen too many to remember all,.but the best were Bran castle in Transylvania and Bojnice in Slovakia
Edit: Also I live next to a castle
Castle (aka
Fortified residence) wasridiclously common
Pre-1600s, it was as common as your local police department (filling a somewhat similar function)
Thus if the area in question was populated at that time, the chances are that there used to be one top of a hill or in a swamp somewhere near
Ofc
depending on the a material it was made out of it could have been destroyed by the elements, or it could have been demolished to reduce the chances of successfull rebellions, or because it was a "burgeois relic".
But in general there are to many to count
My hometown used to have one (stone castle, middle of large swampland - blown up after habsbhrgs beat the uprising in 1848), 5km away my gramma's village used to have one (claybrick + earth + wood, rotted away due to disuse)
There are ridickously common, or at least were common - depending on political clkmate and materials they were made out of
Doesn't Slovakia have more castles per capita than any other country
Buda "castle" is a palace since the 1800s, while citadel is/was a castle/fort (now its an unoccupied fortress - as castle implies fortress where somebody lives)
Its mostly to do with british nobility not getting fucked over in multiple world wars, and retaining their stuff
Here in Hungary castles that were not turned into palaces before communism are in various state of ruin (hence no one can live in them, they are not even remotely fit for that), and the ones turned into palaces function as hotels, since original owners were either killd or fled
There are a few like the citadell in budapest that were in a location where demolishing them couldnt be done by blowing it up, and using machines and manual labor was just too much hassle
(And even before that - in the 1850s - Habsuburgs had a "blow up the castle" campaign after the 1848 rebellion, as retaking a casgle in the middle of 20 square km of swamp - like the one in my hometown - wasnt an experience anyone wanted to repeat
A Hungarian panvocalic word would have to be 14 syllables long, containing aáeéiíoóöőuúüű. An expression containing all vowels: vízi hosszúbukó-alámerülő működés.
In hungarian there is  'fiaiéi' which means 'the properties of his sons'.
I see your aeiouyåäö and challenge you to aáeéiíoóöőuúüű.
Or árvíztűrő tükörfúrógép
but they are not panvocalic
That's only the accented ones
Shit you're right
My bad
No, not at all
It's more common on trams
Only after 8pm
The Csángós are technically colonists, right
It's quite difficult to understand them at first
They use a lot of Romanian loanwords and they didn't adopt most of the language reforms of the 18-19th centuries
I speak perfect American English having grown up there and once been on a plane sat next to a man (bloke) from Manchester, around 2002 or so
He kept talking, showing me a newspaper with some terrorist, but I didn't have a clue as to what he was saying but he hated them
After a few minutes he gave up as well as I.
It has to be the end of the first WW and the Treaty of Trianon and the territorial losses that came with these events
Probably the 1848 revolution and the Treaty of Trianon
These 2 things have had the most effects on how we see ourselves as a nation
The revolution and war of independence of 1848-49, the treaty of Trianon from 1920 and the revolution of 1956
With all these revolutions for freedom you'd think that most people aren't far-right and fascist
I don't understand how you can put emphasis on fights for freedom while believeing in the opposite
I guess freedom has a very different meaning for some
The treaty of Trianon by a landslide
⅔ of the country was taken from it
And we just can't let go of it, it happened over 100 yrs ago, and people still talk about it as if it was last week
I would say March 15 1848
While important of course, if we’re looking for the most defining, it has to be the partition of Hungary after Trianon
Pacalpörkölt, I have to suppress my gag reflex even though I'm just thinking about it
I can only eat it when I'm terribly drunk

Something called Töltött Káposzta
It's cabbage stuffed with meat and rice
The concept isn't bad, but it always smells like farts
Like, it smells like farts so much that I almost threw up on multiple occasions
Yea krumplicukor does sound like some commie shit they wanted as a cheap alternative to actual food
Hungarians tend to clap the actors back in the theatre after a performance at least three times, -or even more- no matter how they liked the play
Even if they think that the performance was utter rubbish, the back-clapping is a must
Here if you don't drink you're gay or a pussy
I'm both
Two years ago, for the first time since its premiere in Hungary, none of the channels aired it
Fortunately most newspapers and news sites wrote about the travesty waiting to happen, so people had time to emotionally prepare themselves
The order of the universe was restored last year, fortunately
Is that a tradition in Poland aswell
We Hungarians tought its only our weird thing
We also have the bag with bags
We moved to our current apartment 4 years ago, I think the bottom of the bag has bags even older than that
Not my country but don't see any Danes commenting
The [Moesgaard Museum] in Aarhus is the best museum I've ever been in
By that I don' mean it's objects are the most rare/fascinating/beautiful but that they are shown in a way to construct narratives and stories to engage the visitors on a personal level
It certainly did a better job at communicating the ideas of history and culture than any other museum I've been in
At least for me, this approach was totally revolutionary since museums I was familiar with before are basically storage rooms with labels
It's very prevalent
Not as much as McD's but tied with Burger King
Breaded, fried chicken has been extremely popular in Hungary for a very long time, so they didn't have a hard time becoming popular as well
I'm just sorry they don't offer classic (not hot&spicy) chicken strips anymore
there are only 3 KFCs in my town (Szeged, Hungary, with 200
000 people) but it's much better than McDonald's and Burgerking in my opinion
Unfortunately, I can't find the number of KFCs in Hungary
They are present, you can find them fairly commonly (not as common as a McDonalds though) but I think their prices are too high for average Hungarian wages :/
If I couldn't cook I would have died already or something
Not be able to cook is just beyond me
Like, how the fuck you can even survive here
Pre-made food is not cheap here, so financially the best choice is that you cook
Czechia and Poland
Goulash gang ️
Yep, they are the ones that come to mind
Well, no wonder
It used the be the case:D
budapest is by far the biggest city; it has so much more life than any other part of the country, it's like a different world
honestly a lot of hungary just feels like a 3rd world country but the capital is a solid 2nd
i guess even the people who live here are so much more different than the rest of the country; it shows pretty well in the last municipal elections as in everything was orange (conservative party who gains votes by hating on various groups - just the usual stuff) while budapest was at least colorful with more liberal parties winning
budapest existing is the only reason I don't want to leave the country, it's such a cool and beautiful place and im so fortunate to live here
That's a pretty terrible payout for a lottery
Are there 10 winners total
The whole country is on a track to get diplo annexed by either russia or china
Isn't Burgenland named after three castles that aren't even located there
Hungarian living in Denmark
Here, in DK all dogs are chipped and registered, heck, even dog insurance is mandatory here
Not a single stray dog, except mine who tends to leave our garden sometimes on her own volition
but that’s hardly stray :) Also, weirdly enough what I heard is that even shelters are empty over here (maybe a Dane could back me up on this)
As for Hungary, I remember growing up we had some, but now that I think of it I hardly see any in Budapest, not sure about the countryside
Dogs are chipped now, but there are still some owners who don’t update the address, or are irresponsible, and poor doggos get lost and end up in shelters
There are lots of dogs in shelters
People, don’t buy, adopt
Hungarian living in the countryside chiming in
I'd say stray dogs - and dogs who have owners but don't give a fig about their dogs' whereabouts - are still a pretty big problem over here, especially in villages, towns and the outskirts of cities
A fair amount of people here don't get their dogs chipped - and thus vaccinated since you can't get your dog vaccinated unless they have a chip already - which raises an even greater risk at a potential encounter
Shelters are usually at full or nearly full capacity, and the numbers don't seem decrease in the long run (it doesn't help that the workers at quite a few shelters are condescending towards potential adopters from time to time; still a lot of people want their dogs to be primarily outdoor dogs which is prohibited by the adoption rules; and that Hungarians in general value personal privacy, so the random and - on paper - frequent visits from shelter workers as checkups are really off-putting)
As for the "adopt, don't shop" mentality, I'd say it's okay to pay for a dog if you get them from a legitimate breeder (I hope that's the correct word in this context) with certificates and pedigree
It's the backyard breeders who should not be funded furthermore
They are amongst the main reasons for full shelters and seriously unhealthy dogs
So I'd say "adopt or shop responsibly".
That's interesting, because it's the opposite in Hungary in my experience
The usually require you to use a blue pen when signing or filling out official forms
And guess what, it is the same reason for requiring black in other countries - I mean photocopies, but from an earlier era
IFAIK

Why is it risdansk

I think Sami doesn't have a seperated language family, I think it is an Urgric language although once I read something about that genetically Saami people are not related to "Ugric people" yet their language is an Ugric language
Yes you are absolutely right but still Saami doesn't have a seperated language family as that Dutchman said
Croque monsieur
And ciabatta + green pesto + smoked ham + tomatoes + mozzarella  = panini (pressed & grilled)
Freshly baked Zsemle (Semmler, a kind of bread roll), butter, Párizsi (Parizer or extrawurst or something like that), Cheddar or a similar cheese, and a few slices of fresh, salted cucumber
Serve with a few cherry tomatoes and the spiciest pepper you can find
I have to give it to the Americans, they know their sandwiches
Reuben for me
Smoked ham,cheese,salad is my favorit, but it really depends on what's in the refrigerator
Sliced chicken with paprika on it + cheese cream + cheese + Pirosarany (wich is basically pepper cream ) + sausage
Schnitzel sandwich
the fact that no bad political news have happened recently
Österreich bitte
I'd choose Austria, because it's close enough to visit relatives home
Generally people in Hungary look at Austria as a country similar to them, but better in almost every aspect
The average Hungarian doesn’t harbor any resentment against Austria, but I’m not sure about vice versa
I know that people in Burgenland are a bit fed up with the influx of Hungarian workers, but that is understandable given the amount of Hungarians going working there
As for the rest of Austria I can’t say
On the topic of the empire, I literally never heard anyone complain
Having said that, our history classes teach a lot about the revolution of 1848, but ppl don’t seem to have strong feelings either way
They’re teaching it as that “glorious revolution against our oppressors”, but most people just don’t jump on that bandwagon
i think they're pretty fine, especially since as a student i get 50% off
getting to balaton from budapest (roughly a 1,5 hour journey) costs about 3€ if not less for me
(granted, it's barely in time but still
as long as i can afford it)
I only know about the Armed Forces HQ being located in Fehérvár. Everything else is in Budapest, I guess
Dante's The Inferno
I couldn't understand like half the sentences
I put it down pretty fast
(It was in a 200 year ols translation)
Also, basically anything
I love reading but fuck those books they make us read in high school
ETA Hoffmann was horrible, they should probably give drugs so people can follow the story
Brecht: Mother Courage was also a nightmare
Otherwise I found something enjoyable in all of the others
We had to read it in Hungarian because its such a masterpiece
I was bored even by the shortened version
I think it was pretty good, but i was really into history
I think anything Móricz Zsigmond is worse to read
His works are painfully boring and the stories are so bland
The Hungarian form is 'huncut' which means something like a naughty (obviously the non-sexual meaning) or a playfully misbehaving child
No, I don't, and my family generally thinks we don't have nearly enough income
I personally
I could use a new laptop, a new cellphone, a lot of new clothes, a driver's license (it's pretty expensive around here, around 6-700€ to make one) among other things, but we don't have enough money for either of these
I imagine it's much different in Western Europe and in Scandinavia, though, so definitely don't take my opinion as every European's feelings
>I mean the federal reserve listed the median income as 35k in the US, and the median income is 27k in the UK and about the same in France/Spain
Is  this before/after tax
Americans never say the income with taxes
Yeah, but we Europeans often do
A lot of times and it's pretty bad since I'm still a student
It happens multiple times a day
Isn't that already a thing though
Like you can easily make a post with e.g: "Germans(or any other nationality) what do you think about

It's a surprise to see a Liechtensteiner but a welcome one
M1 often nicknamed as Royal Channel or Royal Tv
It's an extremely biased channel towards Fidesz, and portrays opposition as traitors to the country
It is also a public funding draining hole
M1 is one of if not **the** most biased channel there is
It's pure government propaganda
My family's guilty pleasure is watching it while laughing our arses off listening to the tremendous amount of bullcrap
one could say it is the main propaganda channel of the Government
One could also say they probably launder a lot of money through it, via overpriced advertisements, which isn’t laundering because they made it legal :-) I’m not saying these things, but one could
Not really
It existed before governments existed
And there are religious people who are against the government
And one could also say
>!Népszopás!<
You are kurvára correct
In Hungarian there’s no way to say “hers” or “his”
Everything is just “theirs”
Therefore Hungarian is the perfect language for communism
In Hungarian, there is no order for words in a sentence, like in german
You dont need to follow a rule about this, because you will never get a "wrong" sentence
You can express anything because we have so many words for feelings etc
Bad thing about hungarian:
Its the natural difficulty of the language
There is no similar language to hungarian, therefore its harder the learn another language
Hungarian is the worst language, i don't even know why i say things the way i say them
There are too many rules and you have to conjugate almost everything
That food belongs to the collective
The lack of gender in the grammer is actually my favourite part of the language
Wait, what
I thought I was familiar with this language
What does "övé" and "övék" mean then
There is word order but it isn't as strict as in indo european languages
Welcome to the Soviet Union comrade
Ugor language gaaang
I can say it’s an absolutely beautiful language that we are beyond blessed to learn as Hungarians
But it’s pretty goddamn useless for everyone else lol
Ya you just add an é after the name (keviné)
Kinda like with English (kevin’s)
I think the comment is a little bit confusing I think
We indicate the number of holders of the property, I think OP wanted to say we just don't make a difference between females and males in the grammar
It means theirs just in the sense of referring to one person
Isn't the difference that y/ý is "hard" and it doesn't make the soft version of some consonants that are before it
While i/í is "soft", so it softens those consonants
Like ti, ni, di etc
Or at adjective declination: some adjectives have the ending -ý in male nominative singular, others -ní in neutral (EDIT: not just neutral, that's the whole point) nominative which is much easier to declinate
In german skirt is male and trousers are female
True equality <3
I think you're wrong
The English language also has a gender neutral pronoun, but they recently chose to use "they", because "it" traditionally refers to objects or animals
We have _only_ gender neutral pronouns, since we don't have grammatic genders at all
I fail to see why would this mean that we don't have an expression which would indicate the posession of a single entity
It is "övé" and it means his/hers/its at the same time in English
And it clearly is different from "övék" which is theirs
Your formulation was very misleading, I think
It would have been more appropriate if you had just written "We don't have grammatic genders". It was too specific and false this way
You obviously seem right man
My comment was mostly a joke though so I really wasn’t trying to offend anyone or misinform
I can safely say I only know Hungarian because of my family and living here and have never learned the actual rules of it lol
We have a similar tradition: j/ly
They are both pronounced exactly alike (same as the Czech "j"), but they used to be different, "ly" was like "lj" in South Slavic languages
Nowadays it's also crucial for little schoolers to memorize the words using "ly" because making a mistake in this topic makes you look like an illiterate buffoon
XD I never thought about it that way
oh boy
_Indivisibiliter ac Inseparabiliter intensifies_

Austria, Slovenia, Croatia: fine
Slovakia: wouldn't last a year
Serbia, Ukraine: instant civil war
Romania: apocalypse
lol good luck
It could work with Austria, Slovenia and Croatia but with the rest no way
Hungary's closest neighbor to my location is Slovakia
*This isn't going to go well
Come back, we need you
We can't do shit on our own
All those proclamations to reverse Trianon had finally worked
imagine a union with all our neighbours
Honestly I think you guys should just keep the nukes you found in ~~Kaliningrad~~ Prussia
I mean an Austria-Hungary v2 is something I wouldn't mind
&#x200B;
**not sure about the others tho**
Gotta get rid of the speed bump up north like last time :P
Feels like we've done that before
Only Ukraine wasn't really a part of it
hence my comment
Tbh on paper a bigger unit could make more sense, but considering the relationships and good old nationalism here and there it Sounds pretty disastrous
No idea
ahaha I expected exactly this, its so great
Haha, I went to school in the 90’s, at geography class we had to fix our books and draw the new borders into Yugoslavia
I thought it was super fun I got permission to vandalize my school book
On the other hand we lived near the border and seen and heard the war, it was so messed up as a kid
Well, it existed physically, and parts of it were made of metal, so you were not that wrong
In the other hand, I imagined state borders as red stripes on the ground, or at least as a river or a ditch
There is a joke that a Hungarian migrates to Belgium, and he's drafted
On the first day in the military, the drill sergeant says:
"The Flemish shall line up on the right hand side, and the Walloons shall line up on the left hand side
He asks awkwardly:
"And where shall the Belgians stand
I wonder how on earth they figured that out
Damn
Actually I was preteen so I didn’t care so much, but it was all over the news
We silently watched what happened, actually Hungary had a lot of political and economic problems at that time and most adults concentrated to that
I remember that people got stressed out when NATO started the bombing
Hungary was already a NATO member and we had some military airports
(I don’t remember if they were used by the NATO or not) What I actually remember is the  planes flying across the sky and we could hear the bombs at night when the wind blown from south
Some people were afraid that Hungary somehow gets into the conflict because of the Vojvodina area
This area has a lot of Hungarian ethnicity and we all know some Hungarians always wanted to take back the lands which were ours before WWI
Fortunately it was never an option (as I know)
That’s all I can recollect from the war and the Hungarian refugees
Some kids attended my school
It was so fucking sad to meet those kids
They were confused and had only sad stories about their home
edit: grammar mistakes
Yeah it's a quite frequently used practice in my family, but to be honest only because we don't have big enough tables around
We like to eat, but really
What do you mean by that
Is this rude in any country
I don't know about you but I haven't experienced this at all
Especially not in Budapest where you have all sorts of food stands and takeaway places, but not even in smaller towns
It's pretty common to pop into a bakery for a slice of pizza or something, and eat it on your way to somewhere else, or while waiting for public transport
Sure but I don't think anyone is arguing that eating while walking is better than eating while seated
What I'm saying is that it is hardly considered rude (at least in Budapest and nearby towns) since everybody does it
I think most people pay so little attention they wouldn't even notice you eating, let alone thinking about what sort of a life you have
It has to be a foreign author though
In Hungarian we hyphenate them after every third digit above 2000
So 24768 becomes huszonnégyezer-hétszázhatvannyolc
Still ridiculously long but a bit easier to read
Évszámként láthattad egybeírva, valami oknál fogva ott nem érvényes az általános szabály (mondjuk hülyén is nézne ki)
Ha nem évszámról volt szó, akkor csak rosszul írta az illető, de nagyobb hibát sose vétsen
(If you saw the numbers referring to the years 2019 and 2020 that's possible because dates are exempt from the general rule - don't ask me why, my best guess is they'd look stupid hyphenated
Otherwise it's incorrect without a hyphen but as long as that's the biggest mistake someone makes i envy them)
Hát szerintem igen, de miért tennéd ki magad ilyen kínoknak
Amúgy szerintem az történhetett, hogy ezerkilencszázvalamikor összeültek az okosok, és kitalálták, hogy kétezertől kötőjelezünk (de akkor se mindig)
Aztán jött az ezredforduló, és nem volt ember, aki azt írta volna, hogy kétezer-egy, ezért bekerült a kivétel a szabályok közé. Gyanítom, arra nem gondoltak, hogy lelkes nyelvtanulók rögtön kiszúrják a sok baromságot
Amúgy hivatalosan mindig számmal kell írni a keltezést, úgyhogy nagyon ne agyalj ezen :D
(Yes, i'd think so but why would you subject yourself to such pain
Imho what happened is some dudes sat down in nineteensomething and decided that everything after 2000 will be hyphenated [but not always]
Then the millenium came and no one would write 'twothousand-one' so they made the exeption
Probably didn't think enthusiastic language learners would jump on the chance to dissect stupid grammar rules
But since officially dates are supposed to be written in numbers i wouldn't kill my braincells over this)
There was a large military barrack/base in my hometown, ever since at least before ww2, because there's a very central train station here
Then the nazis used it as a collecting camp for transport during the Holocaust, then the soviets took it and used it as their base until about 1989
I think part of it is still used as a much smaller army base, the rest is left to rot
Ferenc Liszt
Gypsy Music maybe
The first few that come to my mind are Ivan and the Parazol and Paddy and the Rats, the two bands that constantly have concerts abroad with a lot of fans, people seem to love them everywhere
And there's probably some more, that are more famous, that I fail to remember to
So no one's gonna mention Die Woodys

Srdcí is a way to beautiful sounding word for "heart".

Let me give an answer with a specific example
There is always a security guard right beside the entrance of media markt
If we make eye contact accidentally they will say hi or if they don't right away then I will because it's just awkward if none of us does
But there are occasions when they look at me but I don't look back or the other way around and then there are also when none of us acknowledges the other
I always say hi when I get on a bus but it's not common at all to say thank you when you get off because you would basically need to shout across the entire bus so the driver can hear you and they are probably busy greeting and selling tickets to the people who gets on at the stop you get off so it just makes no logical sense
I don't talk to shop assistants if I don't need help because they are busy most of the time and why would I anyway
Cashiers greet you and you greet them back but in supermarkets for example it's not uncommon to not do that either sometimes
Talking to complete strangers on the street for no reason sounds a very foreign concept to me
On buses - usually not, unless you are showing your ticket to the bus driver or buying it from him/her
Saying thank you to the bus driver - maybe if you bought your ticket from him/her
As a general rule - we don't greet unknown people we don't want to start an interaction with
(The only exception I can think of is greeting the shopkeeper in small stores
(The situation might be different in the countryside, though
It's pretty much the same in Hungary
Depends also on the size of the town/settlement, the smaller it is, the greater the chance for people being friendly - among themselves, not necessarily with aliens/outsiders
Small talk is practically non-existant in bigger towns/cities with population over I word say 1-200,000
Hungary has a rich history in animation, we had a [world class studio] but died in the 2000's.
The most famous TV series is the [Hungarian Folk Tales] it had many episodes (it was in production from 1977 to 2011) so basically it is an inter-generation experience
[Mézga család] was popular in the 70's, [Pom Pom] in the 80's.
For TV movies my fav is [Vuk] but [Macskafogó] [Vili a veréb] [Szaffi] [Ludas Matyi] and many other are part of the Hungarian collective culture
Here is a super detailed list about the Hungarian animation industry:  [
[Cat city (Macskafogó)]
Macskafogó. It's something every Hungarian has heard about
The best animated film Hungary has ever produced imo
The Czechs have given my family so much
Pat a Mat is my childhood
I remember hearing that the Flintstones were funnier in Hungarian than in English so they came to translate it back to English to see what the Hungarians were saying
Golden Life - Aranyelet - was a good series from a few years ago that played on HBO around the world
wow, that's super cool, I didn't know they translated episodes to other languages
Tfw Beard loicense but german
I bet Germany, Portugal and especially France has peepee in their pampers
Edit: looking forward for the matches tho, and I don't think our boys will let the bigger teams win
They will put up a fight
They are expected to embarrass themselfes
But what would they care, with all that money
I mean, you really can't do worse than us
Sallai's, Szoboszlai's and Szalai's name makes not only the journalist who has to write about our matches but also these western """""defenders""""" crumble

Check out QI if you haven't yet
When I first heard Croatians look at Jelacic as a national hero I was really suprised, because he is hated in Hungary and considered a traitor for his involvement in the 1848-1849 Hungarian Revolution
In hindsight it makes a lot of sense, but in Hungary we learn about him in such a negative way, so I never thought someone could look at him differently
I would say Avram Iancu
He is a national hero in Romania but for Hungary is a negative figure because he was working with the Habsburgs in the revolution of 1848
It's a shame that they(hungarian leaders) couldn't accept that there were a lot of minorities in the country, I think that the revolution could have been succesful if they would have went for a multi ethnic hungary
But in the end the minorities were promised more rights and stuff in exchange for their help, but in the end they did not get anything either as far as I know  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
> In hindsight it makes a lot of sense
Honestly it doesn't. If I was a Croat I would despise the guy as he did nothing but harm Croatia
Yeah, around Central Europe ethnic cleansing is often seen as something to be celebrated
How can you be surprised by that
:) He was a ruthless reactionary neoabsolutist
Metternich isnt that big of a national villain for us imo, Haynau and Bach are though
I don’t think most people know who Khuen-Héderváry is in Hungary
And Kossuth’s role as a national hero is becoming reevaluated, many consider him overrated and an ambivalent or even negative figure
Kossuth's later observations and forecasts regarding Croatia's fate are rather astute
Too bad he was just a bit unfit to wield power
He isn't unanimously regarded as _the_ national hero of his era
It is known as the Western Front (Turkish: Kurtuluş Savaşı, Batı Cephesi, Ottoman Turkish: Garb Cebhesi گرب جابهاسی‎)[23] of the Turkish War of Independence in Turkey and the Asia Minor Campaign (Greek: Μικρασιατική Εκστρατεία) or the Asia Minor Catastrophe (Greek: Μικρασιατική Καταστροφή) in Greece
We still kind of still thunderously despise him but it was his administration under which many of the laws and decrees were enacted that helped modernise the country
It's a bit like Kádár around these parts: it's hard to forget and forgive how his reign started, regardless of the positives of subsequent decades
Not under his administration, but despite imo
In an 1862 article, published in Milan under the title 'Clarifications to the Proposal of the Danube Confederation' (*Fölvilágosítások a Dunai Konföderáció Projektumához, in:L'Alleanza, 1st June 1862)* he did accept the right of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia to secede, but warned that should the South Slavic nations be liberated from under the Ottoman Empire and form a unified state, it would necessarily have Serbia as its centre and '*\[edit:Croatia\]* could not count on the assimilation of the remaining components of that State, but would in danger of its own national identity to be absorbed' ('*nemhogy ő számíthatna a többi komponens részek asszimilációjára, hanem ő volna annak kitéve, hogy nemzeti individualitása abszorbeáltatik*')
(He proposed that the three kingdoms should remain with the Kingdom of Hungary in the frame of the proposed Danube Confederation
&#x200B;
I'm pretty sure that *some* of the antipathy towards him stems from, ahem, later events that have occurred in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary
He was probably the last Hungarian politician who seriously considered a compromise with the Slavic and Romanian ethnicities rather than with the Habsburgs
Nope, absolutely under him and on his and the king's command
You must be thinking about the passive resistance movement, but they didn't do anything politically becauss the point of it all was not to do anything at all
The thing is, when Kossuth had the chance to actually make a difference, he stuck to his guns about a fully Hungarian (language wise) administration
Széchenyi even warned him that it was a bad idea but to no avail (to be fair, he was pretty much alone with that view)
What kind of passive resistance are you talking about in the Reform Era
Yes, he was a great kibitz and a less than stellar player
Business as usual
What
I wasn't.
Then what were you talking about
'Cause I was talking about Metternich
I'm not afraid of losing the Hungarian language, it survived multiple centuries of literal foreign occupation
However, I wish we used less English loanwords
We somehow kept our language for a millenium despite it never being the official language of Hungary until the 19th century and the fact that we are sandwiched between Slavs
I'm positive Hungarian is here to stay
Plus Hungarians are fucking terrible at learning English, so there is that as well
However, I am a tad bit worried about the regions where Hungarians are the minority and not many linguistic rights are in place
And I'm really devastated by the reality that in the future, not far from now Khanty and Mansi will disappear
(Those languages are the closest relatives of Hungarian)
As a Hungarian I’m not worried about it’s disappearance, but my grammar in Hungarian has deteriorated greatly as I don’t really write in Hungarian (at work I have to use English) - though I’m mostly talking about grammatical nuances, such as how to spell certain things etc
I think Dutch is especially hard hit by this, considering how incredibly similar it is to English
I mean when I first saw a Dutch script, I was shocked to see how much I could understand despite never having learnt Dutch
Exactly
Having a vast majority of languages is one of the things I cherish in this dystopian world
The mid/late 19th century
It would be awesome to live in Austro-Hungarian Empire
1867-1914
That was Hungary's finest hour
2077, to see the fuckin' chicken breast ads on the skyscrapers
Well, you can't really top Hungarian movie title translators, we have some  wondeful gems, like
In Bruges - Erőszakik which basically means 'Dumb violent men' so there's that
Simply fabulous
Altough I must say every fictional word that was translated to Hungarian from the Harry Potter movie works wonders, easier for the smaller viewers and gives an overall better feeling about the whole movie
Slytherin is Mardekár
Hogwarts is Roxfort
Mixed feelings I would say
3 full stores and one for online orders only
3 and all around the capital
3 in Hungary
You really shouldn't be surprised, it's a demographic you never really had contact with over your history
Using the N word in Hungary for example carries about as much weight as offending leprechauns
Most people know that it'd be inappropriate in person, but unless you live in the most busy, inner districts of Budapest you may live your whole life without seeing a black person anywhere other than movies, so of course people aren't too concerned about what words they use in private
Then there are some who genuinely don't even realize that it's offensive because they never got into trouble for it
>  "gypsy" (or rather, the German equivalent)
Everyime it comes up, my mother says "Oh, my grandmother used to chase them from our property, screaming as loud as she could
" ... Thanks, Mum
She then tries to justify it by saying that that part of her family is Hungarian
Oh here she'd fit in just right
In hungary, they try to sell this central-european narrative, to say that we are better than other eastern-european countries
TBH culturally we are pretty eastern-european
despite the governments countless efforts to make people believe we'll once belong to western europe and we'll catch up with austria
historically and as for now (and for some more time) there's no doubt that we belong the the centre, post-soviet area
definitely western
idk i guess it's not just about geography but culture, economy and how developed the country is
Why would uneducated guesses matter
Yet I don't think most people know anything about the Baltics or their current political status and their culture
yes, and it's getting less and less accurate and getting outdated, if it isn't already
people refer to us as Eastern Europe because of the cold war, but that was a while ago
This is just my opinion living here in Hungary, not a fact tho, but I assume I know more of our situation than someone from Norway
Same for any country, I have no idea how people live in Norway or the Baltics
Not to mention I don't like to be grouped with Ukraine or Belarus or even the Nordics or Baltics because I don't see the point
Yes, I'm gonna rewrite history by pointing out that a high percentage of words in the Hungarian language are literal translations from German, and we borrowed a lot cultural heritages from A-H. /s
I absolutely think it has everything to do with economical,  political and cultural situations in those countries
I'm not saying I get offended when someone calls us Eastern European, but the case is not as clear cut as you make it out to be
After all if 100 year passes, will the cold war still be relevant at all
He was elected democratically
He isn't really a dictator
If you believe that, it's pointless to talk to you
Do you know the situation in Belarus
I never said we were perfect however
Yes, for I am not a barn animal
Cholent is very popular with tourists in Budapest
It's a traditional Jewish food, Hungarian Jews had their own version of it
Most of the ingredients are cheap as Jews often couldn't afford expensive things but even the rich Jewish families ate/eat it
We also have butcher shops which sell combos like a sausage or blood sausage+slice of bread+ pickled something and you can eat it standing in the window
These places are very popular with working class people and the nicer ones in good locations with tourists
I regularly buy Currywurst at the Innotrans convention in Berlin for like 10 or 12 euro
Poor people's food
Not so much
This is my luxury
Even when I can buy every genuine ingredient at the Lidl store 5 minutes away from my house, and I regularly prepare it
Don't forget stuff like Lángos (aka
hungarian pizza with the fruits of the cow), and the various kinds of főzelék (best way to describe is probably vegetable soup, or a REALLY thick vegetable soup, that is used to be eaten with bread)
Those can be made from stuff that costs very little
Yeah, I definitely should've added lángos
I'm not sure about főzelék, it is a poor people food but it isn't really popular with tourists
"hungarian pizza with the fruits of the cow"
Kőhalmi ftw
McDonald's at Nyugati station, Budapest: [interior] and [exterior]
Also maybe a [Starbucks] on the Danube Promenade, in the Hotel Marriott
Edit: a bit later the local KFC in my hometown (Nyíregyháza) came to my mind
It opened in a building of a previous car dealership, that's why it has unique [exterior] and an interesting, scpacious [interior] with high ceiling and a little [dome]
Probably McDonald's at Nyugati railway station
They did a great job renovating the place to its original shine, other parts of the building (designed by Eiffel's company) are rather depressing
It seems to fit well in the station, nice
The building of the Nyugati McDonald's used to be a high class restaurant from a time period when travelling by train was considered gentleman-like

There's a chauvinistic pop song called _Nélküled_ ("Without You" - unfortunately nothing to do with Mariah Carey - more like with the Bulgarian counterpart with Ken Lee)
"Patriotic rock" is an existing genre in Hungary, and it's pretty rewarding for the musicians, because there is a stable big demand for it
Of course, it lacks of every artistic necessity
At best, they are kitchy songs about the beauty of Transylvania or the glorious past of Greater Hungary, at worst, their lyrics generate hatred towards neighbouring countries, Romani and Jewish people etc
But
This song became a signature song of the country
Among others, the fascist prime minister Viktor Orbán likes to promote this song, so it's very often played at various events
A new, gigantic football stadium was opened some weeks ago (as if we had a football scene with appreciable results), and this song was also played at the celebration
One journalist who made an account of the event wrote that he hadn't known this song at all, and didn't understand why people stood up like it was the national anthem, so he didn't.
It generated a HUGE controversy on the fascist half of our society
He was called a traitor of the nation, billboards were put out about his (presumed) Jewish heritage etc etc
People acted as if he had desecrated the real national anthem, and not just a kitchy pop song from the early 2000s.
I think this is very emblematic for our country
:(((
_And did those feeeet in ancient tiiimes
I immediately hear Eric Idle singing this in the Matress Sketch while standing in the tea chest
Completely, and its delicious
However we slso have horse on the menu, which is seen as a curiosity butits also really nice, among other things we made some very fancy sausage out of it however it was too popular, and disappeared quiet fast
Deer(stew) and duck(breast meat) are pretty common, you find them in many restaurants
I don't see rabbit that often in restaurants but it isn't extreme
We rarely eat them
....despite the fact that the name should be a dead giveaway about its purpose
From where
I didn't know about it, but if it's going to be an 'adult' version, I might check it out
Last year I saw Piccolo Teatro's version and I was shocked how much substance there was to the story
It was an unexpected highlight for sure
Without being bit once
I get bit at like six different places every evening, and I'm not even outdoors, and use this anti-mosquito plugin thingy after dark
Here Na=nátrium, K=kálium
There are a few differences, mainly C=szén, S=kén, and heavy metals
For a good while latin was the official language here, when hungarian was officialised some people tried making new names, but they never stuck
Some do, some don't:
Vas (Fe),
Szén (C),
Réz (Cu)
Alumínium (Al),
Hidrogén (H),
Berillium (Be)
Etc
Until the late 19th century, most elements had a pretty different name in Hungarian when compared to their "international" names
Before the 1840s, they had mostly had descriptive and unconventional names (e.g. Hydrogen was called water mother (vízanya), water object (víztárgy) or water alcohol (víz-szesz) among others)
In 1842 (I think), they set up a convention for these names, intentionally trying to be different from other languages to protest the Habsburgs and strengthen the Hungarian national identity
It was quite controversial, receiving praise for its uniqueness and hate for potentially isolating Hungarian scientists from Western European ones
This unique naming scheme died away in the 2nd half of the 19th century, then it had a short reneissance in the 1870s, and then they decided to set up today's naming scheme
Here are some elements, listed in the form of *English name:* *1842 overhaul name* \- *Modern name*
Oxigen: Éleny - Oxigén
Sodium: Szikeny - Nátrium
Hydrogen: Köneny - Hidrogén
Calcium: Mészeny - Kalcium
Titanium: Kemeny - Titán
Silver: Ezüstany - Ezüst
We also have:
* Ag: ezüst
* Au: arany (might be related to the latin name)
* Sn: ón
* Sb: antimon
* Pb: ólom
* Cu: réz
* Fe: vas
There are also some others that are spelled differently, but pronounced more or less the same as the Latin name (e.g. k instead of c, f instead of ph etc
My favourite is *higany* for mercury which accidentally seems to match with its symbol (Hg)
The Latin name is hydrargyrum (liquid silver)
The Hungarian name comes from "híg anyag" (liquid matter)
Interesting coincidence, for sure

Artisan hamburgers became very widespread in the last decade
Arab kebab shops and Greek gyros shops are very prominent and integral part of a night out
Authentic pizza is also very well liked
Chinese buffets are literally everywhere, Hungary has the largest Chinese diaspora in Eastern Europe
Indeed
But the only orthodox topping besides garlic water is sour cream and cheese
I'm glad you like it
Btw, lángos is singular, it means something like "flamey", because they used to bake it in an oven as a byproduct of bread (it was ready earlier than a larger loaf of bread); nowadays they fry it in oil
Wow
_Édes-nemes_ means "sweet-noble", _erős_ means "hot" ("strong" literally)
Where is your shop located
Wow
My knowledge about Maine is mostly based on the books of Stephen King, but it seems a really cool place, and I wish to go there once
Yeah, baked goods with poppy seeds are really good
That is correct, in Hungarian the letter "s" is always _sh_. What you prounce as _s_ is written as "sz" in Hungarian (so if you know Polish, inversely to their practice)
"Rózsa" means rose (no kidding), "félédes" means demi-sweet
Every other line from the Tragedy of Man
For example:
"The machine is in motion, the creator rests"
"Fight, trust and be full of hope
The beginning of the National Song:
"On your feet now Hungarian
The ones that come to mind
all the food is really spicy or greasy where i live
it's just
really unpleasant
Hungarian pessimism is just straight-up fucking infuriating, and our culture is simply soaked with it
That we feel so special about ourselves in every topic
Like everything we have: nature, culture, food, anything is only found in Hungary
There are so many myths about this, because most people don't speak languages, don't really care about other cultures
"There's no lake like Balaton anywhere else
There's no food like goulash anywhere else
Our language is the hardest to learn to any foreigner
The best wine is Tokaji in the world
We have the most Nobel prize winners per capita
We have the most curse words compared to any other language
Well yeah
Balaton is a great place, but every fresh water lake with a beach is good
Goulash is a meat stew, there are hundreds of dishes which are similar; it's not a huge invention
Hungarian isn't that tough for others - if it makes sense at all to make a ranking in difficulty, Chinese and Japanese are always harder
Tokaji is a decent wine, but it's also not an exclusive invention to use the noble rot to make wine
How many Nobel prize winners are who actually lived in Hungary at the time when they got it
All the others were forced away or had to go abroad to be able to research decently
We don't have so much more curse words than the others
We just don't speak foreign languages so deeply that we also know the slang very well
Et cetera
We are not that special
Spice is nice, grease is not
That's universal
It probably has something to do with lack of money, no proper education, no future, dead end jobs, and that the infamous uicide song is Hungarian
It was on a hill next to other hills and a big ass rive
Edit to further elaborate:
The main terroitories of Grand Prince Taksony were in the inner-most and best lands in Hungary, todays Komárom-Esztergom, Pest and Tolna counties
During his son Géza's reign begun the westernisation of Hungary and Esztergom became his and with that the church's seat of power
**The seat of the king moved between Esztergom and Székesfehérvár**, the first was a sacred site the latter was the seat of the yearly "országgyűlés" (the gathering of the nation) and was the traditional burying site of kings
Things changed after the first Mongol Invasion of Hungary, the king at the time made it mandatory for the nobles to build stone castles, becouse the country lacked them
He also moved his seat from Székesfehérvár to **Buda** in 1256
The traditional capital of Hungary was from now on in Buda, but the offical capital was often moved
The Anjous and Sigismund von Luxemburg had their capital in Visegrad, but Buda didn't lost prominance
It was still the second largest castle, was a free kingly city and (plot twist) the seat of the 'országgyűlés' was moved to a smaller city on the other side of the Danube called **Pest**. (Oh yeah, it's all coming together)
During the three Hungary's time the Habsburgs moved the capital and the országgyűlés to **Pozsony** (Bratislava) for two reasons: It was near to Wien so the communication between the Emperor and the országgyűlés could be fast and Buda was counqered by the turks in 1541
The capital of the shortly lived Eastern Hungarian Kingdom was in Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia), aftern the death of the last Szapolyai king the EHK transformed to the Principalty of Transylvania
The things started to get back to normal after the coalition of the cristians in 1683
The Habsburg led coalition recounqered most of Hungary and took in Buda too
Pozsony remained the capital until 1783 (according to en
wikipedia I didn't find anything about it) and the seat of the országgyűlés until 1848
It was a big deal for hungarian nationalism as the traditional seat was Pest and was one of the main demand of the March 15 revolution
Since 1783 the capital city is Buda and later Budapest
Only twice was the seat of power moved
Both times to Debrecen in 1848 and later in 1944
Esztergom, Székesfehérvár, and Visegrád were the first few capitals, all relatively close to Buda
Buda had fortresses since at least the 11th century, it's in a great position for a city: on a hill, beside a large river, at the edge of two different geographical regions
Sidenote, the [list of historical capitals] is pretty wild
Both Bratislava and Wien were capitals of Hungary before
when you wrote L. Napoleon I started to think about the 47 Napoleons I don't know shit about
wow I tought Zagreb always was the capital
:( We don't learn musch Croatian history in school
Great summary
I'll add that in the 1780's the "capital" moved from Pozsony to Buda for two reasons: The new royal palace (the one that exists to this day) was built by Queen Maria Theresa, and the administrative reform of the Habsburg Empire (so including the Kdm
of Hungary) by Her son, King Joseph II meant that the Hungarian government (Helytartótanács) moved to the old-new royal capital
The parliament (országgyűlés) remained in Pozsony because its job was to function as a representative of the Kingdom to its King (so it needed to be close to the court, which remained in Vienna), whereas the government's job was to act as a representative of the King to His Kingdom
Here the emphasis was on Hungary, so being in the traditional capital, and most importantly in the middle of the Carpathian Basin
Parliament moved to Pest when tradition and constitutionalism (now being by the people, for the people) meant more than distance to the King and the court
Also, railways making distance less important
What kind of Austro-Hungarians existed in the 13th and 15th century
There were intermarriages for sure, but I think do you talk about the kingdom of Hungary
St Petersburg was the capital of the Tsar and the home of the aristocratie, the bolsheviks couldn't have the capital of the old regime, becouse then it would be clear russians aren't liberated but under new managment
Moscow was the home of the past glory and was more central (well if you consider only european russia)
We learn about things what are important to Hungary, but other than that we know there was the croatian bán and thats all
"leszarom" - I shit on it (what you have to say)
but to be honest the phrase that translates to "I don't care", "Nem érdekel engem" is literally "It doesn't interest me/isn't interesting to me" with "engem" - "to me" regularly left out
"Leszarom", literally means "I shit it/ I shit on it"
In Hungary we use plenty of these
Ki nem szarja le
/Who isn't shit on it
Baszok rá./I fuck on it
A faszomat érdekli
/My dick is interested
(i can't explain it properly unfortunately
Szarok rá/Leszarom/I shit on it
Basszák meg a kurva anyjukat vele/Fuck their whore mother with it
Kit érdekel/Who cares
Nem érdekel/I don't care
Nagyon nem érdekel
/I really don't care
We can ask "Most hova szarjak
" which literally translates to "Where should I shit now
"Ki nem szarja le
Akinek nincs segge
"Who doesn't shit on it
Whoever doesn't have an arse
But
but what about ,, Ki nem szarja le"(who doesnt shit on it) and ,,Ki a faszt érdekel"(who is the dick who interested in it)
Also: "Nekem nyolc
" - "It's eight for me
It can mean "I don't care" or "It's good to me either way". Or something along these line
How about “Hova szarjak
”, means where should I take a shit, implies I dont care
"Ki a faszt érdekel" should be "Who the fuck cares"
It is considered rude to clink with beer in Hungary due to the fact that the Austrians clinked with beer to celebrate when they crushed the Hungarian war for freedom of 1848/49
After that Hungarians swore not to clink with beer for 150 years
When the 150 elapsed it just kinda stuck to us not to clink with beer
Back to the future between Christmas and new year's eve
We usually joke about London being the second largest Hungarian city since there are more Hungarians living there than our actual second largest city
*distant Hungarian screaming*
Well in some circles they clink and shout "Fuck you Haynau
" which seems just as appropriate
Yeah only to beer
However if you are not Hungarian we don't mind, you won't be considered rude
Most Hungarians don't give a fuck about it these days
At least in my experience
We just get the beer say cheers and start drinking it
At least that's what my friends and I do and what I see people doing
If you really hate someone you can pound your bottle on top of theirs lol
Same in Hungary
A few years ago the channel that tends to air it dropped it to provide better entertainment, and got like 10% of the country petitioning to get it back
Since then as the christmas season  starts to close in the place an ad for home alone where a sad voice reads up "There is no christmas without Kevin
" to clips from home alone
Well I'd probably let it slide as I think most Hungarians would
Fuck
I almost had them and now you ruined my plan
Absolutely loved it as a tourist, but probably couldn't live there
Never been there but definietly on my bucket list
My friends, a married couple moved to there, because the husband got a good job offer there
The wife was at home with their little son
They didn't even stay one year - it was such a dull place to live that they soon seeked another job in Belgium

The difference between W and V is mind boggling to me
For example, when you say, 'What', you basically have to say 'Uvat' but the U is like a tenth in length of the already pretty short U sound

Translation to conventional english:
Hungarian language can be defined with one phrase: we pronounce words as we write them
We have much more letters than English including  double letters and a triple one
A quick pronunciation guide:
Cs - chunk
Dz - (just say d and z in a rapid succession)
Dzs - jumper
Gy - (tricky, it should be written dj) during
J - I, but without the vowel
Ly - basically the same
Ny - ñ
S - sh
Sz - s
Ty - tune
Zs - (the french j)
Dézolé, zsö nö párlö pá franszé
There is that fancy handwriting-like font (that I can't be bothered to look up) which would be a perfect fit for southern English

I'm not sure the Middle East is a good comparison but, yes, most Western countries are massive hypocrites in this sense
All of them love to talk about freedom, the principle of self-determination, etc
but only when it helps them or at least doesn't hurt them
That's why they were fine with the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the USSR or Yugoslavia but used their military to fight independence movements in their own colonial empires and to oppress independence movements back home
So, I guess the answer is because everyone deserves freedom and self-determination*.
*as long as they live somewhere else and their freedom and self-determination doesn't raise questions in my country
I'm not sure what your point is
That it's "all in the past"?
Kosovo is a pretty recent example of this hypocrisy
It declared independence from Serbia in 2008
This decision wasn't supported by the Serbian minority but in this case most Western countries didn't care about the lack of universal support for the declaration of independence and still accepted it
So, yeah
I think Western states should either shut up about freedom, self-determination, rights etc
or accept it that these principles sometimes work against them
I'm absolutely for the freedom and self-determination of people and I think it should apply to everyone
Kosovans just as much as Catalans, Kurds or Basques
Franco oppressed Catalans and Basques and Western countries still weren’t lining up to support their independence
Western countries literally don’t care about war crimes or oppression as long as it’s not in their interest
Think about what happened to the high-ranking Serb, Croatian, etc
soldiers who were accused of war crimes: they landed in front of the ICTY
I guess that’s great, we don’t want war criminals running around, right
Now, have you ever seen any Western soldier appear in front of an international court because of a war crime
Nope
It’s not in their interest
....and
It wasn't meant to be an example of modern-day Western hypocrisy
Colonial wars and the dissolution of the USSR and Yugoslavia just show that Western states had the very same mentality for decades so their behavior in Catalonia's case isn't something new or unique and it won't change in the future
1) Read my other comments, I already stated that I support Kosovo’s independence
2) I don’t know how Croatia works but the Hungarian government doesn’t ask every single citizen what they think about the government’s decisions in international politics
So, yeah, even though I agree with it, their decision had nothing to do with me
Well we have this called thing called “kicsinyítő képző” and it makes every name into a nickname for example:
-Barnabás —> Barnabáska
-Szabolcs —> Szabolcska
But almost every name has a nickname version so and they sound better with the previous kicsinyítő képző:
-Barnabás —> Barnus, Barni, Barna —> Barnuska,
Barnika (you don’t use it with Barna for some reason)
-Szabolcs —> Szabi —> Szabika
We have "-i", which is basically the same as the English "ee" mentioned in the OP, but we also have "-ka"/"-ke", which most probably came from Slavic
Oh köszi
Im not from there but i guess if you are rich is great and if you are poor it sucks
Just like in every other country
I think Bald and bankrupt had a video in Abkhazia
Good riddance
I'm cool with that

Messenger and Instagram will be missed not-so-dearly, the rest can rot in hell, for all I care
Now is it just facebook or every other app that is being part of facebook like instagram or whatsapp
Facebook-side:
If Facebook leaves, they lose money
If stays earns a little less money until now
EU-side:
If Facebook leaves, nothing happens
If stays, EU earn a little more money until now
I don't really see why (apart from lobby, of course) should the EU back out
There are literally hundreds of other chat platforms
Oh having three chat programs on my phone
The horror
What a problem
Btw, I don't use whatsapp whatsoever
Well, I guess without Whatsapp Europe is crippled we have no choice but to bend over and let facebook fuck us
Love him or hate him, but at this point, a world leader who is reasonable and at least resembles a human being is far beyond the average
Not saying there is no room to improve, or I support him or anything, but it's refreshing hearing some common sense from someone in a powerful position
I love the fact he was not reading it from a paper at all and yet it is a well formulated and explained speech
I can believe those are his thoughts and believes
Nice, but people who don't understand this won't understand telling them anyways
They understand only actions and force
I like what Macron says here
Now start implementing it and those who do not respect it must be removed form our society
Nagyon igaz
I deeply agree with this
If we van one thing, we'll have to ban the next accordingly and so on until no expression is allowed
I support this point of view, and it takes balls to stand by this opinion after all the shit that keeps happening in France
You can tell he takes his job seriously and he has love for his country and the people and culture in it
I wish eastern Europe had politicians like him
Because it's not about supporting him or not in general, it's about what he says about a specific problem, and how he says it
Also, because I'm not familiar with his policies in-depth and unlike most people, I don't like to form opinions on important things, like political ideologies without actual research and understanding
I realize it's not representative but most people I know dislike the way it sounds
In fact, the people I know who actually like the way French sounds are people who learned it (including me)
I assume it also depends greatly on your native language, maybe Romance speakers will like it more, dunno
...maybe when somebody tries to calm everyone down after ideologically motivated members of a minority commit attrocities, we shouldn't attack said person for it
If for nothing else, then to not make ourselves look like utter morons

(Remember WWI
That guy who was assassinated by serbs, was the one who supported them the most in the Austro-hungarian empire
Attacking your own support base is not going to send the messenge you wanted
Interesting
I also match your observations about Hungarians haha for me Italian sounds the most beautiful
E al diavolo con i cechi lol
>conclusion is wrong due to it being based on racism, or if you believe that they are arguing in bad faith to promote xenophobia
Both of these will invalidate the argument being made, and must be pointed out no matter what "side" you're on
...so every conclusion that involves race, is automatically wrong
no matter what

As for Budapest, well it's a very polarized city
Some parts are absolutely beautiful, with views you cannot grow tired of, but sadly it only takes looking 1-2 streets away to find shitty, almost slummy parts of town
In general though, I'm not complaining, for a big city it's not a bad one at all
Man I love how wholesome this sub is

Let's just fill in the underpasses instead of cleaning them once in a blue moon, that will be so much better
Yay for standing at the red light for 3 minutes
Unpopular opinion: underpasses are cool
It's the illusion of crowd
If ten people are standing at a red light, than that ten people will look like a lot of people and for a fairly long time
Meanwhile fifty people crossed down into the underpass in that three minutes, but that is like one person every three seconds, that is not even a busy underpass
People choose standing at the light if they can't take the steps comfortably (their leg or feet hurts, or just plain lazy to take a few stairs), or they are on wheels for some reason (wheel chair, stroller, bike)
Having maintained underpasses do not take away the option for lights, both can be done at the same time
Underpasses save lives and are a more comfortable option than waiting for two or more lights in convoluted busy crossings

Shh, dont say something which makes sense
At this point, nobody has masks
China bought out the entire stock a month ago
It's like that everywhere in Europe
Money can't fix that
Other equipment and beds though, that you can buy
Yes, it's pretty good business right now
Face masks go for ten to thirty times the usual price, but we've been quoted for 300 times the usual price too
If anybody announces that there's going to be a state aid for face masks prices could go to 20 to 30 times the usual, or even higher

Considering every single damned politician i ever came into contact with be it small town mayors, some ministers, or just representatives of the students at an university

Every goddamn one would sell out his/her mother to the nazis for a little advancement in their career
The whole group is frankly disgusting
I would say not being involved in the whole travesty of representative democracy is an achievment in itself
As said representatives represent one thing only, their own intrests at the price of everyone else
Yeah
Who the hell cares what your represenatitve does or doesnt do, if she gives two flying fucks about your intrests
The main goal should be to have one vaguely in line with your social group, like age gender etc
Or maybe not
Maybe finding a leader for a country is not the same things as being a rabid fan of the local football club

While I've lived with both options (UK / HU), I think private property doors opening inwards is a better option
If you're opening the door and there's someone who you don't want to let in, you can easily push your body weight against the door, and close the door again
(or use your feet to block the door from opening further)
If the door opens outwards, it's a fair playing field to the would be intruder
(both sides have to pull on the handle)
Also, if someone wants to keep you in, they can push against the door and prevent you from opening the door
The only downside is easy of access around leaving
However, it's worth noting that most properties that have inwards opening doors, also have a corridor in the front with plenty of empty space to open the door
This can be done in one round, everyone just has to mark two options
One they prefer, a second one that they would prefer from the other two, or mark one they absolutely don't want

As a hungarian, it's insulting to no be at least among the worrying ones
Hungary is definitely not OK results
We're almost always average or below average
What happened to Hungary's borders
Hungary should be in orange
Greece should be OK or average
Maybe this is a difference in the usage of terms, but I would call making yourself ruling by decree indefinitely because of COVID-19, and with this one of your first passing laws is the delegitimization of trans people "worrying".

Here in Hungary I pulled out my summer running gear for the weekend because it was t-shirt and shorts time
The whole 'winter' I don't think I've seen less than -5°C.
... but fortunately there is no climatechange
Gonna love the 30C at midnight in my no AC room summer again :(
No matter how many times you guys cry about the weather
It won't change
We're more likely to tackle this issue but at the end of this decade
Until then
it's childish to act like its the end of the world
Don't get gloomy and obsessed over things you can't control
Your lifestyle doesn't help this issue
Last year's February was pretty cold, now It's a lot  warmen and but still there were days when it was warmer in Antarctica than in Budapest
U mean for another 2 weeks
So extreme weather all around the globe, showing that every place is facing crazy climate change
Not reassuring by any means

TAIWAN NUMBER ONE
Yesterday hungarys ruling party passed the ‘slave law’ which enables companies to make their workers work extra 400 hours
The overtime ony has to be paid after three years
Protesters confronted the authorities in the whole city, the police used gas and pepper spray several times
One more reason to get the hell out of this country after I finish uni
The law wasn’t even passed in accordance with Parliamentary rules
So technically the law is void
Now the next question is whether or not the opposition and the Hungarian people are going to rebel
During the vote for this the entire opposition tried to make it impossible to make the vote happen
They closed down the doors of the parliament and played sirens so Fidesz can't vote
Now let's see how this plays out, since as a Hungarian I truly believe we have a chance to finally, FINALLY, overthrow this shit government
English article about the law if anyone interested:
A little backstory
All our workers were sucked up by western europe
No one left in the country to work
It is just a modification of an wxisting law, they raised voluntary overtime from 250 to 400 hours
I sure love living here
Unfortunately, they probably won't
Acab dude
They are spiritless sheeps
All they do is attacking protesters who are alone
You should have seen their faces when the mass broke through their lines
you guys already have a shitload and will continue to get more of us (source: i will move out when i graduate too)
Actually u dont want to
The taxes are insane here
But not a bad idea tbh
Thanks brother ️
Fascists can really make people go totally blind
All you need is an imaginery enemy
Hate is actually really powerfull
Also fidesz manipulated the voting system by redrawing the borders of voting districts and they  developed their own program for counting votes
Sounds suspicious
Jobbik is currently part of the opposition
Let that sink in
They implemented a system called winner compensation
If you don't vote for the currently elected person or the second most popular canditate the vote automaticly goes to the currently elected person
This way they managed to get the 2/3 in the parliment with less then the 50% of actual votes
Hungary has low unemplyoment rate on paper
A lot of people do "public works" (according to google thats what it is called in English which is basically you are employed by the government to clean streets, parks, etc
It looks good on paper but barely pays and you can't live off of it
The problem is the other way around
There are serious workforce shortages in some sectors
The law slightly improves the situation for the time being
Ultimately though, it will encourage more people to work abroad instead
I didn't know Poland had any communists left
Well, its not a question o getting guilottined
If you think about it we are far past "crossing the rubicon", i would say the current regime passed it, when it decided to create a fresh tax to build footbal stadions to support the president's hobby, or when it decided that we needed to build a local trainnetwork around his home village, that is just sitting there doing nothing
Now we have the past neighbour and close friend of our prime minister achieving better growth rates in his ventures then when facebook vent public
If we want to be honest, its either create a soft dictatorship, with rule of "law", aka
changing the constitution on whim to suit you, or the possibility of spending decades in jail, as best option, and mobs hanging people from lamp post as worst
So its the damned if you do damned if you don't situation
In the sense that there is no going back
We will see
People here are not quite active
Yesterday was a good start but I dont know if it will last for more than one day
It won't, they control everything, election is just a play for funsies
He will be ruling until he dies, either natural cause or people hanging them from the Chain bridge
Well they passed it illegally, violating the parliamentary rules
Therefore the law is invalid
Yeah, escalating shit to public slaughter solves everything
###♫ OOOH SAY CAN YOU SEEEE
It has nothing to do with migrants
We dont have any problem with working, we have problem with working for free mostly for foreign companies
Also people ho were on the streets yesterday are generally supporting the idea of the quota system
Little funfact for you; hungary took in all the migrants that we were requited by the quota system, it is just not public so they can keep up their “fight against migrants and Gyorgy Soros” cause it helps them keep people on their side
I hope you see things a bit clearer now my friend
Imagine re founding companies every 2,5 years and hireing everyone again so they wont have to pay at the end of 3 years
Good days ahead
I dont think there is  a good option at the monent
Btw the labor law is just a rubber bone for the media and the massses
It allows passing laws to centralize the judicial system, and put it under direct political control
Which is the main goal, the labor law is as important as the "internet tax" was a few years ago
That guillotine thing that I keep hearing about sounds okay
Exactly
Yes they seem ok, but there are some concern that they are closer to Fidesz than it seems at first glance
They are too small tbh
Also there are some conflicts in the prty which is not great either
Average wage in Hungary is around €700 a month after tax
You can rent a small one bedroom flat in Budapest for around €300 plus utilities
Won't be a very nice one and certainly not in the city centre but still
And outside Budapest everything is a lot cheaper
You can't really live off just government assistance, it's simply not enough
Luckily this is totally false in every way
The only similarity that their leader looks like Orban 30 years ago (this is what most people say) :D
Ah i see
He's a man of culture as well
That wasnt work of real weebs
That was just some random idiot who watched pokemon and naruto, and googled up anime girl on the net
A weeb is a completely peaceful entity, only drawn 2D anime children should be afraid of them, but not the 3D ones
The weebs are fine with homosexual rights, transgenders, because they also love the ''traps'', or transgender anime characters
They can unite easily, in the attack on titan face and reddit group i usually chat with arabs, indians, vietnamese people, and not with other europeans
But there are signs of radicals also
But i see more communist content
Memes about the soviets, lenin, etc
There are half (or not only half) fascist (first of all in aot groups) also, but there's more far-leftists content
Google up r/animemes flag
You'll see communist and anarchist symbols
(Lel meanwhile i'm kinda liberal, not a nationalist, but not a big socialist either
Nope
Not all far right s the american flavour of nutjob, the christian KKK flavoured nutjob
And people like him, or our Orban, don't translate well abroad
They are just generic authoritarians, they don't lean heavily right or left
However ours LOVES to act in  way that whips up contraversy abroad - as attacks on him abroad low him to fashion himself as a revolutionary fighting the "big evil interantional whatever shadow power", and keep his revolutionary image he gained shortly after te end of comunism
No one said all weebs are this or that
But as you confirmed, there are radical weebs, one of whom made that poster
Also, no it is not just someone that saw pokemon or naruto when he was 10, the background anime girl is Rem from Re:Zero, a pretty recent and popular anime
Underrated video
This should be the first thing to pop up, before you log in to twitter
Also Hitler was socialist, but he was extreme cultural right
I know
But can you imagine her saying it
If they want someone from that show beatrice would be the  best choice
Not Rem
If i were them i'd choose cornelia li britannia from code geass
Or mari kurihara from prison school
Edit: lel i tought it was the guy from sweden, but its a fellow hungarian
What do U think, personally, that someone in hungary made something like that
Doesn't matter who they chose exactly
They made it purely for the keks
I'm pretty indifferent
It's a meme with obvious racist content, which is dangerous but the intent is probably not direct racism, but memeing
In that regard it's a distasteful one and luckily it got removed pretty fast
If I were a gypsy I would obviously be very hurt by it, but since I am not I can't pretend to be, and neither will or can I defend it
edit: Also, pointinh out that someone >in Hungary< made that, isn't a surprise
Hungary is generally very openly racist towards gypsies, and highly racist otherwise as well
Economic socialist, not cultural
The pre war economy was planned
Small buisnisses were limited and monopolies' power were decreased
Hmm
okay
Kinda agreed
(Meh your english is so much better than mine
XDXD)
:) Don't sweat it, yours is way better than how most Hungarians speak English
And I'm completely sure that in some years you'll speak it fluent as fuck
Mark my words
Well yes, not overall socialist
The parts of the economy were only changed, when Hitler tought it's wrong
Most of the neo nazis today are economic centrist
I pointed out, that I only talk about economy here
Economic leftism most of the time is associated with cultural leftism
Also why tf I'm getting downvoted
Yeah I know, that was a mistake from my part
I meant, that, if you are socialist then you are most likely progressive
But not always
This oddly looks like an Assassin's Creed map
A few months ago I saw this comment on r/ukpolitics and it sums up this situation pretty well:
>Well most modern Neo Nazis are also the kind of people the Nazis would put into camps or castrate for being a bit daft
Im not saying that these people are fucking stupid
but they are fucking stupid
It doesn't just insult Poland and Polish heroes and victims
It insults Nazis as well
Now that's a feat
roflmao
R/pics
didnt the Danish do this with pigs
yeap:
Which one is the new PM again
So long, and thanks for all the fish
You can suck my banker, globalist balls t_D.
*This comment was sponsored by the George Soros Foundation*
Thank you frenchies
So eu is a go
As a Hungarian, my sincere condolences to anyone who wants to take the train here
My dad used to think about the US as a country where civil rights are still a thing
He used to think that it is the one country that Europe can rely on once things here go to shit, because this was how my grandpa raised him during the communist occupation of Hungary
The US used to be basically a beacon of hope
Sad to see that his whole world view is crumbling
Stayed the same because I expected this sort of madhouse
Anyways, the statistics seems [hella distorted]
Poland explain yourself
Hmm, not sure which is the worse
All it did to me is solidify my suspicion that Trump is legit retarded
> He used to think that it is the one country that Europe can rely on
&#x200B;
>because this was how my grandpa raised him during the communist occupation of Hungary
...after 56, when NATO supported an imperialistic war along the suez canal, instead of a bona fide revolution in hungary
...that kind of ally was not different from the USSR at all
>but they were instrumental to Europe's safety during the cold war
If you mean that they created nuclear weapons first, thus France, UK, and the USSR copied from tehm, then sure, they created the nuclear peace
But only coincidentally - as they are very anti-proliferation
These are my thoughts exactly
In the end no country will make an effort that is not in their best interests
I find this sad as well
I think the WU holds great potential, but first the bureaucracy needs to be reduced
As for the moving part of your comment
I have learned to speak German and plan on learning to speak Swedish/Norwegian in the next three years to keep my options open
Wow, this is something else
So much wasted potential because these are really interesting surveys indeed
Fair enough
Well yes
However same is true about North Korea being warm and welcoming toward deserting US soldiers
Finally
Who is the next one
Wonder if we will need to wait for this long
I wish it could be the same case in Hungary
It's ridiculous what's happening there
Around Orban's, Meszaros' and the other guys
But as I know, it's also a trouble that who would be the next one after Fidesz
Cause i heard that the opposition parties are incompetent
viva la revolucion
Only 5 in russia
I thought there would be more
I absolutly adore how every time either Romania or Hungary gets mentioned somewhere, both of them instantly appear and play a verbal 1v1
We both should shut the fuck up already and live in peace lol
Our great-grandparents fought against each other, in communist times our grandparents and parents have been incited against each other, and now all of our living ancestors, great-grandparents, grandparents, parents AND the effin' governments are telling us to hate each other
How about we break this cycle, because we don't have a fucking reason to keep going
Let the boomers fight alone, if they want to (like they did in Uz valley a couple of months ago over a fucking graveyard)
Romanians are some crazy mofos when it comes to driving, when they get on our highways they drive like there’s no tomorrow, both trucks and cars
Nincs Románia
I don't care about the music, it is the cars they are driving on the highway from Germany to Romania
Here is a van that was driven home after an accident:
Another one on a trailer with a funny hookup solution:
A cargo Mercedes solution (it is a piano in the back):
Another cargo solution:
Another cargo solution (the Mercedes pulls a trailer van, which pulls another trailer):
Truck pulls trailer, trailer pulls audi, audi pulls another trailer:
I don't envy their guardian angels
I mean, we Hungarians had our fair share with fridges on the top of the trabants in the late 80's, but it was nowhere this bad
Well Romanians towing way too much with way too shitty trailers is a thing in Hungary now :D
Yes, with their diy trailers, at least in Hungary
\+pirosarany 5
Look at least he admits it
In Hungary this is very popular among young adults and gypsies as well
Sort of the last
Not actually hate but they think they are a third group who have been just used by both sides for their goals
Which if you think about it isn't so far from truth
Well it’s usually related to education or just the neighborhood they grew up in or the area where they come from
Based
It will be a civil war in Poland
Do you know any good anti-vaccine music
"Do you know who I am
We already have packages for different sites (facebook, etc
) here in Hungary
You just don't pay extra for them, instead they are free and you pay more for the rest, but the same thing
Not in your country
Hungarian grape producers got paid serious money to eradicate their grape production
The contract stops them from regrowing plants for 5 or so years on them lands
Many producing companies (sugar for example) got bought out and got closed down
I'm sure there are plenty more
Maybe they are not connected to big corporations, but the event is precedent in the EU as well
They should have invested in agriculture, but growing other crops
There still are serious aids toward certain plants (or livestock in some areas I guess)
I don't dare to check cattle stock in Hungary for the last 15 years
EU membership killed the whole milk production here in mid 2000s.
I really hope history is being written today
Single syllable river is such a bullshit though
Yeah, well, Budapest's river is *two* syllables
Excuse me, I'll have you know it's two syllables
It doesn't apply to Budapest
It does apply to Bratislava though
This decision sucks
How hard would it be to change the constitution based on a citizen initiative and refferendum ?
Based poland
doubt the abortion part
Orban knows he won't get more wotes out of it
kind of doubt the anti-LGBT part as well (yes, I've read the telex article) but I'd rather put my money on the "gypsies problem"
I think his crimes are not that well known
I'm a simple Hungarian
I see Slovakia, I like
According to the official site, [koronavirus
gov
hu] more than 1400 tests were made
Crabs
Nice, but I've said it before: whatever the US does we must care about Europe and make sure we can take care of our own problems
We must get our shit together
I like a friendly US, we have a lot in common
But that's all
Erdogan is gonna have a rougher time after this
Well, hold your horses
Trump lost, true
Biden won, also true
But did the US Average Joe win
...unlikely
Lets have a short lesson on contemporary politics of Hungary
...once upon a time this chap named Ferenc Gyurcsány won the "presidency" (became prime minister), acted like Trump, did the [retarded media impression
] people more than had their fill with him
Thus Orban got elected, seen as the "lesser evil" even by moderate left, and as the second coming of god by the right
...look where we are at today
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Due to the small rabid fansbase that Trump retains, it plausible that he will try to take part in Republican politicking, which can easily lead to the party imploding
And making any sort of opposition to democrats impossible
Which leaces the states with a demnocrat party that can act like if it were the communist party of the USSR
Can't wait to see our Trump-butt licking prime ministers suddenly have a change of heart
>I don't think Trumpism is gone
Biden won by the thinnest of margins and Trump will absolutely make a stink going out
If my countries history is anything to go by Trump is a dead man walking
As in his biggest challenge will be to secure a grave site where people won't find a way to shit and spit on it
We had a similar leader in Gyurcsány Ferenc of the ["we fucked up speech"] fame
He is now a perfect political chip for Orban to get away with whatever he wants
As he is always part of the opposition, and makes plenty of people uncomfortable with that
I would expect the democrats acting to make ABSOLUTELY sure, that Trump won't go to jail, and continues a very tragic political career
As that will allow them to make republicans implode, and do whatever they please
Considering we are talking about polticians that expression needs to sound a lot more scary
>let's just hope that Trump quits the White House on peaceful terms
Lets ope democrats won't abuse the fact that Trump is a republican with a loyal irraional fanbase
It could lead to shattering the Republicans, and an effective on party state
Thats how we ended up with Orban after the [öszöd speech]
Which is the exact same thing we said when we elected Orbán, after Gyurcsány "[we fucked up] Ferenc
The opposite
The democrat warmongers are back in power, matter of time before they start bombing the shit out of the Middle East again
Then Erdogan will once again blackmail the EU for money for stopping the flood of refugees, or he'll release them to Europe
...keep in mind, that Orban got elected for the first time as the "lesser of the two evils" after the ["We fucked up speech"]
Nah, he's from their tribe so he's flawless
Just like Trump was for many Republicans
> It shows that despite Trump is (politically) dead, Trumpism is not
>I think that this result is probably better for the Republican party
We had the same situation here, with Ferenc Gyurcsány imploding the left (Trump will likely implode the right), and now we have Orban
Should we be happy
...i wouldn't be so optimistic about an extremely destabilized political spectrum in a two party state
>Finally some fucking good news in 2020
We had the same feelings when Orban won after the ["Öszöd speech"]
Lets just say "don't count the chickens beforre they are hatched
>Thank fuck, now abolish the electoral college and introduce more than two parties or the issue will remain until you do
The issue is the "first past the post" voting system mathematically enforcing a two party state, unless one of the two parties implod
Like here in Hungary after the [Öszöd speech] that perfectly describes the party that made Orbán win, and the opposition implode
...wait till your saviour turns out to be somehow worse
That's how we got Orban
>As a pro eurasian I'm happy, With this election Turkey will be able to leave Nato
...well its a nice dream
However on has to be very high ot believe it
(Keep in mind its not unlikely that Hungary would tag along with you, if the plan wouldn't be suicide
Turkey is not a major power
It completely lacks its own industry thats necessary to fight its own wars
Drone striking the hell out of armenia, is a lot less impressive when you cannot produce key parts domestically
Fighting without night vision and heat sensors is fighting blind this day and age
&#x200B;
>make an alliance with Russia and China
If we do this we can prevail all region
China and Russia are NOT allies of each other
The tag along against the states for sure
However both seeks to utterly dominate
A strong Turkey is incompatible with the plans of either of them
One cannot allow a country with working politics and a decent army, the other cannot stomach one that isn't in a debt trap
If only Orban was good
I mean Dems/their sympathisers are just as petty as childish as Trump, so I say they deserve it
Its only fair
>If they’re ignored again they’ll make sure another Trump gets elected next time - and next time he might be competently evil
You are delusional
Everyone is a hero in his own story
There is no such thing as evil, only people who see the world in black and white, and crusade to unmake black
&#x200B;
>Someone needs to stand for these people and help them, otherwise things are going to get worse
Things wont get worse in the way you think
Trump lost all but the irrational core voterbase
However the demcorats gained the best ally in Trump
The useless idiot who makes the republican party completely unpalatable
This could easily lead to the republicans imploding
And history repeating what happend in my country after the [Öszöd Speech]
This can easily mean democrats with UNCHECKED power for a decade - and we are talking aout career poltiicians, don't get your hopes up
Still can't believe System of a Down released 2 new songs before Cyberpunk got released
Cmon CDPR
The fact that GOP did diddle all to improve their situation, doesn't mean that people didn't vote for them out of desperation
It means that got scammed, as it tends to happen with voters in representative demcoracies
Campaign seasons promises and action tend to have nothign in common
&#x200B;
>long they persevere in their crusade to make the lives of those they despise even more miserable than their own
No one is out there doing the evil laugh, and marking tasks the managed on the "evil overlord to do list".
Everyone is the hero of his/her own story
If you honestly think there is good and evil side to politics you are deeply deluded
And not much better than the crusaders who said "God will know his own" before slaughtering cities that hosted heretic christians
The right got scammed
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
And expect the left, to make most out of the right having Trump as a party member
The "i am not Trump" card will be played into oblivion, and will allow people to get away what some shit that is arguably sketchier than what Trumo did
(Yes, that is how politics in Hungary work since the defeat of our scandalous [Gyurcsány "we fucked up " Ferenc] and Orbán is milking everything out of that situation)
It would be better
However the people who have power are not interested in creating rivals, and a political landscape where its harder to win
After all its much easier to gain votes for a big party, if your side doesn't have small parties
Since the democrats are unaffected by Trump, they can abuse the political vacuum, and the terrible reputation of republicans to create a de facto one party state (even if its not de jure, in practice it matters little)
Why would the demcorats not (ab)use said once in a lifetime opportunity
>Turkey is important for Russia because of straits and mediterranean and Turkey is important for China because of Economic
Turkey is Russia's cuba
Ofc
its important for Russia, when its hosting the nuclear armaments of the big opposing nuclear power
Doesn't mean that Russia wnts to be your ally, or is willing to live with a non-fucked up Turkey
Turkey always will be in a geopolitical psoition where it threatens Russia if its strong, and allies with an opposing major power
Similarly to what Cuba is to the states
And if Turkey conforms to Russia's wishes, expect it to be in a state like today's Cuba, not some kind of utopia
&#x200B;
>You are right but, you are wrong too
I know, Turkey isn't a super super super power but, Turkey is one of the big powers in mediterranean and middle east
Turkey's military power is strong and also Turkey has military bases over 10 countries in these areas and with military power Turkey has influence on these countries
I completely agree that Turkey is one of the big regional powers in the middle east
It is perfectly capable of going toe to toe with states like Iran or Saudi Arabia
As its one of the two powers in siad region (Isreal being the other one) with competent military personnel, and a healthy military culture - in the sense that it doesn't sabotage its own ability to wage war
Most arabic states have enormous issues on that front
Iran's early WWI era strategy in the Iraq-Iran war also not somethin to brag about, that was obsolete by 1917, long before the first world war ended
To put the military situation of the middle east in perspective, the whole region ganged up to beat Israel and failed miserably, multiple times
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
There is no "easternmediterranean" there is only mediterranean
We are definietly not living in the era of the battle of lepanto where it took months for fleets to travel from one edge to the other, if the wind favoured them
Furthermore if Turkey starts attacking Eu countries, or frankly any democratic country on he continent it will catch a lot of international flak
You can sneakily muck around in the civil wars of the ex-soviet republics of central asia, and near east no problem
As said states have pretty much zero power, little in the way of meaningful allies, and were already at war
Winning a military conflict for the control of the eastern half of the mediterranean is not just "beating greece".
And nothing like the invasion of Cyprus
Which was an invasion where you had 4-10 times numerical superiority, against a defense force that was largely a militia
Frankly it was as serious a military campaign as the Argentinian invasion of the falklands
Yeah, it would be surprising to see you fail to take it
However its not a feat that will make others tremble at the sight of your military might
&#x200B;
To win the east mediterranean you need to win submarine warfare, and the air over it
Which would require you to win a land war in the balkans, i fail to see how thats something Turkey is able to achieve
I'm rooting for all the people in Belarus
Your beautiful country deserves better <3
What kind of dictator doesn't simply drone or carpet-bomb protesters
Fucking weaksauce
lol, nothing will happen
We've seen thousands of these anti government protests the past few years but they never went anywhere
EDIT: Downvoted for not hopping on the reddit hype train
Yeah man, it should be Velence
At least it's not the Hungarian flag
I usually laugh when they mistake Slovakia and Slovenia but this
De putain
At least I know where all that rampant stupidity comes from
To be honest in Europe you are free to be as ignorant and arrogant too, just somewhy in USA you can be proud of it
To be fair its a very inclusive EU map
It has 3 other continents in it
Not to mention historical importance
Iowas contribution to the world isnt really comparable to Italy or France
I don't think that's the Maine problem
I had to look up if I was making up that word or it really exists because of your comment lol
except that zoos are closed for a year and struggling to survive, there was cases where even wealthy countries had to feed carnivores with the herbivores from the zoo, and also hunting and fishing isnt stopped, so its just worse for them now
Not to mention the Brexiters' railing about the unelected EU burocrats meaning the EU Council, which is made up of PMs
Hungary, the place where you only see grass, the home of the Alföld
Sweden is nice
The Netherlands smoked em all
Gesundheit
Hungary is actually not that bad
Most of the country is on the Pannonian Basin and trees are not growing there naturally
And we have to fight invasive tree species for screwing up that ecosystem
Also at least in Hungary's case, 70% of the country is forested steppe, so the forest cover was naturally never really high
This is really sad use of polish taxpayer money
Hope you guys can win this, Lukasehnko's power is already crumbling
You can see how the countries with the worse leadership think better about America
As a hungarian (which I am) it is pretty sad to see this
I was expecting way worse from Hungary considering I've encountered so many people sharing Trump's ideas
Even my parents, who oppose our current government consider the US's system fine
They only get the news from Hungarian sources mostly, they viewed the US as that dream place ever since communism ended
The idea that it's not Hungary means that it must be a better place in their heads
Like, I always get weirded out by the MAGA people then realize what kind of people the FIDESZ supporters can be, still, so many years later yelling Soros
But, the US system does work **BETTER** than ours
I'm certain the US has roads you can drive on, we too have, some
You know the joke that if an American is drunk they are driving left and right, but if a Hungarian is sober they drive left and right between potholes, but if they are drunk they just drive through them
Even the little money you got through the pandemic is more than the big fat 0 we got
The US minimum wage is dream wage here
It doesn't matter for many that your rent is higher or some stuff are more expensive, we just see that you got money from the government, you have an "insanely high" minimum wage
That's enough for many of us to say that "yeah, the US system works well".
I'm not defending the results, but when you compare the US system to the one in Poland/Hungary you'd also say the US is probably better
Of course Hungary and Poland think it's fine
cmao
Most of us are fffing stupid, man
I wish that we had a better government
I mean with my limited knowledge of the political system I think there's nothing conspicuously wrong with it
I think they have very effective systems to avoid tyranny and to ensure the fundamental right(s) to liberty for citizens
They had a bad leader and just got rid of him the next election
We've been struggling with ours for a decade now
All the recent controversies concerning the US were related to the public being not reasonable/uneducated/fierce and not to the political system
I mean if anyone, we know when a broken political system, and compared to us the US system works miraculously well
You can acrually vote people out of office, which is becoming increasingly difficult
To me the US system is a lot less broken than what we have in Hungary, so it is *comparatively* less broken
"Well, it's better than here so who cares
Not much surprise
In Hungary, we're basically heading towards a two party system
The liberal side are working together in their hate against Orbán, but I think it's a really unstable alliance without a real and competent leader, only held together by the Orbán-hate
So it's basically FIDESZ against everyone, except of course the minor parties, among which maybe one or two makes it in the Parliament
Why oh why
How can we let this happen
uhh, im not even surprised
on the other hand from the outside it seems better than ours, at least Usa has max 8 years, then no matter what, president is out
meanwhile we will have Orban for another 20-30 years
well, US has at least 2 parties to vote on
in Hungary you have Orbán
at least Poland sucks US dicks, not Putin and China
lesser evil
Do you even know what fascism is
Look up 1930’s  and 40’s italy or germany for reference, then look around in poland and hungary
These countries are hybrid regimes at best
As a Hungarian  I second this
Also it is strange that there is no data about the other post-soviet countries
I think it can be a cultural difference too between old and fairly new ‘democratic’ countries but they didn’t show enough data to prove it
indeed
I wish we could just throw out Orban and friends after 8 years
I'm hungarian and I heard Romania is catching up
Doesn't matter
Life is better
It doesn't matter how many parties there are cause in hungary every single party is full of crooks, and no matter who is elected nothing is getting fixed
Just the same old snailpace  improvement that'll take 30-40 years to show any improvement
Hungary's latest voting system is greatly affected by the thoughts of some american specialists hired by the governing party
This shithole is the worst place I've ever been
Ive lost hope for both the country, and it's people
Coming back here was worst mistake of my life
We mustn't give up
They want us to lose hope but we mustn't! Apathy is one of the biggest problems in Hungary
The biggest problems are the lack of opportunities
The egos on some people, and an outdated mindset that no longer works in the modern world
I don't see how the last part will ever be doctored as young people leave
Well, it's true that it's an awful situation, and there are several problems
But there must be a way out
I don't yet know how
There is a way out
Wait about 20-30 years, then an additional 10
We do something
Aren't there like millions of people who are disgusted and outraged by what they our doing to our country
I don't know the exact number, but let's go with 3 million
Let's say the tenth of these people start protesting
That would still be huge
Why can't this happen
Bannworthy opinion: Antifa (and related extreme leftist direct action groups) are not any better
Based
Why cannot one equally hate antifa & nazis
Why does on have to be friends be Either with nazis, or with left wing extremists
...if you ask a communist USA citizens are fascists
...if you ask a 'Murican, then anyone even contemplating state sponsored healthcare is a fascist
By that logic i am one, jsut like all other living people
I would like to hear a sane, and coherent argument why i am fascist for despising people who sucker punch others with padlock, and commit arson on random people property (instead against the fascists they hate)
Anyone disagreeing with the methods of antifa is fascist
So if i despise people swinging padlocks at others heads i am fascist
P.s.: maybe consider, that people who advocate for murder and vandalims are evil, not the ones who dare to raise voice against it
...maybe the world is not white and black, but a spectrum of grey
Let me be clear
I don't like people semi-military groups marching down my street waving flags, and committing attrocities
I don't like disorganised mobs doing the same thing either
I fail to see how that qualifies as fascism
What if i don't like violent activism aither
As antifa advocates that, and i deeply despise it
Exactly as deeply as violent actions by right wingers
I like peace, rule of law & civilized behaviour
...yeah, what an ignorant attitude
Daring to not wanting to gt murdered by anyone, or my property destroyed for shits and giggles by anyone, regardless of political narrative, even if they are THE ANTIFA
Thats the pinnacle of fascism
>Violence for no reason isn't justified, and it should be criticized when it happens
just beware that fascists are absolutely able to come to power through peace, rule of law and civilized behaviour, and they're not gonna respect the exact things you value should that happen
They could
Sadly "fascist" has been used to describe everyone's opposition, as such everyone is antifascist
And sadly the "its just violence against fascist" can be used to justify violence against anyone
Which is what i deeply dislike about the whole clusterfuck
...well there is that infamous bike padlock incident, among others, and billion dollars worth of damage caused by vandals enabled by black block tactics
Ofc
All ANTIFA members are always inocent
As every crime ever committed during a black block protest, is done by far right elements trying to discredit you with false flag attack
As we all know ANTIFA member are physically incapable of harming others, let alone innocents
By antifa, i mean the antifa roganization
If you mean people who disagree with those groups by the label fascist, then fascist (defined by you), do what you not expect them to do
Purely due to your insane expectations
If you redefine fascist as people who oppose violence and vandalism, then following your redefinition, fascist (the members of the group defined by you) will oppose violence and vandalism
&#x200B;
...is it so fucking hard to grasp, that when you brand EVERYONE who doesn't support mob vigilantism as fascist, then most peace loving folks will be branded fascism in your deluded mind
I was wondering what the vaccine scar on my husband was
He couldn’t remember so this is good to know
Love it when Germans act honestly
First I legit thought it was a cave painting
Wishing you the best Bulgarian brothers
I mean yeah, the mafia should be kicked out from the leadership but there's a pamdemic going on
Hungary protested like this for 3 and a half years until the national election day came
The failed party acted like there was nothing wrong and promptly vetod every attempt for a new election te be held earlier
I expect the same of Bulgaria
I hope people keep it up until the next election
Happy cake day, friend
N'wah
I'm impressed how the most recent islamist extremism was reacted to by the French government
Europe has to prepare for a much more vocal, honest confrontation with terrorists that cannot cope with our very very very basic rights such as free speech
Lest we forget
While the claim is coming from a biased source, it would not surprise me if it was true
Engineers accidentally left a coffee stain on the plans and the construction guys did not dare to question it
"these protest were organized by Soros to distract us from what's really important before the voting: immgration" ~FIDESZ
Are you sure they are not protesting against the shitty weather in Köln
I can see big Hungary
We feel you man…
Kind of makes sense, state television is cancer
Cries in Hungarian
Hungary:
* Párbeszéd: Socialism
Thunberg
* MSZP: Socialism
* LMP: Thunberg
Liberalism
* DK: Liberalism
* Momentum: Liberalism
* Jobbik: Covert racists
* Fidesz: Overt racists
* KDNP:  Christians who are bible-thumpers and overt racists
* Mi Hazánk: Overt racists, probably not actually "independent"
* MKKP: Free beerism and IDDQD
> less parties in the gov with more stability and more efficiency
Yes, of course
And Poland was even more stable and efficient when only one party existed
Jesus
KDNP tried that in Hungary, it was adopted and then revoked in a year because in practice it was dumb AF
We got two great youtube songs out of it though
Wow
just wow
I like it how everyone has proper full name and capitalisation while Biden is just "US presented BIDEN" shouting xD
Rest of the world: Fuckin dying
Europe: dUcKs
DIGI
Upc/Vodafone
It's similar here in Hungary
I pay 10 euro for up to 1000mbs and always get 750+ with digi (it's a Romanian company)
Similar in Hungary
All about regulations, competition is pretty wild
We pay 10-11€ for 500/250 in Hungary
Weird how our salaries are lower, but we pay less for internet
and kinda pay more for everything else
Where did I say our salary is lower than Romania
What I said is how WE get less, but pay less for internet, but pay more for others
You look like the happiest person on Earth
That's genuine joy
Hope you achieve everything else you want to
Then you really scored in life, congrats
:-)
You can't make this law good tho
It will be always harmful to the end users
Only the big companies will benefit from it
I wouldn't be surprised if Sony and other big (mainly music) publishers paid the EU a bit
Seriously, why can't we have leaders like her in every EU country
Why do we have to suffer through the seemingly endless supply of stupid heinous crooks
Damn
She is a true leader of Europe and a very good politician
I just love the way she explains stuff, some politicians have a very characteristic way of talking and she is certainly one of those
Can't we have a Hungarian Merkel
Like our whole opposition can't show up with 1 competent (or not total idiot) politician
For hells sake, Fleto is leading our biggest opposition party
I mean, Trump only wants to build a wall on the Mexican border
We have an ocean there, which is clearly superior /s
Apparently we can't.
Even if we could, and somehow he/she could lead a party to a successful election (which would be near impossible considering how heavily it's skewed towards Fidesz), taking over the government of the country in it's current state would be political suicide
Assuming we'd get the best and most capable government the world has ever seen, it would take decades to get back to a reasonably healthy level and start building again
That means decades of political stability and actual progress without Fidesz ever coming back
Can you imagine that happening where there is Orban crooks literally everywhere and you would have to fight them every step of the way
I know I can't.
I may have low standards since Hungarian politicians have the rethoric skills of an introverted toad
Most likely she wants to retire
Leading a country for 15 years
That's something
But if not, we would be happy to take her as PM
Every economical block has its most prominent politicians who could be called de facto "leaders". They usually have a lof of soft power
And Merkel certainly qualifies for this
I think the only chance for Hungary is after-Orbán. He is Fidesz, without him the party is nothing but a bunch of old racist idiots (safe for a few people, but they would fight among each other)
I think Fidesz will loose eventually
They will win 2022 closely and (assuming they don't take a turn) they will loose 2026
Orbán is getting old and his supporters are getting less and less numerous every day
(since the avrage voter of him isn't the younger generations)
Now the problem is that what if he takes a turn again
He went from liberal, to center right, to far right, to Christian conservative
He changes colours very very fast indeedm
Let me rephrase it: The most significant leader in Europe currently, who has the most influence in EU politics
>holds no influence over any country but her own
I would argue she very much does, in the economical sphere of Germany (so eastern Europe) she does have a big influence
>not liked or respected by great many people in Europe
Sure, but even a President of a country isn't respected by great many people
Orbán undoubtedly is powerful here, but belive me Hungarians don't like him
Liking someone has nothing to do with anything
But that doesn’t have to do with leaving the EU
Hyvä Suomi
You do realise that the rumor was that he wanted them to make the vaccine be only available in the US
That is a little bit more serious than just stealing our specialists to work there
Regardless of the greater potential implications this was just a meme and you went all conspiracy theory over it
They watched to much maffia or what
I had this happen to me once, almost took my thumb with it
We live in a period
Interesting how it is stalinism but not communism
Seems a wee bit biased
I mean I guess it makes sense in the way that Molotov served under Stalin
Interesting
Must have missed out on this day since I never heard of it
Oh I just got a text message that my social credits have been reduced to 0
Oh I got another one that says I won a free vacation in China paid by Xi Jinping
Man he is so kind what could go wrong
Ah yes "it wasn't real communism"
I dunno maybe there isn't much attention paid to it becasue we have our own remembrance day for victims of these
Classic tankie arguments
I felt this shiet happening too

The European Lo-Fi Girl (40 lo-fi girls merged together)
[The collection of all lo-fi girls
&#x200B;
^(Unfortunately I didn't find the original poster of the collection, I found only this in my history
Well, not every
That’s why it’s only 40 pictures
Otherwise it looked “funky”.
Unfortunately I didn’t save that version
On the eye
bruh
>assumes everyone uses UK spelling
*Highly suspect*
omg I just thought of the funniest shit
The plans were made by hungarians, just saying
thats some proper ganda right there
Japan
as a hungarian who born in the 80’s only, fuck ussr and the soviets and their liberation
same level of shit as nazis were, just different colors
What is this
What the hell is this
Fun fact: no civilisation ever used the duodecimal system, despite the widespread use of _dozen_ in measurements
Some small languages have eleven and twelve among their digits, but they didn't use a positional notation numeral system
What do you have against it
Other than clocks looking a bit uglier
When you have a physical object, cutting it in half is easy, cutting it in five pieces, not so much
That's why americans love to use base 2 fractions
However they also often use thirds and twelveths to make things more confusing
_20 minutes_ would just become _30 minutes_ and we wouldn't really care about the 3⅓ minutes lost
We hungarians wouldn't, but i have a feeling that germans would
In Hungary we call them "fánk"
Naon pacek
And we don’t have a day for it we have a 40 day period called”farsang” before Easter
Fun fact, we have Gluttonous Thursday right _after_ Lent starts on Ash Wednesday, when you’re meant to eat until you hate yourself
A lot of restaurants offer heavy discounts on this day
No, Farsang is the period between Epiphany Day (6 Jan) and Shrove Tuesday
As of Ash Wednesday, up until Easter it’s 40 days of Lent
As a Hungarian, I can confirm that we stand on each other's heads

Czechia and slovenia too lol
Hungary is the least worrying
Jokes aside, the fuck is up with searching how to kill people and how they taste
Following that logic, it's more like halfway in; it's the most popular search among those that are not popular enough to be available in their language
The last time I googled something like that, it was for a short story I was writing
We have 28°C here and it's already too much
How the fuck do you survive 40+?
r/demotorization
And people say it’s crazy that Poland and Hunary are promoting Christian values
Sure it has it’s downsides, but secularism simply not working
Very impressive mental gymnastics you got here
That’s the thing
Secularism worked fine until it has been used mostly on Christians and Jews
In theory it should have worked with any kind of religion, but when Muslims came in to the picture shit went wrong
In fact it does not
They are still there after several hours
Inappropriate

For a second I thought it translated "ő politikus" as "he makes a lot of money"
WHAT can I say excep you're WELCOME
Well usually you can tell the gender from the whole or surrounding sentences so it's unnecessary
Our language is still fucking komplex and weird though
You dont understand
Its critical that we have 30 cases
I honestly never understood why gendered pronouns still exist in English
They're pretty much the only remnants of the past relationship of English with grammatical genders
They got rid of gendered articles and gender-based declension of adjectives ages ago, but they still insist on differentiating between he and she
why
We can also leave out the verb (as you've seen in this post), subject (often do that) and there are even one word sentences

Protest in Hungary for the freedom of press
Also the majority of the editorial staff of basically the last major independent outlet (Index) have walked out on their job today
It's absolutely wild to see momentum (progressives) and Jobbik (nationalists) flags side by side
Nothing will change
We will swallow this like everything else in the past decade
What's that, like a couple thousand people
Tops
In a country of 10 million
As if that's gonna change anything
And no, I did not go out either, and no, I do not have an excuse for that
This seems to be the prevailing mindset here: keep your head low, do not get into trouble and maybe those with power will let you live your little life in peace
lol wtf I didn't even know this was happening
I mean shit
I don't watch news
So what’s the purpose of the protest
Isn’t it too late
Corona liked this post
Bruh I'm also from Hungary but this is nonsence
There IS freedom of press in Hungary
Index was a terrible news site, with misleading titles and clickbaits also they also were sued a cuple of times because they were pisting false news
I can't make any sence ot of this protest other that some mainstream trend
And also it's a fact that Momentum (as a party) is founded by Gyorgy Soros
How about no
Not the majority, the entire staff now, except the ones on vacation
I am a hungarian, and after Index closing, i don't really know where to read independent news
*"independent"*
It's a sign
If we want change, we have to keep together
Enemy of my enemy
Jobbik is not nationalist any more
All the radicals left and founded Mi Hazánk (which is according to some people paid by Fidesz in the background
Jobbik is not nationalist anymore
Momentum is not progressive, they're just anti-fidesz, but not progressives
Sadly, Hungarians will stop protesting the moment it starts raining - source: I'm a Hungarian and that's how the last protest wave ended
Well, we protested in 2018 for 1-2 weeks every day and nobody cared
There was some teargas and police action too
And the major problem with this, that this is unfortunately not a joke
This is the intolerable reality  of our government
Ah that actually made me laugh good one
He will fall, and that fall will allow Hungary to be a true democracy
Like the way Slovakia did
It will happen in time
> Harder than anyone before
The USSR: Am I a joke to you
They did use tear gas in the end of 2018
This protest doesn't plan on going near the parliament building but from what I have heard the riot police already surronded the building just in case
Nah, Orbán's approach is more like "Ignore it and people will eventually have to work"
They literally killed the last independent news source that was also a big part of hungarian internet culture
At least the protestors here wear masks, not ARs :D
Somehow it went away for the protests in the USA so let's hope that applies here too
Well
During the quarantine most of the patients were kicked out from the hospitals
Many people died bcoz of this idiot decision
Yes, you read it well
This happened a few months ago
No, Orbán's tactic is literally "waiting it out"
Everyone knows how the big is the risk, but sometimes you have to act
Yeah, we haven't had a revolution in fifty years, it is time for another
Not with that attitude it won't change
The election in 2018 was rigged so we don't have many chance
They fragmented to a Nazi (Mi Hazánk) and a centrist (Jobbik) part
You can find pictures on 444
hu and HVG
This, but unironically
> i don't really know where to read independent news
Magyar Hang and 444
are both pretty good, the first one also has printed version
Here is the English Article from Index:
Hope this provides some context
He is blamed globally
Macedonia, Malaysia, USA the list goes on
Right wingers love to blame him especially
He is the target of all the attacks of FIDESZ, because they say he is going to settle immigrants in our lands
They call this the "Soros-plan".
Well they sort of legalized corruption in Romania so they take the cake here for sure
Also HVG, 24
hu and Átlátszó which does investigative journalism
But don't fall for the Azonnali meme
That is owned by Ungár who is the son of Schmidt Mária and who managed to destroy LMP
Not the 444, they are too onesided
Yes, but i want hungarian news too
They have been dependent on indamedia financially for a long time now
They let go of the person who ensuredd that they are independent in terms of articles
He wants to stay in the EU because while he Hungary is in the EU he can simply steal money
Not like it matters though
They're always going to be the ex-fascist party
Origo did mention that Gyurcsány made Index collapse as an effort to push Momentum out or something
True
We are very *__fucked__*
We are really brother nations in everything
Azonnali has some fun reports tho, but take anything they write with doubt
No, as long as I can't see gesturing hands

> certainly its anti-american imperialism part

The way you put that "anti-american" does not make it very clear

They are just literally just sperging out about their first world problems while being the most priviliged people in the world
Like you aren't gonna feel it, it's not like you can't afford what you have had before
This compromise is so European, long negotiations with everyone leaving can declare victory
Because he isn't the PM of Belgium right now
Don't get your hopes high up it doesn't mean shit
It's just another fake pretense that the EPP likes
Hungary and Poland will still get the money because the EPP benefits from authoritarian moneysinking shitholes
The important bit is that what they mean by rule of law and how this works exactly will be discussed later
Edit: All the downvoters will see that I am right
Just wait a few years and watch
Literally no fundings will be cut as long as it's the EPP
That's why they have to push even harder for cutitng fundings and have exact definition for rule of law
Of course they will never do that as long as EPP and their politicians are in power
As you can see they haven't been pushing hard enough, this whole rule of law thing has been worthless for years because no one comes down hard on it
And when a country was struck as hard by covid as Italy or Spain I am pretty sure they will spend a lot on relief
Great
I hope you guys succeed and every European country should follow you in this
Looks like the perfect place for an attack
Religion doesn't have to be crazy, most of our present day western morals and customs are rooted in them
Crazy people are crazy, and some religions just happen to be a perfect outlet for them
Atheists can do the exact same type of preaching and manipulation through politics

Disappointed with the ALDE
Gotta see who exactly voted for it
> But people don't understand because people are dumb and people are going to think "this other country voted against my interests".
It's not about that
I highly doubt that our government could push this through locally on their own, they've tried things like internet tax and protests have successfully made the government give up on the idea
But we can protest all we want, and in theory all our politicians could vote against it, this would still get through if the big players wanted it that way
I guess in that sense yes, the EU is to blame
Haha right yeah, assuming that elections aren't decided on sympathies and gut feelings of millions of people

Sure, but in the really long term they would be better off
Right now Japan is overcrowded
Yes, the pensions will offset the economy for 1-2 generations, but after that they won't struggle with tons of problems
If they can stop the decline, and that's a big if

Ok, so what I've learned from this thread so far:
- Dutch roads are impeccable
- Belgian roads are crap
- Eastern European roads are even more crap
- Northern countries are in a constant cycle of paving the roads due to low temperatures
- French and Swiss roads are ok
Austrian-Hungarian border
*cries in Hungarian*
When coming home from Austria I can tell when I've crossed the border with my ass
The motorways are indeed well-maintained over here, however, once you go down to priority roads or smaller roads
ohh boy
The quality of the roads differs quite a lot through Hungary
For example in Hajdú-Bihar County the roads are quite good in my opinion, however, in Heves County they are terrible
Higways are usually decent
Avoid the public "toilet house" thingies in highway rest areas though, they are nightmare fuel
The toilets inside petrol stations are usually very clean
Draw the hungarian lofi girl please

Yay my country is as progressive as Switzerland /s
Huh weird I thought it's legal in Switzerland
That is really sad
I don't want to sound like a strictly conservative person ('cause I'm not) but I'm just curious about your opinions
Since marriage is an ancient catholic ritual between a man and a woman is it okay to let them practice marriage
Now wait
I'M NOT AGAINST GAY PEOPLE I KNOW GAY PPL AND I'M TOTALLY FINE WITH IT
But isn't it enough that they legally they are allowed to live together, buy property together, to adopt child etc
This kind of living together doesn't have to be named marriage
I mean the point of this is to be able to live together, raise child, buy property together etc
Or am I missing something
Well Hungary for example is a very progressive country
We are progressing from light blue to yellow
Thanks to our fellow ~~minister~~ dictator Orban
How is stolen bit worse than land of the free and the best place ever
In Hungary you can be married or you can get a paper saying you are living with someone in a relationship but it has a lot less legal stuff than marriage
For example can't take each others names, can't adopt children and can't have artificial insemination
How would you describe that darkness

No wonder Krakow is unbearable in the winter, I've heard people saying it is basically a no-go zone because the smog is so bad
Too bad because it's one of the most beautiful cities I've ever visited
For anyone in the fence or completely against nuclear, [this] is a must read
To sum it up, nuclear is the cleanest, greenest, safest, and most financial viable form of producing energy known to us
If you receive a Belgian wage but live in Belarus
I’d imagine that’s a huge boost to your lifestyle
The cost of living is a lot lower so you can buy more with the same amount of money, so I guess it’s an understandable decision
UK #WINNING the maps recently
The american dream
Its Only 24c here today and I'm cold
I would gladly accept your 28c if you want to trade it
You know what is weird, Here in Budapest the new looking buildings around 2012 got destroyed and really old looking buildings got builded
There's a good chance that the common language would be Hungarian with all of this moving around
We have multiple Austria-Hungary, or what
Pass me the salt from Austria please
Where is this located
Imagine they would intruduce tarrifs (I now nobody can)
Are police officers banned from doing police stuff in other EU countries
Not to ruin the joke, but even back then, Austria-Hungary was much more like the EU instead of being a single country
Tiny nations, tiny tables
It's designed so that people eating there get into an argument over who uses their part of the table and start a war
"Country" /s
And then tell the Slovakians that their bench is actually a part of our bench
United we stand
Sooo, what would Austria contribute
From that pov, all of the table is actually Hungarian
Austro-Hungarian-Slovakian Monarchy for life
*sit
Didn't you know everything is Hungarian
Except Hungary before 1867
Holy shit
Womp womp bitch
Happy independence day neighbors
.... More land for us I guess
What
The
Actual
I think you could have gone with the current borders
They are the consequences of a few thousand years of conflicts between triggered nationalists or monarchs, still nobody is satisfied with them
So you just can't draw a map of Europe where a significant part of the population doesn't get offended
Hungary would’t even have Erdély
What kind of fuckery is this
Congratulation, you did
Oh my god
First thought was, before reading the caption "you son of a bitch".
So yeah, you succeeded
haha, ... ok
Schwitzerland is neutral too
I mean it worked that's for sure
Don't worry both sides are
Break Romania up, call Moldova Russia or Ukraine, rename Wallachia to Bulgaria, and Transylvania to Hungary or Trianon (just to trigger both sides)
Also break up Hungary completely, rename Slovakia to Upper Hungary
To be fair it's actually very good insult from a Hungarian standpoint
And funny as hell
Should have also separated Brittany and called it French Ireland or something
Also, why not rename France to Paris altogether
Yes but we have become the very thing we swore to destroy
Yeah he should have let the seashore to Romania and it would be perfect
But then I guess it would be too good for the Romanians
We have the high ground (they have the Alföld now)
Bruh we have the terrotory with the hungarian speakers
Hm, really
Do they really need to be bigger than this
> confusion of Romanians with Gypsies triggers us way more
Why
In the end, both are slavs
I assume they claim the rights of that particular recording, which might be correct
I wouldn't expect them to claim the rights of other recordings of the same piece
more Finnish as fuck: It's actually noon in the picture
Do this over Turkey and you will get free fireworks
well 2nd ref is unjustifiable
Still UK needs to be kept in the EU
Brits can thank scots and northern irish people for staying calm, smart and clever when they went crazy in 2016
I blame Cameron's powerplay
Just like i imagined from Irvine Welsh’s book
WEAR YOUR FUCKING MASKS THO
The balkan spring
Orbán is a wierd case, he tries to present himself as the "opposition" to the western EU states why complying with every German demand
He really is less dangerous then he presents himself
If only we had it too
Where is it
Us Hungarians are the only ones understanding the pain of everyone finding your language weird
Mi a faszt mondtál nekem, te kis kurva
Tudatnám veled hogy a legjobbak között végeztem a Magyar Honvédség osztályában, részt vettem számos titkos bevetésen az Al-Quaeda ellen, és több mint 300 halálos lövést adtam le
Kiképeztek gorilla hadviselésből, és én vagyok a legjobb mesterlövész az egész magyar fegyveres erőkben
Te nem vagy nekem semmi, csak egy újabb célpont
Olyan precizitással foglal kiirtani a gecibe amilyet még nem látott a Föld, jegyezd ezt meg
Azt gondolod megúszod hogy ilyen faszságokat mondtál nekem az Interneten
Gondold újra, seggfej
Miközben beszélünk, épp felveszem a kapcsolatot a Magyarországot lefedő kémhálózatommal akik pont most nyomozzák le az IP-címed úgyhogy készülj a viharra, te féreg
A viharra ami eltörli ezt a szánalmas dolgot amit te az életednek hívsz
Kibaszottul halott vagy gyerek
Bárhol lehetek, bármikor, és több mint hétszázféleképpen tudlak megölni, csak a puszta kezemmel
Nem csak fegyvertelen harcban vagyok kiképezve, hozzáférésem van a Terrorelhárítási Központ teljes arzenáljához, és ezt teljes mértékben használni is fogom hogy eltöröljem a szánalmas segged a kontinensről, te kis pöcs
Bár tudtad volna micsoda szentségtelen megtorlást szabadít rád az "okos" hozzászólásod, talán befogtad volna a kibaszott pofád. De nem tudtad, nem tetted, és most megfizeted az árát, te istenverte barom
Úgy telifoslak dühöngéssel, hogy bele fogsz fulladni
Kibaszottul halott vagy, öcskös.
Excellent "pivo" from the local brewery
Huge tank shooting range nearby
Nice place to stay
One of the beautiful place I visited in Europe
Looks a lot like Bern
At first I thought this was about him making threats about releasing the migrants to Europe
No mask
It's a kangoroo lol
haha cute
Poland did it again
Way to go
FYI, Hungary's is actually "kill seven flies with one strike"
In hungary: Hetet egy csapásra
(seven flies)
1 cup, 2 girls
Still Budapest is the "best"
Same in Budapest
Luckily municipal elections are coming and there is a candidate advocating for this case
[more]
[ Root for him, them, us
Reminds me to Midgar from Final Fantasy 7
In Hungary, we call these "landscape wounds", no building is allowed to be taller than our biggest temple in the capital
Yes, they are that stupid
I can see both of theirs, and its the same gif
[Here, I made an imgur mirror]
More jobs created
That's not how it works
Tariffs and paperwork are plentyful without the EU
All the EU does is add several more regulations that have to be checked that barely increase paperwork
With imports and exports this insane amount of paperwork is usually the norm
The shitshow we are seeing now isn't due to this being uncommon, it's due to a very short notice, unpreparedness and absolutely delusional expectations
EDIT: The EU has actually made it easier for member countries to import from or export to non-member countries, since goods transported through other member states require no additional administration for said transit
My city is on the front page of reddit
What a time to be alive
Bojler eladó!
Why is everyone talking about the Germans
I went to r/de and found the post but don't actually speak German
Could someone enlighten me
Budapest is usually used for Moscow, or some other Russian city, or occasionally WW2 Germany in Hollywood movies
In the Marvel universe it is even portrayed as a very Russian area but straight up called Budapest
Also there is futuristic looking mall in Budapest (Bálna) which is usually a Mars base or Nasa HQ in movies
So the EU is siding with China and India against the US and Brazil
Reading the comments I feel like I learn more fun facts about your country than I ever could from Wikipedia
It's so much fun to see how the little details that a foreigner eye would just skip are recognized and elaborated on by your countrymen
I just searched for the Romanian one and it's true for that version as well
Both are amazing artworks and it is an awesome initiative
Great work
I would love to see a Hungarian version of this at some point
Sad
Budapest was destroyed too
Old Köln kinda looks like some parts of Budapest
I hate thoose ugly socialist buildings
Did the commies really think that those are nice
Well it looks like it's not eastern vs western EU, but northern vs southern EU
Poland won, Greece lost
Fake
Hungary unemployment statistics is fake
For example: if you work a day in a year, you aren't unemployed in that year's statistics
Hungarian government lies as Greeks earlier
> All you have to do is pick the fruit, that's all
Yep
That's the problem
Not necessarily in Poland - i am not well informed on live able wages to make a call - but in many places its not viable
Apple is VERY cheap, at least compared to the amount of work needed to pick it in time before it rots
So most places rely on mechanization or part time workers to solve the issue
And at least here in Hungary we pretty much must use some pesticides to produce apple that can be sold, as most folks don't eat apple that contains maggots
>golden age of monarchies is so old even the flags are outdated
Wdym, Austria-Hungary still existed 101 years ago
Meh
My point was that the difference in flags doesn't indicate such a huge timespan
Hungarian media looks exatcly the same; we are continously under attack by Brussels, EU, Soros
Newly reformed public channel, M1 has a budget of 23 million euros and has become a non-stop propaganda channel
One of the two largest commercial channels, TV2, was bought by a Fidesz friendly oligarch and had the same fate
Utterly shameless
Same in Hungary, just throw in some anti-Soros, anti-charity, pro-religion stuff and some made up numbers how Hungary is the best economy in Europe atm
I mean, yeah, it's sad but pls, this is low level apprentice stage compared to what's going on in Hungary
Just one of the continously running anti-brussels ads:
For that very reason I don't watch TV in Hungary
Well, to be fair, the reason is that it's utter and complete garbage anyway, with or without the propaganda and I don't care for it
But I sure don't miss it
There isn't really a source that isn't biased
I'm usually reading online news, and all the sites are beginning to look like /pol, just throwing shit at each other
It's really shameful
Also 7th article will not happen because our government will back you up
This government always needs somebody/something to fight against to validate their actions
They had a "lucky run" in this respect with the migration crisis, but it started wearing thin last year, so out of the blue came Soros and the whole thing gets weirder each day
I don't follow politics that much and I know almost nothing about politics in general, but here's my theory which I find the most logical
Our government wants to stay popular with these "hatred campaigns". "You should hate and fear the migrants and now Soros
" If a topic wears out they find some other scapegoat
The main target group of this propaganda is the less educated people, they will believe it with no hesitation
This way the government/Fidesz convinces these people that they are protecting our country with all their strength (from something that isn't a real danger at the first place)
Thus the easily manipulated people have a higher chance to become supporters of the party
Pretty much what /u/vernazza said
RTL Klub was the first channel Fidesz tried to aquire, but was rebuffed and went for it's competitor instead
TV2 was mainly a tabloid channel, reality TV, celebs and such, never or rarely political
Even since the takeover, it became one of the most rabid pro-government channels, and many people who were there since it's founding in the late 90' left because of it
Some further reading if you are interested:
Here in Hungary we have the same, sadly
If anyone criticises the government, they're called an agent of Soros or someone who sold the country
My family is a very (and i mean VERY) big Fidesz-fan, and if I say anything against the government I'm instantly someone blinded by liberal lies etc
We had a far right "life and justice party" a few years ago
Now it's defunct

Great, vendors will have a chance to water up hygiene products like pubs do with drinks
yaay,Im not the last
What's up with Malta tho
No surprise here :\\ Orbán keeps winning by making the less strong-minded brainwashed by an intense 10-year-old media campaign
So he will do it as long as it works, and it works ...
Why am I not surprised
Hey, as someone who lives in the country that invented Soros being an evil mastermind, I feel you
Also I am afraid that we will join Bulgaria soon
Does the government spend hundreds of millions for propaganda just to tell everyone in every possible media outlet (where they own wast majority it) that the opposition is shit
A journalist was apparently killed by the government and other journalists say they're fearing their safety
How is this country above Hungary
What a dumbass list
What are these values based on anyway
Yeah, rags like "the sun" are what journalism
Journalism is basically state sanctioned propaganda at this point, or close to it
If you need a license to be a journalist, its not very different from China (yes, thats how it works there)
But really, I've never seen us so high on a positive list before
That’s because we’re in the EU, im guessing
Certainly not because of our Minister for Foreign Affairs… I bet you on that
same, and honestly, it makes me quite happy
...for now
Mészáros bought Digi :(
We are
*Roblox oof sound*
Pls no
And a new kind of torture begun
That's my home town
:"D
This is the underpass in Szolnok between city central and the Szécheny residential district
Mind you the town lies on the Great Plains, the only reason there's an underpass there is because of a train track
However the drain system is outdated (non-existent) so whenever there's a huge rainfall (which is more frequent due to global warming, Saharan warm dust meets cold arctic/alpine air from north/west), the underpass floods
whoa
where in Hungary was this
Visit Venice
Before Venice visits you

Singapore is a unique case, they are a city that is kind of a trading and financial gateway to East-Asia
Singapore in Europe would be the Netherlands these days
To be honest, I think the brexit is not bad for the EU
I actually pretty like it
A lot of times in the EU certain good legislations (1989-Social Charta, Joint Eropean Forces act [I donno the original name of that legislation], the first common ID law[EEU]) didn't come into act, because the UK refused to sign it, while every other nation did
And what I read all around the news from UK is: "... UK marginalised in the EU", and also the thing that mostly annoys me is that mentality that EU should give all benefits to the UK withouth following any EU regulations
Do they learn their ideas from Sovereign Citizen tutorial videos from youtube or what
The most dutch thin i ever seen in this sub was the proposal, that "well sea levels are rising, we must act
Let's reclaim doggerland
There is only one explanation, the kids get orphaned more often then elsewhere
Same in Hungary
Because our great landlords don't allow us to register their property as our permanent address
Sometimes they let tenants register temporary address, but that means nothing actually, your official address is still your permanent one
Well if there is no stigma, and they have a good relationship, why wouldn't they
...well the UK will join the europen but not really club, so you don't have to feel left out
at least you have a cooperation like this
in Hungary protests (of 300 ppl) only last 'til the weather turns shit
you go neighbours
maybe us hungarians will get inspired too
Looking at this pic its not more than 5 thousan people, they are hilarious if they think its a coup in the making
Same politicians don't really care even when its in the 50 thousands
rofl
Finally some coast for Hungary
I am sad that we are so far from everyone, but at least we've got the geysers
:D Hot shrimps incoming
As a Hungarian I approve this plan
Hungary was meant to be an island all along
At least Hungary got a sea back
You lose some you win some
Austria taking us over and us being relocated to a freezing hell (although beautiful) is quite unnerving to say the least
No more border disputes, lol
Yes, put Hungary to a remote island
Well done, couldn't agree more
I could live with that
(Hungary)
I'll take Iceland it's a very beautiful country
As a Hungarian, I approve of moving to Mosslandia
I think I have seen this one in the past
Help its freezing out here
NEVER
I want my great plains back
Thanks in advance Austria for keeping our country safe for old times' sake
Enjoy our hot springs, we've got new ones now
Also: no more neighbors stealing our land due to no neighbors
Hungary
I stil have my residence permit
Na végre tengerpart
I don't mind the lack of neighbors harder for other countries to invade
Also no more border questions/conflicts
Ngl I'd love that
Especially beautiful Iceland
Trianon safe borders
Seems like a good tradeoff for the shrimps and the coasts tbh
And also, I would imagine our country as a middle finger instead of a thumb
Rákpaprikásh, paprikáshtinthahalal
Hungary used to be bigger
Slovakia, Croatia and Transylvania (big chunk of Romania) was a part of the "historical" Hungary
We lost it in WW1
The treaty "celebrated" its 100 th birthday a few days ago
100 éve and we're still talking about it
Probably 1000
And their children spoke Croatian
God-Empress of Germankind
Rest in peace
Guys, who the fuck invited Moon Moon
that looks like a bear
According to this, not only Budapest but the entire Pest county is considered developed
It's somethin' man
how the fuck did Budapest and Pest county make it into the more developed regions category
It's baffling how not even West and Central Transdanubia are transitional regions
Aside form Central Hungary, those are the most developed regions of the country
Hungarians, is it just me, or is it sad how all of hungary is less developed except for Pest megye
In EasternEurope, u either bad or good, there is no middle
Map is definitely missing Savaria (now Szombathely)
Budapest (the lonely dot around the middle of Hungary) was built next to a pre-existing celtic village too
And Hungarianness
Everybody's waiting for their country I think but boy this is gorgeous
My maternal grandparents both fled Hungary in the 60’s to escape Soviet rule
My grandfather swam across the Adriatic to get away from the bloc
I can’t imagine what living under those times must’ve been like
These are our heroes
Glory to the heroes
Also I would like to take the opportunity to say thanks to all the nations who accepted the people who fled the country once the revolution was lost
About 200000 people were welcomed by western nations
I’m a proud to be Hungarian
The soviets would soon fall
Wrong Russian flag - and date - in 1849 :-)
I don't. The museum is run by one of Orbán's most outspoken supporters who uses every platform she has to spread hate speech and propaganda
If you disagree with our current government's policies, please don't contribute a cent to it by visiting this museum
There are other ways to learn about Hungary's history
I believe it's free admission today
There wasn't enough time to outline any political plans besides that the Red Army should leave and Stalinists should be ousted from power
Those - mostly local - leaders who organized or even proposed anything resembling political institutions - eg
local elections, assemblies - were given special attention during the following retributions
Nagy was a reform communist, and he freed former political prisoner social democrats who joined the new government
But on the ground level the movement was very varied ideologically, including even royalists
people were fighting for simple democracy and freedom
Putting labels like that is obviously wrong given that socialism fucked our country just as much nazism did
Hungarian neutrality along the lines of Austria and Finland, obviously
probably nothing
The communist party received 17% in the 1945 elections and 22% (despite cheating and changing the electoral law) in '47
The majority of people were anti-communist
> Some of my friends who came here then as children today share my sadness how Hungary today deals with refugees
And how many of those refugees (or their children) bombed concerts, rammed trucks in crowds or attacked HQs of newspapers in the name of Communism (or a religion)
Hungarians were/are also perfectly fine with refugees arriving from the former Yugoslavia or Ukraine
They fit in and didn't cross multiple safe countries on their way which they didn't like because of economic reasons
Nope, the arrow cross party was first to repurpose the building
Speaking about the electorate, nobody has a "crush on Russia" in Hungary
Those who repeatedly voting Fidesz to majority (rural, small-town and not-highly educated people) are mostly comsuming the state-controlled-media which barely or not at all speaks about the government Russia-friendly actions
They -the Fidesz- know it's not a topic what they can win over voters with
You can learn about it in the non-government media tho, but since people who consuming these are already mostly opposition voters it can't help much
Not sure
He wrote a book in Hungarian but my Hungarian isn’t quite good enough to read something like that
The Russian intervention was a response to the dethronement of the Habsburgs, in 1849
Therefore, Russiaball's response shall be dated accordingly, as the comic is misleading in the current state (and I'm nitpicking)
And, according to [Wikipedia] the simple tricolor was the merchant flag of Russia at the time
That's not something under which land armies march, I assume
(The Tsarist flag had the eagle superimposed and the various army regiments had [their] [own] regimental regalia
She likes to skew - or outright falsify - facts here and there, but if you don't understand the accompanying texts, you're generally safe
Both the building and the exhibition can be interesting for foreigners as an introduction
(Although the locally-known Dózsa László debacle was just a disgusting shitshow on their part
I get it, it *is* a well-known institution after all
:) Just something to keep in mind
What’s the title
I’d love to check it out, sounds interesting
What plans
Those flew out of the window after armed conflict broke out
(The optimal resolution would be the Soviets leaving and Hungary obtaining neutrality, followed by elections
There's no telling how they would have gone, but post-war elections in [1945] and [1947] resulted in the majority of popular votes for the smallholder's / non-communist parties
Countryside revolutionary leaders rarely had close ties to the Party either
Looking the other way on technology *transfers*, for example
A huge empire cannot be allowed to fall suddenly, too many things could go horribly wrong
yeah well it still claimed about 250,000 lives and irrepearable damages to the economy, so I dont see nothing wrong calling each regimes equally as awful
*forgot to mention when the Red Army raped their way through Hungary, which also adds up to the death toll
*Obviously
* (The USSR leaving Austria in exchange for its neutrality was a recent development then
) What-ifs are free
The state secret police (already under communist influence) set up shop there in 1945 already, if the Hungarian wiki is to be trusted
Interesting, the city was barely functional then
However, it became so infamous that it was repurposed after the revolution
IIRC the brutal retribution caused various Western communist parties to split and slowly sink into obscurity or to become outright irrelevant (and seen for what they were: Soviet puppets)
Supporting the USSR's great experiment just wasn't as chic as it used to be
Well holy shit I thought he used some small boat or something but no, literally swam with nothing, then somehow got successful in New York, that’s impressive
> ultimately led to improving workers and farmers lives
If you're willing to disregard those workers and farmers whose lives were destroyed (often literally) as a consequence, then yeah, obviously
Don't pay much attention to alcoholism and suicide skyrocketing during progress either, that's just a side effect of lives being improved
Couldn't handle the speed
Yeah I really wish I could read it but sadly I suck at reading Hungarian
Most of my skill is just conversational
It's time to visit an opthalmologist, then :-)
Free societies don't have press gangs roaming the countryside, forcibly convincing smallholders to join the nearest collective farm
Nor do they have labour and internment camps
> there were no internment camps in the US in the 1940s for Japanese people
Wartime is, *by definition*, an exceptional state
A lot goes during wartime that's unthinkable during peacetime, including shooting people, bombing people, stabbing people, clubbing people etc
> nowadays at the US/Mexico border or at the EU-borders
Those aren't *internment* camps
(A state can only inter its own citizens
> Also there are no forced sells/people withdrawn from their lands like in Latin America and Asia
'Forced sell'. That's a modicum better than 'forced' w/o sale
Does the state directly organize and allow those
Let me educate you a little bit on how socialist Hungary dealt with the problem of people not wishing to join the state-run collective farms that were clearly in the best interest of the affected
Gang of state-employed activists showed up at homes and demanded the proprietor to join
Refuses
Local police/council shows up, takes the proprietor to an interrogation
Beats him up, because that's how you convince people to part with their property - if he dies, he dies
After a few days, he's let go, because that'll send a message to the entire community
Rinse and repeat until he joins
Here comes the best part - under socialist law, one member of a household 'joining' the collective farm applied to every other member, too
(I'll leave you to guess the price of the property
&#x200B;
Edit: if your translation engine is *the* cutting edge of today's socialist technology, then nothing has changed :-)
I wonder why the danes don't push for the coronabonds :D They are strict fiscally and they don't give in to corporate interests
Hungarian Army IRL
I think Trump was right to let the left and blacks riot during the pandemic, it will help the republican demography
It's kinda familiar for me
It's the same situation in Hungary
Atleast you have debates, our shit president doesn't even bother doing any kind of interviews or debates
If he wants to have more votes at the election he can just import voters from Ukraine(who can vote for some reason) or he can just give a bag of potato and a glass of pálinka to the poor people to buy their votes
Could someone give me a youtube link for this, please
Welp, at least they practice social distanting
Almost same shit in hungary
It is the same
Trust me, majority of us hate this system very deeply, but we cannot do anything against it
Trump even complimented Orban when he was using hate policies
And now Orban made Hungary a dictatorship until he doesn't want it to be anymore, it's a f*cking joke how people still try to defend him
Dithering
Hello
As someone from Hungary, good luck
Fidesz hasn't touched abortion laws here yet, but  public healthcare and the independence of universities are on the chopping block rn
Croatian tourism in shambles
Was it warmer, because there were more lower altitute places
Impossible
Actually my geography teacher told about this when we were learning about the economic geography of the post-Yugoslav countries
ITT ppl saying immigration is good and some ppl dying cause of those is "fine"
As unbelievable as it sounds, most people do not understand satire, and will think this is an insult to them
As a Hungarian I fully approve many more Hungarians need to learn of tolerance and respect for each other
(Edit spelling error) :)
Update: The flag has already been teared down by radical football fanatics
To be fair not a big suprise
I live in Hungary, and i haven't heard of this yet
Thanks for letting me know, this makes me so happy :D
Hmm, no
Budapest is just like any other capital city, it belongs to the tourists and office workers
There is hardly any reason to visit down town for those who live in the outer districts, and it is also getting harder and harder because of the closed streets and bus/cycle lanes
Our country is being ruined by the agents of caos
chaos* english is not my native language sorry
It's commendable, but also a pretty good way to lose the next elections
bruh
some football ultras tore it down and burned it tonight
Nah, he is already hated by gov media
Lmao you couldn’t be more wrong
Black people get spit on, if you are gay most people will hate you no matter who you are
Hungarians are really ignorant
Most people above the age of 45 are voters of the political party called Fidesz
They a literally robbing the whole country and the general society thinks it is okay to do so
Majority of young people who study at a university wants to leave this shithole, as it seems like we cannot change anything
Orbán doesn't care, if his rular voters would be oro-LMTQ so would he
Who's furious are the "journalists" of his party, who actually belive the shit they write about
We accept Italians too <3
To be fair, the problem isn't in Budapest or the major cities
It's in Mucsaröcsöge where they haven't moved out of the socielist mindset
hungARYAN
And
The Civil union already has the same benefits as marriage
Instead of focusing on contriversal and empty things like that we could focus on discrimination of homosexuals in adoptation procedure
One of the opposition party called Momentum did a solidarity protest for the people of Belarus during August 11
I AM CHAOS
I AM DEATH
I AM
GAY
I am a gay living in a small village in Borsod county (which some consider as the most underdeveloped and backward region of Hungary)
I came out to my family and close friends years ago, but nobody hates me because of my sexual orientation
And they are far from being liberal
I can live a relatively normal life
The only annoying thing is the usage of "buzi" as a general swear word in every third sentence
Also, our university towns, like Debrecen, Szeged or Pécs are full of Black people
I know some of them, and they are perfectly fine
They only know about minor isolated cases, e.g. when pensioners thougth that they are migrants and similar sad things, but that's all
So what are you talking about
You are generalizing the same way as our fellow countryman do it with minorities, except you are doing it with Hungarians
I'm not gonna pretend racism and homophobia don't exist, but get real with their generalizations man
Lived here for 6 years, I personally saw two cases of black people being fucked with, and homophobia exists too of course, mostly right wing/older people from what I've seen
And it's not like I don't have any friends who are gay or black
They don't paint a terrible picture with their personal experiences, either
Sure, they have had hardships, but it's not like they hate living here because of those reasons
The leaving part, eh yeah
lot of people around my age (25) want to leave, but have family, friends, opportunities, hope, etc
University students were majority Jobbik voters when they were the old self far right party
umm hello
based department
It isn’t really
It’s the state of the country that scares us
For example our life expectancy is lower than the retirenent age for males
Our education system instead of improving just gets eorse and worse over the years
Both higher education and lower education
Seeing football stadiums built up from nothing even though we suck at it, then walking into a hospital that looks awful
Waiting for countless months even years for a surgery is regular
There is a guy who used to be the Hungary-Peru ambassador got busted for having over 19k child porn on his cumputer then got a 1500€ fine
These are some of the reasons Hungary is fucked, but we could go on and on with listing things but we couldn’t finish it today
For better salary nothing more
there's many reasons for that but same-sex rights isn't one of them
I could be shot for treason for agreeing with a Romanian, but you are goddamn right lol
Depends, in Budapest
Definitely not, even Fidesz voters are Okey with him since he didn't do things that would go against their values
Outside Budapest
Yeah very much, in many places people only consume pro-government media (think of it as people who only watch BBC if BBC was blatantly for low-class and radically pro-Torry)
I advise you to look at the Index (online media) article posted in their facebook
Just look at it
I live in borsod as well, my cousin came out as a bisexual and his family is not far from completely disowning him
They banned him from coming to family gatherings
I think you are just in a lucky situation
As for the student cities, of course people going to be more tolerant as time goes on but they still get discriminated
I’m glad for your situation right now tho
I mean on the countryside 100%. As of the other “big” cities is also mostly yes
I never really lived in BP but its not as full of really conservative old people
I would disagree
Since civil union is marriage in everything but name mosst off the people accepted it as a thing already
Many just doesn't want to give up the idea of "sacred marriage" out of religious belief
The adoptation issue is mostly due to being managed by Christian democrats from Fidesz's coalition party KDNP which is filled with the worst kind of people in the country (like the minister who thinks 10 commandments heal better then the Healthcare system while being a doctor)
Orbán isn't genuinely anything, he has no values outside love for power
Goes as the wind blows, says whatever brings more votes
Fidesz voters are okey with him, because the party isnt pertfect
Sadly, every other party has problems too, mostly the MSzP, because of the öszödi beszéd. The only problem with Karácsony, that he isnt that sharp minded
But he tries to be a good guy, and there is a really a few politicans who tries itq
Yeah that flag just got teared down as well
I think he also genuinely likes money
Ain't certain though, he only surely stole couple billions yet
Boldog Cake napot
Basically, wanted to stay with a European example since American politics are very distinct
I mean, some Torry biass and "If you don't vote Torry you aren't British and want migrants to eat us" is two very different things
But most of it was spent on keeping him in power
Constant campaigns in every media consume a lot of money
Köszi
Same in hungary
In Hungary we would go from house to house and spray parfume on each girl and woman and in return they give the boys and men decorated eggs, chocolate (eggs) and a bit of money
In the past we would also pour a bucket of water on them
Now that this whole virus is going on, this wont be celebrated at all
Poland just wanted yearly wet t-shirt contests
In Hungary at least Aprils used to be quite hot already so at least here it isn't an issue
I like how every other nations brings water usually and we bring parfumes
I feel like someone mistranslated something in the past /s
We still have a local railway station named Aquincum there in Budapest
I wonder what are the numbers of total similar situations
This is what you call integrity
He finally realised that he shouldn't be serving dictators

what is his rank
just a simple policeman
thanks btw
yeah he is just a random officer just above street thug level, "police captain" implies a lot more important rank
>death threats
This is when I would have taunted them "come and get me then", as if they could
Death threats are the worst arguments and they are the ones that say "I am weak af in real life"
Well played
Jeez, this is unbelievable even by Hungarian standards
I had to visit a couple of hospitals lately because of my father and some are shitty, but this is a whole new level
Our hospitals are hopelessly understaffed and our entire healthcare could collapse any time but
wow ... I can't even
Umm what
I know we don’t have the best but its not as nearly as bad as that
Source: been in one of the dumpier hospitals a while ago and it was better than that
Seriously
I spent two weeks around Bucharest, Covasna, castle Braun and not a single freeway
I kept hearing it’s because of corruption
We have 15% and 27% VAT
Im not so sure about the first one
EDIT: looks like the eastern Swedish  people arent happy today
Muhahahhaaa downvote me all ya want im not going anywhere hahaha
How do you pronounce that thing
It's like one of my movies

Finally we're first in something
Finally something that Hungary is best in in Europe
Yet it's fucking hard to find porn where they talk hungarian
Umm, mi van Magyarországgal
I'm not surprised that we have the most whores in the EU but I always seen more czech ones

Just Prague and Budapest became the hub for the porn industry thats what  makes all the differences

Alright, we shouldn’t act as if the BLM protests wouldn’t have anything to do with the daily cases being up in the US (I mostly support peaceful protests because I think it is a basic human right to protest, but now is absolutely the worst possible time to do it, and in some cases it turned from peaceful to outright barbaric, what I despise)

The last 3 surprised me, how can you have such big balls to claim entire countries
Yes, but South and North Korea are kinda understandable, since they are technically still at war, and even in the case of Taiwan, it was once párt of China, unlike the entirety of Kazakhstan
Good on ya neightbour
Maybe once you finally pass us we can start upping our game as well
We also have great GDP growth, sadly, only in our own currency
Some would say it's just inflation, but those are bad people
Somewhat related: I remember when the Hungarian govermant was battling with Google maps whether it should let them scan us for StreetView or not, while some romanian company (Norc
) just came in, scanned us and got the fuck out, I remember using them before StreetView :D
I like that this isn't like a big art stunt
This has meaning and thought to it
If you look closely the first two and the second two collums are both in alphabetical arrangement, so I suppose it has all of the names who died from the village in the WW1 and WW2
Not an uncommon name, Gulyás in Hungarian means a person who took care of cattle, as in the occupation, not just the food gulyás, which comes from that term
According to the Hungarian site another user linked it was erected in 2014
So your suspicions were right
Horvát/Horváth is one of the most common family names in Hungary
Its the Hungarian equivalent of Smith or Jones
Russians: u sure
The chance of me committing hate crimes with my car is a bit smaller tho

This city made me understand what acrophobia feels like
Ironic how "ronda" means ugly in Hungarian
ígazán Ronda
Sorry, I misspelled acrophobia
But yeah, sometimes looking up to tall buildings makes me dizzy too
(texas drawl) THat's we're growing our foootballs, but the wind brought in summat from Mexico so now they'll all roundish(/texas drawl)
Some good starting advice would be to gain more than 7% of the country's support when protesting
Ah, so this is funded by the Open Society Foundation
Got it, same thing that happened here

...yes
Money in taxes is always - at least partially - going to end up in corrupt politician's pockets
Only difference is that you wont hear news about it, if it happens in the west
Berlins Brandenburg airport still not being finished after 2011 start of the project
With multiple cost overruns dodgy worksmanship, and delays
Before COVID start the building was declared completed, only to be found to be a complete fire hazard, not only missing sensors, but not complying with fire code on other points - for a start, and thats not all of the issues
Or how Merkels party managed to not phase out coal plants, instead fire moreup, to make sure germany isnt carbon neutral, despite its growing renewable energy sector
Making news about corrupt, immoral, shitty, europoor east is the perfect way for your local representative to point your attention away from his/her own scandals
(Similarly to how Soros conspiracy theorists are the same thing for Orban)
Yeah corruption doesnt exist in Germany
...the overruns, late finish, half assed jobs on Berlin's Brandenburg airport were clearly not due to theft & corruption
Its due to Chinese cyber warfare
Allow me to be a bit sceptical
When a project thats plagued with cost overruns, shoddy worksmanship, and the like is opened during the middle of COVID, when none cares
It like that Lilum E-jet that "mysteriously" caught fire during COVID when news had no time to report on their scam - after being unable to deliver the impossible prodcut they promised
There is a saying that 1st case is incompetence, second is sabotage, 3rd is enemy action
That airport edges very close to the enemy action territory
Which makes the "its incompoetence, noone is corrupt here" a bit hard to believe
[Orbán - How to cook Easter ham]

I wouldn't be shocked if Hungary recognize it in some form
Orbán is mad enough to do it, and we have our own fight for autonomy in Romania
Now it's only a matter of ti
aaaand Germany is fascist again
This picture makes me uncomfortable
huh, so hungarian is the only language with Ő and Ű, interesting never knew that
German does have ö. Just because it says: ä --yes--> ö --yes--> eesti keel ö --no--> ß --yes--> German
We have á too
If it looks like fish speak, its romanian, thats how I recognize it

I often hear the argument that: we shouldn't take these statues down because they are part of history
I hate to come with this example but
Hitler was a part of history
Would you like to see statues of him as well
We should build statues of figures of examples, not just any historical figure that had a big impact
There's many other ways to remember and learn about those
As a hungarian: is it possible to learn this ability

Everyone from hungary : Perhaps, peac is an option
99 years have passed, Ukraine is still occupying territory in Hungary
No, they wouldn't stop selling their stuff in the Netherlands, they have a lootboxless version of their games for Belgium, so they can just make that available there
I see you have texture issues, hoping the hotfix drops soon
this guy taxes
Same would go for Hungarian too (more or less)
Looking at the other replies, maybe it is the anglophones who are strange and never say what they mean
Not a dutch, but for hungarians this is all true
In my opinion genders are an outdated concepts in languages, as there are subtle differences in male vs
female denotation in German and French for example
And if you are getting proficient in both languages you have to keep all of this in mind
(And it is especially hard for you if neither of them is a mother tongue for you and you are translating between them
) I know that the genders can be traced back to Ancient Greek (and now thats a hard language with all those kind of tenses and genders
) but often I find them obsolete with all those exceptions anyway
(And we don't even get into the modern transgenderism problems here
Finnish/Uralic languages even have a kind different concept of tenses (at least speaking of Hungarian, but I might be ask a Finnish friend) and they are usually more descriptive versus the indo-european languages (where subtle denotations are made by the genders for example)
And I assume you make mistakes from time to time, after a decade of speaking that language
I do

Sorry, I'm 6 hours late, is it still URGENT
So what happens if CSTO is invoked
Would NATO do anything
> Would NATO do anything
Tbh NATO seems to only exist in name these days
I don't think they'll ever do anything big in the future other than disband
Clearly nobody wans to get involved in distant conflicts with no benefits to them
*ne*
What I meant was, unless it's an actual Russian invasion of a memberstate I don't think NATO would ever fulfill any serious obligation in the future
And it'll certainly stay out of anything to do with Turkey
To me it seems like the interests of member states and the threats they face have changed a lot since the organization was founded, and most members are far from fully commited now
Which is why I'm not sure if the organization has a future
It's become too fragmented and afraid of a real fight
yea it was not, that's why actual socialists rebelled against the soviets and led uprisings throughout the eastern bloc in these years
well yea, soviets went after actual communists in these years so it shouldn't be too controversial to say they were not real communists
You're spreading western propaganda, the Soviets were actually delivering free stuff to help the people
What are you saying here
Was the Rogue Khmer "real communism" or not according to you
They were publicly supported by the US and a good part of western commies did not support them at all
Maybe some western socialists are supporting China now, but they're idiots too and are not real communists either
What's going on in China is literally capitalism on steroids
Communism has a meaning that should be clear to anyone who has ever read any Marx
It's not a system of government, but a workers movement to topple capitalist conditions
It's protesters / strikers / revolutionaries who are communists, not governments
So your objection is that *some* western people supported the Khmers (while most did not or just ignored them) who later recalled their position when it was apparent that it's retarded and it turned out that the Khmers have nothing to do with communism
It looks like your problem is not with communism, but with some people who call themselves communists
That concern I share too
Communism has an invariant meaning since at least the middle of the 19th century
You can only meaningfully criticize it, if you know what it means
>After all, Pol Pot was educated in Europe by said "real communists" and returned to Cambodia to fulfill the "real communism".
Well, he was an idiot too: "Sâr (Pol Pot) found many of Karl Marx's denser texts difficult, later saying he "didn't really understand" them
" lmao
I am a Marxist, not a tankie and I am not Western from the POV you're talking about
Even if there would've been a large majority of Khmer supporter "commies" on the west (I'd love to see some reliable source on that), how would that change the fact that the Khmers actions did not align with communism
Do you agree, that your problem is not with communism, but with alleged communists from the West in the 70's?

Charts like the one above are much better for propaganda
So, do we get back Transylvania or nah
What I see in the middle is the German Empire and the Monarchy
As a Hungarian, us being regarded as central as opposed to eastern feels so nice for some reason
I like how they just went with "Southeastern Europe" when everyone knows they meant "The Balkans"
Also the border between Central and Western Europe should be drawn straight through Belgium
Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania
All four of those are Eastern European countries
yup, in almost every major city in Hungary the main squares are pretty much the same

EDIT: And there is that half - two seconds (depending on overall sense of humor, usually none) between the realisation that I come from Hungary and the "joke". That is the time period in which we can prepare for the oncoming "joke".

Sending my warmest regards to our Finn cousins as a Hungarian
We are thought about the Kalevala in primary school and up until the recent rage in politics it's been thought that our languages are related to each other, although got separate from the common ancestor(s) like 5000 years ago
To me and to many, many other Hungarian Finnish sounds like our language from a distance and that similarity is thrilling
I find Finnish sounding very endearing, playful and always make me smile when I hear it on very rare occasions
God bless the Finns

I'd love to experience it
Unlike almost all other European languages, we don't belong in the Indo-European language family, sharing the Finno-Ugric family with the Finns, the Estonians and some extremely small Uralic languages

If state report, then note that in many countries even Christians identify themselves officially as non-christians, otherwise they're forced to pay additional church taxes (no matter if they're practicing, if they belong to some other community etc)
Just a nice rhetoric, most of the people I know (even older ones) don't attend churches and couldn't care/know less about Christian stuff

"Kurva" is not bad for Hungary, but I would rather nominate "bazmeg" and its affiliates
What about Russia
Why are they left out
The only thing this map was supposed to do, it failed at
In hungarian kurva is not common
Baszd meg
(\~fuck it) is common
However its also not the most harsh of our cursing, not by a long shot
We have things along the lines of:
*  "A kurva isten verje bele a rákos faszát!" = "The bitch/prostitute god should beat his cancerous dick into this (thing/situation)
* Basznád teherbe a jó kurva anyádat
" = "Fuck your well used prostitute mother pregnant
* "Vitt volna el a rézfaszú bagoly
" = "You should have been taken by the owl with the copper dick
" - owl refers to medical doctor, and the copper dick refers to abortion instruments, the whole thing is an archaic way of saying your mother should have aborted you
Those are just the classic ones, you can find more at r/szopjatokle (=r/suckmeoff)
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Including gems like:
* "Elon Musk wants to implant chips into peoples brains

* Your brother in law alex tells that your pussy should rot and fall out of your body
* If i had 5 pussies, even then i woildnt let you into one if them
* All the dogs who suck Orban's dick should fall dead one by one
you shoudl lick his pussy until suffocate in his shit, you dogs
ALL of you, you retarded sellout jizz
...i am sure you all have pedophile leanings, beat my dick into it
Kurva is just the tip of the Hungarian swearing iceberg
In hungary you wouldn't say kurva as an exclamation, it would be more like basszameg/baszki/bazmeg/etc
Those are almost all different words, "fuck" for England but "whore" for Hungary
I'd argue that in Hungary "baszd meg" is more important

If we want to use kurva, there's also "A KURVA ANYÁDAT" (yes, all caps is mandatory) which roughly translates to "your whore mother".
This is also inaccurate
The main feature of the Hungarian language is the ability to invent and infinitely chain together curse words similarly to writing a poem
GECI
Too
ló fasz is another decent one, translates to horse cock and can be used very creatively lol
Had to scroll too much to find this
Nah i use kurva as a word by it self
You can also chain swear words almost infinitely, like a combo
OP is upset in their comment history about the waiting times on GTAOnline because of Russian players
Yep, you cannot single out one curseword from the infinity of hungarian cussing
Depends on the context
It could simply mean "period" (as in end of sentence) when you're really angry
JK of course it's a ~~course~~ curse word, it literally means "fuck [something/someone]".
I smiled really wide reading your comment because I can very clearly imagine the situation where your ancestors learned the word from Hungarian guys trying to make a broken machine work well and cursing the entire time, and concluded it must be a name for the machine
The word exists and is in use, but it just means whore, applied to either actual prostitutes or just generally to women you hate and want to offend
It's not widely used as the general curse word *fuck* like in Polish and I suppose in other Slavic languages
Lófaszt
Sadly as previously mentioned in situations where polish people use KURWWWA hungarians say BAAAAZDMEG
"Kurva" means "whore" in hungarian so it's used only in sentences like "a jó kurva isten basszon meg a retkes faszával the gennyes rohadék" and such poetic constructions
That's so mild I even heard it on a kiddie playground
Let me join this contest with a classic
Author unknown, usually attributed to linguist László Grétsy but he alleged that it's not his piece of art
>Fiatal lány enyeleg fiatal fiúval
A háttérben figyeli őket a fiú egyik barátja
Mihelyst a lány egy pillanatra eltávozik, a két fiú között a következő párbeszéd alakul ki:
>– *Baszod*, mi
>– Á!
>– *Át akarsz baszni*, mi
>– Ne *basztass* már! *Basznám*, *baszod*, de *rábasztam*: *baszik* *baszni*, *baszd meg*!
>– Ez *bebaszott*!
>– Ezt *kibaszottul* *elbasztam*! *Bassza meg*!
A complete conversation using various form of a single verb only (baszni, to fuck), but using it 13 times giving it 11 different meanings
Translation below, I tried to use forms of *fuck* wherever I could but I missed two of them (highlighted in bold)
>A girl is on a date with a guy
The guy's friend is watching in the background
When the girl leaves the scene for a moment, the boys engage in the following conversation:
>– You're fucking her, ain't you
>– Nope
>– You're **lying to me**, ain't you
>– Stop fucking with me
I would fuck her, fuck you, but I fucked up: she **won't** fuck me, fuck you
>– This is fucked
>– I fucked up so fucking much
Fuck it

Learned this a couple of years ago here on reddit and i'm still amused
So its like the word huncut in hungarian, which is mostly used to describe impish, miscivous (but good natured) kids
The word started its life as hundefotze (dogs vagina), used by austrian soldiers to describe prostitutes
"franc" actually means/used to mean syphilis, and as you might know as a Franc (I just found out) people used to call it French disease, because you kinky fucks started the whole thing apparently
And it remained in the language as an actual curse word and now a cuss word
Just don't take it personally
If that's any better we actually say francia when we're referring to anything French now, while the word franc does not directly relate to your nationality anymore
Így már annyira azért nem is szomorú :)
Mi sose voltunk olyan jelentős nép, hogy lehessen

We have the replica of this Castle In Budapest, one of the best looking Hungarian castles ever
Szevasz
Ctrl C - Ctrl V in Budapest
Szöröstalpúak belopták a várunk
Fuck you for stealing our castle
It’s the Hunyadi family, Hunyadi János who erected this castle was regent of Hungary, later his son Mátyás/Matthias was king of Hungary
Black Army time
Ezt az eredetit is mi építettük
Szevasz
Says the Romanian nationalist
Tudom én, de okkal nem Vajdahunyad Vára névvel posztolja ki, kompenzál valamit én úgy érzem
Tudjuk, nem tűnt még föl hogy amiket ezek posztolnak azokat az esetek felében mi építettük?
No, Hunyadi János Hungarian regent built this in the 1500s, its an important Hungarian cultural site so it was remade in Budapest for the 1001 year anniversary of the Hungarian kingdom
[Here is the story of the one in Budapest ]
The anglo saxons, the romanians and everyone who made that treaty
Dyslexic kingdoms
Szerintem tudjuk kik, most itt feleslegesnek érzem, hogy kirobbantsunk egy ilyen vitát, csak downvoteolnának a picsába és ennyi
That wasn’t the message I got from your first comment
Who told you I am mad
It only gets annoying when Romanians start claiming Mátyás Király, like he existed before nations had an identity, was a Hungarian king and was born in Kolozsvár and spoke Hungarian, he probably had Romanian ancestors but claiming him is a stretch
But we are talking about this one, and this one was erected by Hungarians
>	is not like half of the noble famillies from Transylvania have romanian/pechen/cuman/slavic origins
Yeah, it’s not like that as you said
Kendeffy:
And yes Dagffy apperently did have olah ancestors on one side, but I don’t really see the point
So you managed to point out two of thousands, one of which wasn’t even true
We just pointed out that whenever there is a pic about “beautiful Romania” it’s alway a pic about a Transylvanian city center built by us in the 19th century, and old town built by us or the saxons, or an old castle built by us in the middle ages passed off as Romanian
achievements
Which is fine you do you, just don’t act so offended when we point that out
Most of them speak Hungarian, and that’s their mother tongue
What’s your point
No one claims that, we known that Transylvania was and is diverse
Yes, no one cared about what nationality are you in 1500s so trying to claim this castle is dumb
I meant that it was ordered to be built by a Hungarian my bad
Just because there were Hungarian engineers at the building of the Suez Canal I don’t claim it’s partly a Hungarian achievement
The same way just because Temesvár bordered vlach regions it doesn’t mean they had anything to do with it, the same line of thought would led to me say Vienna is a partly Hungarian achievement
As for the Austrian part, even during those times Hungary had significant autonomy, with different laws and legislature from
the rest of the empire
But if we argue about semantics anything before 18th is not a Romanian achievement, because it didn’t exist yet
And all those places were built by Hungarians nobility
As for the family, you say official sources are not true regarding the family tree because they are Hungarian but a wikipedia page without any sources is the ultimate truth
Also you try to force on mediaval places the ethnographic map of Transylvania after Maria-Theresia and her invited Romanian settlers
Either way this whole discussion is not really worth my time, given 4th is coming soon we will have a lot of debates about it anyways
Clearly misunderstood my statement, I never said that ancestry doesn’t count, I said that it does not matter, if I’m born in France but I speak German follow German traditions and German is my mother tongue and i have German citizenship am I French
They know that, but just like everyone else from Eastern Europe, when they get defensive they resort to nationalism
Both Romanians and Hungarians
Ask the Székelys if they are Hungarians/Székelys or Romanians the answer won’t shock you
To be honest I wish I knew the answer
A civil conversation between Romanians and Hungarians
Impossible
Oh you are one nationalist idiot
Székelyföld is and was Hungarian majority since Hungarians arrived in the 800s
still has around a million Hungarians living there
[Umm what
Check the map where it describes the population
Edit: Im shit at maths
I made a mistake when adding up, how is that spewing Fidesz propaganda when I’m like the majority in Hungary is anti-Orbán
You are a huge idiot
Orbán altered the constitution he won majority in the parliament but more people voted against him, and despite that Fidesz lost the last major election, the opposition won Budapest a major blow to Fidesz and Orbán. You never made a mistake when looking at counties and accidently added one to the bunch when counting something, fuck off man
How am I an ultranationalist when you say thing like the Hungarians in Romania were given too much rights
Dude come one don’t even try to paint me as such when you meet their characteristics
Why should they show respect after 50 years of oppression
And yes after typing that shit down call me a nationalist again
That’s the reason why they protested in 1990 so that doesn’t seem right
Ceacuescu did some ethnic cleansing as well, and took away their autonomy
Hungary had to reach out to then OSCE because of constant human right violations and the mistreatment of the Hungarians in Romania, a country behind the Iron Curtain appealed, how bad is must have been

You are a Romanian for sure
And no, it wasn’t wiped out, it was broken into three pieces, one that was the Ottoman’s, the other was the Hapsburg’s, and the last one Transylvania
In 1699 it got reunited under the control of the Hapsburgs which later on became the Austro-Hungarian empire, which then broke up and Hungary got chopped to pieces, and Romanians were happy because they got to take 1/3 of Hungary’s land
And ever since spread lies about the whole situation the end
I await your reply where you call me a liar and bring up a lot of fake made up things that Romanians thought of to make it look like it wasn’t Hungarian anymore
Cheers
Buuuurn
You’re are so full of shit, Romanians did nothing in 1848 and were neither with or against it
Y’all were pathetic nobodies with nothing then so wtf are you going on about bitch
And during the Austro-Hungarian empire we OWNED your pathetic asses as the Hapsburgs gave Transylvania to Hungary, it really didn’t matter for them because either way they rules above it
I would say more but your bitch ass wont care so fuck it
Go on and believe your lies
Why do you even have to argue
You came out victorious, got the land, why make up lies that you rightfully got it
Lmfao
This is gold

Also, the EU zone is not homogeneous enough - and by that I don't only mean the fiscal policies
Theoretocally, if the labour force was more mobile etc, the EU zone could work perfectly, balancing out the internal differences (See the optimal currency theory:
And many of these criteria are not satisfied in the area, thus the internal differences cannot be resolved
One example is, that in the periphery even with lower prices, you can't benefit enough from your competitive advantage, bc the Germans just don't speng enough, create huge savings, instead of buying exports from you
Such structural problems thwart catching up
One idea is that first these descrepancies should be resolved, before joining the EU zone

What does underpay mean
They don't pay them the western wage
Just because they get small amount of money, it can be good in China, otherwise there would be no workers there
Mercedes and Audi also "underpay" Hungarian workers, because it is nowhere near western wage
Should these two and other offshored companies disappear as well
It is very likely
However still a lot of people choose Foxconn in China, and the reason is the pay is higher or something is more favourable for Chinese people over other companies
I have worked for one summer in a UK holiday park as a cleaner
It was horrible, I can't believe how bad the working conditions were
However me and other people from Hungary, Poland and Lithuania went there willingly because it was compensated by a lot of money (UK min wage)
I have worked in EY (financial audit) in Hungary
It was again horrible
It was not only horrible, but illegal what they did according to Hungarian law
I still worked there, because I got some valuable experience and a good salary compared to my lack of accounting knowledge
(now finally I am not overworked in a nice company, but I would not be here without EY experience)
Foxconn workers have a right to work in other companies
They choose Foxconn because the others are even shittier

Two contrasting graphs that are apparently for comparison but one has a light-to-dark gradient to show increasing frequency and the other has the opposite dark-to-light gradient
Horrendous design
Maybe, but since the values basically don’t overlap, and for all intents and purposes you have a green map and a red map,  it makes the two “backwards” from each other
It breaks the convention that we have all come to expect where gradient equals value with darker meaning more

As a serious question, if I travel to the US and visit their website, the law still applies to them
I'm still an EU citizen, and they still have to fulfill my request at providing me the data they have on me, and the right to delete all of that data
Same if I browse via VPN
Right
The law is based on either residency or citizenship it seems
"**DO NON-EU BASED ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO COMPLY TO THE GDPR
If they process data or sell goods to EU citizens or have EU citizens as employees then yes, they need to comply
When talking about the need to comply to the GDPR, it all comes down to the individuals whose data you are processing
Whether you are selling goods, processing their data when they create an account on your website, or employing someone, if any of the people you work with is a EU citizen, the GDPR applies to you
" - eugdprcompliant
com
And as far as I've dug up things (during our own company's GDPR research) the EU legal structure allows you to move muscle on foreign companies, but as there is no precedent on how it actually can go down, it's something we'll see later
But yeah, to me it seems that just blocking EU IPs is only a temporary band-aid
As with many things in GDPR, intent is what matters in the end

I'd rather choose that instead of a dozen pop up on each web site
I'm supposed to be mad or something, but it's actually quite accurate lmao
Don't worry: we, Hungarians absolutely hate our gov't
The hungarians would cut that out like last time
Iam proud
As a Hungarian, this situation deeply concerns me
Aww
at this point just kick us out
I guess I'm OOTL, what did the dipshits of my country (Hungary) do this time
Sadly the propaganda is already using it to show how bad the EU is
I hope we can get rid of them on the next election but that would be a miracle
and we can't do anything about it sadly
Also it’s hard to topple the Orbán regime when half the current opposition was/is in the party that nearly bankrupted the country 12 years ago
Please don't feel ashamed
These are never for you
Or me
These cartoons is always about the leaders, not about the people
I'm sure the artist knows that a huge number of Polish and Hungarians does not like their governments
But you can't fit that in a cartoon like this
Good luck bud

>I hope we can get rid of them on the next election but that would be a miracle
Well the opposition always does a perfect job of looking at best as trustworthy as Orban
We have alternatives like "Kurcsány"\_Ferenc
party, the guys who think that puppet regime installed at gunpoint by waffen SS was an utopia, our greentards who shown multiple times that they want to replace nuclear with fossil fuel in the middle of climate crysis
...frankly the two-tailed dog (joke) party is the LEAST insane option
It just feels so stupid, boot the fuckers and we actually have a chance to elect someone better
My mother voted FIDESZ for 10 years because how she hates Gyurcsány specifically
You're not Hungarian
How would you know, why our system is bad
Describing this to foreigners is difficult
But to give you an example: what you see here, as the topic of this post, is currently used by our government as propaganda, to show us how bad the EU is the members of the EU are oppressors, and they want to silence our politicians and we should hate them as the UK did
Yo it was a joke
I hate redditors they are always so cold and agressive
Why are you telling yourself to shut the fuck up

Considering how the current goverment can probably sense their end, I don't even want to know what disgusting tactics they'll use when elections begin
He does not have 50%, it's fourty-something percent
Imagine getting informed by a random reddit comment
Sorry i'm not too familiar with politics, if they fuck up i keep note but usually i don't bother with politics
Well, i'll have to vote next elections so i gotta eventually
I do remembet however, that this whole controversy was around last elections where he supposedly received 2/3 of votes despite more than 50% of the population not voting for him, thus demanding a recount
That's when this was found out
Sorry i couldnt be much of help, hopefully other fellow redditors can give more insight
Yes, it was with bags of potatoes
Exactly, though afaik they're planning on uniting for the next elections to dethrone fidesz
Yep, these next 2 years are gonna be tough
but I guess whoever is willing to fix education, healthcare etc the most will receive the most votes
I do hope we get to pick the best of the good parties and not the least awful from the worst

I think the Hungarian one is realistic, I agree
>The truth is that those rural areas were never forgotten, urbanization is the future
Centralised agriculture doesn't work, you can't drive the machinery from the nearest city to the edge of the country every day
The current state of urbanisation is already barely sustainable, housing crisis, wage gaps, modern slavery etc
I don't know why you think it's the future
Science fiction megapolises never mention how services are handled or who supplies them
Well, 60% in Poland is urban, 54 in Romania, 77 in Germany
Hungary is 71%. I don't think you want to go down this route
In Hungary, there's less and less people willing to work in agriculture and full automation is still far away
The eastern half of the country is depopulating at an alarming rate
If this goes on, and it will, because lack of population->lack of businesses->lack of jobs->lack of demand->lack of businesses
It drives itself after a critical point which Hungary already reached and it's freaking hard to turn back
And if you narrow it down to a village it's 0%. The regions aren't physically separated and there's no language barrier so there's no reason to do parallel statistics
> Demographics of Poland are more complicated than simple average 60% degree of urbanization
It was your argument that you need a higher percent
I said it's a trap
People need liveable towns, not large cities

I don't see straight-up fans of EU here often (even if you're disappointed in this post) so let me grab this opportunity to ask what is that you still like about it today
Things like Schengen/freedom of work/legal harmonization - while hard topics - are things that any reasonable alliance can achieve fast
Trophy bills like GDPR are neat, but are drop in the ocean in the long run
Huge difference between member states, ignorance to do anything about it, endless naivity of the founders, shallow agreements as a result, and the general fear of falling apart (and thus supporting outright autocracies) made EU a weak, anguished entity destined to fall
As a federalist, I see EU as the greatest obstacle towards it
Well, he is a member of Fidesz, so it was expected
What I find strange, is that there aren't any news in Hungary mentioning the vote
(Probably because almost all news sites are controlled by Fidesz)
I can tell you guy a little secret about fast Eastern European internet
ISPs were owned by western parent companies for a long time, and they wanted western level subscription fees
Then a few domestic ISPs emerged, bought cheap Chinese equipment (ZTE/Huawei), used road side poles for fiber and suddenly everyone had 1Gbps at home
You will run ADSL as long as that "return of investment" stuff is not done on the Siemens boxes
The data isn't really comparable
The US has 50k reported cases the EU has 82k. But the CDC paper gives an estimate:
> Accounting for underdiagnosis, Salmonella causes an estimated 1
2 million illnesses annually in the United States, approximately 1 million of which are transmitted by food consumed in the United States
Which means the reporting rate isn't exactly high
It's not cases reported to doctors, it's cases reported to FoodNet and ECDC
Without knowing the reporting rate, comparing the two is meaningless
This is the mountain on Toblerone, right

What if they never had it to begin with
I’m not saying we had it all along but from the 10th century to the 16th (Turkish stuff) we had it conquered and under control
From there I don’t argue since it gets way too complicated
Conquered in the 10th century, yes
But isn’t that long enough ago to get to keep and say we’ve had it more is the question
I don’t care though I like Hungary right now too and I’d like it bigger as well, doesn’t matter for me
Ok this thread is weird, usually it’s just the “never had it and never should’ve” stuff I hear, then I get irrationally angry but then I also remember I have a large amount of Romanian in me along with a few others, man it gets confusing looking at the Romania Hungary dispute
i have never heard about san marino, where is it
Same with Hungarian
Only you bump into Hungarians wherever you go
Reminds me of [this] video
I like how the german is just sitting there in his suit, like:
„Can we get this over with
I have to go the bank
The roma one ofc
Why exactly
They are still different ethnic groups
Romania is doing the same to the Hungarians what Hungary did 100 years ago to the Romanians
Be a bigger man
Break the cycle
Hate all people

I mean the way you speak about Hungarians I wouldn’t want to learn Romanian either, if I would live there
Imagine having Transylvania and somehow still being this salty about it
Great underdog narrative there, mate

This is extremely common in central-eastern Europe, I live in Hungary and we did this until the early 00s, and still have the system installed as a backup

I figured there could be a bigger version, so I right-clicked the image in Chrome and hit "Search Google for this image". It brings up a page with "Find other sizes of this image: All sizes - Medium - Large" and I clicked Large
This is a really amazing feature of Google, it tracks images and knows which are scaled versions of each other
Never understood why a country would not extradite their citizens, when the supposed crime is a crime in their own country as well, and getting a fair trial is assured
If I know that a fellow citizen is indicted for a crime I would want them to either clear their name or bear the consequences of their actions, regardless where they did or what they did
The person in question is a German-Polish dual citizen, not a migrant
Why would Switzerland try a crime that happened in a different country
And how
I am fairly certain they would not have the witnesses travel around the world for the trial
Hell, likely the courts wouldn't even entertain them, because the Swiss authorities do not have standing in a case related to a completely different country not under their jurisdiction
There was supposed to be a big change after the end of the Soviet Union

Okey guys, time to move to Austria
Maybe we can survive this summer there
Damn UK, how you holding up
r/unexpectedspanishinquisition
I kind of understand why people from the UK don't really learn a foreign language, English is one of the major languages, people learning foreign languages usually learn that
For example: there are many people in their mid-late 20s here, in Hungary who don't speak a foreign language well or at all
Lately universities required language certificates for graduation, now it requires for admission too, that makes a bit more people learn a foreign language
Damn, the fucking Romanians beat us again
rule britannia
They asked erasmus students didnt they, because this in no way reflects reality
I saw hungary and was like damn thats cool then i scrolled down
In hungary its english sometimes german
Reasons for Hungary could include: huge preference for dubbed TV/movies, historical language reform movements, the difficulty of integrating foreign words into our language because of suffixes/prefixxes, very different vowel/consonant sounds from english, formerly part of te ~~USSR~~ eastern bloc, low income cizizens can't afford to travel, english classes in elementary/high school are 90% in hungarian except for vocab/reading (doesn't teach you to actually practical use)
in hungary everything is dubbed from operating systems, movies, even the least known ones
You can avoid any foreign language completely, like a russia or china
For older hungarians it's german, younger ones (after the communism collapse) english (no surprise)
As a lot of hungarians moved here from the neighbouring countries there are a lot of folks who speak one of the neighbouring languages - ukrainian/russian, serb, croatian, romanian, slovakian
One by one those languages are not much, but as around a million people immigrated, taken together it must be a lot
> english classes in elementary/high school are 90% in hungarian
Wait, you mean they don't teach it the same way in other countries
I mean, teaching any foreign language in said language when the students don't yet possess sufficient grammatical and/or vocabulary knowledge doesn't sound very practical to me
about half a million Hungarians live in Slovakia a lot of whom I suspect are bilingual, also you shouldn't take my opinions for granted nor should you the article
it's just mentioned, ofc it's not the biggest part of it
The other reasons (like english classes being hungarian basically) are why we are so shit
yea that should be the norm, but what we're talking about here is that some english lessons go by without speaking any english
Like the best student will answer every question, the others would just hang on their phones
I also witnessed some oral presentations where the guy spoke hungarian and the teacher translated it for him
At this point I actually can't fucking believe this
It just became a competition, I can't wait to see the next one

You've got a couple of misleading facts there:
ASTRA founded a network of libraries, not schools, and it's founding members came from Transylvania, not the Kingdom of Romania
In fact, its first president was born in Miskolc, a city in northeastern Hungary
It is true that magyarization policies had a negative effect on minority-language education, however Transylvania still had more Romanian-language schools in 1918 than the Kingdom of Romania despite having one third the population (of Romanians)

The second Proto-Uralic origin of the Hungarian one refers to the word "month" as "hó, hónap"
But the first one seems correct
"from proto-Uralic: kume" --> hó
just hungarian things
Hungarian is such a beautifully stupid language
Persze hogy narancssárgák lettünk lol
No, because "hó" and "ho" don't sound the same
To your eyes it might as well be, but to us it can be a huge difference
For example: *kurta* means 'curt', while *kúrta* '(he or she) shagged'.
Languages are fun
And "kar" means "arm" in Hungarian
And 'arm' in Hungarian
Huh, 'kár' means dick in Hungarian and comes from the Roma language
Maybe related
Please treat the burnt areas immediately
It is h**ó**, not ~~ho~~.
It is similar to Samoyed *chav* "upper hard part of snow"
* In the root part *m* đ *v* happened (just like in the word "attic": Finnish *komo*/*komi*, Khanty *kom* that in Hungarian became *hiu*)
* Also, *k* đ *h* happened according to a regular rule (as in the word "fish": Mansi *kul*, Mordvin *kal*, Finnish, Estonian *kala*, Samoyed *halle* that in Hungarian became *hal*)
That's pretty neat because "hó" is also originated from "moon" ("Hold" in Hungarian) the other part of it "nap" is either "sun" or "day" but I haven't looked it up yet
'Kar' is indeed arm in Hungarian, 'kár' on the other hand isn't
Wow, I didn't know hónap was from hold and nap, but actually it makes perfect sense, thanks
> Condom, the route is much safer
Hmm, you don't say
we have a similar river bus in Budapest also
always looks intriguing but never actually ridden in one though
Does this apply for the whole EU
Not sure about elsewhere but here in Hungary your money gets fucked by paying for taking out money from the ATMs, random fees taken off to "keep up" the bank card, etc
Looks like the climb to Alpental in Washington state during the summer
You can get far with Polish in hotels and restaurants
Looks like a messed up Cities skylines map

I wonder how old all the graffiti is
Imho the darkest fact is that our nation basically worships St
Stephen (aka
Stephen the 1st) who made the country recognized by forcing religious conversions
Which is why little to nothing of pre-christian hungarian culture remains
No diety names, no customs, no stories, no legends, a few fragments of runic script survived and thats it
Among other things its very unlikely tha Gerard Sagredo, aka Szent Gellért was murdered by a pagan mob without a cause
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
I would also add the 1985 Austrian MASS wine poisoning scandal, which is obscure
(Hopefully i get away with it thanks, common rulers)
Slavery is also common in Hungary, especially in rural areas
There are field and house slaves and everything
The area around the town of Szarvas is the worst, where many large farmsteads keep some slaves to do unpaid labor
The practice is known as "csicskáztatás", and the slave is known as a "csicska" (distinct from the Hungarian word for slave, "rabszolga")
[There's even a film about it
But it was a catholic one thus its fine
Not the only "dictatorship"
Hungaty is a democtratic dictatorship, the government somehow always get just 66% of the votes which is enough to basically change any law, only some exceltions like establishing a kingdom etc
They rigged the voting in favor of them
They sent out a questionnaire whit basically things like:
"The eu is forcing us to let immigrants in, etc" (so they lie) and then ask a question like:do you think we should protect the country more from corona
" Yes/no
Like the actual heck
But last year they fucked up big time, and lost nearly all the major cities
(So now they won like 90%of the mayor elections, but only 50% of the population with like 40% of the gdp)
So what did our "great and best" goverment do
Took away all the rights from the cities, but still blame them for everything
Then they established  "democtratic dictatorship" because of corona, not for a set amount of time, but for as long as they want it
Nah the idea is VERY old
Its even present in Plato's classics
Ofc, its not, however christianity gets a free pass at pretty much anything
Did you know that the pope excommunicated all members of the jury who sentenced the croatian arcbishop for war crimes
Well CIA supported every damned military coup that put more religion into the leadership of its "allies". Regardless what religion, or the atrocities commited, after all comunism had tobe beaten at ANY price
At least you didn have stuff like the nazi pedophile colony imported into south america to hava torturers
There is a slight difference between sweden and Germany
Among other things the swedish population was far less ardent and helpful in the execution of the genocide compared to the German one
And passivity causes far less suffering than waging a land war till you hit an ocean
&#x200B;
(Maybe it was because the Reich's population was subject to the propaganda longer, maybe for some other reason
At the end of the day its simply dishonest to equate all european states who didn't wage war against it, to the Reich)
>Under Stepinac's leadership, the bishops' conference released a letter condemning alleged Partisan war crimes in September 1945
The following year Stepinac was arrested and put on trial, which was perceived by some as a show trial
In October 1946, in its first special session for 75 years, the Vatican excommunicated Tito and the Yugoslav government for sentencing Stepinac to 16 years in prison on charges of assisting Ustaše terror and of supporting forced conversions of Serbs to Catholicism
Naturally the church had nothing to do with operating ratlines and giving asylum to ustase war criminals in vatican city
Nor was "brother satan", or that other franciscan monk who won the contest of most prisoners executed by knife (with 1360 victims) in any way shape or form related to the croatian catholic church let alone the vatican
&#x200B;
Sarcasm aside, this all falls perfectly in line with the modus operandi of abrahamic religions
Commit abhorrent crimes, then use the resulting outrage to claim religion is unjustly persecuted
Its going back to early years, like St
Boniface destroyinv the religious site of sacrdd groves of jupiter, the alexandria riots
And ofc

To OP:  "but Danish historians today agree that the agreement was most fair and that Hækkerup was not drunk"

Mohács
1956 revolution when the Soviet tanks arrived
The past 500 years
In 1505 our nobility agreed that we shall never have foreign kings ever again
20 years later we have our asses handed to us by the ottomans at the battle of Mohács and the Habsburgs quickly rush in to claim our throne
Meanwhile Transylvania broke off under John Zápolya and made an agreement with the Ottomans to become their vassal
We ended up with having our lands constantly ravaged for 150 years (yes even during peacetime as the rule of law didn't exist here for that time, and you could argue it doesn't ever since) and we spent half of our history under foreign rule because we fucked up that one time which ruined Hungary to the point that we're still trying to recover
Vlad was very hostile to the Transylvanian Saxons and their trade practices, which hurt Hungarian interests
It's no wonder he was thrown in cell after he lost his country, and the new Wallachian ruler, Radu III promised to restore the Saxon trading rights
Tfw you purposefully don't arrive to the battle with your army so that the Ottomans would kill the king and your noble friends elect you to be the new one
But then the Ottomans obliterate 1/3 of the country, Habsburgs yoink another 1/3 (and the crown) through some obscure rite of succession, and now you're on your own at war with the Ottoman AND the Habsburg empire
John Zápolya, master strategist ladies and gentlemen
Holy shit, who's the guy
I need to read more about this madlad
Who
The only pretender at the time was Radu and he was at the Turks, not the Saxons
A group with which the Saxons did have connection and common interests were the Boyars, who Vlad himself alienated with his policies, akin to the Saxons
Edit: I forgot about Basarab the Old as pretender, but he wasn't backed by the Saxons either
Edit2: I forgot Dan too
Damn, I need to reread my books
I'll correct myself in future comments
The Saxons of Brassó/Braşov expelled Dan in 1457 and dropped their support for them
It was Vlad III, who reignited the conflict, when he massacred settled Saxons from Brassó/Braşov within Wallachia in 1459
That's when the Saxons began to support Dan again, in retaliation
Basarab Laiotă only came into the picture first in early 1460, but yeah I was wrong about the Saxons not supporting him
I misremembered, since it wasn't the Saxons but the Turks, who ultimately got him on the throne afterall
In summary the exact conflict, which eventually led to Vlad III's imprisonment was initiated by Vlad III himself
> Yes but you cant claim he didnt have a casus beli
The Saxons didn't support any of the pretenders, when Vlad III started the conflict
They did on an earlier occassion, but not at the time
The bad blood was indeed already there though
> anyway isnt know for sure that the reason he was imprisonned was that one
That's true, that we can't know for sure, but it's speculated to be an important notion behind his imprisonment

Flair up
Nah, you just didn't say where you were from, so your comment was not understandable
Yes, when I was spending a lot of time with my English friends, in addition to watching and reading almost everything in English, I certainly felt I was getting worse at Hungarian
Lately though I speak a lot less English (still read and watch a lot of stuff in English though), and I find myself forgetting Hungarian words less and less
On the other hand, I'm not quite as confident at speaking in English as I was back then
Yes, sometimes i forget the words in my language and only know those words in english
I work with English and as a result I started to use English words even while talking in Hungarian
I cannot even talk about my work in my native language, due to the lingo used there
For me sometimes it happens yeah
Like I want to say a word but I forget the Hungarian version and the English form comes sooner into my mind
But I often just mix the two languages and use a half English half Hungarian sentence
We even have a word for it, it's called "Hunglish".
I don't mind it, it know it's not perfect
According to a Canadian and a Texan guy it's sometimes hard to understand because of the thick accent, but multiple French coworkers said that for them it's much easier than even other French people's accent
I don't, I always feel like I am reading english words out loud in my own language
Others can understand me but I feel like I'm not even speaking english
I dont like mine, i try to sound more British, but I cannot
Hungarians don't really have accents most people here just have shitty pronounciation
It is english but if a 3 year old spoke it
Yes, You could say that is an accent but it is not strong like russian or german (which actually sound good)
Also most of us don't use a translator and even if we do it's from like the 1800s.
People say  I speak english fluenty (not tryna flex here)
So no
We don't have accents
We just need to practice
I have a british accent, because I lived in England for a bit
So yes i absolutely love it
(am hungarian)
Edit: North-Yorkshire accent
I have an accent when speaking English (although probably not as bad as most other Hungarians), and a really obvious accent when speaking German (or French, but I use that really infrequently)
I don't really like or dislike it, but I consider my accent part of my identity
In Hungary’s case it definitely is the price of iPhones
Hungary has one of the biggest taxes on products in Europe and the world, 27%. If you think about it: a new iPhone is $1000
Now add $270 and then some extra profit, let’s say another $100
That’s around $1370 which many people can’t afford here
It may be even more if you buy it with a plan
Another thing is jealousy
There are people who love Androids for their own reason and there is no problem with that, but a lot of people hate iPhones because it’s “trendy” to hate them
Mostly because of their price
Ultimately the price is the key in Hungary’s case
I’m not sure about France or Germany
People here (atleast in my country) don't really like to spend more than 250 300 usd for a phone
Most will get one for 150 and that is it
Especially in eastern europe
Androids are also tougher and since many MANY people still work things that aren't in offices they won't break their phone
Also iphone customers here are mostly girls/women since iphones look girlier (most of them are white
)We don't buy the newest phone as soon as it comes out
Price / value is the problem - even if you can buy it why would you
Not to mention the questionable design philosophy of "it just works" by apple, which is used to justify removing features as "the main feature of our brand".
No headphone jack, because
We can use stronger material for the screen
lets make it thinner, instead more durable
Plus the image of walled garden is also stuck with the brand
Often leading to perceptionthat people with more money than sense are the main customers
One thing is to look at the design
Sure it has some problems
I personally like it, it’s my taste
I use an iPhone instead of a phone running on Android because of the system
I love iOS, it’s simple and I never had any problems with it
I’ve used Android before, it’s been unreliable for me
It was years ago so things probably changed but I don’t plan on switching back
So it’s worth it for me
Of course others will think otherwise it’s just my preference
Hungary is mostly Messenger as well, all of my friends use it, even for group chats
Viber used to be relatively popular here before they were bought by Rakuten
You have access to things like linux terminal
Sure apple is "clean", however lacking features is still not a feature imho
>many android manufacturers are following apple in doing so too
Many androide manufacturers follow apple no matter what
As this point - in product design - apple achieved a cult status, to the point where its actions are not to be questioned
&#x200B;
>Removing the headphone jack also frees up space that can be used for other hardware
And removing the jack doesn't mean that you can't use wired headphones, you just need to have an adapter (which comes in the box)
Yes, you can use headphones
Likely even with zero physical ports you can later on buy apple bloototh dongle that connets to phone/mac to offer ports
Still there currently its nothing short of making life harder for customers, who want to keep using their hardware
Sure you can use your headphone jack
Sure you can use USB
Its just not convenient
Yes, that is not AS bad as stopping you from using it completely
However its also not something i am willing to see as a "feature" something that makes me go "shut up and take my money", something that i am willing to fork more money over
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
I would happily pay extra for stuff like:
* its going to keep working if i abuse it, drop it, mishandle it
* standard wire connections to as much stuff as possible, for convenience, hell maybe even a cable routed around a phone's edge that folds out and can be plugged directly into mains
* large battery capacity - so phone works for a day, even when screen is on full brightness - yes, we have more efficient SOC, so the software in background puff on on very little power, however, not having to worry about phone dieing on you if you go fishing and browse ...etc
would be VERY welcome
* Using oled technology to package a large screen into a manageable form factor
* (useable) stylus integration
* camera that can be removed from the device, to take pictures from places where phone doesnt fit, and to allow using phone as a remote for the camera
* 360° camera when you have enough ensors on the damn thing for it
&#x200B;
Taking away features, because it was what Steve Jobs said people wanted is not something i am willing to pay extra for
[Természetesen Miskolc]
Debrecen
Just an overgrown village filled with fascist peasants

I worked as a tram driver as a part time job when I was attending the university
On my very first day (without supervision from an experienced tram driver), I accidentally changed the switch into the wrong direction, so I had to get off, and manually switch back with the so called "switch iron" which is a heavy rod
Not in Germany, because you guys have more modern stuff
For example, earlier there was the IBIS system, and I presume, nowadays there are other, even more sophisticated systems; but the thing is that the tram somehow "knows" on which route it's going (through GPS or other stuff), so it automatically changes the switches if necessary with radio control or other stuff
But Budapest (and other places in Eastern Europe) still has a system where there is a short, special section of the catenary like 30-50 meters before the switch
If the switch leads to the right direction, the driver has to roll under this short section without accelerating or taking any other current (the auxiliary systems are often also shut down during this if they consume too much), and the switch stays in the original direction, and it becomes locked, so a next tram wouldn't change it while the tram is still on it (thus the following tram must wait before going under this section of catenary until the previous has left the switch)
If it must change the switch, the tram must accelerate, and thus pick up current from the catenary
The system senses this, and changes the direction of the switch (and locks it, of course)
Sometimes you can fail, either you don't (or can't) change when you need to, or change the switch unnecessarily (like I did on my first day)
Hungary would be the guy who pretends he's doing the job really well, but actually does close to nothing, and everyone knows it

In Hungary, younger children use Uncle/Aunt Firstname for addressing teachers, while older children use Mr/Mrs Teacher
Also religious crazies don't get a free pass at whatever stupid they do in the rest of the world, because offending their feeling = communism

What it looks like it was intended to be is laicite
What you got is basically an excuse for christian churches, to have freedom of religion, not freedom from religion
Aka
you can pick a version of christianity that you like
However if you are not christian good luck getting your right, as it makes you de facto (even if not de jure) unable to hold office, "qualify" for aid - as most such things are operated to spread faith, not to aid poor ...etc
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
From the other side of the big pond it looks insane, when poor kids as soop kitchen operated by church tell that they pray, because thats how they get food
I find the fact that this can happen as morally repugnant as grainting sainthood to motehr theresa, or harboring war criminals the Waffen SS kicked out for excessive zeal by the vatican

Attila, Álmos, Árpád for males
Emese, Réka for females
These are from the times just before founding the Kingdom of Hungary (9th, 10th century)
Actually, they don't sound very archaic, because they are quite popular and widespread today as well, and Attila is world-famous because of the Hunnic ruler
EDIT: you could list several other examples, but I think there are two groups: there are old-Hungarian names generally used and not unusual; and there are some old-Hungarian names used by neo-pagans or chauvinists etc which are rather unusual
Funny enough, Eszter is the 8-14 most popular name for females in Hungary
Yeah, you can expand the list, I just wrote the most prominent examples

Not sure, I dont really see any Árpád's nowadays
Your name means "warlord" in Hungarian
I used to have two colleagues (from a group of 30) called Árpád (one of them quit), and have at least 5 other acquaintances called so
Szerintem a Töhötöm legalább a _Hannibál tanár úr_ óta diszkvalifikálta magát ebből a mezőnyből. :)
A Tason ingadoztam én is
Ignác is an old hungarian name as well
What does Germany think
I would bet that greens there see runaway greenhouse effet as favourable to nuclear power
After all one of them causes massive enviromenal issues, which means more issues the greens can solve
More popularity, more votes, more newspapres and online articles read
Its not a win-win situation, but its t least a win for greens
No, I just simply forget basic Hungarian words when I try to speak
I have learned english since i was 5 so i grew up with it
I watch so many stuff in english because there are not many videos that interest me in hungarian (my native language)
And yea, it often happens that i don't understand my native language for a few seconds
The Parliament
It's the most beautiful circus in the entire world
But seriously, a gorgeous building
Many inventions and discoveries have the hands of hungarian scientists in them, for example the computer, atomic bombs, and vitamin C.
We have a tradition of not clinking with beer
In 1849, the austrian officials clinked their cups of beer after every execution of the 13 hungarian generals of the fight for independence
This tradition would've lasted 150 years, which we're over, but you know, stayed a tradition, just like our borders from Trianon
You can clink it if you say "Vesszen Haynau
" (may Haynau perish), though, because Haynau was the croatian leader who ordered the execution of the generals and ordered the physical retaliations after
Our church bells ring every day at 12 o'clock
This tradition stems from the siege of Nándorfehérvár, in 1456
In support for the fight against the osmans, the popes ordered church bells to be ringed every noon while the fight lasted, and later kept ringing to protect the christian culture from islam invasion
We have a lot of thermal water underground across the entire country
And we build thermal spas over it whenever we find a new source
Hungary is the second oldest country in Europe, founded in 896
Hungary was the second country in the world to have a metro line
Hungary has an incredibly high number of hot springs, and under the capital is the largest geothermal cave system, made up of over 200 subterranean chambers
The largest synagogue in Europe is found in Budapest, the synagogue is also the third largest in the world
The hungarian alphabet (latin alphabet) has 44 letters, and has letters that consist of more than one characters
Bonus: The first reliable ball point pen was invented by László Bíró and Imre Gellért, patented in 1938
Hungary has the oldest metro in continental Europe and the second oldest in the world
The second largest synagogue in the world and the largest in Europe is the Dohány Street Synagogue in Budapest
Gyermekvasút (Children's railway) is a railway run by 4th, 5th and 6th grade children
All of the posts operated by children except the train driver
(Under of adult supervision of course)
We use eastern name order so we put our family name first (but we don't change the foreign name's order when we write or speak except for some historical names like John Calvin -> Kálvin János, Martin Luther -> Luther Márton)
You can't buy tobacco products in regular shops since 2013
There's special shops for them, called Nemzeti dohánybolt (National tobacco shop) and you can't even go to these shops if you are under 18
(At least officially)
The Oxford University is also older than the Aztec Empire
áéíóöőúüű cs dz dzs gy ly ny sz ty zs
These are all 1 letters
I would however advise to be cautious with the "hungarians invented everything" theories, as there is PLENTY of bogus floating around
...like hungarians inventing the helicopter, matchstick
etc
Budapest is literally the capital of thermal baths, it has the highest number of hot springs for a capital (123) and the highest number of thermal baths
Also our language is an island amongst other language families (Hungarian is Urallic - thus many language 'relatives' live in Russia, we are sandwiched between a Latin, a German and many Slavs)
Thus learning the language is quite difficult, but not THE hardest
Funnily enough our passport grants access to 163 countries, quite interesting when you compare the percentage of Hungarians that have been out of the Carpathian Basin
I wouldn't go as far as to call Tesla a scientist
He was  great man, nd many things, but scientist wasn't one of them
His work doesn't show even a slight resemblance of the scientific method
Why didn't we think of that
That's why I went with that wording, but the chances of a hungarian being involved in something abroad is pretty high when a couple
hundred
thousand goes out of the country because it's better than getting used to the incompetent leadership
Good question
What i meant is that the number of hungarian inventions are drastically inflated in opular culture, we both know that (or t least i hope)
&#x200B;
A good example would be Oszkar Asboth, who "invented the helcopter", in reality he made one more prototype that was completely uncontrollable without being tethered to the ground, to boost the long line of non-airworthy rotary wing aircraft like things
Similarly while János Iriny made significant contrbutions to matchstick, he didn't invent them, that was done in the 6th century, nor did he create the currently used variants
And despite popular misconceptions, Albert Szentgyörgyi didn't discover vitamin-c nor did he get a nobel prize for said discovery
He got his noble prize or his research on the biological effects of vitamin-c. Of course that is not good enough for hungarin exceptionalism
Similarly, while hungarian scientists worked on computers they did it faaar to late, to have any claims to inventing them
At best we could say that they formalized what constitues as a computer
Not to mention that the manhattan project was not even remotely close to exculsively manned by hungarians
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Thats without getting started on the crackpot theories that didn't even contain a grain of truth among the distortion, that tend to go alongside these
Anything from "Jesus was hungarian", "ancient sumerians were hungarians, because SOME of their city names are hungarian words" to "the dalai lama came to Hungary to visit the earth's heart chakra at the peak called Dobogókő" (\~Beatingheart, being a passable translation)
Death ray
Earthquake machines
Wild claims about transmitting electricity in all 3 dimensions from a tower, without the electromagnetic radiation getting spread thin and weak over the large volume
Tesla turbines being the best thing since butter
etc
As you said he was a "wonder-man", there were plenty of times where he stumbled on something golden
However he completely lacked scientific rigor, and made wildly unsubstantiated claims that fall more in line with the "snake oil sales man", than with "scientist".
We would say no, because we feel we can do anything (because we feel like some sort of survivals - our history is not pretty after 1526), but in the meantime we agree that our politics is a shitshow
Oh man bunch of things, here are a few in no particular order:
• George Soros is an evil mastermind behind everything that is “bad” in the world;
• EU = bad;
• Everyone = also bad (except for dictatorships, those guys are cool);
• Fidesz (the ruling party) is a benevolent entity bringing the people closer to God;
• Hungary is doing better than ever and a model country for the rest of the continent;
• Muslims are replacing the population of Europe;
• Refugees are constantly sieging our southern borders hence we need to be in a “state of war”;
• Socialism was the best thing ever and we should go back to the good ol’ times
Anything progressive is a conspiracy by Soros, illegal arab immigrants are flooding Europe, Brussels is restricting our countryrights, if we go with Europe Hungary will die, Russia is a lovely Country who wants to help Hungary preserve its sovereignity
Basically that everyone is against Hungary except China, Russia and the V4
Plus, that Hungary is doing great
That it will catch up with Austria in like 4 years
Basically, a bunch of bullshit
And they do it so people that can only look at the TV will be scared enough so Fidesz can get 2/3 of votes in all elections wich gives them free reign in the country
And they arent idiots
They shattered the opposition without banning them
Basically if all of the opposition got into one big coalition, even then they couldnt beat them
They believe in the current government
Orbán is stopping him for 4 years, the best enemy to fight is the one you make up
Wtf, they are saying that there too
I thought that only Hungary has to deal with this shit
Tito's still alive
SAS is the best airline, because it means "Eagle" in Hungarian
So everybody pronounces it as "shash" and not "es-a-es".
Obviously not everyone is like that, but I agree, it's bad
Due to the constant brainwashing of the government the general populace is downright hostile to foreigners
Thankfully the large majority understands (despite the neverending anti-EU propaganda the government is pushing) that it's beneficial to be in the EU
That's Orban's only message they haven't been able to push successfully
Not for their lack of trying though
And that we need to extend the fence to Croatia and Romania for safety
Thanks for clearing that up
Last time i watched Hungarian TV they still promoted Russia as a friend of Hungary when we made that agreement on that nuclear plant
I tought its only a hungarian problem
How do you feel an Orbán swap
For us it's not surprising due to his Hungarian origins, and I was kind of aware of the conspiracies around him but not on this scale
In Hungary, I'm talking about billboards, tv ads, and a constant barrage of newspaper articles talking about him
The government is not doing it anymore, (well the billboards at least) but just a few years ago, you couldn't take a step without Soros' face staring at you from somewhere
I don't know since we say "shash", but I thought you should say that since it's an abbreviation
Ask our shitty prime minister to stop it
Yep :)
Fuck
We had him for 9 years, it started to get boring
Don't you know someone who might fancy an Orban
I heard the Belgians don't have a government, maybe they would take him in
Millionaires associated with the Prime Minister
I don't think he is recycleble material
I don't know man, I was thinking about giving him away to an ex-minister shelter but I would rather give it to somewhere I know he won't make something stupid
China might take it as an act of war, I wouldn't risk it
Így sok nyelvtani különlegesség el fog veszni, de megpróbálom
Like this lot grammatical peculiarity away hold lose, but I try
Úgy tűnik, hogy az értelem is elveszett
Félek, ez nem könnyű.
Such it seems, that the meaning too away lost
I'm afraid this no easy
I think this (is) an interesting idea
Only that have to out find (I), that whatabout write (I should)
Yesterday went (I) gym (to the), then class (to) went (I)
Yeah, just as I thought, it looks terrible
Also it's very difficult to exactly copy the structure of Hungarian sentences to English
"Crackings the knuckleshis"
*megropogtatja az ujjait"
Great-like idea, but the hungarian and the english language very differentthey, therefore this funny excercise too many time consumewould up
On the other hand not knowI, whatabout should speakI
CanI speakto kittymy lifeabout, but not thinkI, that many person interestwould
Today, a very important national holiday is Hungary in
This (is) the anniversary the 1956 Revolution of
This a revolution the soviets against was 1956
October 23 on
This the day on, no one doesn't work and the schools too closed are
know(I) that little late(ly) join(I) the party-to but not even that bad idea that said(you)
Érdekes, hogy Október van, de mégis napos és egészen meleg az idő, körülbelül 15 fok van most kint
Szerintem mindig Októberben a legszebb az ég, legalábbis ha nincsenek felhők, ilyenkor sokkal kékebb, mint máskor
Az is elég furcsa, hogy mindjárt November, mégis tele vannak a fák levelekkel, sokuk még sárgulni sem kezdett
Interesting, that October is, but still sunny and pretty warm the weather, around 15 degrees is now out
In-my-opinion always October-in the most beautiful the sky, at-least if no clouds, at times like this much bluer, than other times
It too is pretty strange, that almost November, still full are the trees leaves-with, many-of-them yet to-get-yellower not started
No even know(I) how should this(for) at it begin
Maybe somehow like this
Ezt jól tetted, de szerintem elég furcsa, hogy a sofőr nem szólt rá erre a maszk nélküli illetőre
jobban kéne vigyáznunk egymásra
&#x200B;
That good did-you, but in-my-opinion pretty strange, that the driver not tell to this the mask without-er person-to
better should protect each-other
Gondoltam, hogy elég vicces, hogy a magyarban a jövőt kifejező segédige az azt jelenti, hogy fogni
:) Mellesleg máshogy is működik mint az angol, amit nehéz sajnos kifejezni az angol nyelv miatt
I thought, that rather funny, that the in Hungarian the future expressing auxilary-verb that that means that to hold
:) Besides elsehow too works like the English, what hard unfortunately express the English language due to
Then in-this similar the countries-ours each-other-to, sadly
The prime minister said:"George Soros will open the borders for immigrants" and after that started to make billboards saying:"George Soros will give citizenship to immigrants
Stop the Soros plan
Orbán Viktor once said: "A kormánynak soha nem az a dolga, hogy kormányozzon"
It means something like: "it's never a job of the government to govern"
Our government went ahead and did it
silly westerners and their imaginary friends lmao
From Lisboa
Yeah, kind of ironic that whose work is essential to maintain society and civilization can't work from home - who can shelter themselves by working from home could do nothing for a week or two and nobody would notice
[Budapest - Belgrade] is being upgraded right now for billions of Euros, the travelling time will decrease from 8 hours to 3 hours
The plan is to connect Thessaloniki with Budapest within 6-7 hours
From Thessaloniki there is high speed railway down to Athens
Unfortunately, it is not an "EU project" but a Chinese one, but it still could be the backbone for your idea
6 hours could be realistic between Budapest and Sofia within 10 years via Nis
However, Budapest-Varna will probably take longer for a very long time
Sidenote: Majority of these lines ([on your map] unfortunately would be heavily underused and financially not sustainable
For example the Cluj Napoca, Sofia one
I am not comfortable with the idea of single big investments paired with corrupt regions
The M4 metro in Budapest was one of a lesson of that kind
I would not want a Panama construction to happen
However I am open ears for arguments
I think extending the line to Vienna would be unnecessary
If you want to go more west from Budapest you could just use the Railjet
Bold of you to assume comments from my country exist here
...i think you need to regroup Hungary to the Balkans
Sure we don't qualify geographically, but politically we fit right in
And as things go our old buddies in Poland are also preparinb to join that club
Defenestration
The act of throwing someone or something out of a window
Discombobulation is one too
In Hungary we even have a menthol candy called 'Negro' lol
There is a candy brand Negro
The candy itself is black, but the brand was named after its inventor Pietro Negro
we did for some time but it stopped a few years ago
it's a shame tho, it was really an experience to look through it
A few weeks ago I saw some santa Claus decoration in the local supermarket
Here, the presents brought by the baby Jesus, we do not have santa Claus
It was 13 of October
I haven't come across anti-German sentiment in Hungary
I mean we have some opinions, about Germany itself, but I've never met anyone holding a negative opinion towards Germans
Anti-French sentiment, however
Almost everyone I know has a negative opinions on French people for some reason
Absolutely not a thing in Hungary as much as I know
We see Germans more to be followed throughout history, unfortunately more during crazy times of history i.e. WW2
I never understood this Austrian sentiment that they're "not Germans". Your entire history revolves around being Germans goddammit
Being from Hungary, I would say your standing among us is pretty good, even though everyone knows that you are tasteless humorless cunts
That is not anti German though, we hate everyone in a different way
I have a quite strong anti german government sentiment
People like Germany here
Everything happens here based on German standards watered down, like institutions, university courses, they make ton more than us
Well, there is political disagreement regarding migrants, which Merkel pushed a lot in 2016, but I wouldn't say people hate Germans as a result, more like politically
Also, in 1989 after borders opened, there is some conspiracy theory, or truth, I don't know that there were signs in Germany saying "magyar ne lopj"(Hungarians, don't steal), to prevent looting from immigrants, but hey, at least my family got a new fridge and a TV:) ...
So yeah, some old crazy conspiracy theorists might still be angry with that
Otherwise, I don't think anyone hates Germany for WW, not even the elderly, they hate Russia more probably
And France for Trianon (besides neighbouring countries) if we want to go further
I personally don't know any Jewish people, or survivors, but we fought with Germany, so I guess it makes sense that the majority doesn't remember, and then everyone suffered under communists before 1956
>Almost everyone I know has a negative opinions on French people for some reason
One can only guess what might be one of the most common reasons
Sure, but why would that still be a valid reason today
Can't we just grow up
Not at all
The government is "anti-brussels" but loves Germany because of many (mostly automotive) german companies that have settled down here
We provide cheap, okay workforce for low amount of money (speaking in german standards)
The goverment is happy because they are creating many workplaces + the germans are happy because of the salaries they have to pay for the workers
Win-win situation
The govt
talks about Brussels instead of the EU because shitting on the EU still doesn't sit well with the majority
I. Not Hungary, but the government
It's them only who identify themselves with Hungary which is a rhetorical twist and your example shows that unfortunately it works, but it's still wrong
They don't represent the country, but their 3M voters only
They are not Hungary in the slightest, not even a majority
Why would be the EU equal to Germany or the other way around
The single idea is arrogant to me
Nevertheless, it is Germany and France who are the strongest columns of the construction of the EU, but there are 26 more countries, hence I see your equation arrogant
>Personally, I’d disagree
We tend to differentiate between being German and being germanic/German-speakers
Ever since ww2, yes
The fake narrative of "Germany's first victim" couldn't have worked without such take
>Pretty sure we actually fought a couple of wars with Germany/German states, so that we wouldn’t be Germany
For example
If my memory serves me right, the Austro-Prussian War (for example) wasn't quite about that
Pretty much the opposite, actually
The war was over the leadership of the German states, a position, which was held by Austria since centuries
>Back in the day of the empire, anywhere refered to as Deutsch-Österreich (German Austria) was just anywhere that was Austrian and spoke German
Almost every single "German-speaking Austrian" back then would had identified as simply being German
A German from Austria, that is
lmao
it's accurate
Sure, no worries at all
It is true though that governments including Germany represent their countries and voters, hence are naturally biased
The only long term solution is a federal Europe where national governments can't do politics that only serve them to keep them in power, but the only existing single government represents the whole of Europe as a single unified unit
To a lesser degree, I don't think bmw is fashionable here, but you can make triple the money in Germany as a hotel worker
Just thought it was funny:)
The Hell energy drink is actually Hungarian, I had no idea
I figured it's American or something, so I was quite surprised, when I learnt about it
Plot Twist, Red Bull is originally more Thai than Austrian:
> Austrian entrepreneur [Dietrich Mateschitz] was inspired by an existing energy drink named [Krating Daeng] which was first introduced and sold in [Thailand] by [Chaleo Yoovidhya] He took this idea, modified the ingredients to suit the tastes of Westerners,[\[11\]] and, in partnership with Chaleo, founded Red Bull GmbH in 1987 in Chakkapong, Thailand
In [Thai] *daeng* means red, and a [*krating*] (known in English as a gaur or Indian bison) is a large species of wild [bovine] native to South Asia
Yoovidhya's heirs own majority stakes in both brands, and they both use the same red bull on yellow sun logo while continuing to market the separate drinks to the respective Thai and Western markets
I actually thought puma is italian, because when i was younger the Italian national team had Puma kits, and they still do i think
Where’s it from
Only exists in Hungary
What
The actual Wiener Schnitzel is made from calf
Swindon is obsessed with Japan, it seems
God bless
And Wiener Schnitzel is a big thing in Hungary
Bigger than in Austria, I daresay
I know this is going to be too far below and you are probably not going to read this but let me propose a thought experiment
You are in the US, where the law enforcement costs billions of tax payer dollars
In some places it is ineffective, and sometimes there are allegations that they are racist/triggerhappy/corrupt etc
Now imagine that John from an imaginary economic and military superpower comes to you and you find out that they have private law enforcement
There are many insurances that cover different kinds of costs: most people can call a patrol car if there is a violent crime in progress but not an investigator if something is stolen from their home
There are people in this imaginary country who just dont call the cops when they are being robbed at gunpoint because it is cheaper not to
There are people who just close their eyes and hope for the best if they hear a noise at night
John argues that his way is better because the US law enforcement is racist and just costs billions of taxpayer dollars
His law enforcement is such much more effective anyway
How does that sound
Pretty crazy
Look, it is not like its all a perfect world over here
There are severe problems with healthcare in the less developed regions of Europe, much like how state law enforcement is not perfect either
But I would say about 90%+ of Europeans are just completely, completely baffled that we even need to discuss this
And it is not because 90%+ of us are socialists/communists, I can assure you ;)
As a heritage from socialism, we have one single state-owned health fund in monopoly and 7% is deducted out of every pay-check to fund it
The up side is that you get unlimited consultations, diagnostics and treatment for free
The down side is that due to massive tax-evasion, the system is extremely underfunded which results in hospital building literally in ruins, month long waiting lists, inadequate supplies and disgruntled medical staff
Those who can afford it end up attending private medical facilities with very high prices compared to local salaries to escape the often inhumane conditions while contribution to the health fund is still deducted from their salaires
These problems are all common in the post-Communist countries around here - but that is not unexpected
These countries, my own very much included, tend to suffer from institutionalised corruption after decades of Communist rule and the sudden Wild West of privatisation in the 90s; wages are low and EU membership means that in-demand professionals, such as nurses and doctors, can easily find work in faaaaar richer countries that are just a stone's throw away
These countries tend to have a rapidly ageing population as young people emigrate in masses: this puts a lot more strain on all social services, especially healthcare
But none of these problems apply to the United States
It's a rich superpower with huge amounts of resources, high wages, a reasonably healthy age distribution and no issues with brain drain
They should not be compared to Hungary or the Czech Republic - their standard should be Norway and Sweden
In Hungary, you must be insured under the national health insurance system
It is mandatory for everyone
Most people are insured through employment: 7% of your paycheck goes to the national health insurance system
If you are unemployed and receiving unemployment assistance, the state covers your health insurance
You can only receive unemployment assistance for up to three months at a time though and only if you were employed for at least 360 days in the previous three years
Certain groups are automatically covered:
\- anyone under the age of 18
\- students
\- pensioners
\- homeless people
\- parents who are receiving childcare assistance (in practice, these are mostly mothers staying at home with their newborns)
And a few more groups that I won't list :) Now, if you are not employed, not receiving unemployment assistance and don't belong to any of these groups, you MUST pay a monthly fee to be covered
This is not optional
The fee is, in 2020, is 7710 HUF per month - that is roughly €23
The cost of pharmaceuticals is quite high: there is no "prescription cap" like what exists in the UK
The state subsidises a lot of different types of drugs but for people with, say, chronic diseases, the cost can still add up to insane amounts
Private insurance exists and some employers offer it as a benefit
Private hospitals tend to be more modern and better equipped, but obviously, you have to pay
I think it's pretty clear that the US is a great place to live if you are educated, young, healthy and childless
Just, you know, never get sick
There are faaaaaaar bigger differences between European countries than in between US states
Let's look at GDP per capita (not a perfect measurement by any means but the most easily comparable we've got
I also discounted the two huge outliers: District of Columbia and Luxembourg):
- The "richest" US state is New York, the "poorest" is Mississippi
85700 vs 38000 dollars per capita
That's a 2
25 multiplier
Steep, no doubt
- The richest EU country - again, apart from Luxembourg - is Ireland, with $84800
The poorest EU country is Bulgaria with $9800
That's an 8
65 multiplier
But even the next two, Romania and Croatia with $12450 and $15500, respectively, are waaaaay behind Ireland
In fact, even the difference between these countries and Mississippi is bigger than the difference between Mississippi and New York
Basically, you did what most Americans tend to do (though your flair suggests you're not an American), you overestimate the diversity of the United States and underestimate that of Europe
(The EU numbers are IMF estimates, the US numbers are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis)
Perfectly safe, and great quality tap water here
I don't understand anyone who would buy bottled water, it sometimes tastes worse than tap, not to mention all the waste that bottles cause
Weirdly enough, there are a lot of people here who don't trust tap water because it "might contain harmful minerals". Even if that were the case, it would only indicate that your house needs better piping
Haven't drunk bottled water in years
Tap water is just as good
I drink tap water often, but I cannot tell how frequent that is
There is a map that shows the level of lead pollution in tap water (click on the region to see the details):
Not Brita but I did buy a Laica one for Christmas
Tap water is really hard here, doesnt taste good but the Laica filter makes it as good as bottled water
This is also the case here in Hungary to an extent
Non-sparkling water is like food without salt for me
Pretty much non-stop
I'm at a point where more often than not, what I say in Hungarian barely makes sense because I use English idioms and sentence structures
Very often, and vice versa too
Depends what my thoughts are in at that moment, if I'm thinking in Hungarian then I won't remember stuff in English and if I'm thinking in English I forget how to speak my own language haha
>But what worries me, as I read less and less in Polish, but continue to consume different media in English, I almost feel like my English vocabulary gets more and more sophisticated while Polish diminishes (case in point)
I had similar worries
Then i tried to talk about some of these "exotic" topic to my friends, and realized, that it does matter diddle all, that i don't know it in hungarian
&#x200B;
>Also for many topics I would straight-out feel uncomfortable talking in Polish because I feel like the vocabulary needed is crude or awkward, while in English this connotation is much weaker
...well hungarians had a similar problem with lacking words and expressions in the early 1800s - as latin was the language of the educated classes, the language of bureocracy, the language of science
Then came the language reform, so we have a drastically enlarged dictionary
Even some basic stuff like out stuff for beak "csőr" comes from that time, it was created by cső + orr (meaning pipe & nose)
I feel it was EXTREMELY succesfull, as the expression for physics, math ...etc
are far more intuitive than the english ones
For example "angular momentum" is perdület - and you get the jist of it without need for definition
And naturally some thing did go too far
People tried to make a new name for every damned element on the periodic table - NOBODY wants to learn that TWICE
Thankfully that didn't stuck
...do ethnic minorities lack linguistic autonomy in Latvia
(I mean here, you have anything from street signs to what ammounts to a parallel government - and currently we have VERY little minority population)
Well Austria is the balkans of the german world
Does is also hold true in matter other than linguistics
>We have some political pro-Russian parties, but one of them is just meh, would never vote for them, and another one always turned out to be in opposition despite gathering the biggest amount of voice
I feel that as a citizen I don't have voting rights if I don't vote for 'correct' political power
That is not a "minority" problem, that is a general problem with REPRESENTATIVE democracies, on all issues
See Biden vs
Trump
Here in Hungary as a member of a majority, i don't feel i have an option to pick where i would feel represented
&#x200B;
>I could drag on and on, but basically this is the result of post-Soviet Latvian goverment denying local Russian community citizenship which was promised in turn for supporting separation from USSR
We still have non-citizens here who refuse to take naturalization exam or learn the language properly
That goes against all kinds of international treaties most EU countries signed, and i assume Latvia did too
Well people are poeple everywhere
It took my grandparents to know about Trump, to acknowledge that the US is not "perfect promise land" just a big country
Too much hollywood movies does that to people in eastern europe
Talking about politics
Ends in a fight in most cases
Don't talk about the immigrants and Hungary's refusal of letting them in
Both of the factions (supporters and opposers) are so radical that you would probably start a whole civil war
Always accept pálinka if offered . It’s a sign of hospitality and it’s incredibly rude to decline
If someone invites you to their house you better accept the home made pálinka they offer you
whats the difference
(In hungarian the netherlands is called hollandia - ofc
Its thepolitically incorrect language with noone really getting whats wrong with néger)
>Seriously, we are not Germans
Ofcourse not
You're Bavarians after all
I know right
Upper Hungary is only correct for the mountainous parts, otherwise you're just simply North Hungary
Yeah, I mean I don't get this huge nationalism in Hungary
Everybody is blathering about our "lost territories", overlooking the fact that the majority of the people living there have never been Hungarian
Therefore, Hungarians living there should adapt or go to live somewhere else, not the other way around
There is a running joke in hungary marking things "Younger than Slovakia
" Even I found it a bit offensive
I would be interested in the opinion of someone from Slovakia about this
Btw the hungarian name of that part of the old country is "Felvidék", literally "Upper country"
Please
:-D
Yes please
People need to chill the fuck out, and accept that you cannot draw lines on the map thst separate ethnicities cleanly
Here close to the croatian border we have plenty of ethnic croatian villages, or ones with roots in croatian ethnicity
Same with hungarians on the other side of the border - and noone is freaking out over it

The region called felvidek is not Slovakia, its in slovakia, but its certainly very far from being the whole of it
Even the rare batshit inaane irredentist "revert trianon" people dont contemplate annexing Slovakia
And for the sane majority its just the name of a region that used to be part of the contry
The distinction is made due to relatively small regions having unique customs within hunagry
(Before the age of modern transportation and telecommunication, and before modern concepts of nationalism, a LOT of regional customs developed - similarly to what you have in Austri, and people likethem)
Except Csallóköz and Székelyföld

Bold of you to write this
Germany entered the chat
TIL there's a country with even less press freedom than Hungary in the EU
Presumably Hungary
Probably not in face-to-face conversation, but mention the Treaty of Trianon anywhere online and Hungarians and our neighbours start fighting
No, not at all
I mean it's not like you go on random youtube video that even vaguely mentions Romania, Hungary, but especially Transylvania in any way and you find some Hungarian and Romanian nationalists starting shit and citing the same arguments endlessly
I have a Romanian friend, and after a tense arguement, we agreed that it's best if we just simply don't argue about history with each other lol
Also, on YouTube, I have yet to see a video about Hungary where Romanians/Slovaks don't taunt Hungarians with Trianon
No matter what the video is about, there will always be Slovaks and Romanian chanting "Viva Trianon" and other bs
Igen tudjuk, de a Kárpát medencében élő népek nem a városra gondolnak, hanem a békeszerződésre
I have not heard Italy or Spain to be associated with being ‘poor’. There are way ‘poorer’ countries in the EU than Italy or Spain, such the whole of the Eastern bloc basically
I think it´s a very good idea
There are sounds in Hungarian that are immensely difficult for foreigners to pronounce so I give them a pass
It still sounds horrible
Also they just can't grasp the proper intonation
[Here] the pronunciation is good but the intonation is all over the place
Like the guy in the hospital in the Usual Suspects
Horrible pronunciation
They could’ve used a native speaker
Yep
10 bonus points for the flawless "gy" sound but someone really should have taught him to always always always stress the first syllable
It's such an ironclad, easy to remember rule and immediately makes your Hungarian pronunciation a thousand times better
Hikers, cross country/downhill bikers, motorcyclists, and fishermen are about the only people who greet eachother while being perfect strangers
Until it's not Griass Di, you are not high enough :D
On my part, it's a citation from a sign I've seen in a Hütte - 'Griass Di - wei' üwa 1500m gibt's koa Sie'. Normally you'd greet others as Grüss Gott, but in the mountains you'll loose any formality, you'll be both informal and local, so it's just that

This isn't really a crazy thing, but a weird one that shows that just how salty we are and mad about at all the invading countries in our history, but we still survived and have are own little things like this;
> It is considered rude to clink your beer glasses
Legend has it that when the 1848 Hungarian revolution against the Habsburgs was defeated, 13 Hungarian generals were executed, with the Austrians clinking their beer glasses after each execution
As a result, Hungarians vowed not to cheers with beer for 150 years - and while the time has passed, the custom remains
Eye contact is a must when Egeszsegedre-ing anything else, though
Corruption
Yeah, we had that too
This was totally common in Hungary, and I think, some people still do this
I can relate to this somehow
Look, you can still feel the vibe of the film, since you hear the original sound

They were never part of "Austria", only the Habsburg Empire; but they actually were part of the late Kingdom of Hungary, and it's really shame that they don't use the name _fröccs_ or some kind of variation of that (like "freč")

The word Hallo/Hello comes from the Hungarian langauge
When the first telephon exchanges were built by Tivadar Puskás, the workers used to start the conversation by saying "Hallom
" / "I hear you
" This is maybe the only commonly used Hungarian-based word
We've got the same thing, but with the English
"Angolosan távozni" - To leave like an Englishman
>ranlette espagnole
First I read "brainlet espagnole". That was an amusing half moment
According to wiktionary it comes from the middle English word "halou".
We say that too
Italians and Hungarians also say Englishman
There's nothing saying stuff like "this power lasts until *insert date here*" but it is said that he has this power until the pandemic is over
This means they can (and probably they will) lie about its presence, and make this period longer
His power isn't "unlimited". Honestly, the law they passed is unnerving (especially the part which affects the freedom of speech) but I think people overreact a little bit and many people seem to have limited (or no) understanding of what happened
He already had 2/3 of the votes in the parliament, there is nothing he can do now which he couldn't do before
He just had to jump through one or two mostly symbolic hoops
Anyway, the implications for the EU: As a European leader, I'd be excited to be honest
If FIDESZ doesn't deliver, people will vote them out
They gave Orban such extensive powers that there will be no one else to blame in domestic politics if he fails
They can easily lose the election if the economy collapses but even just losing the 2/3 in the parliament would be huge for the country
If FIDESZ delivers, there is one less country which has to be saved and they have no reason to keep up the emergency as they'll easily win the next election too
Much agreed
I can only suspect that towards the worse: once it's over many will find themselves without a job/income
That will rock the boat for practically everything and will most probably create turbulence at every level and from so many aspects we can't even foresee
Unleashed populism from the US, through Brazil, UK, Hungary, Poland an so on, don't all signal any good
These are more or less demanded by the societies around and these societies will not just sober up the following Monday, saying " ah let's just do something sensible". It will turn much worse before it gets any better
I hope I'm wrong
Orbán doesn't actually want out of the EU, not while we get lots of money from them anyway
Most of his rhetoric isn't actually directed at the EU (the EU is more popular among Hungarians than almost anywhere else), but at Brussels, which in Hungarian govt
communications is this vaguely defined, George Soros controlled bureaucratic great evil
He doesn't really care about ideology, only about stealing money for his family and friends
The whole state is set up to enrich them
As long as the EU is sending money, he can keep stealing
If funding was cut however, things could get interesting
He could, but that would hurt his own interests too
He has enough soft power to control the country without formalizing it like this for long, in 6 to 8 months he will give up these powers and he will not just be stronger but he will also be abel to prove how "democratic" he is
Cutting EU funds would be the most common solution, but for hungary's case there's an easier solution
Even a simple threat from the German multies can force Orbán to give up powers
Yeah, not having to get consent from parliament doesn't really matter when you have complete control over it anyway
The main concern is that anti-government journalists could get jailed for spreading "fake news", when in reality it is the government controlled media that is losing dozens of rectification lawsuits
The main reason why Fidesz was able to consolidate so much power is because the previous government royally fucked up the response to the 2008 financial crisis
Let us hope that this crisis will fuck them in turn
At this point, Jobbik aren't the far right party anymore, it's Fidesz
Most of Jobbik's far right members left to form Mi hazánk, which is just parroting Fidesz
Besides, we have center left parties as well, who cooperated with each other and Jobbik to make massive gains in the mayoral elections last autumn
To be fair there's also the Italians, and that one country that literally left the EU
But yeah, there are a lot of nationalists here, and they tend to hate the EU
> I’m honestly curious about why they seem to think this
It's a bit generous to say they think, they just parrot Russian propaganda
> I think something being glossed over here is suspension of all elections and referendums while the order is in effect, except the order has no expiration
That isn't accurate
Not "all" elections are suspended in the current form of the law
Our next general election is in 2022 and it isn't affected
Anyway, I think people still don't understand Orbán and what makes him dangerous if they are worried about him getting rid of elections
I'm not sure, honestly
EU funding is one of the main driving forces of the Hungarian economy, so it would definitely affect regular citizens, but it might help get rid of Orbán. Or he might use it to further entrench his power, who knows
Either way it's probably not gonna happen since Poland has got his back
Orbán and the boys are mostly being funded by the EU
I don't believe they would survive if the funding got cut
Any construction projects happen to go to companies owned by Orbán's friends and family, they all happen to be really expensive, and they all happen to run into extra costs along the way
Quite the coincidence
It's really not that hard to misuse EU funds
Edit: Here is an example from a New York Times article:
That's what I'm hoping for
The carcass of our opposition actually showed signs of life in the local elections when the economy was doing well so there is a tiny hope
The article isn't really accurate in a few places
It's hard to tell if they didn't have good sources or it's just sensationalism but, unfortunately, this is very common when it comes to Hungary (or I assume any other small country with a difficult to learn language)
Anyway, by elections and referendums are affected by the law, general elections aren't. That's a big difference
The first sentence is similarly inaccurate
The timeframe isn't indefinite, it's bound to the end of the pandemic
This obviously isn't ideal but it's an important difference
There will be a point when they can't claim anymore that there is a pandemic going on
My biggest issue with these inaccuracies is that they HELP Orbán. Every time he does something controversial and the media reports on it like this, he can just point out the mistakes/biased parts and claim that "the media owned by foreign billionaires is running a negative campaign against him".
It usually boils down to 1/3 of people supporting whatever Orbán does, 1/3 opposing it, and 1/3 being mostly apathetic to politics in general
I know for sure that those of us who generally oppose the government oppose this as well
All the opposition parties in the parliament voted against it too
As for those who don't care about politics or those who like Orbán I don't know, but I imagine this might raise a few eyebrows amongst them as well
In the movie _Chicago_, in the Cell Block Tango where the supposedly Hungarian "Katalin" is telling her story
In "Hungarian".
The thing is, the actress was Russian, and she clearly didn't speak Hungarian at all
So, it is barely comprehensible even for a native Hungarian, only some words; but there were complete lines I had to look up
It's not gibberish, it is a somewhat meaningful story, it's just so badly pronounced that it doesn't sound like anything
90% of the time when a character in a moovie speaks hungarian I don't even realise, only on like the 3
time I watch it
Even then it's a mistery what the whole sentence was
They always try to speak with a slavic accent
Like, why did they choose hungarian if they are not going to put the tiniest effort into it
Yeah, right, becouse there aren't a lot of people speaking hungarian
Regardless, it is pretty common compared to our country's popularity that a random character speaks hungarian in a moovie, but it's almost never done correctly and almost always spoke with a slavic accent
Theres a scene in the series Zoo where a guy who mutated into a beast was hungarian and took a last video of himself saying goodbye to her loved one but if you hear it once, you can barely understand it
I watched the series on Netflix in German so I don't know how it is in other languages
A comedian once said the opposite: "I was so drunk one time that I was able to understand the language of the animals for an hour and a half
Ah yeah, the scouse accent
Big Liverpool FC fan and luckily got the chance to see the team play against Napoli in the UCL
I spent 2,5 days in Liverpool
By the 3rd day I started getting the hang of the accent, but the first day was just straightup terrible

Az igen
Volt néhány mondat amit sikerült elkapni, de aztakurva, voltak olyanok is amiket többszöri meghalgatás után sem lehet érteni
Yes, they have some accent, but it's genuine and well comprehensible
Btw, the video's really funny, since it's about that the original voice track and the subs are more or less correct; but the Hungarian dubbing uses some kind of amusing caricature redneck accent to indicate the difference between the "English" and the "Hungarian" parts
:D More precisely: the Americans speak standard Hungarian, and the Hungarians speak redneck Hungarian
And the lines themselves are also not the same
I'm sorry

Net per capita monthly income above 6000 NOK is considered rich

Good move
Humans live in communities
If we have the means to fight contagious deseases and it takes everyone to participate than we must all be a part of it
Yes, I support mandatory vaccination
Unless you live in a remote farm, you inevitably encounter a lot of people every day - co-workers, people on public transport, people in stores, and so on - and you have no right to wilfully endanger those people, and they have no right to wilfully endanger you either
I disagree with any religious or similar exemptions, too, for the same reason: it has an impact on others unless you live as an extreme shut-in which is just not realistic
I hope more countries will follow Germany in this question
I’d gladly have anti-vaccination criminalised and the act of spreading anti-vaccination propaganda constituted as endangering and misleading the public
I’m not sure if I’d say it’s terrorism, but maybe in certain cases it could be
Same, you have to take them every year
That's why many people don't work in most of December
But some workplaces alow you to not take it but rather revive a big premium at the end of the year
During the renovation of a historical place boards with information were placed there with text in both Hungarian and English, but the English "translation" on all of these boards was [Same in English]
Restaurant mistranslations are really common, a well known one is "fuckup with marmalade" which is a pastry filled with jam (lekváros bukta), but "bukta" also means failure in other contexts
Just a few days ago I saw one (it was posted to r/engrish I think
) saying "virgin coins" which is a mistranslation of pork tenderloin medallions
Not English and technically not a translation either but [this sign] is one of my faves - they wanted to translate it to Serbian but probably forgot to switch the source language to Hungarian in google translate so instead of weird inaccurate machine translated Serbian text they ended up with a Cyrillic transliteration of the Hungarian text
This is the 1st time I see it
Good luck with democracy, I hope the transition will be successful unlike for many formerly authoritarian states
Do you think something will actually change
Or will the next president just maintain the status quo
We know that change is a lie
Good luck then, I hope you grab the opportunity
Budapest here, I wasn't even aware that some people put our city and Prague in the same category as Ibiza and Amsterdam
Anyway, I don't care
Most of the partying is restricted to a few neighborhoods and it doesn't annoy the rest of the city
My job doesn't depend on tourism and I don't party in these places
Change our image or not, I'm fine
That said, there is a type of tourism I want to get rid of ASAP: English bachelor parties
They are fucking obnoxious, regularly harass women and they occasionally try to fight each other/anyone they find
Bonus answer: I'm one of the few Europeans who genuinely enjoyed Las Vegas
However, I don't think the concept would work here
I agree, I think the landmarks attract many more tourists than the party district
When I read the post's title I immediately thought of those bachelor party groups lol
I mean you have great beer in any place you sit in, which is often cheap too
And nowadays we have quite a few tourists compared to the pre-covid times
yeah I don't think many locals go to the party district
When I was there, that's what I did all day, I kinda thought of that as partying
then again I'm central European poor guy, so I tried to avoid expensive places
It was around 30°C today, and will continue to rise in the weekend
Fortunately, it's dropping a lot at night, so I usually just leave my window open to let the temperature to cool down in the house and then close it in the morning to keep the "cold" inside
Here in Hungary in the morning it was raining so everyone put on their coats and then it turned boiling hot
I dont know, its average where i live, actually there was a lot of heavy thunderstorm like 1-2 weeks ago
Yeaaaaah we are fine
\*dies of heatstroke\*
But seriously the nights are the worst
The days are fine since you can go somewhere
The worst thing is that there were like code red/orange storms right above  our city but my grandma's city was fine 20 kilometres away
And now there is like 36 celsius heat
Cmon weather fix urself
After suffering through many hot summers, I just ordered AC to be installed in my house yesterday
It's half past twelve and already more than 30°C, and humidity is pretty high, too (45 %)
There have been severe thunderstorms (with flash floods and funnel clouds) in the country these days, but none in Budapest
And it isn't forecast for today and tomorrow
And this summer hasn't been particularly hot so far
My sister jokingly said that we don't have seasons that lasts for months anymore, but seasons that lasts for days; one day it's raining, next day there's snow, third day it's really cold, then it's like summer again
30°C isn't really considered that hot here to be honest, it's an average summer temperature
It's more of the humidity that's extra bothersome right now
It's currently at 77%
Yeah, I'm allright, got a bit wet from the Rain and when it stopped I got sweaty
But it's only gonna get worse
Well I just stayed inside in bad weather and go outside in good weather
I usually go outside with the dog
The poor thing isn't being walked really (since none of us are home)  so he is so excited that he grabs the leash and walks himself
I sleep with only the covers of my blanket (the outside part) so I don't boil myself
You see our house's interior is lined with wood so it keeps in heat
So we just open windows like 10 degrees (like yknow degrees in math
You can open windows like that by flipping the knob up and pull)
There will be rain the next week which means mosquitoes
And heat
Good thing I have a fan
Which part is scary to you
Temperature usually gets up to 35+°C for weeks in summer, hopefully with low humidity
You can get used to it
And I think Hungary is generally more equipped with AC than Western Europe because of the climate
Severe storms happen in Hungary, but they usually cause property damage (lighting strikes, fallen trees etc); life-threatening danger is quite rare; although there was a woman who drowned in a flash flood few weeks ago, but that's extremely rare
One or two unfortunate people get struck by lightning every year
So we rather welcome storms, as they bring some refreshment in the heat
England, The Low Countries, Germany and Italy are in the "Blue Banana", the most populated and well developed area of Europe

Hahaha I find it adorable :D
Ózd
(even the name has an unwelcoming tone)
It's a mining/steel milling city that has been uplifted by the old communist regime, under the delusional Stalinist goal that we'll become the "country of iron and steel", even though our whole history was centered on agriculture
As you can guess, after the iron curtain fell, the whole state-owned steel production industry went down the drain
Being one of the poorest towns, the city consists mostly of grey, ten story concrete panel houses, a few scattered churches, and a big-ass gypsy colony
You can judge by those facts how cheerful living there must be
Ózd in North-East Hungary
Used to be a major metallurgy centre
Absolute unite of dreadfulness and depression
On the flip side it is located in a wonderful environment, surrounded by beautiful hills
I kinda like brutalist architecture, but not really the post industrial decay, so I would like to nominate my hometown, Ózd:
The most depressing fact about the town that after 1989 and the de-industrialization they had to choose another spot as "town center", because the earlier one was the metallurgical plant itself
All of our towns have at least some of these fucking ugly satellite state era buildings but I was about to nominate Ózd too
It just looks sad and dystopic
Worst part
The location/scenery is absolutely great and it could be a gem if not for this weird forced industrialization
It's interesting because in Borsod, a city is either beautiful, or ugly af, there is no inbetween
> Article A)
> The name of OUR COUNTRY shall be Hungary
Article 1
The State of Hungary is a republic
Just the 1st one in itself doesn say much
So for fun fact heres the 2nd:
Article 2
(1) The Republic of Hungary is an independent, democratic constitutional state
(2) In the Republic of Hungary supreme power is vested in the people, who exercise their sovereign rights
directly and through elected representatives
(3) No activity of any person may be directed at the forcible acquisition or exercise of public power, nor at
the exclusive possession of such power
Everyone has the right and obligation to resist such activities in such
ways as permitted by law

Taken in spring during the first wave, our dear PM decided to visit some hospitals, this picture shows a lot of things:
-the PM has the better quality mask
-the doctor can't even wear it properly
-the walls are collapsing
-the lift doesn't work
-and the fire extinguisher is just laying on the floor randomly lol
Idk how that happened but I fixed it lol

Mother in law bad, Trianon bad, Romanian bad, pálinka good
Well here in northern Pest county it's relatively alright actually, but yeah the border regions to the east of here are some of the poorest in the country
Hungary and Slovakia should work together more
A common project in the region would be more effective, than the indepentent, neglecting approach
I loved Galicia
The moderate weather there was a long-awaited blessing after the insufferable desert that is called Castille-León.

Yeah true, especially for Somogy county
It has a lot of hills
Ah yes, historical determinism
My favourite
Hát amit azért hoztam létre, hogy ne kerüljek trébe
It's not very major, but Matthias Corvinus conquered Vienna in 1485 and it became the new capital for a decade
Maybe the Pan-European Picnic
Now, I would consider this a big event for all of Europe as it was the first time the Iron Courtain was cut, and people were allowed to enter "The West" freely for the first time
The event was popularized among East Germans with posters written in German, and thus a lot of them decided to travel to Hungary
About 300 East Germans fled to the West during the picnic, while thousands were waiting for another possibility like this near the other parts of the country
The Hungarian government once again re-enforced border regulations and thousands of arrests were made until one incident, where an East German man has been shot by a border guard
This was a turning point, and a decision was made against the likes of the Soviet Union and East Germany, the borders were to be open again on September 10th
This was the first time a Warsaw Pact country permanently opened its borders with the West, East Germans escaped to the West en masse and indirectly led to the fall of the Berlin wall
So yeah, cool topic
Maybe the Siege of Belgrade in 1456
Or the siege in 1521, for that matter
Belgrade was the key fortress of the Hungarian defense system, which protected the country from the Ottomans
The siege of 1456 was a huge triumph, where Mehmet II, the same guy who conquered Constantinople was beaten back
The siege of 1521 was the complete opposite
The city fell, and the road to Mohács was paved
I don't think many know about how Hungary ended up as a Habsburg 'colony', or the tensions the two states/nations had from the getgo, or the independent Transylvania of the time
The Aster Revolution of 1918 is a very close second, because even Hungarians have a warped image of it with all the politically motivated misinformation about it, first by the Horthy government, then the communists, then now the shadow of the socialist era
There's very little trustworthy literature about it
I would say the 1848-49 war for freedom is not that well known
Most only know of the revolution i presume
By "long" time, do you mean 1993 or something like Svätopluk
I was 8 years old that year
It wasn't that **long** ago
We know about it
Hungary accepted lots of Greek refugees at that time
We even have a town called Beloiannisz (the Hungarian spelling of Nikos Beloyannis' name) which was once exclusively, nowadays partly inhabited by Greeks
We are grateful for bringing authentic Greek food (like real gyros, souvlaki and tzatziki) to our country
:) The best gyros in Budapest is made by a Greek couple whose parents (? or other relatives) fled from Greece back then
Once my friend told me that when he was having an oral exam in history, there was another guy who was asked to name the participating countries in WW1
He mentioned the big ones, then Portugal, after which the teacher literally counted it as a MISTAKE, because according to her Portugal was neutral
Yes, the examiner teacher from history didn't know that Portugal was actually in the war
Part of
Wasn't it more like a personal union
When did you hear me say Hungary was the only one
You must be 12
Or compared to the Kingdom of Hungary which existed for more than 900 years
It was so strange that when we were in France they put a pitcher of tap water on our table in every restaurant without even asking for it, and refilled it when it was empty
This is unheard of in Hungary, why would they provide something for free that would potentially cut into their profits
Of course they'll give you tap water for free if you ask for it, but I imagine that you'd get the same reaction as you got
Next level: drinking wine from those cheap promotional coca cola glasses that you get for free if you buy six at once
A well-known Hungarian song goes smth like: "it's scandalous that the criminal code does not consider vbk (equivalent of kalimotxo) a crime against humanity"
It's same in Hungary, but sometimes they just can't check if you're a customer
In some places give customers a code written on the receipt which you can open the door
d + z + s is one letter and it makes a J sound (English J)
I'm not sure if this is a unique feature, but Hungarian city names use different endings for "in" for places that are within and outside the territory of historical Hungary
For example, there is a town called Velence in Hungary, and the Hungarian name for Venice, Italy is also Velence
However, "in Velence, Hungary" is "Velencé**n**", while "in Venice, Italy" is "Velencé**ben**".
The letters ő and ű, I'm pretty sure they're unique to Hungarian
Good luck finding fonts that include them
We have letters which consist of two letters, and there is even a letter with three symbols
And unlike in other languages, they are a normal part of the alphabet and they all have their own unique sounds
Due to vowel harmony and because the "e" is the most common vowel in Hungarian, we can express almost everything using only "e" vowel
For example, here is our hymn in eszperente (the name of this thing):
>Nemzetemet ne vesd el,
>egek fejedelme;
>segedelmezd kezeddel
>seregekkel szemben
>Ezerszer lett megvetett,
>de szeretve lehet,
>elszenvedte e nemzet
>jelent meg egyebet
It might sound a bit weird, and has a bit different meaning, but it's possible :D
We use the following letters regularly: á, é, í, ó, ő, ö, ú, ű, ü, and of course "dzs", "gy", "sz" "zs" and "cs" which all count as one letter
Polish has dzi for dzs although they don't count it as one word
However except for maybe Taiwanese (they have weird letters), we are probably the only language who uses ő, ű characters
And then there's "Pécsett" lol
Like in literally every language besides English
We can build the same structure, but it would be separated by a space because our rule is that if it's not common usage then we write it separately, but the same exists
*Bilderrahmenzerhacken* \- festőkeret vágás.
...and search for [the singer named "fekete pákó" trying to pronounce "pöttyös labda" (spotted ball) and tücsök (cricket)] to see somebody suffer trying to make that sound
Yeah but that's not unique to Turkish
This is actually a different thing than what op described and happens in most agglutinative languages
How the F is hungarian based on latin
NONE of our simple words that describe stuff in primitive rural life have anything to do with latin
As such its pretty apparent that the word we used earliest in our history as a linguistic group, predate latin
Our latin rooted words are mostly related to things like school, church ...etc
which only became part of our culture after settling in hte carpathian basin
The real question is how we write it out phonetically  and the answer is "hagen daz".
And of course people will pronounce it wrong in all sorts of ways
Not only Slavic ones
Hungarian nouns can have up to 36 different forms
Really
good to know
Hungarian also has merre - which way
>Heck, even the 'most Hungarian' of things -their traditional bows have Sarvet - Czarvek
Siyah in english
Just to point out one of the most obvious similarities
You mean "szaru"?
Words describing stuff related to hunter gatherer life long predate bow useage, and they are off fino ugric origin, words like hal, or other stuff listed here:  [
Whats next are you going to tell me that "Hello" is also an evidence for English and Hungarian being related
>!The phrase originates from Bell's hungarian lab assisstant saying "hallom" ("i hear it" in hungarian), on recieving voice
The EU is planning to abolish daylight savings time
While the final decision is yet to come, would you prefer keeping summer time or winter time
Why
I prefer winter time, bucause summer time was made up so more energy is saved, if we abolish the change we should go back to the original time
Hungary is one of the few countries that might be better off using summer time, being quite close to the border between UTC+1 and UTC+2
Someone even made a detailed breakdown why GMT+2 would be the best for Hungary:  (in Hungarian)
Or if we want to go a bit ridiculous, we could use UTC+1:30
:-D
EDIT: An article from the aforementioned page, in English, comparing time zones for Central European cities:
I hear you, I really do, but it’s not just loss of one hour, but a week if not weeks of being miserable, sleepy and kept afloat by caffeine because my whole sleeping cycle is messed up twice a year
I always envied those who weren’t affected by the time change as I am
>biannually
That means every two years
The word you are looking for is "semiannually".
Also Ukraine, Moldova and the entire Balkans
Let's assume Barcelona, based on your flair
Geographically correct time zone (UTC+0):
* 21 June: sunrise at 4:18, sunset at 19:28
* 21 December: sunrise at 7:13, sunset at 16:24
Staying on winter time (UTC+1):
* 21 June: sunrise at 5:18, sunset at 20:28
* 21 December: sunrise at 8:13, sunset at 17:24
Staying on summer time (UTC+2):
* 21 June: sunrise at 6:18, sunset at 21:28
* 21 December: sunrise at 9:13, sunset at 18:24
Of course, this would mean wildly different times for someone living in A Coruña, where solar time is 40 minutes less compared to Barcelona, i.e. everything happens 40 minutes later
Haha, yes I am
If I stay up late, and I don’t get to sleep as much as I’m used to, for sure I have the same issue the next day, or days if I don’t manage to catch up on sleep
The time change is a bit different though, it’s like not getting enough sleep for a week at least, so it messes up my sleep cycle/patterns a bit
Maybe I should go to bed an hour earlier
but then again, this discussion is about the impact this has on individuals and whether it could be done away with
Then I was wrong, sorry
UTC+0 is probably the worst option here, even though that would be geographically fitting
For Barcelona, both winter and summer time seem good, but considering the whole of Spain, UTC+1 (winter time) seems to be the best (in my opinion)
(EDIT3: However, that would mean an 8:50 sunrise in A Coruña in late December
~~EDIT: Or maybe not
UTC+2 would mean a really late winter sunrise in the east, and a comfortable schedule for the west
UTC+1 would mean an early summer sunset for the west, and a comfortable schedule for the east
Spain could have two timezones, maybe
UTC+1:30
~~ It really depends on personal preferences
EDIT2: Sorry, I have no idea if what I'm writing makes sense
Time zones are a really confusing thing, and I'm a bit too tired to think clearly
This is a shared one, but the connection between Polish and Hungarian people is one of the strongest in the world
This is mostly because of the similiarities between our history and some other factors as well
We even have a Polish-Hungarian friendship day on the 23rd of March
And to all the Polish people reading this: love you guys
Hungarian bus drivers always greet/wave at/flash at each other when they meet on the road, regardless of which company and sector they work in
In addition bus drivers working companies that operate other vehicles (such as the Budapest Trasport Co
BKV which has trams etc) will greet their colleagues driving those
Tram drivers use their left turn signals when passing each other to say "hello" (which is definitely not conforming the highway code, but they do it anyway)
We also have Tiszavirágzás!
Maybe Moscow

Grand Theft Auto 6: Miskolc City Stories
I would imagine a mission like the episode in Black Mirror called shut up and dance i think
But i dont know if that was filmed in a shithole english town
The taxi drivers
Sometimes they give back the change in expored banknotes, and take the longer route
And the ruins bars
Old bulidings with overpriced, but cheap quality alcohol
Halászbástya - Fisherman's Bastion
The view is not bad, but it's not that different from any other place in the Castle District
The building isn't old, it was finished in 1902, it just mimics the Roman style
I think it's a kitsch
You have to pay to get in
Budapest itself
Don't get me wrong, it has some really fascinating landmark, but there's not much original building left to look at
Post-WW1, WW2 and the revolution in 56 had it's toll on the city
Aside the old bridge, the Buda Castle (i wouldn't recommend tho, Orbán claimed it for himself), the parliament and several other buildings are fascinating, but the rest of the city is just boring
One of my Estonian friend took us to a place something with the name Wilhelm in it I cant remember exactly and it was fantastic and no tourists knew about it apparently, we had such a great time in Tallinn
What do you mean by "original building"? What is old enough for you
I think it's really cool that several districts of the inner city in a broader sense (like almost until Dózsa György út - Fiumei út - Haller utca) consists of the old style condominium buildings and many parts still live as a city, not just a museum or a puppet theatre as for example Prague
Sure, the poorer parts of Józsefváros aren't the nicest, but gentrification isn't always a positive thing
I would have said the Puszta
There's literally nothing there
It's the plains in Eastern Hungary
Budapest compared to that is the most wonderful place on Earth
You are not allowed to answer
Edit: Thanks anon for the silver, I hope you are a poor Norwegian
Just went there on Sunday
It's the same all day right now ;)
The office of the ministerpresident was moved from the Parlament to a monastery in the Castle district
Personaly I don't see it as a problem, but many do and they have many reasons for that
The office of the M. president was moved to the Parlament during the communist era, nowadays the current governement trying to erase communist "traditions" and legacy, so they are bringing back pre-communist things
The residence also costed a lot of money, and there are big parties there for the governement friendly elite
They built an extra balcony what isn't part of the historical view of the castle and many didn't like that
It also costed a huge pile of money, but at least they spent it on something what could move forward the country
I don't mind that the office of the ministerpresident was moved, I think the legislative and the executive powers shouldn't be in the same house
It used to be popular in the eighties and nineties among German tourists
No idea how they did the marketing back then
I talked to Germans to ask what the appeal was, they said the romantic endless plains where you can ride away in the sunset and eat spicy, fatty food, drink local wine
It isn't communist itself, but the action of moving the office of the mpr
to the Parlament was done by the communists, so it had to go
I'm not that nacionalistic, and I don't hate the Romanians from the bottom of my heart
I don't want to revive Greater Hungary
But I do hate the treaty of Trianon
I'm not a nationalist and I'm not pessimistic either, but I have to admit that I love paprika and pálinka
Also, I definitely don't consider myself racist, I've traveled to lots of countries (started it at a very young age), so I think I'm used to foreigners and different cultures
And also, I have a few Romanian friends :)
I'm a pretty bad Hungarian
I'm not nationalistic, I don't constantly cry about Trianon and I don't want to "reclaim the lost lands". I actually hate pálinka, but I guess I do like paprika
I don't like gulyás, though
I'm not pessimistic either
EDIT: I'm also not homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic and racist, since that's become more and more common in Hungary over the last few years, sadly
Soo
•I’m vegan and grew up mostly vegetarian
• I’m a leftist, as far from our government rn as possible
• Good at foreign languages
•Care about my health
On the other hand I am pretty pessimistic and am kind of a loner
Also I’ve lived in switzerland for while now so that might’ve infuenced some of these
I don't live on the Puszta, haven't ridden a horse in years, don't sport a mustache, but can actually make a badass gulyás (and no, you're probably not doing it right
Nobody does
Okay but who doesn't enjoy going to IKEA
Pretty relaxing
I imagine you shouting from a castle battlement
*"Your mother was a hamster, and your father smells of elderberies"*
Do you also drive a rally car to work
>. I don't want to revive Greater Hungary
I think majority of us don't?
Same, but I'll add not being racist and homophobic to my list
Sadly the majority are these things, since most of Hungary consists of older people, who think that the only good way of life is a white Hungarian cishet marriage with preferably 4-6 kids
Yay other decent hungarians who arent right wing
We’re a rare sight :(
Well, it's a bit complicated
As Romania entered WW1 in 1916(?) They took us by surprice (then we did march into Bucharest tho)
Most likely why most people hate, or just don't like Romanians, is that in 1919( I'm going off of memory here) invaded us with the Czechoslovaks and the Yugoslavians
Now, as far as I remember, all forces had a demilitarised zone, but the romanians marched all zhe way to Budapest
Oh yeah, and probably Transilvania played a role in this ( as that there are about 100000 hungarians there)
Yes, Trianon is rooted deep in Hungarians, it’s being taught since childhood
There’s a lot of Hungarians who are nationalistic and right wing, and want to reclaim greater Hungary
This being said, if we have to mention cliches: I don’t like paprika, nor am I over the moon about palinka
I am however a pit pessimistic (as most Hungarians) and I am not overweight (apparently we’re 4th worldwide in obesity rate)
The most people I talked to about this did want to get our 'rightful land' back
( bare in mind that they were older people)
Greater Hungary is a small brain ambition
Big brains aim for the restoration Austria-Hungary(in some form or other)
Yes, I forgot that
And it's sad that most people think like that
I've once met a Pole in Berlin who hated Germans
And when I told him I loved Germany, he called me a Nazi
I tried to understand his logic, but I failed
Its not that people dislike goulash
However its often seen as an overhyped stereotype, as whe have plenty of other dishes that are just as nice
And it gets eeally old really fast when everybidy always wants goulash
Not to mention bastardized versikns that one can come across in foreign lands - which are not goulash (which is a soup), they far more closely resemble pörkölt
Btw
if you liked goulashyou should try halászlé (~fisherman's soup), which is somewhat similar
And which spoiled me towards pretty much all fish soups i  ever eaten in south slavic cou tries
Otside the sterotype we have plenty of pasta like based dishes, and wide variety of vegetable stews,and soups (which are too often missing from other cuisines)
And naturqlly we share some stereotypical popular balkans stuff like stuffed cabbages ...etc
It's nothing special, there are much better but less popular dishes in our national cuisine to be honest
But in general, I don't really like too much paprika, too much grease and I don't like it if a food makes you unable to do just about
anything after you eat it, and it bloats you
Lángos is like this, too, so it's a rare occasion when I have it, but at least it tastes good
That's understandable I guess
But I'm pretty sure the younger generation doesn't give 2 fucks about taking Transylvania back lol
> the cradle of our nation
Were not the Principalities the primary site of forming the Romanian nation both culturally and politically
Yea
as I said, I was going off of memory, and my history teacher wasn't that great
Talking about annexing Transsylvania, or any other territory is just a plain fucking stupid agenda, that politicians pull out of the hat to pander to idiots (then again, EVERY nation in the CEE has those)
But as Hungarians, visiting Transsylvania is a somewhat enlightening experience for us, to connect with our living ancestry, to experience a simple, more rural and raw aspect of our culture, and to get to know brothers and sisters from a diaspora far away
The connection to Transsylvania is and shouldn't be a political, but a personal, transcendental one
And I'm saying that coming from an almost fully  Schwäbisch-Slavic background
Csak a magad nevében beszélj
Forgive me father, for I have sinned
That's no excuse
I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying that gulyás is overrated
Because it is
I mostly like Hungarian cuisine
These stereotypes are more common in older generations and poor or lower-middleclass families
Are you - or is any other Romanian - a Dacian
The Vlach migration and timeline is supported by tangible historical (various royal privileges) and linguistic evidence (eg
Aromanian-speaking remnants all along the Balkans), as is the formation of the distinct Romanian culture and nation in the Principalities since the medieval period
While the Huns are a very interesting (and given the striking lack of any first-hand or archeological evidence, quite mysterious) people, no evidence points to a direct connection between either modern or historical Hungarians and the Huns
(There's also a lot of theories of the 'might have been'/'one cannot definitely exclude the slight possibility of' kind, but I presume that's the same with Dacians and Romanians
What is the distinguishable Dacian contribution towards Romanian culture, the Romanian language or the long history of the Romanian Principalities
I'm pretty sure Vlach, Slavic or even German and Hungarian strata could be easier to identify
What does 'it' refer to and how does a particular hypothesis having its own name attest to its veracity
>Are you trying to say Hungarians have a better claim over Transylvania
Perhaps
Are you saying that Romanians have no claim whatsoever just  because the Dacian influence isn't blatantly visible
That's a lazy  take
Are you saying that the Romanians as a nation came into existence  in the 19th century
Not a lie
Are you saying that Romanians as a  people didn't exist before the Middle Ages
Wrong
So, what is your  discourse
I'm discussing your previous claim that Transylvania is "the *cradle* of the Romanian nation". Nothing else - I am especially avoiding the claim business
It seems that neither the language of, nor the precursor polities to the Romanian nation were formed in Transylvania, nor the earliest or most important cultural, historic (etc
) achievements of Romanians were accomplished there, despite of well-attested and long-term presence of Romanians
>As for cultural and historic achievements, do you honestly believe all  of them went on record when Romanians in Transylvania weren't the ruling  population
What makes Transylvania the cradle of the Romanian nation, especially *over the Principalities*?
>As for cultural and historic achievements, do you honestly believe all  of them went on record when Romanians in Transylvania weren't the ruling population
Records pointing toward Romanian national identity forming in the Principalities are some way evidence that said national identity was formed not only elsewhere, but under comically terrible, horrible oppression
What's the point of getting over the top with this
Using the phrase '*the* cradle' does, in fact, single the referred object out from all other objects (incl
the Principalities)
'*A* cradle' - or an even more neutral phrase expressing its significance, eg
'an important place' - would have been clearer and would have probably avoided the verbal exchange altogether
>where you don't have tone of voice, inflection, mimic and other non-verbal cues
Yes, this certainly did not help
> I didn't mind the exchange itself but it felt like both of us were becoming slightly hostile towards the end
Shall we agree to both of us answering 'yes' to OP's question, then
A certain episode of the classic Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles comes in mind, where the four turtles ended up in Budapest, and the first thing they did was frighten a caravan full of colorfully clad gypsies, only to eat their goulash afterwards
At the end, Michelangelo made "Pizza goulash", which alone sounds like heresy
We also had a Macgyver episode set in Budapest
Actually, it was the first thing came to my mind when I saw the question
There were Arabs and camels everywhere, I think they confused it with Baghdad
I was looking for this comment
Si, certo, that was implied
Probably from Pamplona
Americans can't really make a difference between countries that speak mexican
(please don't hit me)
That level of heresy is intolerable
Okay, that's it
I call EXTERMINATUS
"OH, YOUR HUNGARY, WHY DON'T YOU EAT
How fucking many times I have heard that
At my grandmother’s funeral I met with her cousin for the first (and hopefully last) time
He was your stereotypical crazy “nationalist” type with his “big Hungary” badge (basically Hungary before Trianon) and shaved head
Anyway he proceeded to tell me one of the craziest conspiracy theories that I’ve ever heard
Basically he believes that the Hungarian was the first civilisation on earth and all great civilisations like sumerian came from them
The ancient Hungarians conquered Europe before the Roman Empire but they got bored and decided to see what was on the east
And they only came back to Europe in the 10th century
He wholeheartedly believes that this is a proven fact and the freemasonry is doing everything to keep this a secret from us
I'm not sure if it's a conspiracy theory, but many people im Hungary genuanly belive, that hungarians were the "creators" of mesopotamian, romance and egyptian culture
Many people also thinks that hungarians are descendants of an intergalactic civilsation from the Sirius system, and we are here to fight the lizard people
I guess this shit is comeing from the "Hihetetlen" (means unbelievable/shocking) magasine
It is a hungarian conspiracy magasine, and I'm pretty sure the creators doing this as a joke, but many people reads it unironically
Those guys are built a fantasy world, that created a whole sub-culture in Hungary
I have once read a theory that somehow ended up saying that Japanese people are the closest relatives to Hungarians
I don't quite remember how they got there (probably scrutineering both languages and finding words that are pronounced similarly and very minor grammatic similarities) but it was pretty crazy
That's only the second part of the story
The reality is that there were no humans on earth until we arrived from outer space
Our spaceship was lead by Prince Csaba ("Csaba Királyfi csillagösvényen"), and landed at the Carpathian Plain, which made a huge crater and caused the mountains to form
The engine of the spaceship is still here and acts as the heart chakra of the world
Hungarians came from the Sirius and fought against aliens over Crete at 12000 BC
By the way this conspiracy is real, I'll edit this later to link the conspiracy site from which all of these coming
some people think that these pyramids are built by Hungarians
Turbo-hungarians think hungarian is the mothertongue of all languages
Edit: They call it the ancienttongue, and they base it on the idea hungarian didn't change that much
The only problem is that we only have a couple of sources for early hungarian (conquest-1526) and non for pre-conquest hungarian
That's true that hungarian didn't change much, but the observable period is really short (around a 1000 years) and they only compare the language to english and german, when the ancientness of hungarian comes up
Yes we originated from planet Sirius
My favorite part is when the Dalai Lama was in Hungary, they asked him if the heart chakra of the Earth really was in Hungary
He smiled and he told that every nation wishes to feel themselves special but the real buddhist way teaches that these kinds of feelings are unnecessary etc etc
The next day he became a Jewish(!) agent in these kinds of circles
Just like Pope Francis later
Man, I wish I had so easy answers to every difficult question
I can’t believe he was skimping out on me
This is the best part
Yeah, the chakra is located near Pomáz, Pest county
Everyone here knows that
Jesus was also Hungarian as her mother is a princess from Adiabene, which is Sumerian and we have thousands of common words with Sumerian, and probably Sumerian derived from ancient Hungarian
Note: please don't fact check this as the Freemasons rewrote the history books so that nobody would find out the truth
I don’t think he said this one
I remember him saying Adam and Eve were definitely Hungarian and that the bible was mostly about Hungarians as well
So I guess he implied that Jesus was Hungarian
There are people (I met a couple of them) who actually belive that stuff
Their fandom is actually pretty big, and it's fun and terrifying in the same time to read about it
This is why we're so durable
The Black Sea was created by hungarians, and the Bible is just free-masonry propaganda created in the 19th century
I mean, obviusly
We are "joking" about reconquering translyvania, and sometimes slovakia
Of course
Hungary was cut down to like a third of it's original size in the Trianon peace treaty in 1920 (i velieve, not 100% sure its called that)
Well, Yes
Very much Yes
About any neighbour really
There isn't a Day where I don't here az least once that "Erdély(Transylvania) will be ours again" or "It's about time to reclaim the Felvidék (old name for Slovakia)". Some take this more seriously than others tho
Uhm, well I guess you could say that
One of my high school friends, was and is, a proper history buff, and in the first year of high school he showed me his plans for reconquering Transylvania, which he made in 7th or 8th grade
I don't remember his plans exactly any more, but I think they work
Surprisingly
In Hungary we only joke about the reconquer of:
Transylvania
Transcharpatia
Slovakia
Slavonia
Dalmatia
Croatia
Vojvodina
Banat
Partium
Burgenland
Muravidék
Rijeka
Dude, everyone knows Slovakia is not real, how could such a silly country be real, please
[Greatest Hungary] when
Can you please leave the Buda Castle alone this time
When did he said that sir
Wait till you hear some people even believe the Balaton to be real
Oh yeah sorry, i had a bad dream last night
Felvidék is REAL
Yeees
Viribus Unitis
Wow, some people are really naive I guess
Lmao hes just being an ass
Everytime he posts sth(literally from a nokia) there is always a map of the Hungarian kingdom
The neighbouring states take it seriously but noone really cares
The only reason I knew about it, its because I have a Belarus co-worker, and she wasnt able to connect to the meetings because of the situation
(They have some sort of internet outage
It is covered very well, like every news portal is posting some new articles about it (like about the riots, Putin congratulating, Germany suspecting etc) again and again
But I think there's not much interest in the topic in Hungary - the majority who like the reign of Orbán wouldn't support the wish and strife for democracy, and the rest of us are apathetic and hopeless, we know that these small protests and "riotettes" are useless against a dictatorship
A dictator will stay dictator until something global happens which turns the tables
The little to no consideration towards others in the name of protecting their personal freedoms
Like how it’s more important to some of them to own a gun than to stop school shootings or now with this idiotic corona protests to get a hair cut than to save others and their own life
Also the general attitud towards any kind of social help from the government
Capitalism (which seems almost worshipped by some people over there) is not gonna fall apart, just because you can get proper tretment for your illness without going bankrupt
And another thing which I really don’t understand: Are those gun nuts really think they could resist the US government, if it wanted to hurt/subjugate them
The US has the strongest military in the world, having 5 guns at home wouldn’t stop them
What i didn't seen mention before is the general friendliness towards strangers
Smiling at people on the street and going into small talk, it's nice but I can't help but feel wierd like "What do they want from me
The same is true for other countries and it's not unheard that the military did the bidding of the government and moved against the citizens who just wanted to protect their rights/freedoms or wanted a better life and protested for it
Also I don't think I have to explain to you how big the US is, it's not likely that the soldiers would have to kill their own neighbours or family, killing strangers is way easier
Is it really matters if it's an Iraqi teen or an American one, if the government says they are the bad guys
All in all, I just really don't see a situation where those guns could actually help you protect your freedoms and this argument for no gun control laws feels like some people not wanting to confront the hard truth and living in a fairy tale
I've seen pictures from Walmarts, which as far as I know is a supermarket where you can buy food and things like that, selling guns, so I don't know, if I believe in the "aren’t necessarily easy to get here" thing
I'm not saying ban all the guns, if you feel better, because you have a safely locked away gun in your drawer or you hunt as a sport, that's fine, but from the outside it really seems like the US government is not doing enough to prevent kids dying in their school and it's just chilling to me how people would rather have 20 guns than protect their children from dying in the middle of Math class
Anytime the mildest idea for a gun reform comes up, some people pretend it would be the end of freedom and democracy in the US, if they would have to go through some mental check ups or something like that before they buy a gun, my comment was refering to those people
It feels like wishful thinking
I imagine it's even worse, we are at least very social with people we know
>most people find Americans refreshing
Yeah I feel the same, but when you are walking in the street and the stranger smiles at you it feels wierd
You have to understand how ridiculous it sounds for non Americans that you can go into a supermarket and between the dairy products and the baby wipes you can choose a weapon that could kill a bunch of people
And again, I have no problem with people having guns, my comment was about those gun nuts who start shrieking everytime someone brings up that the US needs stricter gun laws
Wow, that's great
But honestly it would feel wierd to me
*even the norhterns are more extroverted then us ffs* /s
Ahh yeah, our only relatives
Depression
Lack of Vitamin D can lead to depression and suicidal thought
As we know, the Sun is a great source of Vitamin D. Scandinavia isn't the sunniest of places
Balatonfüred or Tihany
Lake Balaton is absolutely breathtaking
Hollokő, its a traditional town, where no buliding is older then 1920
I think Pécs is the "unknown treasure" city of Hungary
I would say Sopron (totally not biased because I live there) and Kőszeg for sure
Both are less-known towns near the Austrian border with a rich mixed German-Hungarian history and architecture
Kőszeg's old town is well-preserved and absolutely beautiful, and the nearby nature and hills also deserve a mention, it's worth a day-trip around it
Sopron is more known among Austrian tourists who come here mainly for the cheap dental and other services offered here, but it's not so commonplace to visit the old town, despite it's beauty
Sopron has quite the history and it's also called the most loyal town due to it's loyalty to Hungary which was shown in several occasions
It has a nice mix of Gothic, Baroque, and Austro-Hungarian architecture
Close to the city lies the castle known as the "Hungarian Versailles" in Fertőd which is also worth a visit
Vienna is only about an hour away, also close to Bratislava, and Lake Fertő/Neusiedl
I visited Potsdam last year and it was absolutely beautiful
Loved that city
Cor magis tibi Sena pandit
I haven't been to Italy sadly, but the cities Siena, Perugia, Gubbio, Foligno and Umbria itself are very well known for Hungarian readers, because a part of the novel _Journey by Moonlight_ by Antal Szerb is set there
(it's one of the more known Hungarian novels abroad, too)
Both of those are extremely popular though, when I went there it was filled with tourists to the core
the hungarian word for "kiss" (without tongue kiss) is "puszi"
its pronounciation is close to the English "pussy"
cringey and creepy pickup line idea: "hey girl can i give a puszi on your pussy
“Buzi” in Hungarian is kind of an offensive word used for gay people
“Buzi” in Hungarian is a derogatory term for gay men
Since we don't have another country with our alien language I would be more interested to hear about the Hungarian minorities' experience  from neighboring countries (Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, etc
> When growing up, I mostly watched Hungarian TV, but now I prefer Slovak channels (since our news are let's say
not censored)
Completely understandable, our news channels' content is literally North Korea-like propaganda meme material
>Yeah, and I was apparently brainwashed by leftist media and my  university
Fun times
I can relate to this more than I want to, welcome to the club
I have been politically brainwashed by a Computer Science degree and the Internet ruined my "national feeling". Apparently my grandparents left the Orbán train a few years ago, so it is better now, but the rising of irrationality is worrying
Ireland, especially the countryside
Well, English wouldn't be a problem, but I would love to know Irish
Iceland
I love the cold and I just want to fish while I grow old
Probably Finland
Finland for sure
Free wifi, better school system and I could go on
Happened to my aunt and cousin
My aunt, who doesn't really speak any language besides Hungarian, took her sons on a vacation to Turkey
At some point they went to the market and my aunt told my cousin to haggle for a rug since he spoke English, and instructed him what the max amount they are willing to pay should be
So my cousin starts haggling and the Turkish guy just says in perfect Hungarian: No no, your mother said she will pay [insert max amount here] for it so that's how much it is
They bought the rug
This is the first time a heard of it really, french deck is well-known and we have Hungarian deck (magyar kártya)
We use the Hungarian deck, wich is almost the same but with different symbols
The design was made in Budapest in the 1830s based on earlier German-style decks
According to the popular story the figures from the Wilhelm Tell story was a protest against the Habsburg rule
The rotational symmetry of the cards was that made it so popular in the region according to the wiki article
Can confirm, we call it magyar kártya
Yes, absolutely
I think that would be beneficial in every country
15-20 chilly (depends on how warm it was before), below 10 cold
* Above 22°C - short-sleeved T-shirt
* 15°C-22°C - pullover
* 5°C-15°C - thin jacket
* Below 5°C - winter jacket
18°C to 13°C: A cardigan will do fine
12°C to 7°C: A jacket on the thinner side will suffice
6°C to -4°C: I need a warm jacket
-5°C and below: I *need* my **warmest** jacket
Depends on what I call the seasonal cycle
for some reason autumn 18 C is warmer than Spring 18 C...
Cold Starts at:
June-November: Below 16 C
December-May: Below 20 C
For you
I would say that
25°C or more is time to be near some lake or pool to take a swim, 15-25°C is short sleeves an sandals, 15-5° time to take some light boots, long sleeved shirt & pants, maybe a hoodie
I will bring a light jacket from there up until -5°C. And below that its finally a proper winter, with a real winter jacket, where i start taking layers of clothes as appropriate
...ofc
i may not be representative of most people around here as i get the looks time to time,..
From the other end, it looks just as strange
Getting heavy physical dork done above 15°C is just a hot mess, i dont really get tired as much as too warm, like when you got a slight fever
I would say 5-10°C is ideal for physical labor
Some of myextended family grows pine for chriszmas trees and somtime i help them out
Frankly that temperature is the best for physical work, its stops being nippy, and gets very refreshing, and youdont warm up so much that you get "dulled" by it
There are no dark long winters
Here in my country we only had 2 days of snow in the whole 3 months
TWO DAYS
It was usually 5-10 celsius, rarely going into minus
Dude if you struggiling, just think about the guys up north, they need some respect
In Hungarian we use 'tökös' (has balls) which is an adjective and means that the person is brave or the person has pumkins somewhere on their body but I think the second option has never been used
Ever
Maybe in a context where someone was eating pumkins though
We also have 'töketlen'(has no balls)
It could mean that the person is clumsy, hesitant or a coward
Another expression with balls:
'Tele a töke' it means that 'their balls are full w sth
It's used to express that you've had enough of something, you're fed up
In Hungarian it means that you got kicked in the balls
And it happens
On national level, lesser evil only
On local level, we occasionally have independent candidates or candidates of local organizations I do believe in
Not in the "attend rallies and wave the flag" way but I do think they are fit to lead the place where I live
Lots of people smoke here, it's even popular among the teenagers
Although teens are more and more shifting towards the usage of vapes, juuls and iqos(-es
It is surely declining though, as in the socialist era almost EVERYONE smoked
In Hungary, smoking is so popular that the government nationalised the sale of tobacco
Now they can score big an a social problem
Not yet
You can actually buy Snus in Hungary now lol
In National Tobacco Shops
If I were you, I wouldn't try Siberia snus at first, try with something weak
The nicotine shock can even be brutal for regular smokers
My first snus contained like 43mg of Nicotine
I have never felt so bad from nicotine as  on that day
(I wasn't a smoker at the time though)
Yeah, they contain so much nicotine, it is no surprise they threw up
I tried that Siberia snus while having a gap lesson for school
I had it in for like 30 minutes, and then asked my friend, for how long I should keep it in
Imagine my face when he responded with "for first timers I wouldn't recommend more than maximum 5 minutes" haha
Yeah
now imagine some of those snus products contain more nicotine than a packet of cigarettes combined IN JUST ONE PIECE
If you ever try it, be careful, or you are gonna hate yourself haha
That's interesting
How is your Hungarian
Did you lean it
Are you planning to
Do you find it difficult
When in Hungary (or any place where a Hungarian might see/hear it) don't you dare make the hungry joke, or you'll lose all respect from Hungarians
Everyone of us has heard it a shitton of times, and no, it's still not funny
(Never has been)
Definietly these:
Slavs: NO
We are calling poles brothers for a differwnt reason
Easter European: NO
It's Central Europe, we even use CET
Hungry: it's something you pull the knife out, doesn't matter the place, time
Interesting
When you call a Hungarian Nazi a Nazi, those cowards always reject that "we're not nazis we're just national radicals".
There are people who say that
Look me in the eye brother
The official name of the NL in Hungarian is Hollandia, and we call your language and countrymen 'holland'
So, sad times here, sorry
Must be hard living in austria with all those kangaroos jumping around
Same here, we are CE bros
I think it's the most unfunniest because we are actually magyars and not Hungarians
:D only English is weird
Sorry serbian police here i have an arrest warrant
A much worse misspelling when ignorant Americans write Wiener as "Weiner". "Oh we don't have diphthongs, why the fuck should we care about other languages
I always weine when I see that
Just no
Germany isn't the Holy Roman Empire either
it's eastern only if you consider the Iron Wall as the delimiter bw East and West
however, if you look at it geographically, and just search it up on wiki, in almost each measures the countries in those area as central European
I'm glad you like it
I think that the hungry joke to us feels like, how calling the NL 'Holland' feels like to non-Hollander Dutchies
Horní Uhry
Dont you love hungary
Do you reject big hungary
Go back to romania you anti nationalist spy
how about the closeness to Hungary
how close do Austrians see us
The "Spanish peninsula" is called the Iberian peninsula, and Finland is not part of the Scandinavian peninsula
1920 Hungary (colorized)
but that assumes no Central Europe at all
I realized what it was called after I wrote my comment btw
The UN is like one of the most useless things on Earth
Classifying Sierra Leone as the "World's roundest country", while Africa is
Africa
Poland may be disputed, but the Czech Republic is as Central as it gets
The V4 countries are all Central
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but the NL's official Hungarian name is Hollandia
We don't really have the word "Netherlands". I guess Németalföld could go well, as historically it has been used, but that literally translates to "German Plain", so it doesn't really indicate that it's the Dutch we're talking about
Because that's the official name of the islands, unlike the peninsula, which most languages call the Iberian peninsula, or e.g. my language calls the Pirenees peninsula
> Honestly I don't see why being called England winds you lads up so much, it's only a name
I mean calling the Welsh English, is just as stupid as calling any non-English nation/country English
There are some group terms, like Scandinavia, which includes Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the Baltics, which includes Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Iberia, which includes Spain, Portugal and Andorra, and the British Isles, which include England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland
While alacsony ország does translate to low country, please trust me on this one, it sounds *ridiculous*, and in no way does it give us any clue that we are talking about the NL
I mean we have the word mélyföld, which literally translates to deep land
And we have the geographical name "Holland Mélyföld", which is a collective name for all the land in the Netherlands that lies below sea level
So not all the plains, only the ones below sea level
Our leaders know no limits
That the country I was born in is populated by pathetic morons who don't even realise that they are ruled by a megalomaniac psychopath which is a fucking burning shame
But their IQ level is not higher than their ego and expectations or their 2/3, aka 49%
Stop, I can only get so erect
I don't think I ever visited a country where half the women were topless on a normal public beach
In Hungary I'd say it's 10% at most
I think in Hungary the maximum was like 5% or less when it was fashionable, like from the late 80s to the very early 2000s. Nowadays it's virtually unknown, very few women sunbathe topless at lake Balaton
I literally have seen 0 topless women in my entire life, so I think even 10% is too much
It's the same here
The average salary was ~1000 € before taxes and a bigger box of Lego costs 100 €.
That said, most of my friends keep buying Legos for their kids as long as they can
When the kids become interested in PC or console gaming, that's when the nightmares start
Damn
That's kinda sad
Yes but it's a little complicated
It's kind of possible that your overtime only gets paid after three years, in specific circumstances
No habla Viking
Shakespeare and Chaucer are totally fine, Beowulf is 40%, and it helps that I know the text
I had no idea about the fourth one
Milton is a lot worse than Shakespeare though
We have three national holidays, two of which remember lost revolutions and independence wars (against Austria and the Soviet Union)
The third one is Foundation Day, the feast day of our first king, Saint Stephen
We also have the Day of National Unity on 4 June, the date when Hungary lost 2/3 of its historical territory and 1/3 of its ethnic Hungarian population
(Not a proper national holiday, but more of a remembrance day
When your country was occupied by foreign powers for half of its written history, there isn't really much reason to celebrate
[Ildikó Vida] Former head of Tax and Customs Office, she wanted to ambush the American ambassador with a question (with the help of some news reporters) about why she was banned from entering the United States
Only problem - she speaks no English, and forgets that she needs a translator
"No migrants more in
So stop them
Those who are in should bring back
So that's what the people will
" --- by our PM [Viktor Orbán]
My favorite is 'I am the people' by this self-proclaimed journalist
This one by Orbán was remixed about a million times, not too bad English but still quite bad and hilarious
Can we talk about the fact that a language certificate is required to get your high school diploma, yet politicians doesn't speak English
I think at least a 6
5 English and French should be the requirement to even be eligible
>I think at least a 6
5 English and French should be the requirement to even be eligible
Not necessarily French, but it would be preferable to have politicians who speak at least 2 EU languages
Imposing rules like that would be quite undemocratic, it's in our hands as electors to choose qualified people
French is the official NATO language and one of the EU commission languages
Just to name a few where it's useful for a politician to know these
Also imo setting basic requirements is not undemocratic, it's a necessity, a proof that you're capable of your job
Just like how a doctor needs a medical degree
Apart from supporting Germany in the Holocaust, i think the hungarians always opressed slavs when they had the opportunity to do it
I always taught the kidnapping the children and distributing them among loyal families in the Franco era is more famous
I've never heard of this island incident
The first one wasn't just about the Germans
It's pretty sad that the Beneš Decrees are still in effect
We actively participated in the Holocaust and still hasn't owned up to it
(In fact we've been getting worse at it lately, in the previous few years we've erected a statue commemorating Hungary's German occupation that depicts Hungary as completely innocent and blames everything on the Germans, and a government-aligned historical research organization called the deportation of some 10000 Jews at one point during the war a "border security operation".) Also at the same time we depopulated (read: massacred in cold blood) whole Slovak, Romanian and Ukrainian villages on the [Trianon territories] we reannexed into Hungary
It was pure vengeance, and thoroughly awful
EDIT: it should be noted that the population was just as enthusiastic about the Holocaust as the authorities
If the "blame it all on the Germans" tactic fails, it's common to leap to "blame it all on the gendarmerie". (Hungary had a separate gendarmerie at the time, it doesn't anymore
) In truth it was common for people to ransack the houses of their deported Jewish neighbors clean, sometimes before they were even put on the trains
When the few survivors returned they were often treated either with extreme hostility, in the "you were supposed to die, why didn't you fucking die" way
It was also common for people to feign shock at what happened to those Jews and then say their belongings got "misplaced" or "stolen" in the war - even though they were actually the ones who took it
the holocaust
The communist regime 1946-1953
The guy who leaded this wanted to copy Stalin's realm
> assuming you give us a pass for the nazi gold
hmmmm
watching it certainly doesnt hurt anyone, production does
Asereje was traumatizing, too
Adolf fucking Eichmann, of all people, testified in Nürnberg that several of his colleagues were shaken by the enthusiastic cooperation and the inhumanity of Hungarian authorities
Imagine that: Nazis find you too inhuman
*Top 10 pranks that went way too far*
Hmmm *looks at German killings/deportations looks at Hungarian killimgs/deportations* Hmmmmmmmm
Jesus, I didn't hear about that one at all
But here's another one: the [first anti-Jewish law] in Europe in the leadup to WW2 was ratified in Hungary, in 1920, 13 years before the Nazis even rose to power
Well I'll admit that this wasn't even close to being the most fucked-up thing to appear on the BBC
The children's shows of the last few decades lost a lot of their nostalgic value in recent years
Sure, but i doubt that anyone producing it can make a profit out of it even then
What I meant was don't act like the worst thing Czechia ever did was as innocent as trusting your own allies
Which is exactly why it would be insane to nuke you
Nuclear fallout does not respect borders
That was when producing it was legal
Clearly but we can't blame you: sticking it to the Brits must have been way too tempting
Doesn't 'Piątek wieczór' mean Friday night
Welcome from Hungary
Of course we have all the year cycle celebrations, but two old remnants which got associated with them:
- At Easter boys douse girls with a lot of water
Ancient magic to make the ladies make lot of children
By now it got corrupted and in practice means that the men of the family visit their extended family, the children get money the grownups get pálinka
The season of drunk driving accidents, the police usually has special actions to stop them
- New Bread
This is at the end of the summer, with harvest done, was a full on food sacrifice for the Gods, later to God, even later to the People Of The Hundarian People's Democratic
This old pagan tradition was called "Holiday of the Constitution and the New Bread" and was held on the 20th of August, in place of the old and current Saint Stephen (official founder of the Hungarian Kingdom)
[here is a communist truck float about an old pagan food sacrifice]
In Hungary some people dress in Busó costume in late february to chase away the winter
In Hungary it's mostly traditional in Mohács
This tradition has been practiced since the 15th century
• Throwing lentins at each other on New Years Eve (idk anyone who does this)
• On Easter Monday, we splash women with water and we get chocolate/pálinka (depending on age obviously)
• August 20, probably Hungary's most important holiday, we celebrate Saint Stephen I, the founder of the Kingdom of Hungary and the first Hungarian king
We shoot fireworks from the Danube on this day
We have something familiar in Hungary
The hungarian tradition for Luca day is to build a stool in a specific manner in the days preceeding it and if it's done correctly one can stand upon the stool on the 13th of december and see the witches
I know about this but never seen anyone doing it recently
Do we
I never knew about it lol
> unearthing the dead after 7 years to check if they are still dead
Why
Not that I know of
There is a split between Hungarians regarding our origins
1) The Finno-Ugric Theory
This is mainly based on the languages
Possible cognates, grammatical structures of the languages and so on
There are lots of similar basic (!!!) words and grammatical features (most relevant: no grammatical gender and the abundance of cases)
2) Turanism
This is the belief that we are actually related to the Turks, and the -stan countries and that we are actually huns
The whole shabang
This was started as a counter movement to the surrounding pan-germanism and pan-slavism in the 18-19th century
Turanists will tell you that the Finno-Ugric Theory was a propaganda and lie started by the Habsurgs, to rid us of our true origins and deprive our national pride
But here's the plot-twist: Turanism was actually started by a Finn nationalist, but now Finns are getting left out of the Turanist ideologies
Turanists have a bigger tendency to be far-right, and I've even seen someone say that "When I look in the mirror I see a Mongol not a European" which is obviously an exaggeration, because if modern day Hungarians took DNA tests, there would be lots of Slavic genes, due to the fact that we have been sandeiched between Slavs since the beginning of our European history
(This is coming from a Hungarian with blue eyes and blonde hair)
Regardless, of how persuasively someone might try to push their opinion, currently no one knows 100% what our origins are, but there are DNA tests being done on the Hungarian kings of the Árpád-dynasty, so we might have an answer in the near future
Yeah during ,,halotti-tor” we serve the deceased  food which can’t be touched
>strigoi
I should not have googled that shit wtf
Víz - vesi
Kéz - käsi
Vér - veri
These are also good
>moroi
Is that even worse than the strigoi
Them Romanians and their mythology
Does your mythology entirely consist of things coming out of graves
>ogres
Shrek is Romanian
Well most of our folktales are about sex, the others are about killing your siblings to succeed in life, or your siblings killing your animals so yeah
I think I see what you mean
YT channel: Hungarian Folk Tales
Basically, these are the tales I grew up watching on the TV
Watching them now hits completely differently then watching it as a child
I never knew they aired those in Romania as well
A Hungarian who is not bebaszva, mint az albán szamár
A Hungarian that pays taxes
A Hungarian who doesn't like goulash or any other national Hungarian food
A Hungarian who doesn't like paprika
Ohh yes, dear Hungary where nobody is alcoholic just "heavy drinker"
Hungary has a favorite toxicologist
Drunk as an Albanian donkey
He is a hungaricum
We don’t have genders so it’s just goes by “a hold” (the moon), “a nap” (the sun) or “nap” and “hold” simply
In poems though usually the moon is feminine, accompanied with adjectives relating to beauty, while the sun is more of a protective male (father even) figure, if you will
We dont have genders in our language
A nap - The Sun
A hold - The moon
Hungarian doesn't have gender differences in words we just say „a” or „az" depending on the first letter of the following word
None
In Hungarian, only people and animals have gramatic gender
All non-living things are genderless
Though in some folktale the Sun is addressed as male, and the Moon as female
Finno-ugric gang unite
I am not an expert on this field, but could you please give some examples of poems
I can not really recall anything like that
Hold, Nap, Föld
Celestial bodies are tulajdonnév.
That's funny af
Hungarian has no genders at all and the Parliament has just changed the law making transgender people impossible to change birth gender
If I had money you’d get a gold for this one
I’m also very far from an expert, just shared what I recalled from my studies / my impressions
Though here’s an example:
Tompa Mihály
A holdhoz
Hő vágyaim csak érted égnek,
Oh csendes éjek asszonya
Ha nem piroslik már az égnek
Felhőin a nap alkonya
"A Hold, ez ájult légi hölgy / csókolja a vad néger éjszakát"
Mondjuk ez nem "igazi" vers, csak az Esti Kornélban írja az egyik szereplő. Persze Kosztolányiból kinézem, hogy megírta az egész verset is, hogy aztán csak két sort használjon belőle a novellában
I stand corrected (even if I couldn’t care less about the spelling - sorry :D)
Yes, nap also means day and the t is usually an indication of the accusative tense, so this why it translates to good day :)
Erklärt es mir bitte (deutsch ist mein dritte sprache)
It's up to you, but why do you reply to a language question then

TIL
The golden ages of Hungary considered to be:
My personal favourite
14th and early 15th century the age of the Anjou Kings and Sigismund
The first Anjou king was a great diplomat, made treaties with Poland and Bohemia
During his reign begun the extraction of gold, silver and salt in Hungary
Hungary was the top silver producer for a long time
His son Luise the Great vassalized Moldova and Wallachia, counqered Dalmatia and had a Personal Union with Poland
He almost made a friendly kingdom in Southern Italy but his brother was killed
Sigismund of Luxemburg was Holy Roman Emperror and King of Bohemia too
Matthias I, the renesaince-humanist king of Hungary
Counqered Silesia, Moravia and Vienna
He made a peace treaty with the Ottomans what kept them at bay, and focused on western counqest
Reformed the tax system, and had a general who never lost a battle
He died without a son as most of our better kings, so his reforms didn't had lasting impact, but renesaince culture was thriving in Hungary until 1526
1867-1914
The "happy peacetimes". Hungary was a lesser, but almost equal part of a modern great power and the second industrial revolution was thriving
There were problems for sure (magyarisation, social inequality), but Hungary evolved with the world and wasn't  behind a 100 years
The first time is my favourite, because it was a true golden age with lasting impact, the other two were more like the last great times before our two greatest national catastrophes: the Battle of Mohács (1526), and the Treaty of Trianon (1920)
Edit: grammar
I think the 2 best periods in Hungary's history was
The reign of Mathias Rex
Austria-Hungary
Yes the happy peaceful times, from 1867 The Conciliation till 1914 basically the beginning of the first  world war
Exactly
Spoke from my mind
I appreciate this comment as it acknowledges the issues and oppression we did as a nation, but at the same time these were indeed the golden ages for us
What a shame we went down on the road we know now
Edit: I mean the nationalistic propagandist asshole of a nation we’ve grown into
I agree
But the dual monarchy is top1 on my list
>Everything up to Election Day 2016 seemed pretty golden
Well then your history eduaction was a complete success with its goal
It managed to raise a patritic man, who only sees glory
I would not say that periods like the coal wars, where local militias, federal personel & de fact mercanary companies massacred miners and their FAMILIES for striking, as something that can be part of a golden age
Or the US army bombing black protestors from planes when they demonstrated as part of a golden age
Similarly glorified robbing of technlogically inferior natives because "manifest destiny" & 'Murica fuck ~~yeah~~ you
is something that is disgusting for people in the civilized world
>Spoiler: real wages have not kept pace with cost of living, despite our national indexing system
...have you never seen a politician up close
Why the hell would you trust them to not alter data cosmetically to make themselves look better
It's always surprising to me, how relevant Báthory István was abroad
Neither Vladislaus I and Vladislaus II were headstrong
People say the first one often lost it
Stefan -> Estefan -> Estfan -> Estvan -> István.
I had only one really bad experience in Europe
We visited Romania with my family around 20 years ago in the summer
On the way home we had to wait for hours at the border
As we were moving slowly towards the border, we saw a minivan with and Italian licence plate on the side of the road and the driver was asking everyone for help
My mother speaks some Italian so we stopped and asked the guy what his problem was
As he began explaining, other people got out of his car and they mobbed us: began talking to everyone in my family in a mixture of Romanian, Hungarian, English and Italian, they were walking around our car, leaning in the rolled down windows, etc
We felt awkward but we (unfortunately) didn't tell them to go away
Eventually they went back to their minivan, my mom told us the guy needs something we can't help him with
On the other side of the border we realized that one of them stole my mother's wallet from the car
When I was in preschool we spent months in Greece every year
Our vacations were awesome but once when we came home the airport security stopped us
I was with my grandparents and my mom didn't give them a written document in which She agreed with the trip
Although I was young and picked up the language pretty well I barely understood anything
It was really confusing and scarry
In the end we could go home but I had to sit in the office of these airport officers and they tried to comfort me with toys and asked weird questions
I got a magnetic puzzle with cute fish drawins, I still keep it on my desk
I think I agree with you
I've been to Venice twice (Carnival and end of August) and it was, well, wouldn't say bad but not as enjoyable as it could've been
On the other hand, on my school trip we've been staying in a small town and did a trip around Lake Garda and people in the towns we stopped by were really friendly
I think the ice cream parlor in Malcesine even stayed open just for us, coming in at the last minutes
Or they were patient and waited for us to figure out the words/sentences we wanted to say in any of the smaller places, it was a fun trip
Luckily neither time we stayed in Venice; once in the small town with the school and spent our last afternoon/night in Venice before coming home and the other time in Mestre or Marghera
We used both times the old (mid80s) tour guide of my grandparents and went off the beaten path as much it's possible
Gondola rides are horribly expensive, other stuff I expected to be in the price range it was
Hot wasn't an issue for us
And the point of the school trip was to see the carnival (coincidentally we managed to catch the one in Verona, too) so it was unavoidable to have it packed with people
I even got a rose from a carnival-goer/cosplayer so it was worth in the end still
The gypsies stole the whole playground
In my home city Debrecen, a foreign student made a a song about [wheat grits] and it was a huge hit
Pretty much the whole country, except the capital, Budapest
That’s the only place where you would find tourists
Vigo was fun and cheap 20 years ago when I went by train
Then across the border to Porto
I bet you mean Ayers Rock (Uluru)
I would suggest Lake Balaton, it may be a little overcrowded during the summer tho
However I think around September it would be nice
Right now German, a decade or two from now, Polish
>Maybe we are not as poor and secluded as in the 90' and early 2000', but that doesn't mean we will suddenly be important enough in the EU
Not suddenly, but by 2050-2060
&#x200B;
>If we stay in the EU, of course, because half the voters don't care about the future of this country and it's citizens
I am pretty confident you will stay
Just like us
While anti-EU rethoric is great to gain votes from the conteo crowd, there are no benefits for people in power to leaving the EU
Thus representatives will continue their rethoric of "we must leave" to get votes and do nothing
And "half the voter" is alienated from politics, as the populist propaganda is very insulting to intellectuals
They do care, they just have no party they are willing to place confidence in
Yes, simply due to demographics
In a unified EU market, where there are no meaningful borders, its HIGHLY likely that a declining population of Germany - that has to support pensions - will lead to higher taxes
Lower population, means fewer workers on the job market, who - as a result - can demand higher wages
Poland simply lacks these issues
Regardless, until that problem arises - decades from even 2050-2060 - Poland will likely have the biggest economy in the EU
While i agree that nothing lasts forever - including economic might - Poland will likely have its own time in the spotlight
barring drastic unforseen changes like large wars, extreme pandemics, somebody conquering poland, humans transcending biological bodies ...etc
>there are around 39 million polish native speakers in the EU while there are 95 million EU citizens that grew up speaking German
There is nothing stopping people from learning polish
Like how nothing stops people from learning German
You are extremely removed from reality if you think that the majority of those 95 million are native speakers of German, and didn't learn the language out of economic necessity
And Germany has negative growth
Creating refugee camps - no matter how well intentioned - doesnt increase the workforce, when its surrounded by German burocracy
I agree that its a good cosmetic adjustemnt for demographic data
However people sitting for years in refugee camps are not exactly contributing much, regardless how (in)politically correct the fact are
It takes 4 years till legal restriction are removed
Even after that the way German dual training system works, won't make it easy to get a job
Basically all jobs require prior experience, which you get during un(der)paid internship
If you didn't go through said internship, for whatever reason, its a catch 22 situation, and you are basically fucked
Balkans is first and foremost balkans, small thing like religion take a backseat to stuff like extreme irrational hatred for all neighbouring coutries, consuming extreme amounts of alcohol and other balkans stuff
Thats cool as long as you dont have to work with foreign literature, then its an incredible pain in the butt
Ofc
its not THAT bad with planets, as there are not that many
Some madlad hungarians in created hungarian names for everything on the periodic table, thank god it didnt be ome widespread in use, like many other thing when this "create new words" was a fad
>People fry eggs with butter
This seems stupid but blew my mind, butter
Here we do It with olive oil
Here in Hungary, we use either lard or sunflower oil
>Most people know Pat & Mat
My childhood <3
I wanted to do that :(
And anime apparently
There are this scales about which country is doing what at different temperatures
My all-time favorite is "+5°C - Italian cars won't start". :D
It surfaces on meme sites like 9gag etc from time to time
If I find it, I'll post it
It's a hard question
Many are hated intensely by some, while others idolise them
Here are some examples:
**Saint Stephen, first King of Hungary:** He's respected by most as the founder of the country, but there's a small minority, who views him as a traitor to the nation's old paganic ways and as a dog of the Catholic Church and the Germans
**Andrew II:** He's not that controversial, I wouldn't say he's that hated either, although he certainly is heavily criticised
His reckless spending and overgenerous landgifts greatly reduced the royal authority and laid foundation for the later feudal anarchy
**Vladislaw I:** He's mostly hated for being such a huge moron, that he singlehandedly lost us one of the most important battles in our history, the Battle of Varna(1444)
When the Ottoman forces began to crumble, his overconfidence made him charge against the Sultan's guard, who surrounded and killed him
The Christian forces' morale plummeted and the battle was lost
**Louis II:** Generally viewed as a hedonistic good-for-nothing, who picked a fight with the Fuggers, when the country was in the direst need of money
He lost the Battle of Mohács against the Ottomans, and died while fleeing
Many others point out, that there was little he could do against the far stronger Ottomans, and he did what could be expected from him despite the ignorance and/or even antagonism of many barons of the country
**John Szapolyai/Zápolya:** He's definitely a controversial figure
He aspired for the throne ever since Louis II's father, Vladislaw II died
Based on that, many people think, that he purposely didn't participate in the Battle of Mohács, and let Louis II die, only to be able to seize the throne for himself
Well even if that's not true, when he lost the war for the throne against Ferdinand I of Habsburg, he pledged loyalty to the Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman I and became his vassal, who put him back on the throne of Hungary
This very soon led to the tripartition of Hungary, which led to many wars and the drastic depopulation of the country
There are many people though, who are not so keen of the Habsburgs
For them, John Szapolyai is seen as a heroic figure, who tried to fend of the rotten Germans while joining forces with another great Turanic nation such as us, the Turks
**Maria Theresia:** It is "common knowledge", that at the beginning of her reign, during the War of Austrian Succession, it was the Hungarian nobility, who saved her thrones for her
Despite this, she had the audacity to try to curtail the powers of the nobility and try to introduce changes in the name of Enlightement
Why do some people take it personally, that some nobles suddenly had a bit less say about political matters is beyond me
More sensible people respect her enlightened policies
There was really only one thing, which was actually really harmful for Hungary among her policies: Her tariff reform put up a barrier between Hungary and her Imperial holdings, which made the imports of crafted products into Hungary cheap, and the exports expensive
The opposite was done for agricultural products
Thus any possibility for the natural development of industry in Hungary was killed, and the social development of the country slowed down
**Joseph II:** He was an idealist, and a very forceful advocate of his own kind of Enlightement
He introduced German as official language in all of his empire, which directly sparked the national reawakening of Hungarians among others
In the end, he was forced to undo most of his very unpopular changes in the fear of a possible revolution
**Lajos Kossuth:** Many view him as a national hero, who led the Hungarian "Revolution and Freedom Fight of 1848-'49" against the vile Austrians, while others think of him as a complete moron, who:
\-Delegitimised the government, by seizing power with the OHB(Országos Honvédelmi Bizottság - National Home-Defence Committee)
\-Butted his head into military matters, which rarely helped
\-Gave Casus Belli to the Russians to intervene by dethroning the Habsburgs and declaring independence
**Francis Joseph:** Hated for crushing the revolution and for generally being a Habsburg, but he's also loved by many for the Compromise of 1867, and his long, peaceful rule until the Great War
Ah, yes, he's also strongly criticised for dragging the country into WW1
**Mihály Károlyi:** Nicknamed as the Red Count, he was a pacifist left-wing politician, who seized power after the Aster Revolution(1918
October 28-30
His and his government's pacifism and overobedience towards the victorious Entente and their allies made him a very hated figure, while the fact, that his political failings allowed the communists to take over is just like pouring oil on the fire
**Béla Kun:** Little is known about him personally by most people, but as the de facto leader of the communist Hungarian Council Republic, there's a strong hate against him
It is generally accepted, that the terms got much worse for Hungary later in the Treaty of Trianon because of the communist period of the country
**Miklós Horthy:** Very controversial figure
As Regent Hungary, he was a "strong man", an authoritarian figure, who contributted to freezing and even somewhat reversing the social development of the country in the Interwar years
He was also somewhat responsible for dragging Hungary into WW2, but given the circumstances, he had little choice
**Ferenc Szálasi:** A lunatic far-right traitor, who took over the country, when Horthy failed to withdraw it from the war
He was viewed as insane even by nazi standards and immensely contributed to the Holocaust and the destruction of Hungary in general
**Mátyás Rákosi:** "Stalin's best disciple", communist dictator of Hungary following the 1949 takeover
Hungary became one of the poorest country in Europe under him
The oppression and terror ultimately culminated in the Revolution of 1956
János Kádár probably qualifies
When you have to reinstall the security camera to stand furter from the grave because (some) people are still able to spit / take a piss ...etc
on it, thats probably a sign that you are a strong contender
(funny thing is that there are plenty of communist leaders who deserve the same treatment far more, but dont get it as he "reigned" the longest, and got stuck in the memory of the population
Hating on the ex-prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsány is a meme in itself since his resignation after his "we fucked up" speech (that got leaked), and the resulting mass unrest in the capital
Of course the current prime ministef Orbán also qualifies
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Some more historic examples would be Szilveszter Matuska, a mechanical engineer who had mass murder as a hobby, executed via derailing trains, with over a hundred vitims, between the 2 world wars
And Julius Jacob von Haynau also gives a run for his money - so to speak - due to his reprisals and his behaviour during the supression of zhe revolt of 45
There is a toast with beer "Bassza meg Hajnau" \~"Haynau can fuck himself" in reference to the supposed tradition of not drinking beer for a 100 years afted the defeat of 48 - only wine, palinka ...etc
Not the drink of those habsburg loving germans
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Imho
our first king should take the top spot, as - at least for me - mass murder, including ones one relatives, and erasing history by burning stuff qualifies
And doing so to converting at swordpoint is not defendable, even if you get to stick the St
prefix in ftont of your name for it
One would be Ferenc Szálasi, a fascist leader of Hungary during German occupation in WWII
He is responsible for the death of \~15000 jews if not more
He also sent kids and elderly people into hopeless battles against the Red Army
I can't comprehend how can anyone praise that moron
But really, why
What about Emperor Franz II->I? Or Conrad von Hötzendorf
As if he could've done much better
Poland's fate was already sealed, when the Prussians won the Seven Years' War
Do they care though
Yeah, I don't think so
Oh sorry, I misread your comment
So he's well regarded for his deeds, which he did within the territory of Belgium itself, but not what he did in Congo
Right
I teach Hungarian to foreigners
I have foreign friends who are very good at Hungarian
But none of them would pass as a native, not even after living in Hungary for several years
If you’re Slavic, your accent
in Hungarian will be much better than English speakers’ accent
Slavic speakers don’t have trouble with our consonants, only with the vowels
But the grammar is very hard with the ~18 “cases”, the many preverbs, definiteness/indefiniteness (foreigners just love to mess this one up), and then there’s the word order, which is not obvious and is very hard to master
Even if your pronunciation doesn’t give you away in the first minute of the conversation, and you even manage to use the correct form of every word, one tiny word order mistake and boom, it’s blatantly obvious to everybody that you’re most definitely not a goulash-gobbling lángos-loving paprikaphile
I would say it's almost impossible
Speaking fluent Hungarian as a foreigner with the same pronunciation and accent is a massive achievement
You can learn the grammar but I am yet to meet a foreigner who can properly pronounce "gy".
Probably impossible
Its really easy to recognize non native speakers
> I honestly have never even seen someone that didn’t live here from childhood that sounded even close to native
They always forget the potato, don't they
Actually, our pronunciation us kinda similar, but the grammar is different of course
Now I feel privileged
Are you agglutinating too
Sorry, this is the only thing I know/heard about the Danish language that stuck with me
Maybe you're right and it's really the only joke the other Scandies have
That's just tradition at this point
A lot of -stein names are now correctly pronounced as steen in American English
In the sense that this is the pronunciation you will find described in books, said by the most educated radio and TV hosts etc
It does differ from person to person though: Jeff Epstein is epsteen, but Bret and Eric Weinstein use stain
But anyway it would be shtain in German
Quick correction: The planet will survive, humanity won't. The planet endured far worse than us, but if we make this planet uninhabitable for ourselves than the people are fucked, not the planet
Otherwise, I completely agree with you
Poland and polish people for being absolute bros everytime I'm visiting
Thanks to the western european nato countries for helping Poland in the Poznan uprising in 1956
And thanks for the help in the hungarian revolt in 1956
And thanks for the help in the Prague spring in 1967
Thank you to Austria, for being the only country not to overstep the demarkation lines after WW1 and teying to annex more territory
And thanks to Poland for being the best brothers all throughout history
Iceland is like always the first to recognize everyone's independence
And Hungarian is left out lol
Nobody understands us .
Wish I could understand you guys
"Please" in English is also a shortened form of "if it please you", if I am not mistaken
If it grows too large, we'll make a new one with blackjack and hookers
I think most of us don't realise just how European we are until we step outside of Europe
Yes, I believe in the European identity
I don't think we'll ever become a state like the USA though
Our strength lies in our differences, our individuality, in spite of which we cooperate and work together to make all our nations better
We have disagreements and difficulties, but seeing things from so many angles has great value in my opinion
I'd say I am European first and Hungarian second, though I have difficulty imagining a situation where I would have to choose between the two
A common European identity certainly exists
However, there are also national, subnational and even lower-level identities (e.g. family)
Identities overlap
There have been numerous multiethnic empires in history
However, most of them crumbled in a few generations
While the nation state is a relatively new concept, it seems to be more stable than multiethnic states (e.g. France, Poland, Hungary existed for a pretty long time; the Soviet Union, the Roman Empire fell apart)
A "European Federation" seems no different - we can't build a European country on our love for pizza, schnitzel and fries alone, and constructing a shared identity, a common ground for hundreds of millions of people without a shared language, and with being raised wildly differently in each country is much more difficult than it seems
I consider myself primarily Hungarian, but I don't think that excludes having a European identity as well, in the same way that being a Hungarian doesn't exclude having a Budapest identity or a Catholic identity
I have been disappointed by my country and its people time and time again
If there is any "nationalism" I feel it's becouse I'm part of the EU
I'd love to believe that a European superstate is possible, however I think it is very unlikely, sinec nationalism is way too strong
I'd love the idea though
We would be much better defended from external and internal threats as well
I feel like that in Hungary and most of eastern europe as well, democracy is so new that people neither like it, nor responsible enough to aphold it
If the EU had the power to remove corrupted officials that were elected regionally it would be much appriciated
I just don't feel like we are mature enough as a nation to take care of ourselfes right now
Not yet at least
While I think it is kinda possible to maintain a multi-language state, I would rather like the official language to be English, or at least have it as something every citizen has to learn
It is already a great problem here, that only a few people knows english and they are very sheltered, since there is no real way for them to communicate with people outside their country or to get informed about the world
They mostly eat up some propaganda and be fine with it
They are totally disconnected from today's world, living in their national bubble
Without the people of Europe being able to learn about at least European matters, I don't think a centralised EU would last long
So yes, I absolutely believe in "European identity", I just think it is too early for it
We just need to get rid of nationalism, it hurt us too much in the last 100 years
I want to believe in a common European identity and in the European potential of (re)assuming the leading role in global matters
Half of my family lives in Belgium and i think the Manneken Pis (The peeing boy statue in Brussels) is really overrated, btw there is also a peeing girl statue wich not that many people know about
In Budapest the ruin bars
You pay a lot for drinking a shitty beer in a building too shitty to live in it
If you don’t speak Hunagrian they probably even scam you
In Hungary I would say Hévíz. Usually Russian eldery people visit it, it’s super expensive compared to other holiday villages (like Zalakaros or anywhere else) and has nothing to do except the thermal bath
Big European cities are overrated imo
I mean they are fun for a few day but i'd rather explore smaller, local sights
My favorite place in Berlin is the Potsdamer Platz
Knowing how it looked like before the war, how it looked like when the Wall was standing and how it looks today
I'm so glad they didn't try to recreate some fake old-fashioned buildings or such, but they erected skyscrapers like the building of the Deutsche Bahn
Another fun place is the Tempelhof airport, if you go inside from the S-Bahn station
Also, I love the name of the U-Bahn station Onkel Toms Hütte
I see you are a man of culture aswell
Romania
I personally don't hate Romania, but most of hungary hates romania, because they "stole" transylvania from us
Originally Austria or Turkey, but then *someone* took Transylvania
Romania
No hard feelings just casual hate
Our fellow Transylvania stealer eastern neighbours of course xd
Hümm
Nope
Nothing comes to mind
Definitely not anyone to the east
Nop
Well before ww1 the rivaly were Auatria and Turkey
After ww1 though
I just gotta say Romania
Even though it was over a hundred years ago that *that thing* happened
Some of our countrymen are still bitter about it
But there is no point in hating them
Its stupid
Damm like all of our neighbours
It used to be Austria, but now it's Romania
Romanians
Of course transylvanian people (basically also hungarians) on our side
Pretty much all of our neighbors
The bigger the border, the more we hate them
(Not me personally, just commenting on it
There are no rivals of the Great Starempire of Sirius
Exept maybe the Alliance of Reptilian Corporates
Romania
We hate them, for taking a big piece of our land
Interestingly, people seem to hate Romania the country, more than the Romanian people
Is it Turkey
Amen to that
Was looking for this comment
It's a thing in the past already, but truth be told, the Romanians of the time did play a bit dirty then and there
Wouldn’t be so sure about the no hard feelings part
Genius
Simply genius
oh my god I didn't even know they were both called Orban that is just amazing
Yea but remember what happend at Mohács in 1526
I don't have any problem with Romanians
I just hate on them by tradition
I haven’t even seen those two words in the same sentence ever
You see, Austria-Hungary wasn't exactly an actual country
Austria and Hungary were almost completely independent from each other aside from the shared army, foreign policy, these two's financing and ofcourse the shared ruler
This was technically true even before the Compromise of 1867 (with the exception of 1849–1860), but the absolutist nature of rule in Austria at the time made it difficult to distinguish between said country and the common ruler
Hence the false impression by many, that Hungary  was part of Austria
Anyway, in such circumstances of duality, the development of some sort of rivalry really isn't that surprising
No, that's a sporting event
I think you meant decathlon
Because reentering the war one day short of German surrender, violating the demarcation line and unilaterally declaring the annexation of part of a country really talks about chivalrous behaviour
> Part of a country that voted for uniting with Romania
Only the Romanians voted, since that was the assembly of the Romanians of Transylvania
The Hungarians of Transylvania declared loyalty to the government in Budapest, while the Transylvanian Saxons only declared for Romania in January, when the writing was already on the wall
&#x200B;
> majority is Romanian
Sure thing, the population of Romania was 51% Romanian, but those 34% Hungarians and 15% Saxons weren't really given a choice
&#x200B;
> oppressed for hundreds of years by their conquerors
Opressed for hundreds of years
Magyarisation was a shameful thing for sure, but such thing only began in the 1870s and was quite mild until the Lex Apponyi from 1907
Already by 1914, the Hungarian politicans were increasingly more open to address the grievances of the nationalities, and when in 1918 the Károlyi Government got to power, the nationalities were offered almost anything they wanted beside independence
Never heard of it, we mostly pass out hugging the toalette
Croatians, how bad was the earthquake in the morning
Surrounding countries, did you feel it, too
Are there damages
We send our sympathy
Apparently, people could feel it in the Southwestern part of Hungary
EDIT: Hopefully the injured (including the 15 yo girl) will perfectly recover
Wish them the best
This is the live seismogram registered in _Becsehely_, small village near to the Croatian border:  The spikes are very well visible
You could feel it on the northern beach of Balaton
My thoughts are with you Croatian and Slovenian sisters/brothers
Be strong, we are with you
I know it may not be the best time to joke, but
It's a Székely (secui) joke from after 1977
The Székely goes for a visit to Bucharest after the earthquake
When he returns to his village, his friends ask him:
"Did you see that plague of God
"Yes
And also his wife
Well it's not a good joke then if I have to explain
The friends meant the ruins caused by the earthquake; but he meant Ceauşescu and Elena as the plague of God
_The Székelys are a subgroup of the Hungarian people living mostly in the Székely Land in Romania
EDIT: there is a genre of jokes about them
Usually, they are portrayed as simple thinking but cunning people of the mountain
Home office on a slow day makes it fast
Btw, it's a pretty common surname, too
>London
I think this city underwhelmed me the most of any that I've ever been to
It's just
meh to me and I also found it quite ugly and not very nice on the eyes in relation to most of its architecture
Food is good though
I wouldn't say its "ugly" there are plenty worse
Its just not a particularly nice one in terms of architecture as far as cities in europe go
Or maybe i am a bit spoiled by Budapest, idk
What surprised me the most is the travesty of a public transportation they have
Like you hear that there are gazillion underground railway lines, rich country ...etc
you suspect something good, or at least better than in the balkans
Nope
Its small, cramped - compared to the lines around here - extremely, i mean EXTREMELY overcrowded
And the prices are absolutely ludicrous
Yes, people earn more
However a monthly travelcard (that as a ticket to every public transport for a month) is \~350£, here in budapest you get the same thing for \~30€. And minimum wage is 450€, while \~1500€ in the UK (so adjust cost of living accordingly), that 350 pound pass is damned as hell expensive
And its the worst for people who earn the least, as they are who need public transport the most - and ofc
its also good for companies, as it allows cheap labor to be able to get to the workplace
Yes
And its a bit sad, that too many of the asian population centers with extremely beautiful architecture got abandoned and destroyed
And its extreme shame what happend to tenochtitlan (current mexico city), as it used to be the Venice of americas rivaling the biggest cities in europe in terms of size, population & architecture
Well budapest is not "soulles commie architecture" by virtue of being simply to big to demolish and rebuild in the - at the trime trendy - so called "brutalist" architectural style
Most of those beuitiful bilding built (or renovated) in the classicist style were built at the end of 1800s &  early 1900, in a truely enormous area
Smaller cities in my country often got that tratment
Like the main street of my hometown (\~50
000) where all the nice buildings along the main street got either completely demolished, or all the decorative elements were removed
On the upside finally they are in the process of being slowly restored to their pre WWI era state
I think it is
“kurva” - in Hungarian and basically all the slavic languages
“curva” - in Italian, Spanish and Portugese
Polish and Hungarian
"Kurwa" in polish means a prostitute, while in hungarian, "kurva" is a synonym for your mother
I always find it amusing when I hear commentators during the Monza GP in Formula 1 talk about a particular corner on the track called the 'Curva Grande'
German "Sahne" apparently means "cream" while Turkish "sahne" is "stage" (like, a concert/theatre stage), imagine my amusement when reading "mit Sahne" on a dessert packaging (I don't speak German at all)
That sounds really similar to Hungarian _dinnye_ which is melon/watermelon (can be any kind of melon)
Ooooh pastel chalks
I loved those when I used to draw
I don't like Hungary, because the politics is pretty fucked up, but it is an Eastern European country, after all
The leaders do not spend money on what they should (for example iirc, there are 6 football pitches in Mezőkövesd, a town)
The opposers are really weak separately, and they do not want to co-operate for the most part, so to sum up, we have a "dead-end" type of politics
I would like to move to the Netherlands, because the people are really nice, the quality of life is much better and the whole country is gorgeous (the Hague amazed me the most)
So right now, I'm doing everything to get there, I study a lot to have good grades and I even study Dutch (but it's just Duolingo, so it's not that much)
Thank god I have an advantage because I'm only 13, so I have a lot of time to master my skills
No i hate it because of the government
I want to move to the UK in the future, if possible
I feel very uncomfortable in Hungary, so yeah, sooner or later I'd like to move out if I happen to survive my depression
I don't know which country would fit me best
Maybe I'll try several, then decide where to settle, I don't know
I like living here, but in the future i'd like to move out somewhere to experience other cultures
I hate most things about my country, and I am considering moving to the Netherlands
I do, however like the town I live in, and I love having lots of family nearby, so I'm quite torn on the issue
I like living in Budapest, but I very much want to live abroad as well
Due to work I have some friends from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and I really want to explore, to improve myself
I think it adds so much to one’s character and personality to live abroad and experience another area and culture
I studied in Turkey for a couple of months too and being a socially awkward mess I just ended up as the most lonely person possible
It was tough
People are friendly and VERY helpful though, indeed, I loved that
It's just that, I didn't make any friends - are foreign student group wasn't too big and with Turks I've always felt like an outsider/intruder
It was a weird experience
But hey, at least there were cats
Also, the weather pretty much cured my autumn/winter nose bleeding problem that I had at home
And of course, I still miss the food
And the kitties
And my uni
I agree with all you said about our politics
So many damage has done to this country, no idea how much time it would take to fix it
Hungary is beautiful, and its land is very fertile
However, being sandwiched between Austria, Germany, Russia and the Ottoman Empire has not made our lives easy
Also, our current borders have basically no defensible position if our neighbours would attack us, we have no mountain ranges on the border anymore
The Árpáds could have wandered a bit further west into Europe, we could have had a much lighter history (but not as heroic :-) )
>Doesn't snow that often during the summer
LMAO
》Imagine being one of the geographically most blessed countries in the world
》Imagine still complaining

So it's like a French version of Northern Ireland
That's fair
No, it's a reference to my hometown Székesfehérvár, Fehérvár for short
The "-i" at the end means the same as "of" in English
Peter Fehervari's surname might be also related to this city
Some of his ancestors probably lived around here and/or possessed some estates in the area
Well, the most intricate one was from a humor magazine in the '90s called "Kretén", where there was a questionare what a young manager would say in the given situation to excuse herself
The direct quote was *"Kivonszolom a beleimet, és megkarcolom a fajanszot hogy megreped"* which can be translated as:
*"I shall now drag my guts out, and scrape the porcelain until it shatters

Gee thanks, now I can never go to Darmstadt again, which is unfortunate because I visit there a lot

There was also:
\- **karimáig verem a révást** and
\- m**egyek a klotyira kicsi a rakást játszani,**
But one's almost impossible to translate properly, and the other's just "Going to the loo to play dogpile", which is not that extraordinary
Like in Űrgammák (other cultural milestone from the same period), "untranslatable drakvúf curse words".
Vielen Dank, dass du den Witz erklärt hast . :)
Wow, that show was BAD
Not in the cute, cheesy way like "Kölyökidő", but in a truly awful, "Szimat szörény" manner
I agree in the badness of Űrgammák, but Szimat Szörény was a different level

Awful
Back in the day lada was basically the only car here
And its still very popular
It's a little bit off topic, but I must post this:
This is a pretty old video of a Hungarian comedian whose main attraction was he could imitate the sound of various Eastern bloc cars and vehicles
Of course what he says in between is the funniest, but the sounds are cool, too
In order: Trabant (at the very beginning), Lada 1200 ("The Lada can consume fuel and oil in 1:1 rate" :D ), Barkas ("The fuel inlet is closed with a lock, who knows why"), a jet-ski, Wartburg ("The idling is special: there aren't two identical cycles" :DDD ), Rába truck (the best is the turbo and the handbrake at the end), Romet Pony (motorbike), Polski Fiat 126p (starts difficultly)
Yeah
They were really popular here up until the early 2000's. Even though they are quite rare now, I still see one once a week
When i say basically its because of course there was other brands but Lada was the most popular i think
How the eff is this so high
Of course it's not true
And why didn't you read the other comments
Trabant
Wartburg
Škoda
Dacia
Polski Fiat
Moskvich
Zastava
And you could buy Western cars, too (like Opel), it was just very expensive
What are you talking about
Lada was one of the medium priced and relatively bigger, relatively better cars from the variety, but it was far from being the only one
And it wasn't 1-2 years, but like 7
You seem very young
Trabants were popular too, and I saw a Moskvich too, idk how popular it was
Then you're very wrong
Reminder: Trabant, Wartburg, Škoda were also as very popular
Oh yea the good old *strandkorlát* blue Trabant
I thought I was straightforward agressive
:( :)
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa

Orban is overweight and a manlet so I wouldn't bet on him
Orbán is not really fit, but he would fight dirty, so maybe
Also our head of state is János Áder, so it wouldn't be Orbán who fights in this
They don't have the same cultural connection to it we have so it's probably that
Asian religions are probably really weird for them as well when portrayed from a western angle
But that's just a theory
I don't feel 'not-hungarian' but i also don't feel 'hungarian' either if that makes sense
I don't like being or living in hungary and i wanna move (i've lived abroad before and i liked it much better than living at home) but i guess i could fit in if i wanted to
Given how quiet and polite I am, how much I respect rules, and my love for animation, I'm pretty sure I was meant to be born Japanese
The brooding, slightly alcoholic, hostile Hungarian culture feels so alien
I think the same
I've got relatives living in Germany, visited them many times, and oh boy, that's a lovely country
Why don't you move
Why do you think that
I'm just curious
I wasn't trying to imply that
I simply mean, that my personality and values appear to be more in line with what is the general idea there
Yes, the stereotype
I don't feel like I fit the Hungarian one, so I look for others that feel more relatable for me
Obviously not all Hungarians are all the same pessimistic alcoholics either, I am example of the contrary, why would I assume that all Japanese are like the stereotype
We can say that stereotypes are bad and shouldn't exist, but then we wouldn't have questions like this or the feeling that we are not like our countrymen
Look into the states first and don't just pursue the "American Dream". Also no need to go that far when EU is full with opportunities
You are still 18
Have you been to any other countries in the EU to have this argument
You probably need to figure out what do you want to do with your life
Don't rush it
I think in Hungary with one of the highest rate of serious alcoholics in Europe (some suggest we have got around 1M out of 10M), it's rather usual to see people, especially builders have an equal amount of three-four shots in the morning to get over withdrawal effects
So you can imagine that seeing one drinking for the sake of getting drunk is a usual sight, but not really taken as normal or accepted though
Lol here there are a shit ton of pubs
Basically every 10 person drank alcohol atleast once in their life
Fuck it every 5
For 6 people 4 or 5 wine bottles isn't even that much tbh
Make it everyone lol, besides some baptists I don't know anyone who didn't drink atleast once
> Milk in bags
I passionately hated that thing, because it was so easy to cut the bag unintentionally
There are park and even playgrounds in Hungary with those signs
I mean TF
Where should they play then
There are still a few one here, but not that common like 20 years ago
Closest I've seen in Hungary is a graffiti on a side of a building that just said "God loves you". That's it, never seen that on billboards
Those are (aside from the standard ads) for political propaganda
now that is usually there in droves
Not entirely sure, but we did have thinly veiled anti-semitic billboards everywhere when the government was doing its stop soros campaign
Never seen one around here
Also, billboards are being more and more regulated out of existence
I still find it so awesome, that there are people, who actually can understand other languages without learning it
As a Hungarian, I wish
we do have a few common words with Finnish but even those need quite a bit of mental gymnastics to even see/hear the similarities
A direct result of some 3000 years of separation from our Finnish brothers and sisters :(
There is not such a similar languange exist that we can understand by reading, our one is very different from others
I know the closest relative languange is mansy, there are some similar words and also things we can understand, but we cant figure out the whole sentence
Here is some example, for fun, and also to other hungarians who didnt know this languange is exist:
Mansi:Hurem-szát-husz hulach-szem ampem viten eli
Hungarian: Háromszázhúsz hollószemű ebem vízen él.
Edit: yeah this pharse is understandable but, this is chosen to be understandable, so its show the two languange is similar and close to each other
None, we also hate everything that's not in hungarian and refuse to learn other languages
Being fair we do have some common words, like fish (hal) but man, I can’t make out anyone of Finnish and I expect you the same with Hungarian
Also don't forget to mention that the two languages (Khanty, Mansi) supposedly closest to Hungarian are small languages in Russia with ~10k native speakers combined so it's not something you'd randomly come across and since we've been isolated for so long there's probably no mutual intelligibility at all even with them
I knew of Mansi but never seen or heard anything in it before
It's not a language you'd commonly come across lol
I wonder how much I'd understand of a longer text but
Probably not much
Hungarian, Estonian and Finnish are finno-ugric, back in the nomadic days we were in the Uralic mountains (the mountain that separates europe and asia) then slowly migrated to our current location,so you could say that Hungary took a wrong turn there
Yeah its not common at all, and unfortunatly there is only 900 native speakers left
There is a youtube chanel called "i love languanges"
They have a mansi video i think, maybe you can try it there
K assimilates to kh, and from there to h - as I said, needs a bit of mental and some linguistics gymnastics
Edit: I realise I said the mental and linguistic part in another comment, my mistake
Homemade alcohol
Everyone who owns a garden with fruits growing in it makes alcohol, be it wine, liquor or spirits basically every family prides themself on how good their wine or pálinka (spirit with 60+%) is, and tries to share it with anyone willing to drink
If you’re ever visiting Hungary, don’t turn down pálinka if offered, it’s our form of being hospitable to strangers
Same here in Hungary
No one makes better alcohol and sausages than Grandpa
An unexpected pálinka can hit harder than a truck
There is a hungarian song called „Pálinka dal“ which is solely about how much the guy loves pálinka, maybe you can relate to it
(Don’t know whether it has a translated version somewhere
We usually watch out for each other, so hospitalizations are rare, but it’s not uncommon to drink until you can’t walk straight anymore
Yeah
Thankfully that's not true
The people making the goods, usually seniors, watch out for people drinking it
Sure, they love to see them make funny expressions if they are not frequent drinkers, get a few laughs out of it
But letting someone drink themselves to a level where they just straight up collapse is insanely rare
The best wines are the ones without label here, winery has a long tradition in most families
Our family gathering revolve around a never ending circle of who’s homemade we try next, so i can’t complain
You can’t tax something, that doesn’t appear in the books, aka why eastern europe is constantly broke
I don’t know what poitín is, but it’s basically moonshine, just the local version
If you’re persistent on the fact you don’t drink in general, they let you off the hook, but they’ll still be a bit disappointed
Like when your friend wants to show you their new car, but you don’t care about cars, they’ll be a bit disappointed, but they’ll understand it
Not that i know of, but i live on the far western side of Hungary, so perhaps they are more prominent on the eastern side close to Romania
That might be true, but we tend to warn them about how strong it is, also unlike vodka, pálinka is usually only drank 2 or 3 times a night, even we don’t advise drinking more
Nah, all good mate, all good
Sounds like something i can start and end my day with at the same time
Can't say I heard of anything like that either
I live in South-East Hungary
In hungarian we call extremely strong alcohol „kerítés szaggató“, a fence ripper, and some only drink 85% pálinka, you could knock out a bear with that
Kürtőskalács
(chimney cake) u can get it for less than a euro (hands up nyugati 200ft Kürtőskalács) and
[lángos ] that's a must when you're visiting lake Balaton or the "waterpark".
I would rather say lángos
Displaying the flag is not uncommon
You can see a lot of houses with the flag
Not necessarily uncommon to have one (I have an EU and a Hungarian one in my flat on the walls)
I'm curious, is there an independence movement there akin to the one in Scotland
If so, how much support does it have
Where
I would say it's fairly rare
Not in Budapest, but in most other smaller towns you can't go more than a km without seeing one
Interesting
Then, if not else, it's not that common here in Fejér county, I would say
Yep
Thats true
Aside from official buildings, I don't recall seeing any here in northern Pest county either
Two pictures came to my mind:
[This] is the Chain Bridge blown up and the destroyed Buda Castle in the background in 1945,
[and this] is a photo taken at the Pan-European Picnic in 1989 when the border between Hungary and Austria was opened and many DDR citizens could get through and go to West Germany
We remember this moment as "when Hungary knocked the first brick out of the Berlin Wall
I was going to link this for Hungary, lol
Our teacher showed us this photo in history class when we were learning about the aftermath of ww2
It is certainly powerful
By a Hungarian photographer
The government's idea that "Women are vessels for the brave Hungarian men that they will birth
Have as many kids as possible, but 4 is the minimum
If you have 4 kids, the gods will grace you with a 3% tax reduction
Well, not like you'll see a workplace for 15 years if you have 4 kids, but who cares
Have as many children as possible in the worst conditions as possible so they will be as poor and as stupid and as gullible as you are
You're not a human, you're just a woman
In 1993 'Duck Tales' was interrupted to announce the death of Hungary's first freely elected prime minister
The experience had a huge impact on the kids who were watching it, some still find it haunting 20+ years later
Did something similar happen in your country
It happened in the evening, at the time only 2 tv channels existed here and millions of people were watching it
The show was interrupted right at the time when a cartoon duck was screaming at the top of his lungs 'A SEA MONSTER ATE MY ICE CREAM
' Then Chopin's Marche Funèbre started playing for a few minutes
Then there was the announcement, more music then the show continued
I wasn't even close to being alive at the time but as I watch it, it still has a very unsettling atmosphere
For many people who were young at the time this is the most vivid memory from those years, and this became a unique experience for an entire generation
If some of my info is incorrect, please correct me I'm not 100% sure I got everything right about this story
Did something similar happen in your country that had long lasting impact
Here's the clip for the folks who are interested:
EDIT: wow this happened more than I expected
I've heard about a TV channel hijacking in the USA, I don't remember what it's called, but it's creepy
Saw the Challenger explode on live TV when I was 6
Saw the  Ceaușescu execution when I was 9
...and yeah, I saw the aforementioned Duck Tales episode live too
I remember this
It made headlines in Hungary too, my cousins and I spent the evening at our grandparents' place, who happened to work with a Turkish company, we didn't care/understand much but I clearly remember some of the footage from the streets
Wow I didn't know about the Swan Lake thing, maybe it was only in the Slavic USSR countries, but I remember that one of the of the biggest newspapers at the time announced Stalin's death with a typo in the main title, which kinda changed the meaning
It was supposed to be 'We're profoundly shaken by the death of Stalin
' but because of the typo it's basically 'We're deeply ordered to announce Stalin's death
Yeah, the ÁVH(State Protection Authority) thought that too, so the editor disappeared for a few months after the incident
It definitely could be a mistake though, the two words have only one letter difference
(Megrendeléssel vs megrendüléssel)
Not at all
On the contrary, peace feels a little strange and precarious
My parents always expected another major war, so I grew up with that
There are reminders everywhere
Even in my 20s, there were still a lot of WWII survivors who openly talked about their experiences
That war still feels very relevant
Of course, there have been wars in Europe since then
At one point, they said you could feel the bombing in Serbia fairly far into southern Hungary, and we had a lot of refugees
And look at what Ukraine is dealing with (and Georgia and Armenia, if you count them as Europe, which I do)
We are fine, too broke to try to restore anything lol
One interesting one we have is the *aranykorona (golden crown)*, it measures the **[fertility of land] An average land (in Hungary) is 19 Ak/ha (golden crown per hectares), and it can be an important factor in the land value
The golden crown value of a land is part of the officially records, it goes back to the 1850's, it was originally used to determine the amount of taxes to be payed
Somehow the system remained in use to date
Whole different topic, but something that most people don't know about is that there is an imperial horsepower (hp) and a german Pferdestärke (PS or capital HP), that are very close, but not quite equal (100PS = 98
6hp)
We use the German in everyday speech when talking about cars (the records are in kW ofc)
The *köpés* or *parasztköpés* which means a spit or a peasant spit
It has no measurements it just says if somethings close or relatively close
Hectare is a very common thing that many countries use
I just looked it up:
Hectare is only used for measuring land area
Not like house or something, only land area
Yo, i dont know how to tell you, but ... umm choose something else instead of Notre Dame
Am i allowed to say drinking
Irish does sound cool
In retrospect, do you think it was okay to be punished for speaking English
Personally I find it a bit harsh, but it's not my place to judge
Well we have palinka too which is a little bit stronger but i rarely drink it
I have to say that i love homemade wine which my friend makes, im not an expert in wines but it definetly has better taste than some of the wines you buy at the store
Definetly wine
Not a restaurant chain, but I would really love some currywurst places around here
We had the Belgian _Quick_ for a couple of years in the early 2000s, but they moved out
I still miss their food, it was very tasty
BURGERISTA from Germany
Alone for their apple barbecue sauce
I'm drooling now
At least one thing we're more advanced in than Norway
Yaay
Until then we have to make do with homemade stuff, at least it's easy to prepare
My grandma uses freemail
So everything she says she sends it in freemail
Nope
In Hungarian we use e-mail or mail if it's important to emphasize in the conversation how they're going to get the message
If it's obvious that it's going to be an email we just say "I'll send it to you" instead of "I'll email it to you".
Not really, everybody says e-mail or levél (mail)
But lot of people use "PPT" (of course like it would be a Hungarian acronym "pépété") as a synonym of a presentation which is cringe
OMG hotmail
Kinda sad that it is dying
1, Austria
2, Poland
3, Turkey
4, Romania
5, Germany
I was struggling with adding Croatia, Serbia, CzechRep, Slovakia, but as the post says the "whole history", I went with the whole timeline, and in the scope of how I have learned about them
Hungarian history teaching is changing significantly from year to year under Fidesz rule
The quality is deteriorating and nationalistic theories are starting to appear on the pages of state mandated history books, thanks to our minister of human resources (who are currently trying to put our late king Matthias the Just's bones together, because he thinks it will help the fight against the pandemic) Because of this others perception about Hungarian history teaching would be different
Byzantine Empire / Roman Empire
England / Great Britain
France
Poland
Russia
Poland
We had many shared kings, and our rules often inter-married, plus the whole history-long alliance and always helping each other in battles and conflicts
Austria
Matthias I of Hungary has conquered Vienna, plus after 1526, 1 part of Hungary was under Habsburg rule, and after the Ottomans were expelled, the entirety of Hungary was incorporated into the Habsburg Empire, then after 1867, we had Austria-Hungary until WW1
And we were the first country to topple to Iron Curtain on our border with Austria
Turkey (Ottoman Empire)
We had very many conflicts throughout history, especially in the middle ages, when we suffered a devastating loss at Mohács in 1526, after which the Ottomans conquered Buda, and a third of Hungary was directly annexed by the Ottoman Empire, while East Hungary (aka
Transylvania) became an Ottoman vassal
Croatia
We were in a personal union for 818 years, until the Treaty of Trianon
And Croatia is the neighbour we had the least amount of historical conflicts with, except for the 1848 revolution, when they sided with the Habsburgs
Russia
Russia helped the Habsburgs defeat the 1848 revolution
Then in WW1, we fought against each other, then in WW2, Hungary suffered devastating losses again at the Don river, then we became a sattelite state, and the whole 1956 revolution happened
Honorable mentions:
Czech Republic
Our kings made an alliance at the Visegrád congress, which is the idea behind the modern day V4 alliance
Then after Trianon, we had quite a few conflicts with Czechoslovakia, then the Vienna Awards and the Beneš decrees
(I know that it mostly involves Slovakia's territory, but Slovakia has only become independent in 1993, while Czechia (Bohemia) has existed for a longer time)
And this Visegrád alliance can also be applied for Poland's part, since the Czech, the Polish and the Hungarian kings were there
Germany:
Our first king's wife was from Bavaria, then the whole alliance between Austria-Hungary & Germany, plus the world wars, and we also helped Ossis escape to the West after the Iron Curtain was dismantled between Austria and Hungary
Do you learn more about Austria than Hungary
What do you learn about Hungarian history
Do you only learn about the history in the North or about the wars and the Golden Bull too
I think putting croatia instead of romania would be more accurate
I don’t remember studying a lick of romanian history
We definietly learn more about the Ottomans than Poland
I wouldn't put Poland on the list
Edit: I have been proven wrong
I don't think this is right
No Russia on the list
I personally wouldn't put Romania on the list, since our history really only intertwines after Trianon
Do you learn more about us than Turkey and Russia
>(who are currently trying to put our late king Matthias the Just's bones together, because he thinks it will help the fight against the pandemic)
You have an interesting list, and I love your approach, but I believe Austria is a must on this list
I also can't wrap my head around Britain
>the uter hatred towards hungary is felt thru all of our history books, and our constitution
Franciaország is sokszor megjelenik
Régen külön leckék voltak a Napkirályról, Napóleonról és a Francia Forradalomról.
Azóta, azt hiszem, XIV
Lajos kikerült az anyagból.
Poland is certainly in the top 5, even if not 2nd place
We had shared rulers such as Louis the Great and Stephen Báthory, Hungary had a whole Polish-Lithuanian dynasty, shared generals (e.g. Józef Bem), we were under shared Austrian rule (part of Poland: Galicia), the Visegrád Congress (1335), the Visegrád Group (after the Cold War), inspiring each others' uprisings against the Soviets, and general acts of kindness throughout the ages (e.g. taking Polish WW2 refugees despite disapproval of German ally)
Poland is certainly on the list, but Romania
Fair enough
Substitute Romania for Russia
I mean I've had my reasons for putting it on the list, but yeah, I've completely forgot Russia
Probably because as I went to school, Russia was kinda still the bad guy that fucked us up (thus we've kept our interest at a minimum), whereas nowadays we're somehow besties again
Depends on the interpretation
Romania as a kingdom
Romania as current day Transylvania
Yes
Most of the general ideas like enlightenment, industrialisation or colonisation are approached through Britain or France, but mostly Britain
There are also whole pages dedicated to England and Britain, like the Magna Charts, War of the Roses, Cromwell's rebellion is a whole lecture, than they are coming back and back again in the 19th century
If you think about it we don't really learn about Austria, only what they did to us
The only thing I can recall about Austria from history classes is that they were more industrious in the dual monarchy
General ideas and historical trends like general estate, colonisation or industrialisation are usually approached through British history or sometimes french
We also learn about the hundred years war, civil war and medieval England
If we look at the overall history of Hungary, I believe that Romania's involvement in that history is rather insignificant before the 20th century
Now I'm not saying that we didn't have anything to do with each other, since we did have interactions with Wallachia and Moldavia, but I think that none of those events are as important as WW1, the Hungarian-Romanian war, the Treaty of Trianon, the 2nd Vienna Award, etc
I guess you interpreted this question in a whole different way than I did
Yeah, your points also make a lot of sense
I thought the question is about what we learn in school, and which countries we learn the most about in school
Thanks for the unwanted passive-aggression
Yes, a thousand times
Some random nonsense that comes to mind
* Megacorporations will continue to gain power
They'll eventually outgrow governments
A movement to democratize corporations will appear
* The decreasing powers of states will lead to balkanization of Spain, the UK and the US, possibly others
* EU might federalize, but will continue to fade in power like the nation states themselves
* *Stopping climate change* -> *Reversing climate change* -> *Coping with climate change*
* The world might eventually start carbon capture, out of neccessity, to stall the rising CO2 levels, making space mining profitable
* Some parts of the planet might become uninhabitable
* Cities will overall look similar to today, just bigger in size
No flying cars
* Internet will be policed much more thoroughly
* AI will continue to improve
We will slowly grow used to AIs
There will not be an AI takeover/Skynet
* We will not crack FTL space travel, and focus only on our solar system

We have an entire r/Fosttalicska
Well the Hide The Pain Harold meme originated in Hungary, so we really we carry it on our hearts
Not too long ago Viktor Orbán changed his profile pic on FB, which for some reason was worth giving [a news report] about, and without needing to say, this became a meme template on r/FostTalicska (Hungarian memes sub)
Also the Mézga Géza Drake meme, but I don't see it as much anymore
And don't forget r/SzarFurik and r/FostTalicskaUnchained
Also [Orbán Viktor]  and [Macskafogó screenshots] are popular too
Don't forget the queen of nyunyuka, Müller Cecília
Also the way too literal translation of memes, and of course Blaha
>Bojler eladó.
I'm Hungarian, but I've never understood why that's supposed to be funny
[Origin] for it
Köszi
(Thanks
Poland for sure
Maybe our languages aren't the same, but our history has shared a path many times
And (at least by my experiences in Hungary) we have huge respect for each other
Poland, of course
We have always helped each other and this is true for today's politics as well (unfortunately we are both pretty bad right now)
There is a poem both in Polish and in Hungarian about our friendship
Hungarian one:
Lengyel, magyar, két jó barát,/Együtt harcol, s issza borát. (Translation: Polish, Hungarian, two great friends,/Together they fight and drink their wines
Idk the Polish one, sorry
Austria is still our big brother, and a lot of Hungarians want the empire back
But I don't think we look really promising for the Austrians
I feel like Hungary is the "annoying little cousin" of Austria
Another interesting thing I've heard is that we are great friends with Bulgarians
Nevertheless, I have never seen any examples to this, so I cannot verify it
So altogether Poland is first, Austria is second and Bulgaria is third, I guess
We don't really have neighbours that we are in a good relationship with
The problem is that nationalism is strong in Hungary and people tend to claim a bigger historical Hungary, which means they want back land from all of our neighbours
I'd say the closest we have to a bro is Germany
Historically, we shared language when we became a part of the Habsburg Empire, then we fought side by side in both WWs
We also traded a lot
German is also the second most popular foreign language here
It used to be even more popular, but as I realised recently people are reluctant to learn foreign languages
We both also had the same struggles, as we had nazi control with mass genocide, communist rule (even though only partially in Germany) and a loss of land and financial crisis as the result of losing wars
The key differance is that while German people accept their past and try to be better, struggling to have any nationalistic pride as a result, Hungarians are the opposite
We are strongly nationalistic, deny any wrong we did in the past (for example:WWII), blame others for our fuckups and instead of trying to not be assosiated with racism, antisemitism and xenophobia we embrace them
Of course it's not everyone, but this is the common theme I got so far
In addition, Austria is our cousin
We are step-countries
Yes, Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian are all Uralic languages, but I dont think we have any connection other than that
Did he really say that
I hate him even more now on
This feels like not getting invited to the cool kids’ party
Wow
I've been learning Dutch for 5 months and this was the first comment I fully understood
we are a raft of incels really
These are almost mandatory in Hungary as well
We do this in Hungary too
The groom has to do different tasks to win back his bride
Add our [emblem] on it, asymmetrically like on Slovenian and Slovakian flags, but a bit bigger because it's a complex one
I don't see why we shouldn't have it on our flag
I think the best redesign would be like [this post] but making the cross horizontal and putting red on the left and green on the right side would make it even better
The [Árpád-house flag] is also awesome in my opinion
Simple, but has more variety than the current one
Would change it back to [this]
The Holy Crown embodies the Hungarian state
A king, government, parliament, etc are just mere proxies to rule in the crown's stead
Therefor, having the crown on the flag makes perfect sense even if the country is a republic
but then again r/heraldry would praise it
The soviet one or the tsar's?
Yeah that was the old Soviet Emblem
We also had our current emblem but it was removed a few years back
You are right about the 1956 revolution
In 1957 and in 1989, Hungary received new coats of arms, but they were not included on official flags
Nowadays, you can find flags with the post-1989 coat of arms which are an unofficial design
I also prefer the tsar's
Amusing, absolutely unintelligible gibberish, mostly
Closest approximation I’ve seen is a drunk Finn trying to speak Turkish and Polish at the same time
A Thai guy once told me that it sounds like French to him
I've also been told by a French guy that it sounds like every other sound is an "e" (like in egg)
That's when I explained to him that " te tetted e tettetett tettet, te tettetett tettek tettese" is a correct Hungarian sentence
I’ve heard people say that it looks like someone smashed their head into the keyboard and hit enter
How can people talk like that
And why do Hungarians have so long words
They also say we talk way to fast .
A Polish friend once told me, that to him it sounds like Japanese
I like the drunk Finn analogy too tho
Somebody told me that it has kind of a medieval vibe to it
I've read on forums multiple times that some finns think hungarian sounds like japanese to them
That theory is considered very outdated and generally discredited though
Thank you poland for EVERYTHING
Poland
They are constantly supporting my country in EU politics
Thank you for starting the liberation of Hungary from the Turkish rule
Thanks Jan Sobieski
Thanks for Iceland for regularly giving us lots of points in Eurovision
We won't participate next year, regrettably

it's a house with a garden and a fence, not the american suburbs type where you just walk to the front door from the street without anything to stop you so i don't see the need during daytime
The door to our flat can be swung open by a breeze, so we have to lock it to keep it closed
I also feel safer like this
I know it's unlikely that someone would bypass the passcode at the entrance and then come up to our level to rob us while we are present, but it doesn't hurt to be pessimistic

In Hungarian it would look like this:

There is a party called "Mi Hazánk Mozgalom" (Our Homeland Movement), and recently the party's vice-President shredded a book called "Meseország mindenkié", in which children could learn about acceptance of gay people and stuff, because it quote-unquote "propagates LGBT ideology to children and brainwashes them".
But her actions kinda backfired, because with that video and whole scandal of shredding the book she boosted the book's popularity, so yikes
Covid, and SZFE (University of Theatre and Film Arts) protests
The students blockaded the building and there was a protest a few days ago because the government wants to put it under the financiation of a foundation (instead of the state) in whose committee they ignored all the recommendation of the university staff
They appointed people who the university students and teachers find not suitable for the job and straight up hostile
They claim that this is a move by Fidesz to eradicate the independence of the institution
Fidesz claims that they are too illiberal and leftist therefore they want to reform the institution
Not just LGBT people, but any ethnic or disadvantaged minorities like disabled people or single or alcoholic parents
These are kind stories (sometimes versions of original stories) where the characters happen to be from these groups
They should help children who aren't from the best background or are bullied to accept themselves
Acceptance of oneself is the best weapon against these bitter nazis, so no wonder they are scared of that book
That's a bit of an exaggeration, but yes, it is quite warm for late October
This is what I heard, but:
For humanities: ELTE in Budapest
For sciences: The University of Debrecen
Well, not uninteresting per se but Germany always draws the short straw with me
I decided to go multiple times and then something *more interesting* always popped up last minute
Belarus
No offence, but
it's just there
I don't know anything about it
(Other than the recent happenings against Lukashenko's reign
Not mentioning countries I know nothing about
I’ve been to many European countries
Out of them I found Slovakia to be the most uninteresting
It’s just eh
A bit might even be depressing too
Sturovo, Bratislava, Kosice, I was like yeah okay whatevs
Sorry, not trying to offend, don’t have anything against the country, just answering the question
ukraine is definetely a shit place, at least the parts that are close to hungary
i mean if poverty is interesting from a touristical point of view, i guess not but otherwise
I really like Slovakia
You guys have many great castles, and cities, all connected to hungarian history
Pozsony is also amazing and the girls there are really hot
One of your towns near Pozsony is called Malacka what means Piggy in hungarian
The gold and silver mines in Middle Slovakia was the backbone of the Economy of the Kingdom of Hungary during the Middle ages
One of my great-great-grandfather was born in Nyitra to a relative wealthy italian family
He made a relation with a slovakian maid and they moved to Kecskemét when my great-great-great-grandfather disowned them
Edit: I accidentaly wrote my great great great grandfather disowned himself
My great great grandfather was disowned
>Malta
I don't know much about Malta but Maltese language is really interesting
Well its only there pretty recently so thats somewhat fair
Its had 5 years of independence between 1917 & 1922, then its is own thing since 1990
Lukoshenko has ruled that country since 94, so 26 years out of 30 (or 26/35 if we feel generous)
slovenia is a hidden gem but if you're not interested in nature, you could be right
It has so many caves its insane
Place is like swiss chese
Here in hungary every fucking stalagtite and stalagtite is national treasuee, you are not allowed to touch it, or shine the wrong type of lamp on it
They discover 6-12 new caves per year
And i seen shops selling stalagtite
And ofc
Nazis used the drop them down (then drop a hand greande after if you feel mercyful) technique there
Sure they have a short-ish but nice coastline, however the interior is of the country is stunning
And sadly a single genocide sposored by the catholic church wasnt enough, to make people learn the virtue of moderation, its to be expected as its in the balkans, but still sad
Hmm i'm kinda happy you didn't mentiones us there
But I have to argue with you
The sea is just isn't that interesting
It's just, water, salty water
A Lake is just so much better
You need to go spelunking if you thunk mountains without sea are boring
There are ridiclous numbers of caves in the balkans
Places like the postojna cave system are a must see imho
And carst based river systems are also extremely beutiful, like the plitvice lakes national park
I'm only familiar with western Ukraine, but the Ukrainian Carpathians are gorgeous
Like, picture postcard idyllic
And Ukrainians are just generally fun to hang out with
Lviv is beautiful, although it still has a bit of the old Socialist-era grime
(I've only briefly visited Poland and Slovakia, so I can't really speak on those
Poland has the mine that inspired moria
That sounds something my group of friends and I would be into, thanks for the idea
Australia is just a buffer state between the Indian and the Pacific Ocean
I've been to Luxembourg City and it was quite beautiful
that does sound right up my alley
once covid is over i'm going then :D
>Austrian Hungarian empire, you know the place we spend hundreds of years with
AH lasted from 1867 until 1918
Before that Slovakia was part of the Habsburg Empire from 1526
Before that Slovakia was part of the Kingdom of Hungary
Before that Slovakia was part of the Great Moravian Empire
In 2018 they had one of the most creative stage shows without any fancy expensive equipment like pyrotechnics
It means something like this:
Municipalty of goats
:o brother
my name is comes from a Karl May novel (uncontiously, I thought I cam up with the name)
Depending where you come from inside Hungary
Sure you havd the nics transsilvania, however there are still some very pristine areas left on the great plain, in the forested hillls of the country's western half, the mountains in close to the northwestern border, and the swampy regions around the river tisza, the border with croatia slovakia, and the marsh region around the "little balaton".
Its not all just farms & artificial landscape (unlike the rgion that borders Romania)
Well its an intresting village
>Asian in an interesting way
Hmmmm
asian
Its interesting never felt asian
Except when I accidentaly walked into a chinese döner "restaurant" that felt asian
While you are at it poland also  with european bisons
Hungary is a buffer state between the Paprika Empire and human society
I'm in a similar situation with Ljubljana
Germany
Austria
Potato potato
I would say Tito is preferrable to genocide
There was a charcter whom (not real) name was Don Parmesan, I use that on many sites, but somehow it was already taken on reddit/ reddit didn't let me use it
Therfore am I Sir Parmesan
I dont know the english name
In hungarian it is: Az inka öröksége (something the Heritage/Heirdom of the Inca)
However nordics lake karst cave systems, if i recall correctly outside iceland they lack geothermal lakes, sand dunes ...etc
Ofc
they have other nice stuff
Just because their landscape is more exotic to you, doesnt make it somehow "better".
>Btw did you know that pretty much all Estonian kids read read "A Pál-utcai Fiúk" at school
WOW no
Why, because we have related languages
If so send me some Estonian poetry/literature, because we dont really have time for international literature on literature class (except the esential greeks, romans and latins) I liked it as a kid, it has an interesting story
My bad
My main point is that the fact thatstrictly hierarchich catholic organisations condoned (if not recomended) their members for participating in genocide, then later gave asylum for them should reduce blind faith
Which it did not
No, I dont speak slavic languages
But good to know :D
Well I think there is like 3 interpretations for cute  (source: am a girl)
When said about an action, phrase etc: it’s positive
It can be sarcastic but it’s rarer
When said about a guy (in a romantic context): mostly the meaning is I’m not attracted but I’m being pushed to form an opinion and trying to be nice about it
When someone’s calling a girl cute: really depends on the tone, can be positive but sometimes there is the undertone that it means naive/“too innocent” to get something
Soo cute is a complicated word
Better use something with a clearer meaning lol
They also say it when nice gestures are done (giving flowers etc)
Our governments purpose is to funnel Eu and Hungarian tax payer money to oligarchs and people close to the government/Orbán.
We're officaly the second most corrupt country in Europe, but we must have paid much to not to be the first most corrupt
Yes
The Government is a big maffia
As I know, a few years ago, Hungary was the second most corrupt country (at least in the EU) and that is only because we paid Bulgaria to be the most corrupt instead
Orbán is a corrupt asshole and he is running our country to the ground
Fuck him
I saw recently an article that Netherlands is the least corrupt country
Partially true, partially it isn't.
You see most tenders won by Orban friendly corporations because there's literally no other corporation that can do them
Sure, some western company would be able to do it, but for the same or higher prices
While those western companies also take all the profit out of the country with them, while national companies at least invest some of it in new constructions
Do those companies get shittons of profit
Of course
Is there any other choice
Not much
Each coin has two sides and we must see both to make informed decisions
Bulgaria
I have to disapoint you, but there are other worse countries than yours :)
I think it might be [Gyöngyhajú Lány by Omega] It's the most popular one too
Nah, it's Numa numa
Moonlight Sonata has to be it
I live in Budapest commie block
It's getting worse year by year, since the Homeless Law is enforced, a lot of them found my neighborhoods abandoned buildings
Alcohol and drug abuse is very common here, also begging and robberies are not rare
And I have to listen to their drunk screaming all night
I'm in Hilden right now, visiting family, what do you know about this town
Jeez, which part of the city
Csepel
Kőbánya
József Attila lakótelep a kilencben
I live in Óbuda in a classic panel and I have experienced none of that
I live in József Attila and we hear drunk screaming every night
Well some people joke abt that Lake Balaton dont exist
And obviously there are the jokes that say that Slovakia isnt real
Balaton
There is no lake Balaton in Hungary
It's a lie
Yea there is a joke that Romania does not exists
This is mostly trianon treaty related
(Explanation: (if you did not know already) a big % of Romania was hungarian (Transylvania, Bánság) and thats why
Well, we just say Romania doesn't exist
Does that count
Yeah but like 70% of your country will be underwater in the next 30yrs:( fuck global warming i wanted to visit
What’s Balaton
I’ve never heard of a place named like that
Oh wait, I remeber
My family disappears for a month in every summer to visit the Void next to Zala
Also, Csepel island is fake, it's an invention of the old communist regime so that they can fish there without the Soviet Union's knowledge
Lake Balaton is just an optical illusion and it became propaganda later
Seriously, there is a big FB group about it
Slovakia
Someone, who came from northern Hungary, said that they came from Slovakia
Their dialect is horrible, like they'd speak russian
Is "Slovakia" some slang term for the Tatra, or what
I know
Hmm interesting
Theres a county called Zala in Hungary
Edit: no its not a transylvania is hungary joke
Zala is in transdanubia
I've been there multiple times on hikes
Beautiful forests
Yeah i think it shows how hard the global warming can hit
I've heard that it was a nice region back then but then it went through desertification and it became the void we all pretend to be 'Balaton'.
Lol nice
Its actually Fertő tó in hungarian
I heard that slovakia is the english translation of felvidék
This is Zilah/Szilágy
Definitely not Máramaros, but with the various border-vacillations in the last thousands of years it can be both of the other two
Yes, they were manufactured at Area B (where Balaton supposedly is)
Spent way too much time with this, but here it is:

Hungary would be full with people called László, István, Géza, Árpád, András, Béla, Kálmán. Which is roughly the actual case
How do you eat Hungarian cottage cheese pasta
Some eat it as a "salty"/spicy meal (with bacon, pepper etc
) others eat it with sugar+sour cream
There are different names for the two
Late to the party, but still: do Greeks indeed use a singular looking form (gyro) of "gyros"?
I always thought the proper name for the food was gyros, and the Americans thought it's a fake plural form and took the -s from the end
Like they pronounce Porsche like "porsh".
On behalf of Hungary, I agree in the Schnitzel dispute
But there is one exception: there is a similar dish to the Cordon Blue where breaded, fried pork is stuffed with bacon and smoked cheese
That dish MUST include a topping consisting of garlic sour cream and grated cheese
In Hungarian, tomatoes are called "paradicsom" which also means "paradise".
Hold up
Is this something like the cases in Latin (and other Indo-European languages)
What is nominativ singular in this case
(reminder: Hungarian is not an Indo-European language, but we do use an analogue system of cases, only we don't have 4 like German or 7 like the Slavs, but 2x17
:D )
Well, I always thought of Hungary as a small country, but on a European scale, we aren't THAT small
I mean, we are smaller than Bulgaria, but we are bigger than the majority of our neighbours (only Romania and Ukraine are bigger)
We are also bigger than B&H and many other balkan states
And to go to Western Europe, we are bigger than Switzerland, Portugal, Belgium, NL, Denmark
And don't even get me started on the Nordic countries, like Sweden and Finland
Population-wise, however most Westerners beat us
I can't get my head around how 17M people fit in a country 40% the size of Hungary
(Talking about the NL)
And if something happens in Hungary, it'll only make it to international news if it happened in Budapest
But not a chance in hell any other city will be "famous".
And speaking of Budapest, that's the only city most people know are in Hungary
And some even confuse it with Bucharest and vice-versa
Just for the sake of context, sitting here, I can name and locate Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht and Haarlem on the map of the Netherlands
In Hungary we like to blame literally everything on being small
I wouldn't say Bulgaria is a small country, but a medium country
>And the one that boils my blood the most is being called a third world country
It's never ever meant as just an innocent statement
Well Jugoslavia was the leader of the "third world/non-aligned" movement
US and its allies were the "1st world", USSR and its group was the "2nd world", and the rag-tag bunch of others like nasser's egypt, Jugoslavia and the like were the "3rd world".
Its not necessarily and insult, its just people are fucking dumb, and never learnt history
Well then we have some thing in common with you here in Hungary
(pride in language, overexgarrated notion of uniqueness, being obsessed with foreigners knowing about us ...etc
Same size and population as Hungary
> arent any major events in the capitals
I mean a "major event" in the Balkan region usually has to do with a war, so it's maybe better this way
That's strange
I thought they must sell stuff like electronics with manuals in all official langauages of the European Union, like the manual itself is 3-4 pages long but it's thick as a book because of that
Luxemburg is not small, it's tiny
I would also add stuff like, since we are less known and people don't hear anything about stuff happening here, people tend to go crazy if even a little thing is about Hungary in an international setting, be that some sports achievement, famous people, companies, or anything culturally related to Hungary that make it to the mainstream Internet
I think that's probably a small country thing
Maybe also a bit of internationalism, like many people go abroad constantly cause every country is so close, and sometimes rely on neighboring countries
I remember being skiing to Austria and all the adverts on the lifts were in Hungarian
I live near the capital and I can be in Slovakia in an hour
People living in bigger countries probably don't experience this much exposure to other countries
The extreme other end was in the UK where I saw people view other parts of Europe as exotic holiday destinations and their cultures very different from their own, which I couldn't imagine doing here
Because it is small, even on a European scale
It's not a Luxemburg, but still smol
I mean at least you are all Slavic
They sometimes say that about Hungary "Is that in Russia
Don't worry that much about grammar
If you are a foreigner, and learn enough, to do "stupid hungarian" by simply using words without grammar, people will get most of it, and you will get respect for the effort
Ofc
if you plan to stay, then it will be a bitch
I recommend you the _Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook_ from Monty Python
My hovercraft is full of eels
(obligatory note: the "Hungarian" line he says is gibberish)
We consider ourselves small
Yes he is, why
Nah, everything east of Germany is Russia, everyone knows that
Even
Austria and Greece
I know but what does he have to do with the size of his home country
Man, you should have seen us in the 14th century
Iceland always gives us some points in Eurovision which we appreciate very much
But isn't Austria the country with the kangaroos
Oh my god, raccoon translates to washing bear here too
We call a raccoon a mosómedve
Can we talk about why Austria got territory from Hungary despite us both being part of the Axis
Wrong question
Cannot and won't be answered
It's just what it is and that's at least partly we don't have borders
Let's keep it that way
Isn't the reason for Burgenland's situtation that it was part of Hungary which had generally been less developed than Austria
Wrong war fam
Wrong war
Because this is WW2
Different war
He could have lobbied for us, too
In his later years, he spent much time in Hungary, part of his family still resides in Hungary, and he was much more popular here than in Austria
Joke from that time:
"How long would it take if (Nazi) Germany tried to occupy Hungary
"With resistance or without
"With resistance
"12 hours
"And without
"24 hours
"How so
"Because the welcoming speeches would delay them
Am I the only one who actually *UNIRONICALLY* listens to that
I love that song
Denmark is the new Germany
Highway D1
Construction started in 1972, we were told that the highway will be completed by 1999, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2013, 2026
Spoiler: It will not be
Maybe in 2030
The plan was to make a highway from Košice in Eastern Slovakia (Biggest city) all the way to Bratislava in Western Slovakia, basically across the whole country
At the early stages it was okay construction went fine, they slowly built parts of the highway, then in 2006 came (a corrupt prime minister that actually lead the country until 2019) Robert Fico, they promised that the highway will be done by 2010, 2013
60% Of the highway is actually done, but more than 200 Kilometres are still missing, of course its in Eastern Slovakia
Thats a short story about our highway that has been in construction for 48 years now and it will be 58 or even 60
Welcome to Slovakia
Recently read about a length of railway (on flat land) that cost more than if they had placed as many luxury SUVs back to back as needed to reach the distance
The flour and sugar f***ing ran out
Yes, and I'm so fucking tired of it all
I'd rather catch coronavirus than read another headline about it
I mean almost everyone is gonna catch it anyway, no amount of panicing and stockpiling is gonna save you
I'm pretty sure the panic is gonna cause more harm than the actual virus
It's not even that deadly
There's a joke going around that the cure to COVID must surely be pancakes, because people are buying flour, oil and sugar in bulk
That's been the case for nearly the past two weeks
It also shows how  piss poor supply chain management is in Hungary
You guys have that
Oh poor people
We had that like for more than a year, and it was awful
But then Orbán backed out when it seemed very likely that there would be an election about that
It shows that they are in control
They have the power to control your free time
There are loads of jobs which require to work on Sundays, so it's hypocritical to save the shop workers from working on the holy day
But not being able to do the shopping whenever you want is an inconvenience for almost everyone
You should always remember who's the boss
At least this was the meaning in Hungary
Yes
You know, if you move the cursor over the link, it shows where it goes
I always forget about important people
And aren't any better things to do than complaining about this
Gamer moment
Same tho
Gypsies have/had an affinity to pick Latin American names, after the Brazilian, Argentinian and Mexican soap operas that were very popular in the 90s and early 00s.
Hungarian naming laws only allow phonetic spellings, so you get a lot of Rikárdós, Ármándós, Dzsesszikas, Dzsennifers, Tifanis
Turkish soap operas have gotten more popular in the past decade, so maybe we'll start hearing about all those Kolompár Ibrahims soon
There are many masculine names, which have terrible feminine counterparts
For example there's the perfectly normal name of Márton(, Hungarian vers
of Martin)
The female version of the name just lazily slaps "-ella" at the end of the name and the resulting "Mártonella/Martonella" is a real torment for the ear
American sounding names in general, but especially when they spell it like it was Hungarian (eg
Jennifer --> Dzsennifer)
When a normal name ends in an "i" but they spell it with a "y" (eg
Fanni-->Fanny)
This is a recent trend: naming girls something unusual, like plants (Pálma, literally Palm) and fungi (Csiperke, literally Champignon)
I have a friend named Turul and he hates his parents for it
Some people are trying way too hard to give their kids Ancient Hungarian names
Like, an 8 year old kid named Koppány, or Ajtony, or a little girl called Sarolt
This isn't the Song of the Miraculous Hind, fuck, give them a normal name
I met a kid once who was called Vitéz. That's not even a name
It's literally just an old Hungarian word that means "warrior". It sounds exactly like if an English-speaking person met a kid called Warrior Johnson
One of his brothers was called Sólyom ("falcon")
Pretentious fuck of a parent
Acceptable exceptions are ancient names that are commonly used
Attila, Sarolt**a**, Csanád, Csongor, Hunor, Gyöngyvér are fine
In hungarian i think one of the worst names are Norbert for male and Laura for female
(Sorry Norbert's and Laura's)
Lol, randi means date in hungarian
Intresting stuff
and Molly
Tbf Arno and Hedda sound sorta ok
Is Ann-Nina pronounced Anina
The latter one is already a name, isn't it
Oh wait I completely forgot about "vityaz"! So it isn't even Hungarian in origin
Incredible
Yes, from it's Hungarian equivalent, randevú.
Ah, thanks, I didn't know the correct spelling
I think for Hungary the big ones are: The hologram, color television, and safety matchsticks
Ball-point pen, Excel, nuclear weapons, safety matches, dynamo, Rubik's cube, colour TV etc
Rubiks Cube (named after Rubik Ernő)
Atomic bomb (Leo Szilárd), holography, safety match, ballpoint pen, electric motor, modern computer, helicopter, Vitamin-C. **These are the most important hungarian inventions that we learn about in school, and you can also find proof on the internet
I'm not sure but I know something that probably all you have or had at home:
The rubik's cube
We made the rubic's cube, thats kinda cool
We also made the ballpoint pen (although some people disagree, im just here to say what the majority says)
Although not an invention but Albert Szent-györgyi discovered vitamin-C.
Tivadar Puskàs invented the telephone exchange
Although not a positive inventions, rather a destructive one
Edward Teller (or Teller Ede, we call him) invented the hydrogen bomb
Dènes Gàbor invented the hologram, wich is cool
We have 12 nobel prizes, the 16th most
And a moon crater is named after a Hungarian man Zsigmondy (just a fun fact)
For Hungary I would say the ball point pen
And there was a Hungarian involved in inventing the computer but it's not really Hungarian
I'm not sure about this one, since according to our overly nationalistic people every 2nd thing was invented by hungarians, but the principle behind the modern computer (if true) is the biggest hungarian invention by John von Neumann: en
wikipedia
org/wiki/John_von_Neumann
ballpoint pen
Made by Bíró László I believe
We also made x-ray (this is where the word roentgen comes from, originally röntgen
We also found a reliable source of c-vitamin in paprika, We also made the rubik's cube, We made safety matches, These were all made by Hungarians, just a lot of them were made outside Hungary by Hungarian people
Shame some leaders dont like it
Also helicopter, atomic bomb (Leó Szilárd was the first man that realized it is possibble to make weapons using nuclear technology, he also took a big part in the Manhattan project)
Vitamin-C, Electric motor, and a few more
The handwashing thing was Semmelweis' invention
Yes Yes, there are plenty
Well, they always tell us about these at school, the safety match was invented by Irinyi János (that one is a bit controversial tho), the holograms inventor is Gábor Dénes And The color tv-s is Goldmark Péter Károly
It was a team effort that involved quite many Hungarians
Sorry, I thought I had my user flair on even though I didn't. It's Hungary, the dynamo was invented by Ányos Jedlik
Not exclusively Hungarians, but a significant amount of the scientists of the Manhattan Project were Hungarians
Ah, thanks for reminding mate
Well, these are weird because both the color tv and the safety match were invented by many People simultaniously but we claim that we were the first ones
Also who could forget the Rubiks cube, and the documents we smuggled from germany to help in the construction of the atomic bomb
Yeah i almost forgot we have a dictator lol
Highway tolls
Booths, stickers, electronic registration, pay by time, pay by distance, getting fined right after crossing the border because you didn't buy it in advance
Big jumbled mess
Also, low/zero-emission zones are random even inside the same countries
Overall, the Vienna Convention could use a v2
"náci" és "komcsi" (nazi and commie) are used as insults but not in general speak just political "discussion". Are you say "ávós" is still used
Many Hungarians (that don’t miss the communist days) consider the communist government as an occupying soviet government
Ask a few ossies, the soviets were an occupying power
Both of our countries expressed our wishes of them leaving ('53 and '56), and they declined the offer quite violently
Szerintem az nem kötődik megszálló hatalomhoz
Hajjaj, messze nem
Amikor pl
a haláltáborba vagy munkaszolgálatra küldött emberek házát meg vagyonát lehetett "megörökölni" akkor komoly spiclihemzsegés volt
Sokkal rövidebb ideig tartott
Meg a kommunistáknak besúgással még a nyolcvanas években is lehetett sikert aratni, a németeknek/nyilasoknak besúgással meg nem annyira
Én is ismerek távolról embert akiről tudjuk, hogy spicli volt, de nyilván nem 44ben
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing
Crysis Warhead
The wiki page lists more but I've never heard of those and I live here, so I guess they aren't well known
We're not known for making games but at least we don't really get offical translation anymore either
Weeeee, here goes the independent gamers who translate games for us for freeeee\~
Imperium Galactica
(can't believe nobody else could post this)
ETS2 is probably my favourite game
I put more than 700 hours in ETS2 and almost 200 hours in ATS
There’s a great Netflix mystery/crime thriller from Iceland called Trapped
I’d highly recomend if you enjoyed Dark, but I prefer it to Dark
Has a unique atmosphere, beautiful shots, good characters
I first heard of it from Slavoj Zizek and he’s a big fan as well
i watched like 2 seasons, i liked the first one but it got more and more confusing over time so i dropped it
i don't really know anyone here who likes it but i've seen it recommended a bunch of times on reddit
Dubbed is so fucking shit
It is the normal in Hungary and there’s big industry for it, everything is dubbed
It has a bad affect overall on the level of people’s English too
Subbed is infinitely better
Thank you Austria, Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia for not being racist and not abusing Hungarian minority
Austria for helping us out every time we were in need
During the Dual Monarchy they helped to build our economy and rebuilt my city (Szeged) after it got destroyed by a flood
During the XX
century they opened their borders during the revolution of 1956 and has been helping ever since
They are generally good cousins
I want to thank Slovakians for helping me off a big ass mountain when I went skiing for 1 day and I thought that at the end of my first day I had big enough balls to go down on an intermediate course
Fuck me dude they had to call in the Snowmobile because it took me an hour to ski down 200m. They were understanding tho so cheers
Well, it’s complicated
Good question
Thank you Austria for carrying our ass in the Middle Ages
Without you (and your financial support), we would've been a part of the Ottoman Empire
As a Hungarian a I can’t relate :(((
We went with German influence twice, third time the charm
Are we good neighbours
We are like the German and France of Eastern Europe, frenemy for hundreds of years
Well she was generally evil
Haha, well I guess that depends on your political view
In my opinion if someone was fiecly against worker rights or the German unification is enoguh to be called evil
Especially since she was a damm talented politician
Well she opposed German unification, that's just a fact
>So did Mitterrand
Yes, but when the unification happened he was supportive
Don't misunderstand me, I see that the German unification was against British interests but I still find it sad that a this important person like her can openly be against the rightful unification of a country that was torn into two by foreign powers
I stand corrected, I learned even at school that she was strongly opposing it till her death and even called the Unified Germany a "monstrosity"
Márka is a popular brand of soft drink, kinda like Fanta elsewhere
It was made during the communist times, until the early 1990s, when, I believe, the factory was closed
It was resurrected in 2006 by a Hungarian entrepreneur, and now, it’s very popular
Traubiszóda or Traubi Soda
It's a carbonated white grape soda
It's even got a certificate of being kosher, so you can drink it at passover
When I was in Dresden, and asked for Almdudler, they stared at me as if they hadn't seen an idiot before
Kima is so amazing, by far the best soda I had abroad
Tell me, Faxe Kondi tastes so much like Sprite, are they related
I hate it
It is a worthless new feature that nobody likes
Well done Google, well done
it's absolute fucking garbage
i have Yt set to English (obviously), but now it translates everything to English instead, and that's almost as annoying as translating to Hungarian
Kádár is very interesting, because there is great nostalgia about his time, but it is never connected to communism
Like, saying "under Kádár things were better" is not uncommon, but saying you are a communist is totally taboo, I guess because the appeal of that system is that it didn't demand ideological devotion, just passivity
I have the feeling hungarians are not really concerned with communism from the economic angle like Americans, most narratives of it are either cultural (they were anti-christian) or nationalistic (they were Soviet puppets)
I don't think anybody wants Rákosi back, it's definately taboo
Horthy is also interesting
There were open elections, and most of the opposition was pacified, but Horthy's party only got 40-50% of the vote, so sometimes it's called a Limited democratic, or a Hybrid regime
Definately a lots of nostalgia for him, and I think Orbán also wants to recreate that period
To what extent is Horthy to blame for everything that happened under ww2 is still debated, and if you call out someone on praising Horthy expect a long, pointless debate spanning three decades of historical questions
The fact that he got overthrown by someone worse helps a lot to vindicate him, even though the main deportations happened under his reign, although under german occupation
As for Szálasi, that's pretty taboo, only unapologetic neo-nazies do that
There is not much to like about his reign either, he was a german puppet during the last strech of ww2
It's just that said neo-nazies are obsessed with this idea of honor and loyalty to our german brothers in arm (as if the nazies weren't considering us inferior)
People praise the hell out of both the fascist and communist dicatorship and not just the boomers
Not at all, on the contrary
Far-right is the most popular ideology in hungary, so our fascist ww2 leader Horthy gets a lot of praise
And, despite the fact that everyone hates communism, the last communist leader Kádár also gets some praise from the elderly from time to time
We as a nation are just not grown up enough for democracy, that's why we failed to sustain it every time
We can just hope it doesn't degrade much beyond this hybrid regime
Bitching about them is a national pasttime
Regardless if its bitching about goulash communism, or bitching about the Horthy regency
None of them is taboo tho
It's an open part of history, noone's gonna sush you down, or feel uncomfortable for talking about it
Absolutely English
It's partially how I learned to speak English in the first place, so it just feels natural that way
Also, translations of well known gaming terms like HP or Mana etc
can be pretty cringe
Most of the games does not have Hungarian translation
Soo
And most of the games that have Hungarian translation, it is bad
English most of the time, because of mod compatibility
I don't, and the best example I can give why is that in Left 4 Dead the special infected have DIRECT TRANSLATIONS of their names
Kinda awkward and funny, but I'd rather play in english
Maybe because of light conditions
Austria doesn't get dark in the middle of the afternoon, so there's less opportunity for them
Sure, there is night, just less of it in winter
That's why I said "less" opportunity, not none, of course
It's probably mostly cultural
Just never caught on for whatever reason
Anyway, I've been in northern Finland several years
For around a month around Dec
21, it just never really gets properly light
It's just kind of
murky
And Finns seem a little obsessed with lighting (for half the year)
The only explosion that comes to my mind is the explosion of the Biatorbágy viaduct in 1931, as a terror attack by Szilveszter Matuska
However, there were probably larger explosions during WW2
Before I even start, I just want to open by saying that I feel so much gratitude to be living in Europe in this day and age, when we look at each other as the same people, as **Europeans,** and not as the rivals our forefathers looked at each other
# Dear Slovakia & Romania
I would love nothing more than for all 3 of us to stop whining about what we did to each other 100 years ago, and move forward and actually treat each other like fellow Europeans
# Dear Croatia
To say the least, historically our treatment of Croats might not have been the best, but I want all the Croats of r/AskEurope to know that I absolutely love your country, and your coastal cities are the best places for any Hungarian to spend a summer holiday in
I swear to God it's cheaper than going to the Balaton sometimes
# Dear Austria
Of all our neighbours, you guys are the most civilized, and frankly, the most European
You are the country Hungary wishes to be, and the country Hungarians wish to live in
It's not a coincidence that Austria is Hungary's only neighbour whose Hungarian minority is constantly growing
# Dear Poland
The saying "Polak, weiger dwa bratanki" has been true all throughout history, and it is true even today
As of today, we are struggling together under a pathetic excuse of a government, and I can only hope that we can get rid of them sooner or later
LGBT-free zones
Where do these people think they are
The Middle East
Such places have no place in Europe
Love to each and every Pole on this subreddit
# Dear Finland & Estonia
Even though our countries are in no way similar, I still feel kinship with you guys, as we (arguably) speak a few of the most unique languages on Earth, but sadly our languages are the only Uralic languages that will survive in the long run, as others have no sole official status anywhere in the world and the number of native speakers are ever decreasing
# Dear Russia
To me, you're a whole other universe in Europe, and I mean that in the most positive way imaginable
Your cities have an athmosphere no other places have
Seriously, when I was in Saint Petersburg, standing in front of the Winter Palace I felt something I've never felt anywhere else ever
And going on the Transsiberian Railway is a bucket list item of mine
# Dear Greece
So much of everything we in the Western world know and love today has some connection to Greece
And Greek Mythology is the best thing I have ever looked into
Your history, your language, your islands, your cities, your cuisine and most importantly, your people
Literally everything about this country is as wholesome as it gets
Love to the Greeks
# Dear Ireland
Ireland has a special place in my heart, even though barely anything connects me to this country
But I've always thought that Ireland is a country everyone loved for no specific reason
You people are just awesome, and your accents, especially the **South Dublin** accent is the sexiest, and most beautiful English accent I've ever heard
Eargasm everytime someone speaks in that accent
And I've always loved the fact that Ireland is the only country to have legalised same-sex marriage via popular vote
I view it as the openness of the Irish
# Dear Netherlands
Without any intention to offend any of you, your language is the funniest thing I've ever seen and heard
I have had an acquaintance refer to the Dutch language as "English with Down syndrome". I want to know how you feel about this analogy
But on a serious note, I have always appreciated how open and accepting the Dutch society is, and I will repeat myself here, but I love the fact that the Netherlands was the first country in the entire world to legalize same-sex marriage
Best of wishes to the Dutchies
# Dear Germany
The reason I left you for the end, is because I have the most to say about you
I just want to start by saying that I have nothing but endless respect and admiration for Germany and the German people
The way Germany made a complete U-turn and transformed from the Third Reich into what we know and love as Germany today, leaves me dumbfounded
And from my experience, it is very rare for a country to be so open about the darker chapters of its history
And sure, with all the evidence, it would be pretty stupid for Germany to even try to hide this, but it certainly didn't stop some countries from denying past attrocities
(Not going to say names, but we all know what countries I'm talking about)
I mean even I had to find out about the massacres of my own country from English sources on the Internet, so there is that
Germany has definitely learnt from the past (something which I can't really say about my country huh) and today is the beating heart of Europe
Best of wishes to Germany, the other countries I mentioned and the countries I didn't mention
(I could've written a shorter essay on most countries in Europe)
>Hungary: you're kinda mysterious to us, but you've actually contributed to our culture and economy throughout history (same with Austria, Italy and France, even Czech Republic/Bohemia to an extent)
Most Hungarians I know love Croatia and Croats
>Bosnia: amazing nature
Bullet dodged
<3 aaaaaaw
>Hungary: thank you for liking us (for what i’ve seen) and for liszt’s version of La Campanella
Thanks for having supported us during our '56 revolution
Avanti ragazzi di Pest
But
You have a crush on Germany
*Throws suprise flowers into the trashcan* I get it
True heroes of Europe
>"a Hungarian enters a revolving door behind you and leaves it before"
Im not sure if I get the meaning right, but it certainly feels right ''':D
Well, there are some bozos here who still cry about the Habsburgs, but cross that bridge you know
Objectively speaking, Austria is our best neighbour in every aspect
Now why you gotta attack me like that
There's actually 4 milk bars in Budapest, which were founded on traditions of previous milk bars
They're pretty cozy and yeah once in a while I went in, asked for a dl of milk and then went on my way
We say literally “in the middle of nowhere” or “behind god’s back” or “on the world’s ass”. Or funny sounding made up village names, like Bivalybasznád, bivaly meaning buffalo and basznád meaning “you would fuck (it/that)”.
A bit late to the party but we usually use fictional place names that sound funny like Bivalybasznád (bivaly-buffalo basznád-you'd fuck it/that) or Mucsaröcsöge which doesn't mean anything it just sounds sorta funny
There's also "where even the birds don't fly"
Don't forget the best "a halál faszán" literally meaning on death's dick
Also "senki földje", which means no man's land
There's also "where even the birds don't fly"
Kukutyin is also used in a similar context, but it is also exists
It is because Kukutyin is at the middle of the Hungarian Great Plain, which is the closest you can get to the middle of nowhere
Its the calm before the storm I think
Our ER has been even quieter than usual in the last couple of weeks but it would be foolish to assume that it won't change at any moment
As far as possible the government wants to treat COVID patients centrally in selected hospitals which were emptied for them
The rest of the institutions need to prepare too with designated ICUs and infection wards, isolation rooms etc
too, but are not going to treat such patients until the capacity of designated hospitals is exhausted
As for workers we are now banned from leaving the country but there are no further special measures - yet
Elective surgeries have been restricted to oncological ones, the rest are put on hold to save resources
Clinical rotations of med students has been suspended
My guesstimate is that up to 30-40% of people showing up as "emergencies" in fact do not require urgent care of any sort
Nonsensical complaints, chronic problems needing no special immediate care, people treating the ER as a one-stop shop where they can get their regular checkup (say the magic words and you get all kinds of diagnostic tests and imaging immediately) - the possibilities are endless
Many of these people now probably realized that the ER is not the best place to hang around without very good reasons at this time
Also staff is now wearing masks and there were some suspected cases (none of them COVID) too
~~transylvania~~
Schnitzel is not an Austrian only thing, for starters
*Ffs its just a joke pls dont kill me lol*
Nether had we, but the larger half of Europe didn’t either
Joke
Thank you kind redditor
~~who knows actually~~
Sure I can't say for all countries of Europe, but I think we just simply don't need them
:-)
I read it somewhere that the US has these because it was easier, cheaper and faster to expand upwards, but European cities had time
> ugly
Debatable (and survivors bias)
I think it's more about city planning
I quite like many modern building, including skyscrapers and they look absolutely stunning and great in modern cities like NY
Or when I visited China the newly built city centres with modern building looked great
And here's a real unpopular opinion: I like brutalism
The Barbican Estate in London is in my top3 buildings ever
No, it's because the Chief Architects of Budapest consistently don't approve buildings higher than the Parliament, so the cityscape isn't corrupted
Don't forget, the banks of the Danube are under UN World Heritage protection
The MOL tower which is under construction will be higher, though, and it actually created controversy
I don't think they're ugly either
On their own, they look good
The problem is the incoherence in these districts
We liked art nouveau, because they are coherent, yet each building can be somewhat unique in its own
Then we went for a bland copy-paste brutalism that lacks any individuum
Modern districts are completely individualistic and deny any coherent style and often has little connection to the local culture
You walk along a a street and find glass and steel boxes, glaring twisting buildings, post art nouveau, minimalist buildings, post-brutalist buildings, green eco buildings
All on one street
On their own, they can all look good, but together they're just a chaotic mess
Because of this, most modern cities are similarly chaotic, which makes them all look the same
>The MOL tower which is under construction will be higher, though, and it actually created controversy
Yeah, building that is a terrible idea
>The MOL tower which is under construction will be higher, though, and it actually created controversy
Yes, but as you can see, if they want, they change the regulations
Not the first time they don't care about the World Heritage protection
(for example the Budapest's city park, or the Buda castle what I remember)
But let's not go into politics :-)
We truly don't need them
We have 3 "halfscraper" at Árpád-híd, and they use
50% of it I think
In principle its not a terrible idea, you can build tall thing without making the place into a desert of glass
Imho you could continue most of the inner city buildings upwards in the style one of the building near the nyugati pályaudvar (western railway station) is done in
The so called Eiffel palace is very far from an eyesore sticking out of the cityscape
[This is how it looks from the ground
[This is how it looks from the air
I don't see why continuing it upward in the same style would create stylistic problems
That wouldn't. As we can see on the image, the Eiffel Palace is only a few floors higher than its surroundings
The MOL tower would be 100 m higher than anything around it, and would be the largest building in the city
And it probably wouldn't be nearly as good-looking as the Eiffel Palace, or, with your words, it would be:
>a desert of glass
>an eyesore sticking out of the cityscape
Yeah it depends on the surrounding
I would still think tall building could be done with grace
There is no issue with glass, if the bottom levels are don in style with the surrounding classical buildings, and you have narrow street, thus you cannot be disturbed by the glassy top from street level
And higher floors covered in glass don't look stupid when they are not a one off occurence sticking out like a sore thumb in the middle of nothing
If that high building is surrounded by similar ones at lower heights it won't be an eyesore
At the location it will be built it could have been fine
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
At the end of the day its far enough from the center that its not any worse than the chimney of the Kelenföld powerplant with its 200m height
,,Aki bújt, aki nem, megyek
,,Anyone hidden, and anyone who's not, I'm coming
Hungarian:
“Aki bújt, aki nem, jövök!”
Vigyázz, kész, jövök! - means Ready, done, im coming
“Aki bújt, aki nem, jövök!” (Who could hide, who couldn’t, I’m coming for you
Kész vagy nem, itt vagyok
Aki bújt, aki nem, jövök!
Aki bújt, aki nem, megyek
(Those who have hidden, those who have not, I'm coming
Aki bújt aki nem megyek
(Hungarian)
Aki bújt, aki nem, megyek / jövök!
Who has hidden, who has not, I’m coming
It's exactly the same for us too: "Aki bújt, aki nem, jövök!"
Hungarian
Yeah, looks like the same
Im finding more and more simular things between us and you, austrians
My Mexican friends tell me that the Spanish mock them for the differences in their pronunciation, and the use of some words that are used differently
...its arguable that Austria is older than Germany, thus they should have the monopoly on the language
But the whole question doesn't make much sense
Do Austrians say "baba" for saying goodbye informally
OMG, we say "pápá" for the same
What do Slovaks enjoy about Borovička is beyond me
I don't mind a mild juniper flavor and I like gin enough, but that stuff is just Satan's ball sweat
The new laws banning "incest" in France
I mean it bans something, just not what you would expect
Don't worry, those are just nationalists, e. g. in Hungary an average intellectual does not have a problem with Romanians at all
Those greek buildings were covered in graffiti sincd ancient times
Its noghinb out of ordinary
Turkey is as much a "muslim state", as France is a "Christian state" - both practice a borderline militant level (from the US viewpoint) separation of church and state
When modern Turkey was created by Atatürk - among other stuff - he abolished the caliphate, basically equivalent of banning the office of the Pope
Yeah
So incest is fine and dandy - in the eyes of the law
And we made a law banning "incest" by redefining incest
The most french thing ever, i get that, but why
No, he didn't say that
Hungarian nationalists are in Hungary as well (how surprising)
I think he meant that these people are dumb, and most of the Hungarians don't think the same
But don't get me wrong, you can find Romanians who are hardcore nationalists and against us
Cellux - sellotape
Vegeta - a type of seasoning
Rotring- mechanical pencil
Blu Tack - putty like adhesive
Mirelit - frozen foods
Jacuzzi - hottub
Thermos (termosz) - vacuum flask
Edit: I just remembered the most important one
Matchbox - little toy cars
Toi Toi is a hungarian portable toilet brand, we also call it toitoi, I wouldn't even know what would be its proper name
But they recently renamed the brand to yoo
which is so bad in my opinion
Ngl I had no idea that mirelit and termosz were  brand names
And there is more
Like flex, zetor and stihl all three are brand names but we use them for angle grinders, tractors and chainsaws
There's also Tixó which is the same thing as Cellux
We also call styrene "hungarocell".
I didn't know it was Hungarian, but it makes sense, since _Toi Toi_ wouldn't refer to its purpose in other languages
Yup, both are "sárkány". Kites are usually referred to as "papírsárkány" = paper dragon
I have something else that's interesting:
In english, "glass" means the material and also the object you pour liquid into for drinking
In hungarian, "üveg" means the same material, but also means bottle
Both languages use "glass" as a material to describe a liquid container, just a different kind
Yeah, both are sárkány, althought we usually add papír (paper) in front of it when meaning kite
Hungarian: Sárkány
And I don’t think you can get much more of an unrelated language than Hungarian in Europe xD
In Hungrian dragon is Sárkány, kite is (papír)sárkány, which means word by word "paper dragon".
Climbing on statues and making grafitis on them (later one done by locals mostly)
Drunk Brits are the worst
I don't know for sure, but Soviet statues are a different story, they were an aggressor that ruined and occupied the country
Sorry, if I came off as a bit assertive, I did not mean to
Also what you ask is true, but it's also common to graffiti other statues by drunk teenagers who want to be edgy
Budapesti here, for the record for me it is not about whether it is the capital or not, but about whether it is a remotely cosmopolitan big city or not
I don't think vidék is used for people looked down upon or people who live anywhere but the capital city, most people in my town use the word for people that don't live in our town, so if you live in Debrecen you would still call people from Budapest a "Vidéki"
Debrecen is looked down because it's a shithole with peasants
There are actual cities in Hungary with real citizens (with the attitude of one) like Szeged, Pécs, even Győr or Sopron, Szombathely
Debrecen is just a pumped up village
I have to add that in "vidék" people rom the capital are looked down
For the "i know everything better" attitude, despite often having no achievment other than being born in the capital
I think it has different levels
Looking from Budapest, everything is vidék. From the county towns, all the smaller towns and villages are vidék. From the smaller towns, villages are vidék. It doesn't matter how far you are in vidék, there'll always be somewhere more vidéki than where you are
In my experience, in Budapest "vidék" means everywhere outside of Budapest, while here in Miskolc it usually means smaller towns or villages
Especially villages
Someone from Budapest/Debrecen/Győr isn't a vidéki here but someone from idk, Mezőkövesd might be
To be fair, some people are just judgemental assholes and love that "bunkó pesti" stereotype even if they've never actually met someone from Budapest, lol
And of course both people born in the capital and also those in the "vidék" tend to forget that many people living in Budapest are actually vidéki
So is that what that band is named after
I'm a big fan of a band that used to make a lot of covers earlier and found out that one of their songs was a cover of a song by said Irish band, but with different lyrics
Yes it was
I wonder why there, out of all places
Im from Hungary, and when i was about 10 years old I went to the Czech Republic with my class
And what do 10 years old kids do when they visit a county with a different native language
Obviously swearing in Hungarian, thinking nobody would understand
Back then we didnt know that "kurva" means exatly the same in Czech
My sister is a flight attendant and she's often put on flights to Romania since she speaks the language fluently
One time there were a couple of guys on the plane talking loudly in Romanian, making sexual comments about all the flight attendants, and what they would do with them
My sister then turned towards them, and in perfect Romanian asked them if they were ashamed of themselves
The guys turned red and stayed silent the whole trip
A couple of weeks ago I saw a map that showed the European languages that use the word
Here is the map that depicts the "Kurwa Empire": [Link]
Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, and Czechia used to be one country, so the languages had an influence on one another
For example, in Hungarian, we have lots of words that have a Slavic origin
The Hungarian language is unique and the people here are more or less proud of it, however, speaking a language that is a part of a big language family has some benefits
When I went to Italy earlier this year to Firenze, I felt basically embarrassed by how badly I dressed compared to all the people around me
Like holy shit it felt like I'm walking amongst models
As an example: we once visited the water park in Lutzmannsburg, Austria, and just walked across the border to Zsira, Hungary for dinner, then back to the hotel in Austria
No border checks, we took photos with the border signs
Germany here
I am living 20 kilometres to the Austrian border
Gas is much cheaper there so I always drive over to fill up
Cigarettes are like €1 cheaper if I'm out I buy a box
inside the schengen zone (EU, CH, NOR), you do not need a passport, an ID card is enough
Although nobody asks for it in normal circumstances
Very rarely there are some police cars at the border, and I am dealing with cars so I'm often driving with a dealers plate
They  like to stop me because of that
Once I took a friend of mine with me, and he forgot his ID
We had a control on the way back from German police officers, and my friend got citation for €25 but he was let into Germany
I have a few friends who are from Turkey, and if they are crossing the border they have to have the Turkish passport as well their German confirmation of residence on them
I was born in Hungary and I have a Hungarian ID
I often sell cars in Hungary, and sometimes I like to drive it myself over there and have a little "vacation".
After the lockdown has been eased (start of may maybe, don't remember well) there was a lot of police cars in the Austrian border, but I didn't see them stop anybody
On the hungarian austrian Border there was a huge police checkpoint and they stopped everybody
They asked if I was going for business or pleasure, if it would have been pleasure and I'm a Hungarian resident I would have gotten a two weeks quarantine enforced by police officers who would check up on me nearly every day at random times even middle of the night
Because it was business and I had the paperwork to prove it I could just drive over no quarantine no nothing (like I can't have the virus because I'm going to business trip)
If if I would have just driven through Hungary to reach other countries then I would have gotten a red sticker on my car saying Transit
Then I wouldn't be allowed to stop anywhere accept on gas station and parking lots which say Transit on them (and if I don't have the red sticker I am not allowed to stop on those stations)
###I steered away from the original question but **tldr** you only need an ID card and you can go anywhere no questions asked (mind you there is no pandemic going on in an ideal circumstance)
A lots of people in the western part (e.g. Sopron) works in Austria but lives in Hungary
So they go to a different country in daily basis
> Several years ago I crossed from Austria to Hungary several times in just a few days
My passport was checked by the Hungarians
That had to be before 2008 then
I drove in Paris a couple of times around Arc de Triomphe included
I didn't have any issues as I got my driving experience in Budapest where road rage is pretty much standard
"Huncut" which means "playfully mischievous", comes from the German word "hundsfutt" meaning "dog's vagina".
The word "minta" (sample or example) comes from Sami
A 18th Hungarian scholar thought that is an old Uralic word, related to Hungarian "mint a" (such as), so he introduced it into Hungarian vocabulary and it caught on
In fact the Sami word comes from Norwegian "mynte" (coin) which in turn comes from Latin and not at all an original Uralic word
It's probably the most random and unexpected etymology in Hungarian
A Latin word that reached Hungarian through Sami
"Vigéc" is a very old-fashioned word for travelling salesmen
It comes from German "Wie geht’s Ihnen
" (How are you
), because that is how Austrian travelling salesmen introduced themselves back in the 19th century
And to Hungarian it comes from Ottoman Turkish via Serbo-Croatian
One we use often that I know of is “muszáj” which comes from the German “es muss sein” basically meaning it is a must; it has to be
A huncut nem onnan ered
A “csirkefogó”, “gazember” jelentésváltozást, ami még a németben ment végbe kihagytam, igaz
[De végső soron a leírt eredet stimmel]
In Hungary it's probably German
There are people who learn/used to learn it as a foreign language instead of English and even more people who studied both
I think it's German, because a lot of Hungarians work in  Austria and Germany
Well pretty sure it’s German, because a lot of people go to work in either Germany or Austria (they pay them better there)
I can’t think of a second most spoken language other than English, but it doesn’t count
Actually more people speak and better in German than in English here
But it is very popular as a 2nd foreign language so probably a lot more people speak it than 1%.
They sure were
No more puns at least haha
I was about to say that most young people are quite computer literate, but after reading this thread I'm losing confidence lol
Maybe my perspective is just not representative, but in my school every kid in class was doing PowerPoint or Prezi presentations at 12/13 years old
In high school we used to prank teachers by writing short BAT file, putting it on the desktop of the classroom computer and disguising it as the Firefox shortcut, so it does something funny when clicked (shuts down the PC for example)
the ol' switcheroo, mi is ilyenekkel próbálkozotunk
I think it depends on what field you work
I would expect someome working in a office to know those "skills" you mentioned
Someone who works in construction, maybe not
Yeah, all the names that have English equivalents are like this
:D I mean the English equivalent of Miklós is Michael (not pronounced the same) or maybe that was not the question
Idk
I think you mean Miklós = Nicholas, since Michael = Mihály
Yeah, sorry
One of the few places in Europe thats still relatively untouched
the primal, natural feeling there is pretty cool
I mean you can get lost up in the Zemplén.
I'm not sure what you mean by the question
Is he/she born abroad but still a Hungarian citizen at birth because his/her parents are Hungarian
That wouldn't be controversial at all
Is he/she born abroad AND his/her parents aren't Hungarian so he/she is a naturalized citizen
Some right-wing voters would probably be upset, especially if the naturalization process happened later in life
I was always surprises, wow that french man has a really hungarian looking name
Now i see that im just dumb
Its also a bit funny that his name means something along the lines “between mud” by spelling Sárközy
In Hungary [Index] and [444
hu] are the two largest newspapers that are not state run (yet)
To be fair though, it's not like they fear them, our current government can do whatever they want at this point
Even if these papers would report on every single heinous crime they commit all day long (which they tried to do in the past, but they just couldn't keep up) will not change the fact that the current ruling party made it so that they cannot be beaten in a normal fair election
So they're just mildly annoyed by them
Our newspapers fear the government lol
There is one webpage in Hungary, called Átlátszó, and they are trying to make transparent the goverment work, mostly the financial part
Remember that one time when the government set internationally wanted fugitive Nikola Gruevski up with a safehouse that was literally next door to 444
hu's offices
That's how little they care about their wrongdoings being reported in the media
Their voters live in a goverment owned media bubble, they only ever hear how perfect everything is
They don't even put in the work to find scapegoats any more
But yeah he is one of the classics
Mostly
They don't even put in the effort for their propaganda bs
One example from this week
A Führerbefehl was given last week that all the not life-threatened patients have to be sent home from the hospitals, so there will be beds for corona-patients
There are many stories that also those kinds of patients are sent away who need 0-24 medical supervision which isn't expected from untrained relatives who need to work, btw
One of the hospitals didn't do this quickly enough - so the hospital director was fired on the spot
All the doctors and nurses protested for him, everybody said he was a very good director and doctor, it created a huge uproar
The government didn't care
And today, the government media found unmasked the conspiracy: one of the NGOs who protested, is partially financed by Soros
Conclusion told in the media: everybody who says it might not have been the best decision to fire that director, is the slave of Soros
Sometimes, a "war" brings out the good from the people in the meaning of holding together
Unfortunately, the corona crisis has brought out the very worst from Orbán.
Aaaahhh you murdered this joke
More like Russia or Turkey, since we're at least nominally a democracy
Also the freedom of press has only been limited through financial means rather than outright force
At least so far
Not only that, that motherf
has been on an authoritarian luck streak ever since he got into power
He won the elections AFTER the 2008 financial crisis hit
Ever since, he has been riding the uptick of the global economy that he could sell as his and his party's own success
Then the migrant crisis hit, that he could and has been milking for years now
and now this
Every time his approval rating starts to dip significantly a new crisis hits that he can blame on the "Crumbling West" / Migrants / Soros / Brussels / or insert random conspiracy theory
Take your pick
Sometimes it's all of these in one
And since all the media is now owned by him and his crooks, he can put any spin on any story they want
Nothing short of a miracle I'm afraid
The opposition did defeat his party in the mayoral elections last autumn, but the stakes are far higher in a national election, and Orbán has a LOT to lose
He'll do pretty much anything to stay in power
I'm really not sure
Putting maximum political pressure on him and cutting EU funding could work, but it could also help him turn public opinion against the EU
Also, the latter would not happen anyway, as Poland would veto it
Cut EU funds and put pressure on the govenment
I think its fair to say: Poland
It all started when we formed a personalunion( both of us had the same king)
Also as I know we were the only ones helping the polish in the Polish-Soviet War of 1920
Later we refused to attack Poland in 1939 and we didnt let the germans attack from our terrority
The poles inspired our revolution of 1956 and they donated a lot too
In conclusion Poland and Hungary are brothers
With a series of dynastic marriages (Queen Kinga and Jadwiga were from Hungary), and the occasional personal union with either Hungary (Louis and Wladyslaw of Varna) or the Principality of Transylvania (Stefan Báthory)
Medieval Hungary and Poland rarely having any conflicting interests helped a lot, probably
Military assistance was often provided (from coordinated efforts against Mongol incursions to Jan Sobieski, Józef Bem and some well-needed Hungarian supplies for the Polish-Soviet war)
Not only Hungary refused to attack Poland (or even allow Germany access via Hungary) in 1939, but Hungarian troops under German command refused to participate in crushing the Warsaw uprising and provided what assistance they could to Poles (Hungarian uniforms, medical supplies, escape routes for civilians and active fighters, especially from and around district Mokotów)
Poles reciprocated the assistance by donating substantial amounts of blood and medical supplies during the 1956 revolution ([ [
Hungary used to be a safe haven (or a transitory) for Polish émigrés and refugees after the partitions and during WW2), too
It started with them:
It started around 1000, during the reign of the Árpád and Piast dynasties
Here's an article in [Hungarian] and in [Polish] The [English] one is very incomplete
This friendship is more important than a silly world war
It's insane how we know what to do when the occasion rises
I've read about resistance fighters escaping among the Hungarian troops themselves and an alleged single instance of a firefight between Hungarian and German troops
&#x200B;
Too bad that switching sides was not a realistic option, given the horrible circumstances
&#x200B;
Edit: [
A dream team
Ostmark
Polish assistance provided spontaneously for the 1956 revolution is rather chilling
In mere days, supplies worth 2 million dollars were delivered to Hungary
That would amount near 19 million in today's money, from a country devastated by the war eleven years prior
The rallies in Hungary that sparked the revolution were partly motivated by Polish events
Here's a Polish eagle among the banners, accompanied with a call for solidarity with the Polish nation:
Südost-Bayern
Yes, a LOT of people
Thank you, came here to comment that
You were faster
Aside from the usual self-depricating jokes, most of gen z loves to make fun of the very nationalistoc Hungarian attitude
Some people tend to think that everything and everyone important in history can be traced back to Hungary and we are the center of the universe
We, teens find that very funny
We have a phrase: “Sírva vigad a magyar” which meant we are crying even when we have fun
Most pessimistic humor you can imagine .
About 20% gyipsies, 15% politics, 35% Scots, 10% poltics and 20% wife bad
Sarcasm, self-deprecation, and sadly, a lot of antisemitism and racism
Basically just fuck everyone and make fun that they can't say word properly or a Hungarian not understanding other languages
There's a joke about that
Which are the three shortest books
Hungarian military victories after 1490
American culture
The thousand years of German humour
I think in Eastern Europe, we have a great heritage about making up and understanding some quality political jokes, even in the middle of conversation
In socialist era the bittersweet sarcasm and semi-safe puns were quite like a coping mechanism with the system, and it taught us to read between lines and catch deep-hidden meanings
And to be pretty honest, most of our contries' political system are a joke ever since, so there was no point in spoiling these great strength of ours
Or the "Bozgors" being stupid
But let me show you the other way around
In the morning, in the barracks of the Romanian Army, the following dialgoues are heard:
"Adrian
"Yes, sir
"You go with the lorry and bring supplies from the warehouse
"Yes, sir, understood
"Ovidiu
"Yes, sir
"You go to the watchtower, and check the reflectors
"Yes, sir, understood
"Ábel
"Yes, sir
"You go and clean all the lavatories with a toothbrush
"Yes, sir, expected
The political system here is so bad the actual joke party(mkkp) would be the best
I don't know that particular sub, but I do like German humour
I liked Stefan Raab or Freitagnachtnews (long time ago) or even Bullyparade
Well the closest thing we had was the "Öszöd speech" - an speech during the conference for the members of the then governing hungarian socialist party
That got leaked and made the party implode
(sadly there is no youtube video with subtitles, enjoy excerpts on the wiki)
Btw
this speech is in large part to blame whrre we are at today
Its when right wing media and FIDESZ started up on populism, to capitalize on this blunder of epic proportion
And due to success havent stopped since
(Before this FIDESZ used to be "thd intellectuals party", now its conspiracy theorist heaven)
That Romania doesn't exist
Yeaah, Trianon hit hard
If someone from a foreign country makes a post or a video about Hungary, the comment section will be full of Hungarians trying to sell each other boilers (bojler eladó)
BOJLER ELADÓ!
Lake Balaton doesn't exist
The Treaty of Trianon expires this year so we'll get back the Carpathian mountains and Transsylvania
Slovaks are Czechs who speak Hungarian
We are hungry
Bojler eladó
Trianon ends on June 4th this year
Atleast this is what some people keep saying
Don't be a dumbass
SLOVAKIA doesn't exist, Romanians do
But they have hairy soles
(on the second part: fuck me sideways if I know why that became a running gag)
This is bullshit, nobody says that
A "very funny" running joke is to say "I'm older than Slovakia".
oh god oh fuck
Yeah
Romanian's hairy feet is the weirdest piece of racism I've ever seen/heard of
Where do you live
Here in Debrecen it is a very common saying
I have no idea
It’s on know your meme [Here]
But if you take look at the comment section of for example videos about hungarian food, you are gonna run into these comments

" A szőröstalpú meg kifejezetten a románokra aggatott, elvileg a magyarok Kárpát-medencébe történő vándorlása során keletkezett kifejezés. Akkoriban mindenki bőrbocskorban járt a hegyekben, a szőrös felével belül, hogy az melegítse a lábát. A románok viszont a szőrös felével kifelé hordták, mert úgy jobban lehetett haladni a hóban, kevésbé csúszott és süllyedt mélyre benne
Legalábbis ez a fáma, a legenda szerint innen származik az elnevezésük. "

I’m trying to not be interested in my own country’s politics
Sigh
I'm actually more interested in foreign politics
Mostly the UK and Germany, and when it comes to that any country that has a big influence on the EU like France, Italy or the Netherlands
In Hungary it is absolutely normal especially is non-urbanized regions
Very
Basically everyone in secondary school drinks
Literally everyone
Teachers, students from 14 to 18
Alongside smoking both vapes and cigarettes and energy drinks
Fucking lovely in here
Fidesz-KDNP combo, because they are one party at this point
Two Tailed Dog Party, a joke party but it's the real opposition
And the rest, welfare parties, not really doing anything, at all
Which one is the Tsar's party
Absolute dictatorship, disaster, no free speech, opression
wait the mayor of Budapest is liberal, take that back
Thanks, TIL
Not exactly the same, but the closest in my opinion „legyen“ (let it be), it’s usually said when annoyed
Like when your friend wants to go that pub, you want to go to this pub, but you say „I’ll let it be“ instead of arguing about it
Well, pretty much only one, and that isn't really it either
The word is "Legyen", which means like "fine" or "okay", but people rarely use it in this context
I can't think of any other right now
This is very similar to our Hungarian na jó
In Hungarian we have "na jó", and "jó" means good in Hungarian, so we basically say the same
Depending on context, I think "jogos" is the closest to fair enough
Mostly during debates, when one side brings up a good (counter-)argument, "jogos" is used in the same way as fair enough
I’d rather say “hát jó” but it really depends on the intonation
You can either approve something positively or agree with something you would disagree with otherwise
Yeah, "hát jó" ("well, ok") can seem passive-agressive
"Fair enough" is more positive and kind of agreeing
I would say "végülis ja" would have the same sentiment, or "abban is van valami" or "aha, van benne valami".
Or a bit archaically "ám legyen"
Ebben is van valami
Family name + Surname
The exact oposite of every other European country
And our surnames also have to be chosen from a pre determined list, but the list is huge so you can find all names that are not like Elon's Son's name
In Hungary the struckture of the names is different: 1
Name Family name given by the father surname + 2
Name Your given name (Parents have to choose from a list) + 3
Name sometimes a second name (Works like a middle name)
Father's surname + given name (+optional given name)
Edit: others usually ask you if you have two given names which do one you use, and refer to you accordingly
Birth names:
Family name (may be double-barrelled) + at most 2 given names
In this order
Married names:
Men can
* keep their own name
* use a double-barrelled family name
* or take the partner's family name while keeping the given name
Women also have the above options, as well as
* adding the husband's family name + -né to the front of their names
* adding the husband's full name + -né in front of their names
* replacing their family name with husband's family name
* replacing their full name with husband's full name + -né
Here's a Wikipedia article that explains this better:
Hungary is unique in this:
Father's family name + given name + (given name but its optional)
In Hungary we've got our surnames first and then "first" names
It's pretty logical if you think of lists of names in alphabetical order, so you won't have all Abraham's first
Greater group first and then smaller, same applies to addresses in .hu btw
As of quantities some have double surnames, as they get married they take their spouses name as well or some use their mum's maiden name as well, but some have two first names too
I think both phenomena get more popular these days
Given names can only get picked from an officially approved list which very slowly extends over time
I like this sort of conservatism so too funky names don't occur
Isn't family name = surname
I think you were thinking about "given name"
I don't know what most of my ancestors did around 1819
I can trace only one branch of our family tree back that far in the past, on that side pretty much everyone belonged to petty noble families and were landowners in Northeastern Hungary
So I guess I'd be the same with a tiny chance of being a soldier, teacher or working for the local government
My ancestors lived further north, in the border of Borsod and Gömör/Gemer counties (mostly in Slovakia nowadays) so most likely I would be a peasant, or maybe a miner, or a foundryman
I would be a very poor peasant
The freedom of serfs did not come until 1853 in Hungary
Well not "Austro-Hungarian" strictly speaking
The dual monarchy was established in the [1867 compromise]

Fortunately, you can't die twice
This thing is only working when you have born in a rich family
It is of course important to consider the financial consequences it might bear on my country if we were to “upset” China, as losing out on trade completely would not be something my country could afford in my opinion
On the other hand, morally, I would absolutely be in support of us cooperating with Taiwan, even though I am not completely aware of how exactly it could be beneficial to both parties because of my lack of knowledge about the taiwanese industry, but if it were to be of benefit, I would 100% support it
Given of course that even if we lose China as a partner, the alternatives we find are not too bad
Same in Hungary
Same in Hungary
we have Saint Nicholas on the 6th of Dec tho
Seemingly everyone who's been to Budapest, upon finding out you live there, insists on asking if you live in Buda or Pest
I think it's some sort of 'look at me, I learned there's two parts
' but it's about as useful a distinction of asking someone if they're from North or South of the Thames in London
A lot of tourists Say Bukarest in Budapest and probably Budapest in Bukarest
At least know what city you are in
It is not impossible
From Bulgaria
Maybe they hoped for a "yes", because they do eat dogs
Btw, it gives another meaning to the infamous Hungarian war slogan from WW1: "Quit, dog Serbia
" (sorry about that)
>15
That Ireland uses pound sterling
>17
That the toll machines take pound sterling (happens all the fucking time)
That's something I can understand
We had a five-day class trip to Ireland, and we crossed into Northern Ireland for a day
I completely forgot about it and tried to pay in euros, after that in obsolete pound notes
I was in Berlin once, and visited a genuine Italian restaurant late at night (near to the Potsdamer Platz)
The menu, the whole atmosphere very Italian, the waiters themselves looked very Italian, too
So, very authentic
I ate tagliatelle al ragú, and it was heavenly, not like the socalled "bolognese spagetthi".
Anyway, a stereotypical American couple (like both 90 years old, very colourful shirts, baseball caps etc) was sitting at a nearby table
When the waiter was taking their orders, I overheard him answering to their question with a poker face: "No, we don't have pizza with pineapple
" I almost loled
But the Swedes do hate you, though, right
We need more leaders like Atatürk
I don't know how it's abroad, but in Hungary it means "give me your cheapest wine". So this is what I do everywhere, too
My previous bank using Internet Explorer 8 and Windows XP
Floppy disks in 2019
On the other hand Austria created a solar power plant by shutting down a nuclear one and plumping some solar panels on top of it
Pure genius
My dentist has a windows xp pc
Various cities, until spring of 2018, had to use Win 95 based Ddos program with floppy disk in the taxation section
The whole system was a shitshow ( the current isn't better either) data losses because of the negligence from the Kincstár, the program couldn't handle various situations which led to unnecessary bills to the citizens
The new ("""new""") program didn't worked for a year and we were forced to use the old parallel with the new
Every data had to be relocated by hand

My problem is not with outdated technologies but with IE8's security issues
Not exactly a word, but the lack of formal language can be a bit annoying
inte för mycket och inte för lite
There are not many European languages that use honorifics like the Japanese do
There might be none, actually
Sure, but when one translates from another language to English, a lot of nuance can be lost because of this
[Hidegkuti Nándor Stadium

Two concrete walls behind the goalposts
[Nyugati Station overpass in Budapest]
This bridge lost its purpose and they are gonna demolish it fortunately, but I wanted to say an example that is not only ugly, but purposeless, since the buildings people share are just subjectively ugly, since I like a lot of them
That doesn't mean there aren't very ugly buildings here, like [this one] I think my tolerance is higher
I think social realism left well-recognizable landmarks in Eastern European countries, maybe every larger settlement could provide horrible constructions in this thread
My favourite is this community center from my hometown, Nyíregyháza
Hint: it's supposed to look like a bridge
[Before] and [after] renovation
Some think it didn't help at all
I deeply agree with them, it should've been torn down
In my childhood there was a rumour that it made into an "ugliest building in the world" contest, but I couldn't find any source
Anyway, it shows perfectly how locals feel about this monster in the city centre
I worked at McDonalds's. Someone asked for a beer
I was surprised how can somebody ask a beer her, bit I later learned that McDonald's actually sell beer in other countries
ok you won this
in my school religions are only mentioned in history classes and we only learn the basics of a religion and what people actually believe in
I also had religious lessons but I didn't mind
I've always thought that christianity is an important thing in the European culture because of its influence for decades
Having a basic knowledge about christianity and the Bible is the same cultural minimum as about your country's literature and history
Although I can see that its quality deeply depends on the system and the teacher
I've heard stories about how extremely religious teachers tried to turn the students' whole view of the world and force dogmatic moral principles on them (especially Roman Catholic teachers)
I think a few classes don't harm but there should be a regulation to avoid proselytization
I would've loved this in high school
Hell i'd still love it as an online course or something
Religions are fascinating and tell us so much about human nature and history
That being said my religion class was about loving Jesus, singing and not drawing birds on top of churches
it was not compulsory to attend at least
I think I'd choose either Esztergom, or Székesfehérvár.
Historically, these cities are both much more important than Budapest
Székesfehérvár was the centre of the Kingdom at the time of Saint Stephen I, and it was the coronation city
And Esztergom was the centre of the Archbishops of the Kingdom
&#x200B;
I guess some people would also say Debrecen, since it's the 2nd largest city after Budapest, but in my opinion, it's too far East, while Budapest is in the centre/Northern region
And Székesfehérvár and Esztergom are both really close to Budapest
>Overall I support Berlin by today but if I had to choose in 1949 I'd definetely say Frankfurt>Bonn
As far as I know, that's exactly why they chose Bonn
The plan was always reunification with Berlin as the capital, Bonn was always meant to be temporary
Putting the capital in Frankfurt would have been seen as a more permanent solution
I mean they can't even get Budapest right
Remember people, it's Budapesht
Btw Székesfehérvár means Chair White Castle
Stuhlweißenburg in German
Nah, if I had to choose from a former Hungarian city, I'd definitely choose Cluj
That would lead to problems with the hungarians
It's neither of those
It wasn't a capital, and it's not really central to the old borders, it's just my own bias, as I like Transylvania more than Slovakia
And it's the largest city in Transylvania
(And it's kinda central to Transylvania)
True dat
2% only
the amount of EU money FIDESZ makes up all kinds of lies about makes us pretty important but in a bad way, I think, besides, we're about to cross the line to dictatorship if they stay in power in 2022, we either get sanctioned or kicked out of EU if they finally realise
Not the country, only the PM
We've been taken hostage on this ride, and I don't see a way out yet
The election system got distorted, the opposition is flaccid, and the governing party has its tentacles in everything
You as germans should know that something like this is not only possible, it's scarily easy to achieve if the populace is not self-aware, educated and is not fed propaganda instead of real news
I'm not trying to whitewash Hungary, I'm well aware of how problematic we are right now to the EU, but please know that what Orbán does is no way what we think is right, it's byzantian power games and blackmail to get his way
And we live that every day
Under current circumstances, that's not so easy
You see, back when the left was in government, they did a shit job too
So much so, that people went and voted on a protest basis back in 2010
Orbán was nowhere the authoritarian back then as he is today, he appeared as a charismatic and competent figure who could bring order into that shitshow
He had a lot of help from Arthur Finkelstein, and that set his campaign (and his political direction) on a course mwe see today
He won a political majority, and he could basically govern alone without any discussion, which he used to quickly re-write the constitution, the voting process and weaken the rules of the democratic checks and balances so that every decision can, and would be tipped in his favor
We are a cautionary tale for the rest of the world: in a few years, even the strongest democracies can be eroded to the point where we are now
Yes
In my country Healthcare is free but it's shit (interpret free as 18
5% of your income)
My uncle with stroke was literally sent home because they said they can't treat him
Sucks
&#x200B;
But this'll get lost in the sea of comments from Scandinavian people saying it's awesome and everyone should have it and it's a human right and bla bla bla
It's not really free as others have said
A big big downside is that since the government is controlling it, it means that they can decide how much money goes into it
So, if they're not investing into healthcare, you're getting horrible service, unhappy nurses and doctors and patients
Yes, the funding of the health care system is not done well, most of the buildings are old, doctors can't work well in that environment
Just a few months ago the government changed the new contract healthcare workers had to sign, and thousands left because of that (in the middle of a fucking pandemic, so you can guess how generous the new contract was)
bottom text
In addition to not counting the uninsured or people who can't afford treatment, they're often comparing our public healthcare to the US private system
Most - actually I presume all - European countries also have private clinics and hospitals where you can go if you aren't happy with the public system and, of course, if you have enough money
The difference is if you don't have money, you might wait a bit in the public system
Without a public system, you would wait indefinitely
Oh, and lots of doctors and dentists in private clinics also list prices on their website, so you can compare
I think the very existence of a public system helps keep private prices low
Lots of people go to private dentists or specialist doctors for less expensive things, but if it's cancer or something, thank goodness for the public system
I don't understand how the Dutch still have throats

We really appreciate the attempt
Lengyel, magyar, két jó barát.
Did the polish run out of vowels in some point or do you just write like that for shits and giggles
We are aware of the confusion, so we always say our names in a western name order to foreigners
Which can cause double trouble if they know our tradition and call us our first name in a formal setting - it doesn't help that most of our first names of international origin (like Latin, Greek or Hebrew etc
) are almost always spellt a little bit differently
Like John = János or Thomas = Tamás etc
I work abroad
If I got a euro every time they mistake my surname with my first name I would be a millionaire
Also they never know if I'm male or female
I'm talking about emails of course
magyar, köszönöm, szia, jó napot, nem
Hungarian, thank you, hi, good day, no
As far as I know Lengyel comes from Old Russian "Lendo" but I have no idea what it means
We use lines to indicate a long vowel
E is like the first in ever, while é is like the first vowel in cane
A is like in car, while á is like in bye
The whole batch is: á, é, í, ó, ö, ő, ú, ü, ű
> Also they never know if I'm male or female
Yes
This is also very typical
The name Zsolt is variation of Zoltán which can be derived from the Turkish word for sultan (king)

Decolonisation
Although not physically in Europe, I think this counts as European history
I don't know too much about how the colonial powers lost/gave up all their colonies
Hungarian USSR & Romanian invasion of hungary between WWI & WWII - i guess its used to be politically inconvenient (to the narrative of big evil hungary), then completely obscure
I would certainly want to know more about the time between the fall of the Roman Empire and Charlemagne
We haven't really learned about it
Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived
His reign was basically
He struggled to get a male heir, and the reason he separated England from the Catholic church is because he wanted a divorce
He also had a jousting accident later on in life, so he became a fatass
Also, Yugoslav Wars in general
It is at the end of the history books, so usually, there is no time to talk about it in school
The YT channel John D Ruddy has some amazing videos about 20th century Irish history, like the independence war, Bloody Sunday, the civil war, The Troubles, Good Friday Agreement, etc
We are very bad at enjoying ourselves, most of our holidays are just days of mourning
March 15
: Failed revoution
October 23
: Failed revolution + loads of kids dead
Halloween = 'Mindenszentek napja' (All Saints' Day): We go to the cemetery, take care of the graves and mourn
We do celebrate on 20th August (Foundation Day)
Actually on March 15
we celebrate a successful revolution because the revolution was successful
The war of independence failed that followed the revolution and that's way it's a bittersweet celebration
Fair enough
Hungary's anthem says: "Megbűnhődte már e nép a múltat s jövendőt!" = 'They who suffered for all sins of the past and of the future'
Also it talks a lot about the glories of Hungarians just to top it off with how when we fucked something up we got punished for it 10x over
Last verse:
"Pity, God, the Magyar, then,
Long by waves of danger tossed;
Help him by Thy strong hand when
He on grief's sea may be lost
Fate, who for so long did'st frown,
Bring him happy times and ways;
Atoning sorrow hath weighed down
All the sins of all his days
...Very cheerful lyrics
Well Mindenszentek is on November 1st, and Halloween is just non-existant
Thus All Saints' Day is taken a bit more seriously than in other countries
(And because of the closeness of these two dates it's sometimes called a "Hungarian halloween".)
Yeah, fair enough
Now that I think of it even after the war we got more freedom, so I guess that's good
A mighty foe indeed
I didn't even talk about our Szózat (Secondary anthem)
A parts of the official lyrical translation:
"Oh, Magyar, keep immovably
your native country's trust,
for it has borne you, and at death
will consecrate your dust
&#x200B;
"To you, O nations of the world,
we call with passioned breath:
"Should not a thousand years of pain
bring liberty—or death
&#x200B;
"Or there shall come, if come there must,
a death of fortitude;
and round about our graves shall stand
a nation washed in blood
&#x200B;
Around the graves where we shall die
a weeping world will come,
and millions will in pity gaze
upon the martyrs' tomb
Well Happy St
George's day to you too
And I will also look up you guys, because you seem to have an interesting history
: As I was searching up the Szózat english lyrics I remembered this old revolutinary song (similar tone): [Have fun ;)]
On the 24th mostly
We exchange gifts/put them under the tree for the kids at the evening
A lot go to church this day, but my family for example goes on the 25th
24th December
We decorate the tree in the morning and presents are handed in the evening
it differs from family to family
on 24th evening: close family dinner and presents
25th, family on my mother's side, 26th is family on my father's side
then the rest is random people we know, friends and just rest
from hungary
Nem, 23-a nem fontos ünnepnap, kivéve persze ha vasárnapra esik
Amúgy nagyon jól tudsz magyarul, legalábbis ez alapján az egy mondat alapján :D.
Lehet, hogy csak előre felrakták, hogy mit adnak majd Karácsonyra
Ki tudja xd
Várjunk, amúgy te lennél az a francia, akinek mindig látom a kommentjeit r/hungary-n? Haha, nem túl meglepő, hogy ezen a subon is megtalállak
Also the color of shorts is white, its not khaki pants, or jeans
Budapest for sure, it's like there are more tourists every year
Lake Balaton also used to be frequented by foreigners but has become a sort of poor man's beach holiday lately
I think Budapest and the lake Balaton are the most touristy
The Centre of Budapest, and the cities around the Balaton
Lot's of people visit these 2 things in Hungary and call it a day, which is sad, because we have a shitton of castles and ruins scattered all around the North Hungarian mountains
[It’s Lake Balaton]
I just realized that even though I have been to Romania like 6 times, for several days each time, I've never visited anything outside of Transylvania
I've been to Skiathos and the Meteora monasteries
Idk, I was just there and the campsite was full of foreigners, even in the pandemic so they're definitely still there
It was poor man's beach resort for a while, but now it's becoming the private swimming pool of the Orbán family & friends
That's odd to hear, I had friends visit from the UK, and you can get flights from a lot of places, well, maybe not now, but I know people flew here from London, Leeds, Glasgow and Edinburgh
I myself fly to Glasgow and back very frequently too
Well, among the people I know, it kinda is, but it's not like what Mecca is for the Muslims
But when someone does go to Romania, there is a 100% chance they're going to Transylvania, and an additional 99% chance that they go to Székelyföld
I mean I spent the majority of my time in cities like Targu Mureş, Gheorgheni, Sfântu Gheorghe, Odorheiu Secuiesc etc
you know it
But even I don't know why I don't try out other places, I've heard lots of things about Bucharest, Constanţa etc
Also, when we go to these cities, we never say "We go to Romania", but it's an unwritten rule that we must say "We go to Transylvania
" :'D
Will do if/when this corona stuff ends
I would say east of budapest since budapest gets recommended a lot and is east of czechia
>I wonder, does the Transylvanian Hungarian dialect differ much from the Hungarian spoken in Hungary
Are there any linguistic differences
There are some words that are unique to them, and they have a what we in Hungarian call "tájszólás", which is a kind of an accent/dialect
But it's a rather mild difference between the 2, so with some extra effort, you can understand them
The same goes for Southern Slovakian Hungarians, although the difference is even smaller there
I don't know anything about the Vojvodinan dialect, because I have never met anyone from there, but I think it's the same thing with their words
That's the thing in Hungarian, differences in the language usually come through in the different regional words, rather then pronunciation
I'm not saying that there aren't any differences in pronunciation, because there are, the most famous one being the Szeged dialect (instead of Es, they say Ös), but it's mainly the words
E.g. I live in the North East, and we have some words that are uniquely North-Eastern;
Wheelbarrow - Talicska, but we say Furik
Sunflower seeds: - Szotyi, but we say Makuka
Hood (like on the hoodies) - Kapucni (of Slavic origin), but we say Süsü
Fun fact: Süsü is also a well known Hungarian children's tale
"Süsü a sárkány" (Süsü the dragon)
>b) visiting areas that have a significant percentage of Hungarian speakers probably feels a lot closer to home than visiting, say, Bucharest
Yeah, that's definitely true, it was a really good feeling to be able go completely get by with my native language in another country, because obviously as a Hungarian that's not something I experience every day
If you mention the name of a state most people will likely know that it's "somewhere in the US" because they heard the name in a movie before
But being able to list all states, letalone point them out on a map
Maybe one in a million
*Maybe* they'll know where California, Florida, and Texas are but that's it
Rest are complete mystery
Ofc, even my grandma knows Florida is the biggest city in California
Well most people recognize state names, i wouldnt say that qualifies as fairly well
r/askanamerican
(Ofc
You can find the equivalent of "what in tarnation of cousin fuckin alabama shit is this
" places of poverty and general misery, and people there wont have much clue - but the same people wont have much clue about a lot of other things either, including current president, form of state - no we dont live in communism, since 3 decades ...etc)
Well, I could name the more famous states on a blind map, but I'm having troubles with their capitals though
I know that it's usually not the most well known city, so it's confusing
What I do know, is that Phoenix is the capital of Arizona, and Tallahassee is Florida's.
On a map, I could locate California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida, Utah, Nevada, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Wisconsin Michigan, Indiana and Minnesota
I can name about 60-70% of them, maybe even roughly put them on the map and talk about it a bit I guess but thats about it
You give too much credit to the average bloke
As the average includes senile old farts who believe aggricukturee is most efficient when done by hand and isnt mechanized, and that we need back franco to bring back virtue in the country and reform the decadent yiuth
...though the capital thjng is skmewhat reasonable, since there are no shortage of places with the "biggest city cant be the capital, that would be opression" similar to asustrakia, all of which ended uphaving a  relatively insignificant place for capital
Florida man is world famous
(yes, thats asignificant part of the reason)
I would say most people would recognize that "its a place in the US" if they hear the name, they could only show it on the map, know some trivia about, or name it off the top of head for relatively few states
Well there are two types of where areyou from
(sadly it delends on context)
...one is inquiring about the location you originate froom
...the other is intrested only in what cultural background do you have - and the US has a lot in common
Imo thats a bit different but I kinda feel like especially here on reddit that everyone just assumes you are American, hence the no shit part
Well germany is prettymuch the only true federal state in europe - that was created by union of places that had som estatehood beforehand
Nope Italy, you were such a political clustrefuck, with borders migrating on a weekly basis that wedeny you your right to call yourself federal
Ok i simply wanted to ilkustrated idiocy, with my countrys most politically powerful brand of idiot - the old fart that idolizes the interwar period, and wants to bring it back
I am pretty cobfident that the existence of morons who dont have much connection to reality is not a phenomenon unique to my country
&#x200B;
People are people everywhere
It sucks MORE than minneapolis
Just reading the wikipedia entry on minneapolis police department makes me wanna avoid the place - and not everything made it to wiki, just high profile stuff with convictions - so the PD effectively running a drug distribution operation wont be on the wiki, nor the fac that main witness mysteriously suicided himself in the day before he was to testify
...does the other city 1 up minneapolis really
What is a phrase in your language which has a completely different meaning when you change the word order
In Hungarian, there's a funny one:
Neked áll feljebb = you are more upset
Neked feljebb áll = your boner is bigger
I unfortunately made this mistake while arguing with my father and we both bursted in uncontrollable laughter
Literally any phrase
Yeah, comas are a pretty big deal
Hungarian
It has random weird grammatical rules
It's fun
We're the people no one invited but we joined anyways
Maybe you're thinking about the Samoyedic languages, which (if my memory serves me right) is a branch of the Uralic languages, just like Finno-Ugric is
Yeah, travelling's easier
It's literally keep us alive, although the f-in government steals a butt ton of money
Hell yeah dude
Yes
No shitty healthare costs only shitty healthcare
Hell yes, i think i am very lucky to be an eu citizen
It is give us lots of rights and possibilities and compared to other countries in the world it is safe to live here also
György Soros is literally conspiring against the sacred government
Why
Because he's evil
And millions of people actually believe this
EDIT: but you have to see, he doesn't just care about the big picture, according to the government, he's micromanaging the conspiration
For example, the newest issue that he _personally_ persuaded Romani people in a very poor village that they should sue the local government because of school segregation
Now that they have won the lawsuit, the government launched an anti-Romani campaign against them telling that the only reason they sued is because György Soros persuaded them so the Hungarian Government could be criticized
We have flat earthers, but seriously, they're presenting in our schools and doing 'serious' research
Isn’t there a movie about this cult
> To add, the people that say that the current German state is a lie and that Germany still actually operates under the constitution of the Weimar republic/German empire
Why not the DDR
It would be so much fun, like in Goodbye, Lenin
An interview with Székely Sándor:
One could say that during the reunification of Germany the Bundesrepublik didn't absorbe the Demokratische Republik, but umgekehrt
Like Sigmund Jähn and the West-German refugees
I'm just joking around, as if the DDR was a real desirable country to still live in (in spite of the Ostalgie)
Not German, but my grandfather did fight during WW2
He was a warrant officer
He was trained for anti aircraft guns, but he was assigned for anti aircraft machine gun
Of course he was drafted, he had graduated as a jurist and had just began to work at the department of finance
He came from an old, noble family with a long history of intellectuals, of course even when they weren't socialists, they very much disliked the Nazis and the Hungarian Arrow Cross party
He was 23 years old in 1939
He was a very sophisticated, soft voiced and kind person
He died in 2007
He was assigned at the battle at the Don river
It was the part of the battle for Stalingrad
It is infamous that the Germans used the poorly prepared and supplied Hungarian troops as a living shield when the Soviets began a counterattack: 130
000 soldiers perished or disappeared there
The Soviets were the enemy, but the Germans didn't behave a lot better towards the Hungarians
They did shoot down airplanes: mostly I-16 "Rata" planes
I remember he wrote letters to home on the fabric of the parachutes
It was a very cold winter and they had to flee back once the counterattack started
The whole Hungarian army collapsed
They had to walk 300 km back to the Axis lines in -30°C. And then Gusztáv Jány, the commanding officer of the army, assigned a proclamation that the Hungarian Army had lost its honor
He was hung in 1946 for war crimes
My grandpa told a lots of things
For example that they were also frightend by the sound of the Stuka dive bombers even when those were on their side and they weren't the targets
Or that the driver of a truck was shot down while he was sitting next to him: the bullet came from the side, only a few centimeters over his legs
Or that the bunkers were filled with mice like a carpet
Then he came home, but was later reassigned to the West, and then taken as a POW
Fortunately, not by the Soviets but by the Americans, so it wasn't that bad, and it lasted less than a year
He told that the Americans gave lots of goods and supplies to the POWs, but most of those were stolen the "guards" who were assigned from among themselves
EDIT:
he had married my grandmother only months before the battle for Stalingrad
They bought a flat in Buda (which we still have) where my 24 years old grandmother had to bear the Siege of Budapest (undeservedly unknown city battle of WW2, it was one of the worst sieges) alone in their flat in 1944 (while my grandpa was POW)
They both wrote a journal about these times
i always use english wikipedia, but hungarian wikipedia is surprisingly good
There is a lot of content on it
Hungarian Wikipédia is suprisingly extensive, although the quality of the articles are often questionable, expecially the ones about the hungarian languges history, and pre-christianity history
Crap, it's sometimes better in hungarian subjects, but most of the time english is just superior even in articles about hungary
Hungarian wiki is not too bad, but my personal preference is always the English wiki
The only exception is some very Hungarian specific topics
It's perfectly normal, we even offer it to guests
Some people use filters but it isn't really necessary for health reasons
That said, there are some really old buildings in Budapest where the lead in the old pipes is an issue
If you live in those buildings it's better to buy bottled water
in Hungary  it's definitely safe and in some regions tap water usually has a better taste than bottled water from anywhere (yes, mineral water doesn't really have a taste but in some of our mountains water has a fresh texture)
Yup
Totally normal
I drink tap water everywhere
At home, at school, restaurants
We have very good quality water
I'll have to note, that (in some parts of Budapest) during peak summer tap water is often quite chlorinated, some people do prefer bottled water during those times
Some regions have naturally disgusting water
Excellent as thermal water for baths, but still kind of (sometimes really) unhealthy
If you float quality mineral water through the pipes for decades, some of those minerals will settle out on the walls and recreate your "contamination". It can be avoided, if you remove all soluble materials, or use distilled water
Try it just once
(and donkey drink much as it's not exactly healthy)
I can assure you that it utterly lacks taste and has a fast flowing oil-like (WD40) like texture to it
>  the only thing exotic about it is the price
exactly, that's why people buy it
that way you can show that you are so well of that you can afford to buy (tap) water for such an exotic price
btw people tend to just buy one and refill the bottle
The government just made the Samsung factory in my town a special economic area, meaning the tax from it (which amounted to 1/3 of the town's budget) now goes to the government controlled county council, instead of the opposition controlled town council
Oh and to top it all off, the insanely corrupt government says it's because the opposition are corrupt
Is it really Airbnb though, instead of domestic and foreign real estate investors in general
Barcelona's metropolitan area has a bigger population than Ireland's and they are in the forefront of fighting Airbnb, and according to their own estimates, the number of units in such use is a little under 20 thousand
And as nice as your country is, I'm sure tourism is a fraction of Barcelona's.
Met one English guy here on a stag party in Budapest, but we had an awesome chat over a few cigs, great experience all around
Oh, the usual
A lot of people hate it, some people love it, but most just don't care all that much, I'm afraid
In Budapest the negative stereotype doesnt seccessarily come from being british, its the obnoxious pubcrawl drunkness is the bad part
Never heard anyone complain about british tourist for any other reason
Also its not just you guys, the germans do it too
Yeah, a lot of people don't realise that what the government does isn't just in the news, they will feel it on their own skin as well
Hopefully this whole crisis will change that a bit, but I wouldn't bet on it
Pretty sure I've heard of all of them
Not sure about Catania though
ughh the amount of time we mentioned it in spanish class
im getting ptsd any time i see the name xd
Maybe with German names
* Iași = Jassenmarkt
* Bydgoszcz = Bromberg
* Timișoara = Temeswar
* Cluj-Napoca = Klausenburg
* Constanța = Konstanz(a)
* Craiova = Krajowa
* Galați = Galatz
Learn the vowels first, it's really important
We have 14 of them (a, á, e, é, i, í, o, ó, ö, ő, u, ú, ü, ű)
Think that you learn an alien language
It's going to be easier then
Every rule has an exception and a 'backdoor way of saying'.
Don't be surprised if finding yourself considering giving it up
Don't even try
And then give it up because its hard AF
Alternative:
Buy textbook
Open textbook
Assume fetal position and cry for approximately 2,5 hours
Reevaluate your life choices
(Or maybe I just suck at grammar)
Of course languages go through some kind of "economisation" over time, but if something is working perfecly fine I don't see the point why get rid of it
Hungarian has 18 cases
English has a trillion phrasal verb which is a pain in the ass to learn all of it
As for exeptions, look up the japanese verb conjugation, it's just so simple and beautiful, they have three groups of verbs and almost no exeptions
We have 44 letters
There are just too many and high school me couldn't handle them
Sometimes they just seemed so unlogical
For example when "a plane takes off", why is it off
Why not up
It's going upward so for me the logical one would be up, but no, let's give it a twist and make it off, lol
But honestly, I've got a terrible english teacher in high school so maybe because I hated her my relationship with the english language is not that smooth that I'd like it to be
Well, yeah
History
The European identity first and foremost is based on shared history
Yes, that pleases my ego
I think this is the best answer
Look at Asian countries - they don't even have Latin words in their languages that we take for granted and is a commonality between us Europeans, their culture is so different
Of course, Europeans exported their languages to other parts of the world, so that's not necessarily the best comparison, but it definitely originated from here, and there are other differences between Argentinan and European people (where they speak Spanish) for example that are noteworthy too and more obvious
Not to mention other "groups" like Muslims, Africans, Indians, etc
I guess America is hard to tell, but I think you can by a few things
- but they are also just far from us
Plus they don't take their Greek and Latin  origins that seriously
Maybe if you count the ancient ceremonial buildings of native Americans, too, because 400-500 years old churches don't count as old as fuck in Europe at all
Even we have churches from after 1000 AD
Yeah, I was just referring to the culture, not the language itself
It's just in certain schools where you have to learn Latin
Sorry for the confusion
I would watch that show
If you cry - "Don't soak the mouses"
If you yawn - "Are you waiting for the fried dove to fly into your mouth
If you don't eat the carrot - "You won't be able to whistle" or "It has A vitamin in it, you'll have a better sight from it"
If you watch TV for too long - "Your eyes will pop out"
If you pick your nose - "Do you have a mining permit
Mine also said stuff like "Your mouth is as large as the Viennese gate" when I was too loud, "It doesn't close with a zip tie" when I left a door open, "Your stomach will go cold" when I talked too much and that's all I can think of right now
In Hungarian like every word is written how it's spelled
same here
Edit: ok there are 3 exceptions:
Tradition: if you have a stupid noble name like Széchenyi or Batthyány
That´s a totally different pronounciation, you don´t wanna know
Grammar: for example by conjugating some verbs: higyje is pronounced higgye
Or compounds: bab+püré, babpüré is pronounced bappüré (becomes voiceless)
Simplifying: for example digraphs that are pronounced long are not written doubled but simplified: Mennyi and not menynyi
Also the j and ly
They used to be different sounds but they are pronounced the same now, however the writing never changed
\#2 is actually spelled wrong
To make things more interesting (sing
indicative to imperative):
hagy+j = hagyj
hisz+j = higgy
&#x200B;
Phonemicity is occasionally broken by assimilation in pronunciation, too (eg
'szabadság', 'mindnyájunk', 'különbség' etc
This occurs regardless of compositicity (is that a word I just made up
oh shit I spelled it wrong you´re right
Just like an English s in sun
Árnyékszék- shadow chair, it sounds dumb tho
My dad always called it "Fajansz", simply because the particular ceramics from which toilet bowls are made, are called Fayans
The place where even the King has to walk to
Edit: I didn't see OP also wrote the same in their post (probably we just translated it differently)
The place of decency (illemhelyiség)
Te tetted e tettetett tettet te te tettetett tettek tettese te
Feels like the Hungarian: Répa retek mogyoró korán reggel ritkán rikkant a rigó
In hungary we call them:
Haver,span-mate
Csajszi,csajos-girl
Tesó,tesa- brother
Here in folklore there is plenty of stuff about mongolian invasian (known here as tatars . often with the attribute d "dog-headed"), and fights with a stereotypcially fat turkish ruler
I have no clue if the stories about the times of hungarians raiding/adventuring in western europe are authentic, or late recreateions
If they are the former, then we have plenty, if the latter then we have nothing
An interesting one:
Hungarian tales usually beginn with this: "Egyszer volt, hol nem volt, az óperenciás tengeren is túl, ott ahol a kurta farku malac túr..."
It translates to: "Once upon a time, beyond the sea of Operencia, where the short tailed pig grunts
The magical land of Operencia is actually Upper Austria and Germany
Upper Austria was called "Austria \*ob der Enns\*" (Austria over the Enns River), but why did hungarian folk tales picked on that
No one knows
For a short period of time the Enns was the border between Hungary and the HRE, and the returning mercanaries told fantastic stories about the pillaging in Germany
Maybe imigrants told their german folktales to their kids and refered to their land of origin (many german tales have a hungarian version)
The sad reality: King Matthias was buried in the Basilique of Székesfehérvár next to his "collagues" I Louise the Great, I Charles and Saint Stephen and around ten other kings
When the turks captured the city the basilique was destroyed and the tombs of the kings were looted
(hehe Tomb raiders) The bones found under the ruins are in several steel boxes in a nerby cript, but we are not sure who are in those boxes
The only untouched tomb was III Béla the Great's or Colomon the Book-lover's.
Apprently this is the offical (or one of the offical) translations :D
I prefer Colomon the Learned
Donar returned to Germany, this time as a turkish dish
20 August, the date our first king, Stephen I, was declared a saint
Today, the day is seen as the Foundation Day of Hungary
The 20 August fireworks are probably more important here than the New Year ones (probably because we sing the anthem at that time instead of playing with fireworks
For those who have no idea who he is: [
I would say Trianon but it was more depressing than ridiculous lol
Hungary also had a king who drowned in a river, however, it was not during the crusades but during one of the most decisive battles in Hungarian history
It resulted in 150 years of Ottoman occupation
I'm not from Moldova but not many people realise that Ukraine is more to the north, east, south, and west then Moldova is
"Budapest" :D You mean in Buda
Budapest was created in 1873
I have never been in Russia, but I also do this
I bet Hungary has the highest number of _destroyed_ castles
Looking at you, Habsburgs
We don't have them
Atleast it's not mandatory and only for older "kids" like 17-20 I believe
It might be wrong
There's this thing called Aquincum, I haven't been there for years but as I remember it's kinda big
Yes, there is one in Budapest (Aquincum) and the cities of Szombathely and Pécs were also ancient Roman cities
(Savaria and Sopianae respectively)
Van egy régi mániám -I have an old mania
It's about invading Romania, and getting back Transylvania, using brutality
I don't nesessary agree with the lyrics, but it has a great tone
This song is using well-known rhythms for Hungarians as a montage, combined with beat box, and funny lyrics which also combine well-known verses
The result is this, a funny music video, with funny lyrics
I like degenerate things like the band Belga, but they are pretty well-known and respected, while this is more on the underground side afaik
I could be wrong
In my opinion this is the peak Hungarian humour, but please don't judge me
I can't translate lyrics, would be too hard to get most meaning accurately, but believeme
Best
Song
Ever
I didn't know, and that's interesting
I always thought it was Russian or Ukrainian
I just listened to a conversation the other day about nowadays' nationalism in Hungary and one of the guys had a good point that answers your question as well:
In Hungary one point, we all (most of us) seem to agree upon, is our language - although it's awkward for other Europeans and pretty much useless because it isolates us, but for some reason we love our language
Another interesting one is that we all (most of us) sing our national anthem on New Year's Eve standing and regardless of religion or religiousness at all, start it by singing "God bless the Hungarian" which gets even more awkward if you consider that it was all the same in communism when religion was rather oppressed
Here it might be controversial, but Orbán's hard stance against illegal immigration is something, that almost everyone in the country supports
Oohh what about  New Kids Turbo
Me and my friends loved it
Strawberries  with a straw - what
It's a cynical political tool that offers a solution to a non-existent problem as barely anyone wants to come here anyway; our real problem is emigration, not immigration
Nobody supports illegal actions
But I know you know that Orbán intentionally interfused refugees of war, economic migrants, legal immigration and illegal border-trespassers
If you say that "as a developed country, maybe we had the opportunity to accept a quota of registered, proven refugees to ease other countries", their propaganda and braindwashed zombies will answer "SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT MUSLIMS SHOULD CROSS OUR HOLY BORDER ILLEGALLY AND UNCHECKED TO RAPE OUR WOMEN AND STEAL OUR JOBS
Okay I need to try the chocolate one
Well, at least you get to talk to Hungarians who are usually the opposite
Yeah, the propaganda surrounding the matters is obviously divisive, I'm just merely talking about the "fence" itself
Also, Belgian waffles best waffles, probably
Oh half of my family lives there
(In Hilden, exactly)
And do you eat like this
or is it just decoration
Very poor choice of words
Oooooh that's some delicious stuff, I love it
Yes, and he was black
Most hungarians are not black, but his father was from Africa
I either missed the /s or you have not been in the inner city recently
One of the tesco delivery guys who delivery my stuff is black (I'm careful with the afro-american because this is not america, sry)
No, because the package is either delivered and signed off personally, or (more likely) you get a green notice that you weren't found at home, even if you literally spend 24 hours at home
If the package disappears, that 100% happens while it's being delivered
Here it’s has to be signed by somebody from the house or dropped of to neighbors/post office
But my package was stolen by the post service itself . They will say it was delivered even if it has a tracker
never happened to me fortunately
Yall never heard of Komló and it shows
Necarsulm is pretty ugly, too
An autobahn-junction, the Audi-plant, the headquarters of Lidl/Kaufland and that big ass power plant
They at least pay a lot of taxes to the city making it on of the richest in Germany
And a decent football team(?)
Guys we can't miss Ecser and every other similar little city/village
Who wouldve thought right
Is your country part of the Erasmus program
Because if so, you'll have an option to attend an Erasmus scholarship and if your petition gets accepted, than you can go to any high-education school freely
I believe Hungary is a quite nice choice
It isn't that far from the west, and you can still get great education here while living quite cheaply
u/kingofkonfiguration I ask both of you:
do I have to live in Denmark at least 3 years to get it, or is there any other requirements
(for an EU citizen)
Alcohol in pubs
In smaller, less frequented pubs 10 euros gets you two beers, two wines, 4 spirits and a packet of peanuts
Booze
Hence we host all your stag parties, where you barf and piss on our streets
Fake EU citizenship
Alcohol, probably the cheapest
(erasmus experiences, everyone said that booze is really cheap here)
It's getting more expensive though
A few years ago you could buy a pint of decent beer for less than a Euro, even in Budapest
LOL, I pay 5,59 eur for 3+2 GB data (+2GB because of "youth option" - anyone under 25 can apply for it for free)
Still not as good as 100 gb for 6 euros in Romania
aren't we all
Really on the contrary, m8
Yes, very much
And we just had a surprise thunderstorm yesterday
Hungary's thunderstorm season lasts from late April to early September, although we expirence storms in winter sometimes, but usually that means that the Cb produces one lightning or two
But yesterday it was totally a summer-style squall line with many lightnings and pouring rain
It was caused by the low Ciara/Sabine
We also have some tornados
Like a more significant one (= EF1 or EF2) every 2-3 year, so not very often
But non-tornadic supercells happen pretty often; the geography of Central Europe however isn't in favour of producing similar synoptic patterns like on the Plains in the US
I do
Especially in summer
I don't even like light raining or snow
Fuck that wet bullshit

Yup, didn't want to bring too much grammar in it, just mirror translate as the post said, though adding "to" after(Hungarian grammar)/before(English grammar) "where" is a good idea
Btw, the logic is if you completely ignore agglutination, translation would just sound like English in Yoda style

One of them is head of government, the other is head of state
Chancellor is a German thing
They like to call the head of government that way
I think maybe Austria too
So Merkel is a Chancellor, or with a much sexier word, Bundeskanzlerin, and is not called the “prime minister”.
Presidents and prime ministers are not equally important, in different countries one has more authority than the other, the other being more like a figurehead
Macron and Putin are presidents of their country, and I don’t even know their prime ministers
Boris Johnson is prime minister of the UK (but everybody knows the head of state of the UK, Queen Elizabeth)
We were occupied for 45 years after that, so no, not really
It's set in December 1944, weeks before the Siege of Budapest
Four men have been friends for years, and they go to the pub of one of them every evening, and they talk
About everyday things, how to cook meat properly, what kind of cigarette the pub owner was able to get (during the war), but also theoretical questions of morality; if you can choose, do you choose the fate of an innocent but tortured slave or that of a cruel and evil, but unharmed (and oblivious to his crimes) king
But very soon the theory becomes practice, and they have to choose
*A tanú* - it's one of the greatest movies ever
A Tanú, Best Hungarian movie ever
Full of puns tho
You should check out Eternal Winter (Örök Tél) it's a great historical movie about the soviet era, it won an Emmy award
Kontroll is also a great one
Agreed
Berlin
I feel ya buddy :'(
We are already busy with Transylvania though
It's cool that your country is led by a dragon
Trade with us
:-)
Orban effectively destroyed our country for decades to come only to feed his ego and pockets
He is very talented, I give him that and could have been a formidable leader but he just become a toxic crook and a sorry copy of Putin
Even if we get rid of him (which is nigh-impossible now as he controls EV-UH-RYTHING) the public division and the moral decline will have an effect for the foreseeable future
If he wins again, my family will leave the country for sure
You can take him now, free of charge
Her uncle - the former king - was a nazi
in our mythology/fairytales dragons do tend to have 3 or 7 heads
Can you please stop this shit about immigration
Sure, it's all fine and dandy that he defended Hungary from immigration but what he's doing to Hungary is just sad and infuriating
I really hate when people glorify him, just because they know 1 aspect of his ideologies
> Crime vastly increased
The fact that almost nobody can understand it outside of Hungary
We can create words in soooo many possible way
There are tons of way to make a sentence
I speak English and German (and learning Spanish), and I haven't experienced the same
German words can be long, but that's just "adding words to another".
Hungarian language is very creative
No genders, neither the nouns nor the pronouns
Probably Hungarian would be the perfect language for the crazy American SJWs
We literally say peoplekind
It's just correct that way
We only have 3 tenses more like 2 and a half
Only past, present and future, but it's possible to avoid future in most of the conversations, because present usually applies too
Also sometimes Hungarians use present when It should be the past
It's not interchangable like furure but kinda frequently, usually when you tell a story
Various phonetics
We supposed to be pronunciation geniuses because Hungarian contains almost all the sounds of other languages, except the R in French and German and a few less prominent others
Despite this, Hungarians are usually miserable at pronouncing foreign words, We could probably spot the Hungarian from a thousand non native English speakers
The sounds are correct but the intonation is usually horrendous, the outcome is just butchering English
Endless, variable cuss words, and swearing without any cuss words
There's a million ways to tell somebody to fuck off
My personal favorite is 'Anyád szülne sünt
Or if the person who pissed you off is a cocky biologist you can tell them 'Anyád szülne kifejlett sünt
It means 'I hope your mother gives birth to hedgehogs
We were taught to give whole sentences as an answer to questions in English classes, however Hungarian has a different approach
It allows us to create a positive answer only using a suffix (that we use as prefix)
-Kivitted a szemetet
(Have you taken the trash out
-Ki
(Out)
Hungarians in Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and Serbia:
*Am I a joke to you
it's kind of a double edged sword because we can't spread our beautiful language
Can you understand this
"A rákos kurva anyádat basszad meg te gecisfaszú"
Oh yeah i mean 2 days later i'll be correct
(Jk don't take it seriously i don't want to be killed by everyone bc of this comment)
Kurw/va is the glu what holds together our friendship
Idk i think hungarian is a quite useless language for forgeiners, everyone who want to have some kind of advantages in life should learn spanish, french, german or italian after english
Hungarian is only for those few who just want to speak a non widely spoken language
Ahw yeah that's one of my favourite things about italian
I feel soo nice when i read a sentence with an unknown word and i can (almost) pronounce it correctly
>Oh yeah i mean 2 days later i'll be correct
***ANGRY ROMANIAN NOISES***
Edit: yay Trianon expires /s
psst don't tell them our secret plan
Eh, I don't think that's true, any language is useful as long as there are businesses in that country, you can find a company that looks for its speakers because everything is international nowadays
Sweden also has a population of 10mil, and you can see people learning it because it's easy
I'm not sure i think hungarian is not as useful as other languages and really hard to learn so if i hadn't been hungarian i'd have learned other languages first
Cause they live in Hungary
It's very hard to measure a language's usefulness
The thing is that since those languages you mentioned are really very popular, there is a big competition for them since everyone wants to speak them, so their value is elsewhere, not in the number of speakers
:) Imagine someone speaking 2 Center/Eastern European languages like Polish/Russian and Hungarian, and you will see that there is demand for them
It's just an option, but it might be worth it to think about
> really hard to learn
this is what I'm saying, people don't want to learn it since it's hard
Same goes for Russian and Polish
Yeah but it's the same as the german companies coming to Hungary
They don't learn the language and it's easier for everybody to just speak german
Yeah there must be some kind of advantage by speaking hungarian but it's rare imo for a forgeiner to learn hungarian and master it to a conversational level, therefor companies tend to require hungarians to learn their language
Then they are Hungarian gypsies
Emberek angolul beszélnek többnyire a cégekben
Nekik a szaktudás kell, ha idejönnek, és a németek közül mindenki beszél angolul, aki idejon
Hát igen erről beszélek, hogy a magyar nyelv megtanulása egy külföldinek annyira körülményes sztem, hogy egyszerűbb egy másikat használni helyette
Ja, de szerintem aki megtanul egy harmadik, negyedik nyelvet, az már más módon szeretné kamatoztatni, mint ilyen céges környezetben
Probably sausages
It's tasty, but it's basically the insides of a pig being put inside its guts
Btw there are so many I can't even count it
Pacal, which is a stew made of cattle stomach (at least two kind afaik), and it's great
The whole process of disznóvágás: the whole family comes together to slaughter a pig, with copious amounts of alcohol consumed
All parts are used,  a traditional dish on that day is baked blood with onion, which is exactly what the name says
It looks and tastes like liver, just flatter
Kakastöke pörkölt maybe: it literally means rooster's balls stew, and that's what it is
edit: a word was missing
Yea
it has it's hungarian version, oké, it's basically okay without the y sound
OK is quite frequently used
However, okay is not used, we prefer the Hungarian variant oké (pronounced nearly the same)
Although I would prefer if we would use "rendben" instead
It's very common
We even changed the writing of the word to fit the hungarian pronunciation
From "okay" to "oké".
I wouldn’t really say we use the English word ok but we do say oké in Hungarian which means the same thing
We use oké, ok or okés depending on your mood and who you speak to
Some people also use "okés".
it's spelled the same in Hungarian
and people tend to use it interchangeably with the 'ok' form
I also say okaj, okka and oksi too
I don't think it's common per se, but I think it's more up to one's personal taste
Somehow it feels like "rendicsek" would be more common, as a playful substitution for "rendben".
Two thirds of it are gone, but if he waits another year he will see it anyway
We will then have a long and unfruitful conversation about whether the allied forces drew the borders this badly in the region on purpose, or they simply weren't using their brains
The Sebrian-Croatian-Slovenian Kingdom sure sounds like the name of a country that will stay unified without any ethnic strife for centuries to come
Oh, and the nazis will blow up the Chainbridge
It's all downhill mate
Surprise mechanics
Oh well the world wars really didn’t work out for us, yeah…
Come to think of it I just assumed citizens of the successor states of the Serb-Croat-Slovenian Kingdom think that it was bad that they were chucked together
I have no idea how much power you guys had over the whole map-drawing, I assumed none or close to none
My comment isn't meant as a callout for Serbia & crew, I think you had just as much if not more suffering as a result of the Versailles peace dictatum
Now that I'm thinking about it I am very interested in your take on it if you feel like sharing your opinion
I read the wikipedia page, and from that perspective it could have seemed to be something that might work out, it just didn't.
I think Versailles was a good chance to make sure that wherever serbs liva, that's Serbia, where romanians live, that's Romania, where hungarians live, that's Hungary, etc
, and so there would have been a lot less war and hate and bitterness
The solution not based on nation states ended in tragedy
And while I'm sure some did identify as yugoslav, I'm also sure a whole lot of others thought of themselves as slovenes and so on, so saying that Yugoslavia was a nation state is kind of a stretch
I think everyone knows Poland existed in 1939
"Ág" in Baranya county
"Bő" and "Sé" in Vas county
"Őr" in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county
Ther is also "Ács" and "Öcs" are three characters little ng, but officaly they are two letter long, because "cs" is one letter
/Translations/:
Ács- Carpenter
Öcs- probably comes from the name of the original holders of the land
First form: Ech
Bő- archaic word for rich, today means loose (loose like clothes)
Ág- branch
Őr- guard
Sé- archaic word for Creek
Yes, it is, together with the Dutch town of Ee, which is the shortest-named place in the Netherlands
As a French speaker, I can understand quite a bit from Spanish texts or the very least guess what is it about
On the other hand, I cannot understand spoken Spanish at all
I speak Hungarian, English and German and I understood almost every word
Pronouns etc
can be easily guessed from context, and the words are very similar to their counterparts in English
I got the battle of midway
I could make out about 50% of the words and I got the context
But true, it's really weird
And I guess I could only understand most of it because I know the topic

It isn't strange or unnecessary at all
The _Lord of the Rings_ was translated into Hungarian by Árpád Göncz who later (in 1990) became the first president of Republic of Hungary, and was one of the most beloved politicians of the post-1990 times
He did a very great and good effort to translate these kind of names from the novel into Hungarian, also to make it sound like in a tale
All the later movies used his translations
Baggins is "Zsákos" in Hungarian, meaning the same
Also, Harry Potter was translated (by another person) so that those characters who have generic English names (like HP himself or Ron Weasley etc) kept their names, but those who had a meaning were translated
Even places, objects, for example even Hogwarts is called "Roxfort" in Hungarian because the translator thought Hogwarts is more difficult to pronounce in Hungarian, doesn't sound good, and it's a good wordplay creating a name from "Oxford" (like a place of higher education) and the cheese Roquefort
I read an interview with the translator a long time ago, he explained very detailed why he all these did
In Hungarian, Baggins was translated as "Zsákos" ('one posessing/carrying a sack')
(Also if I might add, I don't know anything about the language, but I just really love the sound of Torbar
The translations of Harry Potter have much more examples of this
For starts, Hogwarts is called 'Roxfort', many of the names are changed (most notably, Snapes becomes Perselus Piton) and the house names are also translated (Gryffindor - Griffendél, Slytherin - Mardekár, Ravenclaw - Hollóhát, Hufflepuff - Hugrabug)
Having grown up on these I don't necessarily find these strange nor unnecessary;  especially since it is targeted towards a younger audience, these translations make the text easier to read, as names like Roxfort or Mardekár roll off the tongue much more easily than the original English names
The titles for the Star Wars movies in Hungary have been quite ridiculous since you can't decide if Sith or Jedi is meant as singular or plural, but it has to be decided for the movie titles
Listed below are the Hungarian titles, with literal English translations in brackets
I: Baljós Árnyak (menacing shadows)
II: A klónok háborúja (the clone wars)
III: A sithek bosszúja (revenge of the sith, plural)
IV: Egy új remény (a new hope)
V: A birodalom visszavág (the empire strikes back)
VI: A jedi visszatér (return of the jedi, singular)
VII: Az ébredő erő (the awakening force)
VIII: Az utolsó jedik (the last jedi, plural)
As a fellow countrymen already spoke about Harry Potter and the LOTR, I only have on thing to say: Breaking Bad
Its called 'Totál szívás' in Hungarian and
I dont know
The name itself is indeed hard to translate, but the translation they had is just awful
I wouldnt even know how to translate it back to English but I dont think its similar enough to the original title
> The *Lord of the Rings* was translated into Hungarian by Árpád Göncz who later (in 1990) became the first president of Republic of Hungary, and was one of the most beloved politicians of the post-1990 times
However we do have a strange translation of *The Hobbit* by Tibor Szobotka
* Featuring stuff like calling the ring *szívem szottya* (\~my heart's "..." word that imitates a glump of slime/goo splashing down on the ground) instead of *drágaságom* (\~my precious)
* Translating the word hobbit as *babó* (baba = baby so its equivalent would be something like babi)
* *Gollum* is called *Nyelem* (\~i am in the process of swallowing it) for some reason instead of phonetic transcript of *Gollam
* *Tölgyfapjzsi Thorin* (Thorin out of Oakenshield)
* Midsummer night is for some reason translated as St
John's Eve - regrdless that its nonsense in the context of the book
* Shire is called *kerek ország* (\~ round country)
So its pretty strange - probably *szívem szottya* takes the gold medal out of the whole nonsense, but the other contenders are pretty strong  hve to admit
On the plus side it managed to get some stuff right - despite the complete lack of need to translate elven words
* Lembas as *kreksz* (a wordplay on *keksz* (=biscuits))
* Mirkwood as *setéterdő* (*erdő* means forest, and *setét* is a old/locally used variant on *sötét -* meaning dark)
It does
Actually, the translator actually said in this interview that he could translate his name, too, as "Fazekas Henrik" (which is the literal translation of this name), but he chose not to because it would have been silly
His job was to differentiate between the names and stuff to be translated and not to be translated
In Hungarian: "Tom Rowle Denem" -> "Nevem Voldemort"
Actually, Remus Lupin is among those few who kept their name
While Hungarian not being an indo-european language, our word for wolf is not originated in lupus anyhow (actually, "farkas" is "(animal) with tail" which is a funny realization for me right now, because normally noone ever thinks about this when saying wolf), so however the translator would have translated it to indicate the connection with a wolf, it would have been a big giveaway - I think he chose rather not to spoil the book, and kept the original name
Snape in the other hand is translated to Piton (Python)
Okay, for example:
Diagon Alley -> since this pun works only in English, it's called "Abszol út", a pun, because "abszolút" means "absolutely", but written apart means "Absol road".
As a European yes, but that is complementary of feeling I am losing a part of world heritage
Nevertheless before drawing any conclusion I am not sure whether my sense of being culturally European is the same as people of France
Same materials could be used, they can even turn to the domestic experts of [Guédelon Castle]
I lived with a Swedish guy who got (rightfully) angry at the also-Swedish neighbour and I’d never seen such aggressive passive-aggressive in all my life
He was making plans to randomly hide and put back the towels in the shared bathroom just to mess with her and spend all day on the balcony so she wouldn’t feel comfortable using it
It went well beyond notes
It's certainly
a skill
Bonus question: I've heard that Transylvania Saxon is similar to Luxembourgish
Can anyone tell how mutually intelligible these two languages are
May I ask how Transylvania Saxons come into this picture
I've read that it's similar to Luxembourgish
The swiss being neutral
Imagine my shock
The [Őszöd speech] Scandalous speech in 2006 which led to mas protests and the collapse of the MSZP party (and kinda the left too)
It would be quite important to know another language but unfortunately there are still many people here who don't speak English and struggle with language learning, especially the older generations, the situation is a bit better among university students and young adults, but still not as good as in the Nordic countries
Yet we're on the bottom in statistics
Some recent sources say we're above UK in speaking at least one foreign language, but a good percentage of that would be German
Personally I'd say hardly anyone speaks any bit of English under uni/college degree, in elementary/hs even the teachers don't speak English (my sister is currently in hs and she struggled with Duolingo basic English when she began learning in her free time cause the school is useless - my teachers weren't any different either) everything is dubbed, a major amount of internet content is available in Hungarian too, so many people just don't bother
It's pretty sad
If it's a closer friend or a relative, then i don't think it's rude
Otherwise, it's really fucking weird
If you’re a really close friend, no
If you’re not a close friend, it’s weird, rude, or some other word along these lines
I love the cleanness and just the good manners of Slovenians

Or is your PM building a dynasty and empire, has he stolen 1-2 _billion_ euro into his own pocket, partially from Europe's taxpayers
Can you top that
In the one hand I was just joking, in the other hand this phenomen is very familiar, since we also have very similar, very small-scale DMUs for the branch lines with the least passenger traffic - without the "Bzmots" those lines would have been closed for a long time now
Holy shit
I wholeheartedly support banning him from the Earth
Nah, we're good
I'm not sure who would be worse, Orban or Babic
My gut tells me Orban is worse so what the hell, we'll take that fucker
It has to be from the governments pre-approved list of names which comes from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences - Institute of Linguistics
List (in Hungarian)
There is the *Utónévkönyv* (Book of Given Names), which includes all names that can be given
New ones can be added, but they have to be requested from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
The rules for new names are:
No unisex names
If a name was already added for one gender, it cannot be added for the other
Names have to follow Hungarian orthography
Foreign names have to be written as we pronounce them (e.g. ~~Jennifer~~ Dzsenifer)
Ancient Hungarian names can only be added if they are supported by a credible source, and are not offensive
Fantasy names from Hungarian literary classics can be added if they are not offensive
Fantasy names from foreign literary classics can be added if they are already used frequently as a given name abroad
If the name has a Hungarian variant, it is recommended that it should be preferred over the foreign variant
If the foreign name has no Hungarian variant, it should be used in a foreign culture, should not be offensive, and not a unisex name
Newly created names should fit into Hungarian/European naming culture (e.g. many women are named after flowers, new flowers may be added to the list)
They should not be offensive
Nicknames should be more popular than their "official" counterparts
Geographical names are not allowed, unless the geographical name comes from a given name
Different spellings may be added, if they follow Hungarian orthography, and other names also show these spelling patterns
A variant of the name for the other gender may be added, should follow usual gender patterns
Names should not cause harm to children
> when you hear a name like Márszelusz or something
Ah, yes, and now this trend of parents giving their kids foreign names, but of course its spelling has to be made phonetically consistent with the pronunciation in order to be approved, which is how we ended up with names like Justin -> Dzsasztin and Ginger -> Dzsindzser (at least it isn't Dzsindzsör.. that'd be even worse)
Watch me name my firstborn Dzsornó Dzsovanna ...
Uhg, hate to see this practice so much
They publish a list of rejected names regularly, going through that list is extremely painful
I'm so glad we can't name babies "Koronavírus" (coronavirus) or "Karantén" (quarantine)
I pity the people in any country without regulations
Oh damn
This was a cartoon in Hungary as well :) I remember it
The "Csodák palotája", or "Palace of wonders".
It was created by a loveable old priest/teacher TV presenter, who had a program on the national television in the '50-'60s, where he taught kids physics and chemistry through simple experiments that you could replicate at home, and explained the mechanics behind them
The whole museum is an interactive playground, where kids can learn about things like  acoustics, momentum, velocity forces and gravity
Not affiliated with them, I just fucking love the place
Yay science
Not really
We all speak English and German (and our native Hungarian)
My parents learned Russian in school, but have already forgotten all of it
If we want to talk about something, and we don't want the little ones to understand it, we simply use unusual words/euphemisms
I speak more languages than my parents, but I've never heard of such thing in other families either
I'm originally from a Hungarian area in Slovakia
My parents used Slovak if they didn't want me and my brother to understand them and I always felt terrible because of that
Also I was working in a hotel in Cyprus during a summer and told everyone I was from Hungary (by that time I was really livig here)
I had a few Bulgarian coworkers there and caught them speaking ill of me
I know just enough Slovak so I could understand that they were talking about me and that they were saying mean things
They had no idea I realized what was happening
Yes, many are
>We all speak English and German (and our native Hungarian)
This refers to my family
Any sort of naïve attempt is 100% fail guarantee, so the reaction is "OK, fine you wanna maybe try and speak say English instead
?" at best
So yeah, but nah
If you want to try take at least a few weeks' course, otherwise it's useless, but it's useless anyway
In my opinion it should be a serious national effort to learn/teach at least English at least to an advanced level at a primary school level, but that's not gonna happen due to the general current moral status of the country
Well
I think most Hungarians would appreciate a foreigner who's here and trying to make an effort to learn the language, especially since the general population's English skills are not that great, and it'd also be massively appreciated because most Hungarians think it's the hardest language in the world
They might have a chance to get their point across with broken Hungarian after a few years of learning
If their knowledge of the language is 0 and they are trying to ask for directions or whatever, it’s best to stick to English or their native language and gesturing / google translating
Pronunciation is never right in these cases, often incomprehensible
Trying with words strung together from a dictionary is not annoying per se, but usually doesn’t work
And of course they don’t understand anything you’re trying to say
Thank you so much for this advice
Been learning German for quite some time now and never knew how I should interact with German speaking people since I still cannot speak the language really well
I usually just say thank you and bye in local language
I think it’s a nice touch
I am from Hungary
People in Belgium used to switch to english and I sticked to french so we both struggled
Their english was at the same level or worse than my french most of the time
The other thing that might happen occasionally, for some reason my accent in french sounds like flemish so people might switch to flemish
And there is a visible confusion, because all I can do is switch to english, but I still have no clue what they are saying
Kutyáidat sétáltatod
It was more like you sounded like flemish
Then they appologized
It happened in Brussels
In Flanders I normally start with english anyway
But I get the nationalistic vibe there

Laws are not controlling a society, just offer a reasonable way of living together
But it’s up to the people to actually follow them
If anyone wants to break to rules, it’s not impossible to do that, just penalized
Legalization is a great way to put high taxes on cannabis (like the way it’s done with tobacco) so the extra health issues could be covered by that tax money and quality control can lower the costs as well
what i'm saying is they *try* to control society, but not actually doing it, since people have the choice not to follow the law
and that's fine, i rather live in a society where i can decide if i want to follow the laws or not to follow and have it's consecvences
but since it's impossible to make everyone follow the law it's stupid to think everyone will
therefor law is more of a mutual contract between the state and the individual than an actual controlling mechanism
For some inexplicable reason, I thought sour cream was unique to Hungary and its immediate surroundings
I used to think England (I guess I didn't know the difference between England and UK back then) is a part of continental Europe
Somewhere around France and Germany
My thought process was, that such an important country (where all the cartoons on Cartoon Network come from) can't be on an island
On a similiar note, I'm hungarian, and I was convinced hungarians are the descendants of huns, because:
* HUNgary
* Attila is still a very common male name here
* It is known that Attila's fort was somewhere within the Carpathian basin, the area of historic Hungary
Turns out, all this is just a coincidence, as the earliest mentions of hungarians/Hungary never contained the 'H', it was just "Ungri".
Spain and not-Spain
There is a small village in Hungary, called Imola, but I was sure even as a child that they don't have a race track
But there was a rally stage in the past, so not that unrelated to motorsports as it sounds first

I’m really curious why you feel like that
Disagree, London has tourist attractions but the city itself is so big that most of the city is not touristy and the sheer number of Londoners "soak up" tourists
Smaller towns like Dubrovnik absolutely get wrecked by tourists because they are small
Even if on paper less tourists visit, they are just not ready for that many people

There is a pretty common surname _Lovas_. It means "horse rider".
You pronounce it like "loh-wash".
When German people see this name, they often pronounce it according to their system, so as "loh-fahss".
_Lófasz_ means "horse dick" in Hungarian
Meleg means warm and gay at the same time
Also we say "I have warm" instead of "I'm warm" when it's literally translated, but if you say "I'm warm" (Meleg vagyok), it means "I'm gay". You are supposed to say "Melegem van" or "I have warm".
Also not really grammar, but cultural I guess: Csókolom is usually a valid formal saying hi to females only, it means "kisses" roughly, and it comes off weird if you use it incorrectly on males usually

In my experience after working with Brits for a while, they are extremely polite and politically correct during working hours but once they got their pint after work they become easy going and don't spare the curse words including "fuck". So it depends on the situation
A means the
Ő is he/she
a = the
e = this (used mostly in literature)
We have "a", it means "the"
a - the
e - this
In Hungarian we have
Ő - She/he
A - The
E - Is a word that can used to make questions
S - shortened version of and (és)
Ó - Hungarian version of oh
Á - Hungarian version of ah
The only I can think of is 'a' meaning 'the'
ő - (s)he
a - the
e - this
ő - she/he/her/him
a - the
ó - (a sound to express wonder or surprise)
á - (a sound to express pain or refusal)
not really used anymore: e  - this (pointing to a close object)
not really used anymore: s - and (conjunction)
We use “a”, or “az” depending on whether the following word starts with a consonant or a vowel, as the definite article
"e" can also mean "this" in some older dialects
Ó could mean 'old'
I don't get why it is rude
To my mind to keep it being concealed is only advantageous for companies
It is, I dont even know how much my closer family makes
Imo its one of the topics that are taboo right now but it really shouldn't be
Maybe he doesn't even know
I don't think my dad knows the exact figure, because tax is confusing
I would say it isn’t. I talk about wages and financial topics with my family and friends
I tell my salary to anyone if the question is valid for some reason
On the other hand at the company we don’t talk about salary with the colleges
We don’t want to get into an awkward situation if someone finds out he/she earns less for the same job
This is very common in Hungary
I guess it depends on people toon then, may not really be a country dependent thing
I was always taught never to talk about or ask about how much anyone made
Green by far, only ever see black olives on pizza
Even then it's 50/50, depends on the place
I see both, but maybe green olives are a bit more popular, I'm not entirely sure
I personally only buy green ones
I was told that the black ones sold here are mostly artificially dyed
I don't know if it's true, but I always read the ingredients, and black olives tend to contain iron or something
I just go with products that have minimal or no additives
I live in Slovakia, only the south and east of slovakia is bilingual, most people speak Hungarian better than Slovak
The road signs are in Slovak and Hungarian
The town where I live has a population of about 9K and i only know maybe 20 people who dont speak Hungarian
We have Hungarian Schools
If we want to ask a stranger for directions when we are not in East or South Slovakia the first question always is "Do you speak Hungarian
" And we are very happy when they reply "Igen" :D
(*cough* *cough* its hungarian territory after all *cough*)
(Vesszen trianon
Oh my God, this is why I love Reddit
i and everyone around me started going to school alone at 12-13, before that, only those who lived really close could leave (but didn't really, because the parents were not at home yet)
(my school was somewhere between the outskirts and the city centre; no family houses, more cars and some wider roads so i don't think i would have let my child walk there with a light heart)
It depends
If the school is close, children probably walk to school from an early age
Later on, those living further away switch to public transport, mostly when starting secondary education around age 15
Not hungary
Source: the pub is 2 streets away and im lost
Our earliest texts are from the 1200s. In their original written form, they are mostly unintelligible, but if they transcribe it to modern spelling, they can be understood quite well
Poems and texts from the 16th century are basically modern Hungarian with a weird spelling
It can be understood really well
Our earliest writings in Hungarian are from the late 12th and the mid 13th century
If we're talking about the original writing and letters, then apart from some words, it is really hard to understand it
So its like with hungarian
Mostly the same, problems are words that have been forgotten
The first written complete Hungarian sentence that we know of accidentally slipped into a latin document in 1055, the establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany
"feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea"
When you first see it it's strange and doesn't look like Hungarian at all, but once it is translated to modern Hu you're like "oh yeah, that makes sense".
In modern Hungarian it's: "Fehérvárra menő hadi útra".
In English: "to the military road going to Fehérvár (lit
White Castle)"
"Rea" became what's today the -ra and -re suffixes, meaning the word "to" in English
What's interesting is that the -reá suffix is still in use today in some dialects/accents
Later texts come from the 13rd century, for example the "Old Hungarian lamentations of Mary". When transcribed to today's alphabet it sounds strange but mostly understandable
Its mostly spelling issues and a few words here and there that are not used anymore, if you know thedifferences in spelling (as both back then and cureently spelling is phonetic), you can get the meaning
Forgetting articles i guess is pretty common
For example in hungarian you'd say "i eat apple" without an article so people often leave it out
The same with occupations (i am teacher)
My mom always mixes up her “he” and “she”. Like calling a guy she and a girl he because in Hungarian we don’t have those words
In Hungarian -ig means until
"Csináld meg keddig" - do it by Tuesday
Most Hungarians will say do it until Tuesday
Also verb tenses
And word order
In fact a lot of things
Hungarian is just so different
Hungarian has a rather unique array of sounds and pronounciation, we tend to pronounce words as if they were hungarian
It doesn't sound natural at all
[Edit: Spelling mistake]
Word order, because in Hungarian word order is not as strict as English
He/She and other gender specific things, because Hungarian is a genderless language
Pronunciation, English spoken by Hungarians is usually rough and blocky
We rather have 44 letters in the alphabet than pronounce one letter differently, like G and J in English can be tricky
In Hungarian, we don't have an order in our sentences
I mean while the stressed part of the sentence differs, the overall meaning can be the same in sentences composed of the same words but in different order
This fluidity translates to people trying to speak english, not understanding that they have to start the sentence in a given way to get the desired result
We use suffixes for everything basically
These result in the google translator being absolutely clueless when it comes to translating to or from hungatian sentences
Other than that, people usually either know english or don't. Becouse of strong nationalism the overwhelming majority doesn't know any second language
We make photos here as well
If I'd get a dollar for every time I hear someone misuse "make" I'd be rich
Hungarian doesn't have it either and most people say "Vhat
Vhere
Vhen
Hángérijen hez ö ráder juník öréj áf száundz end pronánsziésön, ví tend tu pronáunsz vördz ez if déj vör hángérijen
It dázönt száund necsuröl et all
But we also have the verb "fényképezni" (\~to photo)
I feel called out
Lyesz, veri
Jú méd mi fílájz det áj hev méd ö spelling miszték
Have to agree
I never met anyone who can speak english and says it's thanks to their school
It's always learnt home with some or no help from school
I see nothing wrong with it :P
Well, it's misuse in English, but I won't argue with the common sense point, it's true
English is weird
Meanwhile in Hungarian: *jelenleg* (currently) and *tulajdonképpen* (actually)
well, normal stuff
name, where you live, date of birth
no religion
They started issuing [these] in 2000
Accordingly to the law every citizen has to have one from age 14 and always have it in public
They're valid for 6 years and from 2016 if you requested or the old one expired you get the [electronic one]
I saw one in Hungary
I work at a customer service
Think the guy was very proud of his origin then
Huh, good to know
We Hungarians had these a long, long time ago too (I never had the "old" ID), not many people in their 20's know it even existed before which is funny in my opinion
1600: Buda
1700: Buda
1800: Pest
1900: Budapest
Now: Budapest
In 1600 it might have been Pozsony (now Bratislava), as Buda was under ottoman control
But Pest-Buda was still two cities, and Pest was the bigger one
I thought I will go with the biggest city of the Porta to not ruin the joke, but you are right
The two cities were located on the two opposite sides of the Danube, so they were indeed very close
And the divider is basically the river Danube, which I guess answers the question about the clear divide
its because slovakians have a diffrent language
and bratislava is the city name in hungarian
Well yes, in the 1700s-1800s Pest developed way faster than Buda did, so you'll find styles of that era way more there (it's similar to a typical Paris downtown cityscape)
Buda, on the other hand, has the castle district mostly built to its form today in the 1700s. Buda is also quite hilly which gives less space to larger buildings
It consists of suburban areas at a higher rate than Pest, you don't have to go far from the Danube to find detached houses on the hillside, often owned by higher class people
Buda and Óbuda (another town that was independent until the unification, just north of Buda) also have a lot more remains of Roman buildings
The layout is more organized in Pest with boulevards and avenues, while the Buda side is a bit more spaghetti if you know what I mean (because of hills and less dense traffic)
They made a conscious effort to eradicate Hungarian/German names and invent new ones, often naming towns after Slovak nationalists
This was especially common for formerly (or even currently) Hungarian majority towns like Bős which used to be Beš but was renamed to Gabčíkovo
Yeah Slovaks went the extra mile with that
Interestingly enough they kept the 2nd biggest city's name (Kassa -> Košice)
I started learning mostly from the internet, around 12-13 years old
I basically trained myself up to B2-C1 levels until highschool, where I actually took it as a third language (my second language is German)
I finished the 4 year course in half a year and took a B2+ level exam with no review and with an 92%
The joke here
I've been learning German for over 9 years now and I still can't string 5 coherent sentences together
My tips: hearing is the best form of learning, if it has subtitles, even better
Videogames are great for this purpose too
I started in middle-school, I think I was 10 or 11
I wasn't great until high-school, where the teacher made it compulsory to read at least one book in English during the year
The school library had books that were made for this exact purpose,so they were small stories with easy to understand language
About speaking though, you just gotta find opportunities to speak
There are no easy ways around it
Edit: Left out the obvious gaming, and watching series/movies in English
With English subs but dubbed, then English with native subs, and slowly I left the subtitles all together
Well, technically I started to learn it in kindergarten, but the lessons were ridiculous (that teacher's suicide didn't help the class's studies) until near the end of 7th grade when my parents hired a different teacher to supervise me personally, so I could get in the highschool I wanted
Besides, I watch a lot of videos, animes, read books, mangas
I started in 4th grade in elementary school, so around the age of 10
I was mediocre at best
Then I discovered One Direction when I was 12, and since they weren't that popular here, there was very little material about them in Hungarian, mostly just fanfictions
So I started to listen to a LOT of their interviews, and eventually I just caught up
Grammar was just there in my brain, but I was lazy af to learn vocabulary, but somehow I still managed to memorise everything that interested me
I was still afraid to speak, since my teacher said I speak like a toddler in English (7th grade, age 12), so she cannot understand me, I shouldn't ever speak
Then came ASMR (don't laugh, there are really amazing ones)
The first video I watched was by MinxLaura123, she's a really sweet British girl, her accent is everything
Basically while I slept, I was listening to her nearly every night
I went to a private teacher to get extra lessons for a state accredited language exam, and I warned her that she might not be able to understand me
She told me no worries, just say whatever comes to my mind during our conversation
She was SHOCKED, because (in her opinion) I had a perfect British accent
I was like, no way, I've never even been there, how is this even possible
I was successful on the exam on the first try (at the age of 16)
Now I get to speak nearly every day, since I play an MMORPG with an international guild, and I am the Program Coordinator in my university's ESN section
I started learning it on the internet at a pretty early age
I only had my first english class by the time I was in 9th grade and I was already fluent (However my pronunciation was, and still is horrible, but I have the same issue with Hungarian because I have a lisp, so I don't think I can really make big improvements)
So yeah, basically the internet taught me the language, and since then I've been trying to improve my vocab and pronunciation during English classes
I never learned english, i just started playing video games, and started watching youtube videos in english
This obviously means that, i dont speak the language very well, but i think people can understand me, and i can understand the language fully
The only problem i have is pronunciaton, but im looking forward to improve it
My father taught me the basics when I was 3, after that, I used the internet in my free time a lot, so when I got to play Minecraft for the first time when I was around 5-6 I started watching a lot of videos, most of them were English
I didn't understand much, but I didn't use dictionaries or translator applications, I learned almost everything by myself
I am 15 currently and still looking for ways to improve, I watch anime with English subtitles and started reading the Harry Potter saga in English
YouTube vids and video games help a lot too in expanding my vocabulary
I learned english in autodidact way
I study it just since september, because I studied german before highschool
I never took an english class before coming to 9th grade, but I needed to take a test to prove my english knowledge
They putted me in the 11th grade english class where some students already took the language exam - and I was there with 0 experience in the language and my grammar and speaking was horrible at the time
I came down to the 10th grade english class, and I am there since then (still in 9th grade)
My grammar is still not great, but I improved a bit
(I only knew american and australian accent before, so the beginnings were a little bit confusing with the good old british accent)
I understand english speak really well (even the dialects) and some complex scientific studies written in the language (my language skills' 50% is from these geology related studies)
If I can, I watch movies and videos with english subtitles
There is a few words that I can't really translate to my mother language because I didn't learned english through hard studying and dictionaries - I can't really explain this
If I write or read something, I see it in my mind in english, not in hungarian
Edit: btw, hungarian language education system sucks
I'm in a private school, this is why there are language groups
Most of the other schools have grade based teaching system, but my school has a knowledge based
I study german since I was 10 years old (in 4th grade) with the usual way
And I barely understand the memes from r/ich_iel .
I went to Ljubljana initially for one semester and I liked it so much I stayed for a second one
I don't think it's many people's first choice but it absolutely should be
Slovenia is a gorgeous country, there is everything from mountains to seas and since Ljubljana is in the middle of the country everything is at most two hours away
We took ridiculously cheap daytrips to Italy (14€ for a return ticket to Venice), Austria and Croatia
Ljubljana itself is great, it's cozy, completely bikeable (they have their own vintage bikes, they're everywhere) and it has lots of cultural events, insane christmas decoration, parties and 4€ subsidized student meals in restaurants
/promo
Seriously
Sometimes the unpopular destinations are hidden gems
Once I met a Finnish guy who spent his Erasmus in my hometown
A town with population of 160k, in Northeast Hungary (one of the worst regions)
It's boring as fuck and almost noone speaks English here
I have no idea how he ended up here
My friend went their too and he absolutely loved it
The photos he took there absolutely made me want to travel to Slovenia
Hahaha wtf
I mean Turkey is a nice destination for Erasmus, I was there too, but
Kayseri
What a weird choice
Btw it's the twin town/sister city (or whatever that's called) of my hometown and I'm kinda disappointed, but my hometown isn't a cool place either so I guess that's fair
But I honestly wonder how an Erasmus student would deal with the language barrier in that part of Turkey, though
That depends
It's a great experience for getting out of your environment and living somewhere else, but other than that, it's up the individual what they do with this opportunity
Some people just want to party, some want to travel as much as possible (that's pretty common), or make new friends from other countries, or learn/practice a language
Yeah some focus on their education but that's not the majority
My main requirement for the host uni was to be in Turkey
Preferably in a nice part of it
That's it, I went for Erasmus to spend a few months in Turkey (and get away from my home uni, as far as possible)
I lucked out, my uni has a partnership with a private uni in Turkey which has most of its classes in English, including my field
It was honestly the best year of my education and the most useful as well
Why though
Sometimes, but only with groups I know well and clothes/mannerisms/context help
For example, Germans and Austrians look essentially the same physically, but Austrians dress better and talk louder *in general*. And there are broad tendencies, like Slavs tend to have somewhat softer features than Germanic people
Some people really fit the "typical look" of their ethnicity, but most don't.
But it’s just educated guesses and people guess wrong a lot, too
I’ve been mistaken for everything from Estonian to Turkish, with half of Slavdom in between
I am Turkish I live in Hungary and I can spot Turkish people with very little chance of miss, I just wait for them to talk to celebrate my success in this guessing game
Rectangular jaw + gülü eyes = German
Almost always works
That’s funny
I always recognise Hungarians because of the accent
Even if they speak English really well, it’s just unmistakable
Well best translation is googly eyes
Food packaging is the big one, and it is hard to limit that
I don't buy raw veggies in packaging (unless it's something like spinach)
Cut down on meat, espacially beef and lamb
Switch to solid soap instead of liquid and shower gel, if your skin is fine with it
Don't buy things you don't need
Minimalism is green
Don't buy overly specific cleaning products
I have bleach, vinegar, dish soap, a green all-surface cleaner, and coconut fiber sponges for the whole appartment
Buy second-hand clothing and furniture
> Don't use plastic bags when buying fruit and vegetables
Adding to this, for those who live somewhere you have to weigh your produce by yourself, get mesh reusable produce bags
They usually have a cloth flap for the weight/price sticker, so you can just peel off the sticker and reuse the bag
Egy szó, mint száz/one word like a hundred
This is like skipping the content of a story and just saying the end or a summary, I think (maybe I'm wrong, I'm sorry in that case)
I don't know if it's common somewhere but my grandpa used to say the following: "If I'm dead don't asl why my feet are so cold" reffering not to ask stupid questions
Here it's "don't make an elephant from a tick". Or, in rare cases, the English phrase with literal translation
Elírtad bástya h didn't stand in line
I wanted to ask this when I read OP
Does the product Extrawurst come from this idiom or umgekehrt
I mean I always thought it means "you're not getting Extrawurst" means you're not getting that type of meat product (because it used to be a special delicacy etc, so you're not special etc)
I never thought it would mean "you're not getting an additional portion of Wurst
" Actually, the more I'm thinking about it, the less probable it seems I was right
Btw, there is a Hungarian idiom "Nincs extrawurst
" meaning exactly the same, "you're not getting special treatment".
Furthermore: this kind of Wurst is called "párizsi" or "parizer" in Hungarian
But Pariser means something different in German
So it could cause further confusion
EDIT:
From wiktionary
> Pariser (Deutsch)
> Substantiv, m
> [1] Einwohner der Stadt Paris
> [2] umgangssprachlich: Kondom
Btw, die Wurstart ist auch erwähnt
In Hungary, it's a flea and an elephant
The flea as a metaphor for tinyness appears in other contexts as well
I thought it means "condom". But you didn't answer my main question
> Side note, why can't Microsoft or google just make one English version that has all the differences as correct
Because there isn't an official version that lists the correct versions, where does Word get these forms
Bruh, everyone knows that in Switzerland everyone speaks switzerlandese, theres no other language there
And people try to covince me about “german” and “french” and whatnot
Any reason the exclude landlocked countries
Lakes can have beaches too
Either Omega or Leander Kills
Also Paddy and the Rats is a lot of fun
This is definitely one of the most famous Hungarian rock songs ever, but I'm still surprised when people abroad say they know it haha (Kanye sampled the song without permission, got sued for it and had to pay to the band, that story still makes me laugh a bit)
Flair up
I can't link at the moment but its in "New Slaves"
Hungarians don't do that petty inter-city rivalry
With us, it's Budapest against the whole rest of the country
Those who dwell in the capital are   living in the "vízfej", or airhead (as in large, and contains nothing of value), whereas if you live anywhere else, you are a "vidéki", (a hick from the countryside)
We do a lot of things wrong, but damn, if you need to make fun of someone, we shine
So what you’re saying is, there’s a Split between the two cities
\>  Hungarians don't do that petty inter-city rivalry
I mean, noting close to Manchester vs
Liverpool, but it's not uncommon even for neighboring villages
There are smaller rivalries such as Sopron vs Győr but nothing significant
Read carefully what I wrote: as a clearly superior Budapester, I don't give a rat's ass what the vidéki people do
...aaand both are vidék, therefore no one (that matters) cares
:D See where I'm going with this
I don't know why you are talking about the capital of Romania
As Hungarian doesn't really have dialects (it does have them, but sadly, not many people speak them anymore), dialects in the English language are usually dubbed using some weird, obsolete slang to get closer to it
Not quite an animated movie, but quite interesting:
In the last James Bond movie, there is a character who speaks German in the English version
In the German dubbing, the character speaks Hungarian, voiced by an actress from Northern Transylvania
Inside Hungary our dialects dont really differ from eachother, so it feels like we dont even have different dialects
But with hungarians who live outside of today's Hungary its's a little bit harder to understand eachother
For example Transylvanians have a weird accent
There aren't many, only a few, for example near our Northern Middle Mountains (sorry I don't know for sure if this is the English version of "Északi középhegység") but it's not THAT different from the official language
But those Hungarians who live in Transilvania
When we talk with each other, I nearly can't understand them
Especially the csángós
Yes, I only know like one grammatical difference which makes me able to tell if someone is from the western or eastern part of Hungary, and like 5 expressions that we use differently
I don't think we have different accents, but Hungarians who live outside the borders do have a little different accent, probably because the country they live in and the language influenced them
It's the same with some words they use, they use some different words, but really not much, also because of the influence of the other language
The older generation also has some of their own words and expressions that are different in different parts of the country, but only the old people use them, it almost entirely died in the younger generation
I wonder why we don't have dialects, in which era did they make it disappear
Also, why don't we use anymore the vocabulary of the older people
Maybe because they are too far away in another country so they developed differently
Are you talking about transylvanian romanians
Just cuz i was talking about transylvanian hungarians
Since i was talking about hungarian dialects
I dont know romanian dialects obviously
Bruh
Its okay
I just dont speak romanian since i dont live in romania lol
Yeah
As you said its probably because of different nations living next to eachother
Tell this to Mr
Orbán
So can I eat french fries in Belgium
Wilhelm II rattled his saber ever since the 1890s. Him and by addition Germany created the international atmosphere, which allowed matters to escalate into a full-blown war in the first place
Therefore, I believe, the blame falls on them rightfully
Well an Anschluß is certanly *a solutiun* to that whole conundrum
Not the most elegant one, but hey
It was meant to be a joke, but thanks for the information
Danke
I'm self-taught in German, so I make mistakes like that sometimes

Q.E.D. ;)
We had folklore classes in fifth grade
Schools could choose between that and drama
I like learning about my country's culture, but I didn't like the teacher
After WWI half of Komárom went to Slovakia because it was on the other bank of the Danube, but that's the only one I know of
Sátoraljaújhely
Very similar case but I think they were two different administrative units while Komárom was one town
Yep
It is the former railway station of Sátoraljaújhely, complete with a former industrial zone plus two farm complexes
Awarding the station to Czechoslovakia was deemed necessary, as it lay on the only railway connecting Kassa to Munkács
Now, if someone was to ask the reasons why Munkács was deemed to have been a true Czechoslovakian city at the time
and how it came to be a true Soviet city in only 25 years
or how it became a true Ukrainian city by 1991
:-)
Well on Google maps I can see Nagylak/Nadlac (near Serbia on the hungarian-romanian border) on both sides of the border so I guess it counts as one
Somebody had ran out of creativity in 1920 - but managed to come up with a patriotic name, nevertheless
It's not Cold War Berlin, I strongly assume, but don't have the time at the moment to look up details on local border crossings
The railway border crossing is listed as a functional border crossing in the legislation currently in force
I don't know anything more
The Hungarian revolution of 1848
In Hungary most view it as a just cause against an oppressive foreign dynasty which tried to assimilate minorities
Which is fair point, however a lot of Hungarians forgot that under the revolution we also tried to do the same with minorities within the Hungarian borders
Also from that period Croatians have a national hero called Josip Jelačić, who in Hungary is regarded as a kind of traitor who allied with the oppressive Habsburgs to take down the Hungarian revolution
Not just about who was there first but also about what nationality the land is
Like
(?)
Same goes with their ‘54 title :((
> Same goes for Slovakia
Not really, sane people don't debate Slovaks were here first
It's generally accepted by all sides that Croats and Slovaks were here before us but Serbs came later (fleeing the Ottomans)
This who came first debate is only between us and Romanians
We even have a legend about making a deal with your king Svatopluk for the lands
Our bone to pick with Slovakia mostly comes down to you getting a bit too generous of a deal after WWI and haven't exactly treated us well in the last 100 years
Haha well I wouldn’t say you didn’t deserve it - you won, and that’s it
We’re just bitter because we were sooo close :(
> It’s quite a shame honestly, since our nations have so much in common, it’s just that we kind of disregarded it for the last two centuries
Exactly, culturally Slovaks are one of the closest to us, sucks that recent times have turned us against each other
> That’s actually interesting, do you have a link to this legend
Couldn't find a direct link to this in English, so I'll copypaste it from a longass wikipedia page
It's called "legend of the white horse".
*The legend narrates that the Hungarians purchased their future homeland in the Carpathian Basin from Svatopluk for a white horse harnessed with gilded saddle and reins:*
Then [Kusid] came to the leader of the region who reigned after Attila and whose name was Zuatapolug, and saluted him in the name of his people [...]
On hearing this, Zuatapolug rejoiced greatly, for he thought that they were peasant people who would come and till his land; and so he dismissed the messenger graciously
[...] Then by a common resolve [the Hungarians] despatched the same messenger again to the said leader and sent to him for his land a big horse with a golden saddle adorned with the gold of Arabia and a golden bridle
Seeing it, the leader rejoiced all the more, thinking that they were sending gifts of homage in return for land
When therefore the messenger asked of him land, grass and water, he replied with a smile, "In return for the gift let them have as much as they desire
" [...] Then [the Hungarians] sent another messenger to the leader and this was the message which he delivered: "Arpad and his people say to you that you may no longer stay upon the land which they bought of you, for with the horse they bought your earth, with the bridle the grass, and with the saddle the water
And you, in your need and avarice, made to them a grant of land, grass and water
" When this message was delivered to the leader, he said with a smile: "Let them kill the horse with a wooden mallet, and throw the bridle on the field, and throw the golden saddle into the water of the Danube
" To which the messenger replied: "And what loss will that be to them, lord
If you kill the horse, you will give food for their dogs; if you throw the bridle on the field, their men will find the gold of the bridle when they mow the hay; if you throw the saddle into the Danube, their fishermen will lay out the gold of the saddle upon the bank and carry it home
If they have earth, grass and water, they have all
[source]
The gist of it is that the messenger asked for things that symbolize the territory (that small grant of earth, grass and water meant all the land and rivers he owned) so when he agreed to this seemingly insignificant symbolic gesture he actually sold his lands in exchange for a horse
So uhm, yeah
cunning and trickery is a big part of our folklore
It took a huge downturn - then came a little midget and pushed it even lower, but with lots of money this time

Leszarjuk Ceaucescu-t személyesen
Te szép gyergyói út,
Langyos esti szél a fülembe súg.
Az lesz majd szép idő, az lesz majd jó idő
Akkor majd őkelme nem lesz nyerő.
An old obsession of mine,
is to roll by tank through Romania
On a big Tiger tank,
holding grenades in both of our hands
Beautiful road to Giurgeu,
The warm night wind whispers in my ear
It will be beautiful time, it will be a good time,
then Ceaucescu won't be so fine
An old obsession of mine,
is to roll by tank through Romania
On a nice big Tiger tank,
we'll shit on Ceaucescu ourselves
Beautiful road to Giurgeu,
the warm night wind whispers in my ear
It will be beautiful time, it will be a good time,
then his majesty won't be so fine
Well, to be fair, we aren’t the only ones around here who are sensitive
I guess pretty much every country around Hungary has a bone to pick with Hungary, and vice versa
Maybe we would be if we would understand a word of it
I play nations with unusual position or religion, or do something that's not historically accurate in the Extended Timeline mod
Reforming Babylon, spreading the Nabataean religion, remaining Hellenic as Rome, creating a druidist colonial empire as Ireland, etc
EU4: Hungary for patriotic reasons, Byzantium for the glory of Rome, Shimazu for the lulz and rebels for spectation
Vic2: Only played a few hours with Austria
I colonised Afghanistan, but it didn't end well
HOI4: Hungary to restore Austria-Hungary, Spain to restore the Spanish Empire, Japan to improve my island hopping skills, Poland to see how long I can last and Cuba to spectate
Wow, CK2 is way harder for me than EU4
*Jászfelsőszentgyörgy* it is
Though a lot of villages were administratively unified in the last 100 years, so the historical recorders, that don’t exist on their own anymore are: *Reformátuskovácsháza*, *Péliföldszentkereszt* and *Nemesboldogasszonyfa*.
According to the Internet, it is Jászfelsőszentgyörgy
Jászfelsőszentgyörgy (Jász Upper Saint George)
Historically, it used to be Alsórásztok és Felsőrásztok (Upper Rásztok and Lower Rásztok, now part of Liptovský Mikuláš, Slovakia), followed by Nyugotifelsőszombatfalva (Western Upper Saturday Village, now part of Sâmbăta de Sus, Romania)
The longest name in historical Hungary that still survives is Szépkenyerűszentmárton (Saint Martin With A Beautiful Bread, now Sânmartin, Romania)
Greetings from Hódmezővásárhely
Well, yeah, you are right
This is by characters, but if you go by letters, it’s not valid
What is the first city you will want to visit once travelling will be as easy and hassle free as before and why
Bilbao with Erasmus+
I hope it won't be cancelled, I am so excited
My grandpa's grave in Sümeg, Hungary
Other than that, we had a booked room in Ljubljana for April, which didn't happen, but I would like to go there when the pandemic ends (not just the lockdown, but the pandemic as well)
The Hague
Amazing city, and I've learnt some Dutch as well since my last visit, so I'm definitely looking forward to it
i live in Hungary, and have a picture of a Mongolian licence plate, that looked pretty cool
Kukac
It means "worm" or "maggot". I don't know why is it called that tho because it doesn't look like a worm to me
We call it "Kukac", which means "Maggot" or "Worm" because it looks like a long worm
Kukac is kind of a  light-hearted word, generally used by kids
We don't say "at" here, everyone refers to it as kukac, formal or not
In hungarian we call it”kukac” which means maggot or worm
Maybe the a part is the head and the rest is the tail
Or that's my thinking
Well you can call a dick kukac in Hungarian but it's rather informal and childish basically the equivilant of "peepee".
Yes
Poland
Austria, Germany, Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia, Slovenia, Czechia
Rest of Europe
China
Rest of Asia
Rest of the World
Poland, Croatia, Germany and Slovenia, y'all are cool
Sure, the list is roughly:
Germany
Austria
Ireland
Any EU country
The underdog
Germany, many hungarians cheer for the german  national team
Well, as I have an indigenous minority background, if there is no other aspect, I will support the country with stronger minority rights
But overall, I love Slovakians as well and would cheer for them if there was let's say a Brazil-Slovakian final
I've been there and everyone was very friendly, plus I feel sorry for them, can't really see a bright future for Macedonians, especially after Macron's refusal
The foreign exchange students looked a bit horrified, when i told them that by the time i arrive at the party i already had 5-6 shots and atleast just as many beers
I mean it’s not a real party if don’t „lay the foundation“ before arriving
But booze is cheaper at home
I hoped someone would mention Queen Valentina in the comments
Iconic
Also I like your username
Same thing will happen as with North Korea
A lot of talk and muscle flexing, a few rocks will be throw but everyone will remain in their corners
Wasn't that the point of declaring them a terrorist org in the first place
So they can circumvent the Congress when they need to
I guess that category was initially designed for fanatic boys with bombs, but this one was an official entity (from what I've gathered) of an internationally recognized state
Which is a very different flavour, even if their "job" is similar
I hope you're implying the US is the wolf in this analogy, my dear turtle
Yep
I'd rather be a healthy productive citizen than a sociopath
Russia
Everyone except Russia
Don't worry, you used to this, why would it change
With what
We don't have an army
We only have some Griffins which we let patrol in the Baltic states' airspace
The former
We do have some kind of Retro Milk Bar, but I'm not sure if it's still open
I don't think anyone thinks of them as such, and they're definitely not also tourist destinations like Polish milk bars, but we have lunch-only places called étkezdék. I think they started as worker lunch places in communist times for people who didn't work in a factory with its own canteen
They're fewer and father between these days, but they have a certain rustic charm: huge portions, generally a rotating menu, often you just tell them what you ordered when you leave instead of getting a bill, usually shared seating at tables
And obviously still cheap
Haven't been to one in years but now you've got me wanting to go :)
Szomorú vasárnap
People don't listen to it for long
I think you misunderstood the question
In Hungarian, I think he speaks completely normally, with the exception of some "unusual" phrases (e.g. swearing)
What do you call a cheat sheet in your language that you would typically use on a test
What does it mean
In Hungarian it's called a puska which means gun
Small correction: as OP has said we use the word "puska", but the direct translation is rifle not gun
it's very interesting, there's a Hungarian word salabakter (pron
šalabakter) that comes from the German word Schaarwachter, and means an old fashioned and aged man
it's very interesting, there's a Hungarian word salabakter (pron
šalabakter) that comes from the German word Schaarwachter, and means an old fashioned and aged man
Yeah 'puska' in Hungarian is the thing you smuggle in to exams and try to use it to cheat without the teachers knowing
You must have something like that
actually when I was in primary school we used to write the cheat-sheet onto the sole if our shoes
you just sat cross-legged and you could read it
In some dialects ficujka is a piece of small paper like a post-it note
I guess there's a correlation there
It seems like it's a German loan word in Transylvanian dialects of Hungarian and Romanian
It still amazes me how foreign the concept (as in cheating on exams) seems to be to you guys
Sounds like an awesome thing in this day and age
Expelled as in expelled from the school altogether without any opportunity to take the exam later or just from the exam
For us if they catch you cheating you will automatically fail the exam but you will be allowed to take it at a later time
Obviously they will watch you even more closely the next time
In my primary school the students were able to decide if they need a locker or not, and if so they had to pay for it, so not a lot of students had lockers
In secondary school we have no lockers, i belive it's not really common in other schools
Hungary - I'm going with mostly no, but I've seen schools where 3 to 5 students shared a locker for coats
No lockers
We always carry everything in backpacks
I went to 3 different schools in the course of my schoolkid life:
Grade 1-4: In the school where I went to these grades, everyone had 1 coat hanger and a shelf to place your dirty shoes + keep the shoes you wear in the classrooms
Since each class had their own room and every student their own desk, we kept books inside the desks
From grade 5 I recall seeing that they had lockers outside of the classrooms, but they were on a different floor and I rarely went there, so I'm not sure
Grade 5-8: Different school, here we had small lockers at the back of the classrooms and coat hangers outside, on the wall of the corridor
We had to move around for different courses and other classes came to our room as well, so we were advised not to leave anything in the desks
From grade 9 classes were in another building, there they had bigger lockers on the corridors and the coat hangers were inside the classrooms
Grade 9-12: Switched schools again
No coat hangers, but the corridors were full of lockers so we kept everything in them
We usually carried our coats around and just put them on the chair we sat on
Books, PE equipment and anything and everything else were kept in the lockers
Now I must remark that I was lucky enough to attend better than average schools, so this might not be true for all Hungarian schools
In my school we do, but that is not the norm around the country
It is more of an exeption
Hungary - some schools do, but most don't, I guess
The ones I went to had bigger lockers for the whole class, usually 2 or 3 lockers for one class (20-35 students) just outside of your main classroom and they were used for storing coats and gym bags (and for little kids, like 10 year olds and under, shoes they switch into in colder months), and other stuff that you'd bring home in the evening (like huge art folders some arts students used)
Either it didn't have a lock at all (super safe, lol), or it had and everyone who used that one specific locker had a copy of the key
Storing books in these was pretty much forbidden, but some people tried, anyway, at least the most rarely used books
Yes, we had to carry our books all the time, yes, I have bad posture indeed
In older school buildings that don't have these lockers/wardrobes they usually have an area in each classroom to hang your coats and maybe some shelves to store other stuff
You don’t have lockers
I never heard of a higyschool (középiskola) not having it
Of primary schools i have no clue, mine had one for everyone
I know nothing of primary schools in general, i never heard of a secondary school/középiskola not having them
I always had one
It seemd so natural, i never thought that it’s not the case everywhere
In secondary school/középiskola
Lmao it seems like our secondary school is less bourgey than your one
To be fair i live in a smaller town so that can be the reason
I shared one with 5 others in primary school, and didn’t have any in secondary (we had hangers in the classroom but not lockers)
I guess mine was the exception
How can I get a Hungarian tag
10⁶ millió
10⁹ milliárd
10¹² billió
10¹⁵ billiárd
It seems like all other european languages have the same system, but am i the only one that thinks the english system makes much more sense
Subreddit >> 3 dots on the right up >> change user flair (on phone)
Identical to Hungarian, milló and milliárd, respectively
Köszönöm szépen

Melancholy
Hungary has the oldest underground railway in continental Europe
The largest thermal cave system in the world is also located under Budapest
The city also has the highest number of thermal springs in the world
VAT is 27%, which is the highest in the world
We also had the biggest inflation ever recorded between 1945 and 1946
In 1944 the highest banknote value was 1000 pengő. In 1946 it was 10^20 pengő.
Our language is also kinda unique
Being poor with social inequality breeds desperate people
Funny how times have changed
Portugal means South-East-West now
Only weirdos do it, which makes me one of them I guess
Only on private tours
Local busses usually have a closed driver's cabin, it would also be kind of awkward if you exit on the back door
Hell no
I dont care
I feel like its very easy to sort of manipulate what goes on the front page of Reddit, and the hatred towards China feels like is generated by a certain group or something
I understand the thing and I also feel like China is doing China things, and thats not good
But at the same time it makes me sick, I dont want to see this on r/all every single day
I just dont care that much
And its not just r/all
almost every thread, let it be on r/games, r/europe, even here, has a comment or two about China
It really does feel like the Soros-hatred in Hungary to me in a way
If there is a problem, of course its because of China
This
Using a gaming event to push your political views will most likely not be tolerated, it shouldn't come as a surprise
Blizzard just did what anyone could've predicted
Probably the same thing would've happened in any other similar case, China or HK got nothing to do with it
You can't just break the rules then play the martyr when you get punished
That being said they've handled this poorly and went a bit too far with the punishments
Oh this is good
This should be stickied somewhere
We dont have to go far to find similar cases in sports either, just in the World Cup there was quite a backlash about Armenian Swiss footballers showing the Armenian Eagle in the match against Serbia(? I think)
They got their fine aswell
These sort of things are just not supposed to be in a gaming event, from either side
>  "Every Voice Matters"
"Holocaust is a scam and Hillary Clinton is a lizard" - does this matter too
Don't be overdramatic
Besides, there's a time and place for everything and these things have no place at gaming events
No, Finland is the testicles and Sweden is the dick body
Norway does not exist and expensive
lol true
I've written here once that this is a running joke also for Hungary
It began when a very good humorist once said that "the form of state of Hungary (meaning the political system) is that of the Wiener Schnitzel".
Or another time "From the Kingdom of Hungary-formed Wiener Schnitzel I ate Transylvania off".
>Kaiserreich-Germany
You mean like in the game or historically
Yes and not hat hard as it seems at first sight
Why is that relevant
I can tell based on what kind of mistakes they make, a sentence structure error is a dead givaway
I'm not the best with accents, but I would probably still notice that too
Sometimes when Slavs speak English (especially someone who isn't fluent yet) they tend to omit articles, which I think is kinda cute, but it's also a dead giveaway
Usually it's really easy
However, you can take up on people's accents around you
For example I speak with, in my opinion, a strong Hungarian accent with a bit of British accent mixed it because I worked with Brits for a few years years
I have a Latvian friend whose accent is similar to the South African accent
If you are surrounded by one particular way of speaking, you will slowly speak that way unconsciously
Mostly yes, especially if they originally speak my language, because I can hear mistakes I would/did make
One of my biggest achievement in the English language was when I started using fewer and less correctly
Before that, I'd just use **less** with everything
You'd be surprised how many native English speakers use *would of*.
It absolutely makes my blood boil
It bothers me more than it should
We say “fűbe harap” which means “bit the grass” so the same as in German
We have that as well only we say “to smell the violet from underneath” (alulról szagolja az ibolyát)
We say "give in the key". Apparently this comes from an old practice, when  a person living in an apartment came home last, they gave in the key of the gate to the concierge
Our language, architecture, and our torn up history are an unique combination to us I think
We're the biggest non-Indo-European language on the continent
Ahh, those pastries
I made pasteis de nata once and it was amazing
Definitely gonna make some again soon
No, Hungary has carbonated water too
Sorry
Wait, what
In which way are we different other than the language
Yeah, and we're the only ones going backwards in time
Which building do you think is unique enough
But man, c'mon it's basically cheating if your country has one of the best internet in the world
Parlament
And thats about it
It's listed on the [Gothic revival] page so it's not that original
It's still the largest circus only for clowns, so that's something
The only unique thing about the Parliament is that I can't believe that it's taller than the SOTE tower
Mandatory elkelkáposztásíthatatlanságoskodásaitokért reporting in
Only thing going for them
We didn't invent the style but the building is certainly unique
Romanian does not even has a longest word on this wikipedia page
How sad
DO SOMETHING
Not really (something along the line that you cant make someone to savoy cabagge) just an example how the word length is unlimited in agglutinative languages
[More examples]
Megszentségteleníthetetlen would be a standard, useful word, and it means something which cannot be desecrated
Szótárilag "Megszentségtelenít". (In a dictionary)
No worries, Japanese suffers even shorter longest words
Just imagine that the finns can do the german and the hungarian tricks
That's lethal

It’s about pee, poo voodoo dolls and stabbing haters with knitting needles
My mother knows this fucking woman
Worse yet, through her kid
This fucking creature has a child
My life was happier one minute ago when I wasn't yet aware of this thing

Jožin z bažin truly is a great song
Is she this insane in real life
No, she really is batshit
I'm 21, being that partner for my bf
We were in the same year in high school and now attend the same university
I am currently living with him in his mother's nest
We have been together for 5 years, I moved in half a year ago (if they shut down everything due to covid, I'd rather be stuck with him than without)
His mom considers me family so there was no issue there
Sexy time works mostly by doing it late at night
On those rare occasions when we have the house for ourselves for more than a day, we might do it earlier
Definitely do it less often than we would if it was just the two of us, but we can make do
We have our own room in the house
I'd say that most people in the country are ok with their adult kids bringing home people as long as they act sensible (keeping the volume down, not making a mess, using protection etc
i'm 18 and all my friends are and it wasn't ever an issue
everybody has boy/girlfriends, they bring them home and have sex, we all go to uni but still live with parents
idk if i should say despite or because we all have pretty solid family background
as long as you have your own room with a door that can be shut, parents who respect that and you commit to not being loud, it's all good
Something has to be said about bit having walls made out of paper
And ofc
the lack of religious nutjobbery with the "my house aint no brothel
" is also likely playing a part
&#x200B;
If you think about it the US nuclear family model is the "new/less natural" of the two
As for the WAST majority of history extended families tended to live together, if for nothign else, then for practicality
If you haave some urgent or unexpected thing to do you can ask granny to keep an eye on the kids
Similarly if granny needs babysitting due to being reaaaaaly old, well, its much easier if she lives with you
I would say that the US model is the result of its religious nonsense, and its 'Murican dream hybridizing - so instead of religious idiocy calming down, the solution became "find your own house".
or take a bike
We have "Himnusz" (means Anthem)
It's really sad, and slow, so if a non-hungarian would hear it they'd say it's boring
Or more like that we are in a great depression of some sorts, which is false
It really sounds like something they would play at a funeral
I really like that it's not like a victory march or such like other countries' anthems
We actually are sad, our history and our future is rather dark, we don't have very much to hope for
You should add that it was written in the beginning of the 19th century (by Ferenc Kölcsey); but its style is even intentionally older to avoid censorship, so that Habsburg officials couldn't say it was complaining about the contemporary system
And also the music of Béni Egressy tries to mirror that
It was made to sound like that after the world war
It sounded a bit more upbeat before that
I have always thought that “Szózat” would be a better anthem, because it has a very nice tune and also the lyrics are more patriotic
But aren't we depressed
5% of us are, the highest in Europe
Yeah, but that's not the offical anthem
There you go:
Unfortunately Kölcsey did really good marketing by literally naming his writing "Anthem". So changing to "Szózat" would be weird, I think
Well, you got me there, but our anthem is still way too sad for us
Szózat - Magyarország nemzeti himnusza
It might be weird at first glance but we would get used to it over time
The anthem was made by the older ones, they were depressed
I think
We only have one, the Himnusz
Szózat is like Nemzeti Dal: they're important writing in Hungarian history, but not anthem
I think because we lost almost all of our precious lands filled with several minerals, our country was controlled by another countries , and we lost all our wars serveral times before
At least this is what all the boomers tall about
Ja bocs, azt hittem komolyan mondod :)

Deep frying at home is a mistake
Same thing in Hungary
It should be nokedliszaggató  a dumpling maker, likely to be found in neighbouring countries, too; or the box for milk that came in plastic sacks
and let's not forget the match boxes filled with beads/pearls
had it, used it, quite practical, not easy to clean
I bought a Belgian-made deep fryer half a year ago
It's ridiculous how much better it is compared to the large international brands you can get everywhere, even though it looks totally flimsy
My fried foods consumption has pretty mich tripled, lol
It not the same as far as I know
My mum works in Austria and she always takes some with herself after visiting
It's either not the same quality or there isn't that much place where you can find the original abroad
kocsi, it means car but sounds childish compared to autó
I noticed that Hungarian colleagues use "the" in front of nouns more often when taking about software
Example: "I opened the Outlook" instead of "I opened Outlook".
Funny, because the Slavic languages (Czech-Slovak and Croatian) I more or less know (not speak
) don't even have (definite) articles
That word order exists in other languages, too, actually - "piros nagy labda" sounds really weird in Hungarian, it should always be "nagy piros labda".
(It's the exact same example as yours)
From a linguistic standpoint, it is present tense
Present perfect actually
"I have worked here for 2 years
" is the correct way
It is in the present tense but in a perfect aspect
Grammatical tense, mood and aspect are all different
Look it up if you want to
That sentence was more readable and understandable than it would have been without commas
You gotta admit that makes no fucking sense
If it's fifty pounds, why isn't it fifty quids
I heard it enough from Englishmen that I don't make this mistake but it still makes no sense
To err is human
You mean like they talk like teenagers
"I was like huh and then he was like duuh"
If it's any consolation, you would put an article there if you were to say the same sentence in Hungarian
It generally is free
But some combinations sound better than others
It's not incorrect in either English or Hungarian to say "red big ball". It just sounds odd
Similarly, you can say "főztem ebédet neked" and it's absolutely correct - but most Hungarians, in most contexts, would say, "főztem neked ebédet" (it means I've cooked lunch for you)
I usually say when asked that the word order is free, but has significance
Just like you said about Finnish- how interesting
I would use the first one like here:
- Which big ball you need
- The red big ball
I don't think that this makes learning Hungarian or Finnish easier
Understandable
It's not a very useful language to learn anyway
Even in Serbia
German is harder and doesn't make any sense
No surprise
"Deciding".
Careful with that word

Core part of our cousine from everyday dishes to holiday food
We use it for sweet pastries and poppy pasta
I was actually mind blown when I realised that opium comes from poppy
Why on earth you would put it on pasta is still beyond me
The childhood scars are still on me
>The fields are guarded by military police tho
Seems a tad bit extreme
Here plenty of grannies grow it in theior own backyard, so that they can make the perfect bejgli pastry for christmas
But it's soo good
You just need to add some baracklekvár to it and then it's uwu
...why did it scar you
Alkaloida Zrt
at Tiszavasvári is/used to be a major producer of pharmaceutical morphine derivatives and had significant controlled plantations
Memories of awful food in the school canteen
Use the recipe with the most heavy cream in the dough and the one that proofs the rolls overnight, in the cold
Add a dash of lemon (including the zest) to the poppy, and raisins too, if you like them
The weight of the individual rolls should be around 50/50 dough/filling ratio, otherwise they will rip lengthwise
Pozsonyi kifli is the same pastry, if you'd like some extra work
...i agree with you on that
However mákos tészta was one of the few things they couldn't reliably fuck up, the worst they could do was to barely give any poppy seed with it - which ofc
they did

It's _uborkaszezon_ in Hungary, the exact same expression
Do you have any language games like Pig Latin in your language
I show you two examples from Hungarian to see what I'm asking about
- "Bird language". If you speak this language, you have to put into every original syllable a letter "v" and then repeat the original vowel
Example:
"Tudsz így beszélni
" - in Bird Language: "Tuvudsz ívígy beveszévélnivi
"Can you speak like this
" - in Bird Language: "Cavan youvou speaveak livike thivis
- "Eszperente". Name comes from Esperanto, in this case you must speak with normal words which mean anything (so no gibberish or made up words), but they mustn't contain any vowel other than "e". This shows how over-represented the letter "e" is in Hungarian, because you couldn't do this with any other vowel
Foreigners often say who don't speak Hungarian that it sounds like a goat bleating to them
Example from wikipedia (I didn't want to find out something new): _Étterem - Kellemetes hely, melyben kedvedre ehetsz eleget, ellenben e nevezetes helyen teljes keresetedet elverheted
_ ("Restaurant - A pleasant place where you can eat all you want, but you may spend all your income at this place at once
That just sounds like drunk Dutch
We also have similar
_Fenn a falon, fenn a falon van egy kicsi bolha_
_Fenn a falon, fenn a falon van egy kicsi bolha_
_Nézd a kicsi bolhát, hogy járja a polkát!_
_Fenn a falon, fenn a falon van egy kicsi bolha
(Up on the wall, up on the wall, there's a little flea 2x Look at the little flea how it dances the polka (flea (bolha) rhymes to polka); up on the wall, up on the wall there's a little flea)
And you have to sing this song similarly, with one vowel at a time, like _Fönn ö fölön, fönn ö fölön vön ögy köcsö bölhö_ etc
Btw, now I realised where our word _patak_ for brook comes from
Do people often speak Welsh in everyday life
I like these universal cultural constants
Like I thought only our family kept the sewing kit in a Danish butter cookies box
Dawas iwist sewehr äwähnliwich zuwur uwunsewerewen Vowogewelsprawachewe
Look the replies, a Czech person posted this song's Czech version
Playing games, having fun
And I think children who play this would have a better language intelligence, maybe they could learn foreign languages more easily
But that's just my theory
"Bet" like alef-bet-gimel-etc
And I thought Dana International was the first Eurovision winner from Israel
Either give Matthias Rex a legitimate heir, or let Franz Ferdinand survive
Make them subsidize the price of Subway and Starbucks better
They are sold almost for the american price over here which is ridiculous
The event: Trianon
Reason:   B   I   G    Hungary
A typical Hungarian would say the treaty of trianon that gave 2/3 of the country’s territories to other countries, but what I think is that 40 years of socialism
It held us back for decades and it really changed the way we think(not in a good wat)
This is easy
Delete the treaty of Trianon or if thats impossible, i would make it a fair treaty
So transylvania and all the other land where Hungarians live would be not detached
Im pretty sure everything east of germany-austria was occupied by the Red Army
Similiarly to the others, Czechoszlovakia didnt have real choice in 1945-1948
When did that happen
Lol we beat your ass in 2016(no offense)
Same bro, same :/
Would not have been occupied/torn in three for 150 years

We have [betyárs] 18th-19th century outlaws whose existence stemmed from the social and economic upheaval of post-Ottoman wars Hungary
We also have the horse-herdmen, the [csikós] And our literal cowboys, the cattle-herdsmen [gulyás] after whom the food Goulash got its name
[Hajdú] also has a bit of a different meaning than in South Slavic countries where it’s also used as Hajduk
It was originally used for part-time marauders, part-time soldiers for hire that gained prominence in the Turkish wars
But in the early 17th century the princes of Transylvania settled them around Debrecen, giving them special privileges and autonomy
So hajdú is also a name of Hungarian sub-ethnic group
By the 18th-19th centuries hajdú also became the name for a sort of feudal police
They are seen as kind of “reverse-sheriffs”. Not the righteous guns of justice, but the cruel enforcers of the nobility’s likes and wishes
And last but not least, there are the [kuruc] the anti-Habsburg insurgents of the 17th-18th centuries
Halo, Salut
Ah yes, the historical inspiration for Guts, the main character of Berserk
it originated from Hungary, and I came here to post the same thing
Hajdú was the Hungarian name for cattle herders
i thought of the same thing
maybe even 'kuruc'?
This was an awesome summary, köszi
hajdús were also literal cowboys, they were gunned cattle-herdsmen
Same in Hungarian, we also have ‘hajdú’s, and it’s also a last name in Hungary, quite a frequent one at that
I don't think most people here know much about it
It's probably mentioned in passing in history class, but that's it
Hungary lost the Vojvodina, a part of Slovenia, southern slovakia,carpathian ruthenia, Northern Transylvania
And the local communist party cheated in the elections with the assist of the soviet occupation forces (example the communist party members had a card wich they could vote 6 times) the communist party won the elections with maybe 32 % and Mátyás Rákosi was the leader of the Hungarian Socialist Republic
Ghana was a colony of the united kingdom
Being happy from the Netherlands
Normal political life
Also a government that isn't fucking you in the ass at every chance
There are tree planing programs going on, but they seem to be either local-government run or volunteer
For example, the 10,000 Trees for Budapest program, but that's city-run
It started in 2016 and is supposed to be finished this year with the planned 10,000
I haven't heard of anything nationwide, but we do need more trees
There’s [Unicum] it has a very particular, almost medicinal taste (well it is a digestif)
Some people love it, some hate it
I never really liked it that much to begin with, and since a few unfortunate experiences I can’t stand it
[Pálinka] is a popularly homebrewed fruit brandy
I’m not necessarily the biggest fan, but there’s a huge range of quality regarding it
It can go from undrinkable bleach to amazing fruity spirit
Since they legalized large-scale home distillation there are ton of random people who make not so good produce and like to force everyone to taste it
[St
Hubertus] is a bit of a “Hungarian Jägermeister copy”. It’s lower-quality, but has a taste generally considered somewhat more pleasant than Jäger (I think
I haven’t tasted in a long-time, so I don’t recall it that much
Other Hungarian users feel free to correct me)
Pálinka
Sometimes tastes like bleach
But it also can taste nice
In Hungary it has to be Pálinka, its like Vodka, but Pálinka
In Slovakia i dont really know
Palinka
Tastes like the fruit it's made out of if made well, and if not
it's probably closer to dirt
Ours is Pálinka, which is a very strong, fruity drink
I think gin tonic is great
Specifically everyone has an uncle, husband, friend or father who makes pálinka and it's (at least according to them) the best
There are also 8M other Hungarians who have a different supplier and obviously theirs is best
Safe to say it's mostly undrinkable swill, but spend enough time here and you'll find someone's that you like and be indoctrinated into the 'well yeah, it can be quite bad, but you should try Csaba'a...' crowd
I used to drink Hubertus in my youth (like 18-20 yo), and sometime the cheaper substitute _Vadászkeserű_ ("Hunters' bitter liqueur")
Whenever I remember the taste, I almost throw up
It comes in many more variants, basically from every fruit or plant you can make jam, you can make pálinka as well
But it's not our national drink
It's Pálinka
A lekvárból is Pálinkát!
tbh the home made is good,at least the one i usually drink
I know lol, i was just saying that i like gin tonic
A nickname I heard for Unicum is "gömbkóla" (spherical cola) specifically because of the bottle
Aren't you supposed to drink it like vodka
Either you are, or I'm drinking vodka the wrong way
Ah, I see
The problem is it's been a long time since I've drunk good pálinka
I think its pretty easy compared to other languages like German and French
The only difficult thing is that you hear a lot of different English arround you
So, take me for example: i speak a British-american mixed English with either an american or an eastern-european accent
Also, i make the mistake many times to use Hungarian grammatical rules when speaking English because it sounds better imo
So, its easy to learn good enough so people can understand you, but you may make a lot of mistakes
I don't think so
My spoken English is terrible, mostly because I basically never use it, but I consume all of my media in English
Also, I never search for anything that is not specific to Hungary in Hungarian
So basically, I use it daily
I make lots of mistakes (especially using he/him instead of she/her, since gendered pronouns are not a thing in Hungarian), but when I read/hear/write English, I don't translate to/from Hungarian in my head, I just think in English, and I achieved that point without formally studying it
I took a few classes in university (1
5-3 hours a week for about 30 weeks total through multiple semesters) to practice actually speaking a bit, because here in Hungary you must have an intermediate or higher level language exam to get your diploma (I think you need 2 now), but by then, I knew enough to don't actually learn anytihing new and just used the classes as practice
German on the other hand
I studied it in elementary and highschool, for I believe a total of 9 years
In highschool I had something like 7-8 German classes a week
I even had to pass a German exam at the end of highschool (equivalent to the American SAT's I guess), which was marked just below an A, which in turn would have given me an intermediate language exam in German
That was about 10 years ago
Nowadays I don't speak a word in German
Granted, I hated it and I didn't put in any effort outside of sitting in on classes and studying for specific tests
I don't know why, English just made sense to me and I learned it by trying to communicate in online games, then watching TV series with Hungarian subtitles
Then after a while I got good enough and impatient enough to not wait for Hungarian subtitles to be released and switched to English subtitles
Nowadays I still use english subtitles when watching series/movies, but honestly, I have no idea why, since I listen to plenty of podcasts and watch a fair amount of youtube without any trouble
It's just a habit at this point
I actually prefer English to Hungarian, which, if I didn't learn naturally due to being born here, I wouldn't even touch with a ten foot pole
So in short, no, I don't think English is hard at all
At least not on the every day, conversational level
Nah
Compared to my primary language it is a piece of cake
Even if your teachers are bad you can still teach yourself english just by consuming huge ammounts of Media in English
"Yeah, I am totally interested in the culture and I definitely don't just want an easy way to get an EU passport so I can go to tourist locations in Western Europe hassle-free
You're not an empire for a while now
Being eligible is one thing but I wish people didn't pretend to give a shit about us when they clearly don't. We have at least one such person asking this same question on r/hungary each week
Just hit up the Hungarian embassy and get it done there, fuck
It's exhausting to contend with these people
>but many of us have problems with gypsies' actions and lifestyle, not their ethnicity
Plenty of racists in the US would say the same thing about black people
That's a debatable statement, both the explicit and implicit part of it
Gypsies in our neck of the woods in Central/Eastern Europe aren't "travellers" as they are seen in Western Europe
They are generally poor(er) people living in the shittier parts of cities and countries, having lots of children
Nothing unique about that
English - Hungarian
Vienna - Bécs
Munich - München
Bratislava - Pozsony
Cologne - Köln
Warszawa - Varsó
Cluj-Napoca - Kolozsvár
Leipzig - Lipcse
Not Europe:
Beijing - Peking
Most cities within old Hungary but outside current Hungary have distinct Hungarian names, which vastly differ from the names used in modern English
An easy example is Pozsony - Bratislava
On another note, Vienna is also called differently here
It's Bécs
Edit: Another notable example is Venice - Velence
Bratislava is Pozsony (that is probably because the english name came after the hungarian)
It would be a more amusing question for German names as historically Central-Europe had a bigger German population
Like Fünfkirchen is not really similar to Pécs
Or the Slovak town Poprad amusingly called Deutschendorf
Budapest to begin with
Letter s in Hungarian always sounds "sh" so the right pronunciation would be "budapesht".
Knowing what pest means in English the wrong pronunciation just gives extra fuel to the joke line of being asked if you are hungry when claiming what country are you from
This happened to me in England and well, not the expected English politeness to be honest
Vienna=Bécs
And most cities in the neighboring countries
Bratislava - Pozsony
Trnava - Nagyszombat
Nové Zámky - Érsekújvár
Vienna - Bécs
Novi Sad - Újvidék
Rijeka - Fiume
Zadar - Zára
Cologne - Köln
Dresden - Drezda
Nice - Nizza
Saint Petersburg - Szentpétervár (though it's a literal translation)
Rostov-on-Don - Don menti Rosztov
Venice - Velence (we also have a town called Velence in Hungary, so it can be confusing)
Florence - Firenze
Naples - Nápoly
Brussels - Brüsszel
And many Russian city names are Magyarized, as the following:
Nizhny Novgorod - Nyizsnyij Novgorod
Krasnoyarsk - Krasznojarszk
Novosibirsk - Novoszibirszk
Bryansk - Brjanszk
Vladivostok - Vlagyivosztok
Vyazma - Vjazma
Vienna / Bècs , this is the only one that really ckmes to mind
>Kodaň - Copenhagen
why
In Hungarian it's the same thing, we call it Bécs
I quickly looked it up on wikipedia to find its ethimology and this is what I got:
>Körmendi Ferenc szerint a város magyar neve avar eredetű: becs jelentése őrzőhely
[3] Kiss Lajos szerint az ómagyar „bécs” (szénégető kemence) szóból származik, ami a maga részéről egy régi török nyelvű, azonos jelentésű szó átvétele volt
[4]
So basically it means either "guarded place" or "coal burning furnace" and it has an Avar or a Turkic root
Same for us
Hungary - Magyarország
And
Florence - Firenze
Wrocław's Hungarian name is Boroszló, which comes from the German variant obviously, but even weirder as Hungarian tends to insert vowels
>But everyone does get very creative with their pronunciations of Ljubljana
Can't go wrong with Laibach
And what is Latvia
And Banat
And even the rest of Romania
(We have a unique Hungarian name for most Romanian cities
Iaşi - Jászvásár
Roman - Románvásár
Yeah the hungarian language is pretty weird
The regions where Bratislava and Cluj-Napoca are, used to be the part of Hungary so Pozsony and Kolozsvár is understandable
München and Köln were adapted from the time when Habsburgs ruled Hungary I guess
About why Vienna is called Bécs I have no idea though
Yes, Pressburg, Pozsony and Bratislava are names for the same city
yeah okay, but Copenhagen ist a bit further away
Hungary, Ungarn, Hongrie, Hungria, etc
all come from the Latin word Ungrii, which is how we were called when we came to Europe
We on the other hand, call ourselves Magyar, while ország means country, so Magyarország literally means country of the Hungarians
As per Wikipedia, it's either Avar or Turkish in origin
One of our comrades also mentions it above, and if I remember correctly Serbian and Croatian use a word with the same origin
Which, now that I think of it, is just one language
Edit: Peking used to be used in other languages too, but at some point, the Chinese government asked people to please start referring to the city properly
Similarly to how Ivory Coast is now  Côte d'Ivoire
Makes sense
Only Google Maps and Waze, as far as I know
There's iGo Navigation, but that's mostly just built into cars
Some of my hiker friends use a special map app that can display elevation and hiking trails, but I forgot its name
[mapy
cz] is actually awesome for hiking, I have used it several times too
That's two continents worth of people though, way too broad of a demonym to use anyway
Like if there was a country called Eurasia, would I care if only they were called Eurasians, even though I'm from the continent of Eurasia
Of course not, I still have European, Eastern European, etc
just as you still have Latin American, Central American and whatnot
They were the first ones to be called that, and are the most prominent country in the Americas, so it's fairly reasonable to call them Americans
1 huf doesn't really exist, 10 huf can buy you a small candy (smallest ever), and 100 huf is two eggs
1 liter of milk costs around 200 huf
1 Forint: nothing, even our smallest value coin is 5F
10 Forint: nothing
100 Forint: like 2 boxes of matches
At around ~300 you could get a bar of chocolate
1 forint = nothing
10 forint = a paper bag
100 forint = 2 bottle of water
We cannot buy anything for 1 or 10 HUF
The cheapest thing I can think of is a bun, which you can get for 20 HUF
100 HUF - a cheap bottle of water
1 HUF ≈ 0
3 Euro cents
1 forint coin doesn't exist anymore
10 forint means nearly nothing
100 forint is enough for a round in a public toilet or a shopping cart
Sport szelet, Balaton
Small sour candies cost around 10 Ft
Why'd you want to buy weed
Just go to the side of the road eks dee
For me, it's the other way around, it's so easy to spend so much of my money in euro, because you know, 20-40 euro doesn't seem like it's much, it's only in the tens you know
Then I do the math in my head and holy shit, I'm surprised half of the time
200 + ÁFA
It's a quite old currency, the '90s weren't too kind with it, neither is the current government
He didnt mean that cheaper meat is sketchy
He meant thatvthe price is for stuff like free range chickens, ethical farming ...etc
basically 1 step above "its meat" kind of meat, in terms of taste, but still well under luxury meats
I mean 0
3 (3/10) cents, 0
003 Euros
> ÁFA
VAT, for anyone wondering
It was in 1946, the largest denomination was [one hundred million bilpengő]  it is 10^20 pengős
And after that fiasco forint was introduced as a currency, with some gold backing
> I visited Hungary in 1983 and I remember an official exchange rate of something like 15 HUF = 1 NLG
Yeah government really screwed up in the 90s. They couldn't figure out how capitalism worked other than "sell every asset of the state for pennies = good". Crazy inflation is one of the side effects of their amazing work
The government is profiteering from inflation, and wages around 500€ (or much less) would be noticeably low, there would be international and national consequences for not raising them
Always cursive, and most teachers even punish those who write in printed in elementary
In highschool, this is less pronounced though
We didnt learn it in Hungary
They taught us cursive only in elementary school, and never printed letters
We learned cursive but now I'm writing printed
Why tf would you write in printed letters
Sure, if I had to write by hand often, I'd prefer cursive too
That said, I don't find that being able to write really fast with my hands is a useful skill at all
Not in this digital age
To answer the question, we not only learned how to write in cursive, it was required
In elementary and highschool, if you didn't write your paper with cursive, they automatically failed you, regardless of the subject
Back then, laptops were a very rare thing (as in, not a thing at all for personal use at home), most of my classmates didn't even had a PC or Internet at home, and smartphones or tablets (or smart boards in school) weren't a thing at all though, so it made sense
Everything was written on paper
Circumstances change though
Right now, I think it's a waste of time
To be fair, I thought the vast majority of school material was a waste of time, from elementary school up to my CS degree
As for cursive specifically, most people won't really write anything on paper in their day to day life, and when they do, it's usually just filling out forms with basic information
I'd prefer those to be easily readable
What are the most common scams that can threaten tourists in your country
In Hungary, Budapest we have the following things:
\- People blocking the public transportation ticket machine inside with a sticker
Once you have left they go back to take your returning coins/tickets or passes, which they sell for other tourists
Never buy tickets from strangers on the street
\- The well known "Romanian deaf mafia". They can't speak Hungarian but they pretend like they can't speak any other languages as well until you call the police
They usually put a turtle toy in front of you in restaurants/trains, then come back a few minutes later to collect the money from generous people
\- Some girls in the 7th district are in contract with pubs
They are trying to seduce you, to make you invite them for a drink, so the place can charge you for an incredibly overpriced drink
\- People coming to you to ask you to sign something which will help them protect someone
(usually ill children) After you sign, they ask you how much would you like to donate
It's also a scam, feel free to ask for their license
\- Edit: Taxi drivers as well, as written in the comments
Taxi drivers should be at the top of your list
Never trust them, use an app if necessary to show you the shortest route to your destination
But then I'm apparently not allowed to brew my own either
Please stop this ageism, it's their youthful spirit that counts in this line of business
Never had a serious encounter with pickpockets in Italy while in Barcelona there was a menacing amount of them (and these were just the ones I could spot)
I ended up very visibly carrying a cheap wallet as decoy with minimal cash while the rest and the credit card were in a money belt
Well yeah as for tourists the travel insurance with unlimited coverage costs like 10-20% more so it would be a foolish thing not to go for it
They start demanding money after they have tightly wrapped it around your wrist
ima just stick to my fish sticks when it comes to seafood
I find it disgusting, but becouse of how intelligent octopuses are
The idea is disturbing in the same way, as killing and eating an other human
As a Hungarian, I have only eaten octopus once, when I was on vacation in Greece
All I can say is I'm not a fan
But I don't think of it as weird or anything
I also don't freak out over people eating dogs and cats
What makes dogs, octopuses and cows different
Nothing, one culture eats one, other culture eats the other
I believe most Hungarians wouldn't even try it, very unusual, I personally would try it
Hungarian here
I love octopus salad, but would eat it in any form
Absolutely amazing
Borsod (Borsod Abaúj-Zemplén county) = Mordor
The whole country tbh
For extra fun, it's usually abbreviated as "BAZ megye" (megye=county), which sounds really close to "bazmeg" - "fuck you".
Borsod a sorsod
(Borsod is your destiny)
Az sorsod Borsod te kulturálatlan
I lived there for 4 years so I guess the question in my case is if I would return or not
I probably wouldn't because of my son
Don't get me wrong, as a healthy, middle / upper middle class dual-earner couple without kids NY was great
There are tons of amazing restaurants, museums, exhibitions, it was easy to visit other parts of the US and the Caribbean etc
I liked my job, I was employed by a non-profit so we weren't working ourselves to death by American standards and my colleagues were fantastic
I found Americans really easy to befriend and I still keep in touch with 6-7 of them
However, when my wife became pregnant we looked into giving birth and raising a child in the US and we immediately decided to move back to Europe
Our priorities changed and the whole system became way less attractive: the healthcare system sucks even with a good insurance (not the treatment itself but the constant haggling with the hospital and the insurance company), schools were often either insanely expensive or bad, buying good quality food ingredients was often an effort, Manhattan has a great public transportation system IF you don't have stroller with you, employers don't give you enough holidays, etc
etc
So for the next 18-21 years I can see ourselves moving around in Europe but not to the US
Doesnt matter, i beleive they would turn me back at the border because i am an atheist
A lot of European countries are different in Hungarian
For example: Lengyelország - Poland, Németország - Germany, Olaszország - Italy, Oroszország - Russia, Horvátország - Croatia, Magyarország - Hungary
Croatia-Horvátország
> Netherlands -> Hollandia, also formerly: Németalföld (German Plain)
It's more like the closest we have to the expression _Low Countries_. Btw, Németalföld isn't necessarily the modern Netherlands
> Fun fact there is no ország(country) in country names outside of Europe
I haven't realized this until now
Wow
Well, Törökország has a small portion in Europe
Hungarians also use -ia suffix for countries:
Demark-Dánia
Norway-Norvégia
Portugal-Portugália
England-Anglia
Scotland-Skócia
You're right
Österreich —> Ostern reich —> “east” reich
So eastern empire, provinces
Lithuania- Litvánia
There's a second hand clothes shop, that's called "TÚRVAJÓ" ("best if found"-ish), which is just one letter away from "KURVA JÓ" ("Fucking great")
Needless to say, it gets CONSTANTLY corrected for the latter
This has spawned a lot of content and articles too
The [Nemzeti dal] titled quite literally 'National song'. It was written by Sándor Petőfi  for the revolution of 1848
He is considered one of the biggest poems in the history of Hungary
There's a street named after him in almost every town
It was also the first poem I ever memorized in kindergarten
>in kindergarten
I'm sorry, what
The things I memorized in kindergarten were about little cute animals, nature and childish games
Or to write something more comparable to the Divine Comedy, I would say either János Vitéz or Toldi are more fitting answers for this question
i wish i could say i disagree
it's kinda lame that this is basically national anthem no
2, there's so much variety in hungarian poetry yet these are the ones that everyone knows by heart
also add 'Alföld' to this list
Yep, me too, but I learnt the first verse of this one too
Walesi Bárdok
Bro, we got one of our kings killed by a boar
We all have a fear of boars in Hungary
Haha
and a side for duck and geese aswell
*Német-római Birodalom* (German-Roman Empire) or *Német-római Császárság* (German-Roman “Emperordom/Kaiserdom”)
Archaically *Szent Római Birodalom* (lit
Holy Roman Empire) also exists, but not really used anymore
Német-Római Birodalom/Császárság
German-Roman Empire
Both Birodalom and Császárság mean Empire, and both can be used when referring to the HRE
The most common way to refer to it is "German-Roman Empire"(Német-Római Birodalom), but very rarely you can find the "Holy Roman Empire"(Szent Római Birodalom) version too
[ we had it for German scientific words because they didn't exist in Hungarian (and to make the language fancier)
English doesn't see the same thing
:) We just try to write the words we can with Hungarian phonetics
However, we have a lot of loanwords from Slavic, Turkic, Persian languages, and we don't hate them, they've been in the language for very long time
(some over 1000 years)
Sadly not, as far as I know, but I would like to have one
how did they come up with those words
>Removal of loanwords has actually been fairly successful in Korean in the past
A lot of Japanese loanwords were incorporated into Korean during Japanese occupation
Same in Hungarian, except for ones from German
Indeed it is
But so is the word for school (iskola), axe (balta, Turkish), eggplant (padlizsán, Turkish)
Many words concerning buildings come from German, and kept their original form, like lichthof, speiz, etc
In the 18-19th century there was a movement to invent new words either to replace loanwords or just have something for a new invention
Tanár (teacher) is tanítás+árasztó (someone who flows knowledge), mozdony (train engine) is something that moves, rovar=rovátkolt barom is an animal that has a cuts on its back
Most people probably wouldn't notice now that these are invented words
There were also many unsuccessful tries that were ridiculed at the time, like foltos nyakorján (spotted neck-thingy, giraffe), and words that were used at a time but died out, like éleny (life-thingy, oxygen), or villámdelejes forgany (lightning-magical rotating thingy, electric engine)
Even though I'm already at quite an advanced level of English, one thing I still mix up in my speech sometimes is the gender of personal pronouns
Referring to a man as "she" and vice versa has gotten me into some awkward situations
The cause is simple; in Hungarian, personal pronouns are not gendered, it is just "ő" (and its conjugated forms, of course)
Also, hate to be that guy, but uh
with English being your native tongue, looks like you also mix up some words, since in the title, it is not "who's" but "whose". :P
Viktor Orbán. :(
No joke:
The t-shirt says: "living god".
It reminds me the old Hofi joke: "What's the difference between Orbán and God
God doesn't want to be Viktor Orbán
My favorite recent(?) meme is when she was waiting for god to create the universe
Well yes, unfortunately, this proportion is >50% in Hungary
And how much they love each other
Like from Bolsonaro through Orbán to Duterte
We've been lacking of luck for ten years
The Mary-cult had a strong tradition in Hungary too
Partially, the reason for it was the prior existence of a paganic mother-figure deity
The two characters eventually merged in folk culture, thus parts of the old beliefs survived in the form of the worship of Mary
It really isn't. More like ~20-30%, which is still a lot, but not that bad as you wrote
Didn't she direct one of the episodes in Planet Earth 2
Sorry, I count the indifferent als supporter, too, because they are the backbone of the regime
Who never vote, who say "I don't care, all politicians are bad" etc
They are as important, as the fidesz-zombies
> Even many of their voters have objections but have even more objections against the alternative
Well, they are then worse than the original zombies, because they pretend to have a brain, but they don't.
"So YoU lOvE gYuRcSáNy
ReMeMbEr ThE nOkIa BoXeS
44négy" is their counter-argument if somebody confronts them
Well said
Yeah, I'm the harmful one
This is like when Fidesz-média weeps that the fascist Karácsony also governs the city as a dictator in the state of danger
Brühühü, after 10 years of fidesz, this is what Zoltán Lomniczi and Gábor G. Fodor are sad for
> ensuring that tribalism
Well yeah
They told me that I'm the traitor of the nation so many times, that I have believed it
I don't consider myself in the same nation as the vast majority of the Hungarians
I know that Orbán will reign here until his death, and I reserve my right to resent all the people supporting this
Some hungarians still think they are superiour to others
Labant Csaba refused his son's K-vitamin vaccine
The kid vomited, like, really hard
A nurse tried to respirate him, but the father and his wife tried to stop her, because they said, they can't respirate a not even one year old child
The kid died
Labant Csaba got arrested by murder, I guess
On the court it turned out he's a flat earther as well
That was around a year ago, and he still in trial
He tried to blame anyone
The nurse, the police, the hospital
He said, they wanted his kid for his ORGANS
Also, he's the dangerous idiot
Hungary has too many
The main flat earther once was went to the Hungarian Academy to presentation
He said everyone was interested and liked this theory
He was on the Pschihology department
I mean, we lost Transylvania in WW1, people are still salty
There's also the Partium
And the genocide against/expulsion of Hungarians after WW2
Slovakia was always more alien and Croatia was never officially part of Hungary, just the crown
Transylvania on the other hand is a deeply respected and historically rich region wich has been a part of Greater Hungary since the time of the Árpád's.
Croatia was a separate state that *mysteriously* \- wink-wink, nudge-nudge - happened to be governed by Hungary since the 12th century
No significant Hungarian population was ceded and the new border generally followed historical borders, therefore there is (and was) no hostility
They also came to realize rather quickly that the Great Union of South Slavic Peoples belongs to those ideas that are much nicer in theory than in practice, so there's a justified 'we told you so' feeling on our side
Those are, too, but they are the most salty over Transylvania
Yea and there are people on the internet who thinks the treaty expires in 2020
The Vojvodina one during 1944/45
Yes, absolutely
And don't even try to ask for advice on, say, r/legaladvice or r/personalfinance of you aren't American
No point
When I posted in r/legaladvice they literally couldn't help me because I'm from Hungary
> it's totally normal in the US to regularly go to church even if you're otherwise normal
Otherwise normal :D I love that phrasing, can relate entirely
And seriously, what is it with their obsession with pop culture
Incredibly exhausting
I'll take Americacentrism for 200 please
There is one
Its called r/carsEU
It was originally to make ourselves a separate thread but it didnt really got big
Share it and we can make a nice little thread there
But you do have the highest rates of teenage pregnancy among developed countries, even if it's decreasing
I understand and agree with all that but still, dozens and dozens of comments consisting of nothing but pop-culture quotes that add nothing to the actual discussion
incredibly frustrating and it happens in pretty much every 'light-hearted' reddit thread
A lot of Americans seem to have the idea that culture = race
Their idea of diversity is very much racially charged and a lot of them cannot seem to handle the idea that a Hungarian is very different to an Englishman, or that Romania and Sweden are quite different places with different history and culture
They say “many languages means many different people”. And that is true I believe
When speaking English, I somehow obey a very “American” way of saying stuff (thanks to all the influence by the internet and pop culture)
Hungarian only uses intonation on entire sentences (for example to indicate a question or an exclamation) while English uses it word-by-word
I also feel more modest when speaking French, and my voice pitch is higher
Same
I have a very deep voice but my English is straight up girly
I can relate to this
I have an easier time to talk about feelings or form opinion in English too
My English personality is much less reserved lol
My best friend (Same native language) and I almost exclusively text in English- we picked up this habit because it was much easier to talk about certain things that way, and it continued to be a habit
Sometimes i wish more friends of mine would be willing to do something similar, id have a much easier time to open up, but oh well
Nah, when I speak Hungarian I have to open it more
Nah, Hungarian is one of the most openly articulated languages out there
I start slurring my speech more when I'm speaking English
I don't know how to put it, but I feel we have more 'rounded' or 'open' wovels
I dunno about the throat thing
We use hard R, no TH, no W and the word-stress is always on the first syllable of a word
Manual labour can pay better then a job that requires education
For instance, my current boss told me that in Budapest assisting labourers won't even consider the job below 15 000 HUF per day (~43 EUR)
That comes our to around 330 000 HUF per month (~938 EUR), or even higher depending on what the deal is
Not bad for someting that you don't even need any formal education to do, let alone a degree
Gas man
(Hungary) you can earn literally billions
I wish I was joking
On average people take home around 200 000 - 250 000 HUF (~596 - 710 EUR) depending on where they live, iirc
Hey, that 9,35€/h is not that bad
In Hungary you can find people to work for as low as 1,5-2€/h.
Depends where you go really
For instance there are places in Budapest where you can get a beer for what amounts to about 1 or less then 1 EUR and some other places where it's 3 EUR
Ofc I have no idea what places you visted exactly but those frequented by tourists, such as most of the central disticts are usually more expensive
But yeah, all in all, the wages are pretty low around here sadly
There is a reason Hungarians call London the second biggest Hungarian city
Budapest: modern, annoying people, too much gypsys
Miskolc: incest, crime, cool buildings
Debrecen: nice church, modern
Eger: nice wine, old buildings
Pécs: huge university
those are the ones off of the top of my head
A balkan EU extension, more countries joining schengen and  the eurozone
East and west's development differences will be hardly seen
Investing in lesser developed nations in the world
And i hope we will be the greatest vanguard of peace
Yes im optimistic
Well I'm not British but I live here for 7 years now so to my understanding, old people tend to view it in a positive way while young people don't really care about it
People moved around a lot in the last few centuries so it's a bad indicator, but any family name ending with in -i or -y denotes their place of origin
-i  for commonfolk and -y for nobility
Győri (someone from the city of Győr), Szilágyi (someone from the county of Szilágy), etc
Names like these are quite common
Old, localized ethnic groups also work
Tóth (someone from today's Slovakia), Palóc (a group of people in Nógrád county), Székely (a group of people in Transylvania), and so forth
Not sure if this is the answer you're looking for, but I don't think there are other telltale signs in Hungarian that someone is from a certain location
if you meet someone with the surname Hugyecz, he/she is most likely from Nógrád county or Vác district of Pest county
If a meet someone with that name I start to laugh bc the name sounds funny as fuck
Can I tell you a funny story
I live in Germany now but need to go back to Hungary for a weekend soon
The govt there closed the border for foreigners and expats but with many exceptions
I do not belong to any of those exceptions and plan only to visit very short, but even then I should go straight to a 2 weeks quarantine which I can shorten with 2 negative tests taken 48 hours apart
That´s way too long a complicated to me so I do the following:
I land on an airport close to the border and call a guy I know, who does a border commute every day and has Hungarian plates
He picks me up at the airport and smuggels me into Hungary
He says I should look like a worker who just finished his shift and it´ll be fine
Pretty fucking hilarious
Just like in the 1950´s, but the other way around
To answer you question: yes I still plan to go back to Hungary for good
Yeah, we got those people in Hungary as well
"If you don't like it here, then leave
\*person leaves\*
"Oh you left, you traitor
Don't ever come back here
You are not Hungarian anymore
Echmiadzin is not only a beautiful place but the center of the Armenian Church, really worth a visit, it´s quite extraorinary
ik ga je pijpen
Ich spritze dose maximum
I heard this once from a Hungarian stand up comedian, like it was yesterday
Before you ask: Yes, it's from an old smuggled VHS from the DDR

Well I imagine one of them is english
Happy cake day
Who would have expected something like this
The trains, and the buildings
We're still using some of the things the communists built, and it's kind of sad, but nostalgic at the same time
Also the classrooms of schools in the countryside
They're still using those dark green wooden blackboards
[Tatra KT8D5 trams]
When I was a kid, these trams were used in my hometown, but since 2014 they were replaced with Škoda trams, and most of the old Tatras were sold in Prague, only a few remained which run seasonally
This, combined with the Tatra trams is the ultimate nostalgia trip for me
We used this as the goal when playing football :D
That's great
As far as I'm concerned Corona isn't even an issue in North Korea, right
No it didn't so it was kind of an extra line of defense, but I remember that once, while trying to save a goal, the ball hit my hand and knocked it onto the bottom bar and it broke my thumb
How do you commemorate WW2
We don't and didn't use the "Czech Republic" form except official documents
It was always "Csehország" (Czechland, the country of czechs)
There is no word in Hungarian for "Czechia", like "Csehia" or something
In hungarian we call it Csehország ( Czech Country) instead of Cseh köztársaság (Czech Republic)
The last one sounds way too offical and Csehország takes less time to say or write
If I speak English I'd say Czechia (if I knew how to pronounce it)
Czech Republic is again, just too long and sounds too offical to fit a normal conversation
In Slovakia we are used to "Česká republika" I never even heard "Čechia", in hungarian its "Csehország"
Oh, yes that is also an option
[This is] the right answer
Our most unique flag for sure
I really like the simple red-white squared croat pattern
Simple, recognizable and relatively unique
Those uncreative bastards
The thing you said about the crown
OMG do you like it too
That crown is just awesome
In hungary there are no dialects
Only Székely People(Hungarian minority) in Romania or Hungarians in felföld (Slovakia) speak a different a bit different than others
Correct me if Im wrong
Hungarian dialects are almost the same, and today "standard Hungarian" is mostly spoken
Hungarians across the border are still having stronger dialects
The only Hungarian dialect that is very, very different is Northern Moldavian Csángó, but not to many people speaking it anymore
Budapest - everything
Debrecen - agriculture, pharma, (automotive)
Szeged - food
Miskolc, Győr - machinery, automotive
Székesfehérvár - tech, electronics
Dunaújváros - metallurgy
Despite the fact that a Hungarian, Karikó Katalin is the vice president of BioNTech, we still mostly call it Pfizer-vaccine lol
pfizer
and they also mention katalin karikó a lot since she's hungarian and played a pretty big role in developing the vaccines
Köszönöm.

Hungarian, English, German, French, Croatian (meaning probably a few others as well
), Spanish, Slovak (not sure about the spelling of the last one)
> Koszonom (I think at least two 'o's had umlauts)
Actually, all three: Köszönöm.
Here I am
Wanna talk
:-D
No, thank you is "köszönöm". However, Merci can be a nickname for someone called Mercédesz or slang for the car Mercedes (mercis - someone with a Mercedes car)
We also have the chocolate brand Merci
Their Formula 1 track
Captain Jack Sparrow
Nothing bruh
I made a presentation about Sweden in High School and we had to speak firs about some broad facts than dwell into an important industry/agricultural/service industry branch of the country
First I wanted to do IKEA, but I read during the preparation for the broader facts part that Sweden has very high iron quality and I fell into that hole
I pretty enjoyed reading about the history and future of this industry, even though I had to do the presentation in German
The most important Hungarian artifact (for around the past 800+ years) is the Holy Crown of Hungary, there is a whole lore and an almost religion-cult like following of  that crown
It's scary, funny and for some reason I can understand it
Just look at it
They's fabulous, they's... They's... Beutyfull
They's **precious
We also call them frankfurti
We have a kings too
1000 FT - Matthias the Just, you probably heard about him, he was co-king of Bohemia after the "Hussite king"'s death
10000 FT - Saint Stephan or for reformed church people Stephan I. Well kinda the most important guy in all of Hungarian history
He created the County System that is still standing in Hungary
In Transdanubia the county borders didn't even change that much, what I find really really interesting
We also had Carl I on the 200 Ft note, but the paper money was changed to coin
He was replaced by a bridge with chains
We too
Why would we do that
We are already raking in [all the medals in men's water polo] and [most of canoeing too]
It would be [teqball] for Hungary
It was created a few years ago so noone else really plays it
Teqball but only because we invented it
:) Also close second would be making "moonshine" or pálinka:)
You guys have no chance
You'd have some fierce competition there
>Swearing
As if you would stand a chance
How about hobbyhorseing
Combine the two and create a new sport
I heard about the guy who's legally dead
No taxes tho
Oh, us Hungarians are notorious complainers as well, we're in
You're asking the wrong questions
Can you be arrested for murder if you're legally dead
In hungary we have "magyar kétfarkú kutya párt "
Which means "hungarian two-tailed dog party" (raw translation) and it started as a joke but they now have a few representatives in the council
the hungarian two tailed dog party
actually less weird than the gov
party
We have this party called Fidesz, it's led by a little known guy called Viktor Orbán. It's pretty weird and also real sadly
Fun facts about them include a fondness for stealing and a disdain for democracy
Years ago Hungary wanted to organize the 2024 olympics and they said If the game took place in Budapest They would import ancient greek ruins
They also want to marilize legajuana
This:  . When the national television gratiously offered five minutes for all other parties to introduce their program, they appeared in a chicken suit clucking
Later it turned out he was clucking their main program (infinite life, free beer) in Morse and ASCII code
Campaigning for free beer and immortality
More than two-thirds of them, so they can do pretty much whatever they want
It wouldn't help at all
Russia has a bicameral legislature and Putin still wields all the influence
It's pretty much the same here, Orbán emulates Putin in a lot of way
Hard to say
By European standards, I guess the UK is big already, but by world standards, the only big countries in Europe are France, Ukraine and ofcourse Russia
In terms of population and size, I's say Romania
Never even heard from them
I usually take trains in Austria and they do have them, it's pretty great actually
I don't know about Hungary though, probably not
Budapest
I just love it, it's so different from every other bigger Hungarian city
Székesfehérvár, basically it is a very old city where most of our kings were crowned and burried, it has a beauiful architecture, culture and history
My city
Every other city can suck dick
Especially in futball
I mean I like basically every city in Transylvania
It has a unique feeling to it, that I don't experience anywhere else
Not even in Hungary
The Steiger beer factory actually operates there, isn't it
Hungarian meme culture is very cool over at r/FostTalicska
100% prefer it over international, we even have quite a lot of our own meme templates
Hungary
It mostly consists of making fun of people who are not the smartest, people with a different dialect, or just generally different than others and so on
Writing English words phonetically seems to be hilarious
We like to make fun of ourselves
But mostly they just translate already famous ones from English and use it as their own
Oh and they can get very political, but thats not just Hungary
Overall it's not bad, kinda funny sometimes
Rich
Well, it's different here in Hungary
We have our own things, most of which are very different from english memes, but the community is generally very creative
We have our own terms (basically just literally translating every word from english) like 'én_avé' meaning 'me_irl' and so on
The memes are very funny, mostly politics related in some way, but i love it
And the community is pretty big, considering most people haven't even heard about reddit in Hungary
But in other ways, we do kinda resemble the English meme culture, in a way that we repeat the same jokes over and over, there are very cringeworthy "memes" as well
We aren't proud those, obviously
So, yes, i like it in general
I wont even talk about instagram meme "creators", because they just steal from r/Fosttalicska (respect to the exceptions, of course)
We got r/fosttalicska which is quite a dank sub
Sub name literally means diarrhea wheelbarrow
rendben, csecsemőrobbantó
+pirosarany
szóval mindegy, én elkezdtem robbantgatni
Town in the rural regions of Hungary
As a joke we use it as an Alabama replacement
As an advanced physics student at the time, visiting the nuclear power plant and its museum was one interesting trip
Also one of the guys in my year managed to break the simulator of how to change the graphite (?)
Another one has to be the time we went to Recsk as advanced history students
It's a labor camp from the early '50s, holding political prisoners
We've been there in early March and the weather was absolutely terrible — mud and near freezing which still probably was a fraction of the horrible things the prisoners endured
These were half a day trips/just a couple hours but I went to caves twice
The kind where you need to wear overalls and hard hats not the walk-in kind of easy access ones and it was so much fun, we still bring them up sometimes
And it was a three day trip but since it was scheduled past the school year (instead of mid-May), only 10 out of 35 went to my first high school trip so we just chilled at an aqua park after a bit of hiking + rowboats and a visit to an easy access cave
And then the next day we went to explore the city (we've been at a farm thing) but it was raining so my friend and I just went to a shopping mall, directed there on phone by her stepfather who used to live there
We got a 4 years lasting catchphrase from that trip, lol
We went to a wildlife park and there was a huge ass  zipline
Others were SUPER lame
The only nuclear power plant of the country was exciting
2nd best was the local confectionery factory where we could eat anything we wanted
But that wasn't a regular school trip, the owner's son was our classmate
We had sex ed first in 5th grade with an outside professional (but as I heard it, this is quite unusual)
And then we had our regular sex ed in 6th and 8th grade at biology class
Depends on whether or not you're attractive
Same, 5th grade by the district's doctor
We are friends with poles, not that outlandish, but unusual
As I know they are basically Jewish jokes
During the communist era, right after WW2 making fun of Jewish people was prohibited, for these types of jokes you could have gotten a sentence to death
So we changed Jewish people to Scottish people because they are far away, we don't know anything about them, and we have no problems with them
> despite being on the opposite sides of the war, our countries were still friendly towards each other
Supplying the Warsaw uprising by repeatedly ordering our troops to charge at the Polish forces only to retreat, leaving our equipment behind for the rebels to use must've been a hilarious yet wholesome maneuver to partake in
Another thing happened in WW2, that Germans wanted to use Hungarian railways in the invasion of Poland, but the goverment didn't allow that, because of our friendship
And Poles also contributed to the revolution of 1956, because it started as a solidarity protest to the Poles
In Europe yes, but our closest relatives are the Mansis and Khantis
It's only my opinion, but I think it's really sad that we don't know much about our language relatives, and we don't really care about them
Even, you can also find Hungarians, who deny the fact, that Hungarian is Uralic language, and there are a lot of alternative theories about which are the relatives of Hungarian language
It's actually Khanty and Mansi that are the most closely related
I'm half Hungarian half Romanian, but I've only ever lived in Hungary, and I only speak Hungarian
So I obviously feel a stronger connection to Hungary
We'd be more than happy to have you in /r/hungary, you can write your comments in English that's no biggie and having another perspective is always welcome
It's a pro EU echo chamber, but sometimes peeps go too far regarding the grass being always greener on the other side
Yes, mainly Harghita and Covasna counties, as well as Cluj-Napoca, Oradea and Braşov
Yes
Very different
The way they say E /ɛ/ sounds a lot like Á /aː/ and they have a whole bunch of unique words we don't know
Their pronunciation doesn't make it harder to understand them, their unique vocabulary does
But then again, there are more dialects in Hungary, however, it's really hard to tell where somewhere is from based on their pronunciation alone
(Except for Szeged, which has an infamous dialect)
In Szeged for example, instead of E /ɛ/ many say Ö /ø/.
~~accidentally not inviting the hungarain embassy as a negotiating partner to the treaty of trianon~~
When in 1896 the Austrians introduced weighted universal male suffrage, the traditional balance of power in the Reichsrat ceased to exist
When Count von Badeni, Austrian PM tried to appeal to the Young Czech Party to gain their support in a coalition, he introduced a language reform in the administration of Bohemia and Moravia
This reform made both German and Czech the administrative language in all of these two crownlands, which enraged the mostly monolingual German population
Thus began an era of parliementary disfuctionism in Austria
Why did it matter
Well, the fact, that the Austrian Reichsrat could barely pass any legislative decisions in this time period made it rather difficult to pass the new decennial economic and financial agreements with Hungary
The result of this was the so called Ischl Clause, bywhich Hungary onesidedly lengthened the current deal
The problem with this was, that now the Hungarian parliement was in disarray, since they viewed the decision as a surrender of the country's rights
Heavy obstructionism began, which made the parliement unable to accept the annual budget for 1902 in time
This resulted in riots in Croatia, among other problems
When the then Hungarian PM, Tisza István forcefully broke down the opposition's obstructions, it created a controversy so great, that in the next election the Anti-Ausgleich Hungarian nationalist united opposition won
There's still more to this story, but things more or less settled only after 1908
To conclude:
-Relations with the Austrians suffered
-Relations with the nationalities suffered
-Meanwhile the military budget stagnated
And the Great War was right around the corner
Nah but fr i cant really think of anything rn
Thank you for helping out my sleepy brain that cant think of anything
I've learned that English speaking people never ever respond with just one word
Responding with just yes or no is very rude, you have to say something like "yes, I am", "no, it's not".
Also, that Fraulein is very commonly used in the German language
I had to learn a lot of devices people don't use anymore (or use very rarely) and names of places don't existing anymore (and sometimes I didn't even know what they were)
It's been same with English and Russian
I started learning Russian last September
In my Russian book, characters sometimes still go to disco, using CDs and DVDs (and never heard about pendrive or cloud) and altough they sometimes write e-mails, they still write handwritten letters and postcards
I  also remember, in English class, we had a text about the characters going to video library (honestly, I don't remember the correct name, but it's the place where you can borrow videos) and none of my classmates knew what it is
It was around the mid 2010s. Another thing with English, we were taught about "be going to" and we were made to use it very often
Later, I realized, "be going to" is not very commonly said, only when someone wants to emphasize something
Otherwise present countinous, "will", or "gonna" are used
Lucky you, we had to learn half a page about a winter Olympics or some other sports event (I can't remember) in Garmisch-Partenkirchen
>Responding with just yes or no is very rude, you have to say something like "yes, I am", "no, it's not".
I remember that, too
We've also learnt it that way
My memories came back, when we had to cram stupid texts in French
Not texts and phrases we might have used in the future, not
We had to learn by heart a story about a couple having a first date and the man propose the women, meaningless dialogs (and talking to ourselves) and things like that
I'm so thankful I finished high school and I don't have to suffer in French class anymore
Of course, I get it
It also identifies women by their marital status, which is also a bit outdated, especially if you don't have the same word for men
What I meant was that in every high school German language book it was used way too frequently, and it gave the impression that it's a super common word even today
I was a high schooler 10-15 years ago, maybe today they moved on and updated them
We have the same in Hungarian (probably originating from Austria):
- asszony = Frau
- kisasszony = Fräulein (literally: "little Frau")
I like the Hungarian names of neighbouring countries' cities way better usually than their version of it
Idk why, I guess it reminds me that those places were once part of Hungarian history, so they shouldn't be lost
Pozsony - Bratislava, Nagyvárad - Oradea, Temesvár - Timisoara, Szabadka - Subotica, etc
I might get hate for it, but I prefer those versions
"vár" is castle in those names
I like the Hungarian names very much
As far as I know, no current Hungarian city has an English name
My hometown szombathely translates to Saturday place
Trá mhór is such a pretty place . Love to visit it again .
I agree
They are usually just mimicking the Hungarian pronunciation or translating the meaning literally
(Of course, there are exceptions
The German name for the city doesn't come from war dein (was yours) it comes from the Hungarian word, várad
The nagy part in the Hungarian name means big (Nagyvárad)
Most of our Hungarian Great Plains (creative naming i know), there are many small villages it that region with the population of <100
If you ask someone from Budapest, anywhere that isn't Budapest
And even Dublin feels like that from here
If you don't need it, why did you take it away from us
(joking)
[Actually, the plains generally have larger settlements with bigger space in between than the hilly areas]
Especially the Neusiedlersee
Hmmm good to know I am from this area so I was generally biassed
Also I think "middle of nowhere" isn't just how big it is but also its relevance
In which case Békéscsaba wins, there's nothing there and even bearly
This is a little misleading, since there used to be a large "tanyavilág" ("hamlet world") at some places like around Kecskemét which weren't consisted of incorporated settlements but still very much inhabited
Hey, more respect for the Viharsarok please
Don't diss my hometown
^((that I don't plan returning to)
It's the second most peaceful city in the county
Right after Békés.
This is the joke that only Hungarians get
Hey I love there, I have right to talk shit about my home village (which I spend about 4 days a month)
No, only Csaba is peaceful there
Impossible

Ofcourse they go in the fridge
It keeps them edible and drinkable way longer
It is expected, they will almost always ask you if you want them to wrap it up for you
Its uncommon due to portion sizes at most places
However noone cares, you already paid for if, so if you want to take it with you, well its yours, do with it as you please

The only place where i could see people caring is snobs in high end fine dining places, who go there with the goal of falunting wealth, as opposed to enjoying the food, but other than them its not something tbat anyone would remember
Not at all
Maybe some top-level places, but in most restaurants it's absolutely OK to take home the leftovers, although they might have a small fee for the packaging
There are some places that are proud of their enormous portions, where it's even kinda expected that you don't eat it all

Lol, we do that in Hungary as well
Unless it's a very formal, stuck-up situation we blow it as hard as it goes
In Hungary we've had a "this doesn't make sense" moment for 1021 years now, and we're perfectly fine with it
Brother is a lil based ngl
Why does he do it though
Yeah, they tried that shit here in Hungary too
It wasn't long lived
It was reverted after a year or so
First of all, it's ridiculous to begin with if you think about it even for a minute
The monday-friday workweek is not really a thing anymore
Also, it reduces the total hours of operation by a significant amount, which will end up hurting the employees either by causing them to work less hours and get paid less or work the same amount of hours which leads to stores being overstaffed and people losing their jobs
Absolutely fucking moronic
Secondly, everyone started abusing the rule
All of the employees of smaller stores ended up being part-owners of the stores
Only on paper of course
Poor brother
&#x200B;
Do you get something like prius if you go to jail to sit your debt
Jesus
That sounds like a nightmare situation
Pushed the country into civil war, then offered most of the country to the Ottoman Sultan on a silver plate
It's also speculated, that he was intentionally late to the battle, where the previous king died
I'm talking about Szapolyai János aka John Zápolya
The party compiled a list of the poorest people and at elections they send out people to give them a dozen eggs and a bag of pasta in the name of the party
After that they offer buses to get them to the polling stations
Hungary Is a small country so there aren't many accents and it's very rare that someone speaks in a completely different tone (and if so, it's almost always the older people) - it's rather about the words they use (but just a few words) or the different declination of verbs, nouns
Sometimes people coming from different parts of Hungary can have a very good time playing "do you know the word ....... ?" - but those words are not from everyday life
However the Hungarian living in Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, etc
can have really noticable dialects
I think only the ignorant and poshy ones look down on people who don't speak the "standard" Hungarian, for the most of us it can be interesting, maybe sometimes a bit funny, but not in a mean way
Hungarians who live in the east( Hajdu-Bihar, Szabolcs) or who live in the west (Vas) have pretty noticable accents
Most Romani people also have noticable accents (which I don’t have a problem with but is pretty straightforward) and indeed, Hungarian in surrounding countries is spoken a bit differently
Nobody gives a fuck
Unless you are speaking to yourself, it's not
No, is it a thing in the US
I could not imagine that, sounds like something from a totalitarian regime
Anything that can come close is private investigators who inform the police of the whereabouts of fugitives and collect the reward
They don't have more rights or powers than any civilian
Sort of, they are in theory just debt collectors but for some extra money they will probably do anything, what you ask for
>Bunch of dumbfucks with little to no education who were too stupid to become police officers
Behind the iron courtain police officers were not famous for their intellect
The role was mostly filled by people who wanted to retire early and were too dumb for much else
We even got a saying
*postman,, police officer, railroad worker - stupid, stupider & the most stupid*
That's not exactly how that saying goes: it's "stupid, stupider, stupidest, postman, policeman, railwayman" - it's meant to say that these occupations area higher grade of stupid than what the adjective itself allows to express
Sure, I meant the part that big guys from god-knows-where knock on your door looking for you
Yeah, I realised I used the wrong word
What I meant really is just that idea of big guys knocking on the door to get you what feel a little bit like communist times
>untrained, and occasionally unlicensed individuals arresting criminals for payment from a private company
Take out private company and put in Government financed and there it is a moment from a communist nation
There is just surprisingly little difference between thugs of opressive regimes (like in fascist Italy) knocking on your door, to help out a company that is supported by the state
And ptivats thugs directly paid by companies (instead of "being on good terms" with leaders of the regime) knocking on your door
&#x200B;
I get that the latter is good moral free capitalism, and the othef is evil opression, but if you are on the receiving end its pretty hard to tell thedifference
Yes
...however i fail to see the practical difference between US during the coal wars, and fascist Italy
Sure there were philosophical differences, but at the end of the day striking workers got machine gunned down just the same
there's this food called kőrözött, that is a spicy cottage cheese kinda spread
it is made of túró (which is a type of fresh cheese curd or quark, kinda like bryndza in neighbouring countries, but more sweet), sour cream, onions, caraway seed powder, red paprika powder, black pepper powder and salt
it's definitely worth a try
> tyrokafteri
oh, very interesting
i've found this discussion on the topic
We have 8 World Heritage sites:
* Hollókő, a village in northern Hungary
* Budapest, the capital city
* the cave system in Aggtelek (shared with )
* Pannonhalma Abbey
* Hortobágy National Park in the Great Hungarian Plain
* early Christian necropolis in Pécs
* Lake Fertő/Neusiedl (shared with )
* Tokaj wine region
EDIT: This really doesn't deserve an award
I just looked it up on Wikipedia
All of them worth a visit
It is not just a little village
It is a *traditional* little village
I've been there a couple times and it's actually quite fascinating
*The Old Village of Hollókő is an outstanding example of a deliberately preserved traditional settlement, representative of a culture that has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change
This village, which developed mainly during the 18th and 19th centuries, not only represents the Palócz subgroup within the Hungarian nation but also bears witness, for the whole of Central Europe, to the traditional forms of rural life which were generally abolished by the agricultural revolution in the 20th century
*The property includes the most important elements and components of the village and the surrounding landscape: the deliberately preserved traditional settlement, the farmed land belonging to it, the wider landscape and the natural environment with all its character-shaping elements
The traditional settlement and its landscape environment, shaped by land-use, which includes features such as strip-style farming and wooded pastures, together with the castle ruins that organise and orient the landscape's panorama, form a harmonious and intact entity in its visual appearance
There are two main types of Fisherman's soup (halászlé, sweetwater fish chunks in a paprika and onions flavoured stew): the Szeged and Baja varieties named for two towns on the Tisza and the Danube respectively
The Szeged variety contains finely crushed small fish parts and bones mixed into the soup as well which makes it creamier, and is eaten with large chunks of bread
The Baja variety doesn't contain the small parts
They also cook a special type of pasta for it in a different pan in water, then serve first the soup with the pasta in it, then as a second dish the soup with the fish chunks in it
A terrible overcomplication of the perfect Szeged variety
So, what is the correct answer
I prefer sweetened (only make/buy milk based and not the plant stuff)
Then I raise you the superior one, Gesztenyés (chestnut)
Wait, there are people who use warm milk for their cereals
How is *that* acceptable in the first place
Also, it's not that big of a debate but whether sausage from Csaba or Gyula (manufacturing cities) is better
We have that dish, too
Meat's the best part
Anything, i hate people calling us hungry
Anything that they can't make "hungry" jokes about
*please stop*
Danubia, perhaps
Or Pannonia
Magyaria doesn't sound that bad
I'd go with writing it as something like Magharia or Magaria, or best of all Madyaria, which is how it should be written if good ol' Kazinczy didn't mess up that one too
> *Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of Saint Stephen*
I never heard/read someone from Hungary adding that "of Saint Stephen" bit
Did we ever actually use it
In Hungarian, Turkey is called _Törökország_ which is literally Turkland
"Po" in German means butt
Hungaria sounds pretty cool to me
I have a cool name for your country in mind, but I'm not sure you would like it
By any chance, did your great grandfather perhaps have Hungarian roots
Viktor with "k" is a very common name here
László isn’t a gypsy name by origin
It comes from the name of King Ladislaus I.
Although I have met plenty of gypsies names László...
László is a gypsy name
I'm pretty sure it ain't, and I've met a lot of László's in my life
I think its more like we rather wear clothes with subtle logos
Also Norway
I wouldn't say I had "romantic" views, but I was quite shocked to find such conservative people (Free Church people)
I did not expect to be judged for "living with a man outside marriage" (friend, not even boyfriend)
I know they're a small minority and I certainly don't judge the whole country by them, but I didn't think such beliefs existed in Europe north of about Greece
Also did not expect so much sexism in Finland
I hope those types are also a small minority

Man, i'm jealous
The train line that goes to Budapest through my city is one of the most used, and it was last upgraded (or repaired, i'm not sure) in the 1970s. The line is 60km, and it has a 40km/h restriction on most of it
With stops and other delays (wich we get a shit load of, thanks MÁV) the ride from one end (Lajosmizse) to the other (BP) is 2 hours
But hey, at least we have tons of football stadiums
My friend called them "Free Church" in English
I forgot the proper Norwegian name and now I can't find it, but my friend said it was *not* the main Norwegian Lutheran Church, and also that most people don't give a shit
No worries, it wasn't ruined, just made a little bit
weird
I met lots of nice people, the land is absolutely gorgeous, and fiskegrateng is excellent
In Norway, it was just bad luck
The man I lived with, long-time Norway resident, firmly assured me that the vast majority of Norwegians don’t care about who lives with whom (male, female, straight, gay, whatever), and it’s just the ultra-conservative Free Church people who care
That’s a small group
I mentioned this another time on Reddit and a Norwegian lady replied, saying please don’t judge Norway by them because they’re extremists
In Finland, yeah, Finnish women have told me the same thing
It’s a type I haven’t experienced elsewhere
And I was probably romanticizing the Nordics as a place with no sexism or homophobia
> Where in Norway were you
Right
It's completely WTF
I was in Oslo staying with a friend
Apparently the building he lived in had a lot of Free Church residents
Of course, they knew we were living together
He was just there because the rent was cheap
I would think
It's fairly normal most places I've been (which is mostly Eastern Europe)
I met them in real life, in Olso
I was staying with a friend who lived there and apparently the building he lived in had a lot of Free Church residents
Of course, they knew we were living together
He was just there because the rent was cheap
Geographically
I've only spent time in Central and Northern Finland
Otherwise, I'm over 40 and so are most people I know, so maybe it's mostly an "older man" problem
As for what countries are more or less sexist, there seem to be different types of of sexism
I’m used to men who think housework and cooking are for women or who make jokes about “women drivers”, but still respect us and don’t *really* think we’re less intelligent
And I'm probably blind to that kind
In Finland, it seems men agree housework isn't gendered, but *some* men also seem to think women are generally less competent at life, can't manage a household on their own, etc
That's really strange to me, so I notice it more than the "he never does housework" type
Doesn't that make an average European guy more well-versed in what's considered good than a British bloke
I mean if you have some perspective, you can compare the 2 things, while British people can't.
I think it was
I just wasn't sure because I looked up that term and didn't find anything specific (but I don't speak Norwegian, so that's probably why
Thanks
Fortunately it was mostly just a bad surprise
They didn't harass us or anything, so we just ignored them
Good to hear that it's not so common among younger people
Hopefully it's fading out
I've visited other Nordic countries, but mostly I've been in Eastern Europe (mostly south-east of Hungary) and the Middle East
I suppose it's mainly the *type* of sexism I've seen in Finland that's...unsettling
Wow, I found something on Wikipedia:
This is basically a list of surnames
Also available for other languages, replace "Polish" with chosen ethnicity
Hungarian surnames:
* job: e.g. Kovács (Smith), Szabó (Tailor), Halász (Fisher)
* ethnicity: e.g. Német(h) (German), Tót(h) (Slovak), Horvát(h) (Croatian) - the ones with h are the traditional spellings, also more common
* origin: place name + i
* given names as surnames
More info: [ Feel free to ask if you need help
Also, if a name ends with -i, it usually refers to a place
For example Budai is a common first name and it means "from Buda"
Oh right, how could I have forgotten - one of my surnames is a physical characteristic
:-D
Some more here:
Yeah, there are quite a lot of Slavic words in Hungarian, and vice versa
Also, not on the list, but I know "papucs" is the same in Croatian
No, my own country scares me
If you are not content, and have an opinion the dogs of the fidesz will cry for your blood
Literally
Austria: No, not really, as they are neutral
But, I would actually be happy if they annexed Hungary lol
Slovenia: It's not that powerful, so, no
Croatia: Just a little bit
I couldn't see them going to war but, if they did, they would probably win againts Hungary
Serbia: Thankfully, our relationship is better now, than it was in the rest of our history but, if they went to war, they would probably win
Romania: Many hungarians are still really salty over Transylvania, which is really dumb
I think Romania is a pretty neat country, and it's good to see them growing so quickly
And, that's why they could easily defeat us
Way bigger economy, population
But, i couldn't see them going to war
Ukraine: Same as Romania
Slovakia: Both of our militaries are pretty pathetic, so not that threatening
Well, the Hungarian nationalists want "big Hungary" back, but I mean, we deserved Trianon, plus there is only a small minority "stuck" outside of Hungary
The Hungarians are in minority everywhere, even in Transylvania
So no, I'd rather be afraid of my own country than to be from anybody else
Hungarians are just so stupid
We're coming for that Zakarpattia >:)
Just wait till the Fire Nation attacks
I would say that the Hungarian people are the same as always, our government though
well I don't even know what to say anymore
The overwhelming majority of Hungarians have a very favourable look on Austrians
I came here to say this
>Hungary is the one that most openly talks about its irredentism (wishes to annex parts of neigbor states that were once part of Hungary)
I don't know, maybe I'm overreacting but Orban scares me a bit
Ngl it's not that severe, don't worry we're not gonna hurt you little one
**F E A R   U S**
> de facto control over our port
Excuse me
It was about an administration house built NEXT to the current port, which gives no control or anything
The house will build up next to Trieste anyway, which is not as close as Koper which is unfortunate for Hungarian exporting companies
&#x200B;
> wishes to annex parts of neigbor states that were once part of Hungary
This is what nationalist foreign politicians say to gain some voters
You will never ever find a single Hungarian politian party over 1% saying they support anything like that
Wow this is the first time I hear of this
If this is true, Orban and his cronies have been extremely quiet about this
Which is very uncharacteristic of them
Don't worry, we're weak as fuck
Slightly
It burns like an oil well
There are three types of people in Hungary
Belives in Orbán (Majority of the elderly, and adults) (They vote for him, because they were here when we lived under russian influence
And to be honest it is still better than back then)
Wants to change the prime minister and the political arrangement of the country
The people ( myself included) who just want to go away as far as I can from this political disaster
Whaaaat  A year ago or so the last independent (-ish) journals were full with the story
"vote" damn i wish election still was a real thing and wasn't done for show
Trianon is irreversible
Slovakia has a better economy than us
> The truth is we never excelled at anything
Maybe not the case recently with all the political divide, but you used to be pretty good at sticking together to push a common goal
We on the other hand tend to cannibalize ourselves for momentary gains
Like, I've read about a castle held by Royal (Habsburg) Hungary that the Ottomans sieged many times but couldn't take
Then East-Hungary attacked and sacked the castle, after which the Ottomans eventually took it
Good job us
basically our history in a nutshell
This mindset exists in Hungary as well, about the great hungarian stuffs, that great hungarians developed
The truth is that they almost never did it in Hungary
But we like to think that we fart the warm summer winds
As a European I lived in the middle East and was travelling around the wider Arab world including the Maghreb and the Levant
Some parts of the Maghreb very much resembles Europe/Southern Europe mostly in architecture - Casablanca, Tunisia, Lebanon
I also went to Carthage and it was pretty thrilling to see that heritage
I see a clear connection with North Africa, but probably it is more apparent to the French due to the language
Turkey and the Near East is actually closer to this part of Europe
To actually answer the question though, my knowledge is quite limited, but I did read a bit about its history
The Exarchate of Africa, the Ottoman-Spanish struggle over the region in the 16th century, the Barbary Wars, the French expansion in the 19-20th centuries, the Algerian War and the Algerian Civil War
These are the few things that suddenly come to mind
I would say the settlement of Hungary
Around 1000 when christianity was being spread and there were still nomadic pagan horse archers
I think it could make for an interesting story going back to the old games and the christians being the bad guys and it could have twists in the story where our first king Stephen I realizes that for them to be able to survive they have to convert
The 150 year long Ottoman occupation of a third of the Kingdom of Hungary in the 16th to 17th centuries
The northern third, ie
about present-day Slovakia was dominated by the Habsburgs, while the eastern third, Transylvania was trying to manouvre between the two big neighbouring empires
Lots of battles, constant raids into each others territories by light cavalry and infantry (the birth of the hussars), religious differences
Its easy, when the ottoman empire invaded Hungary, actually i think that would be a very interesting game
Yeah, this is a great idea
I like that
that would be epic
You mean Csák Máté?
You Germans have an interesting take on fun
me neither, i feel you
but my comment tried to be funny
it didn't got through
well that's true, i understand that
i didn't mean any harm, i want to clarify this
Yes it has
As I wrote it before here somewhere, there was a publicity stunt of a major commercial tv that they announced in like november they wouldn't air _Home Alone_ that year; and it caused a huge uproar (part of which was constructed by that channel, but part of it was genuine), so they "backed out" (probably this was the plan)
Then the slogan arose: "No Christmas without Kevin
But since then, it isn't a big deal anymore, I don't know if they're going to air it this year
EDIT: Oh yeah, I realized, they are going to air it in the main slot of Christmas Eve
_Die Hard_ didn't became a tradition, even if it was very successful in Hungary as well
_Love Actually_ in the other hand is aired every year around Christmas
For me personally, the ultimate christmas movie is _The Exam_. It's a Hungarian thriller from 2011, it's set on Christmas Eve 1957, one year after the 1956 revolution
It's about an officer of the secret police whose loyality was supposed to be tested (like everybody else's, so they're not traitors who supported the revolution)
It's pretty important that is set on Christmas Eve, it has a very good and heavy atmosphere
English subtitled trailer:
EDIT:
20-30 years ago, in my childhood, two movies (more precisely: miniseries) were traditionally aired around christmas: _Gone with the Wind_ and _Sissi_.
really just the gypsies who dress in adidas
not much else

In Hungary, despite it being a socialist country at the time the popular music in the 70s and 80s had a lot of western influence
In the 60s and 70s the most popular genre was classic rock and beat, the most popular bands were Illés and Omega
Towards the end of the 70s and in the 80s punk and new-wave got popular, but they couldn't get that big because of political reasons
In cultural politics Hungary was a bit more liberal than other socialist countries
Every artist (not just musicians but painters, poets etc
) belonged to one of the following three categories: Supported, Tolerated, Prohibited
So which artists were popular really depended on the government's approval
Fun fact: one of the most famous Omega song was sampled by Kanye West on Yeezus
The song Gyöngyhajú lány was sampled in the song New slaves without the band's permission so the composers sued Kanye and in the end they settled it out of court
None at all
If spoken slowly I seem to catch a few very basic simple words in Khanty and Mansi
Written nothing at all, they use Cyrillic, and even with Latin it's mostly unidentifiable
Apart from those nothing at all in the whole Ural-Altaic group
Edit: in fact I can catch more from Indo-European languages I don't speak with the help of my Hungarian knowledge beside English
Hungarians can't understand basically any Uralic language neither spoken nor written
Hümm, I'm a lover of Uralic languages, so I might be able to add more languages into the mix
Mansi/Khanty languages: A Hungarian speaker with a bit of knowledge of basic sound changes will understand a couple of words from a sentence, most likely verbs or other elements of speech that are a part of a language's core vocabulary
Udmurt, Komi, Mari (&Mordvinic): Grammar will seem awfully familiar, and a shared layer of Turkic loanwords will help too
Still, in order to actually understand something one must have some sort of knowledge about Uralic linguistics
The Samic and Finnic branch: Absolutely nothing, unless you studied them
Although most Hungarians report a "sense of familiarity".
In a nutshell: nothing really, unless you know a bit about uralic/finno-ugric linguistics
Finnish and Estonian: not at all
Mansi and Khanti: some words are similar
There's a video with the numbers in Mansi  which I can mostly understand
But I'm not sure if I could understand someone speaking coherent text in these languages
The language what
More like four thousand years old, actually (sorry, im both a linguistics student and an awful nerd)
We do have a whole bunch of connected words, they just happen to have shifted so far apart they aren't intelligible anymore:
Elävä kala ui veden alla
Eleven hal úszik a víz alatt
Self
Hangings
Cutting someone in quarters, I guess
But it was just one time

No, my country has unionist movements
Transylvania specificly, the southern strip of Slovakia with a hungaian majority, or the complete overturn of the Versailles peace treaty of 1920
Both seven and week are "hét" in Hungarian
It is logical tho
Toy, game=játék
Day, sun=nap
Paradise and Tomato are both ,,Paradicsom''
Same with day and sun, "nap"
Uhu and Eule are specific kinds of owls so they don't count
I am first and foremost hungarian, but I have a strong connection to my county and city, what is rather unusual among hungarians
During the last century local  identities, traditions and dialects almost completetly dissapeared from Hungary
So 95% of Hungarians would connect themselfs first and foremost to their nation
definitely the city
apart from budapest, almost everything is shit in this country
Pesti vagy, vagy vidéki
Why would be thinking about yourself first and foremost as a part of nation rather than somebody from a region be nationalist
Regionalism among hungarians is almost nonexistent, only prevalent among székelys and csángós
Yeah, they are fascinating, especially csángós.
Fighting with my younger brother
During the 80's we only had two TV channels with only boring propaganda programmes mostly and 2-3 VCR tapes that we watched over and over again
Occasionally we played with the neighbor kids and rode bicycles when the weather permitted it
We used to play "pretend shopping" with empty sweet/snack packages; someone played the cashier and someone else played the costumer
We also spent almost every day at the playground and hang out at the abanonded house at the end of the street
"very well", in this particular order
More often than not, my tongue gets tied and I say "wery vell", or almost like "wary well" sometimes
Essentially anything with that weird "th" like in "think". Is it an "s" sound
A "t"? Perhaps "f"?
No, it's an abomination inbetween these three
For some reason I usually have a hard time with "problem"
Don't forget 'very rare'
My Swedish pal says the word "jungle" like "yungle". Love you Anton lmfao
Cultural thing, the UK is a poorer country and has a mentality to fight
Country is the cradle of modern boxing after all
Was always like that, pub fights have been part of the (working class/chav) culture for centuries
North Korea is similar to Hungary
At least that's the only country that uses the same old Hungarian buses (Ikarus) and Czech trams (Tara) like we do in Budapest when there is a problem with air conditioners on newer buses

We use Microsoft teams as well, but it varies day by day how much classes we have
The school has been taking measures to make the teachers hold as much classes as they can (first month we only had like 3 times an entire week, now its about 3 per day on average)
Exam season started this week, in Hungary it's a 1,5 month long nightmare where we don't have classes, only exams, so we don't have online classes anymore
Before this week only one of my classes were held properly by Teams meeting, the other classes were either recorded by the teachers, some of them only made audio files, others tried to make ppts with audio files and some even did video recordings or they just uploaded their ppts
Moodle was the most popular site for this, but some teachers used Canvas and Neptun too
We have to take our online written exams on Moodle this year, I had one this morning and it was pretty weird
(Neptun is a Hungarian site/system, where you can sign up to your classes and exams, teachers can upload files etc
It's not a really student friendly site, so most people don't like it
we use "somtoday" and "teams". somtoday is like a dutch I think platform where you can see  homework and links to websites where you make them and stuff like that
and I dont think I have to explain teams lol (teachers at my school are really tech illiterate and they often give every student admin rights to kick and mute people lol)
The only lesson they kept doing is Math, 3 days a week on the school's Discord server
For homework and assignments, we use Google Classroom, except one teacher who for some reason uses Facebook (though because he can't really see if we do our homework or not, only 2 or 3 people do it)
Zoom or discord for live lissons, google classroom for tasks, redmenta for tests
I have 1 or 2, sometimes 3 online lesson a day, mostly math, chemitry, biology and german
My school has a Discord server, two student runs it as admins
95% of the students and teachers are there
Probably my class started it first with a class Discord with our class' main teacher (idk how they say it in english)
We had only voice chats, but maybe we will do simething with Discord's video mode
We take notes on online classes or copy it from the documents from Google Classroom (or don't make notes at all :])
We also use Teams but there is no online classes we just have tasks
Also our school got a microsoft partnership wich is great because we get all sorts of free stuff (even free computers if someone does not have one) and when there is actual school we even got tablet rooms wich we can use
you should cheer some bits
We have Göd
Well we have Pornóapáti

Yes, only once at December
The funny thing is that there is a village called Széphalom, which gets snow almost every day during winter and it’s about 15 kilometres away from my town
Yes, on the first day of December, but after that, nothing
I was pretty surprised by it, because I haven’t seen a storm like like that in the last last few years
It caused a lot of chaos, but it was kinda magical
By the way I live in Budapest
Sárospatak
Yep, you got it right
Sadly still very popular

The bridge Margit híd (Margaret Bridge) was detonated by the German Army in November 1944
As the Soviet troops were advancing towards Budapest, the German forces placed explosives in all the bridges of Budapest in order to make the transport more difficult to the enemy when it comes to that
Later, all of the bridges were blown up during the siege (which was one of the bloodiest and most terrible city battles of WW2, but not as famous as Leningrad, Stalingrad or Berlin), but the Margaret Bridge was blown up probably accidentally almost two months prior to the siege when everyday life was still ongoing
As you see, cars, pedestrians and also a tram was on the bridge when it happened

Damn
I'm Hungarian and never knew this photo existed
This is shocking
And our GDP wouldn't be the quarter of Austria's if the Soviets had left us, too
Maybe because of Christiaan Barnard who performed the very first heart transplant in the world
Then I guess it's not that iconic as I thought
What I meant is that she looks much older on the photo than 38
How about the average amount of popes per square kilometres

LETS DO IT
Huh, the music video of that was used as an example of video editing by my IT teacher a few years ago
What counts as foreign-born
* Do Álmos and Árpád, the princes who conquered the Carpathian Basin for us and were born outside of it
* Do our countless rulers who were born outside the borders of modern Hungary, but in areas that were part of Hungary, count as foreign-born
Do those count that ruled after the Treaty of Trianon
* Do Hungarians count that were born in another country, or only foreigners born elsewhere
* Does the 400 years of Austrian rule count as an occupation
We can include the following people based on the location of birth:
* Peter Orseolo (1038-41, 1046-59), son of a Venetian doge and the nephew of our first king
* Géza I (1074-77) and his brother László I (1077-95) born in Poland to a Hungarian king and a Polish princess

* Ulászló II (1490-1516), also born in Kraków, nephew of Ulászló I.
* Not listing Habsburg kings, who could be considered occupants
Princes of Transylvania:
* Katalin von Brandenburg (1629-30) born in Königsberg (Kaliningrad), prince of Transylvania, wife of a former prince
Prime Ministers:

Under Soviet occupation:
* Zoltán Tildy (1945-46), born in Lučenec, Slovakia (which was part of Hungary at the time of his birth, but not at the time of his rule)
* Mátyás Rákosi (1952-53), born in Ada, Serbia (which was part of Hungary at the time of his birth, but not at the time of his rule)
Stalinist dictator
* János Kádár (1956-58, 1961-65), born in Rijeka, Croatia (which was part of Hungary at the time of his birth, but not at the time of his rule)
Communist dictator, de facto ruled 1956-88
I'm not sure Habsburgs could be counted as an occupation
They had tyrannical periods for sure, but they became lawful kings at the time
She said, that at the Battle of Waterloo, it was the British, who came to relieve the struggling Prussians, not vice-versa
I asked her if she was sure about that twice, but she kept clinging to her truth
I didn't bother to directly correct her though
She said we are closer to the sun at summer, that's why it is warmer
It was in 2nd grade
Never corrected her, but it was an early realisation that most adults are extremly stupid
> Romania single-handedly helped the Entente win WWI because we joined the war
That statement would be much more appropiate for Italy
Sure, they were the pinnacle of imcompetency, but they still tied down valuable Austro-Hungarian assets and even saved the Serbian Army from annihilation
Without them, things like the Brusilov Offensive wouldn't have been as successful as they were
In such sceniario, the Romanians might have even entered the war on the side of the Central Powers
Wow 100000 people under 30 years is a big increase, especially for a European country
How did they managed that
It's barely over 40,000
Silly me
It's not public holiday, but that's when you are supposed to take down the tree
Probably the two beginning lines from János Arany's Toldi Miklós:
"Ég a napmelegtől a kopár szík sarja,
Tikkadt szöcskenyájak legelésznek rajta
Or probably the first verse of Sándor Petőfi's János vitéz
"Tüzesen süt le a nyári nap sugára
Az ég tetejéről a juhászbojtárra
Fölösleges dolog sütnie oly nagyon,
A juhásznak úgyis nagy melege vagyon
or *Nemzeti Dal* by Sándor Petőfi\*, "Rabok legyünk, vagy szabadok
|Ez a kérdés, válasszatok
"\*.  "Shall we be slaves
Shall we be free

Answer me
" Romantic poem calling for Hungarians to unite and break free from the Austrian Empire
Most people probably forget about József Attila after school, but this probably stays
Other than the anthem and the national poem, Its probably that:
"Talpra magyar hív a haza"
For not Hungarians: it's the first line of the Nemzeti Dal (National Song), the rest of the poem is well known too
Translation: "on your foot Hungarian, the nation is calling"
Written by Petőfi Sándor
That's fucked up
Is that a true story
Szerintem József Attilának kicsit jobban sikerült rátapintania a néplélekre
Do you happen to know the Hungarian movie _Bibliothéque Pascal_?
The 75 % of it is in Romanian (like 20 % is in English, 5 % or less is in Hungarian)
Surprisingly, it's not at all about Trianon or Székelys, more like it's a tale about a typical Eastern European fate told in magical realism
It's totally a Hungarian production with some very fine Romanian actors
I very much recommend it:
In Hungary, we don't really either
I mean it's a topic for a certain, small and loud circle, most people don't really think about it
As I said, this movie isn't about it, it could be set in Hungary, Slovakia, Poland as well
But I think Romania is a good choice, because of its semi-exotic, superstition-prone atmosphere
never call a hungarian "hungry", half the time we would give you death stares or insult you, except you cant understand what we are saying so its even worse, not to mention everyone swears like its no tomorrow
>2 more vowels than English
Any reason to point that out specifically
Can confirm
Does "Hollandia" gets a pass
It's not "Holland" afterall
In Hungary, relatively speaking I think IKEA is expensive, at least people around me had this perception
I think it’s on par with the competition but cheap, I wouldn’t call it cheap (considering the average income)
In Denmark, people seem to look down on Ikea but they have good quality and they are affordable (compared to income)
I don’t get the people who pride themselves not having anything to do with Ikea, it seems a bit pretentious when they buy a designer stool for DKK 2000
Strange how different countries look at the same company
IKEA is an expensive furniture shop, but if you want NEW and stylish furniture with really high quality you have to go there
IKEA food isn't really known or talked about in Hungary, maybe the mustard
I agree with you very much
I was looking forward to it, and it was a total disappointment
It's not that bad, but what you say is very true
I felt while watching that it was like those tweets "I made my AI watch 2000 hours of Batman and then generate a Batman script":
EDIT: and the speech at the climax in the TV show was ridiculous and bad writing since it was totally out of character
If you speak German I happened to start a discussion about it just yesterday:
No self respecting country should have anything to do with bases on its home soil
Why
bloody murder that is why - i mean in the literal sense, "black sites" aka
torture camps, or simply murdering your citizens & people passing through based on suspicion without any resemblance of fair trial
And if they off the wrong guy, its okay mistakes happen
(oh and constant attempts to wiretap local politicans, and hopefully extort them with the information, be it the german cancellor, or the "just" the majority of greek politicians)
Yep, this right here
It's very complicated though
Hard to understand as a foreigner
Ja, habe schon bereut
What kind of argument is that
It´s okay to have froeign (allied) military bc they leave a lot of money here
Most European countries would argue with national pride and lack of sovereignty and wouldn´t care about the money
yeah, about 300 of them
It´s not 40
000 like the other way around
Do you buy flowers to your mom or they are just a waste of money
We have a Milbona Golden Hills branded one over here and the packaging says it was made in Ireland, but now these comments made me *really* question if it has an authentic taste or not
Well, I guess I have one more reason to visit Ireland one day, I gotta try the real deal - especially since this Milbona one tastes quite good already compared to other butters we have here
Do we eat spicy
I mean we do, but isnt that common in other european countries too
If its true than we can only blame the inferiority complex of the avarage hungarian
I did eat a ton of spicy food once, just to show if how cool i was, because I can eat a lot of spicy food
:( I didnt felt good after that, neither in my body or in my mind
Ah, my whole life has been a lie all along
Seriously though, it's somewhat disappointing that they're not like the real deal, especially that they still taste better than their local alternatives, hehe
In my city, there are two shops with all their groceries from Poland
Both are quite small, but the prices are pretty similar to the other nearby grocery stores
Yugoslavia, i recently watched the documentary made by BBC, its crazy
I love history in general, but Sabaton and their album Carolus Rex got me really interested in Swedish history
Not a country, but a collection of them, the Danubian Habsburg Monarchy
And no, calling it simply Austria is not acceptable
I like my own country's history and Europe' history as well
What I would like to know a lot more about is Polish history
They don't teach a lot about it in school
Japan, everything about it is interesting
What
Do you mean the during the raiding period
Honestly as a Hungarian I can encourage you to do so
It's really fascinating how our small country contributed so much to world history
This nation is more than 1000 years old at this point and gets overlooked a lot when we talk about world history but a lot of things happening here or caused by us changed the world forever
Let it be bad or good
Yeah we have contraversial time periods but who doesn't?
Youtube
Well, you were atleast actually part of Austria between 1804 and 1918, but not before
Meanwhile, Hungary was part of it only between 1849 and 1860
Yes, the Black Army was really ahead of its time
It's a shame what happened after him
I would go back in time to watch the 31 match long undefeated run of the hungarian National Team
Than giving them modern football shoes before the World cup final
Summer of 1896
I'd love to see the millenium festivities in budapest
Probably the 1896 celebrations of the millennium of the conquest of the Carpathian Basin
850-900, so I could see how nomadic hungarians looked and lived during the honfoglalás. I'm expecting some central-asian/turkish looking dudes in yurts
Man, hungarians sound so much more interesting befire adopting christianity and feudalism, I would really like to believe that we could have survived without changing religion
Our culture is nothing like our ancestors
1914 June
I would rush to Sarajevo immediately and do everything I can to prevent a certain tragedy
aah yes that's a good choice
i was gonna say something during the dualism and i guess here's my answer
by the way have you read böszörményi gyula's recent series
it was set exactly at that time
yes, it's mostly for young adults but my mom and even my grandmother enjoyed it
Highest ELO rating of all time
Why
First olympics
Millennium celebration
I borrowed the 5th book from the library right before lockdown
I've had it since november and i'm moderately sure some people want to strangle me
Very well researched books, i love the historical bits
I can whistle the tunes of the Soviet and the French anthems, and I know some lyrics from both
Other than that, I could probably recognize the British and the German ones
Football stadiums
Moncler jackets and puffy vests
Do you think they think like that
What TV show has the most amount of episodes in your country
In Hungary Barátok közt (Among friends) has been going for 10334+ episodes and is ending this summer (After airing for around 23
5 years)
You'd have to watch it \~107 days non-stop without breaks to finish the entire show
What is a show that is very long in your country
Amint elolvastam a címet, egyből tudtam, hogy egy magyar írta ki, és azt is tudtam, hogy példának a Barátok köztöt fogja felhozni
:DDD
It is technically Swiss-British-South Korean

Not exactly in my country, but not far
I am hungarian and when we visit our relatives in Slovakia I can barely understand what they say
It seems to be only me though, since my other relatives understand them just fine
I also find their accent mildly annoying
I may be biased though, since I am tired of the Trianon victim mentality they give off
Hungary has some snow every winter, but recently it never lasts for too long
In th recent years we had twice serious snowfalls in March, once in a 4 day long weekend, that was interesting, with all those people stuck on the highways
At the workplace (multinational company) I have a summer job , my co-workers making fun of me and/or making negative comments toward me because I dye my hair (I'm male)
I don't want to imagine what I would got if I had a piercing
Ear piercings are fine pretty much everywhere
My wife works in one of the most conservative professions and she has more than one
No one cares but I'm pretty sure her bosses wouldn't be fine with a nose, lip or eyebrow piercing
That said, most employers don't care about piercings as long as you aren't the face of the company towards customers and it isn't a safety hazard
If you're the face of the company, it depends on its image and sometimes your gender
Women have a bit more freedom when it comes to jewelry
It's accepted by most of the youngsters, but old people can get really upset when they see someone with it
So ladies with earring are considered to be victims of female genital mutilation in Poland
It depends more on company culture than anything else
Some places allow you to be a dick to others, if you have an excuse like conservativism, other require basic human decency and accept no excuses
I believe most of the population is either atheist, non-religious or atleast non-practicing, so fairly normally, I guess
As an Atheist who attended a lot of religious service with friends and family, it seems to me that Catholics think agnostics exist only because they haven't learned about Jesus yet
They always get confused when they find out how much I know about the Bible and still not one of them
Anyway the country has both Christian and Communist heritage therefore theists and agnostics rarely confront each other
We don't just have jokes about our prime minister,we went a step further
We have a joke (quite bad) as a prime minister
I'm Hungarian but when I say Budapest in English, I always pronounce it with an s sound, since pretty much every person I've heard speaking English pronounced it that way
its pronounced with an sh
the letter "s" is always pronounced as an english "sh"
the exceptions are only a couple of older family names
A guy I knew from Rio, Brasil pronounced it Bundapest as a joke
Bunda meaning butt
Of course with "sh". That's the proper Hungarian pronounciation of the city
And tbh and I don't really care if someone pronounce it with "s". But I won't use that way
It's a Hungarian name, I am Hungarian and it doesn't really change the sound of the name
So for me there is no point using the "s", even if everyone in the group uses it that way
This is such a weird question, especially from a non-Hungarian
I always assumed pronouncing with sh is to respect the hungarian pronounciation and not pretentious
When talking to Hungarians it is "Budaopesht".
When talking to foreigners it is "Budápest'
Both the "a" and the "s" sound are different
Hungarian "a" is a mixtrue of English "a" and "o".
Wow
Backwards
> the letter "s" is always pronounced as an english "sh"
That's why most foreigners sound like they have a lisp when they are trying to pronounce our town names, they are saying our "s" like the English "s" when it's supposed to be what "sh" is in English
Not that I blame them, but it does sound weird
I *think* we have that sound too ("ty") and no, we don't.
Buddapesth, but the D is short (RIP)
like the "s" in "six"
We call it Koppenhága (or if you are Ferenc Kazinczy, Kappanhágó...)
>I'll pronounce it Budapesht when Hungarians pronounce Copenhagen "København".
We are fine with *Koppenhága
;-)*
This is the Askeurope thread so I wasn't really referencing francophone canadians saying it this way
I refuse to say Edinburgh's name in anyway but in my own made up Hungarian pronounciation:
Get redi for Edinboró
Yes, that is correct
Yes, but in Polish it's the opposite
yeah the z turns the "sh" sound into an "s" sound
sz considered one letter, just like all of our other "combined" letter (cs, ty, dz etc), bur on keyboards these letters arent included because it would be kinda useless, plus it would take too much space up
it would also be impossible in the first place because the hungarian keyboard is already full of letters
just google a hungarian keyboard and youll see that theres no more space
sz is a short (thats how we call it) letter, meaning thaz the "s" sound is pronounced short
if you wanna make the sound long, (double it), you write "ssz" ("sas" in english would be pronounced like "shash", "szasz" would be pronounced like "sas". then "sszasz" (this word doesnt actually exist, its just for demonstration) would be "ssas". if you know how s/sz works in polish, then its easy to remember
for us it works the opposite way)
the same doubling method applies to every hungarian double, and the one triple letter we have (cs -> ccs; dz -> ddz; dzs -> ddzs; gy -> ggy; ly (this is the same sound as a letter "j". for example: "y" in english "you") -> lly; ny -> nny; ty-> tty; zs -> zzs)
i hope i explained it well lol
I don't think ty=cs, it's a totally different mouth/tongue position
At least for me
Jesz, det iz korrekt
That is a good explanation
You would pronounce "Zs" like the s in leisure
A bit like "s" mixed with "j", yeah
So Zsófia would be something like zhofeeya
With the "zs" as the first letter
lol here we use qwertz and out bottom line goes like:
shift (but smaller than on other keyboards to make space for the í), í, y, x...

Norwegian, Mandarin Chinese and eh I don't know
Arabic sounds pretty but I also like Vietnamese or I could pick any slavic language because I wouldn't be able to learn those otherwise
Or Irish Gaelic
I'd probably just spin a wheel for the third one
Dutch, German, French
I want to live in that area when I'm going to be older, so learning those languages instantly would be a great headstart
german because well i was stupid and didn't took it in school and as some kind of lawyer, it's pretty essential in hungary
spanish, because even tho i took it in school, our teacher was shit
it's a beautiful language tho
third is either korean or french
french for law again, korean for the music and dramas but i'm not sure i want to understand them lol i'd rather just watch subtitles if i feel like it
German, Russian and Japanese
I learnt the first two in school, but I'm not quite satisifed with my level of proficiency, that's why I would choose them
English is a language I'm already quite comfortable with, so instead of wasting my third choice on it, learning Japanese sounds better to me
Not only because I like watching anime, but also because it could open up great job opportunities, since there are some big Japanese firms present in Hungary, like Suzuki and Denzo

Greetings from Hungary
They have been removed, but the site a lot of them were transported to is open, it's called Memento Park
They were all destroyed
Some buildings remained, but were mostly reconstructed
for example
If there was a theather
Now it is a shop
Hammer and sickle, red star, swastika, and others like that are illegal to wear and show in public so you only see them in classrooms and museums
They looked good, and some commie built buildings are still the way they were intended
Boomers don't really give a sh\*t abbout communism or capitalism
My grandma always said:"When I was a kid, I didn't really care about them
when I grew up, de-stalinization came, and it was way more normal
And there are also some monuments in cemeteries
> the 13 meter tall head of Karl Marx in Chemnitz (formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt)
That one was kept because it was considered one of Chemnitz' most important sights
I've never heard about it before so I just googled it
It's a pretty bizarre sculpture, why isn't his neck and some of his torso included
It looks like someone beheaded Marx and put his head on a stand to show it to the people
TEK sometimes does things other than "building relationship with the community" by parading around
They are the people who are ordered to collect high profile organized crime stuff, or that right wing moron who mag-dumped and AK into a police officer
And if you been here since the COVID started you see an armed force member detached to every 1-3 cops when on patrol - who are more heavily armed than handguns
...well thats what military does in peacetime - gross incompetence
[French do like their revolvers] previously mentioned scoped monstrosity was tailor made for one of their specialist police detachments (if thats the correct english terminology ... pff
Sounds strange from the get go
Here its not the job of the run of the mill cops to engage dangerous criminals
The procedure for them is to back off, don't play cowboy & sheriff, calling in the SWAT (equivalent), and let the experts sort things out
After all they have the tools AND THE TRAINING to handle the situation
&#x200B;
P.s.: No handgun has a place in any sort of serious gunfight, they are just backup weapons
In that role revolvers perfectly suffice
And neither pistols nor revolvers hold a candle to either assault rifles, or machine pistols in CQB
...what i meant is that you don't try apprehending suspected bank robber, suspected maffia members, suspected rightwing militants, with random run of the mill officers
That has been done accidentally in the last 10 or so years, and it ended up a 40 something neo nazi gun trafficer mag dumping an AK into the officer
&#x200B;
However i agree that violent crime is far more rare here, and thus its highly unlikely that officers just randomly stop gun toting criminals in a traffic stop
Our continents:
Europe
America
Africa
Asia
Australia
Antarctica
I have seen it in so many variations, that I can't tell how schools teach it, it probably varies by school books
North and South America are usually seen as different continents
Some sources call "Australia and Oceania" a continent, while others call Oceania a continent (which includes Australia)
North-America, South-America, Asia, Afrika, Australia and Oceania, Europe, Antarctica
I was taught this 7
We were also told about Eurasia being a thing
Right now, the government and the mayor of Budapest have a huge conflict as the mayor turned one of the lanes on a major road into a bike lane, which the government says causes huge traffic jams in the city
As you can see on this example, not great
In Hungary the close family is invited to EVERYTHING
Birthdays, anniversaries, everything
They are always held at a home of one family
Ironically, from our extended family we are only in good relations with those who are the farthest away
They live in Slovakia and we visit them sometimes
In the close family, it's always a dinner with tv watching afterwards

King Matthias Corvinus, there are a lot of tales about him
Hunor and Magor
(The Legend)
Árpád, the leader of the Magyar tribes
Sándor Petőfi
Lajos Kossuth
John Hunyadi
Sigismund von Luxembourg
Miklós Horthy
Stephen Szechenyi
I wanted to write more, but I grew tired of it, so here are some notable historical figures of Hungary from only the Middle Ages
Every Hungarian should know them
Saint Stephen, our first king, transformed the loose paganic confederation of the Magyars into a heavily centralised christian kingdom
Saint Ladislaus, another saintly king of ours, mostly known for the canonisation of Saint Stephen and his conquest of Croatia
Andrew II, huge money waster, lead the 5th Crusade, issued the first Golden Bull
Béla IV, the so called "Second Founder", lost against the Mongols, rebuilt the country
Andrew III, the last member of the House of Árpád.
Charles I, first Anjou king, ended the interregnum and feudal anarchy which followed the death of Andrew III, restored royal authority, reformed the economy and made the country rich
Organiser of the Royal Meetings of Visegrád, fromwhich the modern Visegrad Group was inspired
Louis I the "Great", took full advantage of the wealth left behind by his father, and was waging wars endlessly
In the last ten years of his life, he also became King of Poland
Sigismund of Luxemburg, King of Hungary, King of Bohemia and also Holy Roman Emperor
Lost against the Ottomans at Nicopolis, ended the Western Schism, ignited the Hussite Wars and was responsible for the creation of the Southern fort system against the Turks
John Hunyadi, the "Turkbeater", fought against the Turks on countless occassions, lost at the Battle of Varna, became regent-governor of the country and remained until his death
Victor of the Siege of Belgrade of 1456
Matthias Corvinus, son of John Hunyadi, became King of Hungary after the untimely death of Ladislaus V von Habsburg
His rule was marked by absolutism, economic and military reforms, the introduction of Renaissance and by many wars
Conquered most of Bohemia and Austria
Some call his rule the Apex of Hungarian might
* Álmos and Árpád, the conquerors of the Carpathian basin (as well as the six other chieftains: Előd, Ond, Kond, Tas, Huba, Töhötöm)
* Saint Stephen: first king of the country (and possibly his pre-coronation rival, Koppány, due to a [famous rock opera]
* János Hunyadi: famous general who won the [Siege of Belgrade] against the Ottomans
* Mátyás Hunyadi: son of the latter, was elected king, had a mercenary army, became a folk hero after his death
* Lajos II: famous for losing the [Battle of Mohács] causing Hungary's downfall
* István Dobó: won the [Siege of Eger] against a completely overpowered Ottoman army
* Ferenc Rákóczi: started a (failed) war of independence against the Habsburgs
* István Széchenyi: contributed a lot to Hungary's cultural and economic development in the early 19th century, we have the first bridge in Budapest (his idea) named after him
* Lajos Kossuth: political rival of Széchenyi, wanted radical change, later became the leader of a (failed) war of independence
* Sándor Petőfi: famous poet, one of the leaders of the 1848 revolution (later died in war of independence)
* Ferenc Deák: contributed a lot to the Austro-Hungarian compromise, which later established Austria-Hungary as a dual federal state
* Franz Joseph: longest-reigning king of Hungary, famous for defeating the Hungarian revolution, then agreeing to the compromise, later starting WW1 over his nephew's death
* Elisabeth (Sissi): wife of Franz Joseph with an affinity toward Hungarians, possibly contributed to compromise via soft power
* Miklós Horthy: controversial interwar governor of Hungary, achieved temporary territorial gains and contributed to the Holocaust to an unknown level (depends on who you ask)
* János Kádár: communist dictator of Hungary from 1956
I would also add Stephen the First
No what the fuck, I never heard of that
They do love to get piss drunk and make a ruckus though
They treat Hungary like one big club to party at
I've had numerous unpleasant experiences with loud drunk British tourists who came for stag/hen parties

Old imperial instincts kicking in, I presume
It's called a hard brexit for a reason
At least our empire was at least partially Austria's fault
You have nobody to blame
I use English every day for entertainment (movies and such), and my studies, I have good associations with it
As a language compared to mine, it's odd, the pronunciation is silly, the grammar is easy for everyday speech, but the advanced grammar is not intuitive at all for me (with Hungarian's single past and non-existent future tense)
I like learning about the English language, there's so many irregularities
I also enjoy the different accents people have, they are not as common in Hungarian
I think that it's a great international language because of it's simplicity
But it's very different from hungarian in many ways, I'm glad that it's easy, but art like poetry just doesn't strike me as deep as it would otherwise
Aside from the great wovel shif clusterfuck - written & spoken forms of words have little in common - its dead simple
Perfect for lingua franca
Wait till you find out that hungarian uses the same word for he and she - yes, grammatic gender is a minor mindfuck to us (why it even has to exist
Why a book has a gender
) - however we make ip for it with various other bullshit
As a healthy high school student, I'm not afraid of catching the virus (I might already have had it), and I don't live with anyone who is older or has a chronic lung illness or similar so I would be okay with going to school (not to mention I HATED the quarantine school, but I can live with that if it's necessary)
I don't really care, I enjoyed both ways of education
Online classes were not as tiring and I had MUCH MUCH more freetime for myself
The quality of the education was obviously lower, but atleast I didn't feel anxiety because of exams and all of those, just handed in the homeworks and projects, got a good or decent mark, and thats all
Less stressful
Going to school is much more strict as it starts at 8 am, but atleast you have friends to have fun with
It will also be my last year of Gymnasium (Grammar school in english, kinda like Junior High in the USA), so spending this last year with my mates wouldnt be bad at all, I love my class, we are a bunch of idiots having fun in life
As for the virus: My region peaked at like 20 new infections, so I couldnt and cannot really be arsed
I just followed the lockdown rules
Some classes of my uni will probably be online in the fall semester too, which is nice because even if I miss our dear capital city a lot, I absolutely don't want to deal with the rent prices there
I feel safe
I bought a really good mask somewhere, so i can wear it without any issues
"In Hungary, the average number of jerks per capita is two
Géza Hofi
Btw, how well known is Eva Rezešova in Slovakia
Twice
I just asked, because the Bratislava - Košice motorway has been existing for a long time: the Hungarian M1 and M3 (through Budapest), and she caused an accident on the M3 en route to Bratislava for which she was in prison in Hungary for some years
It created a huge uproar
Good to know she had caused accidents on other occasions
I know Fico meant that, it's just an ironic saying in Hungary because of the extra traffic load on these motorways caused by the missing motorway in Slovakia
Well, the public opinion was very strongly against her, not because she's a Slovak, but because she was drunk and drugged, and killed four innocent travelers in a cheap car with her heavy SUV while speeding in the night
So it was unimaginable that she wouldn't have to go to prison
EDIT: she tried to bribe an expert to testify that the accident was the victims' fault, but it was quickly revealed, so even if she had had a chance somehow to miss the prison, this was the last straw
It would have been interesting to follow the Hungarian news about her as a Slovak, because she had been literally and totally unknown in Hungary before the accident, so initially she was just a random foreign woman
Of course, as the story unfolded, we also got to know her background, but initially we were totally unbiased, and still very angry at her
I'm from Hungary, i think you can guess
On a political level, it's flexing at each other on every tiny reason they can find and call it cultural, historical, whatever reason
This of course fuels the masses so widespread dislike of the country is common and i'm afraid next year will be even worse as neither of the sides will want to stop
On a persona level i'v been in Romania plenty of times and i never had any issues
People are decent when you're decent and they didn't care where i'm from
If we can't talk in English, they either talk or understand Hungarian
And i'm not talking about the Hungarians there, they obviously do speak Hungarian
Also, as i mentioned on an other thread, Romania has a pretty decent Ice Hockey team :)

- sadly this is not an unfounded stereotype
Oh and stuff like [THIS] or [THIS]
A complete travesty of a country under communism, who used local nazi groups (of Bucharest progrom fame) as agents for torture murder and coercion
Had an orphanage "system" thanks to abortion ban that (rightfully) inspired the vampire twins from black lagoon, and after it got dissolved the situation somehow managed to get worse
At the same time bulldozing ethnic hungarian villages was the fad
Its also beyond me how Vlad the Impaler, or Nazi war criminals can be seen as national heroes, and have statues erected on townsquares
Its also the only country where you have drug addict gypsy gangs in the capital's sever system
Some strange fascination with retconning history - they are apparently all people with full roman ancestry (as opposed to fully romanized local people like in france)
The Hunyadi/Corvinus family was clearly full of the mighties of romanian nationalism
(To some degree i can empathize, we also have the same idiots here in hungary, according to whom everyone was, and everything was invented by a hungarian - at least they are not mainstream ...yet
Oh and the country where the majority of students flopped at high-school graduation exam after video recording of the event was mandated
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
And of course its the full time partner of ours so that our football hooligans have a constant competitor to measure their destructive power against (i mean against romanian football hooligans)
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
All in all a perfectly fine country (if we are willing to finally forget the damned historical grudges), with some glaring mistakes, just like our own - of course due to the idiocy & incompetency of the government taking a different from than ours, it looks damn funny from the outside
Romania bad, Hungary good
Mostly to Cluj-Napoca, the road there from the direction of Oradea or Arad
I've also been in a couple of places in Transylvania
Yes, i know i only visited places where you likely meet Hungarians, but my experience is that Romanian people learn the language at least on a get by level
I like your mountain roads
Well, the idiots are moving on the 1000 years old hungarian kingdom and we want all transylvania back
From my perspective, transylvania has never been mine, so I don't care and it does not matter how strongly the bloody politicians are trying to divide us, we have more in common then either of us can imagine
We both eat stuffed cabbage for christmas, we both drink tuica/palinka, so why the hate

It has a lot to do with being at the farthest reaches of the realm of the habsburgs, who forced gypsies to settle down ,and abandon their wicked ways
With more success in the former than in the latter
And the further you go from Vienna, the latter is less visible
As in the so called "rule of law" is something unheard, and some sort of tribalistic sense of justice is adhered to
In large cities with roma heavy slums, you will get strange looks, may get pickpocketed
In small  complete roma villages, you get pickpocketed by kids, and you may get linched
And then there are romanian gypsies
...no offence to romanians but you just don't have drug addictedgangs of them in the severs in any other capital, nor do i see traditionally dressed gypsies (in very layered cothing) cooking and festering in 40°C at noon under the sun, unless they are from there
And probably adds to the stereotype that there were some whole gypsy communities that left romania for somewhere else as the were
Canada for example
I'm well aware that it's likely my own and biased experience where i may have been lucky as fuck
And I'm pretty sure you know what pálinka is
The romas actually came from india, and there are childrens tales about how the sun gifted them with their skin color and how everyone hates them becouse they are jealous
harsh
How to insult Turkey even more:
"Sure they have the most, but they are not a part of europe
But I mean you, like us, are sandwiched between Slavic nations, and you have been disconnected from the other Romance nations for a long time
I have travelled all over Romania, and I didn't get the vibes I got in Italy for example
Edit: I am not saying, that by travelling through Romania I become a master, but this is what I, as an outsider experienced
The oldest is probably the [Castle of Diósgyőr] another very old building is the [Gothic Protestant Church of Avas]
Horthy Miklós (governor of Hungary) lead his anty-communist troops and the white terror from a villa in my town
It's  an hotel today, but it's in the middle of the "party part" of the town, so I don't think it's a good resting place
It's called Thanhoffer Villa
There are other villas near the lakeshore, that belonged to famous people
The less historical, but more famous landmark is the Watertower
It was converted to a café and bar, very good view, but expensive
The Ruin Garden, for example
It's the remains of the Nagyboldogasszony Basilica, which was originally built by our first king, Saint Stephen
It was modified and expanded numerous times during its existence, and it was the largest cathedral in Central Europe by the time it was destroyed during the Long Turkish War
Damn that was a fast answer
We're not Turkic though
We have two words for it, but don't know if they sound like "dude that is so metal". The common one is "kalapács" (we use this almost exclusively), and the other one is "pöröly".
In hungarian it's *kalapács*. Which is (unbiased) the most badass I've seen in this comment section
In Hungarian we translate the 'Martell' for 'pöröly' but the 'hammer' is 'kalapács'
Edit: The 'pöröly' in english is 'sledgehammer'
Tbh "pöröly" sounds kinda badass
I had to look that up
You are right, there is a band called Kalapács, but I have never heard about them before
The name of the founder and singer is József Kalapács, so they weren't too creative regarding the name
I think this band is not really well known, or maybe that's because I don't really listen to metal
Anyways, József Kalapács used to be the singer of the band called "Pokolgép" which is far more popular
It's difficult to tell without knowing what their degree, job and location is
If it's a teacher in Budapest, they'll need a second job or financial support from their family even if they have roommates
If it's a software developer in Budapest, they can probably rent their own flat in one of the cheaper districts and still save a few hundred euros
Here a fresh teacher (English language - Geography as an example) with a masters degree earns less than 700 € the rent itself takes away at least 200-300 € (bills not included)
We have a massive teacher shortage btw
I’m making an assumption that you don’t live in Budapest, solely based on the rent cost
I really don’t understand how teachers get by in the capital, they all have my highest respect
You are right, it's not Budapest level rent
I would hate to freeze on the Tatras
It's unfortunately very common
Most men think it's ok to do it
One time i was on a first date with a guy and while he was walking me home, he just said he had to pee, took off to a tree few metres away and peed like no one's business
I was really disappointed in him
It's just common, while walking my dog, I see guys peeing at least once every two weeks and that is way too many
It's not just drunk guys either, just men going home from the grocery shop, not being able to keep it in until they get home despite being adults
Well, I also saw one time a woman just squat down in a fucking bus stop, pull down her pants and piss in front of people waiting for a bus
So, I guess it's not just men, but I've only ever seen this one woman, and hundreds of guys doing it
It's super disgusting, but it seems most people don't think so
Czechia has far more forests than Scotland
So the average hiker denstiy in said forest is likely to be a lot lower
I don't get why there are only two options: al dente or mushy
Mushy is disgusting, but I don't really like al dente either
I prefer somewhere in between (closer to al dente, but decidedly not that)
As long as it is not crunchy, I don't really care
Pro tip: fry them in oil
Any random store
Usually we don't put milk in fridges (cuz u don't need to) and it's shocking to a lot of people
Same here, and from what I've experienced in Romania too
We only smile when we have a genuine reason
Im afraid to ask this, but whats wrong with ketchup on pizza
Why do you do that
>Usually we don't put milk in fridges (
Everyone I know puts it in the fridge
Before you open it
We don't have a spelling be for 1 reason, we pronounce everything exacly as we write it, for example in english if you say the word 'cigaretta' and 'enjoy' you pronounce the two 'e's differently, but there is no such thing in hungarian, and e is an e, so a spelling bee wouldn't make sense
The closest thing that I encountered was in my elementary school but it was more about writing tricky, commonly misspelled and foreign words correctly
In hungarian the spelling really closely follows the pronunciation, so no spelling bees here
We have grammar and spelling competitions
(I used to be quite good at them
) They usually involve writing down a spoken text
But it's nothing like the spelling bee
Hungarian spelling rules are quite consistent with pronunciation, so the main challenges are capitalisation and punctuation
Also, they are not televised at all, it's more like writing a test
You don’t need spelling bees when your language has a highly phonemic orthography
Yap, even putting phonetic languages aside, it's just such an obscure thing, I was really weirded out by the idea when I first heard of it
It sounds so forced and harmful towards the kids participating in it
generally having kids (<15yo) on national TV is kind of sketchy; but the thought of 12 year olds competing on a national level, on TV, especially in such a pointless skill doesn't sound awfully healthy
Geographical names can be really confusing when the -i suffix is added
True, but we pronounce it as j/ly every time
And there are some grammar rules about that too
Every 4 years we have a choice between Viktor Orban and Orban Viktor
In Hungary, we vote for a party on the general list; and then each elective territory has a representative assigned to them from all parties; whoever wins will get into the Parliament
The representatives are much more important than the general list, as if one party gets 2/3rd of the representatives (133) into the Parliament they win automatically (as FIDESZ changed the laws to be able to pass every law with a 2/3rd majority
It's pretty skewed, as even in 2018, Fidesz only got 49% of the votes on the general list but they still have majority in the Parliament, mostly because the opposition couldn't agree on who to run as a representative in many places
Hahaha exactly except we don’t have debates
I think it is not just a country thing but a gender thing too
I am a 30 years old female, have a long term relationship without engagement or kids: my old relatives are worried like sh*t that I won’t have a proper family
(Yeah, 6 years living together and sharing everything is not proper enough I guess)
They mention it on every family gathering . Although my parents are chill about it, they don’t really care till I am happy
My brother is 35, married but no children: nobody gives a f*ck
He is not harassed by old lady relatives and he was never pressured before the marriage either
These are only stereotyps and actually none of that is true
Except one
Buda: rich smartasses
Pest: entitled, arrogant people or flat-orks, thinks hungary is Buda, Pest and lake Balaton, the rest of the country is just illusion
BAZ county: incest and poor gypsies
Nógrád: rich gypsies
Debrecen: nice people and gypsies
Esztergom: our minivatican
Komárom: "we still flying a half ship"
Baranya: uranium miners and nice peoples
Zala: woodcutters
Somogy: absolutly superior in everything
Győr: rich german and austrian spies
You forgot Miskolc our own little incest land
Also there are basically no mines and no industry here just the restaurants
Miskolc is the center of BAZ county
Missed that
So funny that most Austrians hate Germans and as far as I know most Germans have no problem with Austrians
I mean why can't you just see Germany as the older brother
Many Austrians don't want to do anything with Germans, just ignoring them
I think if Austria wanted to cooperate with Germany, it would be an improvement for both countries especially for you, Austrians
No problem, have a nice day
When the language is the same it's much easier to work together, because you don't have to translate everything to English and then to the third language
I didn't said you two should unite or something, just that you could save some money
With older brother I meant that Germany is bigger and it's economy is superior than Austria's.
Okay :DD
Just one last thing :D
If you could choose a country to work together with reeeeaaaly closely then it wouldn't be Germany, right
I like it
You can visit a different culture every year for a 12$ ryanair ticket, and the flight takes less then 2hrs
or you can drive and still visit some countries
But in covid times I envy Americans
Now we are basicly trapped in our little countries
I saw the most interesting stuff already, some of them multiple times
But in the us you can still visit different places
however just an example:
In the summer we plan to walk with a tent from Budapest(Hungary) to the sea (Croatian coast) through Slovenia
We can visit 3 countries literally by foot
Of course the tour will take about 20+ days(540km), but its still crazy we can do this
The Maria Valerie Bridge is in Esztergom, Hungary
You step out into the street, you cross the bridge and you're Slovakia lovakia just like that
An example:
We once visited the water park in Lutzmannsburg, Austria
After we left, we walked across the border to Zsira, Hungary to have dinner, then walked back to our hotel in Austria
I really enjoy it, we go to school trips to Romania, Austria, Slovakia and sometimes even farther to Germany or the UK
(Of course I haven't been to all these places, I just put together the experinces of my friends and family; my school trips went to Vienna and the UK
1 mile = 1
6km
[Egg dumpling "cutter"]
It's used to reduce the making of [egg dumplings] from half an hour to just a few minutes
Also, I recently found out that [flat flush toilets] (the ones with the "poop shelf") aren't really common anywhere else besides here and Germany
It’s the go-to coffee maker in Hungary as well
IMO also the best way to make coffee
I know a similar thing, but maybe just because my grand-grandparents were so poor and kept these things for a longer time than others
I mean the schitzelklopfer is not an uncommon thing here (probably German influence but still)
>does poo not get like stuck to them
Not really
They do leave a slight mark most of the time but you can just clean it with a toilet brush
I personally like it that I don't have to worry about toilet water splashing up
I'm not sure, I guess it prevents water splashing up
Can confirm
Among many other things Hungary is the country of 10 million poop inspector after all
"Gaming is not a crime"
I wish people took littering more seriously like the Japanese do:(
The acceptance of other sexual orientations, genders, races and religions
Bike lanes in cities, that are safe
In Budapest, where I would have to cycle to uni, the bike path is in the single most used road of the city, just painted up on the side, buses and cars have to go around me
Parks (plural) there's clearly not enough here, if the weather's nice, they are full, it's not fun for me, no wildlife, too many people
It really is convenient and our only civilizational advantage compared to the DACH-countries
WW2 bombs under everything
Older buildings under the old buildings (I swear Buda Castle is like eleven layers of fortresses underneath the Castle)
Roman ruins under old buildings
One day you find out that that one barricaded doorway in the basement of your secondary school leads down to an uncharted 16th century cellar system that runs the length of the town centre, but noone's been down there in a century
Well sometimes pipes and waterproofing can be a problem, the house I'm living in has hay as the ceiling insulation, putting a lamp can be a difficult thing if you don't know where the main wooden structure is
The barricaded doorway went by the name 'the Basilisk's cave' among students, and we were forbidden from going there
Also it was pretty heavily barricaded with old furrniture
The cellars are said to lead to the Mayor's office/ municipal bureau (and a bunch of other buildings that are gone/ the entrances were destroyed), but noone knows if the cellars are still intact, because noone's been there in a while
I read about the whole affair in the local newspaper, when some explorations were proposed or planned, but nothing since
A short Wikipedia search reveals that while it became urbanised during the Industrial Revolution, Dortmund and Duisburg were important trading cities under the Hanseatic League during the Middle Ages
(Sidenote: The Ruhr area is part of the Rhine-Ruhr area, which includes further cities  like Cologne, which was also an important city during the Middle Ages as well
Fidesz worshippers always say that "wAs It BetTeR iN gYuRcSáNy'S TiMe
" (Gyurcsány - our previous PM)
And anyone else is a communist in their eyes
Which is something I never understood, because I mean I get it when Americans call something they don't like communism, but you'd think that people in Hungary, a country which was actually communist, would know what communism really is
But nope, every slightly left leaning party is already Marxist Leninist stuff for them
Also, their arguement often involves Hungary not having any migrants thanks to Orbán the Almighty
In their 2018 election campaign, their propaganda consisted of "Vona wants to tear down the border fence and let all the migrants in
" (Vona was the leader of the strongest opposition party until he resigned after losing the election)
Also also, Soros
Everything is Soros
Coronavirus is Soros
Migrants is Soros
Brussles is Soros
retiretards shoot off "oszt a gyúcsány jobb vót?" every time you try to convince them the oranges have to go to not slide into yet another dictatorship, even now, when the opposing parties joined forces and will try to knock off Orbán the 1st off his throne in 2022
the phrase means "but was (Ferenc) Gyurcsány [the previous PM, Hungarian Socialist Party] better
" with mocking spelling
I mean
the whole opposition is coming together to form an anti-Fidesz party, I don't believe that the general public would actually care who the opposition is, it's safe to say that a lot of people not voting for Fidesz does so to be anti-Fidesz
Also I often get the argument from people that Fidesz is the lesser worse party
As far as I remember it was Vona, who first started talking about building a fence on the border, so Orbán's accusation was even more ridiculous
You know what they say
Polak, węgier
Apparently we do *everything* together
Well, government propaganda is displayed on like 90% of media outlets, plus Hungary has quite a lot of retired people, and all the older generation needs to hear is that Orbán will raise their pension
Another issue is the uneducated layer, who doesn't even know what fidesz's policies are, they are as disconnected from reality as one possibly can be
Their vote is usually bought by some sacks of potatoes
[Here] is a video showing what kinds of people vote for FIDESZ
(You can turn on English subtitles)
De akkor ki fog minket figyelmeztetni, hogy a "Kígyók kígyóznak"?
no, they are just stuck in the time before the USSR commited nonexistence, they are indoctrinated the communist way therefore easily manipulated by the goverment, and the orange cunts mastered just that
these "nyugger"s are our classic thick-skulled idiots who cannot be reasoned with, even if you show them solid evidence that Orbán fucks them over too they will just throw excuses like they were programmed responses
why am I jumping at these old bastards only
like a big portion of Europe, we have an aged society, so they make up a pretty big part of the people who can vote, and their offsprings are often also indoctrinated by their parents and are similarly impossible to argue with
they don't vote orange in spite of someone (other than scapegoats), they vote because they were told to, by you-already-know-who, and they never question them, because they were teached against it
"vót" is "volt" but with a country accent, meaning "was", and considering our history, I wouldn't call a word beautiful when it points to the past, because ours is depressing
by the way, our word for vote is "szavazás" (the event itself) or "szavazat" (the vote you cast on the ballot)
Oh, and silly me, I forgot another thing
You know how he gave Hungarian citizenship to the Hungarians in Transylvania
Well, many of them also vote for him, despite not having lived 1 minute in his country
All they know, is that our previous PM rejected them, and now Orbán cares for them
That's plus many votes
Congrats, now you meet the requirements to vote for fidesz
it's not about the culture being bad, because it's not at all (in fact it's one of the richest in this entire continent and something to be proud of), it's the constant decline of the competence of our leaders throughout history that is still rolling downhill today
There was a tradition NOT to clink glasses (bottles) if you drink beer
Thus remembering/honouring the revolution of 1848 when - according to the legend  - the Austrians celebrated the execution of the 13 leaders with drinking beer and clinking glasses
Later an urban legend emerged saying historians had agreed that the 150 years were over and Hungarians now are allowed to do so, so people stopped NOT clinking
I find this a nice tradition, even though Austrians are not our enemies any more, I try not to clink my glass
Magázás/tetszikelés. In Hungarian language there are four forms of speech
Tegezés, önözés, magázás and tetszikelés. Think of like the Duzen/Siezen in German but with four patterns and a bit more complex grammar
**Tegezés** is the most informal one, it is used between family members, friends and kids
This form is using Te
(you) and basic conjugation
**Önözés/Magázás** uses Ön/maga (you) and some more complicated conjugation
Both are formal, önözés is more polite
Maga is kind of distancing and in certain contexts can be even straigh up rude
This is usually used in official context and when adults meet they use Ön (usually transferring to tegezés soon after)
Also used in shops or other daily "business" meetings
**Tetszikelés** is an auxulary word used with verbs when talking to elders
Its conjugation is complex and even in Hungarian certain words can be "fucked up" with it, sounding weird or straight up not correct
So tetszikelés and magázás/önözés are losing a lot of ground to tegezés. Often even in shops or formal meetings people use tegezés without even the introductory önözés phase
I'm not a super formal person, but it's kinda weird to me that a 20yo girl in some shop says Te to my almost 60yo father
IMO it's a very nice way to show respect to each other
Splashing girls with water during the Easter is starting to die out
People just stopping dying it after elementary, because they only know the "going to old female family members for money" side of it
I heard it is very uncommon in the capital, because people there are living in apartments, that isn't suitable for a good splash of water/ or they do it with cologne that is the boring fucking way to do it
Me and the boys still do it with our girlfriends/crushes or female friends and they actually like it, because
well
who doesn't like getting splashed with several buckets of water by their friends once a year
>Śmigus-dyngus mainly becouse of weather (last few years we were more likely to have snow on easter than on christmas) and people carrying electronics
We still have it in most places, though people in cities usually use perfume
It also disappeared here, but the greeting "(Kezét) csókolom
" (I kiss [your hand]) is still used when greeting older people
>Austrians are not our enemies any more
Good, good make them believe that
Our revenge will come
We will shit into their beer reserves
You are a great soldier of the Hungarian Resistance
Jesus does the gift delivery himself in Hungary on Christmas Eve as well
I don't think he will be superseded by Santa here, since Santa is also coming already on the 6th of December to fill your nicely cleaned shoes with sweets
One might say that this is a good example of letting each other live, others might say they formed a cartel and divided the market between themselves
You dont
Because the roads are in a such bad condition that your car will most likely break down (except if you drive a Lada Niva)
Same happened to me but in a rural area like 100 m from my house
When I saw the approaching car I stopped on the side of the road as there is no way for two cars to pass at the same time
The other guy did not even slow down and hit my mirror, luckily no damage done
Is there a "law" in Germany where you have to give priority for the car going upwards
I live in a hilly area and I rarely see this happen
Yes, most of such roads in the UK have got a national speed limit of 60mph~100kmh which is slightly mind boggling to me
For Hungary, I think it would be either one of [Brahms' Hungarian Dances] (even though Brahms was German) or [Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No
I would like to say Hungarian Rhapsody because
yeah
okay, this is a long shot but for hungary, gloomy sunday came to mind first a.k.a the infamous suicide song
ngl people love to feel sorry about themselves here and the suicide rates are pretty high so i guess why not
its definitely not a national anthem or anything but it has it's legacy and i think most people sorta respect this song a lot
I mean Erika is not a nazi song
Same as your Luftwaffe logo
What about "Wir sind des Geyers schwarzer Haufen"? That seems like being abused multiple times, but what are the current notions on that one
In Romania there is a city called Satu Mare which literally means big village, while it is actually a city with 100000+ people
(There is a village, too, called Satu Mare in Romania)
In the small town of Lábatlan, meaning 'legless', everybody I've seen had legs
Massive disappointment
Budapest suburbs called Kistarcsa (little Tarcsa) and Nagytarcsa (big Tarcsa)
Kistarcsa is way bigger than Nagytarcsa
Por-tó means Lake Dust in Hungarian
I have, but I'm not working full time, am still a uni student
Budapest is the most international, but I think Sopron feels the most foreign as it lays besides the Austrian border, more than the 5% of the population's native language is German and there are lots of people there who are going to the other side of the border to work, to shop, to study or to do something else
Islay is absolutely amazing
Love it
Of course it has to be hungarian
We are in straigth track to reach zero population, thanks to everyone leaving the country - and  not forcing their offspring to learn this monster of a language once they are living abroad full time
&#x200B;
So like in the good old days of latin, hungarian can be the common language
It plays no favourites
It sucks equally for everyone to learn it
Hungarian speaks for itself
One of the best options for an easy-to-learn, adaptive language for all of Europe, right behind Mandarin and Arabic
I saw a study once (cannot find the link, maybe someone else
) that stated that Hungarian is one of the most average languages globally (i.e. a language that shares features with most languages)
Only problem - while Hungarian is similar to many other languages **globally**, on a European level: not really
Well, it would be interesting
We have a lot more word than english, and we write everything as we say it, thats a pro
But if everyone would have to learn it
The grammar is so different from English, it's like german, but more extreme
But if everyone would just start speaking hungarian, than I see no disadvantage
Once i put on this [song] and my ex thought it's your language
I was honored
>Romanian : easiest language on earth to spell , all letters have always same sound and we always say all letters in the world as clear as possible ( no rules like French or English or even Dutch )
Having a phonetic writing system is not that unique, same is true about hungarian, or even german
Or Hungarian
I feel like I've summoned a demon
I really don't see how the language could survive if it only exists in transsylvania
Without being used as a laguage of science, administration ...etc
the language doesn't develop - and due to lack of functionality, it will simply cease to be used, as the topics that can be discussed with it become fewer and fewer
See the decline in celtic languages
When the language is hard to learn, and is barely functional "cultural pride" won't save it from going extinct
While i cannot be more supportive of my polish brothers, i think we would all need some extra help with your compounding consonants
The biggest issue with hungarian is that we have some sounds that are not present in most languages
Other than that its trivial
Yes, German has a few problems - however its pretty much nothing compared to English
Well yes but actually no
I used to go camping in Slovakia as a child - this is one of the very few words I remember
:-)
There are soooo many dialects and languages of the Roma people
just 7 in and around Hungary
Thx
(Your y looks strange to hungarians since, we only us y as part of digraphs (gy, ny, ty), so its only a letter on its own in foregin words
I guess its not worse than the classis s & sz things that most languages do in reverse compare to hungarian))
Voiced "s" is "zs" and voiced "cs" is "dzs".
And for english speakers you tehre is also ö & ü, which tends to produce funny results
Thats to be expected, since the vocabular has exactly nothing in common with indoeuropean languages, including romanian or slavic languages
Not to mention that the language is very agglutinative - aka
it like sticking words, adjectives and such together - which also makes it harder, since thats not a common feature in most languages
For example instead of of using the word "in", we stick "...ban" on the end of the word, for example it would be houseban
And those compound - so multiple things get stuck onto the same word - sometimes a lot of them
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
I only meant that pronouncing written words should be pretty easy, i am sorry if i mislead the people into thinking that picking up the language is easy
Well at least it was somewhat helpful for us hungarians
Well its just a table to "translate" polish digraphs into their hungarian counterparts
Treating our minorities like shit and pulling the biggest Pikachu face when they wanted independence
World war 1
Not really
Joseph II
Habsburg replaced the official language (latin) with German and tried to germanize Hungary, but in practice the vast majority of his decrees were not put into effect regionally (counties had autonomy)
So he take away the autonomy if the counties, but still nobody really cared about him
He was not even legally king (to be that, one had to be crowned in Székesfehervár by the bishop of Esztergom with the crown of St Stephen), which he didn't do
That's why we call him the "hat king".
He tried to force german education and all that on all the peoples in the Empire but he ultimately failed and abolished all his previous decrees on his deathbed, let alone for 3
Other than that, there were other attempts too by different monarchs, but none succeded

We know nothing for 100%, all we have are theories
>- Instead of being assimilated, we were the ones who assimilated the Slavs coming here (explains why a few grammatical constructs like the vocative case in Romanian appear to be similar or inherited from Slavic languages)
I also sometimes wonder about what would've happened if we were assimilated instead of us assimilating others
It's weird how Bulgarians lost their language, but we didn't. But if we were assimilated I think we would've adopted the German language instead of a Slavic one
Does everybody know everybody in your country
Yeah
And the Holy Crown of Hungary is a mesopotamian (MEZŐ-potámia
mező means field ---> grain field, where did agriculture start
) is a star map that can lead the navies of the Sirius Star-Empire to the Reptilian Arch-world and put an end to the million yers long war between our species
I can even imagine a scenario where the nobility speaks German and the serfs speak Slavic
Asks someone from a country that has only existed for 28 years
I know 'Dia duit
' and "Póg mo thóin
' in Irish, so if I were to introduce myself to an Irishman from the gaeltacht, I think I'd make a questionable first impression
(Dia duit: hello; Póg mo thóin: kiss my ass)
>"Strč prst skrz krk"
I know this one too
It is "az angyalát" (so basically: * their angel) similar to  "a kutya fáját" (the tree of the dog)
We usually say these when we want to swear, but can't. (for example: a little kid is in the room)
Everytime I go to Vienna by car, somehow this song pops up in the radio all the time and my brain connects this song with Vienna lol
Can't wait for a greek to say ,,Our debt
Hope this didn't offend anyone
The dark sense of humour
That's the way
De biztos hogy *dugnád?*
In hungarian, we called spoiled children "elkényeztetett". It basically translates to "pleasured".
Spoiled you mean
Well, the word translates to pleasured
I think it must be the weight that misleads people
As most tend to mentally depict weight on the "1t = 1 car" basis
And that makes it seem like stonhenge is a lot bigger than it is since the boulders are a lot denser than cars
We have it here in Hungary, we call it "almafröccs". Which translates to "apple spritzer"
Apfelschorle is sold and consumed in Hungary as well
Of course, it's a very recent thing, but restaurants understand the Hungarian word for it, and they even make it from Cappy apple juice and sparkling water if they don't have it readily
I thought we are the only ones
I think you don't mean that but in most of our restaurants you can order "mixed side dish" which is french fries and boiled rice
For classical folks we are trying to use proper names, but for a while famous writers theri name got translated to hungarian
I grew up reading Verne Gyula, for example
We keep them in Hungarian too
(or transcribe the original spelling)
Then what would you think of that Hungarian texts used to translate even contemporary foreign names until like 1900
Examples:
Jules Verne - Verne Gyula (even the name order was changed
Karl Marx - Marx Károly
George Stephenson - Stephenson György
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe - Goethe János Farkas
etc
Hungary has excellent tap water
No, i am sorry but that is not true
You and austria has okay bread, france is also okayish bubt surprisingly hungary has the best selection of fresh bread baked every day
I have this on the window of this very room I'm sitting in right now
We do it like the rest of the world, nod for yes, shake for no
Why would you think that
We do it the “normal” way
TBH I was surprised to read that you guys do the opposite
Wow, it's really that
I don't get why the users say "carbs+carbs" or it's redundant: you don't get twice as much side dish, you get 1/2 portion french fries and 1/2 portion rice
Both are carbs, but the textures are different: crunchy fries and soft rice
I sometimes order this
Yeah
For the longest time - as a kid - I believed him to have been a Hungarian author, because of the aforementioned practice
Yes :)
May Károly
To be fair the congo was basically Leopolds private enterprise during the worst period
I actually remember hearing something along the lines of "romanians were so cruel even the nazis found it too much" though I don't know how true is it
What did you guys do
I mean apart from collaborating with the nazis
We have a few, but they for some reason keep insisting on being a different country
Madness, right
...what the hell is a "Slovakia" anyway
No idea how common place in Hungary, but we certainly had these
I think now we have something from IKEA
Yes they absolutely are a thing in Hungary, my gandmother had a frabric cutter as others said, but we also had simple big ones (two) and a small one, now my mom also has two big scissors and basically we had one lying somewhere at all of my jobs, they're pretty great
It wouldnt
Unless if im missing something
Which would be really embarassing lol
It wouldn't
Yes, with plums, but my family often makes them with cherries
In Hungary they are rolled in them, and there's some on the side
It's the finely ground stuff you'd use for breading
Do you have the cottage cheese/Quark dumplings in CZ
The dough is with semolina, not potatoes
It's pretty much mandatory to eat that with sweetened sour cream, it's great
At 11:45 pm I'd probably eat something that the bar has to offer or order a pizza
At 3:00 am I'd be drunk enough to go for a cheap Döner Kebab that will give me a bad stomach the next day
Probably some sort of döner or burger, and then I'd go back right to the pub/bar, 11:45 is way too early
The Parliament building and the Chain Bridge are probably the top2
The former is included in Civilization VI, the latter is on our 200 Ft coin
Other noteworthy landmarks are Buda Castle, Saint Stephen's Basilica, the Gellért Hill Citadel, Heroes' Square, Andrássy Road
Outside Budapest, the basilicas of Esztergom and Szeged, the village Hollókő, the Hortobágy Nine-Hole Bridge, as well as various castles (e.g. Eger, Sümeg) and châteaus (e.g. Nagycenk, Gödöllő) come to my mind
What a good question op, let me just say I’m sure nobody would guess but it’s definitely our parliament, the most beautiful in Eur— wait what’s this comment here
You have the world's largest parliament building - and the church on the other side of the road is larger
:-D
Thanks, i built it myself
Choose the width of the tire depending on the roads - thin tire are less effort but might be a problem with potholes
The number of gears depends also on the terrain - for some places 3-7 are enough, I usually don't mind having 18-21 when going up
Driving in traffic is mainly practice, a few suggestions:
-always watch your back
-keep at least a door distance from parking cars, and watch them if they want to start
-don't use the very far end of the road, if there's a pothole with a car on your left it's dangerous
-in a roundabout go in the middle - it's probably against the law, but many drivers might have the idea that they can leave easily before you when they actually can't
-when going forward in a crossing always, ALWAYS check your back if somebody wants to go right, trucks might not notice you
-please do stop at red lights
-always have working lights and brakes
In Hungary there is two big parties in commute bikers
The first one uses super old bikes from the ‘70s-‘80’s mostly from East Germany or Austria
These people are usually live in smaller cities and young people in Budapest who don’t want to spend so much on a bike
My first adult bike was a [Puch] Clubman, I used it for 10 years during University and my first job, loved it, brought me everywhere
The second group is people with new bikes designed for a bit rough roads, mostly fitness bikes
These bikes a bit more expensive, but better to ride in out shitty Eastern-European roads
They are easier to fix because there are more spare parts on the market
Fucking bullshit
I've been there many times
I can count it on one hand
It's 14
Eurasian catfish can grow up to 300kg
However it rarely reachey that age as people fish it for its tasty meat
As such specimens over 50-60kg are rare, and mostly found in places like Chernobil exculsion zone, where its dumb to eat them, and places like the delta of the Po river in Italy, as italians don't eat freshwater fish often
The real intresting (and scary) part is that they are very common, found ineven relatively small ponds - and the biigest ones tend to come from suc unexpected places as people dont go catfishing in the unaccesible small pond
It was free from 895 to 1541, then partially free until 1699, completely free by 1718
It remained to be free until 1849, when it came under foreign rule, which lasted until 1860
In 1867, the country entered into a real union with Austria, which meant giving up some of our sovereignty to common institutions with them
Despite this, I would still say this era was free
This era lasted 'til 1918, when Austria-Hungary collapsed after more than four years of total war, with complete isolation from international markets
After the Treaty of Trianon, the remaint rump of the country was free, the rest, well
it's controversial
After the fall of France in 1940, the country grew increasingly dependent on the whims of Germany, and in 1944, the country was first occupied, then a coup installed a nazi puppet regime
After the war, the country was under heavy Soviet influence, but was more or less free until 1949, when the communists took over completely
We remained a Soviet satellite until 1989, with the brief exception of a few days in 1956, but then once again, we became independent
In 2004, we joined the EU, and similar to the case of Austria-Hungary, gave up some of our sovereignty
I would still consider ourselves to be free though
11th century (?) - 1463 (Ottoman rule)
Idk, you were kinda Hungarian vassals for a good portion of that time
Belgrad
We were there for a day on our trip to Montenegro and it was such a mess of a city
They are kinda rebuilding it but in a soviet-esque fashion, and half of the city is like ruins and half of it is this kind of a construction site and cigarette butts
Athens
Dirty, loud, unliveable, a lot of closed shops, run down tenements
I mean it has its breathtakingly wonderful parts, but most of the city is sad to look at
Hmm, I loved Warsaw
Agreed
There are far better places all around Ireland, two days in Dublin were fine, trinity college, Guinness museum, dinner in Howth but the countryside was far more interesting
Also Galway was not that great either (though the surrounding region is charming)
Came here to say this
There´s just literally nothing nice in Milan besides that one dome that you actually find in every major European city
Wierd, I absolutely loved Athens last year when I was visiting
Although I’m a sucker for ancient Greek ruins and museums so I was having a blast
Agree on Thessaloniki though, it’s just a city, not too many interesting things there
Just out of curiosity, why would you caution against Athens
Yeah the center was pretty good, but it was just so hard to find it, and we didn't find it that big, maybe we were clueless there
>Maybe the guy drunk who threw up right next to me
What does that drunk guy have to do with Krakau
I visited Krakau many times, one was nicer than the other
The Rynek, Wawel, the narrow streets, the beautiful girls, all made a very good impression on me
You'd be served without a second thought
Maybe they'd be surprised a bit that you don't know already your cheapest options, but that's all
There used to be legends about the thing called 'The Twist',where the bartender would swipe the counter, and squeeze the content of the rug into a glass - that came with a symbolic price
I doubt you could still get it, even if it ever existed
I did not work in a bar, however I have worked in many other places where I served/sold things
I dont really give a shit about what you ask for, I just want to serve you as fast as possible
usually, the first year of studying history is just ancient cultures
i believe we start off with sumer and those stuff, a little bit of india and china, most focused on religion, egypt a bit more than the previous ones
all these wraps up in like a month or two
im sure they've mentioned a few others but first, im not too sure about my english when it comes to ancient cultures and second, im just not sure
and then obviously greek and roman history for the rest of the year, very in-depth
Mesopotamia, Egypt, Ancient Greece, Persians, Macedonia, Phonecia, Assyria, Judea, Rome, China
Greece and Rome is discussed in great detail, several weeks spent learning on them, the rest are usually only talked about for one class or two, maybe even less
Those civilizations who're mentioned but not taught too deeply about; Japan, Mesoamericans and various important tribes all across Europe/Asia
They are sorta just mentioned that they existed for a long time but nothing too concrete is said about them
\>  i believe we start off with sumer and those stuff
I think history classes start from the homo erectus and their friends, but anyway
Phoenician alphabet is surely mentioned, too
If I would have to say one, then it might be Ireland
I'm just simply not interested
That's really weird
I never in my life heard anyone refer to Orbán as mister
Even the pain in the ass hard line conservatives call him just Orbán.
You see, I'm neither really sociable nor a lover of whiskey, sadly
Castles might be interesting, though
Ofcourse, it just simply falls behind in priority
In Hungarian we say "isten háta mögött"-behind gods back
We used to but now just refer to Moscow
Some phrases:
“Isten háta mögött” - Behind God’s back
“A halál faszán” - On death’s dick
“Kinn a francban” - Out in the heck
There are also some imaginary generic village names originating from taxi drivers I believe
Further than the Glass-mountain
Further than where the deaf-tailed pig dugs
Further then the "óperenciás"-sea
Folk Tales usually starts with theese senteces, some people use theese in the colloquial as well
Or a halál faszán which is much more vulgar and it means "on the dick of death"
I'd check the relevant laws first, nonexistence might not be a valid reason to stop paying
Nothing
I'm shocked
We didn't even hear about the one in Netherlands
no, but i saw it on 4chan
Just have a pack of cigs or 200HUF on you and youll be fine
>Only pistols and non-automatic guns are allowed
...allowing fully automatic guns is pretty pointless
As their utilization requires IMMENSE ammounts of training - which is why almost all armies reserve them for specialist units, and use semi automatic rifles with reduced propellant, called "assault rifles".
Are gun ranges allowed to keep full auto stuff and the like in Litvania too
Here in Hungary private citizens cannot have that, but you can shoot it at a range if the range has it
>Also, in Austria every unblemished adult person can own guns for self defence
**Thats unheard of, in most European countries
The Checz guys said the exact same thing
>Militaries generally don't use reduced propellant either
NATO loads are pretty high compared to most civilian loads
NATO militaries use the 5,56x45mm cartridge which is a "intermediate cartridge".
Thats an intermediat power cartridge, lexactly like the ones used in the east for teh AK family of rifles
Intermediate in the sense that its not a full powered rifle cartridge
Which is why something like an M16 is MUCH easier to control something like a fallschirmjägergewehr
Reduced recoil is great when you need to hit stuff
&#x200B;
>Almost all armies issue "select fire" rifles to general infanterists
Select fire means, you can switch between full-auto and semi-auto
I meant that operating procedures tend to strongly discourage utilizing the full-auto function even when present
As its more often than not results in wasting ammunition
This is not an issue if you are chivalriously fighting an insurgency from a postion of power, and you need supressive power to reduce the number of deaths on all sides
However its a very ineffective tactic if you want to achieve an objective
As all parties hunkering down to be protected from the blind "spray and pray" method is not exactly conducive to capturing objectives or movement in general
&#x200B;
>Which armies are you talking about
Almost all armies stopped issuing submachineguns / machine pistols outside specialist units
And now even the last refuge of these weapons - outside specialist units - is disappearing due to PDWs
We also have a legal category that allows owning guns for self defense
We had it even in the old commie days
But the "tradtion" was back then to only issue such permits for politicans and judges
And that tradition is with us even today
So in principle you can own guns for self defense
However in practice you wont get a permit
Again in theory it should be automatically issued, unless there are extenuating circumstances like prior criminal record ...etc
However police can came up with excuses, up to but not limited to "we can adequatly assure protection without issuing permit".
Our word for *pattern* comes from the Sami language
A linguist called János Sajnovics studies the Finno-ugric connection when he stumbled upon the word *minta*. He though it was an ancient Finno-ugric word as in Hungarian minta can be constructed as "mint a", meaning "like a [something]", a perfect word to represent "pattern".
In reality, "minta" came to Sami from the Norwegian "mynte", which in turn has a latin origin
You can find it in English too, in coin *mint*ing
The word "kocsi" is the slangish way of saying car over here
Why, you ask
Simple
The first cars were manufactured in the town of Kocs
In Hungarian, putting an -i to something means that its from there
Thus, people started calling them "the things from Kocs"
We have to learn a lot, which is impossible for some people
Not just every movement, person and date in Hungarian history, but also how the Athenian democracy worked, how ancient Greece came to be, what happened to it until the Roman conquest, it's internal and external relations, the life and campaigns of Alexander the Great etc etc
And it's just a tiny fraction of the expected knowledge
You have to learn everything twice
Elementary school takes 8 years (from age 6 to age 15-ish), High School (we call it Middle school) takes 4 years
You had your first history class in 5th class, beginning from the Stone Age until the fall of Rome
Same as the Highschool one, but with less not-so-significant things
Then you roll into Highschool and have to relearn everything, but with more stuff
Roman Republic internal structure, How did the Macedon Phalanx worked, Charlemagne, Colonization around the world, slavery, American Independence War and the Civil War, every fkin war in Europe, Kings, philosophers, statesmans, warlords, generals, members of the clergy, artists, admirals, politicians in Europe and in sometimes in the USA too, Opium wars, every single theatre of the WW2 with battles, dates and generals, you have to compare different dictatorships and political systems etc etc
And oh boy things can be difficult for someone who is uninterested in history
In the final exam of advanced history class I had to write a test, a short essay about fascist and nazi propaganda machine (half a page), a long essay about something I don't remember (at least one page), and a complex essay about the Chinese political system, internal and external relations, and wars from the mid 19th century to 1990
The test had questions about the bible, the first king of Hungary and his laws, the reformation, Soviet propaganda posters, the first years of Austria-Hungary, the interwar period, the Islam and it's origins, the Reformation, Hungarian domestic politics in the late 19th century, the Aftermath of WW1 around the globe and the stock market crash of 1929
And it was considered as an easy exam
And this is just History classes
Our system needs a massive rework, it just doesn't work
We not only learn the history of Hungary, but a LOT of world history, i would say more than half of the time is spent learning about other stuff
Of course once we have our country to talk about, onwards most of the time is spent learning about local event as opposed to whats going on in china in similar detail
At the end of the day the goal of teaching history in state sponsored education is always the same
To encourage the growth of nationalist/patriotic sentiment and blind fanaticism towards your country
Stuff that is contrary to this goal is simply omitted from the curriculum
We have 12 years of pre-university education
If you go to a bilingual secondary school, it is one more year (starts with a year of intensive language education)
You can start secondary school after grade 4, grade 6, and grade 8 (the latter is the most common option
We start primary school at 6/7 years, so this means that you go to university at around 18-20 years old, depending on your birthday and which education model you choose
Education is compulsory until age 16 (used to be 18, changed a few years ago)
Pre-Kindergarden (optional): 1-2 yrs
Kindergarden: 3-4 yrs
Elementary school: 8 yrs
High/Middle/Gymnasium: 4-6 yrs
University: 4(-5) yrs
So I'll go to university at around the age of 20
Also, H/M/G can last up to 6 yrs because at the start you may have a NyEK (Nyelvi ElőKészítő) year which focuses on the language you already know (usually English) and your second language that you just started (German, Russian, French etc)
Also at the end you might get another year, if you're leaning a profession
If your parents decide you can stay an extra year in kindergarden
>Because it *is* really short
I think this is most heavily felt in math, where you just do not learn everything you'd need to know to start studying at a university in that direction anymore because the courses in the 13th year are missing
That isn't really the case - Oberstufe is 3 years, whether you are studying in the 8-year (G8) or the 9-year (G9) system
The extra year is inserted between year 5 and 9
(At least, that's the case in Hesse - it might be different in other states
And you wouldn't learn more stuff in that time
It just makes you learn the same stuff more slowly, which is good for bad students, but boringly unchallenging for good students
>  In my opinion it’s awful and Catalonia should be allowed an official referendum on their independence like Scotland was
Some other EU countries would never let it happen because they are afraid of similar referendums happening to them
I was born in a village orginally called Ötházhuta
It means something like Fivehomefurnace in English
And the reason they called it this way
Well it explains itself
Back in the 18th century 5 families founded the village, they lived in 5 houses and their profession was glassmith
The descendants of those families are still live in that village
Székesfehérvár - Seated White Fort
"White Fort" because it already had stone walls in an era, when wooden and earth fortifications were much more common in Hungary(10th century)
It was one of the first Hungarian cities, founded by Prince Géza, the father of our first king, Saint Stephen
"Seated" because it served as the first Capital of the country until the mid-12th century and as the exclusive coronation city until the mid-16th century
Falu means village in Hungarian, but I doubt there’d be any relation (at least for this word, that is)
Doesn't that mean spiders, too
Well, I'm currently learning Dutch and it's apparently the same there
Corvinus University in Budapest, Eötvös Loránd University(also in Budapest), and the University of Szeged
We have a half-man, half-fish legendary creature: _Istók Hany_.
He was a boy who was found in the vast swamp of Hanság (hence his name)
But his skin was greenish, he had scales and webbings
He couldn't speak, he rather produced gargling sounds, and didn't like to wear clothes
He was christianed and taken to the court of the local landlord
He grew up there, and fitted in more or less
His only friend was the daughter of the landlord, and he fell in love with her
On the day of the girl's wedding (with a normal human), he wanted to show his love, and brought a huge basket full of frogs
He poured it onto the table, all the guests were frightened and disgusted
He was very much scolded and beaten, even the girl was angry at him
After that, in great sorrow, he vanished, and nobody ever saw him again
I know this is not the same vodník like in _Rusalka_, but this is the closest we have
Superbad
Buying booze not gonna make you cool in eastern europe
You just walk in to the nearest grocery store and if youre past 14 you are good to go
Since different pricing and quality vexes so many people in Eastern Europe, food regulations
But that would mean giving up rights for a centralized institution and legislation, and the complainers hate that idea as well
It was made obligatory in Hungary in the recent years
In many countries you always have to drive with headlights on
We've got the same in Hungary
You roll them in roasted bread crumbs once cooked
My favourite childhood food with some powdered sugar and ground cinnamon on the top
Fisherman's soup recipes (what fish do you use
is there pasta in it
what kind of pasta
etc) definitely divide the country into at least 3 big groups and dozens of subgroups
That wether saying the accusative form of motor[motorbike/engine] as "motrot" is correct or not
Who even puts pasta in Fisherman's soup
Then there's the fourth group, who do not eat halászlé at all
It’s even more obscure that this was what hacking originally meant
The Netherlands
I love their architecture, their cities, their canals, their funny language and I love their open society
I wouldn't oppose it, but that would mean eroding some of the nation state mindset, which is an extremely touchy subject
This is the version I learned:
Fej, vállak, térd és talp; térd és talp
Fej, vállak, térd és talp, térd és talp
Szemek és fülek és orr és száj.
Fej, vállak, térd és talp; térd és talp
"Talp" is the side of the foot that touches the ground, I think the lady who taught us this just wanted it to sound better, might be "láb" (=leg) originally
The other part mean the same
EDIT: Actually, nose comes before the mouth here
I’ve never seen, heard or read that this existed in Hungarian
Clearly I mist have missed out on this as a child
[Viktor Orbán] or [Mátyás Rákosi]
Edit: Also [Béla Kun]
Well this is quite controversial over here
Orbán being disgraced is unfortunately just wishful thinking
He's still one of the most popular politicians in the country, no matter how much I and others want this not to be the case
Doesn't he basically have a cult on the right
In Hungary it's the original: rock paper scissors(kõ papír olló)
You forgot ceruza(pencil), faragó(sharpener) and vulkánkitörés(vulkanic eruption)
No idea what exactly the pencil and sharpener do, but the vulcanic eruption beats them all
About 210€ for my mom, my stepdad, and myself for a whole month
My mom cooks usually, sometimes I do so, and it involves breakfasts, lunches and dinners as well
Sometimes +/-10€ occasionally for pizza or something like that
The national average was 67
46€/month in 2017
That seems frighteningly low to me, I spend about 200€/month on food -- granted, I don't grow my own crops, live in a well-off household and eat healthily
I see soo few hungarians here
Same
Dunno why
Turns out people in the USA don't learn about the cold war
Yugoslavia was
I know you don't, I just heard some worrying things about your education system both from Americans and from classmates who were there as exchange students, so I dared presume history teaching isn't exactly great there
I was generalising a bit too much though, so I'm sorry
Yeah, you're right
I mean, for a brief time it was
I think it greatly depends on the teacher
I was fortunate enough to have had a great history teacher in high school
But I think the topics covered are also important, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that history teaching in the USA is too America-centered
It was different in every country
I grew up in Hungary and had a very peaceful childhood
We had everything we needed, middle class family, my mother did not work because I had two siblings, too
Went to the playground every day it was fun all the time, then went to school where we were required to be pioneers, sort of young communists with red scarf, bud did not wear it every day only at special events
It was known not to be allowed to talk about the revolution of 1956 or press freedom
I watched the news with my parents and it was always the same boring shit to me, bald fat old men in grey suits talking nonsense
When I became a teenager we started to long for western stuff like coca cola in a can or milka and stuff like that
But we knew about all the other stuff that was important like Modern Talking or Starsky and Hutch
My parents were in Vienna in the eighties and it was like a paradise to them
I was shortly in West-Berlin, like in heaven
We had good books, films, sports
Not everything was politics
As the end of 80´s came closer my parents got more and more nervous
2 years after the iron courains fall my dad got laid off
That´s how I anticipated it
Even though I did not live under the dictatorship I have heard many things about it
It was basicly a "soft or goulash dictatorship", it means that they bough the peace with welfare acts
Generally speaking we had it way better than our neighbours and therefore many people would like to go back especially with that terrible governments we had in the 1990s. But still it was a dictatorship even at the very end and people were often imprisoned and beaten for speaking
It has a certain nostalgia since in the 1990s we had a sort of "great depression" with GDP falling 20% and people saw Kádár's area as the "good old days"
Yes that was it
Thanks
I was in Romania before 1989
It was indeed horrible for both Hungarians and Romanians there
That kind of oppression is absolutely unimaginable for people born after the 80´s
&#x200B;
And yes, you´re right about Gulyás communism
It was all financed from credits from the west so that 1956 doesn´t happen again
Important are here the cans
We had bottles, too
I agree with you, but I would not call the late Kádár era as strictly planned economy, after the New Economical Mechanism (1968) it was rather a mixture
An economical system that still socialist and therefore not working but a bit more functional than other Eastern block countries
...not that we do have huge indoors unemployment (thanks to pointless state financed hobby projects, and social aid getting transformed into piss poorly paid hard physical labour - in the dig up a hole, to have something to fill in tomorrow, line of tradition), bloated administration, rampant theft, and corruption now that communism "ended".
All in all, nothing changed but the names of the rogues on the top
I mean, if you seen the anime titled black lagoon, and recall the self styled "vampire twins" well, they are based on romanian orphanages
Or just read up on bucharest progrom, and realize that the Iron Guard (the political party responsibld for the whole shebang) got incorporated into the red secret services
(hanging 5 year old kids on meathooks in butcher factories and raping them, was a tad bit excessive even by waffen SS standards - but according to the actions of commhnist romanian leadership, the action was fine, only they did it on the "wrong target" a mistake they were willing zo overlook)
Yes omg there was this really good Romanian film about it I saw ten years ago
>But only a fool can say that we lived better in yugoslavia than now
You are in denial
I hope you do relize that pretty much everone lives better now than back then
The information revolution played a large part in that
It allows stuff like not needing a person to manually connect landlines to call up your relatives (with the need to pay him included in the prices)
Or that noone does real prototyping, i mean to test stuff, its done with software based finite element modelling, cfd
etc
and noone needs to keep a small army of drawers to allow production
There is no way to have the features in your products at current prices without said tech
No matter the ideology, it simply didnt exist neither here neither in the west
>Yugoslavia could not compare in any way to the west
Depending on the part of west
Ireland during the Troubles, Italy during the Years of Lead , or francoist spain was a worse place to live
Naturally in non-planned economies you had more variety in products, at the price of stuff like US " health care system" & "education system" - which are dirty commie things to have
And while in the east you had corruption (due to unchecked government power, why not sell out after all
), in the west you had crime waves facilitated to create untraceable credits for the secret services
And stuff like decades long experiments on the effects of syphilis, or meth on random citizens
And of course you could look at places like Argentina, which was at the life quality of Germany or Uk if they skipped the wars, which got completely and utterly fucked due to being the US's backyard, the same way Romania & Albania were the USSR's backyard
One of my favourite hungarian idiom is "To act like he/she shat the spanish wax" (úgy viselkedik mintha ő szarta volna a spanyol viaszt) it means acting all proud and arrogant even tough achieving nothing/or completing something very trivial
Or "to beat the stinging nettle with someone else's dick" (más faszával veri a csilánt) meaning to speak on other's behalf/do something that endangers them but not you
Or when somebody stands between you and the object that you want to watch(ie
TV) you can tell them "your father wasn't a glassman/glassmaker" implying that they in fact cannot be seen trough
And there is a lot more
These are from the tip of my tongue
You can't even really have conversation in English in the countryside of Hungary
(Maybe with young people)
Or else you'll be welcomed with people speaking Hungarian loudly and articulating hard in an attempt to make you understand it
As a Hungarian basically only to Transylvania
Besides ghat, Noone speaks this weird language
A lot of places in Slovakia, Romania and Serbia are fine in that respect
Even if the other side doesn't really speak Hungarian, most of the time, they know some certain keywords, which help a lot
Otherwise, German works quite well in Germanic countries (sans UK), while most Slavs can understand you if you speak in Russian to them
Lmao
You can't change it
It's just not goint to happen
And I assume that you're more of a "jány" than a "lány" lmao
Not the person you asked, but to add some anecdata, I stayed in Subotica/Szabadka, Serbia for around a month once and heard maybe one Hungarian speaker
Maybe
On the other hand, years ago, I often went just over the border to Slovakia and found Hungarian speakers fairly easily
In parts of Transylvania, though, you don't even have to search for them; they're everywhere
Fun-fact, there is a sizeable amount of people who believe the whole thing is made up by the Austrians as sort of a propaganda to let us believe we are lesser people
Many people also believe there is more similarity in turkish languages than in Finnish and Hungarian, Turkish people are looking at us as brothers
Well, some of them
That's basically a "lány" in a dialect that generally old people/villagers use
My grandma would probably call you "a jány" I assumed that so does your SO's granny
*jány*, *lyány*, *leány* and *lány* are all variants of the same word
standard hungarian only uses the last one, but there are various dialects which might use the others
I live in Kőszeg, Hungary, about five minutes away from the Austrian border
Ima tell you, it's like there's not even a border
You don't need any papers, no slowing down, it's like you're not even leaving the country, but you know you're in Austria because the roads are better
Although there is a checkpoint, you very rarely get checked, only if you're suspicious (like you have a body in the trunk, or something similar)
Went to austria from hungary during the immigration crisis
There was a small stop with a police officer
We only needed to prove him we are eu citizens, after that we continued our journey
Lasted 3 mins or less
Every other occasion there was 0 border control, not even a slowdown
The border with Slovakia is the Danube
There is a bridge
It's like any other bridge, except it says the other side is Slovakia
There is a checkpoint to Austria, but nothing really happens there
>Schengen allows you to do a lot of things which would be harder or even impossible to do in other countries, like
>Work in country a and live in country b, as living in country b is cheaper
>Buy groceries in another country
>Take a day trip to another country
>etc
Depends
Nordic countries managed to do it fine
Same with Hungary & Croatia (i am unsure about the living & working part, but plenty people done the latter for a long time, as passport is not needed - there is also a very nice restaurant just on the other side of the border close to my hometown)
When I went to Austria a few years ago we didn't even have to stop
All we noticed is that our mobile data is gone because roaming wasn't turned on

HAHAHAHA HUNGARY = HUNGRY HAHAHAHAHA SO FUNNY
I live in Belgium for 10 years now
I understand
Let me give you an example
Last year they have renovated the pavement in front of the house and they put some plants next to the road
So that the plants start to grow, the local commune ordered watering the young plants every week on Saturday
Now it was raining heavily twice, but they still came and watered the plant
r/fosttalicska in a nutshell
I mean we honestly are not even really aware of it, so we can’t really hate it
Can you tell us some jokes about us
Mostly about the Scots being tight and drunk
Adjonisten Fostársam
Son to his father:
-I saved a pound by running next to the tram
(slaps the kid)
-You could save ten if you'd run next to a taxi
21-22°C right now
Under 20° it would be a bit cold
5C/74F
Below 20C/68F would be cool/cold if I use the two words synonymously
0°C. The whole house is around that temperature (maybe 1-1
5°C colder at the entrance or the kitchen), as all the doors are open
What kind of bullshit law is that
There'd be a revolt here if they tried to pass something like that
Is it still the norm to not install any heating and have the crappiest insulation for flats in Portugal
When I was visiting friends during the winter, I was freezing my ass off and they were asking where's my thick sweater to wear indoors, lol
But the building looked like it was at least 50 years old
Because there are probably a lot of American lurkers in this sub
The legendary Dutch cheapness, lol
Not related, but one of my favourite new word is 'egérmozi' (mouse cinema), means watching movie/tv on a phone
Interesting, I haven't heard that one yet
I'm a night owl and my hobby is taking long walks at night
The city I was currently at never stopped me here in Hungary
Well now it isn't (national mandatory curfew after 20:00)
Apart from that it's pretty safe except some minor parts where \*certain\* people live
I used to go for a longer walk every day just to get refreshed
Why tho
Can you tell me exactly which subareas of Copenhagen are we talking about
Hopefully I will study at DTU from September so I'm interested in Copenhagen
Back in the middle ages the King of Hungary was coronated in my city
The Diet of Hungary was held in my hometown in 1708
And also Saint Elisabeth is claimed to be born here as well
My hometown was the HQ of Horthy after he left Szeged with the National Army
Yes, yes it is
The coronations only stopped being here when the Turks took over
Nono, it's Székesfehérvár, before the 16
Century all but two hungarian Kings were crowned in the basilica
Hungarian word on the left with its meaning on the right:
"Hold" = moon
"Nap" = sun (or day)
"Toll" = pen (or feather)
"Eleven" = lively
"Part" = shore
"Lap" = sheet of paper
'Here' means testicle in Hungarian
One of my first big language shocks was when Israeli relatives visited my family like ten or so years ago, with two little kids
Who, being little kids, made a lot of noise, prompting their mom to repeatedly tell them "dai" (די, "enough")
I didn't know a lick of Hebrew, so I was quite shocked that she was telling her kids to die over a little noise
Hold means Moon in Hungarian
Not any that I can think of right now, but
Cár instead of car would be 'tsar'
Tó instead of to would be 'lake'
Same
They are rare, but they are there:P
Don't climb on the statues
Please
> Just only be yourself and act decent then everything is fine
That is a contradiction at many people
I just ended my inter-national relationship 2 days ago and this question comes up :((
We do two
One for each cheek
just like in hungary :)
Europe is Paris, Rome and Amsterdam
When I went to Mexico, some dude believed that all Europeans are blonde with blue eyes
I asked him if the Spaniards are like that and he told me that it's because of the Arabs, otherwise they'd be all blonde with blue eyes too
I was speechless
Seriously this
I mean we do the kiss on the cheek greeting here, but that's only for family and close friends at best
Also a kiss on the cheek being so scandalous for Americans is just mind boggling
i mean the godless part is mainly true fortunately
I purchased two in a market in Bucharest, they are good housewives
Marxist construct with dedicated places for business lobby, good one
In no god we trust
In Budapest there are very differently priced housing units based on location
For that much you can buy a 65m^2 flat with panorama and a huge balcony on Gellért Hill,  same sized flat in an inner district or a 550m^2 house with huge garden in an outer district
Ah, a fellow Hungarian
How are you man
We call it a shell-toad as well, "teknősbéka"
There are some of these in hungarian as well
Wolf is "farkas" (literally "one with a tail"), and stag is "szarvas" (literally "one with horns")
The widely accepted theory is that this is due to the nomadic origin og the hungarians, as our ancestors probably held these animals in high regard, and thought it blasphemous to refer to them by their "true" name, so instead they just described them
Dehogy, mindent a saját nyelvünkön írunk, aztán majd a reddit app lefordítja nekünk angolra

Genau richtig gemacht
In Hungary, we have “földszint” which literally means ground level
Then above that, you have 1st floor and onwards
Strange exception is “szuterén”, which refers to apartments below ground floor (often with small windows and little light)
I see this is being used way too often here in Denmark, I assume because they are cheaper - hope a Dane can clarify that
Edit: We also have “magasföldszint” which translates to elevated ground floor
These are the ground floors which are placed a bit higher than the ground level but not high enough you’d designate them as a proper 1st floor
In hungary the first floor is the one above street level, in elevators the street level floor is usually 0 or F (földszint)
In slovakia the first floor is also the one above street level, the street level floor in elevators is marked sometimes 0 but mostly P (prízemie)
Hungary has a lot, but in my opinion the most famous is Rubik's cube
It was invented by Rubik Ernő a Hungarian sculpture/toy designer
But Hungarians invented dynamo, telephone exchange and ballpoint pen too
Rubic's Cube
The  ballpoint pen, the rubiks cube, safety match, vitamin C, tungsten lamp, the first helicopter, telephone exchange
Source:
One Rubik Ernő invented the rubiks cube, the other designed glider planes, like the Góbé. They were father and son
Safety match (János Irinyi), nuclear bomb (Ede Teller), high-voltage three phase alternating current motors and generators for electric locomotives (Kálmán Kandó), Ford T-model (József Galamb), computer (János Neumann), holography (Dénes Gábor)
Some important ones
Well, Ányos Jedlik discovered it 5 years earlier, his only problem was that he didnt patent it
Siemens patented it after discovering it too
You're right, my bad
Sleep deprivation didn't help me yesterday
We have two cities called Dunaújváros (New Danube City) and Tiszaújváros (New Tisza City) on Hungary's two big rivers, the Danube and the Tisza
They were originally communist planned cities, and they were named
Sztálinváros (Stalin City) and Leninváros (Lenin City)
Hungary's counties' names usually don't make sense
But there's one county (Békés) which basically means 'Peaceful'
Looking forward to finding out exactly who voted for and against it
The official website of the EP does not have the results yet, at least as far as I can see
If anyone has the detailed information, don't hesitate to share
I hope that it will be implemented in a way that our anti-piracy laws are implemented
The law is technically there, but no one cares about its enforcement
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Otherwise we might see Youtube, Twitter, Twitch, and other services blocked in europe
YouTube already has automatic content filters
They are way ahead of the EU - in fact, those opposing the Copyright Directive often cited YouTube's content ID system as a deterrent
The same voters send the same people to the EP
National sovereignty in action
Yes, unfortunately
When net neutrality was enshrined, I thought we were on the right track
This is a huge step backwards
Thanks
So Fidesz, as expected, voted for it, as did one of our Socialists
Two of our S&D members as well as one Green and one independent voted against
Trust the government to be on the wrong side, of course
The automatic filters are too easy to fool
I doubt they would rely on it if they could go to court over its mistakes
They certainly won't MANUALLY filter every piece of content
That's impossible
I'm not sure what your point is here
They are both issues related to the concept of the free and open internet
In one of them, the EU made positive directives; in the other, it fucked up
Well, depends on how it's enforced and how hard they get punished for a violation
If the free uploads cause too much hassle and fines, they might lock it all down to pre-approved content (i.e professional studios and shows)
Or maybe ask for a "copyright deposit" for uploading
Who knows yet
I highly doubt we would get that far, though
I want to believe this would all be a technicality
Well some people do put ketchup (hell some heretics even put mustard) on their pizza, but its quiet uncommon
(If the thing can honestly qualify as pizza - my grandma makes magnificent meat pies however those are not "pizza" regardless of shape)
And now garlic oil on pizza is definietly not a thing here
However "Lángos" could qualify as the "hungarian pizza with the fruits fo the cow" - and thats eaten with garic oil pretty freqently
But
But think about the poor college kids living in dormitories, supported by their parents, who think that around €90 a MONTH is enough to eat well in the capital (Budapest)
(And saying things like you don't need to work, your job is to study, but when you want like €20 more, cuz the only things you can afford are ketchup pasta and mayo rice, they tell you to find a job
) Sorry for the rant
Tuna ain't cheap, at least not here in Hungary
Probably has something to do with diastance, and the fact that right now there are quots on fishing it, s it hs been fished into extinctin in the mediterranean, and the stock is slowly strting to replenish right now
Depends on the kind, you could go for the original, which is pretty much "garum - chinese edition"
Cons:  bad hospitals, bad roads, corrupt politicans, brainwashing propaganda, low wages, devolving economy,
Pros: Pálinka
Pros: good culture, good food, gorgeous girls
cons: wages, healthcare, education, thus a declining population, corruption, political based disagreements nearly always violent and disrespectful for the other side
Pros: Good food and drinks, beautiful landscapes
Cons: Toxic xenophobic old people and shitty politics
No, never heard about such, neither for legal abortions or having an abortion in general

A lot of "communist" song i learned as a child are pretty good song to sing
It’s definitely a heavy critique, but still patriotic - [DDT’s Rodina] (Motherland)
“How many years I’ve chewed, instead of bread, raw love
I love Bella Ciao, it's a great song with a lot if emotional background
Your flair says other wise
The first thing that came to my mind was the [red mud catastrophe] from 2010
It was one of the biggest industrial accident in Hungarian history, 10 people died, 150 other were injured and the environment was hurt deeply
People lost their loved ones, their houses, cars, everything
Looking back at the videos and the pictures about what happened is still so heartbreaking
Probably the "Toxic Red Spludge Spill" in 2010
october 04
You can still see the red lines on trees and some buildings
The world is full with red mud storage ponds, pools etc
It can happen at any time and happened before the hungarian disaster
I read an article, which I can't find right now for some reason, a year or so ago where a journalist with some scientists went down to the affected villages and took some water and soil samples and from what I can remember some of the results were still not great
This is the first I heard about this Molasses Flood, this sounds terrible too
In hungary, you'll mostly see it at tourist attractions, events and festivals
I love it, but people only eats it on vacations and stuff
Never known anyone who makes it at home for themselves
However, I can confirm we eat this really often
Well I don´t know if you´re aware of it, but we call Italians cat-eaters
I know we shouldn´t. I also think you don´t eat cats very often
I was pretty sure this dates way back
We have these:
If you sit on a chair at the corner of the table, you won't get married
If you step on someone's heels, you will live to see their wedding day
If your right hand is itching, you will receive money, but if your left hand is itching, you will lose or spend money
On new years day you have to eat lentils so that you will be rich throughout the new year, (lentils representing coins)
Do for this reason, during new years' lentils are cheap at the supermarket, a lot of people are buying it to make a vegetable stew out of it
If on St
Katherines day (25th of November) the weather is very cold, then Christmas will be warm and there will be no snow, and vice versa, if 25th of November has mild, warm weather, Christmas will be cold and snowy
You should never give a knife as a gift to someone
If you ask for medicine, and someone gives you a pill, you should not say thank you, because then the medicine will not work
If you spill some salt, there will be an argument or a fight in your home
Also:
The fights caused by spilling salt can be avoided if you throw a little behind your shoulder
If you hit your elbow, you'll have unexpected guests
If you give someone a wallet as a gift, you always have to put a little money in it - symbolizing that the wallet will never be empty
If your left eye is itching, you will laugh, but if your right eye is itching, you will cry
If your nose is itching, you will be angry soon
If you sneeze while speaking, it's a sign that you are saying the truth
If you kill a spider, you will have bad luck
On new years day you can ear pork since pigs rooting the luck, but you cannot eat poultry because they will fly away with your luck
If you are pointing at something or someone publicly, you will steal in the future
If a glass cracks by itself or a clock stops, someone will die
If swallows make nest under your roof, your hose will never burn down
If you and another person say the same thing at the same time (unintended), you both will be lucky
If someone has a hiccup, they are talked about someplace else
If you see someone dying in your dreams, they will have a long life, but if there's a bride in your dreams, someone will die
Didn't have folders either
If we are speaking notebooks,
red is squares (sciences)
blue is lines (humanities)
green is empty (arts or whatever, geometry for math, lots of drawing for biology, basically for subjects where you need to draw a lot)
pink is staff/stave (?) (music)
Those are all I've ever seen
We used to use
used (lol) books in the not so distant past, but now it's just as you described - new books every single year, sometimes all they change is just a few lines in some pages or slightly alter the order of the chapters, it's so stupid and wasteful
10 years ago I could use either the books I got from my siblings or get a used one for free from the library - often there were a more than dozen students listed as previous owners and the book was fine
Now you can't even use last years edition
The government has a monopoly on alcoholic drinks and cigarettes
Also the most popular TV channels and news outlets are owned or funded by the government
Unfortunately, none of that is unique to the Netherlands
It's a disease of neoliberalism
Well guys, the same thing goes for Hungary-Germany
German wages are way better, than Hungarian ones, let alone the livelihood
But sure, the neighbor's grass is always greener
Even little villages in Hungary
Well, I won't deny that the commenters of a specific subreddit are all in favour of more affordable housing
What I'm saying is that under the Thatcher/Reagan-type economic policies this sort of housing crisis is inevitable
If the market is not regulated in an effective way - and neocons/neolibs abhor all regulation that infringes on the ability to make tons of money - then it's very easy for investors to create artificial scarcity on the market, drive up the prices and cash in
That's not a big deal if they do it with, say, beach balls
If beach balls become unreasonably expensive because a few wealthy individuals/companies corner the market, that's no big deal because really, you don't need beach balls, just don't buy them
But you have to live SOMEWHERE, and your choices are limited by employment opportunities
I'm not sure what the sensible and effective regulations would be
Because - and here's my problem with blaming government limitations as you and neolibs tend to do - housing prices are skyrocketing pretty much everywhere, despite wildly differing rules and regulations
Average property prices in Budapest increased by 63% over the last four years
That's insane
Rent doubled over the last five years
Wages did not grow at a pace even remotely close to that
And we have a very different government than that of the Netherlands - what is common is the prevailing economic system
Regions which no longer belong to us have the best reputation, since they are idolised by nationalism
Otherwise, Győr-Moson-Sopron County is probably the most liked county in general
Compared to the rest of the country it's clean and wealthy
Lol, I kinda feel sad about this tho
Don't take it the wrong way, it's just that place is still so hungarian
People saying they don't wear any special clothes in -20 degrees only jeans and thsirt
And here I am wearing thighs under the jeans, 2 socks, winter boots, 3-4 layers of upper body clothing (under top, long sleeve shirt, light  sweater, then warm sweater), winter coats, scarf, hats, gloves even when it drops under 0 degrees lol
Though I'm not living in a northern country
Very rarely and mostly when it's only for my myself
Most of the time I use English because that's the used language anyway and I find myself speaking English more than my first language
English, except rant-style debug logs which are of course Hungarian
Both
Our business logic uses words that have no English counterpart, so most of the logic related stuffs are in Hungarian
Functions and methods are funnier, because they should be in English, but also should reflect the logic behind them, so mixed names are quite common
Purely architecture related things are strictly in English though
The nearest supermarket to my home is a Lidl (300 m)
I like it very much
The prices are OK, the staff is much more competent than in most supermarkets and hypermarkets
The quality is constantly high, the weeks about nations (like Greek/American/German/French etc
Food Weeks) are good; but the variety otherwise is very flat, it is very rare that they introduce a new product
They sell fresh produced baked goods
Most of our day to day shoppings are done there
Another competitor is Aldi (in some countries: Hofer)
There's an Aldi 1 km away
I go there sometimes, if I want to buy a specific product I can't buy in Lidl (like high quality chicken nuggets)
Sounds like the supermarket revolution was seen everywhere
Years ago, it was Interspar that was acceptable and Tesco & Lidl were really really bad and cheap
Now both turned around, I think it was Tesco first, and then Lidl&Aldi became quite frankly the most popular mid-size shop in Hungary
Everyone I know shops at Lidl, literally neighbours of mine are meeting at the closest Lidl when we come home from work
> sold goods in the boxes they came in just stacked up on the floor
they still sell stuff in their boxes here but I dont mind it at all
Their shops look clean and organised though
In Hungary Aldi & Lidl are basically the same, selling the same stuff
You've met some odd Hungarians if they declared it in such a nonnegotiable way
Sure, being friends with the same sex is more  common, but life doesn't filter out interesting people by sex, so if you do it willingly, that speaks of your own values rather than society's.
Funny you say that
I'm Hungarian, female,  lived here all my life, and I'm now having a serious clash of values about this exact same thing with one of my female friends, whose boyfriend also happens to be my friend and collegue
She got it into her head that (even though she trusts me, she says), that I'm basically a liability in her relationship and that makes her uncomfortable
Says it doesn't fit her "worldview" that her boyfriend considers me, a friend or any friend, just as important as his girlfriend
She then gave him some sort of ultimatum about “what's more important". They broke up just yesterday
I was honestly shocked by this "worldview" from the Middle Ages and how many people supported her in this conspiracy theory
We're in our twenties
Me and his boyfriend are village people, she and her rocket scientist "council" are from Budapest
I never encountered such a clash about something I considered normal in my life before
So yeah, it was shocking to me to realize how deep of a divide exists about this in my own society as well
Ehm
I’ve always had friends from the opposite gender since kindergarten and I didn’t get impression that we’ve had any kind of segregation, even guys who are into macho culture and conservative towards gender roles in my experience generally have female friends
As Hungarian I honestly can’t really relate to what you’ve described
As you wrote in one your comments, it might be age though
But honestly I’d considered this weird for people in their 40s-50s as well
My parents are that age also they literally grew up in bumfuck nowhere rural Hungary and even for them it’s totally normal and common to have opposite gendered friends
Only generation where I would consider this kind of segregation normal and nothing out of the ordinary is among people over 70
I am 19 years and Hungarian
I have many female friebds with whom I often go out
I call bs on what you have writteny at least in Budapest
I have female friends, but they are not going to do anything as often as the male ones
As every other Hungarian in this thread said, this is nonsense
Hungary is not like that at all, there's no strict segregation of the sexes
What
I mean how old are you and your friend group
In my circles in Budapest being above thirty it is and its always been normal to have friends from both gender since like elementary
As a Hungarian in Hungary, i have got friends from the opposite sex and i have never had any problem or confusion from it
Yeah, it's definitely her insecurities, but that doesn't explain why so many of her acquaintances fueled them further with that conservative BS
It's possible
Though I'm still leaning towards some cultural bubble effect that I haven't been aware of
99% of the time I just say "halló" and vary the tone depending on who the caller is
1% of the time, when it's a close friend, I say "ja
"/"yep
"/"mondjad
"\[tell me\], or one of the memes we have for phone calls
Weirdly, I cannot take myself seriously enough to do the "\[full name\]" thing
To me, it would sound
pretentious
halló, tessék
means 'hello,what' (but it's a very polite way of saying what(
i never say my full name if i'm being called, i wait for the other party to introduce themselves
also, i don't answer private numbers (if you don't want me to see your number, it cannot be that important)
Not while talking on the phone at least
You start a sentence with it tho - when you want the other person to pay attention
Something like 'hey' in "Hey, look at this
" or something
895 when we settled where we are, 1001 when the country was founded
As a settled state it was founded at AD 1000 or 1001
But our ancestors crossed the mountains around 895
Our first king was crowned in 1000, but Hungarian tribes lived in the Carphatian region for a time (and raided as much as we could)
What about the Wallachia, it was essentially a Romanian country, wasn't it
Did Slovenian national indenitiy was part of the "Spring of Nations", like the Croatian and Hungarian one
So what do you learn in history lessons
What about the Treaty of Verdun(843)
It essentially established East Francia, which later evolved to be Germany as a separate realm
>Scotland inherited England, not the other way round
You mean the King of Scotland inherited the throne of England, right
We "christianized" in 1001, so he's right
True enough I guess
I see, we don't learn much about Slovenia at school for some reason
Sure but they are still very close to us, we learn about Slovakia too and they aren't much bigger either
Sure, it wasn't ever part of it but we learn about all the countries in region (and in generally Europe)
Finally someone is aware of the concept of personal unions
That's the best tactic
We should try to adopt this
Why on Earth would I ever need drywalls
I think most extended families have someone with a car trailer, and it's easy to find one to rent
We have a „share“ system here, in the sense that every family has a member or knows someone who owns a van or a small truck (not a pickup) and when someone needs it, they ask for it for the day
But almost everything can get delivered, in many cases it’s even free, you rarely need a truck more than twice a year therefore
Dajka, dada or dadus
But these are old-fashioned
We took the english babysitter and use it more frequently
Bébicsősz
Translation would be something like "hayward of babies".
Also we use the hungarianized version of babysitter: *bébiszitter*.
Yes, back in elementary school we did sometimes
I remember cooking in Arts class in primary school
Although I think we only made three things, pancakes, waffles and grilled vegetables
More interestingly in the second half of primary school and then in secondary school, every year around the end of the school year, we made goulash in cauldrons/pots (bogrács) outside, over open fire
Two of the lunch ladies and the vice-headmaster were adjudicating them, although my class never won
We have that here at our school as well but i know its not a thing all over the country
Never heard of this

We already have an official holiday on the 15th so no, no such tradition exists here
It is very necessary to use the so called Flex (angle grinder) as early as possible on Sunday mornings
Or drill a hole into the wall, if you live in a flat (especially the socialist style with the thin walls), in the middle of the night
Only if its 2006 or older
> God damn it, how many pictures can one appartment hold
Not enough
I didn't know the expression "angle grinder" in English, so I had to look it up
It was an absolute surprise to me that Flex is one of the brands who sell this
We just use it as a common noun (like xerox or winchester in English)
I don't own one - according to the joke, I would be considered gay in the countryside
Hell yes
That goes without saying
This guy pictures
Like 10 minutes with car
In the past few weeks, it was quite simple
I only have to take one bus to get to my new university
It's at the edge of the city, so there's no jam either
While everyone tries to get to the centre, there's little to no traffic going in the opposite direction, so the bus is never late
Including the walk door-to-door, all of this takes max 40 minutes
Edit: Budapest, btw
7 minutes with bus + 10 minutes walk, or 30 minutes if I walk entirely
25 minutes walk or 15 mins by tram, but I usually walk
I really like Lydia (feminine) and Mateo (masculine)
There's Mateo in Hungarian as well (Máté) but that sounds lame compared to it
Bastian, i like german names
For male names, I would say Karl, Maximilian and Alexander are great
Japanese 夢 "yume", which literally means "dream"
Sergei, Boris, Igor, Nikolai, Aleksei, Vladimir, those are guys I would love to get drunk with
Hey, my name is Zoltán! I appreciate you liking my name
If i would have a son i would probably name him Felix it just sounds right
I'm not joking but it can be from 16 to 45
Is noone going to talk about the "after finishing the mandatory army at 20" part
We had a colony in a China as Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was a small part of a small city we got for taking part in the Opium wars
*Boxer Rebellion
My bad, I remember that it was the Second Opium War
Thanks
I think perhaps we can share that title together
Both were about screwing over China, minor mistake
It didn't happen to me, but I saw a video, where a traveller couple randomly met an old Hungarian man in a small village in Laos
Hungarians truly are everywhere
In blade runner a guy just goes "lófaszt" meaning horsedick
seeing hungarian anywhere outside of hungary is strange as hell
Mindenhol ottvannak de komolyan
Because of our prime minister's propaganda campaign most people abroad think that we are racists
It's not true at all, even the majority of his supporters aren't racists
"Up to 50% more just have the Soviet mentality of "we don't matter so why protest", "we don't care as long as we've got some food to eat", "it could've been worse" and "well, Putin might suck, but I get my news from TV and TV doesn't show any alternative, so I guess it doesn't exist"."
They are the true support and backbone of the system
Not the Putin-likers
I never associated bullfighting with Portugal
That's a Spanish thing in my mind
It's entirely true
It's not even taboo to be casually racist towards them if you're not a public figure
Don't worry, it's a good question
He doesn't really come off as racist in Hungary, according to his propaganda he's more like a protector of our culture and values
While I don't support him for many reasons I don't think he's actually a racist, more like an opportunist who sees that people can be manipulated by fear, especially those who live in rural areas as they haven't really encountered many foreigners
It's not a coincidence that he gets the fewest votes from the capital city
While I absolutely don't support him or his party I think this racism of his is a bit overplayed abroad
It's a bit more complicated than 50% of our country being racist
While his rhetorics do tend to attract racist voters, his propaganda campaign was very careful never to mention race or skin color, only culture and values
But his fear mongering wasn't the only reason why he got elected
There were many reasons why they won,  one of the main ones was probably the lack of a competent opposition
Before the election the opposition parties decided to work together to defeat Fidesz but their plan fell apart because they just couldn't work together
It was really painful to watch how childish they all acted while Fidesz was confident and looked competent
They also hold most of the popular media platforms in their hands so they can very easily manipulate the information that get to people online and offline
Also, I think the general population is not mature enough politically
This democracy thing is very new to our country, it's only been 30 years
Most people are used to a ruler, not a prime minister and Orbán gladly fills this role
I don't judge from the outside, the situation is same here: Hungary became a satellite state of Putin's Russia
We are Russia's brick inside the European Union
The similar mentality is dominant in Hungary - 1,5-2 millions of people love Orbán (still too much), but the "indifferent" (=cowardly) majority ensures that he will reign in Hungary until his death
In the communism, there were 200 thousand Soviet soldiers stationed in Hungary in order to keep us in the Warsaw Pact and the Eastern Bloc
Now, there is no outside force - Hungary becomes a dictatorship because of its own will - and sorry, I don't have anything against Russian people and I admire Russia's culture etc
- but today's Russia with Putin has a major role in this with the industrial manipulation, fake news factories
This is absolutely true
I know a lot of people who voted for him because other parties wanted to introduce stricter taxes
They also give lots of subsidies and help to young families
While some of them created more problems that they solved, people are afraid that others will revoke these policies
It's easy to judge but there are lots of families here that live off of 500-600 euros per month or even less, they can't afford to lose these benefits
You mean the American Budweiser or real Budvar
I am
Not really paying attention, it goes more like as a background music, but it is a tradition to watch

That's right
New Year's Frankfurter Würstl wouldn't be the same without it
When founded the Kingdom of Hungary was one of the most diverse country in Europe, it had many nationalities (Slovaks, Serbs, Romanians, Kuns, Besenyős,Hungarians) that lived together in harmony and coexistence was encouraged by the King
Our first King wrote in his teachings to his son: "For a country with one language and costumes is weak and frail"
This diversity helped a lot to catch up in technology to the Holy Roman Empire and later helped in the Hungarian renaissance (which was also the first one outside Italy)
We have a saying: "Hungary is bordered by itself". It originates from land being annexed by neighboring countries from all sides following the treaty of Trianon at the end of WW1, leaving Hungary the size of today
I just hate these types of currency conversions
If you go back far enough in history, you could say that this piece of wood was worth $10000000 in today's money
Like, please no
Prices fluctuated through history, and you just can't calculate the price difference caused by shortage and a lot of other factors
Also, medieval England had no market economy, you just can't compare prices within the two
It's apples and oranges imho
Then the victors of WW1 said screw that and merged 2/3rd of Hungary to the neighboring countries so we can have the rest all for ourselves
What you say is true, but that only started to happen later (mostly after the Arpad dynasty died out) and was caused by religious tensions
Also I would and that the Transylvanian Principality was one of the most tolerant country during the age of reformation even fighting against a Habsburgs on more then one occasion in religious conflicts
I think the conflicts in Transylvania only started when nationalism become a thing in both nations (so mostly in the 1830s) before that it was generally a serf-Lord conflict with Hungarian and Vlach serfs fighting against Hungarian and German nobels
Paprika in most foods
The lack of turó(cottage cheese) was/is a huge surprise for me when going abroad
Apfelschorle has became quite common in Hungary in the recent years
If you ask "almafröccs" (derived from the Austrian name variant Apfel g'spritzt), chances are very high the waiter/bartender will understand
In bars and restaurants, you will most likely get mixed on the spot from Cappy apple juice and mineral water, but you can buy it in Aldi already mixed together
I love that
Also, "normal" Spritzer (made from wine and sparkling water) have been extremely common and traditional in Hungary for more than a century
Even every mix ratio has an own name
I drink that all time when I go out
Women and women, men and women who know each other pretty well, greet themselves often this way
Interestingly, mostly pretty trashy men greet themselves this way (who tend be homophobic otherwise), but it's rather unusual
"Quark" is a staple of Hungarian cuisine
Literally one of the most common ingredients
Also savory, also sweet
Kifli is very common in Hungary too
And you call it kifli
That's the Hungarian word for it so I'm a bit surprised
We have it too(kifli), and I'm pretty sure, that many other neighbouring countries also have it
Even though u/Fehervari has already written it, I'd like to emphasize how common "rohlík" in Hungary is
Very
We just don't necessarily fill it with párek and sell it for 12 Kč.
Isn't that Mezzo Mix
It's disgusting
I have no idea why galette is not popular in other regions and countries too
It's so tasty and so convenient
In Hungary, it depends on the weather and the homeowner's attitude, if you keep your shoes on while visiting somebody's house
If the weather is dry (no mud etc), it's still polite to ask "Should I put my shoes off
" And then you'll get an honest answer like "Yes please" or "No, keep them on".
In winter you don't ask
It's not English :)
>"pula" means shortage
Yep, that will leave a mark
We consider it as a separate dairy product category
Like milk, cheese, cream etc
and _túró_ (quark)
What is the premium version of mixing 1 dl Fanta and 1 dl Coke together
It's not really a "dessert" you'd eat after a meal, but I'll still go with [chimney cakes]
While it technically originates from the Roman Empire, my favourite hungarian dessert is the [Palacsinta] I think some other european countries also have it, but it's the most popular here
lol
you can get them at Spar (grocery store) bakery here
Not sure if they are the same, but they look exactly alike
Fun fact: a descendant of Franz Sacher is Gábor Zacher
He is a semi-celebrity in Hungary, because he is a toxicologist (used to be chief physician of the emergency room of a main hospital, now he's an ambulance doctor), and he often speaks in the media in various health topics (especially drugs and dependancy)
He has a distinct style, he's well trusted and liked in Hungary
Some call him "the Hungarian Walter White". Here's his photo if you wonder why:
I think the main one is that Iranians are Arabic
Some people think even Turks are Arabs
Yep, or Turks or Mongolians
The problem is that you don't understand what you are talking about and you are very proud of it
Sultan is close to the title of emperor, but it bears no religious authority (that's the caliph) but has direct ownership of everything whithin its domain
A king is the crowned ruler of a land that constitutes a kingdom and has religious authority
The Wallachian viovode(duke) was a ruler of the blood, elected by the boyars of his land, himself a (for a time) despotic ruler with no religious authority (afaik), and thes later became vassals of the sultan
Quite common and preferred method of heating outside of dense residential areas in Hungary
It was certainly more tolerant than, say, contemporary France, evidenced by the ethnic/religious minorities *not* assimilating en masse
Tokyo

And if it counts, a city in South Sakhalin was called Toyohara in Japanese
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Yokohama, Suzuka, Fukushima and that's about it
For Hungary, it has to be [Korbuly Péter] he's insanely talented, pronounciation on point and his voice is amazing too
Most people know him from reading the staff that made the Hungarian dub of various movies and series
According to the measured popularity index: László Toroczkai
He is a far right, nationalistic politician
He was a prominent of the party _Jobbik_ ("The Right One") which used to be similar to the German AfD etc, so a newly founded party in the 2000s who represented the xenophobic, Romani-hating, anti LGBTQ etc share of the population
They became increasingly popular, in 2014 they were the greatest (not in quality) party in the opposition; they were thought authentic, since they had never been in the government and didn't have politicians from the socialastic era
Then, Jobbik shifted towards the centre, since Fidesz itself became the most chauvinistic, fascist party; some of the "old guard" left Jobbik and founded the new party _Mi Hazánk_ ("Our Homeland")
The only problem is that Mi Hazánk is actually operated by Fidesz, they clearly finance and control it (it was also the case in the earliest days of Jobbik one decade earlier, but they soon got more independent); Mi Hazánk claims to be in the opposition, but they support the worst, most controversial decisions of Fidesz blindly
So their prominent politicians can't really be called authentic and don't really have a fanbase: really patriotic people know that they are just puppets of Fidesz; only some lunatics still like them (of course, the backbone of the original fanbase of Jobbik was also consisted of idiots)
Why was he elected then
Is this his first term
A city mayor is elected directly, so people just have to vote for another candidate if they hate him so much
If the question is who gets the most hate it is Gyurcsány Ferenc and Orbán Viktor
They are the ex and the current prime ministers from opposite parties
They are both hated by the other side and blamed for a lot of things
They are both corrupt oligarchs and liars so they deserve it
I mean when we look at how many people like/dislike certain politicans on their own, I don't doubt that Toroczkai is going to be in the top3, but overall I think it has to be Orbán (if you're voting for the opposition) or Gyurcsány (if you're voting for Orbán, but he also gets hate from some opposition voters too, so
Okay, but Orbán is extremely popular
We who hate him are hating him with an extreme passion, but we're only a tiny fraction of the population
You say Bandić is the most hated
Something's not right
Well, my message to the indifferent is: behold the fate of Hungary
They are also the backbone of Orbán's support
I blame them more than the actual, blind fans
The fans don't know any better
But the apathetic could change the situation
Even if they are disillusioned with democracy, they will learn the hard way, that it's still better than a (semi-)dictatorship like in Hungary
A gay symbol
2020 just had to do it to you
Many felt it in Hungary as well, but the moving christmas decorations are nothing compared to what you have to go through right now
It was a gradual process, from the 1953 East German Monday protests to Poznan to the Hungarian Revolution, the Prague Spring, Gdansk, the Pan-European Picnic, Berlin Wall etc
Also the non-interventionist attitude of Gorbachev
János Kádár. Became the soviet puppet leader of Hungary after the revolution of 1956 was squashed by the Soviet Union
He was personally purged and tortured by the communist regime before, nevertheless he gladly reinstated the old authoctratic system when he got to be at the helm
Although after the act of amnesty he created the most liveable socialist state ever, so it's debatable
Szapolyai János/ John Zápolya
His personal ambitions and greed directly led to the tripartition of early-modern Hungary
The consequence of his actions were 200 years of constant warfare on Hungarian soil
Back in october we had mayor elections across the country
A week or two before the elections there was a video leaked of the mayor of Győr (one of our bigger cities)
He is a member of our ruling party, Fidesz, and was re-running for the position
He was an accomplished olimpic champion gymnast and has been in charge of the city since 2010
In the video he is shown balls-deep in some girl (he has a wife and kids btw) on a yacht with plenty of alcohol
Despite all of this, he STILL managed to win the elections and take the office once again
A month after winning he resigned
Further info: the "some girl" in question was a luxury prostitute who was hired at least partially with taxpayer money, along with five others, for basically a sex party of the mayor and some of his friends/associates
Cocaine was also consumed
Could have been worse
At least he is not a completely incompetent
Unlike the major of my hometown of 60
000
Who is now a minister of ...., and still micromanadges the city
Fighting away all competent businessmen who dont proverbially lick his arse hard enough - pushing away the best ones - meanwhile the other big city in my county managed to lobby out test road for self driving cars and 4G mobile services
Of course before him we had a major of what is today opposition who vetoed everything until he got an Audi A8 as his service vehicle
What about the crime scene investigators taking finger prints from wall stickers
He should have just refused to comment
Why bother, he won't become the king anyway
We also have strange pririties regarding football stadiums & hospitals
....however the highway toll collectors union being preferred over teachers (not automatizing toll collection) is nothing to scoff at
Good to see that the ex-eastern block still holds together
Even further info:
two of the girls were twins, and they later opened their wedding dress 'shop' in my city
with EU fundings
So your tax money, doesnt matter if you are Hungarian, German or Portugese
Thanks guys
Here you go
But be warned it isnt very pleasant
Mostly people not knowing some words
Either because they are only present in my dialect or because their dialect uses another word from the standard language
Some recipes that are made very differently but are called the same thing, like calling [filed cabbages with meatballs] [stuffed cabbages]
gyros in crescent
What are those words that people don’t know
Which part of the country are you from
I’m curious
Gyros with corn and cheese in Debrecen
Clearly you've never had gyros in lángos
As a Hungarian, I don't know what are you talking about
There is a standard dialect that is used in books, publications, news, tv, etc
Maybe the dialect of the capital city is closest to standard, but even there people don't follow it 100%.
The dialects don't really differ that much, only in pronunciations/accent, a few words and some grammatical structures
Probably the most different is the Székely and Csángó dialects
Since they were cut off from the rest of Hungarian speakers for a long time a lot of older words and expressions remained in their dialect, and they also adopted some words from Romanian
When speaking with people from different regions people try to use standard words instead of localized ones
The accent is harder to get rid of but poses no problem generally
How about it in Turkey
I would guess there are pretty big differences in dialects there
I'm from the east, near the border with Romania but currently I live in Budapest, the capital
Lots of regional words are adopted from other languages like Slovak, Serb, Romanian, German
However, sometimes regional words have older Hungarian roots, while the standard word is adopted
Like the standard word for corn is called kukorica, which comes from Serbo-Croatian, but where I came from we call it tengeri, which is a shortening of tengeri búza, meaning "wheat/grain from the sea".
Other times the same meaning had two words but only one is used now, but some regions kept the older one also
In my opinion most probably the two words had slightly different meanings but they merged into one and one of them stopped being used
For example aludni and hálni both mean to sleep
But hálni is not used anymore, only in compound words
Some words that are used where I'm from but not generally all around the country: vinete for padlizsán (eggplant), ler for sütő (oven), paszuly for bab (bean), ruca for kacsa (duck), oszt for aztán (then), górni for dobni (to throw), krumpli for burgonya (potatoes), köszméte for egres (gooseberry)
Most of the differences come from accent/pronunciation: jau for jó (good), pinz for pénz (money), pad for padlás (attic), vóut for volt (was), szauda/szolda for szóda (soda), otthol for otthon (at home)
with rice
Gyros with French salad
In the old Kőbánya-Kispest metro station
Igen, őszintén nem tudom mi rá a jó angol szó, eddig sosem jutott eszembe
A colleague of me is also from east, but the Ukranian border
My favorites from his words are:
- just "mag" for sunflower seeds
- "gömb" (sphere) as ice cream "gombóc"
I have a friend who eats it with pasta
Oh yes, we use those too
I will never get used to gombóc lol
It's cool how much of a cultural exchange zone Transylvania is
Ja, jó. Ha az ételt nem értenéd, akkor nézz szét Nyíregyházán (jó tudom Izlandról nincs olyan közel)
I don't like football
I rarely ever drink
I'm not complaining about my problems as often
Even though I'm not as open minded as the average westerner, but I'm still noticeably more open than the national average
Hungarian folk music makes me fucking cringe
I enjoy Romanian national songs e.g: Drum bun, Traiasca Romania, the anthem etc
I find the history of other countries more interesting than ours (but that might be because having learnt it in school I take it for granted)
I think pálinka is an inherently mediocre spirit and it's most perfect iterations are only okay at best
But hey, at least it's not borovička, which is something
I hope you still eat mici on May 1st
Hello there fellow outcast :)
If you think it's vodka you are going to have a bad time when you first drink it
It's a fruit brandy
'Being a Scot' means the person is a cheapskate
"Ez nekem kínai
" = "This is Chinese to me"
Meaning: I don't understand this at all
"Ég mint a reichstag" "he is (his face) burning like the Reichstag" when someone is feeling so embaressed that his face starts turning red
We have the tatars saying in Hungary too
We have the Scottish one in Hungary as well
Yeah I thought bratanki was brothers
Yeah, we sometimes say "I´m going to watch Swedish girls in Tirol now
Sadly, being racist isn't generally stigmatized, especially against gypsies
...wait until you see leader of the communist east tongue kissing for a greeting
I tend to say that tax evasion is the hungarian national sport
Since 1848 - as after the revolution got beaten, people didn't really want to contribute for the cause of our austrian overlords, and the attitude stuck
I would say that is not unusual here either - its not 70% but not uncommon either
We usually wear swimsuits or a towel
Some places even kick you out if you are going in nude
Not really a documentary, but
The Üvegtigis films (Glass tiger) are really good at showing the Hungarian reality
Hungarian mentality, humor, places, everything
It has no epic cinematography, or even a green screen, only some guys drinking and talking and laughing
But that's all that matters
Here's the first movie;
Yeah, not really a documentary
Just a bunch of funny drunk guys in a village trying to run a roadside buffet
I can't think of a documentary right now but Hungary's history goes back over a 1000 proud years
The movie Magyar Vandor does a decent job at history:
On easter men dress up nicely and visit every female relative and friend, and "sprinkle" them with rose water or perfume
As a reward women give us easter eggs, and young boys get money from relatives
Traditionally men used to splash women with a bucket of water
&#x200B;
Edit: also, Santa comes on Saint Nicholas day (December 6), not on Christmas
Santa usually gives minor presents like sweets, oranges, a small toy, while on Christmas it's Jesus that brings the presents
We keep a 1000 year old severed hand in a church in the capital
Once a year it's being carried around in a fancy march
It's going to happen in 5days
Hungary here
We clap for EVERY performance in a theater, no matter what quality it was
Clapping is not the reward for a good performance or piece of theatrics, it's a MUST
And the actors HAVE to be recalled by sustained applause exactly three times, not more, not less
Also, old people still clap when a plane lands
We hungarians do this too
But we only drench friends, family and schoolmates
And nowadays we only use perfume or sparkling water
We use buckets less
In Hungary if you are a good child you get presents from Santa on Saint Nicholas day
If you are bad you get a piece of coal from the Krampusz or he takes you away
When I was a kid our school always had a Santa and a Krampusz come to our class, Santa always chased the Krampusz away and gave us some sweets
There was a publicity stunt of a commercial channel that they declared already in autumn that they were _not_ going to air Home Alone that year
Of course it caused a huge uproar (as they planned), then they issued the slogan "No christmas without Kevin
" and did air it as usual
I can't decide if this sketch is sadder or creepier
Thanks, I corrected it
Yep, [I think it's the same thing]
This looks like the Kartoffelkönig
I imagine this like a good excuse to have a dinner with your neighbours
Which famous historical figure from your country was actually a bad person
For Hungary it would most likely be the Horthy government and exspecially Kuno Klebersberg, he is famous for the school reform (what is also controversial since the actually important reform was already done) but he was very heavily antisemitic
Franz Ferdinand
Everyone keeps talking about how he wanted to reform Austria-Hungary into the United States of Greater Austria, and bring equality to all the people of the monarchy, while in reality, he dropped such ideas quite early (around 1903, I think)
In the first place, as a true neo-absolutist, his only goal was to increase his power and have himself be called Emperor in all of his empire
He was vehemently anti-Hungarian and hated the Slavs only a little bit less ( I don't know how he sorted that out given his wife was Czech) . Although advocated for good relations with Russia, he did so only in reactionary spite to prevent the lower classes from taking power
His grim, uncompromising personality and disgusting hunting habits didn't make him anymore sympathetic either
If his death wouldn't have sparked the Great War, it would've been one of the luckiest incidents of the Danubian Monarchy
But still pretty efficient
This was underhanded
I think it is pretty known he was a baaad guy
But at least you guys have some cool architecture from his time
I think most rulers converted to protestantism for the land
Really
We only learn about him that how he supported the estern-European democracies
Jelacic ban (sorry for misspelling) is pretty known to Hungary
We learn that the Hungarian government offered Croatia autonomy and independence (but only after the war is won)
And that he refused and sided the the Emperor Anti-croatian sentiment is somewhat true, there were elements in the Hungarian parlament that wanted to keep Hungarian as the only language of the Kingdom of Hungary
But the general opinion was for a diverse kingdom like in the middle ages
But Bismarck still made a lot of social reforms, right
He may hate the idea of a socialist country but he wasn't realised that reforms were needed
He wasn't the brightest either
Rip 3rd Army
But still he made a miracle by defeating the red army, whitout him Easter Europe would have been overrun
More in a "respected" sense of meaning
How can enyone see that communist dictator as hero
To be honest the Ottomans might have just done something similar to Wallachia if the opportunity presented itself
I shall lock you in the seven towers, and make you sit on the flaming throne
lust I guess
This torture fantasy of yours got out of hand
Even in Hungary he was seen as just the worst, my family still takes about how our relatives in Romania was amazed how much food and stuff we had under the communist regime
There are some Hungarians too who are nostalgic to communism but for us communism was way softer
Hungary declaring war on the US in 1941
Not like the rest of WW2 decisions weren’t awful, but this one is actually funny
There is an anecdote about the situation (of course it didn’t happen, but very telling):
So the aid goes to Roosevelt and declares war
He asks if Hungary is a Kingdom or a republic
Aid responds it’s a kingdom
FDR: What’s the King’s name
Aide: Hungary doesn’t have a King
FDR: Then who runs the kingdom
Aide: A Regent by the name of Admiral Miklós Horthy
FDR: Admiral
Then Hungary must have a powerful navy
Aide: Hungary has no navy; it doesn’t even have access to the sea
FDR: Wars are often fought for religious reasons
What’s the main religion there
Aide: Catholicism, Mr
President
But Admiral Horthy is Protestant
FDR: Did this admiral declare war on us because of territorial claims then
Aide: Hungary’s territorial claims are against Romania
FDR: In that case, did Hungary declare war on Romania
Aide: No, Hungary and Romania are allies
FDR: Let me get this straight
Hungary is a  kingdom run by a Regent who’s an admiral without a navy, and it is  allied with Romania against which it has territorial claims but it has  declared war on the U.S. against which it doesn’t.
Aide: That’s right, Mr
President
Being too soft on the powerholders of the previous regime during the fall of communism
"yay we defeated a multi ethnic empire which was crumbling because of said ethnicities, let's make another one with same ethnicities
Unfortunately the reason isn’t that funny
It was on 12 December, a few days after Pearl Harbour
Hungary joined the Axis before, It was a formality to show loyalty towards Germany so Hungary won’t be invaded, but since Germany and Italy declared war too the ministry (behind Horthy’s back, and with some resistance from other members) decided we had to do it also
But Hungary also had armistice negotiations with the US, (and later with the Soviets) which actually resulted in occupation by Germany so let’s just say things were a ‘little’ chaotic back then
2 multy ethnic empires that didn't really care about minorities and only cared about themselves
How is comparing the two dumb
It’s a very complex subject, to be honest
It’s understandable that they went with the path of least resistance, but Hitler was the strong man at least part of the country actually believed in, and when deportations started, they took a very active role, let’s just say the antisemite propaganda found a ground where it’s fruit could grow into something very poisonous (and the aftermath can still be felt to this day)
Horthy did try to minimize the damage but the anti-jew laws were still accepted, and a lot of people in the government weren’t just submissing to fascism, but they were actively supporting it
I’m saying this because to this day there is the agenda that we were victims of the whole thing and dont want to take responsibility, which is harmful because if we dont face the dynamics that lead to past mistakes, we are going to keep repeating them
On the other hand, just purely based on geography/political power I agree that the only way not having the country burned to the ground was not going against the Axis
I'm sure Slovenians, Croatians, Bosnians, Montenegrins would like to have a talk with you then
Especially since Belgrade was abusing its power and actually committed genocide
If you are asking who did yugoslavia commit genocide on as a serb (judging from your user flair) then there are problems
But fair enough, didn't know much about the Montenegrin part, was just assuming they were full of it as well
Apologies then, wasn't taught about yugoslav wars as they were rather recent at the time and never really read up on it just vaguely
I was talking about Sebrenica massacre
Second link is broken for me (403), here's a working one:
I'd say Sopron
Its proximity to Austria makes it very attractive for people because they can get a job on the other side of the border (even in Vienna) while having a lower cost of living
Also lots of Austrian cash flowing in because they can get services cheaper here, dentists for example are making bank in Sopron
One of the few cities with a positive population growth
If not Sopron then Budapest
The capital's hard to beat, being nearly 9 times bigger than our 2nd largest city in a heavily centralized country and such
I would say the whole Győr-Moson-Sopron county is benefiting from the internal population migration and the proximity of highly developed regions (besides Vienna there is also the Bratislava-region)
Sopron, Győr and smaller towns like Mosonmagyaróvár also had grown in the past years
Sopron is insane, officially it is a town of 60000, but there are estimations that the real number can be around 100000
And as Budapest grows, its surrounding area does the same, tows like Érd, Szigetszentmiklós, Dunakeszi, Budaörs and Szentendre all had 7-15% population growth between 2011 and 2020, I don't know much about their infrastructure though
What is something that you feel like is almost everywhere, but not in your country
A properly functioning middle class & classes above
Damn, I'm so happy this blew up
Right there with you neighbour
We have this too - it is so sad :(
Just curious, do you guys also have Schitzel or is it only an Austro-Hungarian thing
It's not a competition (:
Which is Vladimir in incognito, isn't it
Bares für Rares is a good show
I actually don't know much about other German foods, I only visited once briefly
Schitzel is a very good, we eat it at least once a week here
Well, I can't actually say that you're not in a harder situation than a lot of others/us because, well, it's Macedonia, no offense
But still there are things that are missed in other countries because everyone lacks more or less things, so you know what I'm trying to say haha
Typo, I was tired and my spelling is "unique"
Either is fine, just like with the number seven
But I'm pretty sure 99% of the time I see both (z and 7) without the line
Huh, TIL that there's no z in Swedish
I don't know the statistics, but every 4th person I know has a second name, so I would say it's not common, but not rare
Their ecological footprint
And those meter high fences you can just hop over
>Which leads to the next unusual thing about America, the need of a business seems to rank higher than the need of a human
When Americans, especially those on the political right, talk about human rights, the priority seems to be *the right to make money however you want*. It seems more sacred than anything else, maybe with the exception of guns
I know the point is that the rate decreased significantly but "only about 50%" is still hilariously weird to me
Like, ONLY
More like HOLY SHIT HALF THE POPULATION
Peanut butter and jelly, deep fried
I can feel the heart attack
Especially as it still doesn't specify which Frankfurt
Although I assume it's Frankfurt am Main
Thing is, approaching this from a legal standpoint is useless
Children don't know their rights as such, they are not aware of court rulings - if they are pressured by teachers or their peers, which is bound to happen, they have zero real choice
>A lot of stores don’t even accept personal checks anymore
The fact that they used to accept them in the past is weird enough to me
A book I read referred to that as 'Eastern European way' - the point is not to burn others accidentally with the cigarette
>She drove her car across the street everyday
Literally across the street
As in, the office was on one side of the street, while her apartment was on the other side
Because then surely simply getting in the car, parking it, and then getting out would take longer than walking
And it's not just about the dirt, really - it's such a nice feeling, after a long day, to finally take your shoes off and let your feet breathe
It's one of life's great pleasures
Walking into a store and immediately being pounced on with a big "HI HOW ARE YOU HOW CAN I HELP YOU" is the very opposite of a pleasant experience
My ideal shopping experience would be being left well alone until I need something - be available at that point, that's all I ask
Yeah, that's still insane to me
The delightful thing is that you can combine the two
(And I don't mean that you should take a shit in your shoes)
Oh so they want me to actively hate the place
That makes a certain amount of twisted sense, I suppose
Thank fuck most store owners around here haven't heard of that research
Or are content to just have their employees say a simple, unintrusive "hi".
> It may cut down on shoplifting, but it also chases away legitimate customers like us
Which is exactly why I'm not convinced it's a good idea, even if it does cut down on shoplifting
It's just hard to measure "number of customers who got out because they were annoyed by the sales staff".
I like the _Palace of Arts_ very much
It was completed in 2005
It has a large and very good and modern concert hall, a smaller theatre stage, and it houses the museum of modern arts
As Miskolc only became a regional center after the first world war, and as it was considered as a "new city" after the second world war, it has plenty of modern/brutalist buildings
I just linked a few, choose what you like
[The city hall,] the [Macropolis office-apartment block] [this building in the county hospital] cave bath,] [Avas TV/Look-Out Tower]
The whole university campus, for example [the main building] [the newest reconstruction (W.I.P. picture, but I didn't find a completed one)] or [the sport arena]
[Szinvapark mall] [Peczel Mór street] [the Jesuit high school and church,] [the reformed church of Miskolctapolca]
There are much more than this, sadly lot of them are in bad shape because the economical regression after 1989 and the general ignorance and hatred against the buildings of this era, like the [Juno Hotel] or the "[Hűtőház] (cold store)
This looks like a giant cubist fish
Entirely rebuilding an old building that no longer exists (even according to the original plans) is a good example of kitsch, and obviously not of good taste
You can see the concert hall itself inside and above the main block on the first picture
It's pretty much an independent structure (it's flexibly connected to the other parts, so the vibration and noise from the railways and road traffic isn't transferred to it)
Why not both
They look like the standard Vienna subway stations, except the colour of the line is more attractive (than the red of U1 or green of U4 etc)
But I don't understand the platform gates: you can have fully automated, driverless subways without those ugly structures: the Budapest metro line M4 is of this kind (the trains don't even have a driver's cab, you can watch the track in the front), but not this nonsense: there are photocell sensors in case anybody falls onto the track, and the trains are stopped
This line is in operation for almost 7 years, and AFAIK there were like 2 accidents, actually less than the usual number of suicides on the other, manned lines
I've never been to Warsaw, so I haven't seen it with my eyes
And I understand why it was important to you guys emotionally to rebuild the old town
And I don't want to hurt your feelings
But for me, it isn't an old town, those are new buildings which resemble the old ones
The old town of Warsaw is totally gone, even if there is a lookalike there
For me
I prefer the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin: it was the one of the most beautiful (or at least most important) squares in the city
It was destroyed, it was a no-man's-land for decades because the Wall went through it
And after the Wende, they didn't decide to rebuild the old buildings, they began to build modern skyscrapers and other stuff
The Potsdamer Platz is important again, but not as a set for some history picture
EDIT: and one more thing
They demolished the Palast der Republik which was a very imposant building of the GDR and stood more or less there where this building was built
They said it contained asbestos, but I bet the new Bundesrepublik wanted to destroy the memory of the GDR anyway
It isn't a fond memory, but it's part of Germany's history, just like the Third Reich
This is why I resent this rebuilt palace
I regularly go to Berlin, although I don't live there, and Potsdamer Platz is one of my favorite places there
So, 1:1 :)
Btw, I usually sleep at the Anhalter Bahnhof in the vicinity - I also like that they left that stump of the building there as a monument (even when the station wasn't destroyed in the war, but afterwards)
I disagree that the Palast der Republik was hideous
Of course Warsaw would be bland without the rebuilt old town
Of course
That's the whole point
The old town was destroyed by a barbarian monstrosity, and now it is gone
Forever
A bland city is the monument of the terrible war
You can build a theatre set to imitate the historic look, or you can build something new which can also be pretty and interesting and harmonic
They didn't even try the latter one
This is why I started with this: "And I understand why it was important to you guys emotionally to rebuild the old town
And I don't want to hurt your feelings
Fair enough
Would you support a really high level of European integration move
If yes, how far would you go with the integration
This
I fully agree with this
The "de-nationalizeing" of the parliament should be the first step
To represent national interests there's the European council
With a deeper integration, and the regional welfare equalising, there would be an amazingly tremendous pressure on richer countries (like Sweden) because of poorer countries (like Hungary) so in short term Swedes would probably have worst welfare then they have now
I also support it as much as possible, but for me I feel like it's more selfish
I respect your opinion
I don't think political integration have to mean cultural integration too
I think Europe is amazing because of all her different cultures, not despite them
Do you think that Polish, Italian and Hungarian people are more easily manipulated by populist politicians and their vote would be "mined" in a European general election
Or do you think that the established national governments would destort the newly forming EU government
I guess she would be the youngest of 3 peasant sisters who runs away from home to become a [betyár]
She would definitely have a [puli] or a [vizsla] as an animal sidekick
She would preferably be illustrated with Disney's iconic art style mixed with either the [folk tales] or the [King Matthias] styles
She would be very smart and witty
The story would contain typical Hungarian folk tale tropes, like she would outsmart the dragon with seven heads, whom no knight could defeat in battle
With this she would get half the kingdom as a reward, so she would become a real "princess" by the end
In Hungarian, her name is Harisnyás Pippilotta Citadella Intarzia Majolika Ingaóra :)
Can the Austro-Hungarian empire claim her
yeah, she lived in Hungary iirc
There's always room for more simps
it's a famous palace here
We do, if I remember correctly it had about half a page in the books so not much but we learn about it certainly
It takes up a bit less then 2 months of classes, 1 week (2-5 classes depending on school) on western front, 2 week eastern front, 3 weeks about Hungarian involvement and 1 week about the atrocities of the war (Holocaust, Rape of Nanjing, Katjin and so on)
The Hungarian education system generally has a "universal history" and a "Hungarian history" part where each era is first thought in general world history (which means European and a bit of Japan and US) and then Hungarian
They do it so kids may have a better understand of global political changes that affected Hungary
And how is it in Russia
I remember someone told be that you call the the Great Patriotic War (maybe not exactly that I have heard this a few years back)
Very interesting thanks
We try to be objective too but nowadays some books try to shift the blame for the Holocaust from the Hungarians to the occupying Germans (which is obviously isn't true)
Speaking about that generation is even more touchy here since there are still people who celebrate the defenders of Budapest as heroes (while their were lead by SS officers) and others who celebrate the Liberating troops (who also committed a lot of atrocities)
So we don't talk much about the Second World War in politics beside the Holocaust since whatever you say someone will be upset
That Immortal Regiment thing is very interesting, I have never heard of it
I see, I have only heard this translation from some girls from inner Russia
Thanks for clearing this up
I see
Just out of curiosity, how is it called in Ukrainian
And how is the Second World War generally taught in schools
Interesting, then similar to ours then the difference is that the Hungarian narrative also shifted to the opposite side lately
Hungarian narrative used to be very anti-russian, but nowdays it seems to shift
Many textbooks are trying to kind of make a revision on history because of political preasure
Everyone who reads r/europe knows that it is the [house of parliament] in Hungary

As I'm reading stuff here, only one thing came to my mind:
What the f.ck, what's wrong with the world
A teen delivered a strong six minute speech criticising the government at a protest in the town of Kecskemét. For some reason this appeared in newspapers from all over the political spectrum, some praising her, some criticising her
The thing escalated for months with newspapers digging very deep into her personal life too, one lied about her grades in school, saying she was failing many subjects because of protesting
She ended up speaking at other political events, was discussed in talkshows and appeared on TV
I have no idea why, since angry speeches at protests occur all the time and I don't know what was so special about her
Put paprika on
Well pretty much everything I eat outside of sweets
Got drunk on Pálinka and invited myself to the neighbour's outdoor cooking to get some paprikás.
I always have a pork liver pate like [this] and some unseasoned crackers in my checked in bag wherever I travel, you just never know when shit hits the fan in some weird ass country
In fact I have one right now in my suitcase
My friend who does a lot of solo travel for business in rural Asia rather trusts the Pick salami but that is a poor choice IMHO, above 30C grease starts dripping from it
If it was a side dish it does not count
We start to eat schnitzel between two slices of bread as soon as the bus or the train starts to move
No I think that's a more general price sensitive central european tourist thing
We have dual citizenship
It is most frequently awarded to Hungarians in neighbouring countries, who were separated from Hungary by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920
It has caused some conflict with Slovakia, who banned dual citizenship right after we allowed it, and Ukraine, who wants to ban dual citizens from holding elected office right now
I think that dual citizenship is a good thing, as it is in dual citizens' interest that the government of the country of origin supports them in their new country, and vice versa
AFAIK, you can apply for citizenship after getting married to a Hungarian, but I think a history/language test still applies in those cases
Its also the no
1 way for election fraud
Yes, you probably would
There are two ways for a simplified process:
A. Do you speak Hungarian
Anyone who speaks Hungarian and is descended from a Hungarian citizen may apply through a simplified process, regardless of residence
B. Did your grandfather lose his citizenship due to emigration between 1945 and 1990
Did he regain his citizenship
If not (and he is still alive), he can send a request to the president of the republic (János Áder) to restore his citizenship
However, in the latter case, I'm not sure what happens if your grandfather is already deceased, and what happens to the adult child of someone who gains Hungarian citizenship (i.e. if your grandpa/mother gained Hungarian citizenship, what would that mean for you
Otherwise, I think you probably have to go through the eight-year residency process, but it's probably faster to learn Hungarian and just apply that way
My source is Wikipedia, so I don't know more than the internet on the matter
If you speak Hungarian, you can get the Hungarian citizenship without living in Hungary
>What about elections on EU level
In EU elections, if you have any EU citizenship, you are supposed to vote in the country you live in
If you live in multiple countries, you are only allowed to vote in one of them (though I don't know how they would be able to control that)
I wasn't alive at the time and the Hungarian Wikipedia page only speaks about the current data
But the TV show, Deutschland 83 shows a little bit of the epidemic in Germany, it's a side plot, so not the focus of the show, but it was interesting to see a non-American series talk about AIDS, it feels like the conversation around this topic is really heavily centered around the US and Africa (for obvious reasons), so it was refreshing to see it in a different setting, by the way it's a pretty good show, so it worth checking out
I love listening to German and Dutch, they just sound so good
German
I could listen to someone speaking german for hours probably
Dunno why but i really love it
The accent is amazing as well
Irish is really fascinating, a super unique language imo
Norwegian is cool, very pleasant on the ears
I couldn't care less in most cases
Unless people talk shit about Poland
That's a no-no for me talking about my brethren like that
I don't care about insulting any country
Thank you
I feel the same towards Poland
Its people have some of the greatest and sturdiest resolve and the country and people are beautiful
My parents didn't call me by any nicknames
But my grandma always called me csillagvirág (Starflower) or kiscsillagom (my little star) though :)
Oh and mucikám (my ducky according to the internet apparently
I don't know how common this is (or if at all), but I was and still sometimes am called:
*kutya* (=dog) or *ló* (=horse) by my father
*maci* (=teddy bear) by my mother
My sister is called *boci* (=cow calf) by our grandmother
*tücsök* - cricket (the insect)
*tündér* - fairy
*bogár* / *bogaram* - bug, my bug (the collective term for some insects)
Are my parents weird
lol
On basic levels it's fine, but later on it teaches some sentences which make no sense
And of course in hungarian you can mix up the sentences a lot, and duolingo doesn't have that
Mentally abusing your own children
I cannot even count how many times I've been called a fat pig (for being not as thin as my siblings) or a retard (for getting a B /4 in my country/)
Being yelled at is the norm here in my parent's house
And if I tell anyone, they don't really belive me

I'll never speak to them again ever from the moment I have a degree and a job
The university's psychologist can help me in the time left

Thank you
It's ok, I'm used to it now
My parents used to tell me if I was misbehaving the Kunka would come and get me
The seven-headed dragon and the three-headed one as well turn up in Hungarian folk tales from time to time
Most of the time it is the youngest son of the poor farmer who has the adventures though, not a prince
Wait, that's not a thing in the US
I visited to Berlin last year
I went to a very authentic Italian restaurant (by myself), and there was an elderly, American couple at the next table
You could tell they were American, since both of them wore baseball caps, bright colours like purple and green and such; probably from Florida, idk
Once, I heard the waiter telling them in English (as he took their order): "No, sorry, there's no pizza with pineapple
" So, there's that
Really, mate
Pizza comes from Italy, it's thin crust, and ideally has only tomatoes, mozarella, basil, and a little garlic oil on top
Most every pizzeria in Europe has that, and then some vairiations regarding the toppings
Now please walk into the nearest Pizza Hut, and find something on the line of "Hot dog crusted triple string cheese pizza with baloney and spam", and rethink that for a second
Oooh, you mean like those kinds of kitchen appliances
I assumed like small ones like mixers, toasters, blenders, etc
Whether the big ones remain or go depends on the seller and buyer
A lot of times people move them to their new homes as well
That card game is popular here too and Black Pete is always a chimneysweep
Edit: [here] [are] [some] [popular] [depictions]
Nouns are not gendered in Hungarian
The two definite articles, “a” and “az” are used based on whether the next letter is a consonant or a vowel
The indefinite article “egy” goes with both letters
Sounds very archaic and strange if you use “az” incorrectly (ie
before a consonant), and using “a” incorrectly simply sounds wrong
The only time someone would not know which of the two definite articles to use is if a foreign word in Hungarian text started with a letter that has a different pronunciation than it has in Hungarian
For example, the “u” sounds: Hungarian pronounces the short u sound similar to “oo” like in boots, so someone who doesn’t know that Utah is pronounced Yootah could pronounce it as Ootah
Ahaha, *La nutella* almost makes it sound like it's some prestigious gourmet dish
I only saw TV in the last few years when I walked past my parent watching it so there are probably others
We mostly have American,(British
),German(yes including Cobra 11)and Hungarian movies but Bud Spencer and Terence Hill (Italy) movies are quite popular also
But why
It has a huge meme potential, imo
Wtf
Hallmark and lifetime movies are the best for when you just want something predictable and wholesome
Wikipedia explains the slow and dumb to come from the long vowels which looks finnish speech slow
In Hungary we say that your feet are hairy
Zentrifugal/Sommersonne is a good music to convince people about the non-harshness of German
How about the wooden shoes
As a country being on the receiving end of not surrendering french armies at least twice, we also don't use this
But its a Biiig one here
This is basically the only one in Hungary
A beginning of a beautiful friendship
In cities (or maybe everywhere) it depends on the season, the buildings retain heat, or whatever - it feels warmer after the summer than before it
If it's above 10°c and sunny, I would consider it in the autumn, in the spring 15°c and above
For me, it's
* below 5°C: winter coat
* 5°C-15°C: jacket
* 15°C-22°C: pullover
* 22°C: short-sleeved T-shirt
Depends on the season
If it's autumn, 15C is tshirt weather
If it's spring, I'm still cold in 15C, so I'd say rather above 20 during spring
The governing right-wing party, the Fidesz and the radical right-wing opposition party, the Jobbik switched places on the political spectrum
Said Jobbik fell apart after the previous leader, Vona left
They are currently on low profile, and cooperate with the rest of the opposition
Few weeks ago, the governing Fidesz-KDNP parties suffered their very first significant political defeat since 2006; the opposition got into power in the Capital, Budapest
Ukraine also started cracking down on minority rights, which is supposed to strengthen Ukrainian unity, but I think it'd distasteful and will just make minorities hate the country
(Hungarians, Russians etc
can no longer study in their own language and so on)
Our problem is far from the existence of Ukraine
You deserve your freedom and sovereignty
It's just that xour country is full of minorities (Russians, Hungarians, Romani, Poles) and what your government is doing is basically breaking internetional treaties about the rights of minorities and taking away their right to education in their native language
Don't try to paint me some anti-Ukranian, because I am not one
If you are a member of the UN, you are obligated to protect the rights of minorities
Ukraine no longer does
I understand the case about Russianization, but hundreds of thousans get caught in the crossfire, and it fills be with deep regret and anger, that the lives, rights and needs of these small to quite big communities are only thought of as collateral
As if they, as citizens, didn't matter to the state
If Ukraine does not want to take care of the Poles or the Hungarians or anyone else, and grant them the rights she has to, than fine, but let them be independent then
Do not force the Ukrainian language upon them
These people and their ancestors have lived there for centuries, they shouldn't be punished for staying where their deep cultural roots are to be found, and where their fathers and mothers lived before, and are burried today
There is no way around human rights
Either they are granted or they are not
Currently the laws in state of Ukraine infringe upon these rights -- the ones, that have been essential in humanity's quest for peace since the second world war
Dugovics Titusz: During the siege of Nándorfehérvár the Turkish tried to assault the fortress, and some guy climbed up the tower to plant their flag, but Titusz hugged them and jumped off the tower with the turks
well at least we have made-up heroes lmao
just dont swap the first letters of his name
> if he even existed
he didn't, some guy made him up to get some land as proof of how "heroic" his family was
The petty noble Dugovics family who claimed to descend from him was of Croatian origin actually, but historians basically all agree that even if it really did happen it was at the Siege of Jajce in 1463, and the name and the specific person Titusz Dugovics was certainly made up by the family to look more heroic, so not like it matters
Still a hero
One of my ancestors was a hero from the era of fort warfare in the 16th century
His name was Thury György/Georg von Thury and he was the captain of Várpalota
He was a feared by the Turks as the "Lion of Transdanubia". He never lost a single duel in his life and several people came to the war-torn Hungary only to challenge him
My great great grandfather fought in the Battles of the Isonzo
My great grandfather fought on the Eastern front during WW2 and later against the Soviets during the 1956 uprising
His brothers also fought in the the Eastern Front and one was a tank commander
Another went MIA some time in 1944
My ancestors didn’t like Russians apparently
Lajos Kossuth, who was  Governor-President of Hungary during the 1848-49 Revolution was one of my ancestors and my great-greatgrandfather was Károly Dietz who the commissioner of police of Budapest after the Aster Revolution in 1918 and was imprisioned by the communists during the Hungarian Soviet Republic later he was the coach of the Hungarian football team during the 1938 football World cup where Hungary reached the final
In 1944 he was sent to the Mauthausen concentration camp but survived
After the war he was banished from Budapest by the communist regime and worked as a nightguard in Bodrogkeresztúr but he could return a couple of years later
He died a year after my mother was born in 1969
My mother told me that one of his sayings as a coach was, that a striker can not make it to the penalty area alive
We still have his diary but sadly, some parts were lost, for example his writings about the 1938 World cup
Not once
Wich makes us something of an outlier in Europe
Also under Rudolf
Oh my god I forgot about that part
Speaking at least two languages, even in Eastern Europe (where older generations had no chance to learn western languages) the young generation speaks at least two but often three languages
Diesel cars
The distances are so long, it would make sense
I'll make it legal
It is more of a curse I think, we are pretty much forced to learn a different language so we speak at least 2 languages
Also nations who have more then one nationality usually speak even more(for example most people I know from Romania speak some Hungarian)
We have both
They are pretty much the same, there are some products in Lidl and some in Aldi which are better
Maybe the service (waiting time at the cashier) is a little bit better at Aldi, but Lidl is nearer to my home
National embarrassment to Sweden
You still asked questions
Even if they aren't prompting answers, they're still questions
Lízing which is said like leasing
*Flash drive* is called *pendrive* for some reason
Thought the English version was called pendrive and we just started using the phonetic version of it but apparently we made up a new English word and went with that
A scooter is a ‘roller’
They duckin teaching us these in school
We have that too, but more like "szorri vagyok" which is "I am sorry" - the funny part is that there's no similar construction in Hungarian, we have an "active" verb for being sorry ("sajnálom"), something like "I regret", so "szorri vagyok" sounds very alien
Actually, it's not really common
Imidzs as a personal or company image
Teachers telling us ''we might do a test about this next lesson so study
'' and then we don't and an entire afternoon gone by studying for something that I will never use ever again
On the other hand if we don't study and we do write a test my mother taking my free time away when I'm turning 16 next month
And like
all of the subjects have this problem, and like
every day
-Hungary
Oh boy, where do I start
Since I'm a senior the biggest threat for me is that currently noone has any idea how the scoring works for the university application right now
There are certain rules that goes against each other
Just this year for example they introduced that you must take a higher sat to be qualified to apply
Previously one higher sat meant extra 50 points, but now it worth nothing, and they didn't reduce the required scores
So for example if you want to become a doctor which already requires two higher sats in order to reach the requirements you must take a 3rd one- one that you might've never learnt, and you must prepare for that in your senior year
The other fucked up thing is that you can get extra points for different types of language exams
Not different level, just different type
So if you have an intermediate origo and an intermediate ielts for example, even tho they worth the same (except it's extra 60k huf,~180€, 200$)
Oh, and an intermediate language exam is also a requirement, but most of the public schools are lack of English teachers right now, cause they are so poorly paid they either switch jobs, or goes abroad
And if all in all this wouldn't be so bad the universities won't hand out scholarships if you reach the required scores anymore
One term is going to cost 3M huf (~9k€, ~10k$)
Of course the average Hungarian can't afford that especially if the law school for example lasts for six years
Ohh and the books are government censored
Of course as you can see this system results in that the intellectuals who are not worshiping this system and won't get money directly from the government are most likely go abroad to do their studies
I'm lucky to attend one of the top schools and 60% of my classmates are planning to study abroad including me
So the intelrctuals who are against the current  leaders will leave the country, only those who have some kind of positive connections to them will be able to attend universities, and proper education in total, and the ones who can't... Well for them the only option remains is work that doesn't require much education like farming
Oh they also won't be able to get non government censored news from around the world cause they won't study other languages apart from Hungarian
This oddly reminds me of feudalism
And there are much more guys
Can you elaborate on this please
Isn’t getting a secondary education compulsory
Ah, we pretty much have the same system except there isn't too large of a difference between the two in terms of furthering your studies
The main difference between the Középiskola (Middle school) and Gimnázium (Gymnasium) is that the former provides you with a small degree of specialized education in their choice of discipline while the latter provides a more general education with less specialization
Choosing either is not going to prevent you from getting in to any of our universities
Having said that, middle schools tend to have a worse reputation in general, but that's more the fault of the school and how it's managed rather than it being inherently worse than the other
Ciorba, the Romanian sour soup
It definitely was a pleasant surprise for me
Escargot in France
It wasn't disgusting, it was quite good
Goulash is a Hungarian food, so if you tried it in Hungary, then you had the original version
The rest is copy only
Nevertheless, there are good copies, but they will never be real
You should definitely try it out sometime
Copy or not the Czechs have beer-goulash which is quite a good twist to our traditional red wine usage
Also most peeps in other countries mean pörkölt when they are talking about goulash don't forget
Not really, but it can't go without paprika, that's true
I don't think that 30-40g to a kg of beef is wayyy too much, but of course it depends on your personal taste
The [Árpád flag] is a bit controversial but the most disliked ones come from the communist era and from WW2
Here is the [flag] which was used in communist Hungary before the 1956 uprising
And here is the [flag] which was used by the nyilas/hungarista movement (Hungarian national socialists) during WW2 (the red and white stripes are the same as on the Árpád flag and that's where the controversy for the Árpád flag comes from)
Edit: grammar
There isn't much, maybe the [flag with the Rákosi Coat of arms] is kind of a no go, because of the brutality the Rákosi government used to reach and surpass a Stalin-like dictatorship
The Árpád flag is controversial because of the same reason why old Viking era Scandinavian symbols are controversial
It has been appropriated by the far right and people associate the flag with them now
I wish the Árpád flag didnt have controversial symbolism
I looks pretty cool
some tap heads were the perfect diameter, we put a .5l bottle on the end of such tap and turned it on, then waited for the boom
not really games but we sniffed bolero (soda powder) and huffed technocol rapid (instant glue) in school
"operation" It was when a poor kid got thrown onto a school desk, four held his hands and feet, and the "doctor" pulled up his shirt, and repeatedly slapped his belly with his palms hard
Today that would be a case of serious harassment
Oh, and "grand journey".
One school seat put up to the wall (to counter recoil), one kid -who has the strongest legs- sits on it
Another seat comes in front of him, a smaller kid sits on it
The trick is for the strong kid to kick the other seat along with the kid as far as possible by suddenly straightening his legs: the other kid slides a few meters, before he inevitably tips over, and falls on the face
The most important part is the choir however
The name of the game comes from a melancholy song, "Nagy utazás", by the fucking legend Presser Gábor
There needs to be a choir of kids who sing the song with feeling, while one is sent flying with a chair
Then they switch, and everyone gets his turn
God, we had near constant purple bruises
EDIT: obligatory link to the song
51 - you needed a goal and a football
Kids would only touch the ball once and you only played for one goal
One kid would start as a goalie (randomed)
If you scored a goal, you got points, if you hit a goalpost some other points (points often varied)
If you missed the goal or the goalie caught the ball, you would stand in as goalie
When the points hit or exceeded 51 the current goalie had to bend over and turn
The rest of the kids lined up (first kid with the least points, last with the most) like a penalty shootout and had to kick the ball hitting the guy's ass
If he missed he'd have to stand in as a goalie, bend over and turn
As time went on, more and more kids would be sticking their asses out so hitting someone would be easier
Amazing game
We would play the game kakas (rooster), when we would stand on one leg with our arms behind our back, and we would hop into each other, and the last man (literaly) standing was the winner
I don't really remember what we named it, but me and my former friends used to play this game where a bunch of people would sit on a bench, and one of us would just run towards the other and jump on them
I honestly don't know how, but none of us ever got injured from this game
Also, i never participated, i always just watched haha
for us its car logos/brand of cars
Don't forget the WD-40
As someone who had to endure that more than once, I can back that remark up
probably "megszentségteleníthetetlenségeskedéseitekért", I usually use it when my friends are configuring stuff on discord and ask me to say something
grammatically correct word but noone uses it unironically, plus it makes little sense
"OMG your hungarian
can you speak some hungarian
"uhmm
"cmon, pleassssseeeee"
"hát.. inkáb magyarúl beszélnék most veled, mint angolul mert te anyira nem szeretnéd megérteni, hogy mit mondok"
"ooo
what does it mean
"mi"
"what"
this is just a situation that came to mind that would sound hilarious, other than that i dont have a default phrase
translation:
"well
id rather speak hungarian with you right now instead of english because you really wouldnt want to understand what im saying that bad"
"what"
Tell them it means Hi
I prefer "for your deeds of undesecrateableness"
Well, just about every nation that we share a border with
Maybe except Austria and Croatia
Plus Slovenia, since people usually forget about them :)
Romania
We just want transylvania back, to get ethnic Hungarians to live in Hungary
They barely have any rights there
Honestly our relations with Serbia got a lot better lately and is no longer bad at all
On the other hand our relations with Ukraine got worse due to that Education Law but it's still not as bad
I don't think today's mainstream debate is about Greater Hungary, it's about the minorities
Those are real issues
That whole Greater Hungary thing is dumb, but especially in the case of Croatia
If I'm not mistaken Croatia was never a part of Hungary, we just shared a king
I've never actually heard of that guy until now, goes to show how they don't teach the negative parts of our history, I guess
A lot of Hungarians go to your beaches on holiday, so I think most people here quite like you :)
Well I think it was mostly just a few villages, so even those nationalist/irredentist types aren't too bothered about it
>If I'm not mistaken Croatia was never a part of Hungary, we just shared a king
That's a heavily debated topic, which mostly concerns the area of historical Croatia only
Syrmia and historical Slavonia were part of Hungary, that much is accepted by most
After Croatia and Slavonia were de facto united in the 16th century, the legal status of this new increasingly Croatian entity became more ambiguous though
In the end, the Hungaro-Croatian Compromise of 1868 confirmed the borders of Croatia to include Slavonia and most of the Military Frontier, but also confirmed Croatia to be part of Hungary, or to be more precise, to be part of the Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown
Give them autonomy, and in exchange they will promise to learn Romanian
seems like a deal to me and a way to make them warm up to you
Fair enough, though the common depictions you see of Greater Hungary on bumper stickers and such also include most of modern day Croatia, except Dalmatia and Istria
[Gazdálkodj okosan]
The name translates to something like Budget Smartly or Manage [your finances] Cleverly
It was inspired by a dumbed down version of Monopoly, you go around the board, collecting and losing money
The goal is to buy a house, insurance, furniture and home appliances
Despite the name, there's minimal smart budgeting involved
It's not widely played nowadays, but back in the socialist era this was one of the only board games that you could get so most households have one
Gazdálkodj okosan
Really old game, around 6 players max, you go around on rhe board and on each tile something happens to you/you can do something (examles: get a luck card -random lucky and unlucky things , go x tiles forward, you can buy something, you have to pay a fine because of something, you did something good, you can roll the eice one more time)
You start with a certain amount of money, you can get/lose money from tiles and lucky cards, and you always gez money if you complete a circle around the board
The goal is to get a house, and every furniture in it
The thing is, you need to get the money for it, you can only buy certain  furnitures on certain tiles, and buying a house also takes multiple circles around the board, because once you payed a bigger amount of money the first time you bought the house, you still need to pay like 20 or more times that amount in small bits after it, and you those after each circle you complete around the board
A game of it is REALLY REALLY LONG, in fact I have never completed a game of it
Usually you play it for 5 hours, leave everything there, go to sleep, and the next day you just say: nah, this is boring, and put the game away for the next 2 months
Sorry for the bad description, I don't know the exact English translation of some of the words
It's not widely played nowadays
I think it's depends on the family
Also it wasn't the (literally) only board game, but it was really common
We also have Capitaly, it was the Horthy-Hungary version of Monopoly
It was pretty good
Came here to see if anyone mentioned it, i'm glad
Nem tudom hogy nem fejezitek be

According to foreigners, Hungary is Budapest and a lake called Balaton
I know all of those cities and have been in all of them
I feel proud now
I always wonder why Kapfenberg isn't called Karpfenberg
It would make so much more sense
Zaragoza is the home of CAF railway vehicle factory, very well known
I don't think that Kosice is not known in the region
- Landskrona - (partially) Hungarian made trolleybuses were delivered there
- Marbacka (sorry, I don't have that "a" with °), Ämtervik, Sunne in Värmland - where Selma Lagerlöf spent her childhood
Okay, these aren't big cities, but known
Rovaniemi
Kemijärvi
Inari
I think Samara is also known from the Lada model, at least in the former Eastern Block
>And although people don't really speak English, I was able to utilize my Russian (rarely, because people seem to hate Russians), some German and Hungarian with the help of Google translate lol
Oh, sorry about that, Hungary has a very serious problem with foreign languages
Although, I don't think that not knowing the Russian language comes from Russophobia, just people don't really learn it nowadays as widely as before 1989
Kőszeg is very cozy and nice, Sopron on the border of Austria, Esztergom, Szeged, Pécs, Eger etc
they're all quite nice places to visit
If Calvinism is your interest, then Debrecen is definitely your destination
However, Hungary is not that religious, not even Debrecen, only 43
8% of the population said they are part of religious denomination in 2011

It's hard to note the name change
My grandparents always call your country this way and they are living next to the border
Sorry about that
Although 100 years later you kinda did an Uno reverse card and Władysław II Jagiellończyk repaied the gesture by giving our nobles privileges which didn't help against the Turks
(I know he wasn't King of Poland, but he was from the royal family)
Then Debrecen would be interesting for you (besides the historically notable [Reformed Coll] and the [big one] there is a [notable smaller church] Also, there are other interesting Reformed Churches in that region, for example [Nyírbátor] Reformed Church (also the hometown of the famous/notorious Erzsébet (Elizabeth) Báthory), [the gothic Protestant Church of Avas (from the XXIII
century)] and the [Transylvanian wooden-stlyed "Deszkatemplom"] (literally plank-church) in Miskolc

Osztrák-Magyar Monarchia (literally Austro-Hungarian Monarchy)
I'll rather explain what "k.u.k." means: it's short for "königlich und kaiserlich" (royal and imperial)
This is well known
But the cause for this is that the Austrian part of the empire had an emperor but the Hungarian part traditionally had a king (because of the Holy Crown of Saint Stephen)
The only Austrian emperor who didn't make himself crowned with the Hungarian crown was Joseph II, hence the nickname "king with the hat". And Franz Joseph wasn't crowned with the Hungarian crown until 1867, the Compromise
OMM- Osztrák-Magyar Monarchia
Osztrák-Magyar Monarchia
Osztrák-magyar monarchia
Osztrák-Magyar Monarchia (Austro-Hungarian Monarchy)
And the fancy full name:
A Birodalmi Gyűlésben képviselt Országok és Királyságok és a Magyar Szent Korona Országai
(Lands and Kingdoms represented in the Imperial Council and the Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown)
Can confirm, we both from Hungary
What does Itävalta really mean
Eastern realm
Triple yep, but it's one of the two basic solutions
Make it four
We are usually very arrogant and have strong opinions about things that we don't really know much about
Hungarian society as a whole definitely has a pessimistic, why-even-bother attitude
And that's why we are friends
Isn't this a common thing in our region
Cup of fucking tea all day sounds really nice
People here just drink coffee (or alcohol) and smoke cigarettes for those occasions, so you guys have it really good

So, yeah
No wonder why, brother
Yeah, it's true
It's almost accepted to be casually racist towards them, sadly
I'm curious about the opinions of our neighbors on this as I don't think our two countries are unique in this aspect
Is everybody a rally driver there, just too introvert to go against others
The situation is very similar here
I had a romani classmate in high school, he was a really cool guy
He always said how much he hated "gypsies" as because of their behavior people judge him too and he just wants to live a normal life
According to his vocabulary there were romani: the ethnicity, and gypsy: the way of life that you just described
Our constitution has been completely re-written ten years ago by a guy on an iPad, with the people having nothing to say in the matter
Since then it has been edited several times to support the governing party, and give them supreme power through channeling every important decision through the hands of the PM, or some lackey
And yeah, that's not a joke
Actually, it is an actual meme known as "gránitszilárdságú alaptörvény" (~ "fundamental law with granite strength")
A random guy wrote the current one in 2010 on an Ipad
Then the 2/3 majority of the Fidesz fraction modified it every time when they got a new friend (or more like, another f***** oligarch)
Yeah, we have the 2/3 rule like many other countries in this comment section and the ruling party won exactly 2/3 of the seats in the last two elections, so they have full authority over the country
To respond to OP's question:
* Before 1919, the Hungarian constitution was similar in form to the British constitution, not being organised into a single law
* The first constitution in Hungary was created in 1919 under Béla Kun's communist dictatorship, and was invalidated after his removal from office
* The second constitution was created under Rákosi's communist dictatorship in 1949
It was modified numerous times, most drastically in 1989 after the fall of communism, but not abolished
* The third constitution, mentioned in the above post, is officially called Basic Law and came into effect in 2012
It has been modified eight times, the last time was last December, removing the heavily criticised administrative courts from the constitution
The judges would have been appointed by the government, which would have violated the separation of power
I'm using the conditional because they only became part of the constitution the year before, and the time was not enough for the system to be used
Are you kidding me
Almost everything we do as foreign policy I disagree with
Just to name a few:
- Supporting Russia against NATO interest
- Licking the ass of China and selling them Hungarian citizenship
- Supporting Erdrogan and his regime
- Being a general pain in the ass for common EU policy and generally trying to undermine it
- Being on bad terms with almost every EU country
- Supporting authoritarian powers around the world
The support of Erdogan, the way we handled refugees, the campaign against the EU, our relationship with Romania, our stance on Hungarians beyond the border, the "friendship" with Putin
From the top of my head
Our foreign policy is immaculate I dare say
Not that I'm aware of
Don't get me wrong, we don't have a problem with folks who want to become citizens, but there has been a large debacle on the sold citizenships(not sure how well it translates but I'm talking about "Settling Bonds" the government started to issue a few years ago)
Literally anyone could buy it without as much as a background check, and once they have it, they are free to travel around the EU with their ID and nobody would stop them
A very dangerous practice if you ask me
Depends on the kind of school they want to get into
For example: you definitely need at least professional tutoring to get into a medical university

1 hungarian go to karaoke song:
There are two problems with train travel right now - its price and the pandemic
(Let's leave the latter one out of the question, as it is out of our hands
If it wasn't for the pandemic, the problem with international train travel in Europe is its price
Low-cost airlines can easily outcompete train travel
This means that train travel is only feasible between two close destinations that are not serviced by low-cost airlines
If price wasn't the problem, I would choose train travel for trips <12 hours by train
Any longer, I would travel by plane
A lot depends on cost and route for me
From Budapest, really anywhere with a direct connection or one transfer, especially Eastward (cheaper) would be fine
So, Lviv or Munich for example
Anywhere in the Nordics or similar distance would be a flight because train would likely require multiple connections, relatively expensive tickets, and hotel stays (I can't sleep on trains anymore)
Type of train and scenery matter, too
The trip from Budapest to Lviv is quite pleasant despite taking all day
If it were miserable, maybe I'd just fly
...yeah, the socialist kingdom of sweden
You really have to live in your own orwellian doublethink bubble to think that countries with a king for head of state are socialist in the original meaning of the word
The video is just typical vulgar US political pandering, everything that you dont like is either fascism, or socialism
Who was it unpopular with though
I can't imagine the workers being unhappy about being given stocks of the company they work at
This
I think it's safe to say that Bernie wants to go further than the Nordic countries, but knows that it is not viable in the short term
He probably advocates for implementing the Nordic model in America because it is a more achievable goal, and it would still drastically improve the lives of millions of Americans
I just want a proper ww1 grand strategy game
Can I just say your username is legendary
Isn't this just Medieval 2 though
Austria: sógorok - brother-in-laws
I won't write the Romanians's nickname, because it's offensive
I've heard "kecskebaszók" for the Turkish, which means "goatfuckers".
We sometimes call Romanians "furry feet".
We have one for you guys too
At least you don't hate us, like most of our neighbours
We call that "lyuksógor" which means "hole-sógor" or "hole-brother-in-law".
We're a small country
Most of the focus is on politics
From what I remember it's about 60% politics / the events leading up to it and why we sided with the nazis in the first place (first and second Vienna awards), 30% battles and major offenses, and 10% holocaust/deportations/massacres
Hungarian here
First we learned the history lesding up to it
The rise of NSDAP and Hitler, the rise of Stalin, the rise of Mussolini
The functioning and charachteristics of Germany, the USSR, and Italy
Ideologies
The great depression
Hungarian politics 1918-1939
Then we learnedabout the war itself, it's battles, turning points, characteristics, the most important conferences, atrocities, holocaust etc
Up until the end of the war
Then we learned about how it all went down in Hungary, what lead to us joining it, then being invaded by Germany and then the USSR, etc
Finally about what it caused: soviet occupation, bipolar world order, UN, etc
We learned about WW2 in great depth, thd 1939-1945 part of it lasted maybe for 2 weeks
Also, it's pretty detailed, we had to learn the events by day (e. g. October 23, 1942, Second battle in El Alamein Rommel vs Montgomery), it was an interesting nightmare in high school
If you picked that topic at your graduation exam, you were dead
The Union with Austria in 1867 resulted a rather spectacular era until the First World War although the system was far from being perfect
Nonetheless many Hungarian consider this period great and are proud of it and it is true that many great and memorable Hungarians were born and literature bloomed as well
I dont consider myself a nacionalist although I do tend do romanticise with specific eras and this period may be the one which I like the most (not forgetting how Hungary treated minorities and how bent prime ministers were)
We were also the SHIELD OF EUROPE AGAINST THE MUSLIMS
There were so many shields, I don't even know how the bastards got in the first place
Let's not try to use logic and context, it is unfair
Well, to be more correct, none of us were really the shield
It was more of a problem of the ottoman overstretching in areas
See
See
That's what I'm talking about
There are like 20 armor pieces in a plate armor, but everyone wants to be the shield
Nobody wants to be the nasal helmet against the muslim hordes, or the bishop mantle
I demand to be the   [Culet] against the muslim hordes
At least we could say, we saved your ass
I am not denying, it is just if you put it in context it was not a very long time till we got busted and in the meantime the turks were also engaged elsewhere too
We got beaten at Varna in 1444
Fall of  Constantinople was in 1453
Three years later they are sieging Belgrad (1456)
There was a slow conquest after that, but for example we got beaten at Mohacs in 1526 and they took Buda in 1541
After that they are almost at Vienna
We had some nice success mostly during winter campaigns and some castle we could defend, but altogether we were much weaker than their empire and our castles were not very good against cannons
Absolutely
We eat geese, duck mostly besides chicken when it comes to poultry, but also turkey
In Hungary fois gras is a big thing and it comes from geese, and that's the main purpose of geese
Duck in my opinion is way too fatty and when cooked the meat can get too dry, but I don't mind some duck in my plate
Quail eggs and also in soup is well known and we also eat pheasant and
PIGEON MEAT that is very nice too
>Duck in my opinion is way too fatty
And according to most old folks i know non-duck poultry is too dry
Kazincbarcika in northeastern hungary has to be up there
any post-industrial ghetto like Kazincbarcika, Ózd, Dunaújváros, etc
In my opinion the old mine cities are the worst
As when the mi és were close everything stopped improving and then went backwards
Just every time I go to the capital
I'm from Szabolcs - not the best reputation - and it shows in my accent
Sometimes, but they're just envy how well I can roll the R
Well, not really, but my accent is noticable
In South Hungary, this is pretty common
Mostly older people speak this
People from the capital, or from r/hungary tend to make jokes about it
So, I use a lot of ö insted of e. For example, my home town is Szeged, but I sometimes say Szöged
It is so interesting that people can _choose_ between their local dialect and hochdeutsch
Hungary being a small country doesn't really have that, even if there are some mild dialects, they are perfectly understandable, people couldn't even pretend not to understand it
I was on a business trip in Baden-Württemberg once, there were local people and also some guys from Austria (St
Pölten)
While the locals (being the hosts) tried to talk to us in hochdeutsch, so that we can easily understand them, the Austrians didn't give a fuck, and spoke Austrian
It was very well understandable, as you say, Eastern-Austrian isn't that "harsh", but it was amusing that they didn't even try
Where do I start
Compound words: dumb people write them apart or don't use a - when it's more than 7 syllables long
Unlike English, which has prepositions, Hungarian has prefixes
If the prefix is before the verb it's attached to, then it's written together (megcsináltam 'I did it'), when there is a word between them, then it's written apart (meg tudtam csinálni 'I could do it')
Dumb people write it down as "megtudtam csinálni" which literally means 'I got to know it, doing'. It's mumbo jumbo if not written correctly and so many people use it incorrectly
Hungarian is phonetically written but we have consonant shifts because it eases the pronunciation of other consonants
There is a set of rules for all this and it's very straightforward, but still a lot of people can't seem to get it
(they write k instead of k, sz instead of z and so on)
Examples:
It's készpénz and not kézpénz
('currency'; literally 'finished money', not 'hand money')
It's segítség not segíccség. It's utca, not ucca
And I could go on infinitely
We have 2 kinds of "J" letters
One written just like that, "j", and the other is written like "ly". There is no rule to why you must use "ly" in some words, they don't sound different, but they will teach you all the words with "ly" in school just so you can get angry when people swap them up
Byste = you (plural) would be
By jste = you (singular) would be

Edit: I read once that most of the time they send like 20 title proposal to Hollywood execs, and they are the ones who choose one
Of course they don't speak Hungarian and mostly go by what looks good on the posters
At least this is how it went like 10 years ago, maybe today it improved some
Home alone is „reszkessetek betörők" which means be afraid, intruders

It's a really cool song
And also the obligatory Dragostea din tei
Oh, and also that Czech song "Ostrava" or something like that
Oh boy, every 90s Hungarian hit song
Just to name a few:
[Tedd fel a kezed (put your hands up)]
[Balatoni láz (Balaton fever)]
[Álomhajó (dreamship)]
[Titkos üzenet (Secret message)]
[Szomorú szamuráj (Sad samurai)]
There's a Spotify playlist for 80 hours with these
Also Dragoste de inchiriat
You forgot [Dr Bombay's Calcutta] Masterpiece
EDIT: my bad, he's Swedish
I live in Romania and I have no idea how can I have 2 flags at my flair
Very common
I mean, right now I'm sitting in an office where every single window is like that
It's not rare or seen as advanced at all
I was expecting some hi-tech "even makes you a cup of coffee" kind of windows
and you spill normal windows on us
I don't think you would see any other type of windows these days in Europe, unless you are in the UK or Ireland, where they are more rare for some reason
That is the common type, except for very old houses
Haven't seen a different window in a school my entire life
We don't have them at home usually, but in offices and public building they are the norm
Completely common
Some houses have the kind that only opens one way, but for offices, schools, government buildings etc
it's almost always the kind used
My house has old-fashioned windows but there's one of these in the bathroom
You can install window screens in european windows too
He is a great youtuber and he's showing everything about a trucker's life on the road
He is Hungarian, but as far as I know he has english subtitles on most of his videos

Magyarósi Csaba, the hungarian Casey Neistat
Hollywood News Agency- mostly makes movie critics but in such an entertaining and informative way
Yeah hungarian youtube is really cringey and is aimed for a young audience
Csaba Magyarósi
Daily Vlog, but not for the young audience
Really interesting and quality content, and the guy is genius with the camera
I like Pamkutya, Barni and Videómánia
Lemmino is awesome
He deserves to be much higher on this list :)
Yeah, he’s one of the few Hungarian youtubers I still enjoy
And don’t forget his travel channel, he goes to awesome places and presents his journeys in exciting ways
And recently the same guy(s) made a travel vlog
I have very hard time coming up with anything else woth your time in hungarian on the platform
I personally like the "Get Germanized" guy, he does cool videos about Germany, the language and some random stuff
Ahh and also their collab gaming channel
Well its not "terrible", but its not that great either - its "just another gaming channel".
Wait, is salut a french word
Personally, I love cats
I like dogs, but don't plan to have my own
I was raised with cats and not dogs, so I just understand cats better than dogs
Without knowing the stats, I'd say we're more of a dog country
The continent
Probably cats
If we're including Turkey in Europe, definitely cats
These [stats] for Hungary say >!cats at 45% and dogs at 36%!<
Love them both, but I have currently a cat
Hungary don't have a prefernce but i guess there are more cat owners here
There are no hungarian cat breeds but I love'm all
From dogs I prefer hungarian breeds
My favourite is the Vizsla, but sadly our lifestyles isn't compatible :D
There's also Mansi and Khanty, our closes linguistic relatives

I think while it's true that Ericsson is very well known, a lot of people still think they mainly manufactured mobile phones
0 dependency living in the middle of Budapest
No, I'm not, I've been taking the bus all  the time
I am still planning on buying a car soon
I calculated that I would save around 24 hours a month from waiting to the bus (not even the difference between travelling with bus vs car) if I bought a car
I would probably only use it in occasions like today
I have classes from 9:50 at Uni, but I can only make it with the 8:12 bus that gets to the city at 8:35, meaning I get to Uni at 8:55
Sure, one hour isnt the end of the World, but its an important one hour that I'd like to save
If Istanbu is part of the balkans, then i propose, that Budapest is the most important city of the balkans
My neighbour’s kid once found a grenade while digging in the building’s garden, does that count
Seriously, though, you won’t find much pre-1900 stuff just digging around with a garden spade
Maybe a coin or something if you’re lucky
But there are some Roman ruins and lots of other old buildings that have been preserved/restored
So, in that way, history is all over
1880 isn’t anything surprising, but it is fairly old
Isn't Norse mythology has a source from a Icelander writer
Isn't is called Edda or something similar
We have the same problem with the pre-counqest and pre-christianity (and even early Árpád) period
Although the Byzantine sources are fortunately most likely accurate
Buses:
Intercity buses:
*  You pay with money (ugggh), all of the time cash, to the bus driver and he gives you a ticket, or you get a monthly "ticket" and you use it as many times are you want
Inner city buses:
* You can buy tickets at the kiosks, on the bus or at the bus station with money or bank card and you gotta use them
One ticket for one way
Train:
* You either buy a ticket at the train station (there are sellers or you can use the ticket printing machine), cash or card
* or you can use the application and its also cheaper
Thank god you have that its such a life saver
If it works
I really hope we gonna have a totally online system soon, though I dont use much public transportation because my city is very small
Budapest transport area has ticket machines that accept either cash or card
They’re trying to unroll a mobile system, but they’re mostly miserable at doing so
Single tickets are therefore mostly paper and have to be validated by printing the date&time with a machine on the bus/metro entrance
I don’t see them making e-cards available in the near future
Hungarian Railways however have now a working app with online payments and mobile tickets
Other bigger cities have various city-systems similar to the capital
But then most places you buy form the bus driver, or in their office, a newspaper shop or a tobacco shop
I’d prefer not to have paper tickets at all anymore, but I only can dream
I so want to have a system like this
Well, we still have paperbased tickets/passes in most of the country
We can pay with cash or card of course
In Budapest, there is an app, which lets you have your ticket on your phone, you get a QR code for it and you have to show the ticket inspectors that
For the latter option you can only pay with your online bank account
(Is that the correct term
The RIGÓ flew too close to the sun and burned up :(
My classmates dad makes props for movies and he always shouts "silicone boobs
We have 3 different here in Hungary
The basic one is "csíz", which is pronounced exactly like cheese
The other one is "itt repül a kismadár" which means: here flies the little bird
The third one (my personal favourite) is "szifilisz", which means syphilis
Its possible there are more, but i only know these
Anything that comes to mind
Csízz (pronounced like cheese) is popular though
I've heard that one
:-D
But usually we just say "Csíz!" (pronounced the same as cheese, but it could also mean siskin - a bird species)
I have never heard that one, however we dont have a universal word, that everybody use, so its possible that a lot of peolpe use vizibicikli too
Some of my classmates used that
Guess it changes by region to region
"wheres that
ik i shouldnt expect ppl to know where every single country is, especially the smaller ones, but it still makes me kinda sad :(
Are you hungry
Even the best jokes get stale after you've heard them hundreds of times
Don't say the "hungry" joke and for fuck's sake don't bring up what fucked up shit our government is doing atm
We all know it and we're tired of it
Hungarian here
Once in London after telling the guy where I was from "Hungary", the reaction was: " and are you" suggesting whether I was hungry to which I said " well done, did you manage to come up with this on your own, or you heard this joke from someone else - but anyhow it's a good one, hahaha
But other than that nothing really
I don't really care about my nationality, other than the language it doesn't mean much to me
I travelled a lot around Europe and stayed in hostels mostly
I met all sorts of people from all around the world and I would say about 90% knew where Hungary was and about 50% have already visited Hungary
I was always amazed when they even knew the history of our country, it is always great to listen to a stranger talk about your country's history
But do you
>Even the best jokes get stale after you've heard them hundreds of times
Let alone this one, which has never been funny in the first place
Wait
So you want to tell me that France is more than just Paris, and Paris is more than just the area surrounding the Eiffel tower
Those damn American movies lied to me
I've once heard that Bulgarians are particularly annoyed by the phrase "Russian alphabet" when people refer to the Cyrillic alphabet
Is that true
Also, happy liberation day
Do people ever bring up Communism and the USSR
Nothing about Nazis
All the other Germans said that
Do you believe in Zeus
To be fair, about [2000 people do]
My favourite one is when they say
“ohh are you from Hungary
I visited Prague last summer”
Cool bro
Yes but that's not the point
"Where are you from
"Switzerland"
"I mean where are you really from
"Oh, I'm originally American"
"I mean
Where are your parents from
"<Same american country>"
"And your grandparents
I mean
Polar bear
>That being said, I think Germany did a good job in reflecting on their darkest days and being open and honest about it
Bro, I think Germany is no
1 in the entire world when it comes to dealing with its dark past
Very few countries are **this** open about **everything**. I have a great deal of respect for Germany and the Germans for this fact alone
In paper bags
>I think it's Luxembourgian because that's what the spell checker isn't complaining about
I think the language is Luxembourgish and the people are Luxembourgers
Beat them up so bad that only an Ikea Engineer could put them back together
>Smoking in paper bags
We call this "szipu"  and I think its beautiful
We arent the first at things, we are usually third or second at everything, but it kimda matches our mindset
Here is an interesting fact though:
There were only two olympics where hungarian athletes didn't win a Gold Medal: the 1920 Antwerp olympics and the 1984 Los Angeles olympics
Hungarians weren't invited to Antwerp because of the country was on the losing side of the war
And Hungary boycotted the 1984 olympics as a revenge for the American Boycott of the 1980 Moscow olympics

What about Schupfnudeln
Wouldn't that be the same kind of crime like pineapple pizza or pasta with ketchup
Interesting, I didn't know about it, but it seems like the Semmelknödel/Kartoffelknödel (bread dumplings / potato dumplings) duality is present also in Italy
Waterpolo maybe
It's big in the Balkans and some neighbouring countries
Sitting near the EU contries and complaining how better would it be to sit with turkey and russia
We would probably be the sexy college girl, the first to drink ourselves under the table, with our pal Poland (but they might be able to hold their booze), so Austria would have to take us home
Due to that all the other countries would think we're annoying, beautiful, but annoying
Also you would be delighted to be fed
Oh, also being sassy with Romania, cause the rest of the countries asked us to share the fish, and Romania took the front, which was suddenly our favorite
And offering everyone pálinka all the time, and getting offended, when they refuse the 6th shot
Romania is a Balkan country
There was a fantastic series made like 10 years ago, that took Hungary's whole history, and followed it objectively from the early tribal times to current days
It took ALL the legends and stories people are taught in school, or common beliefs held, and examined them in a capable historian's eye
Most had to be debunked, or at least corrected
Every nation needs a series like [this
They leave out the raping, pillaging, stealing and the systematic destruction of their culture and people
Those are the most fun parts
Edit: Words
We rarely get talked about
Do share if you have some
A lot of people here believe that you are just stolen Hungarian land so that's one
In Hungary during the Rákosi regime (1947-1953), it is absolutely correct
Just change KGB to ÁVH
Although, it doesn't apply to the whole of the Eastern Bloc

We learn about the finn-soviet war, and on language class we speak about Finnland and the other uralic languages a little bit more
You don't expect, but I think, we should learn more about Croatia
We learn about the unification with Hungary, then Jelasics and the Hungarian-Croatian Ausgleich
Exept of these Croatia is barely mentioned
Even we rarely learn about Croatia and we were under the same crown for a better half of a millenia
We have a common history, of course we learn some things about it
Someone mentioned that until Josip Jelačić, Croatia isn't mentioned, but it's not true
Actually, Miklós Zrinyi (Nikola Zrinski) was of Croatian background, and also the first named Hungarian poet, Janus Pannonius (Csezmicei János - Ivan Čezmički) has both Hungarian and Croatian origins
And they both are very important figures of Hungarian history and culture
In Hungary we learn about both Miklós Zrinyi  (the one who fought in the siege and the one who wrote about it)
In literature class we lare taught even more about the author one's life
considering a whole election was won by making people believe that immigrants will destroy our country but our holy government can protect them, i'd say we're not very friendly

As a Hungarian, I don't wanna talk about it

nah, it's actually the first day of the final exams for high schoolers so yeah, definitely not a day off
Everyone I know showers once a day
Some do it in the morning (get freshened up for the day ahead), others in the evening (wash away the day's worries, go to bed clean)
If we get sweaty, we might shower more, but 1/day is the default
Shower only since I'm like 10 always in the evening or after workout
I can't stand going into bed without one no matter what
Bathing in the tub is a waste of time and likely bad for the skin
Once every day (or every other day, once in a while) is pretty normal
If by bathe you mean filling up the bathtub with water and sitting in it, I haven't done that in years, I prefer quick showers in the morning and the evening
Never
Not once has that ever crossed my mind
Ever
im studying law so who else could it be but Iustinianus
Aurelian Restitutor Orbis, because of what could have been if he wasn't assassinated
He managed to pull the Empire together during the Crisis of the 3rd Century, and it says a lot that neither the Senate nor the Army wanted appoint a successor after his death
Or maybe Antoninus Pius, because he was only supposed to be a "placeholder" until Marcus Aurelius was old enough to rule, but he ruled for 23 years
Those two decades might have been the most peaceful 23 years of the Empire
Or maybe Claudius, who was ostracised by his family, but he did a surprisingly good job as Emperor
Okay, last maybe
Diocletian
Not for the Tetrarchy or his milliard reforms, but for his cabbages
Do you have a city or region in your country you often joke about or look down on
Just interested
Miskolc and the surrounding area is jokingly referred to as the Alabama of Hungary, but as far as I know only in recent memes
The city Miskolc, we call it our Florida/Alabama
(Jokingly of course)
I live in the netherlands
I look down at all of belgium
I think we moved on from that
Now we harrass Miskolc for being poor and dirty
Borsod is just shitty af but nice in its own way
> it doesn't have any cities, and its capital town is in Hungary
Maybe because all the other parts too used to be in Hungary
Btw there are some nice towns like Kismarton (Eisenstadt) or Nagymarton (Mattersburg) or Ruszt (Rust)
Trollhättan is the birthplace of the NOHAB locomotives
We Hungarians will always love Trollhättan
Etyekwood in Hungary built by Andy Vajna, producer of Terminator
Hell yeah
Those locomotives were withdrawn from everyday service in 2000, but the special historic trains are still always filled with passengers whenever they organize one
Budapest (1 750 216) > Debrecen (201 112) > Szeged (160 258)
Budapest is a well-known metropolis, politically left-wing
Everything is here
Debrecen is a large village on the plain next to the Romanian border with a huge Calvinist Church in the middle, politically right-wing
Seems boring to me
Szeged is a lovely tiny city, that has a large city center that could fit a more populous city
The Tisza, a large river is crossing the middle of the city which gives a tiny Budapest feeling
It is one of the large cities that are governed by the socialist
Also, they serve great fish soup
Definitely worth a visit
>Cracow
Looks so strange to me as I have always used Kraków /Krakow/Krakkó. What is the difference between them
Budapest isnt politically left leaning, it is closer to the left per se, but its definietly not a politically unified city
Some districts are left and some are right strongholds
Szeged and Debrecen are pretty similar, but with their own uniqueness
Both have strong universities with rich and significant history, and are basically a huge culturally significant and hisotrically rich city-centers with a hundred thousand people big village attached to them
The main difference is that Szeged is catholic and Debrecen was the center of the reformation in Hungary
Szeged is socialist, Debrecen is traditionally a Fidesz stronghold
Culture wise Szeged has a lot of unique cultural things attached to it's name, while Debrecen's culture is very attached to it's history
It was the capital of Hungary several times and called the Calvinist Rome in Hungary
>Rome is the 3rd most visited city in Italy, while Milan and Naples are the 7th and 9th, respectively
How
I thought Rome has to be the first and Milan could be the second or Venice
Edit: Ok, I have checked it is Bolzano
Interesting, who would have known there are so many people staying in the mountains
If Zoo then Nyíregyháza
I know it's mainstream, but lives up to the name
My favourite is the zoo in Győr, alhtough Hungary is very strong in the zoo game
The zoo in Nyíregyháza, Győr, Budapest and Szeged are amazing
The latter having many endangered species
There is a hotel attached to the zoo, nd if you book rooms there you can visit the zoo any time while you are there
It's a very unique zoo experience, you dont have to rush to visit everything
You can just sit there with your ice creame and truly watch the wonderous creatures there
Is is mandatory in hungary, with 99% vaccinated, we even have a small booklet named “Oltásikönyv” where the dates of vaccinations are shown

We literally translate every ruler’s name and title, from Extinct Tribe leaders from the Americas to the far end of the East
We have several handbooks for transcribing Chinese, Korean, Anglo-sax, Argentinian, “Arabian”, “African”, etc

I just toured through Northern Spain this summer and it was indeed amazing
Not mentioning the obvious big cities: Puente la Reina, Hospital de Órbigo, Molinaseca, O'Cebreiro and Fisterra were outstanding to me
There are few more derisive adjectives than describing something as "balkáni" in Hungarian
The stereotype is corruption, poverty, uncivilized conditions
Like saying that the railway company is run in Balkan style or the approach of the mayor is really "Balkan-like" is an insult
Similar to talking about banana republics
If we're being pedantic, then Felvidék! The accent is required ;)

For Hungary, I'd nominate Tankcsapda - Mennyország tourist
Thy Catafalque - Embersólyom (avantgarde/folk/metal)
FISH
- Gyere ki a rétre
Hooligans - Túlélő
Kies - Nincs az a sor, amibe szívesen beállnék
hmm there are so many great alternative rock-ish bands in hungary, it's hard to choose
the 'national anthem' would be tankcsapda - mennyország tourist but my personal choice is either esti kornél - nem kár or elefánt - bordahajtogató
so yeah, choose one
Yeah, Szélvész is my favourite track from the album Naiv
New album coming in 25th June
Probably [Ferenc Szálasi] He was the leader of our national socialist government and he was a huge fanatic of his fascist ideology
Rudolf and Ferdinand II, I guess
Quite literally actually
Several contemporary psychiatrists considered him to be mentally ill and based on the parts of his journal I’ve seen he really seemed to be crazy even beyond your average fascist leader’s level
In 2013 a doctor mutiliated his ex-girlfriend by pouring alkali on her, because she'd broken up with him a few months prior
His uncle is a well-known politician so the investigation wasn't as quick as it could be and in the end the police said he's free to go
After this, the victim hired a private lawyer or somethng like that and the case was reinitiated
For a while this case was debated a lot, but I think the publicity got tired of it
As far as I know he was sentenced for 11 years but he sued the prison for the bad conditions and recieved about 1400 € as compensation, meanwhile his victim got nothing and her life is ruined
It was an interesting and quite brutal case for sure
My information might be incorrect, so if anyone knows more about it please correct me

There is so many I will just put this here:
There was a big germanisation attempt by the Habsburgs so we have a ton of loan words
I’m Western Hungarian and never heard even though my family is of German origin and we use a ton of German words
Might be a Transylvanian Hungarian phrase, maybe borrowed from Transylvanian Saxon
I may be wrong though, in other parts of Hungary they might use it, I just don’t know about it
I don't see them often
They aren't viewed in any other way
Not that common but people don't really care
I have long hair (well below shoulders) and never got anything for it
Younger men are more likely to grow their hair though
Dreadlocks are semi-common
It's not common, but walking on the streets you will definitely see some
> least one in every programming team
Every team has a satanist-sarcastic man with long hair, a short smart ass with glasses, an anxious but energetic member and a normie who does the half of the work when nobody watches
Except the dadjoke-grade "I thought you were a girl".
Might just be the people I'm around, but I've known quite a few guys with long hair
Mine has been long for a few years now, but I don't feel like i've been looked at wierd because of it
Frankly THOSE teachers are like football hooligans, they are justblooking for an excuse to attack students, long hair is not something special, its just a decent excuse to be a garbage human being
Two names:
_Imádkozó sáska_: Praying Locust
_Ájtatos manó_: Pious Pixy
Imádkozó sáska
Which means
well
praying mantis
sáska, sás meaning bush foliage or thicket, the kind of natural obstacle meant to be cut with a machete; -ka is a belittling/nicknaming affix
Hát dögöljek meg de én még a kurva életbe nem hallottam, hogy bárki is azt mondta volna, hogy ájtatos manó. :D
Ez ilyen helyi dolog, vagy a standard magyar nyelvben előforduló szó? :D
Religious mantis sounds so funny I love it :D
Sáska is locust
Mantis is imádkozó sáska
It's never used in everyday speech though, just something for the taxonomy books
Ne dögölj meg, tényleg mondjàk rá
Amúgy én se hallottam még ezt a verziót sosem
Olyan mintha valami külföldi próbálna létrehozni magyar szavakat xD
A wikipédiát bekötötték már falun
Az imádkozó sáska vagy ájtatos manó (Mantis religiosa) a rovarok (Insecta) osztályába sorolt fogólábúak (Mantodea) rendjéből, az imádkozó sáskák (Mantidae) családjából az egyetlen, Magyarországon is honos faj
EDIT: minuszolgathatjátok, pedig amilyen az adjonisten, olyan a fogadjisten (ez talán ismerős mondás), nem én indítottam úgy, mintha egy darab szarral beszélnék.
EDIT2: na jó, akkor innentől kezdve az itteni magyarokra ignore on, kérem, hogy legyen ez kölcsönös. Ha erre a színvonalra volnék kíváncsi, pestis rácokat meg egyéb szennyet olvasnék.
>A wikipédiát bekötötték már falun
Anyád?
>Az imádkozó sáska elnevezés kissé félrevezető, mivel nincs rokonságban a valódi sáskákkal; legközelebbi rokonai a csótányok és a termeszek
Érdekes
A koma csak közölte, hogy ő ezt a kifejezést sosem hallotta, illetve megkérdezte, hogy az ájtatos manó esetleg tájszólas része-e - mindezt kicsit trágár módon, ez tény, de számomra (meg mivel nem csak én mínuszoltam, így ha jól sejtem, más számára is) egyértelműen nem a másikat támadóan
Erre az a nyomorult meg egyből úgy válaszolt neki, mintha a seggéből rángatta volna elő, meg itt falusizik
Nem adjonisten-fogadjisten van itt, mint amit ez a balfasz ugat, hanem kurva nagy arrogancia, meg a másik lekezelése, ezért kapja a mínuszokat

In Hungary, it's really disrespetful too, to confuse Budapest with Bucharest
But i think the most disrespectful thing you can say to a Hungarian is that Trianon was fair
Are you guys really that upset if someone confuses Bucharest with Budapest or vice versa
We don't really get upset over that
But I guess the topic of the Trianon treaty is a pretty dangerous topic which most likely will lead to someone getting insulted, so it's just best not to bring it up
I like the stereotypical French person from Monty Python even more
You know, with striped t-shirt, black beret, a cloth around the neck and a moustache
Like this:
We should change the name of Budapest and Bucharest Just for like a week
We already have PMs with the same name, so why not
I'm always a little bit confused when I read these countries in English
In Hungarian it's no problem: Lettország - Litvánia
It had a very welcome side effect in form of our Ausgleich
South Canada
The Bucharest-Budapest allience of Orbans
Think of the memes
We had our own version of Nazism called Hungarism
It's basically the same but with Hungarians as the center of the universe, not Germans
They were tried and hanged
Also counting forts:
* Hungary: Buda (Citadel & Castle), Eger, Sümeg, Visegrád
* Romania: Deva, Hunedoara, Oradea, Alba Iulia, Sighisoara, Targu Mures
* Ukraine: Mukachevo
* Italy: Sirmione
* Norway: Bergen
* Germany: Königstein
Maybe also Prague and Krakow, but I was too young to remember
There are probably also others that I missed
If we also count palaces, there are probably a few others as well
Well I live in Northeastern Hungary, an hour North and I'm in Slovakia, an hour East and I'm in Transylvania
Both of which are filled with castles
I've seen too many to remember all,.but the best were Bran castle in Transylvania and Bojnice in Slovakia
Edit: Also I live next to a castle
Castle (aka
Fortified residence) wasridiclously common
Pre-1600s, it was as common as your local police department (filling a somewhat similar function)
Thus if the area in question was populated at that time, the chances are that there used to be one top of a hill or in a swamp somewhere near
Ofc
depending on the a material it was made out of it could have been destroyed by the elements, or it could have been demolished to reduce the chances of successfull rebellions, or because it was a "burgeois relic".
But in general there are to many to count
My hometown used to have one (stone castle, middle of large swampland - blown up after habsbhrgs beat the uprising in 1848), 5km away my gramma's village used to have one (claybrick + earth + wood, rotted away due to disuse)
There are ridickously common, or at least were common - depending on political clkmate and materials they were made out of
Doesn't Slovakia have more castles per capita than any other country
Buda "castle" is a palace since the 1800s, while citadel is/was a castle/fort (now its an unoccupied fortress - as castle implies fortress where somebody lives)
Its mostly to do with british nobility not getting fucked over in multiple world wars, and retaining their stuff
Here in Hungary castles that were not turned into palaces before communism are in various state of ruin (hence no one can live in them, they are not even remotely fit for that), and the ones turned into palaces function as hotels, since original owners were either killd or fled
There are a few like the citadell in budapest that were in a location where demolishing them couldnt be done by blowing it up, and using machines and manual labor was just too much hassle
(And even before that - in the 1850s - Habsuburgs had a "blow up the castle" campaign after the 1848 rebellion, as retaking a casgle in the middle of 20 square km of swamp - like the one in my hometown - wasnt an experience anyone wanted to repeat
A Hungarian panvocalic word would have to be 14 syllables long, containing aáeéiíoóöőuúüű. An expression containing all vowels: vízi hosszúbukó-alámerülő működés.
In hungarian there is  'fiaiéi' which means 'the properties of his sons'.
I see your aeiouyåäö and challenge you to aáeéiíoóöőuúüű.
Or árvíztűrő tükörfúrógép
but they are not panvocalic
That's only the accented ones
Shit you're right
My bad
No, not at all
It's more common on trams
Only after 8pm
The Csángós are technically colonists, right
It's quite difficult to understand them at first
They use a lot of Romanian loanwords and they didn't adopt most of the language reforms of the 18-19th centuries
I speak perfect American English having grown up there and once been on a plane sat next to a man (bloke) from Manchester, around 2002 or so
He kept talking, showing me a newspaper with some terrorist, but I didn't have a clue as to what he was saying but he hated them
After a few minutes he gave up as well as I.
It has to be the end of the first WW and the Treaty of Trianon and the territorial losses that came with these events
Probably the 1848 revolution and the Treaty of Trianon
These 2 things have had the most effects on how we see ourselves as a nation
The revolution and war of independence of 1848-49, the treaty of Trianon from 1920 and the revolution of 1956
With all these revolutions for freedom you'd think that most people aren't far-right and fascist
I don't understand how you can put emphasis on fights for freedom while believeing in the opposite
I guess freedom has a very different meaning for some
The treaty of Trianon by a landslide
⅔ of the country was taken from it
And we just can't let go of it, it happened over 100 yrs ago, and people still talk about it as if it was last week
I would say March 15 1848
While important of course, if we’re looking for the most defining, it has to be the partition of Hungary after Trianon
Pacalpörkölt, I have to suppress my gag reflex even though I'm just thinking about it
I can only eat it when I'm terribly drunk

Something called Töltött Káposzta
It's cabbage stuffed with meat and rice
The concept isn't bad, but it always smells like farts
Like, it smells like farts so much that I almost threw up on multiple occasions
Yea krumplicukor does sound like some commie shit they wanted as a cheap alternative to actual food
Hungarians tend to clap the actors back in the theatre after a performance at least three times, -or even more- no matter how they liked the play
Even if they think that the performance was utter rubbish, the back-clapping is a must
Here if you don't drink you're gay or a pussy
I'm both
Two years ago, for the first time since its premiere in Hungary, none of the channels aired it
Fortunately most newspapers and news sites wrote about the travesty waiting to happen, so people had time to emotionally prepare themselves
The order of the universe was restored last year, fortunately
Is that a tradition in Poland aswell
We Hungarians tought its only our weird thing
We also have the bag with bags
We moved to our current apartment 4 years ago, I think the bottom of the bag has bags even older than that
Not my country but don't see any Danes commenting
The [Moesgaard Museum] in Aarhus is the best museum I've ever been in
By that I don' mean it's objects are the most rare/fascinating/beautiful but that they are shown in a way to construct narratives and stories to engage the visitors on a personal level
It certainly did a better job at communicating the ideas of history and culture than any other museum I've been in
At least for me, this approach was totally revolutionary since museums I was familiar with before are basically storage rooms with labels
It's very prevalent
Not as much as McD's but tied with Burger King
Breaded, fried chicken has been extremely popular in Hungary for a very long time, so they didn't have a hard time becoming popular as well
I'm just sorry they don't offer classic (not hot&spicy) chicken strips anymore
there are only 3 KFCs in my town (Szeged, Hungary, with 200
000 people) but it's much better than McDonald's and Burgerking in my opinion
Unfortunately, I can't find the number of KFCs in Hungary
They are present, you can find them fairly commonly (not as common as a McDonalds though) but I think their prices are too high for average Hungarian wages :/
If I couldn't cook I would have died already or something
Not be able to cook is just beyond me
Like, how the fuck you can even survive here
Pre-made food is not cheap here, so financially the best choice is that you cook

Yep, they are the ones that come to mind
Well, no wonder
It used the be the case:D
budapest is by far the biggest city; it has so much more life than any other part of the country, it's like a different world
honestly a lot of hungary just feels like a 3rd world country but the capital is a solid 2nd
i guess even the people who live here are so much more different than the rest of the country; it shows pretty well in the last municipal elections as in everything was orange (conservative party who gains votes by hating on various groups - just the usual stuff) while budapest was at least colorful with more liberal parties winning
budapest existing is the only reason I don't want to leave the country, it's such a cool and beautiful place and im so fortunate to live here
That's a pretty terrible payout for a lottery
Are there 10 winners total
The whole country is on a track to get diplo annexed by either russia or china
Isn't Burgenland named after three castles that aren't even located there
Hungarian living in Denmark
Here, in DK all dogs are chipped and registered, heck, even dog insurance is mandatory here
Not a single stray dog, except mine who tends to leave our garden sometimes on her own volition
but that’s hardly stray :) Also, weirdly enough what I heard is that even shelters are empty over here (maybe a Dane could back me up on this)
As for Hungary, I remember growing up we had some, but now that I think of it I hardly see any in Budapest, not sure about the countryside
Dogs are chipped now, but there are still some owners who don’t update the address, or are irresponsible, and poor doggos get lost and end up in shelters
There are lots of dogs in shelters
People, don’t buy, adopt
Hungarian living in the countryside chiming in
I'd say stray dogs - and dogs who have owners but don't give a fig about their dogs' whereabouts - are still a pretty big problem over here, especially in villages, towns and the outskirts of cities
A fair amount of people here don't get their dogs chipped - and thus vaccinated since you can't get your dog vaccinated unless they have a chip already - which raises an even greater risk at a potential encounter
Shelters are usually at full or nearly full capacity, and the numbers don't seem decrease in the long run (it doesn't help that the workers at quite a few shelters are condescending towards potential adopters from time to time; still a lot of people want their dogs to be primarily outdoor dogs which is prohibited by the adoption rules; and that Hungarians in general value personal privacy, so the random and - on paper - frequent visits from shelter workers as checkups are really off-putting)
As for the "adopt, don't shop" mentality, I'd say it's okay to pay for a dog if you get them from a legitimate breeder (I hope that's the correct word in this context) with certificates and pedigree
It's the backyard breeders who should not be funded furthermore
They are amongst the main reasons for full shelters and seriously unhealthy dogs
So I'd say "adopt or shop responsibly".
That's interesting, because it's the opposite in Hungary in my experience
The usually require you to use a blue pen when signing or filling out official forms
And guess what, it is the same reason for requiring black in other countries - I mean photocopies, but from an earlier era

Why is it risdansk

I think Sami doesn't have a seperated language family, I think it is an Urgric language although once I read something about that genetically Saami people are not related to "Ugric people" yet their language is an Ugric language
Yes you are absolutely right but still Saami doesn't have a seperated language family as that Dutchman said
Croque monsieur
And ciabatta + green pesto + smoked ham + tomatoes + mozzarella  = panini (pressed & grilled)
Freshly baked Zsemle (Semmler, a kind of bread roll), butter, Párizsi (Parizer or extrawurst or something like that), Cheddar or a similar cheese, and a few slices of fresh, salted cucumber
Serve with a few cherry tomatoes and the spiciest pepper you can find
I have to give it to the Americans, they know their sandwiches
Reuben for me
Smoked ham,cheese,salad is my favorit, but it really depends on what's in the refrigerator
Sliced chicken with paprika on it + cheese cream + cheese + Pirosarany (wich is basically pepper cream ) + sausage
Schnitzel sandwich
the fact that no bad political news have happened recently
Österreich bitte
I'd choose Austria, because it's close enough to visit relatives home
Generally people in Hungary look at Austria as a country similar to them, but better in almost every aspect
The average Hungarian doesn’t harbor any resentment against Austria, but I’m not sure about vice versa
I know that people in Burgenland are a bit fed up with the influx of Hungarian workers, but that is understandable given the amount of Hungarians going working there
As for the rest of Austria I can’t say
On the topic of the empire, I literally never heard anyone complain
Having said that, our history classes teach a lot about the revolution of 1848, but ppl don’t seem to have strong feelings either way
They’re teaching it as that “glorious revolution against our oppressors”, but most people just don’t jump on that bandwagon
i think they're pretty fine, especially since as a student i get 50% off
getting to balaton from budapest (roughly a 1,5 hour journey) costs about 3€ if not less for me
(granted, it's barely in time but still
as long as i can afford it)
I only know about the Armed Forces HQ being located in Fehérvár. Everything else is in Budapest, I guess
Dante's The Inferno
I couldn't understand like half the sentences
I put it down pretty fast
(It was in a 200 year ols translation)
Also, basically anything
I love reading but fuck those books they make us read in high school
ETA Hoffmann was horrible, they should probably give drugs so people can follow the story
Brecht: Mother Courage was also a nightmare
Otherwise I found something enjoyable in all of the others
We had to read it in Hungarian because its such a masterpiece
I was bored even by the shortened version
I think it was pretty good, but i was really into history
I think anything Móricz Zsigmond is worse to read
His works are painfully boring and the stories are so bland
The Hungarian form is 'huncut' which means something like a naughty (obviously the non-sexual meaning) or a playfully misbehaving child
No, I don't, and my family generally thinks we don't have nearly enough income
I personally
I could use a new laptop, a new cellphone, a lot of new clothes, a driver's license (it's pretty expensive around here, around 6-700€ to make one) among other things, but we don't have enough money for either of these
I imagine it's much different in Western Europe and in Scandinavia, though, so definitely don't take my opinion as every European's feelings
>I mean the federal reserve listed the median income as 35k in the US, and the median income is 27k in the UK and about the same in France/Spain
Is  this before/after tax
Americans never say the income with taxes
Yeah, but we Europeans often do
A lot of times and it's pretty bad since I'm still a student
It happens multiple times a day
Isn't that already a thing though
Like you can easily make a post with e.g: "Germans(or any other nationality) what do you think about

" Sure it's not a weekly thing but you are allowed to ask questions directed at 1 specific nationality
It's a surprise to see a Liechtensteiner but a welcome one
M1 often nicknamed as Royal Channel or Royal Tv
It's an extremely biased channel towards Fidesz, and portrays opposition as traitors to the country
It is also a public funding draining hole
M1 is one of if not **the** most biased channel there is
It's pure government propaganda
My family's guilty pleasure is watching it while laughing our arses off listening to the tremendous amount of bullcrap
one could say it is the main propaganda channel of the Government
One could also say they probably launder a lot of money through it, via overpriced advertisements, which isn’t laundering because they made it legal :-) I’m not saying these things, but one could
Not really
It existed before governments existed
And there are religious people who are against the government
And one could also say
>!Népszopás!<
You are kurvára correct
In Hungarian there’s no way to say “hers” or “his”
Everything is just “theirs”
Therefore Hungarian is the perfect language for communism
In Hungarian, there is no order for words in a sentence, like in german
You dont need to follow a rule about this, because you will never get a "wrong" sentence
You can express anything because we have so many words for feelings etc
Bad thing about hungarian:
Its the natural difficulty of the language
There is no similar language to hungarian, therefore its harder the learn another language
Hungarian is the worst language, i don't even know why i say things the way i say them
There are too many rules and you have to conjugate almost everything
That food belongs to the collective
The lack of gender in the grammer is actually my favourite part of the language
Wait, what
I thought I was familiar with this language
What does "övé" and "övék" mean then
There is word order but it isn't as strict as in indo european languages
Welcome to the Soviet Union comrade
Ugor language gaaang
I can say it’s an absolutely beautiful language that we are beyond blessed to learn as Hungarians
But it’s pretty goddamn useless for everyone else lol
Ya you just add an é after the name (keviné)
Kinda like with English (kevin’s)
I think the comment is a little bit confusing I think
We indicate the number of holders of the property, I think OP wanted to say we just don't make a difference between females and males in the grammar
It means theirs just in the sense of referring to one person
Isn't the difference that y/ý is "hard" and it doesn't make the soft version of some consonants that are before it
While i/í is "soft", so it softens those consonants
Like ti, ni, di etc
Or at adjective declination: some adjectives have the ending -ý in male nominative singular, others -ní in neutral (EDIT: not just neutral, that's the whole point) nominative which is much easier to declinate
In german skirt is male and trousers are female
True equality <3
I think you're wrong
The English language also has a gender neutral pronoun, but they recently chose to use "they", because "it" traditionally refers to objects or animals
We have _only_ gender neutral pronouns, since we don't have grammatic genders at all
I fail to see why would this mean that we don't have an expression which would indicate the posession of a single entity
It is "övé" and it means his/hers/its at the same time in English
And it clearly is different from "övék" which is theirs
Your formulation was very misleading, I think
It would have been more appropriate if you had just written "We don't have grammatic genders". It was too specific and false this way
You obviously seem right man
My comment was mostly a joke though so I really wasn’t trying to offend anyone or misinform
I can safely say I only know Hungarian because of my family and living here and have never learned the actual rules of it lol
We have a similar tradition: j/ly
They are both pronounced exactly alike (same as the Czech "j"), but they used to be different, "ly" was like "lj" in South Slavic languages
Nowadays it's also crucial for little schoolers to memorize the words using "ly" because making a mistake in this topic makes you look like an illiterate buffoon
XD I never thought about it that way
oh boy

Only Ukraine wasn't really a part of it

Tbh on paper a bigger unit could make more sense, but considering the relationships and good old nationalism here and there it Sounds pretty disastrous
No idea
ahaha I expected exactly this, its so great
Haha, I went to school in the 90’s, at geography class we had to fix our books and draw the new borders into Yugoslavia
I thought it was super fun I got permission to vandalize my school book
On the other hand we lived near the border and seen and heard the war, it was so messed up as a kid
Well, it existed physically, and parts of it were made of metal, so you were not that wrong
In the other hand, I imagined state borders as red stripes on the ground, or at least as a river or a ditch
There is a joke that a Hungarian migrates to Belgium, and he's drafted
On the first day in the military, the drill sergeant says:
"The Flemish shall line up on the right hand side, and the Walloons shall line up on the left hand side
He asks awkwardly:
"And where shall the Belgians stand
I wonder how on earth they figured that out
Damn
Actually I was preteen so I didn’t care so much, but it was all over the news
We silently watched what happened, actually Hungary had a lot of political and economic problems at that time and most adults concentrated to that
I remember that people got stressed out when NATO started the bombing
Hungary was already a NATO member and we had some military airports
(I don’t remember if they were used by the NATO or not) What I actually remember is the  planes flying across the sky and we could hear the bombs at night when the wind blown from south
Some people were afraid that Hungary somehow gets into the conflict because of the Vojvodina area
This area has a lot of Hungarian ethnicity and we all know some Hungarians always wanted to take back the lands which were ours before WWI
Fortunately it was never an option (as I know)
That’s all I can recollect from the war and the Hungarian refugees
Some kids attended my school
It was so fucking sad to meet those kids
They were confused and had only sad stories about their home
edit: grammar mistakes
Yeah it's a quite frequently used practice in my family, but to be honest only because we don't have big enough tables around
We like to eat, but really
What do you mean by that
Is this rude in any country
I don't know about you but I haven't experienced this at all
Especially not in Budapest where you have all sorts of food stands and takeaway places, but not even in smaller towns
It's pretty common to pop into a bakery for a slice of pizza or something, and eat it on your way to somewhere else, or while waiting for public transport
Sure but I don't think anyone is arguing that eating while walking is better than eating while seated
What I'm saying is that it is hardly considered rude (at least in Budapest and nearby towns) since everybody does it
I think most people pay so little attention they wouldn't even notice you eating, let alone thinking about what sort of a life you have
It has to be a foreign author though
In Hungarian we hyphenate them after every third digit above 2000
So 24768 becomes huszonnégyezer-hétszázhatvannyolc
Still ridiculously long but a bit easier to read
Évszámként láthattad egybeírva, valami oknál fogva ott nem érvényes az általános szabály (mondjuk hülyén is nézne ki)
Ha nem évszámról volt szó, akkor csak rosszul írta az illető, de nagyobb hibát sose vétsen
(If you saw the numbers referring to the years 2019 and 2020 that's possible because dates are exempt from the general rule - don't ask me why, my best guess is they'd look stupid hyphenated
Otherwise it's incorrect without a hyphen but as long as that's the biggest mistake someone makes i envy them)
Hát szerintem igen, de miért tennéd ki magad ilyen kínoknak
Amúgy szerintem az történhetett, hogy ezerkilencszázvalamikor összeültek az okosok, és kitalálták, hogy kétezertől kötőjelezünk (de akkor se mindig)
Aztán jött az ezredforduló, és nem volt ember, aki azt írta volna, hogy kétezer-egy, ezért bekerült a kivétel a szabályok közé. Gyanítom, arra nem gondoltak, hogy lelkes nyelvtanulók rögtön kiszúrják a sok baromságot
Amúgy hivatalosan mindig számmal kell írni a keltezést, úgyhogy nagyon ne agyalj ezen :D
(Yes, i'd think so but why would you subject yourself to such pain
Imho what happened is some dudes sat down in nineteensomething and decided that everything after 2000 will be hyphenated [but not always]
Then the millenium came and no one would write 'twothousand-one' so they made the exeption
Probably didn't think enthusiastic language learners would jump on the chance to dissect stupid grammar rules
But since officially dates are supposed to be written in numbers i wouldn't kill my braincells over this)
There was a large military barrack/base in my hometown, ever since at least before ww2, because there's a very central train station here
Then the nazis used it as a collecting camp for transport during the Holocaust, then the soviets took it and used it as their base until about 1989
I think part of it is still used as a much smaller army base, the rest is left to rot
Ferenc Liszt
Gypsy Music maybe
The first few that come to my mind are Ivan and the Parazol and Paddy and the Rats, the two bands that constantly have concerts abroad with a lot of fans, people seem to love them everywhere
And there's probably some more, that are more famous, that I fail to remember to
So no one's gonna mention Die Woodys

Let me give an answer with a specific example
There is always a security guard right beside the entrance of media markt
If we make eye contact accidentally they will say hi or if they don't right away then I will because it's just awkward if none of us does
But there are occasions when they look at me but I don't look back or the other way around and then there are also when none of us acknowledges the other
I always say hi when I get on a bus but it's not common at all to say thank you when you get off because you would basically need to shout across the entire bus so the driver can hear you and they are probably busy greeting and selling tickets to the people who gets on at the stop you get off so it just makes no logical sense
I don't talk to shop assistants if I don't need help because they are busy most of the time and why would I anyway
Cashiers greet you and you greet them back but in supermarkets for example it's not uncommon to not do that either sometimes
Talking to complete strangers on the street for no reason sounds a very foreign concept to me
On buses - usually not, unless you are showing your ticket to the bus driver or buying it from him/her
Saying thank you to the bus driver - maybe if you bought your ticket from him/her
As a general rule - we don't greet unknown people we don't want to start an interaction with
(The only exception I can think of is greeting the shopkeeper in small stores
(The situation might be different in the countryside, though
It's pretty much the same in Hungary
Depends also on the size of the town/settlement, the smaller it is, the greater the chance for people being friendly - among themselves, not necessarily with aliens/outsiders
Small talk is practically non-existant in bigger towns/cities with population over I word say 1-200,000
Hungary has a rich history in animation, we had a [world class studio] but died in the 2000's.
The most famous TV series is the [Hungarian Folk Tales] it had many episodes (it was in production from 1977 to 2011) so basically it is an inter-generation experience
[Mézga család] was popular in the 70's, [Pom Pom] in the 80's.
For TV movies my fav is [Vuk] but [Macskafogó] [Vili a veréb] [Szaffi] [Ludas Matyi] and many other are part of the Hungarian collective culture
Here is a super detailed list about the Hungarian animation industry:  [
[Cat city (Macskafogó)]
Macskafogó. It's something every Hungarian has heard about
The best animated film Hungary has ever produced imo
The Czechs have given my family so much
Pat a Mat is my childhood
I remember hearing that the Flintstones were funnier in Hungarian than in English so they came to translate it back to English to see what the Hungarians were saying
Golden Life - Aranyelet - was a good series from a few years ago that played on HBO around the world
wow, that's super cool, I didn't know they translated episodes to other languages
Tfw Beard loicense but german

Check out QI if you haven't yet
When I first heard Croatians look at Jelacic as a national hero I was really suprised, because he is hated in Hungary and considered a traitor for his involvement in the 1848-1849 Hungarian Revolution
In hindsight it makes a lot of sense, but in Hungary we learn about him in such a negative way, so I never thought someone could look at him differently
I would say Avram Iancu
He is a national hero in Romania but for Hungary is a negative figure because he was working with the Habsburgs in the revolution of 1848
It's a shame that they(hungarian leaders) couldn't accept that there were a lot of minorities in the country, I think that the revolution could have been succesful if they would have went for a multi ethnic hungary
But in the end the minorities were promised more rights and stuff in exchange for their help, but in the end they did not get anything either as far as I know  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
> In hindsight it makes a lot of sense
Honestly it doesn't. If I was a Croat I would despise the guy as he did nothing but harm Croatia
Yeah, around Central Europe ethnic cleansing is often seen as something to be celebrated
How can you be surprised by that
:) He was a ruthless reactionary neoabsolutist
Metternich isnt that big of a national villain for us imo, Haynau and Bach are though
I don’t think most people know who Khuen-Héderváry is in Hungary
And Kossuth’s role as a national hero is becoming reevaluated, many consider him overrated and an ambivalent or even negative figure
Kossuth's later observations and forecasts regarding Croatia's fate are rather astute
Too bad he was just a bit unfit to wield power
He isn't unanimously regarded as _the_ national hero of his era
It is known as the Western Front (Turkish: Kurtuluş Savaşı, Batı Cephesi, Ottoman Turkish: Garb Cebhesi گرب جابهاسی‎)[23] of the Turkish War of Independence in Turkey and the Asia Minor Campaign (Greek: Μικρασιατική Εκστρατεία) or the Asia Minor Catastrophe (Greek: Μικρασιατική Καταστροφή) in Greece
We still kind of still thunderously despise him but it was his administration under which many of the laws and decrees were enacted that helped modernise the country
It's a bit like Kádár around these parts: it's hard to forget and forgive how his reign started, regardless of the positives of subsequent decades
Not under his administration, but despite imo
In an 1862 article, published in Milan under the title 'Clarifications to the Proposal of the Danube Confederation' (*Fölvilágosítások a Dunai Konföderáció Projektumához, in:L'Alleanza, 1st June 1862)* he did accept the right of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia to secede, but warned that should the South Slavic nations be liberated from under the Ottoman Empire and form a unified state, it would necessarily have Serbia as its centre and '*\[edit:Croatia\]* could not count on the assimilation of the remaining components of that State, but would in danger of its own national identity to be absorbed' ('*nemhogy ő számíthatna a többi komponens részek asszimilációjára, hanem ő volna annak kitéve, hogy nemzeti individualitása abszorbeáltatik*')
(He proposed that the three kingdoms should remain with the Kingdom of Hungary in the frame of the proposed Danube Confederation
&#x200B;
I'm pretty sure that *some* of the antipathy towards him stems from, ahem, later events that have occurred in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary
He was probably the last Hungarian politician who seriously considered a compromise with the Slavic and Romanian ethnicities rather than with the Habsburgs
Nope, absolutely under him and on his and the king's command
You must be thinking about the passive resistance movement, but they didn't do anything politically becauss the point of it all was not to do anything at all
The thing is, when Kossuth had the chance to actually make a difference, he stuck to his guns about a fully Hungarian (language wise) administration
Széchenyi even warned him that it was a bad idea but to no avail (to be fair, he was pretty much alone with that view)
What kind of passive resistance are you talking about in the Reform Era
Yes, he was a great kibitz and a less than stellar player
Business as usual
What
I wasn't.
Then what were you talking about
'Cause I was talking about Metternich
I'm not afraid of losing the Hungarian language, it survived multiple centuries of literal foreign occupation
However, I wish we used less English loanwords
We somehow kept our language for a millenium despite it never being the official language of Hungary until the 19th century and the fact that we are sandwiched between Slavs
I'm positive Hungarian is here to stay
Plus Hungarians are fucking terrible at learning English, so there is that as well
However, I am a tad bit worried about the regions where Hungarians are the minority and not many linguistic rights are in place
And I'm really devastated by the reality that in the future, not far from now Khanty and Mansi will disappear
(Those languages are the closest relatives of Hungarian)
As a Hungarian I’m not worried about it’s disappearance, but my grammar in Hungarian has deteriorated greatly as I don’t really write in Hungarian (at work I have to use English) - though I’m mostly talking about grammatical nuances, such as how to spell certain things etc
I think Dutch is especially hard hit by this, considering how incredibly similar it is to English
I mean when I first saw a Dutch script, I was shocked to see how much I could understand despite never having learnt Dutch
Exactly
Having a vast majority of languages is one of the things I cherish in this dystopian world
The mid/late 19th century
It would be awesome to live in Austro-Hungarian Empire
1867-1914
That was Hungary's finest hour
2077, to see the fuckin' chicken breast ads on the skyscrapers
Well, you can't really top Hungarian movie title translators, we have some  wondeful gems, like
In Bruges - Erőszakik which basically means 'Dumb violent men' so there's that
Simply fabulous
Altough I must say every fictional word that was translated to Hungarian from the Harry Potter movie works wonders, easier for the smaller viewers and gives an overall better feeling about the whole movie
Slytherin is Mardekár
Hogwarts is Roxfort
Mixed feelings I would say
3 full stores and one for online orders only
3 and all around the capital
3 in Hungary
You really shouldn't be surprised, it's a demographic you never really had contact with over your history
Using the N word in Hungary for example carries about as much weight as offending leprechauns
Most people know that it'd be inappropriate in person, but unless you live in the most busy, inner districts of Budapest you may live your whole life without seeing a black person anywhere other than movies, so of course people aren't too concerned about what words they use in private
Then there are some who genuinely don't even realize that it's offensive because they never got into trouble for it
>  "gypsy" (or rather, the German equivalent)
Everyime it comes up, my mother says "Oh, my grandmother used to chase them from our property, screaming as loud as she could
" ... Thanks, Mum
She then tries to justify it by saying that that part of her family is Hungarian
Oh here she'd fit in just right
In hungary, they try to sell this central-european narrative, to say that we are better than other eastern-european countries
TBH culturally we are pretty eastern-european
despite the governments countless efforts to make people believe we'll once belong to western europe and we'll catch up with austria
historically and as for now (and for some more time) there's no doubt that we belong the the centre, post-soviet area
definitely western
idk i guess it's not just about geography but culture, economy and how developed the country is
Why would uneducated guesses matter
Yet I don't think most people know anything about the Baltics or their current political status and their culture
yes, and it's getting less and less accurate and getting outdated, if it isn't already
people refer to us as Eastern Europe because of the cold war, but that was a while ago
This is just my opinion living here in Hungary, not a fact tho, but I assume I know more of our situation than someone from Norway
Same for any country, I have no idea how people live in Norway or the Baltics
Not to mention I don't like to be grouped with Ukraine or Belarus or even the Nordics or Baltics because I don't see the point
Yes, I'm gonna rewrite history by pointing out that a high percentage of words in the Hungarian language are literal translations from German, and we borrowed a lot cultural heritages from A-H. /s
I absolutely think it has everything to do with economical,  political and cultural situations in those countries
I'm not saying I get offended when someone calls us Eastern European, but the case is not as clear cut as you make it out to be
After all if 100 year passes, will the cold war still be relevant at all
He was elected democratically
He isn't really a dictator
If you believe that, it's pointless to talk to you
Do you know the situation in Belarus
I never said we were perfect however
Yes, for I am not a barn animal
Cholent is very popular with tourists in Budapest
It's a traditional Jewish food, Hungarian Jews had their own version of it
Most of the ingredients are cheap as Jews often couldn't afford expensive things but even the rich Jewish families ate/eat it
We also have butcher shops which sell combos like a sausage or blood sausage+slice of bread+ pickled something and you can eat it standing in the window
These places are very popular with working class people and the nicer ones in good locations with tourists
I regularly buy Currywurst at the Innotrans convention in Berlin for like 10 or 12 euro
Poor people's food
Not so much
This is my luxury
Even when I can buy every genuine ingredient at the Lidl store 5 minutes away from my house, and I regularly prepare it
Don't forget stuff like Lángos (aka
hungarian pizza with the fruits of the cow), and the various kinds of főzelék (best way to describe is probably vegetable soup, or a REALLY thick vegetable soup, that is used to be eaten with bread)
Those can be made from stuff that costs very little
Yeah, I definitely should've added lángos
I'm not sure about főzelék, it is a poor people food but it isn't really popular with tourists
"hungarian pizza with the fruits of the cow"
Kőhalmi ftw
McDonald's at Nyugati station, Budapest: [interior] and [exterior]
Also maybe a [Starbucks] on the Danube Promenade, in the Hotel Marriott
Edit: a bit later the local KFC in my hometown (Nyíregyháza) came to my mind
It opened in a building of a previous car dealership, that's why it has unique [exterior] and an interesting, scpacious [interior] with high ceiling and a little [dome]
Probably McDonald's at Nyugati railway station
They did a great job renovating the place to its original shine, other parts of the building (designed by Eiffel's company) are rather depressing
It seems to fit well in the station, nice
The building of the Nyugati McDonald's used to be a high class restaurant from a time period when travelling by train was considered gentleman-like

There's a chauvinistic pop song called _Nélküled_ ("Without You" - unfortunately nothing to do with Mariah Carey - more like with the Bulgarian counterpart with Ken Lee)
"Patriotic rock" is an existing genre in Hungary, and it's pretty rewarding for the musicians, because there is a stable big demand for it
Of course, it lacks of every artistic necessity
At best, they are kitchy songs about the beauty of Transylvania or the glorious past of Greater Hungary, at worst, their lyrics generate hatred towards neighbouring countries, Romani and Jewish people etc
But
This song became a signature song of the country
Among others, the fascist prime minister Viktor Orbán likes to promote this song, so it's very often played at various events
A new, gigantic football stadium was opened some weeks ago (as if we had a football scene with appreciable results), and this song was also played at the celebration
One journalist who made an account of the event wrote that he hadn't known this song at all, and didn't understand why people stood up like it was the national anthem, so he didn't.
It generated a HUGE controversy on the fascist half of our society
He was called a traitor of the nation, billboards were put out about his (presumed) Jewish heritage etc etc
People acted as if he had desecrated the real national anthem, and not just a kitchy pop song from the early 2000s.
I think this is very emblematic for our country
:(((
_And did those feeeet in ancient tiiimes
I immediately hear Eric Idle singing this in the Matress Sketch while standing in the tea chest
Completely, and its delicious
However we slso have horse on the menu, which is seen as a curiosity butits also really nice, among other things we made some very fancy sausage out of it however it was too popular, and disappeared quiet fast
Deer(stew) and duck(breast meat) are pretty common, you find them in many restaurants
I don't see rabbit that often in restaurants but it isn't extreme
We rarely eat them
....despite the fact that the name should be a dead giveaway about its purpose
From where
I didn't know about it, but if it's going to be an 'adult' version, I might check it out
Last year I saw Piccolo Teatro's version and I was shocked how much substance there was to the story
It was an unexpected highlight for sure
Without being bit once
I get bit at like six different places every evening, and I'm not even outdoors, and use this anti-mosquito plugin thingy after dark
Here Na=nátrium, K=kálium
There are a few differences, mainly C=szén, S=kén, and heavy metals
For a good while latin was the official language here, when hungarian was officialised some people tried making new names, but they never stuck
Some do, some don't:
Vas (Fe),
Szén (C),
Réz (Cu)
Alumínium (Al),
Hidrogén (H),
Berillium (Be)
Etc
Until the late 19th century, most elements had a pretty different name in Hungarian when compared to their "international" names
Before the 1840s, they had mostly had descriptive and unconventional names (e.g. Hydrogen was called water mother (vízanya), water object (víztárgy) or water alcohol (víz-szesz) among others)
In 1842 (I think), they set up a convention for these names, intentionally trying to be different from other languages to protest the Habsburgs and strengthen the Hungarian national identity
It was quite controversial, receiving praise for its uniqueness and hate for potentially isolating Hungarian scientists from Western European ones
This unique naming scheme died away in the 2nd half of the 19th century, then it had a short reneissance in the 1870s, and then they decided to set up today's naming scheme
Here are some elements, listed in the form of *English name:* *1842 overhaul name* \- *Modern name*
Oxigen: Éleny - Oxigén
Sodium: Szikeny - Nátrium
Hydrogen: Köneny - Hidrogén
Calcium: Mészeny - Kalcium
Titanium: Kemeny - Titán
Silver: Ezüstany - Ezüst
We also have:
* Ag: ezüst
* Au: arany (might be related to the latin name)
* Sn: ón
* Sb: antimon
* Pb: ólom
* Cu: réz
* Fe: vas
There are also some others that are spelled differently, but pronounced more or less the same as the Latin name (e.g. k instead of c, f instead of ph etc
My favourite is *higany* for mercury which accidentally seems to match with its symbol (Hg)
The Latin name is hydrargyrum (liquid silver)
The Hungarian name comes from "híg anyag" (liquid matter)
Interesting coincidence, for sure

Artisan hamburgers became very widespread in the last decade
Arab kebab shops and Greek gyros shops are very prominent and integral part of a night out
Authentic pizza is also very well liked
Chinese buffets are literally everywhere, Hungary has the largest Chinese diaspora in Eastern Europe
Indeed
But the only orthodox topping besides garlic water is sour cream and cheese
I'm glad you like it
Btw, lángos is singular, it means something like "flamey", because they used to bake it in an oven as a byproduct of bread (it was ready earlier than a larger loaf of bread); nowadays they fry it in oil
Wow
_Édes-nemes_ means "sweet-noble", _erős_ means "hot" ("strong" literally)
Where is your shop located
Wow
My knowledge about Maine is mostly based on the books of Stephen King, but it seems a really cool place, and I wish to go there once
Yeah, baked goods with poppy seeds are really good
That is correct, in Hungarian the letter "s" is always _sh_. What you prounce as _s_ is written as "sz" in Hungarian (so if you know Polish, inversely to their practice)
"Rózsa" means rose (no kidding), "félédes" means demi-sweet
Every other line from the Tragedy of Man
For example:
"The machine is in motion, the creator rests"
"Fight, trust and be full of hope
The beginning of the National Song:
"On your feet now Hungarian
The ones that come to mind
all the food is really spicy or greasy where i live
it's just
really unpleasant
Hungarian pessimism is just straight-up fucking infuriating, and our culture is simply soaked with it
That we feel so special about ourselves in every topic
Like everything we have: nature, culture, food, anything is only found in Hungary
There are so many myths about this, because most people don't speak languages, don't really care about other cultures
"There's no lake like Balaton anywhere else
There's no food like goulash anywhere else
Our language is the hardest to learn to any foreigner
The best wine is Tokaji in the world
We have the most Nobel prize winners per capita
We have the most curse words compared to any other language
Well yeah
Balaton is a great place, but every fresh water lake with a beach is good
Goulash is a meat stew, there are hundreds of dishes which are similar; it's not a huge invention
Hungarian isn't that tough for others - if it makes sense at all to make a ranking in difficulty, Chinese and Japanese are always harder
Tokaji is a decent wine, but it's also not an exclusive invention to use the noble rot to make wine
How many Nobel prize winners are who actually lived in Hungary at the time when they got it
All the others were forced away or had to go abroad to be able to research decently
We don't have so much more curse words than the others
We just don't speak foreign languages so deeply that we also know the slang very well
Et cetera
We are not that special
Spice is nice, grease is not
That's universal
It probably has something to do with lack of money, no proper education, no future, dead end jobs, and that the infamous uicide song is Hungarian
It was on a hill next to other hills and a big ass rive
Edit to further elaborate:
The main terroitories of Grand Prince Taksony were in the inner-most and best lands in Hungary, todays Komárom-Esztergom, Pest and Tolna counties
During his son Géza's reign begun the westernisation of Hungary and Esztergom became his and with that the church's seat of power
**The seat of the king moved between Esztergom and Székesfehérvár**, the first was a sacred site the latter was the seat of the yearly "országgyűlés" (the gathering of the nation) and was the traditional burying site of kings
Things changed after the first Mongol Invasion of Hungary, the king at the time made it mandatory for the nobles to build stone castles, becouse the country lacked them
He also moved his seat from Székesfehérvár to **Buda** in 1256
The traditional capital of Hungary was from now on in Buda, but the offical capital was often moved
The Anjous and Sigismund von Luxemburg had their capital in Visegrad, but Buda didn't lost prominance
It was still the second largest castle, was a free kingly city and (plot twist) the seat of the 'országgyűlés' was moved to a smaller city on the other side of the Danube called **Pest**. (Oh yeah, it's all coming together)
During the three Hungary's time the Habsburgs moved the capital and the országgyűlés to **Pozsony** (Bratislava) for two reasons: It was near to Wien so the communication between the Emperor and the országgyűlés could be fast and Buda was counqered by the turks in 1541
The capital of the shortly lived Eastern Hungarian Kingdom was in Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia), aftern the death of the last Szapolyai king the EHK transformed to the Principalty of Transylvania
The things started to get back to normal after the coalition of the cristians in 1683
The Habsburg led coalition recounqered most of Hungary and took in Buda too
Pozsony remained the capital until 1783 (according to en
wikipedia I didn't find anything about it) and the seat of the országgyűlés until 1848
It was a big deal for hungarian nationalism as the traditional seat was Pest and was one of the main demand of the March 15 revolution
Since 1783 the capital city is Buda and later Budapest
Only twice was the seat of power moved
Both times to Debrecen in 1848 and later in 1944
Esztergom, Székesfehérvár, and Visegrád were the first few capitals, all relatively close to Buda
Buda had fortresses since at least the 11th century, it's in a great position for a city: on a hill, beside a large river, at the edge of two different geographical regions
Sidenote, the [list of historical capitals] is pretty wild
Both Bratislava and Wien were capitals of Hungary before
when you wrote L. Napoleon I started to think about the 47 Napoleons I don't know shit about
wow I tought Zagreb always was the capital
:( We don't learn musch Croatian history in school
Great summary
I'll add that in the 1780's the "capital" moved from Pozsony to Buda for two reasons: The new royal palace (the one that exists to this day) was built by Queen Maria Theresa, and the administrative reform of the Habsburg Empire (so including the Kdm
of Hungary) by Her son, King Joseph II meant that the Hungarian government (Helytartótanács) moved to the old-new royal capital
The parliament (országgyűlés) remained in Pozsony because its job was to function as a representative of the Kingdom to its King (so it needed to be close to the court, which remained in Vienna), whereas the government's job was to act as a representative of the King to His Kingdom
Here the emphasis was on Hungary, so being in the traditional capital, and most importantly in the middle of the Carpathian Basin
Parliament moved to Pest when tradition and constitutionalism (now being by the people, for the people) meant more than distance to the King and the court
Also, railways making distance less important
What kind of Austro-Hungarians existed in the 13th and 15th century
There were intermarriages for sure, but I think do you talk about the kingdom of Hungary
St Petersburg was the capital of the Tsar and the home of the aristocratie, the bolsheviks couldn't have the capital of the old regime, becouse then it would be clear russians aren't liberated but under new managment
Moscow was the home of the past glory and was more central (well if you consider only european russia)
We learn about things what are important to Hungary, but other than that we know there was the croatian bán and thats all
"leszarom" - I shit on it (what you have to say)
but to be honest the phrase that translates to "I don't care", "Nem érdekel engem" is literally "It doesn't interest me/isn't interesting to me" with "engem" - "to me" regularly left out
"Leszarom", literally means "I shit it/ I shit on it"
In Hungary we use plenty of these
Ki nem szarja le
/Who isn't shit on it
Baszok rá./I fuck on it
A faszomat érdekli
/My dick is interested
(i can't explain it properly unfortunately
Szarok rá/Leszarom/I shit on it
Basszák meg a kurva anyjukat vele/Fuck their whore mother with it
Kit érdekel/Who cares
Nem érdekel/I don't care
Nagyon nem érdekel
/I really don't care
We can ask "Most hova szarjak
" which literally translates to "Where should I shit now
"Ki nem szarja le
Akinek nincs segge
"Who doesn't shit on it
Whoever doesn't have an arse
But
but what about ,, Ki nem szarja le"(who doesnt shit on it) and ,,Ki a faszt érdekel"(who is the dick who interested in it)
Also: "Nekem nyolc
" - "It's eight for me
It can mean "I don't care" or "It's good to me either way". Or something along these line
How about “Hova szarjak
”, means where should I take a shit, implies I dont care
"Ki a faszt érdekel" should be "Who the fuck cares"
It is considered rude to clink with beer in Hungary due to the fact that the Austrians clinked with beer to celebrate when they crushed the Hungarian war for freedom of 1848/49
After that Hungarians swore not to clink with beer for 150 years
When the 150 elapsed it just kinda stuck to us not to clink with beer
Back to the future between Christmas and new year's eve
We usually joke about London being the second largest Hungarian city since there are more Hungarians living there than our actual second largest city
*distant Hungarian screaming*
Well in some circles they clink and shout "Fuck you Haynau
" which seems just as appropriate
Yeah only to beer
However if you are not Hungarian we don't mind, you won't be considered rude
Most Hungarians don't give a fuck about it these days
At least in my experience
We just get the beer say cheers and start drinking it
At least that's what my friends and I do and what I see people doing
If you really hate someone you can pound your bottle on top of theirs lol
Same in Hungary
A few years ago the channel that tends to air it dropped it to provide better entertainment, and got like 10% of the country petitioning to get it back
Since then as the christmas season  starts to close in the place an ad for home alone where a sad voice reads up "There is no christmas without Kevin
" to clips from home alone
Well I'd probably let it slide as I think most Hungarians would
Fuck
I almost had them and now you ruined my plan
Absolutely loved it as a tourist, but probably couldn't live there
Never been there but definietly on my bucket list
My friends, a married couple moved to there, because the husband got a good job offer there
The wife was at home with their little son
They didn't even stay one year - it was such a dull place to live that they soon seeked another job in Belgium

The difference between W and V is mind boggling to me
For example, when you say, 'What', you basically have to say 'Uvat' but the U is like a tenth in length of the already pretty short U sound

Translation to conventional english:
Hungarian language can be defined with one phrase: we pronounce words as we write them
We have much more letters than English including  double letters and a triple one
A quick pronunciation guide:
Cs - chunk
Dz - (just say d and z in a rapid succession)
Dzs - jumper
Gy - (tricky, it should be written dj) during
J - I, but without the vowel
Ly - basically the same
Ny - ñ
S - sh
Sz - s
Ty - tune
Zs - (the french j)

There is that fancy handwriting-like font (that I can't be bothered to look up) which would be a perfect fit for southern English

I'm not sure the Middle East is a good comparison but, yes, most Western countries are massive hypocrites in this sense
All of them love to talk about freedom, the principle of self-determination, etc
but only when it helps them or at least doesn't hurt them
That's why they were fine with the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the USSR or Yugoslavia but used their military to fight independence movements in their own colonial empires and to oppress independence movements back home
So, I guess the answer is because everyone deserves freedom and self-determination*.
*as long as they live somewhere else and their freedom and self-determination doesn't raise questions in my country
I'm not sure what your point is
That it's "all in the past"?
Kosovo is a pretty recent example of this hypocrisy
It declared independence from Serbia in 2008
This decision wasn't supported by the Serbian minority but in this case most Western countries didn't care about the lack of universal support for the declaration of independence and still accepted it
So, yeah
I think Western states should either shut up about freedom, self-determination, rights etc
or accept it that these principles sometimes work against them
I'm absolutely for the freedom and self-determination of people and I think it should apply to everyone
Kosovans just as much as Catalans, Kurds or Basques
Franco oppressed Catalans and Basques and Western countries still weren’t lining up to support their independence
Western countries literally don’t care about war crimes or oppression as long as it’s not in their interest
Think about what happened to the high-ranking Serb, Croatian, etc
soldiers who were accused of war crimes: they landed in front of the ICTY
I guess that’s great, we don’t want war criminals running around, right
Now, have you ever seen any Western soldier appear in front of an international court because of a war crime
Nope
It’s not in their interest
....and
It wasn't meant to be an example of modern-day Western hypocrisy
Colonial wars and the dissolution of the USSR and Yugoslavia just show that Western states had the very same mentality for decades so their behavior in Catalonia's case isn't something new or unique and it won't change in the future
1) Read my other comments, I already stated that I support Kosovo’s independence
2) I don’t know how Croatia works but the Hungarian government doesn’t ask every single citizen what they think about the government’s decisions in international politics
So, yeah, even though I agree with it, their decision had nothing to do with me
Well we have this called thing called “kicsinyítő képző” and it makes every name into a nickname for example:
-Barnabás —> Barnabáska
-Szabolcs —> Szabolcska
But almost every name has a nickname version so and they sound better with the previous kicsinyítő képző:
-Barnabás —> Barnus, Barni, Barna —> Barnuska,
Barnika (you don’t use it with Barna for some reason)
-Szabolcs —> Szabi —> Szabika
We have "-i", which is basically the same as the English "ee" mentioned in the OP, but we also have "-ka"/"-ke", which most probably came from Slavic
Oh köszi
Im not from there but i guess if you are rich is great and if you are poor it sucks
Just like in every other country
I think Bald and bankrupt had a video in Abkhazia
Good riddance

Messenger and Instagram will be missed not-so-dearly, the rest can rot in hell, for all I care
Now is it just facebook or every other app that is being part of facebook like instagram or whatsapp
Facebook-side:
If Facebook leaves, they lose money
If stays earns a little less money until now
EU-side:
If Facebook leaves, nothing happens
If stays, EU earn a little more money until now
I don't really see why (apart from lobby, of course) should the EU back out
There are literally hundreds of other chat platforms
Oh having three chat programs on my phone
The horror
What a problem
Btw, I don't use whatsapp whatsoever
Well, I guess without Whatsapp Europe is crippled we have no choice but to bend over and let facebook fuck us
Love him or hate him, but at this point, a world leader who is reasonable and at least resembles a human being is far beyond the average
Not saying there is no room to improve, or I support him or anything, but it's refreshing hearing some common sense from someone in a powerful position
I love the fact he was not reading it from a paper at all and yet it is a well formulated and explained speech
I can believe those are his thoughts and believes
Nice, but people who don't understand this won't understand telling them anyways
They understand only actions and force
I like what Macron says here
Now start implementing it and those who do not respect it must be removed form our society
Nagyon igaz
I deeply agree with this
If we van one thing, we'll have to ban the next accordingly and so on until no expression is allowed
I support this point of view, and it takes balls to stand by this opinion after all the shit that keeps happening in France
You can tell he takes his job seriously and he has love for his country and the people and culture in it
I wish eastern Europe had politicians like him
Because it's not about supporting him or not in general, it's about what he says about a specific problem, and how he says it
Also, because I'm not familiar with his policies in-depth and unlike most people, I don't like to form opinions on important things, like political ideologies without actual research and understanding
I realize it's not representative but most people I know dislike the way it sounds
In fact, the people I know who actually like the way French sounds are people who learned it (including me)
I assume it also depends greatly on your native language, maybe Romance speakers will like it more, dunno
...maybe when somebody tries to calm everyone down after ideologically motivated members of a minority commit attrocities, we shouldn't attack said person for it
If for nothing else, then to not make ourselves look like utter morons

That guy who was assassinated by serbs, was the one who supported them the most in the Austro-hungarian empire

I also match your observations about Hungarians haha for me Italian sounds the most beautiful
E al diavolo con i cechi lol
>conclusion is wrong due to it being based on racism, or if you believe that they are arguing in bad faith to promote xenophobia
Both of these will invalidate the argument being made, and must be pointed out no matter what "side" you're on

no matter what

Unfortunately I'm not sure policemen here would have been any kinder, considering how they treat us most of the time, at least
As for Budapest, well it's a very polarized city
Some parts are absolutely beautiful, with views you cannot grow tired of, but sadly it only takes looking 1-2 streets away to find shitty, almost slummy parts of town
In general though, I'm not complaining, for a big city it's not a bad one at all

Let's just fill in the underpasses instead of cleaning them once in a blue moon, that will be so much better
Yay for standing at the red light for 3 minutes
Unpopular opinion: underpasses are cool
It's the illusion of crowd
If ten people are standing at a red light, than that ten people will look like a lot of people and for a fairly long time
Meanwhile fifty people crossed down into the underpass in that three minutes, but that is like one person every three seconds, that is not even a busy underpass
People choose standing at the light if they can't take the steps comfortably (their leg or feet hurts, or just plain lazy to take a few stairs), or they are on wheels for some reason (wheel chair, stroller, bike)
Having maintained underpasses do not take away the option for lights, both can be done at the same time
Underpasses save lives and are a more comfortable option than waiting for two or more lights in convoluted busy crossings

Shh, dont say something which makes sense
At this point, nobody has masks
China bought out the entire stock a month ago
It's like that everywhere in Europe
Money can't fix that
Other equipment and beds though, that you can buy
Yes, it's pretty good business right now
Face masks go for ten to thirty times the usual price, but we've been quoted for 300 times the usual price too
If anybody announces that there's going to be a state aid for face masks prices could go to 20 to 30 times the usual, or even higher

Yeah
Who the hell cares what your represenatitve does or doesnt do, if she gives two flying fucks about your intrests

Yeah but it's the [Pablo Escobar Waiting] one
Yet you took the time to write a comment
Oh my, these are getting better and better
Desperate times call for desperate measures
Back then when even though the Cold War was raging, seemed like people were explorers and dreamers

What about for those who have (still nothing) understood that post title
problem is Scotland doesn't wanna go, nor Northern Ireland
Now solve this mess
Brexit bad, EU good, give arrow
For fuck sake's have a brexit filter already,
While I've lived with both options (UK / HU), I think private property doors opening inwards is a better option
If you're opening the door and there's someone who you don't want to let in, you can easily push your body weight against the door, and close the door again
(or use your feet to block the door from opening further)
If the door opens outwards, it's a fair playing field to the would be intruder
(both sides have to pull on the handle)
Also, if someone wants to keep you in, they can push against the door and prevent you from opening the door
The only downside is easy of access around leaving
However, it's worth noting that most properties that have inwards opening doors, also have a corridor in the front with plenty of empty space to open the door
This can be done in one round, everyone just has to mark two options
One they prefer, a second one that they would prefer from the other two, or mark one they absolutely don't want

I've been there,really beautiful,although i dont remember the line THIS long,it wasn't small but not this large
France should put this picture everywhere along with the Mohamed pictures
These clowns really think we are offended by this
PS: ngl, he looks like a Star Trek character
He looks like that one orc who decided to work in a library instead of becoming a warrior
Please dont put Hungary in the OK results category
As a hungarian, it's insulting to no be at least among the worrying ones
Hungary is definitely not OK results
We're almost always average or below average
What happened to Hungary's borders
Hungary should be in orange
Greece should be OK or average
Maybe this is a difference in the usage of terms, but I would call making yourself ruling by decree indefinitely because of COVID-19, and with this one of your first passing laws is the delegitimization of trans people "worrying".
now that's beautiful
I think I literally saw the one you’re talking about today
It said like most of the shows on Netflix are shit or something like that
Extremely blessed opinions
Hungary is a bunch of great lads
As a hungarian person i urge you to reconsider
Not gonna lie, the Irish seem like a great bunch of lads
That's pretty cool imo
"Could this be our guy
"Nah, he is bold
We are looking for a Russian, only Tatars, Uzbeks or Turkmens can be bold
Apparently Heisenberg is a  Tatar
Half of them look like communist dictators
The reason is probably, why not
This is what third wayism look like
Capitalists, communists
Who did the hooky pokey and went like this
can anybody send me the link to the hungarian one
:^)
Nationalism is the stupidest ideology imo
Like, what are you proud of
The area you were born in
People that died before you were born
Even without bullshit like this it's stupid
>He was heavily promoted in the ruling party's TV (TVP, taxpayer funded, well it's not theirs - it's supposed to be neutral) in recent weeks, as a "defender of the Churches".
I know that feel :-(
I know most of you know this,but this is not fucking normal
Here in Hungary I pulled out my summer running gear for the weekend because it was t-shirt and shorts time
The whole 'winter' I don't think I've seen less than -5°C.
... but fortunately there is no climatechange
Gonna love the 30C at midnight in my no AC room summer again :(
No matter how many times you guys cry about the weather
It won't change
We're more likely to tackle this issue but at the end of this decade
Until then
it's childish to act like its the end of the world
Don't get gloomy and obsessed over things you can't control
Your lifestyle doesn't help this issue
Last year's February was pretty cold, now It's a lot  warmen and but still there were days when it was warmer in Antarctica than in Budapest
U mean for another 2 weeks
So extreme weather all around the globe, showing that every place is facing crazy climate change
Not reassuring by any means
Have you read the news lately
I think it's already here
Even the cartoon mentions that some of the conspiracy theories are turned out to be true, so yes, you are right, xkcd is right
If you check it he gives up when the guy starts on the moon landing
Oh gosh this is perfect
I hope there’s a similar picture of János Áder

TAIWAN NUMBER ONE
Yesterday hungarys ruling party passed the ‘slave law’ which enables companies to make their workers work extra 400 hours
The overtime ony has to be paid after three years
Protesters confronted the authorities in the whole city, the police used gas and pepper spray several times
One more reason to get the hell out of this country after I finish uni
The law wasn’t even passed in accordance with Parliamentary rules
So technically the law is void
Now the next question is whether or not the opposition and the Hungarian people are going to rebel
During the vote for this the entire opposition tried to make it impossible to make the vote happen
They closed down the doors of the parliament and played sirens so Fidesz can't vote
Now let's see how this plays out, since as a Hungarian I truly believe we have a chance to finally, FINALLY, overthrow this shit government
English article about the law if anyone interested:
A little backstory
All our workers were sucked up by western europe
No one left in the country to work
It is just a modification of an wxisting law, they raised voluntary overtime from 250 to 400 hours
I sure love living here
Unfortunately, they probably won't
Acab dude
They are spiritless sheeps
All they do is attacking protesters who are alone
You should have seen their faces when the mass broke through their lines
you guys already have a shitload and will continue to get more of us (source: i will move out when i graduate too)
Actually u dont want to
The taxes are insane here
But not a bad idea tbh
Thanks brother ️
Fascists can really make people go totally blind
All you need is an imaginery enemy
Hate is actually really powerfull
Also fidesz manipulated the voting system by redrawing the borders of voting districts and they  developed their own program for counting votes
Sounds suspicious
Jobbik is currently part of the opposition
Let that sink in
They implemented a system called winner compensation
If you don't vote for the currently elected person or the second most popular canditate the vote automaticly goes to the currently elected person
This way they managed to get the 2/3 in the parliment with less then the 50% of actual votes
Hungary has low unemplyoment rate on paper
A lot of people do "public works" (according to google thats what it is called in English which is basically you are employed by the government to clean streets, parks, etc
It looks good on paper but barely pays and you can't live off of it
The problem is the other way around
There are serious workforce shortages in some sectors
The law slightly improves the situation for the time being
Ultimately though, it will encourage more people to work abroad instead
I didn't know Poland had any communists left
Well, its not a question o getting guilottined
If you think about it we are far past "crossing the rubicon", i would say the current regime passed it, when it decided to create a fresh tax to build footbal stadions to support the president's hobby, or when it decided that we needed to build a local trainnetwork around his home village, that is just sitting there doing nothing
Now we have the past neighbour and close friend of our prime minister achieving better growth rates in his ventures then when facebook vent public
If we want to be honest, its either create a soft dictatorship, with rule of "law", aka
changing the constitution on whim to suit you, or the possibility of spending decades in jail, as best option, and mobs hanging people from lamp post as worst
So its the damned if you do damned if you don't situation
In the sense that there is no going back
We will see
People here are not quite active
Yesterday was a good start but I dont know if it will last for more than one day
It won't, they control everything, election is just a play for funsies
He will be ruling until he dies, either natural cause or people hanging them from the Chain bridge
Well they passed it illegally, violating the parliamentary rules
Therefore the law is invalid
Yeah, escalating shit to public slaughter solves everything
###♫ OOOH SAY CAN YOU SEEEE
It has nothing to do with migrants
We dont have any problem with working, we have problem with working for free mostly for foreign companies
Also people ho were on the streets yesterday are generally supporting the idea of the quota system
Little funfact for you; hungary took in all the migrants that we were requited by the quota system, it is just not public so they can keep up their “fight against migrants and Gyorgy Soros” cause it helps them keep people on their side
I hope you see things a bit clearer now my friend
Imagine re founding companies every 2,5 years and hireing everyone again so they wont have to pay at the end of 3 years
Good days ahead
I dont think there is  a good option at the monent
Btw the labor law is just a rubber bone for the media and the massses
It allows passing laws to centralize the judicial system, and put it under direct political control
Which is the main goal, the labor law is as important as the "internet tax" was a few years ago
That guillotine thing that I keep hearing about sounds okay
Exactly
Yes they seem ok, but there are some concern that they are closer to Fidesz than it seems at first glance
They are too small tbh
Also there are some conflicts in the prty which is not great either
Average wage in Hungary is around €700 a month after tax
You can rent a small one bedroom flat in Budapest for around €300 plus utilities
Won't be a very nice one and certainly not in the city centre but still
And outside Budapest everything is a lot cheaper
You can't really live off just government assistance, it's simply not enough
Luckily this is totally false in every way
The only similarity that their leader looks like Orban 30 years ago (this is what most people say) :D
Ah i see
He's a man of culture as well
That wasnt work of real weebs
That was just some random idiot who watched pokemon and naruto, and googled up anime girl on the net
A weeb is a completely peaceful entity, only drawn 2D anime children should be afraid of them, but not the 3D ones
The weebs are fine with homosexual rights, transgenders, because they also love the ''traps'', or transgender anime characters
They can unite easily, in the attack on titan face and reddit group i usually chat with arabs, indians, vietnamese people, and not with other europeans
But there are signs of radicals also
But i see more communist content
Memes about the soviets, lenin, etc
There are half (or not only half) fascist (first of all in aot groups) also, but there's more far-leftists content
Google up r/animemes flag
You'll see communist and anarchist symbols
(Lel meanwhile i'm kinda liberal, not a nationalist, but not a big socialist either
Nope
Not all far right s the american flavour of nutjob, the christian KKK flavoured nutjob
And people like him, or our Orban, don't translate well abroad
They are just generic authoritarians, they don't lean heavily right or left
However ours LOVES to act in  way that whips up contraversy abroad - as attacks on him abroad low him to fashion himself as a revolutionary fighting the "big evil interantional whatever shadow power", and keep his revolutionary image he gained shortly after te end of comunism
No one said all weebs are this or that
But as you confirmed, there are radical weebs, one of whom made that poster
Also, no it is not just someone that saw pokemon or naruto when he was 10, the background anime girl is Rem from Re:Zero, a pretty recent and popular anime
Underrated video
This should be the first thing to pop up, before you log in to twitter
Also Hitler was socialist, but he was extreme cultural right
I know
But can you imagine her saying it
If they want someone from that show beatrice would be the  best choice
Not Rem
If i were them i'd choose cornelia li britannia from code geass
Or mari kurihara from prison school
Edit: lel i tought it was the guy from sweden, but its a fellow hungarian
What do U think, personally, that someone in hungary made something like that
Doesn't matter who they chose exactly
They made it purely for the keks
I'm pretty indifferent
It's a meme with obvious racist content, which is dangerous but the intent is probably not direct racism, but memeing
In that regard it's a distasteful one and luckily it got removed pretty fast
If I were a gypsy I would obviously be very hurt by it, but since I am not I can't pretend to be, and neither will or can I defend it
edit: Also, pointinh out that someone >in Hungary< made that, isn't a surprise
Hungary is generally very openly racist towards gypsies, and highly racist otherwise as well
Economic socialist, not cultural
The pre war economy was planned
Small buisnisses were limited and monopolies' power were decreased
Hmm
okay
Kinda agreed
(Meh your english is so much better than mine
XDXD)
:) Don't sweat it, yours is way better than how most Hungarians speak English
And I'm completely sure that in some years you'll speak it fluent as fuck
Mark my words
Well yes, not overall socialist
The parts of the economy were only changed, when Hitler tought it's wrong
Most of the neo nazis today are economic centrist
I pointed out, that I only talk about economy here
Economic leftism most of the time is associated with cultural leftism
Also why tf I'm getting downvoted
Yeah I know, that was a mistake from my part
I meant, that, if you are socialist then you are most likely progressive
But not always
This oddly looks like an Assassin's Creed map
A few months ago I saw this comment on r/ukpolitics and it sums up this situation pretty well:
>Well most modern Neo Nazis are also the kind of people the Nazis would put into camps or castrate for being a bit daft
Im not saying that these people are fucking stupid
but they are fucking stupid
It doesn't just insult Poland and Polish heroes and victims
It insults Nazis as well
Now that's a feat
roflmao
R/pics
didnt the Danish do this with pigs
yeap:
Which one is the new PM again
So long, and thanks for all the fish
You can suck my banker, globalist balls t_D.
*This comment was sponsored by the George Soros Foundation*
Thank you frenchies
So eu is a go
As a Hungarian, my sincere condolences to anyone who wants to take the train here
My dad used to think about the US as a country where civil rights are still a thing
He used to think that it is the one country that Europe can rely on once things here go to shit, because this was how my grandpa raised him during the communist occupation of Hungary
The US used to be basically a beacon of hope
Sad to see that his whole world view is crumbling
Stayed the same because I expected this sort of madhouse
Anyways, the statistics seems [hella distorted]
Poland explain yourself
Hmm, not sure which is the worse
All it did to me is solidify my suspicion that Trump is legit retarded
> He used to think that it is the one country that Europe can rely on
&#x200B;
>because this was how my grandpa raised him during the communist occupation of Hungary
...after 56, when NATO supported an imperialistic war along the suez canal, instead of a bona fide revolution in hungary
...that kind of ally was not different from the USSR at all
>but they were instrumental to Europe's safety during the cold war
If you mean that they created nuclear weapons first, thus France, UK, and the USSR copied from tehm, then sure, they created the nuclear peace
But only coincidentally - as they are very anti-proliferation
These are my thoughts exactly
In the end no country will make an effort that is not in their best interests
I find this sad as well
I think the WU holds great potential, but first the bureaucracy needs to be reduced
As for the moving part of your comment
I have learned to speak German and plan on learning to speak Swedish/Norwegian in the next three years to keep my options open
Wow, this is something else
So much wasted potential because these are really interesting surveys indeed
Fair enough
Well yes
However same is true about North Korea being warm and welcoming toward deserting US soldiers
Finally
Who is the next one
Wonder if we will need to wait for this long
I wish it could be the same case in Hungary
It's ridiculous what's happening there
Around Orban's, Meszaros' and the other guys
But as I know, it's also a trouble that who would be the next one after Fidesz
Cause i heard that the opposition parties are incompetent
viva la revolucion
Only 5 in russia
I thought there would be more
I absolutly adore how every time either Romania or Hungary gets mentioned somewhere, both of them instantly appear and play a verbal 1v1
We both should shut the fuck up already and live in peace lol
Our great-grandparents fought against each other, in communist times our grandparents and parents have been incited against each other, and now all of our living ancestors, great-grandparents, grandparents, parents AND the effin' governments are telling us to hate each other
How about we break this cycle, because we don't have a fucking reason to keep going
Let the boomers fight alone, if they want to (like they did in Uz valley a couple of months ago over a fucking graveyard)
Romanians are some crazy mofos when it comes to driving, when they get on our highways they drive like there’s no tomorrow, both trucks and cars
Nincs Románia
I don't care about the music, it is the cars they are driving on the highway from Germany to Romania
Here is a van that was driven home after an accident:
Another one on a trailer with a funny hookup solution:
A cargo Mercedes solution (it is a piano in the back):
Another cargo solution:
Another cargo solution (the Mercedes pulls a trailer van, which pulls another trailer):
Truck pulls trailer, trailer pulls audi, audi pulls another trailer:
I don't envy their guardian angels
I mean, we Hungarians had our fair share with fridges on the top of the trabants in the late 80's, but it was nowhere this bad
Well Romanians towing way too much with way too shitty trailers is a thing in Hungary now :D
Yes, with their diy trailers, at least in Hungary
\+pirosarany 5
Look at least he admits it
In Hungary this is very popular among young adults and gypsies as well
Sort of the last
Not actually hate but they think they are a third group who have been just used by both sides for their goals
Which if you think about it isn't so far from truth
Well it’s usually related to education or just the neighborhood they grew up in or the area where they come from
Based
It will be a civil war in Poland
Do you know any good anti-vaccine music
"Do you know who I am
We already have packages for different sites (facebook, etc
) here in Hungary
You just don't pay extra for them, instead they are free and you pay more for the rest, but the same thing
Not in your country
Hungarian grape producers got paid serious money to eradicate their grape production
The contract stops them from regrowing plants for 5 or so years on them lands
Many producing companies (sugar for example) got bought out and got closed down
I'm sure there are plenty more
Maybe they are not connected to big corporations, but the event is precedent in the EU as well
They should have invested in agriculture, but growing other crops
There still are serious aids toward certain plants (or livestock in some areas I guess)
I don't dare to check cattle stock in Hungary for the last 15 years
EU membership killed the whole milk production here in mid 2000s.
I really hope history is being written today
Single syllable river is such a bullshit though
Yeah, well, Budapest's river is *two* syllables
Excuse me, I'll have you know it's two syllables
It doesn't apply to Budapest
It does apply to Bratislava though
This decision sucks
How hard would it be to change the constitution based on a citizen initiative and refferendum ?
Based poland
doubt the abortion part
Orban knows he won't get more wotes out of it
kind of doubt the anti-LGBT part as well (yes, I've read the telex article) but I'd rather put my money on the "gypsies problem"
I think his crimes are not that well known
I'm a simple Hungarian
I see Slovakia, I like
According to the official site, [koronavirus
gov
hu] more than 1400 tests were made
Crabs
Nice, but I've said it before: whatever the US does we must care about Europe and make sure we can take care of our own problems
We must get our shit together
I like a friendly US, we have a lot in common
But that's all
Erdogan is gonna have a rougher time after this
Well, hold your horses
Trump lost, true
Biden won, also true
But did the US Average Joe win
...unlikely
Lets have a short lesson on contemporary politics of Hungary
...once upon a time this chap named Ferenc Gyurcsány won the "presidency" (became prime minister), acted like Trump, did the [retarded media impression
] people more than had their fill with him
Thus Orban got elected, seen as the "lesser evil" even by moderate left, and as the second coming of god by the right
...look where we are at today
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Due to the small rabid fansbase that Trump retains, it plausible that he will try to take part in Republican politicking, which can easily lead to the party imploding
And making any sort of opposition to democrats impossible
Which leaces the states with a demnocrat party that can act like if it were the communist party of the USSR
Can't wait to see our Trump-butt licking prime ministers suddenly have a change of heart
>I don't think Trumpism is gone
Biden won by the thinnest of margins and Trump will absolutely make a stink going out
If my countries history is anything to go by Trump is a dead man walking
As in his biggest challenge will be to secure a grave site where people won't find a way to shit and spit on it
We had a similar leader in Gyurcsány Ferenc of the ["we fucked up speech"] fame
He is now a perfect political chip for Orban to get away with whatever he wants
As he is always part of the opposition, and makes plenty of people uncomfortable with that
I would expect the democrats acting to make ABSOLUTELY sure, that Trump won't go to jail, and continues a very tragic political career
As that will allow them to make republicans implode, and do whatever they please
Considering we are talking about polticians that expression needs to sound a lot more scary
>let's just hope that Trump quits the White House on peaceful terms
Lets ope democrats won't abuse the fact that Trump is a republican with a loyal irraional fanbase
It could lead to shattering the Republicans, and an effective on party state
Thats how we ended up with Orban after the [öszöd speech]
Which is the exact same thing we said when we elected Orbán, after Gyurcsány "[we fucked up] Ferenc
The opposite
The democrat warmongers are back in power, matter of time before they start bombing the shit out of the Middle East again
Then Erdogan will once again blackmail the EU for money for stopping the flood of refugees, or he'll release them to Europe
...keep in mind, that Orban got elected for the first time as the "lesser of the two evils" after the ["We fucked up speech"]
Nah, he's from their tribe so he's flawless
Just like Trump was for many Republicans
> It shows that despite Trump is (politically) dead, Trumpism is not
>I think that this result is probably better for the Republican party
We had the same situation here, with Ferenc Gyurcsány imploding the left (Trump will likely implode the right), and now we have Orban
Should we be happy
...i wouldn't be so optimistic about an extremely destabilized political spectrum in a two party state
>Finally some fucking good news in 2020
We had the same feelings when Orban won after the ["Öszöd speech"]
Lets just say "don't count the chickens beforre they are hatched
>Thank fuck, now abolish the electoral college and introduce more than two parties or the issue will remain until you do
The issue is the "first past the post" voting system mathematically enforcing a two party state, unless one of the two parties implod
Like here in Hungary after the [Öszöd speech] that perfectly describes the party that made Orbán win, and the opposition implode
...wait till your saviour turns out to be somehow worse
That's how we got Orban
>As a pro eurasian I'm happy, With this election Turkey will be able to leave Nato
...well its a nice dream
However on has to be very high ot believe it
(Keep in mind its not unlikely that Hungary would tag along with you, if the plan wouldn't be suicide
Turkey is not a major power
It completely lacks its own industry thats necessary to fight its own wars
Drone striking the hell out of armenia, is a lot less impressive when you cannot produce key parts domestically
Fighting without night vision and heat sensors is fighting blind this day and age
&#x200B;
>make an alliance with Russia and China
If we do this we can prevail all region
China and Russia are NOT allies of each other
The tag along against the states for sure
However both seeks to utterly dominate
A strong Turkey is incompatible with the plans of either of them
One cannot allow a country with working politics and a decent army, the other cannot stomach one that isn't in a debt trap
If only Orban was good
I mean Dems/their sympathisers are just as petty as childish as Trump, so I say they deserve it
Its only fair
>If they’re ignored again they’ll make sure another Trump gets elected next time - and next time he might be competently evil
You are delusional
Everyone is a hero in his own story
There is no such thing as evil, only people who see the world in black and white, and crusade to unmake black
&#x200B;
>Someone needs to stand for these people and help them, otherwise things are going to get worse
Things wont get worse in the way you think
Trump lost all but the irrational core voterbase
However the demcorats gained the best ally in Trump
The useless idiot who makes the republican party completely unpalatable
This could easily lead to the republicans imploding
And history repeating what happend in my country after the [Öszöd Speech]
This can easily mean democrats with UNCHECKED power for a decade - and we are talking aout career poltiicians, don't get your hopes up
Still can't believe System of a Down released 2 new songs before Cyberpunk got released
Cmon CDPR
The fact that GOP did diddle all to improve their situation, doesn't mean that people didn't vote for them out of desperation
It means that got scammed, as it tends to happen with voters in representative demcoracies
Campaign seasons promises and action tend to have nothign in common
&#x200B;
>long they persevere in their crusade to make the lives of those they despise even more miserable than their own
No one is out there doing the evil laugh, and marking tasks the managed on the "evil overlord to do list".
Everyone is the hero of his/her own story
If you honestly think there is good and evil side to politics you are deeply deluded
And not much better than the crusaders who said "God will know his own" before slaughtering cities that hosted heretic christians
The right got scammed
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
And expect the left, to make most out of the right having Trump as a party member
The "i am not Trump" card will be played into oblivion, and will allow people to get away what some shit that is arguably sketchier than what Trumo did
(Yes, that is how politics in Hungary work since the defeat of our scandalous [Gyurcsány "we fucked up " Ferenc] and Orbán is milking everything out of that situation)
It would be better
However the people who have power are not interested in creating rivals, and a political landscape where its harder to win
After all its much easier to gain votes for a big party, if your side doesn't have small parties
Since the democrats are unaffected by Trump, they can abuse the political vacuum, and the terrible reputation of republicans to create a de facto one party state (even if its not de jure, in practice it matters little)
Why would the demcorats not (ab)use said once in a lifetime opportunity
>Turkey is important for Russia because of straits and mediterranean and Turkey is important for China because of Economic
Turkey is Russia's cuba
Ofc
its important for Russia, when its hosting the nuclear armaments of the big opposing nuclear power
Doesn't mean that Russia wnts to be your ally, or is willing to live with a non-fucked up Turkey
Turkey always will be in a geopolitical psoition where it threatens Russia if its strong, and allies with an opposing major power
Similarly to what Cuba is to the states
And if Turkey conforms to Russia's wishes, expect it to be in a state like today's Cuba, not some kind of utopia
&#x200B;
>You are right but, you are wrong too
I know, Turkey isn't a super super super power but, Turkey is one of the big powers in mediterranean and middle east
Turkey's military power is strong and also Turkey has military bases over 10 countries in these areas and with military power Turkey has influence on these countries
I completely agree that Turkey is one of the big regional powers in the middle east
It is perfectly capable of going toe to toe with states like Iran or Saudi Arabia
As its one of the two powers in siad region (Isreal being the other one) with competent military personnel, and a healthy military culture - in the sense that it doesn't sabotage its own ability to wage war
Most arabic states have enormous issues on that front
Iran's early WWI era strategy in the Iraq-Iran war also not somethin to brag about, that was obsolete by 1917, long before the first world war ended
To put the military situation of the middle east in perspective, the whole region ganged up to beat Israel and failed miserably, multiple times
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
There is no "easternmediterranean" there is only mediterranean
We are definietly not living in the era of the battle of lepanto where it took months for fleets to travel from one edge to the other, if the wind favoured them
Furthermore if Turkey starts attacking Eu countries, or frankly any democratic country on he continent it will catch a lot of international flak
You can sneakily muck around in the civil wars of the ex-soviet republics of central asia, and near east no problem
As said states have pretty much zero power, little in the way of meaningful allies, and were already at war
Winning a military conflict for the control of the eastern half of the mediterranean is not just "beating greece".
And nothing like the invasion of Cyprus
Which was an invasion where you had 4-10 times numerical superiority, against a defense force that was largely a militia
Frankly it was as serious a military campaign as the Argentinian invasion of the falklands
Yeah, it would be surprising to see you fail to take it
However its not a feat that will make others tremble at the sight of your military might
&#x200B;
To win the east mediterranean you need to win submarine warfare, and the air over it
Which would require you to win a land war in the balkans, i fail to see how thats something Turkey is able to achieve
I'm rooting for all the people in Belarus
Your beautiful country deserves better <3
What kind of dictator doesn't simply drone or carpet-bomb protesters
Fucking weaksauce
lol, nothing will happen
We've seen thousands of these anti government protests the past few years but they never went anywhere
EDIT: Downvoted for not hopping on the reddit hype train
Yeah man, it should be Velence
At least it's not the Hungarian flag
I usually laugh when they mistake Slovakia and Slovenia but this
De putain
At least I know where all that rampant stupidity comes from
To be honest in Europe you are free to be as ignorant and arrogant too, just somewhy in USA you can be proud of it
To be fair its a very inclusive EU map
It has 3 other continents in it
Not to mention historical importance
Iowas contribution to the world isnt really comparable to Italy or France
I don't think that's the Maine problem
I had to look up if I was making up that word or it really exists because of your comment lol
except that zoos are closed for a year and struggling to survive, there was cases where even wealthy countries had to feed carnivores with the herbivores from the zoo, and also hunting and fishing isnt stopped, so its just worse for them now
Not to mention the Brexiters' railing about the unelected EU burocrats meaning the EU Council, which is made up of PMs
Hungary, the place where you only see grass, the home of the Alföld
Sweden is nice
The Netherlands smoked em all
Gesundheit
Hungary is actually not that bad
Most of the country is on the Pannonian Basin and trees are not growing there naturally
And we have to fight invasive tree species for screwing up that ecosystem
Also at least in Hungary's case, 70% of the country is forested steppe, so the forest cover was naturally never really high
This is really sad use of polish taxpayer money
Hope you guys can win this, Lukasehnko's power is already crumbling
You can see how the countries with the worse leadership think better about America
As a hungarian (which I am) it is pretty sad to see this
I was expecting way worse from Hungary considering I've encountered so many people sharing Trump's ideas
Even my parents, who oppose our current government consider the US's system fine
They only get the news from Hungarian sources mostly, they viewed the US as that dream place ever since communism ended
The idea that it's not Hungary means that it must be a better place in their heads
Like, I always get weirded out by the MAGA people then realize what kind of people the FIDESZ supporters can be, still, so many years later yelling Soros
But, the US system does work **BETTER** than ours
I'm certain the US has roads you can drive on, we too have, some
You know the joke that if an American is drunk they are driving left and right, but if a Hungarian is sober they drive left and right between potholes, but if they are drunk they just drive through them
Even the little money you got through the pandemic is more than the big fat 0 we got
The US minimum wage is dream wage here
It doesn't matter for many that your rent is higher or some stuff are more expensive, we just see that you got money from the government, you have an "insanely high" minimum wage
That's enough for many of us to say that "yeah, the US system works well".
I'm not defending the results, but when you compare the US system to the one in Poland/Hungary you'd also say the US is probably better
Of course Hungary and Poland think it's fine
cmao
Most of us are fffing stupid, man
I wish that we had a better government
I mean with my limited knowledge of the political system I think there's nothing conspicuously wrong with it
I think they have very effective systems to avoid tyranny and to ensure the fundamental right(s) to liberty for citizens
They had a bad leader and just got rid of him the next election
We've been struggling with ours for a decade now
All the recent controversies concerning the US were related to the public being not reasonable/uneducated/fierce and not to the political system
I mean if anyone, we know when a broken political system, and compared to us the US system works miraculously well
You can acrually vote people out of office, which is becoming increasingly difficult
To me the US system is a lot less broken than what we have in Hungary, so it is *comparatively* less broken
"Well, it's better than here so who cares
Not much surprise
In Hungary, we're basically heading towards a two party system
The liberal side are working together in their hate against Orbán, but I think it's a really unstable alliance without a real and competent leader, only held together by the Orbán-hate
So it's basically FIDESZ against everyone, except of course the minor parties, among which maybe one or two makes it in the Parliament
Why oh why
How can we let this happen
uhh, im not even surprised
on the other hand from the outside it seems better than ours, at least Usa has max 8 years, then no matter what, president is out
meanwhile we will have Orban for another 20-30 years
well, US has at least 2 parties to vote on
in Hungary you have Orbán
at least Poland sucks US dicks, not Putin and China
lesser evil
Do you even know what fascism is
Look up 1930’s  and 40’s italy or germany for reference, then look around in poland and hungary
These countries are hybrid regimes at best
As a Hungarian  I second this
Also it is strange that there is no data about the other post-soviet countries
I think it can be a cultural difference too between old and fairly new ‘democratic’ countries but they didn’t show enough data to prove it
indeed
I wish we could just throw out Orban and friends after 8 years
I'm hungarian and I heard Romania is catching up
Doesn't matter
Life is better
It doesn't matter how many parties there are cause in hungary every single party is full of crooks, and no matter who is elected nothing is getting fixed
Just the same old snailpace  improvement that'll take 30-40 years to show any improvement
Hungary's latest voting system is greatly affected by the thoughts of some american specialists hired by the governing party
This shithole is the worst place I've ever been
Ive lost hope for both the country, and it's people
Coming back here was worst mistake of my life
We mustn't give up
They want us to lose hope but we mustn't! Apathy is one of the biggest problems in Hungary
The biggest problems are the lack of opportunities
The egos on some people, and an outdated mindset that no longer works in the modern world
I don't see how the last part will ever be doctored as young people leave
Well, it's true that it's an awful situation, and there are several problems
But there must be a way out
I don't yet know how
There is a way out
Wait about 20-30 years, then an additional 10
We do something
Aren't there like millions of people who are disgusted and outraged by what they our doing to our country
I don't know the exact number, but let's go with 3 million
Let's say the tenth of these people start protesting
That would still be huge
Why can't this happen
Bannworthy opinion: Antifa (and related extreme leftist direct action groups) are not any better
Based
Why cannot one equally hate antifa & nazis
Why does on have to be friends be Either with nazis, or with left wing extremists
...if you ask a communist USA citizens are fascists
...if you ask a 'Murican, then anyone even contemplating state sponsored healthcare is a fascist
By that logic i am one, jsut like all other living people
I would like to hear a sane, and coherent argument why i am fascist for despising people who sucker punch others with padlock, and commit arson on random people property (instead against the fascists they hate)
Anyone disagreeing with the methods of antifa is fascist
So if i despise people swinging padlocks at others heads i am fascist
P.s.: maybe consider, that people who advocate for murder and vandalims are evil, not the ones who dare to raise voice against it
...maybe the world is not white and black, but a spectrum of grey
Let me be clear
I don't like people semi-military groups marching down my street waving flags, and committing attrocities
I don't like disorganised mobs doing the same thing either
I fail to see how that qualifies as fascism
What if i don't like violent activism aither
As antifa advocates that, and i deeply despise it
Exactly as deeply as violent actions by right wingers
I like peace, rule of law & civilized behaviour
...yeah, what an ignorant attitude
Daring to not wanting to gt murdered by anyone, or my property destroyed for shits and giggles by anyone, regardless of political narrative, even if they are THE ANTIFA
Thats the pinnacle of fascism
>Violence for no reason isn't justified, and it should be criticized when it happens
just beware that fascists are absolutely able to come to power through peace, rule of law and civilized behaviour, and they're not gonna respect the exact things you value should that happen
They could
Sadly "fascist" has been used to describe everyone's opposition, as such everyone is antifascist
And sadly the "its just violence against fascist" can be used to justify violence against anyone
Which is what i deeply dislike about the whole clusterfuck
...well there is that infamous bike padlock incident, among others, and billion dollars worth of damage caused by vandals enabled by black block tactics
Ofc
All ANTIFA members are always inocent
As every crime ever committed during a black block protest, is done by far right elements trying to discredit you with false flag attack
As we all know ANTIFA member are physically incapable of harming others, let alone innocents
By antifa, i mean the antifa roganization
If you mean people who disagree with those groups by the label fascist, then fascist (defined by you), do what you not expect them to do
Purely due to your insane expectations
If you redefine fascist as people who oppose violence and vandalism, then following your redefinition, fascist (the members of the group defined by you) will oppose violence and vandalism
&#x200B;
...is it so fucking hard to grasp, that when you brand EVERYONE who doesn't support mob vigilantism as fascist, then most peace loving folks will be branded fascism in your deluded mind
I was wondering what the vaccine scar on my husband was
He couldn’t remember so this is good to know
Love it when Germans act honestly
First I legit thought it was a cave painting
Wishing you the best Bulgarian brothers
I mean yeah, the mafia should be kicked out from the leadership but there's a pamdemic going on
Hungary protested like this for 3 and a half years until the national election day came
The failed party acted like there was nothing wrong and promptly vetod every attempt for a new election te be held earlier
I expect the same of Bulgaria
I hope people keep it up until the next election
Happy cake day, friend
N'wah
I'm impressed how the most recent islamist extremism was reacted to by the French government
Europe has to prepare for a much more vocal, honest confrontation with terrorists that cannot cope with our very very very basic rights such as free speech
Lest we forget
While the claim is coming from a biased source, it would not surprise me if it was true
Engineers accidentally left a coffee stain on the plans and the construction guys did not dare to question it
"these protest were organized by Soros to distract us from what's really important before the voting: immgration" ~FIDESZ
Are you sure they are not protesting against the shitty weather in Köln

We feel you man…
Kind of makes sense, state television is cancer
Cries in Hungarian
Hungary:
* Párbeszéd: Socialism
Thunberg
* MSZP: Socialism
* LMP: Thunberg
Liberalism
* DK: Liberalism
* Momentum: Liberalism
* Jobbik: Covert racists
* Fidesz: Overt racists
* KDNP:  Christians who are bible-thumpers and overt racists
* Mi Hazánk: Overt racists, probably not actually "independent"
* MKKP: Free beerism and IDDQD
> less parties in the gov with more stability and more efficiency
Yes, of course
And Poland was even more stable and efficient when only one party existed
Jesus
KDNP tried that in Hungary, it was adopted and then revoked in a year because in practice it was dumb AF
We got two great youtube songs out of it though
Wow
just wow
I like it how everyone has proper full name and capitalisation while Biden is just "US presented BIDEN" shouting xD
Rest of the world: Fuckin dying
Europe: dUcKs
DIGI
Upc/Vodafone
It's similar here in Hungary
I pay 10 euro for up to 1000mbs and always get 750+ with digi (it's a Romanian company)
Similar in Hungary
All about regulations, competition is pretty wild
We pay 10-11€ for 500/250 in Hungary
Weird how our salaries are lower, but we pay less for internet
and kinda pay more for everything else
Where did I say our salary is lower than Romania
What I said is how WE get less, but pay less for internet, but pay more for others
You look like the happiest person on Earth
That's genuine joy
Hope you achieve everything else you want to
Then you really scored in life, congrats
:-)
You can't make this law good tho
It will be always harmful to the end users
Only the big companies will benefit from it
I wouldn't be surprised if Sony and other big (mainly music) publishers paid the EU a bit
Seriously, why can't we have leaders like her in every EU country
Why do we have to suffer through the seemingly endless supply of stupid heinous crooks
Damn
She is a true leader of Europe and a very good politician
I just love the way she explains stuff, some politicians have a very characteristic way of talking and she is certainly one of those
Can't we have a Hungarian Merkel
Like our whole opposition can't show up with 1 competent (or not total idiot) politician
For hells sake, Fleto is leading our biggest opposition party
I mean, Trump only wants to build a wall on the Mexican border
We have an ocean there, which is clearly superior /s
Apparently we can't.
Even if we could, and somehow he/she could lead a party to a successful election (which would be near impossible considering how heavily it's skewed towards Fidesz), taking over the government of the country in it's current state would be political suicide
Assuming we'd get the best and most capable government the world has ever seen, it would take decades to get back to a reasonably healthy level and start building again
That means decades of political stability and actual progress without Fidesz ever coming back
Can you imagine that happening where there is Orban crooks literally everywhere and you would have to fight them every step of the way
I know I can't.
I may have low standards since Hungarian politicians have the rethoric skills of an introverted toad
Most likely she wants to retire
Leading a country for 15 years
That's something
But if not, we would be happy to take her as PM
Every economical block has its most prominent politicians who could be called de facto "leaders". They usually have a lof of soft power
And Merkel certainly qualifies for this
I think the only chance for Hungary is after-Orbán. He is Fidesz, without him the party is nothing but a bunch of old racist idiots (safe for a few people, but they would fight among each other)
I think Fidesz will loose eventually
They will win 2022 closely and (assuming they don't take a turn) they will loose 2026
Orbán is getting old and his supporters are getting less and less numerous every day
(since the avrage voter of him isn't the younger generations)
Now the problem is that what if he takes a turn again
He went from liberal, to center right, to far right, to Christian conservative
He changes colours very very fast indeedm
Let me rephrase it: The most significant leader in Europe currently, who has the most influence in EU politics
>holds no influence over any country but her own
I would argue she very much does, in the economical sphere of Germany (so eastern Europe) she does have a big influence
>not liked or respected by great many people in Europe
Sure, but even a President of a country isn't respected by great many people
Orbán undoubtedly is powerful here, but belive me Hungarians don't like him
Liking someone has nothing to do with anything
But that doesn’t have to do with leaving the EU
Hyvä Suomi
You do realise that the rumor was that he wanted them to make the vaccine be only available in the US
That is a little bit more serious than just stealing our specialists to work there
Regardless of the greater potential implications this was just a meme and you went all conspiracy theory over it
They watched to much maffia or what
I had this happen to me once, almost took my thumb with it
We live in a period
Interesting how it is stalinism but not communism
Seems a wee bit biased
I mean I guess it makes sense in the way that Molotov served under Stalin
Interesting

Oh I just got a text message that my social credits have been reduced to 0
Oh I got another one that says I won a free vacation in China paid by Xi Jinping

That’s why it’s only 40 pictures
Otherwise it looked “funky”.
Unfortunately I didn’t save that version

bruh
>assumes everyone uses UK spelling
*Highly suspect*
omg I just thought of the funniest shit
The plans were made by hungarians, just saying
thats some proper ganda right there
Japan
as a hungarian who born in the 80’s only, fuck ussr and the soviets and their liberation
same level of shit as nazis were, just different colors
What is this
What the hell is this
Fun fact: no civilisation ever used the duodecimal system, despite the widespread use of _dozen_ in measurements
Some small languages have eleven and twelve among their digits, but they didn't use a positional notation numeral system
What do you have against it
Other than clocks looking a bit uglier
When you have a physical object, cutting it in half is easy, cutting it in five pieces, not so much
That's why americans love to use base 2 fractions
However they also often use thirds and twelveths to make things more confusing
_20 minutes_ would just become _30 minutes_ and we wouldn't really care about the 3⅓ minutes lost
We hungarians wouldn't, but i have a feeling that germans would
In Hungary we call them "fánk"
Naon pacek
And we don’t have a day for it we have a 40 day period called”farsang” before Easter
Fun fact, we have Gluttonous Thursday right _after_ Lent starts on Ash Wednesday, when you’re meant to eat until you hate yourself
A lot of restaurants offer heavy discounts on this day
No, Farsang is the period between Epiphany Day (6 Jan) and Shrove Tuesday
As of Ash Wednesday, up until Easter it’s 40 days of Lent
As a Hungarian, I can confirm that we stand on each other's heads

Hungary is the least worrying
Jokes aside, the fuck is up with searching how to kill people and how they taste
Following that logic, it's more like halfway in; it's the most popular search among those that are not popular enough to be available in their language
The last time I googled something like that, it was for a short story I was writing
We have 28°C here and it's already too much
How the fuck do you survive 40+?
r/demotorization
And people say it’s crazy that Poland and Hunary are promoting Christian values
Sure it has it’s downsides, but secularism simply not working
Very impressive mental gymnastics you got here
That’s the thing
Secularism worked fine until it has been used mostly on Christians and Jews
In theory it should have worked with any kind of religion, but when Muslims came in to the picture shit went wrong
In fact it does not
They are still there after several hours

Well usually you can tell the gender from the whole or surrounding sentences so it's unnecessary
Our language is still fucking komplex and weird though
You dont understand
Its critical that we have 30 cases
I honestly never understood why gendered pronouns still exist in English
They're pretty much the only remnants of the past relationship of English with grammatical genders
They got rid of gendered articles and gender-based declension of adjectives ages ago, but they still insist on differentiating between he and she
why
We can also leave out the verb (as you've seen in this post), subject (often do that) and there are even one word sentences

Protest in Hungary for the freedom of press
Also the majority of the editorial staff of basically the last major independent outlet (Index) have walked out on their job today
It's absolutely wild to see momentum (progressives) and Jobbik (nationalists) flags side by side
Nothing will change
We will swallow this like everything else in the past decade
What's that, like a couple thousand people
Tops
In a country of 10 million
As if that's gonna change anything
And no, I did not go out either, and no, I do not have an excuse for that
This seems to be the prevailing mindset here: keep your head low, do not get into trouble and maybe those with power will let you live your little life in peace
lol wtf I didn't even know this was happening
I mean shit
I don't watch news
So what’s the purpose of the protest
Isn’t it too late
Corona liked this post
Bruh I'm also from Hungary but this is nonsence
There IS freedom of press in Hungary
Index was a terrible news site, with misleading titles and clickbaits also they also were sued a cuple of times because they were pisting false news
I can't make any sence ot of this protest other that some mainstream trend
And also it's a fact that Momentum (as a party) is founded by Gyorgy Soros
How about no
Not the majority, the entire staff now, except the ones on vacation
I am a hungarian, and after Index closing, i don't really know where to read independent news
*"independent"*
It's a sign
If we want change, we have to keep together
Enemy of my enemy
Jobbik is not nationalist any more
All the radicals left and founded Mi Hazánk (which is according to some people paid by Fidesz in the background
Jobbik is not nationalist anymore
Momentum is not progressive, they're just anti-fidesz, but not progressives
Sadly, Hungarians will stop protesting the moment it starts raining - source: I'm a Hungarian and that's how the last protest wave ended
Well, we protested in 2018 for 1-2 weeks every day and nobody cared
There was some teargas and police action too
And the major problem with this, that this is unfortunately not a joke
This is the intolerable reality  of our government
Ah that actually made me laugh good one
He will fall, and that fall will allow Hungary to be a true democracy
Like the way Slovakia did
It will happen in time
> Harder than anyone before
The USSR: Am I a joke to you
They did use tear gas in the end of 2018
This protest doesn't plan on going near the parliament building but from what I have heard the riot police already surronded the building just in case
Nah, Orbán's approach is more like "Ignore it and people will eventually have to work"
They literally killed the last independent news source that was also a big part of hungarian internet culture
At least the protestors here wear masks, not ARs :D
Somehow it went away for the protests in the USA so let's hope that applies here too
Well
During the quarantine most of the patients were kicked out from the hospitals
Many people died bcoz of this idiot decision
Yes, you read it well
This happened a few months ago
No, Orbán's tactic is literally "waiting it out"
Everyone knows how the big is the risk, but sometimes you have to act
Yeah, we haven't had a revolution in fifty years, it is time for another
Not with that attitude it won't change
The election in 2018 was rigged so we don't have many chance
They fragmented to a Nazi (Mi Hazánk) and a centrist (Jobbik) part
You can find pictures on 444
hu and HVG
This, but unironically
> i don't really know where to read independent news
Magyar Hang and 444
are both pretty good, the first one also has printed version
Here is the English Article from Index:
Hope this provides some context
He is blamed globally
Macedonia, Malaysia, USA the list goes on
Right wingers love to blame him especially
He is the target of all the attacks of FIDESZ, because they say he is going to settle immigrants in our lands
They call this the "Soros-plan".
Well they sort of legalized corruption in Romania so they take the cake here for sure
Also HVG, 24
hu and Átlátszó which does investigative journalism
But don't fall for the Azonnali meme
That is owned by Ungár who is the son of Schmidt Mária and who managed to destroy LMP
Not the 444, they are too onesided
Yes, but i want hungarian news too
They have been dependent on indamedia financially for a long time now
They let go of the person who ensuredd that they are independent in terms of articles
He wants to stay in the EU because while he Hungary is in the EU he can simply steal money
Not like it matters though
They're always going to be the ex-fascist party
Origo did mention that Gyurcsány made Index collapse as an effort to push Momentum out or something
True
We are very *__fucked__*
We are really brother nations in everything

No, as long as I can't see gesturing hands

It's just another fake pretense that the EPP likes
Hungary and Poland will still get the money because the EPP benefits from authoritarian moneysinking shitholes
The important bit is that what they mean by rule of law and how this works exactly will be discussed later
Edit: All the downvoters will see that I am right
Just wait a few years and watch
Literally no fundings will be cut as long as it's the EPP
That's why they have to push even harder for cutitng fundings and have exact definition for rule of law
Of course they will never do that as long as EPP and their politicians are in power
As you can see they haven't been pushing hard enough, this whole rule of law thing has been worthless for years because no one comes down hard on it
And when a country was struck as hard by covid as Italy or Spain I am pretty sure they will spend a lot on relief
Great

In fact most of the darkest deeds of the last century were carried out by organizations that saw religion as an enemy

Victory easily achivable with a little gerrymandering in such case
I think it's hungary, fidesz got 49% of votes but got more than 2/3 of the seats
People are too close to each other, huh
**Buhahahhhaha**
Laughs evil-ly in german
You should make one with no white as well
I think that would be fun
Wait, San Marino and Andorra are not in the Schengen area
Pretty clear strategy
Good
boy
It's weird to call them brave, I'm pretty sure they had no idea where they were going and no choice in the matter
There are some more in Hungarian
"Ez nekem kínai
" - "This is Chinese to me
"Nem tudok héberül." - "I don't understand Hebrew
Or when someone says an English word sometimes the funny response is "Nem tudok németül/franciául
" - "I don't understand German/French
Weird
As a first language, Mandarin Chinese an Spanish are the two most spoken languages in the World (according to [Wikipedia]
^(edit: added link)
Even though Chinese is far more popular, we have another one too: Khoekhoe (Hottentotta)

Wooo, megacorporations wanted more profit and they got it wooo, what surprise

If you thought the vote was anything but a formality you are naive like a child
Time to invest in a good VPN it seems like
Gotta save the memes fast
People who voted yes have small penis
vote Orban as always :’((((((
Look at r/privacytoolsIO, there’s a sticky there
(I haven’t read it yet, though)
NordVPN seems to be good
Wow, the parties that voted against are the worst of the worst of politicians in Hungary
I'll have to research this and see if there's anybody acceptable
Supporting a federal Europe doesn't mean I want people there to shittalk about Hungary all day long until it comes to fruition
Disappointed with the ALDE
Gotta see who exactly voted for it
> But people don't understand because people are dumb and people are going to think "this other country voted against my interests".
It's not about that
I highly doubt that our government could push this through locally on their own, they've tried things like internet tax and protests have successfully made the government give up on the idea
But we can protest all we want, and in theory all our politicians could vote against it, this would still get through if the big players wanted it that way
I guess in that sense yes, the EU is to blame
Haha right yeah, assuming that elections aren't decided on sympathies and gut feelings of millions of people
Time to bust out the pan of hot water
Indeed not too many tales are left, but there are some
János Arany and his son László collected a lot of them similarly to the Grimm brothers
Wait, they dont put ketchup on the pizza
Sometimes i do
Hmmm what about some hot ketchup
Man, i wish, i want to fuck a demon since they appeared in superntural
Yeeey polak brother
At this point, i'd even fuck a demon who puts both pineapple and ketchup on pizza
and then i'd eat the pizza
i got hungry from this topic
Dude, they put cockroaches on the pizza
Home o' phobia

Go Serbia
Get those wannabe dictators out of office
Hopefully we will follow soon
Finaly, a protest that is reasonable
we can relate

Hungary in March: ~10 cases, we must close everything
Hungary now : ~1000 cases a day, noone really cares to close anything
Wonderful
But it actually was 4
yesterday
Hungary is ahead on that mate, we are only using this format
Which is why I actually think some population reduction is not a problem in Japan, provided it can stabilise later on (dunno, around 60-80m)
Sure, but in the really long term they would be better off
Right now Japan is overcrowded
Yes, the pensions will offset the economy for 1-2 generations, but after that they won't struggle with tons of problems
If they can stop the decline, and that's a big if
But it's not like a shrinking workforce won't affect Europe, we kinda lag behind Japan's trajectory by 25-30 years

Introverts are introverts even if they socialize LUL

...yeah its not like finns keep extreme distance from each other all the time, and that  this gets joked about a LOT
The only possible reason behind the post is that people want to deport foreigners to concentration camps for standing too close
After all everyone one is racist, and people are firing ub their crematoriums to dispose the corpses

Ezt a Magyar comment-et kerested
Ok, so what I've learned from this thread so far:
- Dutch roads are impeccable
- Belgian roads are crap
- Eastern European roads are even more crap
- Northern countries are in a constant cycle of paving the roads due to low temperatures
- French and Swiss roads are ok
Austrian-Hungarian border
*cries in Hungarian*
When coming home from Austria I can tell when I've crossed the border with my ass
The motorways are indeed well-maintained over here, however, once you go down to priority roads or smaller roads
ohh boy
The quality of the roads differs quite a lot through Hungary
For example in Hajdú-Bihar County the roads are quite good in my opinion, however, in Heves County they are terrible
Higways are usually decent
Avoid the public "toilet house" thingies in highway rest areas though, they are nightmare fuel
The toilets inside petrol stations are usually very clean
Draw the hungarian lofi girl please
I know its not an endorsement but i honestly feel she didn't deserve it
Makes me think of the Pauli Principle
isn't this normal tho
I mean if you have the space then why wouldn't you let some space to the other person
Of course if its already full I'm not gonna stand a street down, but If you have the space it's the norm I think
At least this is what I see in my country too 90% of the times
She might wants to test the healthcare system from inside
nah dont worry, it could be a lot worse
nice
Yay my country is as progressive as Switzerland /s
Huh weird I thought it's legal in Switzerland
That is really sad
I don't want to sound like a strictly conservative person ('cause I'm not) but I'm just curious about your opinions
Since marriage is an ancient catholic ritual between a man and a woman is it okay to let them practice marriage
Now wait
I'M NOT AGAINST GAY PEOPLE I KNOW GAY PPL AND I'M TOTALLY FINE WITH IT
But isn't it enough that they legally they are allowed to live together, buy property together, to adopt child etc
This kind of living together doesn't have to be named marriage
I mean the point of this is to be able to live together, raise child, buy property together etc
Or am I missing something
Well Hungary for example is a very progressive country
We are progressing from light blue to yellow
Thanks to our fellow ~~minister~~ dictator Orban
How is stolen bit worse than land of the free and the best place ever
In Hungary you can be married or you can get a paper saying you are living with someone in a relationship but it has a lot less legal stuff than marriage
For example can't take each others names, can't adopt children and can't have artificial insemination
How would you describe that darkness
Is it completely dark or is it like dawn or twilight with a very little light
How do you describe the time of the day
Do you use *afternoon, morning, evening,* etc
at all
I've been there
I was a kid though, when i was really into Assassin's Creed and i begged my parents for our next vacation to be here
Loved that trip
best AC game
Constantinople for lyfe
Meanwhile at Hungary, yesterday was the final 'hot' day (34C) now for a week gonna have 27-30 :)
still gonna be 28+ Celsius in my room even at midnight, living at the top of a 3 story building and no AC sucks
24° in East Hungary and there is wind
I missed this kind of weather for a long time
Same here but it was different when I went outside
*ground
Hungarian here, could you mail us some snow
It's literally 12-15°C here at the moment
So, literally like any online lobby today
typical greek-turkish interaction
This is a Chaddest and basedest thing i read today
*Get shanked Friday*
I think there is one more way to divide the english
>!yes or no to brexit XD
It's like 30°C in Hungary and I hate warm temperature
I love the North and cold
I laughed harder at this than needed
As hard as the joke justifies
Uh, like a chuckle I guess idk
Bismarck would be proud
Who even benefits from all this
Aside from the Russians of course
Well, even if she made the picture public herself, she still has rights, and it's better to offend some people than violating the rights of a single person

If you receive a Belgian wage but live in Belarus
I’d imagine that’s a huge boost to your lifestyle
The cost of living is a lot lower so you can buy more with the same amount of money, so I guess it’s an understandable decision

The american dream
Its Only 24c here today and I'm cold
I would gladly accept your 28c if you want to trade it
You know what is weird, Here in Budapest the new looking buildings around 2012 got destroyed and really old looking buildings got builded
There's a good chance that the common language would be Hungarian with all of this moving around
We have multiple Austria-Hungary, or what
Pass me the salt from Austria please
Where is this located
Imagine they would intruduce tarrifs (I now nobody can)
Are police officers banned from doing police stuff in other EU countries
Not to ruin the joke, but even back then, Austria-Hungary was much more like the EU instead of being a single country
Tiny nations, tiny tables
It's designed so that people eating there get into an argument over who uses their part of the table and start a war
"Country" /s
And then tell the Slovakians that their bench is actually a part of our bench
United we stand
Sooo, what would Austria contribute
From that pov, all of the table is actually Hungarian
Austro-Hungarian-Slovakian Monarchy for life
*sit
Didn't you know everything is Hungarian
Except Hungary before 1867
Holy shit
Womp womp bitch
Happy independence day neighbors
.... More land for us I guess
What
The
Actual
I think you could have gone with the current borders
They are the consequences of a few thousand years of conflicts between triggered nationalists or monarchs, still nobody is satisfied with them
So you just can't draw a map of Europe where a significant part of the population doesn't get offended
Hungary would’t even have Erdély
What kind of fuckery is this
Congratulation, you did
Oh my god
First thought was, before reading the caption "you son of a bitch".
So yeah, you succeeded
haha, ... ok
Schwitzerland is neutral too
I mean it worked that's for sure
Don't worry both sides are
Break Romania up, call Moldova Russia or Ukraine, rename Wallachia to Bulgaria, and Transylvania to Hungary or Trianon (just to trigger both sides)
Also break up Hungary completely, rename Slovakia to Upper Hungary
To be fair it's actually very good insult from a Hungarian standpoint
And funny as hell
Should have also separated Brittany and called it French Ireland or something
Also, why not rename France to Paris altogether
Yes but we have become the very thing we swore to destroy
Yeah he should have let the seashore to Romania and it would be perfect
But then I guess it would be too good for the Romanians
We have the high ground (they have the Alföld now)
Bruh we have the terrotory with the hungarian speakers
Hm, really
Do they really need to be bigger than this
> confusion of Romanians with Gypsies triggers us way more
Why
In the end, both are slavs
I assume they claim the rights of that particular recording, which might be correct
I wouldn't expect them to claim the rights of other recordings of the same piece

WEAR YOUR FUCKING MASKS THO
The balkan spring
Orbán is a wierd case, he tries to present himself as the "opposition" to the western EU states why complying with every German demand
He really is less dangerous then he presents himself
If only we had it too
Where is it
Us Hungarians are the only ones understanding the pain of everyone finding your language weird
Mi a faszt mondtál nekem, te kis kurva
Tudatnám veled hogy a legjobbak között végeztem a Magyar Honvédség osztályában, részt vettem számos titkos bevetésen az Al-Quaeda ellen, és több mint 300 halálos lövést adtam le
Kiképeztek gorilla hadviselésből, és én vagyok a legjobb mesterlövész az egész magyar fegyveres erőkben
Te nem vagy nekem semmi, csak egy újabb célpont
Olyan precizitással foglal kiirtani a gecibe amilyet még nem látott a Föld, jegyezd ezt meg
Azt gondolod megúszod hogy ilyen faszságokat mondtál nekem az Interneten
Gondold újra, seggfej
Miközben beszélünk, épp felveszem a kapcsolatot a Magyarországot lefedő kémhálózatommal akik pont most nyomozzák le az IP-címed úgyhogy készülj a viharra, te féreg
A viharra ami eltörli ezt a szánalmas dolgot amit te az életednek hívsz
Kibaszottul halott vagy gyerek
Bárhol lehetek, bármikor, és több mint hétszázféleképpen tudlak megölni, csak a puszta kezemmel
Nem csak fegyvertelen harcban vagyok kiképezve, hozzáférésem van a Terrorelhárítási Központ teljes arzenáljához, és ezt teljes mértékben használni is fogom hogy eltöröljem a szánalmas segged a kontinensről, te kis pöcs
Bár tudtad volna micsoda szentségtelen megtorlást szabadít rád az "okos" hozzászólásod, talán befogtad volna a kibaszott pofád. De nem tudtad, nem tetted, és most megfizeted az árát, te istenverte barom
Úgy telifoslak dühöngéssel, hogy bele fogsz fulladni
Kibaszottul halott vagy, öcskös.

FYI, Hungary's is actually "kill seven flies with one strike"
In hungary: Hetet egy csapásra

Still Budapest is the "best"
Same in Budapest
Luckily municipal elections are coming and there is a candidate advocating for this case

Reminds me to Midgar from Final Fantasy 7
In Hungary, we call these "landscape wounds", no building is allowed to be taller than our biggest temple in the capital
Yes, they are that stupid
I can see both of theirs, and its the same gif
[Here, I made an imgur mirror]
More jobs created
That's not how it works
Tariffs and paperwork are plentyful without the EU
All the EU does is add several more regulations that have to be checked that barely increase paperwork
With imports and exports this insane amount of paperwork is usually the norm
The shitshow we are seeing now isn't due to this being uncommon, it's due to a very short notice, unpreparedness and absolutely delusional expectations
EDIT: The EU has actually made it easier for member countries to import from or export to non-member countries, since goods transported through other member states require no additional administration for said transit
My city is on the front page of reddit
What a time to be alive
Bojler eladó!
Why is everyone talking about the Germans
I went to r/de and found the post but don't actually speak German
Could someone enlighten me
Budapest is usually used for Moscow, or some other Russian city, or occasionally WW2 Germany in Hollywood movies
In the Marvel universe it is even portrayed as a very Russian area but straight up called Budapest
Also there is futuristic looking mall in Budapest (Bálna) which is usually a Mars base or Nasa HQ in movies
So the EU is siding with China and India against the US and Brazil
Reading the comments I feel like I learn more fun facts about your country than I ever could from Wikipedia
It's so much fun to see how the little details that a foreigner eye would just skip are recognized and elaborated on by your countrymen
I just searched for the Romanian one and it's true for that version as well
Both are amazing artworks and it is an awesome initiative
Great work
I would love to see a Hungarian version of this at some point
Sad
Budapest was destroyed too
Old Köln kinda looks like some parts of Budapest
I hate thoose ugly socialist buildings
Did the commies really think that those are nice
Well it looks like it's not eastern vs western EU, but northern vs southern EU
Poland won, Greece lost
Fake
Hungary unemployment statistics is fake
For example: if you work a day in a year, you aren't unemployed in that year's statistics
Hungarian government lies as Greeks earlier
> All you have to do is pick the fruit, that's all
Yep
That's the problem
Not necessarily in Poland - i am not well informed on live able wages to make a call - but in many places its not viable
Apple is VERY cheap, at least compared to the amount of work needed to pick it in time before it rots
So most places rely on mechanization or part time workers to solve the issue
And at least here in Hungary we pretty much must use some pesticides to produce apple that can be sold, as most folks don't eat apple that contains maggots
>golden age of monarchies is so old even the flags are outdated
Wdym, Austria-Hungary still existed 101 years ago
Meh
My point was that the difference in flags doesn't indicate such a huge timespan
Hungarian media looks exatcly the same; we are continously under attack by Brussels, EU, Soros
Newly reformed public channel, M1 has a budget of 23 million euros and has become a non-stop propaganda channel
One of the two largest commercial channels, TV2, was bought by a Fidesz friendly oligarch and had the same fate
Utterly shameless
Same in Hungary, just throw in some anti-Soros, anti-charity, pro-religion stuff and some made up numbers how Hungary is the best economy in Europe atm
I mean, yeah, it's sad but pls, this is low level apprentice stage compared to what's going on in Hungary
Just one of the continously running anti-brussels ads:
For that very reason I don't watch TV in Hungary
Well, to be fair, the reason is that it's utter and complete garbage anyway, with or without the propaganda and I don't care for it
But I sure don't miss it
There isn't really a source that isn't biased
I'm usually reading online news, and all the sites are beginning to look like /pol, just throwing shit at each other
It's really shameful
Also 7th article will not happen because our government will back you up
This government always needs somebody/something to fight against to validate their actions
They had a "lucky run" in this respect with the migration crisis, but it started wearing thin last year, so out of the blue came Soros and the whole thing gets weirder each day
I don't follow politics that much and I know almost nothing about politics in general, but here's my theory which I find the most logical
Our government wants to stay popular with these "hatred campaigns". "You should hate and fear the migrants and now Soros
" If a topic wears out they find some other scapegoat
The main target group of this propaganda is the less educated people, they will believe it with no hesitation
This way the government/Fidesz convinces these people that they are protecting our country with all their strength (from something that isn't a real danger at the first place)
Thus the easily manipulated people have a higher chance to become supporters of the party
Pretty much what /u/vernazza said
RTL Klub was the first channel Fidesz tried to aquire, but was rebuffed and went for it's competitor instead
TV2 was mainly a tabloid channel, reality TV, celebs and such, never or rarely political
Even since the takeover, it became one of the most rabid pro-government channels, and many people who were there since it's founding in the late 90' left because of it
Some further reading if you are interested:
Here in Hungary we have the same, sadly
If anyone criticises the government, they're called an agent of Soros or someone who sold the country
My family is a very (and i mean VERY) big Fidesz-fan, and if I say anything against the government I'm instantly someone blinded by liberal lies etc
We had a far right "life and justice party" a few years ago
Now it's defunct
Rossman
Great, vendors will have a chance to water up hygiene products like pubs do with drinks
yaay,Im not the last
What's up with Malta tho
No surprise here :\\ Orbán keeps winning by making the less strong-minded brainwashed by an intense 10-year-old media campaign
So he will do it as long as it works, and it works ...
Why am I not surprised
Hey, as someone who lives in the country that invented Soros being an evil mastermind, I feel you
Also I am afraid that we will join Bulgaria soon
Does the government spend hundreds of millions for propaganda just to tell everyone in every possible media outlet (where they own wast majority it) that the opposition is shit
A journalist was apparently killed by the government and other journalists say they're fearing their safety
How is this country above Hungary
What a dumbass list
What are these values based on anyway
Yeah, rags like "the sun" are what journalism
Journalism is basically state sanctioned propaganda at this point, or close to it
If you need a license to be a journalist, its not very different from China (yes, thats how it works there)
But really, I've never seen us so high on a positive list before
That’s because we’re in the EU, im guessing
Certainly not because of our Minister for Foreign Affairs… I bet you on that
same, and honestly, it makes me quite happy
...for now
Mészáros bought Digi :(
We are
*Roblox oof sound*
Pls no
And a new kind of torture begun
That's my home town
:"D
This is the underpass in Szolnok between city central and the Szécheny residential district
Mind you the town lies on the Great Plains, the only reason there's an underpass there is because of a train track
However the drain system is outdated (non-existent) so whenever there's a huge rainfall (which is more frequent due to global warming, Saharan warm dust meets cold arctic/alpine air from north/west), the underpass floods
whoa
where in Hungary was this
Visit Venice
Before Venice visits you

Singapore is a unique case, they are a city that is kind of a trading and financial gateway to East-Asia
Singapore in Europe would be the Netherlands these days
To be honest, I think the brexit is not bad for the EU
I actually pretty like it
A lot of times in the EU certain good legislations (1989-Social Charta, Joint Eropean Forces act [I donno the original name of that legislation], the first common ID law[EEU]) didn't come into act, because the UK refused to sign it, while every other nation did
And what I read all around the news from UK is: "... UK marginalised in the EU", and also the thing that mostly annoys me is that mentality that EU should give all benefits to the UK withouth following any EU regulations
Do they learn their ideas from Sovereign Citizen tutorial videos from youtube or what
The most dutch thin i ever seen in this sub was the proposal, that "well sea levels are rising, we must act
Let's reclaim doggerland
There is only one explanation, the kids get orphaned more often then elsewhere
Same in Hungary
Because our great landlords don't allow us to register their property as our permanent address
Sometimes they let tenants register temporary address, but that means nothing actually, your official address is still your permanent one
Well if there is no stigma, and they have a good relationship, why wouldn't they
...well the UK will join the europen but not really club, so you don't have to feel left out
at least you have a cooperation like this
in Hungary protests (of 300 ppl) only last 'til the weather turns shit
you go neighbours
maybe us hungarians will get inspired too
Looking at this pic its not more than 5 thousan people, they are hilarious if they think its a coup in the making
Same politicians don't really care even when its in the 50 thousands
rofl
Finally some coast for Hungary
I am sad that we are so far from everyone, but at least we've got the geysers
:D Hot shrimps incoming
As a Hungarian I approve this plan
Hungary was meant to be an island all along
At least Hungary got a sea back
You lose some you win some
Austria taking us over and us being relocated to a freezing hell (although beautiful) is quite unnerving to say the least
No more border disputes, lol
Yes, put Hungary to a remote island
Well done, couldn't agree more
I could live with that
(Hungary)
I'll take Iceland it's a very beautiful country
As a Hungarian, I approve of moving to Mosslandia
I think I have seen this one in the past
Help its freezing out here
NEVER
I want my great plains back
Thanks in advance Austria for keeping our country safe for old times' sake
Enjoy our hot springs, we've got new ones now
Also: no more neighbors stealing our land due to no neighbors
Hungary
I stil have my residence permit
Na végre tengerpart
I don't mind the lack of neighbors harder for other countries to invade
Also no more border questions/conflicts
Ngl I'd love that
Especially beautiful Iceland
Trianon safe borders
Seems like a good tradeoff for the shrimps and the coasts tbh
And also, I would imagine our country as a middle finger instead of a thumb
Rákpaprikásh, paprikáshtinthahalal
Hungary used to be bigger
Slovakia, Croatia and Transylvania (big chunk of Romania) was a part of the "historical" Hungary
We lost it in WW1
The treaty "celebrated" its 100 th birthday a few days ago
100 éve and we're still talking about it
Probably 1000
And their children spoke Croatian
God-Empress of Germankind
Rest in peace
Guys, who the fuck invited Moon Moon
that looks like a bear
According to this, not only Budapest but the entire Pest county is considered developed
It's somethin' man
how the fuck did Budapest and Pest county make it into the more developed regions category
It's baffling how not even West and Central Transdanubia are transitional regions
Aside form Central Hungary, those are the most developed regions of the country
Hungarians, is it just me, or is it sad how all of hungary is less developed except for Pest megye
In EasternEurope, u either bad or good, there is no middle
Map is definitely missing Savaria (now Szombathely)
Budapest (the lonely dot around the middle of Hungary) was built next to a pre-existing celtic village too
And Hungarianness
Everybody's waiting for their country I think but boy this is gorgeous
My maternal grandparents both fled Hungary in the 60’s to escape Soviet rule
My grandfather swam across the Adriatic to get away from the bloc
I can’t imagine what living under those times must’ve been like
These are our heroes
Glory to the heroes
Also I would like to take the opportunity to say thanks to all the nations who accepted the people who fled the country once the revolution was lost
About 200000 people were welcomed by western nations
I’m a proud to be Hungarian
The soviets would soon fall
Wrong Russian flag - and date - in 1849 :-)
I don't. The museum is run by one of Orbán's most outspoken supporters who uses every platform she has to spread hate speech and propaganda
If you disagree with our current government's policies, please don't contribute a cent to it by visiting this museum
There are other ways to learn about Hungary's history
I believe it's free admission today
There wasn't enough time to outline any political plans besides that the Red Army should leave and Stalinists should be ousted from power
Those - mostly local - leaders who organized or even proposed anything resembling political institutions - eg
local elections, assemblies - were given special attention during the following retributions
Nagy was a reform communist, and he freed former political prisoner social democrats who joined the new government
But on the ground level the movement was very varied ideologically, including even royalists
people were fighting for simple democracy and freedom
Putting labels like that is obviously wrong given that socialism fucked our country just as much nazism did
Hungarian neutrality along the lines of Austria and Finland, obviously
probably nothing
The communist party received 17% in the 1945 elections and 22% (despite cheating and changing the electoral law) in '47
The majority of people were anti-communist
> Some of my friends who came here then as children today share my sadness how Hungary today deals with refugees
And how many of those refugees (or their children) bombed concerts, rammed trucks in crowds or attacked HQs of newspapers in the name of Communism (or a religion)
Hungarians were/are also perfectly fine with refugees arriving from the former Yugoslavia or Ukraine
They fit in and didn't cross multiple safe countries on their way which they didn't like because of economic reasons
Nope, the arrow cross party was first to repurpose the building
Speaking about the electorate, nobody has a "crush on Russia" in Hungary
Those who repeatedly voting Fidesz to majority (rural, small-town and not-highly educated people) are mostly comsuming the state-controlled-media which barely or not at all speaks about the government Russia-friendly actions
They -the Fidesz- know it's not a topic what they can win over voters with
You can learn about it in the non-government media tho, but since people who consuming these are already mostly opposition voters it can't help much
Not sure
He wrote a book in Hungarian but my Hungarian isn’t quite good enough to read something like that
The Russian intervention was a response to the dethronement of the Habsburgs, in 1849
Therefore, Russiaball's response shall be dated accordingly, as the comic is misleading in the current state (and I'm nitpicking)
And, according to [Wikipedia] the simple tricolor was the merchant flag of Russia at the time
That's not something under which land armies march, I assume
(The Tsarist flag had the eagle superimposed and the various army regiments had [their] [own] regimental regalia
She likes to skew - or outright falsify - facts here and there, but if you don't understand the accompanying texts, you're generally safe
Both the building and the exhibition can be interesting for foreigners as an introduction
(Although the locally-known Dózsa László debacle was just a disgusting shitshow on their part
I get it, it *is* a well-known institution after all
:) Just something to keep in mind
What’s the title
I’d love to check it out, sounds interesting
What plans
Those flew out of the window after armed conflict broke out
(The optimal resolution would be the Soviets leaving and Hungary obtaining neutrality, followed by elections
There's no telling how they would have gone, but post-war elections in [1945] and [1947] resulted in the majority of popular votes for the smallholder's / non-communist parties
Countryside revolutionary leaders rarely had close ties to the Party either
Looking the other way on technology *transfers*, for example
A huge empire cannot be allowed to fall suddenly, too many things could go horribly wrong
yeah well it still claimed about 250,000 lives and irrepearable damages to the economy, so I dont see nothing wrong calling each regimes equally as awful
*forgot to mention when the Red Army raped their way through Hungary, which also adds up to the death toll
*Obviously
* (The USSR leaving Austria in exchange for its neutrality was a recent development then
) What-ifs are free
The state secret police (already under communist influence) set up shop there in 1945 already, if the Hungarian wiki is to be trusted
Interesting, the city was barely functional then
However, it became so infamous that it was repurposed after the revolution
IIRC the brutal retribution caused various Western communist parties to split and slowly sink into obscurity or to become outright irrelevant (and seen for what they were: Soviet puppets)
Supporting the USSR's great experiment just wasn't as chic as it used to be
Well holy shit I thought he used some small boat or something but no, literally swam with nothing, then somehow got successful in New York, that’s impressive
> ultimately led to improving workers and farmers lives
If you're willing to disregard those workers and farmers whose lives were destroyed (often literally) as a consequence, then yeah, obviously
Don't pay much attention to alcoholism and suicide skyrocketing during progress either, that's just a side effect of lives being improved
Couldn't handle the speed
Yeah I really wish I could read it but sadly I suck at reading Hungarian
Most of my skill is just conversational
It's time to visit an opthalmologist, then :-)
Free societies don't have press gangs roaming the countryside, forcibly convincing smallholders to join the nearest collective farm
Nor do they have labour and internment camps
> there were no internment camps in the US in the 1940s for Japanese people
Wartime is, *by definition*, an exceptional state
A lot goes during wartime that's unthinkable during peacetime, including shooting people, bombing people, stabbing people, clubbing people etc
> nowadays at the US/Mexico border or at the EU-borders
Those aren't *internment* camps
(A state can only inter its own citizens
> Also there are no forced sells/people withdrawn from their lands like in Latin America and Asia
'Forced sell'. That's a modicum better than 'forced' w/o sale
Does the state directly organize and allow those
Let me educate you a little bit on how socialist Hungary dealt with the problem of people not wishing to join the state-run collective farms that were clearly in the best interest of the affected
Gang of state-employed activists showed up at homes and demanded the proprietor to join
Refuses
Local police/council shows up, takes the proprietor to an interrogation
Beats him up, because that's how you convince people to part with their property - if he dies, he dies
After a few days, he's let go, because that'll send a message to the entire community
Rinse and repeat until he joins
Here comes the best part - under socialist law, one member of a household 'joining' the collective farm applied to every other member, too
(I'll leave you to guess the price of the property
&#x200B;
Edit: if your translation engine is *the* cutting edge of today's socialist technology, then nothing has changed :-)
I wonder why the danes don't push for the coronabonds :D They are strict fiscally and they don't give in to corporate interests
Hungarian Army IRL
I think Trump was right to let the left and blacks riot during the pandemic, it will help the republican demography
It's kinda familiar for me
It's the same situation in Hungary
Atleast you have debates, our shit president doesn't even bother doing any kind of interviews or debates
If he wants to have more votes at the election he can just import voters from Ukraine(who can vote for some reason) or he can just give a bag of potato and a glass of pálinka to the poor people to buy their votes
Could someone give me a youtube link for this, please
Welp, at least they practice social distanting
Almost same shit in hungary
It is the same
Trust me, majority of us hate this system very deeply, but we cannot do anything against it
Trump even complimented Orban when he was using hate policies
And now Orban made Hungary a dictatorship until he doesn't want it to be anymore, it's a f*cking joke how people still try to defend him
Dithering
Hello
As someone from Hungary, good luck
Fidesz hasn't touched abortion laws here yet, but  public healthcare and the independence of universities are on the chopping block rn
Croatian tourism in shambles
Was it warmer, because there were more lower altitute places
Impossible
Actually my geography teacher told about this when we were learning about the economic geography of the post-Yugoslav countries
ITT ppl saying immigration is good and some ppl dying cause of those is "fine"
As unbelievable as it sounds, most people do not understand satire, and will think this is an insult to them
As a Hungarian I fully approve many more Hungarians need to learn of tolerance and respect for each other
(Edit spelling error) :)
Update: The flag has already been teared down by radical football fanatics
To be fair not a big suprise
I live in Hungary, and i haven't heard of this yet
Thanks for letting me know, this makes me so happy :D
Hmm, no
Budapest is just like any other capital city, it belongs to the tourists and office workers
There is hardly any reason to visit down town for those who live in the outer districts, and it is also getting harder and harder because of the closed streets and bus/cycle lanes
Our country is being ruined by the agents of caos
chaos* english is not my native language sorry
It's commendable, but also a pretty good way to lose the next elections
bruh
some football ultras tore it down and burned it tonight
Nah, he is already hated by gov media
Lmao you couldn’t be more wrong
Black people get spit on, if you are gay most people will hate you no matter who you are
Hungarians are really ignorant
Most people above the age of 45 are voters of the political party called Fidesz
They a literally robbing the whole country and the general society thinks it is okay to do so
Majority of young people who study at a university wants to leave this shithole, as it seems like we cannot change anything
Orbán doesn't care, if his rular voters would be oro-LMTQ so would he
Who's furious are the "journalists" of his party, who actually belive the shit they write about
We accept Italians too <3
To be fair, the problem isn't in Budapest or the major cities
It's in Mucsaröcsöge where they haven't moved out of the socielist mindset
hungARYAN
And
The Civil union already has the same benefits as marriage
Instead of focusing on contriversal and empty things like that we could focus on discrimination of homosexuals in adoptation procedure
One of the opposition party called Momentum did a solidarity protest for the people of Belarus during August 11
I AM CHAOS
I AM DEATH
I AM
GAY
I am a gay living in a small village in Borsod county (which some consider as the most underdeveloped and backward region of Hungary)
I came out to my family and close friends years ago, but nobody hates me because of my sexual orientation
And they are far from being liberal
I can live a relatively normal life
The only annoying thing is the usage of "buzi" as a general swear word in every third sentence
Also, our university towns, like Debrecen, Szeged or Pécs are full of Black people
I know some of them, and they are perfectly fine
They only know about minor isolated cases, e.g. when pensioners thougth that they are migrants and similar sad things, but that's all
So what are you talking about
You are generalizing the same way as our fellow countryman do it with minorities, except you are doing it with Hungarians
I'm not gonna pretend racism and homophobia don't exist, but get real with their generalizations man
Lived here for 6 years, I personally saw two cases of black people being fucked with, and homophobia exists too of course, mostly right wing/older people from what I've seen
And it's not like I don't have any friends who are gay or black
They don't paint a terrible picture with their personal experiences, either
Sure, they have had hardships, but it's not like they hate living here because of those reasons
The leaving part, eh yeah
lot of people around my age (25) want to leave, but have family, friends, opportunities, hope, etc
University students were majority Jobbik voters when they were the old self far right party
umm hello
based department
It isn’t really
It’s the state of the country that scares us
For example our life expectancy is lower than the retirenent age for males
Our education system instead of improving just gets eorse and worse over the years
Both higher education and lower education
Seeing football stadiums built up from nothing even though we suck at it, then walking into a hospital that looks awful
Waiting for countless months even years for a surgery is regular
There is a guy who used to be the Hungary-Peru ambassador got busted for having over 19k child porn on his cumputer then got a 1500€ fine
These are some of the reasons Hungary is fucked, but we could go on and on with listing things but we couldn’t finish it today
For better salary nothing more
there's many reasons for that but same-sex rights isn't one of them
I could be shot for treason for agreeing with a Romanian, but you are goddamn right lol
Depends, in Budapest
Definitely not, even Fidesz voters are Okey with him since he didn't do things that would go against their values
Outside Budapest
Yeah very much, in many places people only consume pro-government media (think of it as people who only watch BBC if BBC was blatantly for low-class and radically pro-Torry)
I advise you to look at the Index (online media) article posted in their facebook
Just look at it
I live in borsod as well, my cousin came out as a bisexual and his family is not far from completely disowning him
They banned him from coming to family gatherings
I think you are just in a lucky situation
As for the student cities, of course people going to be more tolerant as time goes on but they still get discriminated
I’m glad for your situation right now tho
I mean on the countryside 100%. As of the other “big” cities is also mostly yes
I never really lived in BP but its not as full of really conservative old people
I would disagree
Since civil union is marriage in everything but name mosst off the people accepted it as a thing already
Many just doesn't want to give up the idea of "sacred marriage" out of religious belief
The adoptation issue is mostly due to being managed by Christian democrats from Fidesz's coalition party KDNP which is filled with the worst kind of people in the country (like the minister who thinks 10 commandments heal better then the Healthcare system while being a doctor)
Orbán isn't genuinely anything, he has no values outside love for power
Goes as the wind blows, says whatever brings more votes
Fidesz voters are okey with him, because the party isnt pertfect
Sadly, every other party has problems too, mostly the MSzP, because of the öszödi beszéd. The only problem with Karácsony, that he isnt that sharp minded
But he tries to be a good guy, and there is a really a few politicans who tries itq
Yeah that flag just got teared down as well
I think he also genuinely likes money
Ain't certain though, he only surely stole couple billions yet
Boldog Cake napot
Basically, wanted to stay with a European example since American politics are very distinct
I mean, some Torry biass and "If you don't vote Torry you aren't British and want migrants to eat us" is two very different things
But most of it was spent on keeping him in power
Constant campaigns in every media consume a lot of money
Köszi
Same in hungary
In Hungary we would go from house to house and spray parfume on each girl and woman and in return they give the boys and men decorated eggs, chocolate (eggs) and a bit of money
In the past we would also pour a bucket of water on them
Now that this whole virus is going on, this wont be celebrated at all
Poland just wanted yearly wet t-shirt contests
In Hungary at least Aprils used to be quite hot already so at least here it isn't an issue
I like how every other nations brings water usually and we bring parfumes
I feel like someone mistranslated something in the past /s
We still have a local railway station named Aquincum there in Budapest
I wonder what are the numbers of total similar situations
This is what you call integrity
He finally realised that he shouldn't be serving dictators

what is his rank
just a simple policeman
thanks btw
yeah he is just a random officer just above street thug level, "police captain" implies a lot more important rank
>death threats
This is when I would have taunted them "come and get me then", as if they could
Death threats are the worst arguments and they are the ones that say "I am weak af in real life"
Well played
Jeez, this is unbelievable even by Hungarian standards
I had to visit a couple of hospitals lately because of my father and some are shitty, but this is a whole new level
Our hospitals are hopelessly understaffed and our entire healthcare could collapse any time but
wow ... I can't even
Umm what
I know we don’t have the best but its not as nearly as bad as that
Source: been in one of the dumpier hospitals a while ago and it was better than that
Seriously
I spent two weeks around Bucharest, Covasna, castle Braun and not a single freeway
I kept hearing it’s because of corruption
We have 15% and 27% VAT
Im not so sure about the first one
EDIT: looks like the eastern Swedish  people arent happy today
Muhahahhaaa downvote me all ya want im not going anywhere hahaha
How do you pronounce that thing
It's like one of my movies

Finally we're first in something
Finally something that Hungary is best in in Europe
Yet it's fucking hard to find porn where they talk hungarian
Umm, mi van Magyarországgal
I'm not surprised that we have the most whores in the EU but I always seen more czech ones
Imagine how much more Hungary could have if we got back transylvania  /s
Just Prague and Budapest became the hub for the porn industry thats what  makes all the differences

Alright, we shouldn’t act as if the BLM protests wouldn’t have anything to do with the daily cases being up in the US (I mostly support peaceful protests because I think it is a basic human right to protest, but now is absolutely the worst possible time to do it, and in some cases it turned from peaceful to outright barbaric, what I despise)
If i can quote some swedish fellas "The Winner takes it all"

Happy cake day for you too
The Hero we need, but not deserve
The last 3 surprised me, how can you have such big balls to claim entire countries
Yes, but South and North Korea are kinda understandable, since they are technically still at war, and even in the case of Taiwan, it was once párt of China, unlike the entirety of Kazakhstan
Good on ya neightbour
Maybe once you finally pass us we can start upping our game as well
We also have great GDP growth, sadly, only in our own currency
Some would say it's just inflation, but those are bad people
Somewhat related: I remember when the Hungarian govermant was battling with Google maps whether it should let them scan us for StreetView or not, while some romanian company (Norc
) just came in, scanned us and got the fuck out, I remember using them before StreetView :D
I like that this isn't like a big art stunt
This has meaning and thought to it
If you look closely the first two and the second two collums are both in alphabetical arrangement, so I suppose it has all of the names who died from the village in the WW1 and WW2
Not an uncommon name, Gulyás in Hungarian means a person who took care of cattle, as in the occupation, not just the food gulyás, which comes from that term
According to the Hungarian site another user linked it was erected in 2014
So your suspicions were right
Horvát/Horváth is one of the most common family names in Hungary
Its the Hungarian equivalent of Smith or Jones
Russians: u sure
The chance of me committing hate crimes with my car is a bit smaller tho
Pedig szép.
This city made me understand what acrophobia feels like
Ironic how "ronda" means ugly in Hungarian
ígazán Ronda
Sorry, I misspelled acrophobia
But yeah, sometimes looking up to tall buildings makes me dizzy too
(texas drawl) THat's we're growing our foootballs, but the wind brought in summat from Mexico so now they'll all roundish(/texas drawl)
Some good starting advice would be to gain more than 7% of the country's support when protesting
Ah, so this is funded by the Open Society Foundation
Got it, same thing that happened here

oh we do that in Hungary too, lots of hungarization of foreign names

...yes
Money in taxes is always - at least partially - going to end up in corrupt politician's pockets
Only difference is that you wont hear news about it, if it happens in the west
Berlins Brandenburg airport still not being finished after 2011 start of the project
With multiple cost overruns dodgy worksmanship, and delays
Before COVID start the building was declared completed, only to be found to be a complete fire hazard, not only missing sensors, but not complying with fire code on other points - for a start, and thats not all of the issues
Or how Merkels party managed to not phase out coal plants, instead fire moreup, to make sure germany isnt carbon neutral, despite its growing renewable energy sector
Making news about corrupt, immoral, shitty, europoor east is the perfect way for your local representative to point your attention away from his/her own scandals
(Similarly to how Soros conspiracy theorists are the same thing for Orban)
Yeah corruption doesnt exist in Germany
...the overruns, late finish, half assed jobs on Berlin's Brandenburg airport were clearly not due to theft & corruption
Its due to Chinese cyber warfare
Allow me to be a bit sceptical
When a project thats plagued with cost overruns, shoddy worksmanship, and the like is opened during the middle of COVID, when none cares
It like that Lilum E-jet that "mysteriously" caught fire during COVID when news had no time to report on their scam - after being unable to deliver the impossible prodcut they promised
There is a saying that 1st case is incompetence, second is sabotage, 3rd is enemy action
That airport edges very close to the enemy action territory
Which makes the "its incompoetence, noone is corrupt here" a bit hard to believe
[Orbán - How to cook Easter ham]
Hand drier too
Fancy
I wouldn't be shocked if Hungary recognize it in some form
Orbán is mad enough to do it, and we have our own fight for autonomy in Romania
Now it's only a matter of ti
aaaand Germany is fascist again
This picture makes me uncomfortable
huh, so hungarian is the only language with Ő and Ű, interesting never knew that
German does have ö. Just because it says: ä --yes--> ö --yes--> eesti keel ö --no--> ß --yes--> German
We have á too
If it looks like fish speak, its romanian, thats how I recognize it
You can kinda see the old coastline based on roads and landmark positions on the current one

I often hear the argument that: we shouldn't take these statues down because they are part of history
I hate to come with this example but
Hitler was a part of history
Would you like to see statues of him as well
We should build statues of figures of examples, not just any historical figure that had a big impact
There's many other ways to remember and learn about those
As a hungarian: is it possible to learn this ability

Everyone from hungary : Perhaps, peac is an option
99 years have passed, Ukraine is still occupying territory in Hungary
No, they wouldn't stop selling their stuff in the Netherlands, they have a lootboxless version of their games for Belgium, so they can just make that available there
I see you have texture issues, hoping the hotfix drops soon
this guy taxes
Same would go for Hungarian too (more or less)
Looking at the other replies, maybe it is the anglophones who are strange and never say what they mean
Not a dutch, but for hungarians this is all true
In my opinion genders are an outdated concepts in languages, as there are subtle differences in male vs
female denotation in German and French for example
And if you are getting proficient in both languages you have to keep all of this in mind
(And it is especially hard for you if neither of them is a mother tongue for you and you are translating between them
) I know that the genders can be traced back to Ancient Greek (and now thats a hard language with all those kind of tenses and genders
) but often I find them obsolete with all those exceptions anyway
(And we don't even get into the modern transgenderism problems here
Finnish/Uralic languages even have a kind different concept of tenses (at least speaking of Hungarian, but I might be ask a Finnish friend) and they are usually more descriptive versus the indo-european languages (where subtle denotations are made by the genders for example)
And I assume you make mistakes from time to time, after a decade of speaking that language
I do
The guy on the left looks like he's about to burst out in laughter lol

Sorry, I'm 6 hours late, is it still URGENT
So what happens if CSTO is invoked
Would NATO do anything
> Would NATO do anything
Tbh NATO seems to only exist in name these days
I don't think they'll ever do anything big in the future other than disband
Clearly nobody wans to get involved in distant conflicts with no benefits to them
*ne*
What I meant was, unless it's an actual Russian invasion of a memberstate I don't think NATO would ever fulfill any serious obligation in the future
And it'll certainly stay out of anything to do with Turkey
To me it seems like the interests of member states and the threats they face have changed a lot since the organization was founded, and most members are far from fully commited now
Which is why I'm not sure if the organization has a future
It's become too fragmented and afraid of a real fight
yea it was not, that's why actual socialists rebelled against the soviets and led uprisings throughout the eastern bloc in these years
well yea, soviets went after actual communists in these years so it shouldn't be too controversial to say they were not real communists
You're spreading western propaganda, the Soviets were actually delivering free stuff to help the people
What are you saying here
Was the Rogue Khmer "real communism" or not according to you
They were publicly supported by the US and a good part of western commies did not support them at all
Maybe some western socialists are supporting China now, but they're idiots too and are not real communists either
What's going on in China is literally capitalism on steroids
Communism has a meaning that should be clear to anyone who has ever read any Marx
It's not a system of government, but a workers movement to topple capitalist conditions
It's protesters / strikers / revolutionaries who are communists, not governments
So your objection is that *some* western people supported the Khmers (while most did not or just ignored them) who later recalled their position when it was apparent that it's retarded and it turned out that the Khmers have nothing to do with communism
It looks like your problem is not with communism, but with some people who call themselves communists
That concern I share too
Communism has an invariant meaning since at least the middle of the 19th century
You can only meaningfully criticize it, if you know what it means
>After all, Pol Pot was educated in Europe by said "real communists" and returned to Cambodia to fulfill the "real communism".
Well, he was an idiot too: "Sâr (Pol Pot) found many of Karl Marx's denser texts difficult, later saying he "didn't really understand" them
" lmao
I am a Marxist, not a tankie and I am not Western from the POV you're talking about
Even if there would've been a large majority of Khmer supporter "commies" on the west (I'd love to see some reliable source on that), how would that change the fact that the Khmers actions did not align with communism
Do you agree, that your problem is not with communism, but with alleged communists from the West in the 70's?
So much nicer than Budapest Metro line 4, this is what it should look like when all the money is spent well

Slovakia still doesn't exist

In my opinion it must be mostly nationalists who oppose EU’s immigrant policy
Among other things you cannot leave offthe bottom, to make diffrences bigge, or zoom out to make differences look smaller
Charts like the one above are much better for propaganda
So, do we get back Transylvania or nah
What I see in the middle is the German Empire and the Monarchy
As a Hungarian, us being regarded as central as opposed to eastern feels so nice for some reason
I like how they just went with "Southeastern Europe" when everyone knows they meant "The Balkans"
Also the border between Central and Western Europe should be drawn straight through Belgium
Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania
All four of those are Eastern European countries
yup, in almost every major city in Hungary the main squares are pretty much the same
Celebrating Ursula von der Leyen no doubt
Wouldn't it be funto see Brexit coming to mean UK leaving EU, then Ireland reunites, Scotland, Wales, and the Citystate of London leave Britain, and rejoin the EU
Then the Brexit would happen in totality both from EU and the United Kingdom

I was once involved in a conversation:
Him: "So where are you from
Me: "Hungary"
Him (with a bit of pause and slightly trolling face): So you're
You're hungry most of the time
Me (pretending to be thinking and amused): Wow, that's interesting
Never thought about that before
Him (actually surprised): Really
Me - *trollface
There's (almost, don't take my words literally) nothing worse than attempting a laugh and not going absolute dogshit after the Hungary joke
It's like the first thing EVERYONE says after you tell them that you're from Hungary
And they even fucking think that it's legitimately funny
EDIT: And there is that half - two seconds (depending on overall sense of humor, usually none) between the realisation that I come from Hungary and the "joke". That is the time period in which we can prepare for the oncoming "joke".

Sending my warmest regards to our Finn cousins as a Hungarian
We are thought about the Kalevala in primary school and up until the recent rage in politics it's been thought that our languages are related to each other, although got separate from the common ancestor(s) like 5000 years ago
To me and to many, many other Hungarian Finnish sounds like our language from a distance and that similarity is thrilling
I find Finnish sounding very endearing, playful and always make me smile when I hear it on very rare occasions
God bless the Finns
[Best language tree I've ever seen]

Unlike almost all other European languages, we don't belong in the Indo-European language family, sharing the Finno-Ugric family with the Finns, the Estonians and some extremely small Uralic languages

If state report, then note that in many countries even Christians identify themselves officially as non-christians, otherwise they're forced to pay additional church taxes (no matter if they're practicing, if they belong to some other community etc)
Just a nice rhetoric, most of the people I know (even older ones) don't attend churches and couldn't care/know less about Christian stuff
I've seen more interest towards spiritual (like meditation techniques) directions in my circle than Christianity
That is not representative ofc, since I mostly interact with highly-educated urbanites

"Kurva" is not bad for Hungary, but I would rather nominate "bazmeg" and its affiliates
What about Russia
Why are they left out
The only thing this map was supposed to do, it failed at
In hungarian kurva is not common
Baszd meg
(\~fuck it) is common
However its also not the most harsh of our cursing, not by a long shot
We have things along the lines of:
*  "A kurva isten verje bele a rákos faszát!" = "The bitch/prostitute god should beat his cancerous dick into this (thing/situation)
* Basznád teherbe a jó kurva anyádat
" = "Fuck your well used prostitute mother pregnant
* "Vitt volna el a rézfaszú bagoly
" = "You should have been taken by the owl with the copper dick
" - owl refers to medical doctor, and the copper dick refers to abortion instruments, the whole thing is an archaic way of saying your mother should have aborted you
Those are just the classic ones, you can find more at r/szopjatokle (=r/suckmeoff)
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
Including gems like:
* "Elon Musk wants to implant chips into peoples brains
He should impkant his dick into his mother
* Your brother in law alex tells that your pussy should rot and fall out of your body
* If i had 5 pussies, even then i woildnt let you into one if them
* All the dogs who suck Orban's dick should fall dead one by one
you shoudl lick his pussy until suffocate in his shit, you dogs
ALL of you, you retarded sellout jizz
...i am sure you all have pedophile leanings, beat my dick into it
Kurva is just the tip of the Hungarian swearing iceberg
In hungary you wouldn't say kurva as an exclamation, it would be more like basszameg/baszki/bazmeg/etc
Those are almost all different words, "fuck" for England but "whore" for Hungary
I'd argue that in Hungary "baszd meg" is more important
Potentially the easiest 15K karma OP collected in 12 hrs
“A kurva életbe” works, too, but never “kurva” in itself
If we want to use kurva, there's also "A KURVA ANYÁDAT" (yes, all caps is mandatory) which roughly translates to "your whore mother".
This is also inaccurate
The main feature of the Hungarian language is the ability to invent and infinitely chain together curse words similarly to writing a poem
GECI
Too
ló fasz is another decent one, translates to horse cock and can be used very creatively lol
Had to scroll too much to find this
Nah i use kurva as a word by it self
You can also chain swear words almost infinitely, like a combo
OP is upset in their comment history about the waiting times on GTAOnline because of Russian players
Yep, you cannot single out one curseword from the infinity of hungarian cussing
Depends on the context
It could simply mean "period" (as in end of sentence) when you're really angry
JK of course it's a ~~course~~ curse word, it literally means "fuck [something/someone]".
I smiled really wide reading your comment because I can very clearly imagine the situation where your ancestors learned the word from Hungarian guys trying to make a broken machine work well and cursing the entire time, and concluded it must be a name for the machine
The word exists and is in use, but it just means whore, applied to either actual prostitutes or just generally to women you hate and want to offend
It's not widely used as the general curse word *fuck* like in Polish and I suppose in other Slavic languages
Lófaszt
Sadly as previously mentioned in situations where polish people use KURWWWA hungarians say BAAAAZDMEG
"Kurva" means "whore" in hungarian so it's used only in sentences like "a jó kurva isten basszon meg a retkes faszával the gennyes rohadék" and such poetic constructions
That's so mild I even heard it on a kiddie playground
Let me join this contest with a classic

Mihelyst a lány egy pillanatra eltávozik, a két fiú között a következő párbeszéd alakul ki:

>– Á!
>– *Át akarsz baszni*, mi
>– Ne *basztass* már! *Basznám*, *baszod*, de *rábasztam*: *baszik* *baszni*, *baszd meg*!
>– Ez *bebaszott*!
>– Ezt *kibaszottul* *elbasztam*! *Bassza meg*!
A complete conversation using various form of a single verb only (baszni, to fuck), but using it 13 times giving it 11 different meanings
Translation below, I tried to use forms of *fuck* wherever I could but I missed two of them (highlighted in bold)
>A girl is on a date with a guy
The guy's friend is watching in the background
When the girl leaves the scene for a moment, the boys engage in the following conversation:
>– You're fucking her, ain't you
>– Nope
>– You're **lying to me**, ain't you
>– Stop fucking with me
I would fuck her, fuck you, but I fucked up: she **won't** fuck me, fuck you
>– This is fucked
>– I fucked up so fucking much
Fuck it
edited for line breaks
Learned this a couple of years ago here on reddit and i'm still amused
So its like the word huncut in hungarian, which is mostly used to describe impish, miscivous (but good natured) kids
The word started its life as hundefotze (dogs vagina), used by austrian soldiers to describe prostitutes
"franc" actually means/used to mean syphilis, and as you might know as a Franc (I just found out) people used to call it French disease, because you kinky fucks started the whole thing apparently
And it remained in the language as an actual curse word and now a cuss word
Just don't take it personally
If that's any better we actually say francia when we're referring to anything French now, while the word franc does not directly relate to your nationality anymore
Így már annyira azért nem is szomorú :)

We have the replica of this Castle In Budapest, one of the best looking Hungarian castles ever
Szevasz
Ctrl C - Ctrl V in Budapest
Szöröstalpúak belopták a várunk
Fuck you for stealing our castle
It’s the Hunyadi family, Hunyadi János who erected this castle was regent of Hungary, later his son Mátyás/Matthias was king of Hungary
Black Army time
Ezt az eredetit is mi építettük
Szevasz
Says the Romanian nationalist
Tudom én, de okkal nem Vajdahunyad Vára névvel posztolja ki, kompenzál valamit én úgy érzem
Tudjuk, nem tűnt még föl hogy amiket ezek posztolnak azokat az esetek felében mi építettük?
No, Hunyadi János Hungarian regent built this in the 1500s, its an important Hungarian cultural site so it was remade in Budapest for the 1001 year anniversary of the Hungarian kingdom
[Here is the story of the one in Budapest ]
The anglo saxons, the romanians and everyone who made that treaty
Dyslexic kingdoms
Szerintem tudjuk kik, most itt feleslegesnek érzem, hogy kirobbantsunk egy ilyen vitát, csak downvoteolnának a picsába és ennyi
That wasn’t the message I got from your first comment
Who told you I am mad
It only gets annoying when Romanians start claiming Mátyás Király, like he existed before nations had an identity, was a Hungarian king and was born in Kolozsvár and spoke Hungarian, he probably had Romanian ancestors but claiming him is a stretch
But we are talking about this one, and this one was erected by Hungarians
>	is not like half of the noble famillies from Transylvania have romanian/pechen/cuman/slavic origins
Yeah, it’s not like that as you said
Kendeffy:
And yes Dagffy apperently did have olah ancestors on one side, but I don’t really see the point
So you managed to point out two of thousands, one of which wasn’t even true
We just pointed out that whenever there is a pic about “beautiful Romania” it’s alway a pic about a Transylvanian city center built by us in the 19th century, and old town built by us or the saxons, or an old castle built by us in the middle ages passed off as Romanian
achievements
Which is fine you do you, just don’t act so offended when we point that out
Most of them speak Hungarian, and that’s their mother tongue
What’s your point
No one claims that, we known that Transylvania was and is diverse
Yes, no one cared about what nationality are you in 1500s so trying to claim this castle is dumb
I meant that it was ordered to be built by a Hungarian my bad
Just because there were Hungarian engineers at the building of the Suez Canal I don’t claim it’s partly a Hungarian achievement
The same way just because Temesvár bordered vlach regions it doesn’t mean they had anything to do with it, the same line of thought would led to me say Vienna is a partly Hungarian achievement
As for the Austrian part, even during those times Hungary had significant autonomy, with different laws and legislature from
the rest of the empire
But if we argue about semantics anything before 18th is not a Romanian achievement, because it didn’t exist yet
And all those places were built by Hungarians nobility
As for the family, you say official sources are not true regarding the family tree because they are Hungarian but a wikipedia page without any sources is the ultimate truth
Also you try to force on mediaval places the ethnographic map of Transylvania after Maria-Theresia and her invited Romanian settlers
Either way this whole discussion is not really worth my time, given 4th is coming soon we will have a lot of debates about it anyways
Clearly misunderstood my statement, I never said that ancestry doesn’t count, I said that it does not matter, if I’m born in France but I speak German follow German traditions and German is my mother tongue and i have German citizenship am I French
They know that, but just like everyone else from Eastern Europe, when they get defensive they resort to nationalism
Both Romanians and Hungarians
Ask the Székelys if they are Hungarians/Székelys or Romanians the answer won’t shock you
To be honest I wish I knew the answer
A civil conversation between Romanians and Hungarians
Impossible
Oh you are one nationalist idiot
Székelyföld is and was Hungarian majority since Hungarians arrived in the 800s
still has around a million Hungarians living there
[Umm what
Check the map where it describes the population
Edit: Im shit at maths
I made a mistake when adding up, how is that spewing Fidesz propaganda when I’m like the majority in Hungary is anti-Orbán
You are a huge idiot
Orbán altered the constitution he won majority in the parliament but more people voted against him, and despite that Fidesz lost the last major election, the opposition won Budapest a major blow to Fidesz and Orbán. You never made a mistake when looking at counties and accidently added one to the bunch when counting something, fuck off man
How am I an ultranationalist when you say thing like the Hungarians in Romania were given too much rights
Dude come one don’t even try to paint me as such when you meet their characteristics
Why should they show respect after 50 years of oppression
And yes after typing that shit down call me a nationalist again
That’s the reason why they protested in 1990 so that doesn’t seem right
Ceacuescu did some ethnic cleansing as well, and took away their autonomy
Hungary had to reach out to then OSCE because of constant human right violations and the mistreatment of the Hungarians in Romania, a country behind the Iron Curtain appealed, how bad is must have been

You are a Romanian for sure
And no, it wasn’t wiped out, it was broken into three pieces, one that was the Ottoman’s, the other was the Hapsburg’s, and the last one Transylvania
In 1699 it got reunited under the control of the Hapsburgs which later on became the Austro-Hungarian empire, which then broke up and Hungary got chopped to pieces, and Romanians were happy because they got to take 1/3 of Hungary’s land
And ever since spread lies about the whole situation the end
I await your reply where you call me a liar and bring up a lot of fake made up things that Romanians thought of to make it look like it wasn’t Hungarian anymore
Cheers
Buuuurn
You’re are so full of shit, Romanians did nothing in 1848 and were neither with or against it
Y’all were pathetic nobodies with nothing then so wtf are you going on about bitch
And during the Austro-Hungarian empire we OWNED your pathetic asses as the Hapsburgs gave Transylvania to Hungary, it really didn’t matter for them because either way they rules above it
I would say more but your bitch ass wont care so fuck it
Go on and believe your lies

Also, the EU zone is not homogeneous enough - and by that I don't only mean the fiscal policies
Theoretocally, if the labour force was more mobile etc, the EU zone could work perfectly, balancing out the internal differences (See the optimal currency theory:
And many of these criteria are not satisfied in the area, thus the internal differences cannot be resolved
One example is, that in the periphery even with lower prices, you can't benefit enough from your competitive advantage, bc the Germans just don't speng enough, create huge savings, instead of buying exports from you
Such structural problems thwart catching up
One idea is that first these descrepancies should be resolved, before joining the EU zone

What does underpay mean
They don't pay them the western wage
Just because they get small amount of money, it can be good in China, otherwise there would be no workers there
Mercedes and Audi also "underpay" Hungarian workers, because it is nowhere near western wage
Should these two and other offshored companies disappear as well
It is very likely
However still a lot of people choose Foxconn in China, and the reason is the pay is higher or something is more favourable for Chinese people over other companies
I have worked for one summer in a UK holiday park as a cleaner
It was horrible, I can't believe how bad the working conditions were
However me and other people from Hungary, Poland and Lithuania went there willingly because it was compensated by a lot of money (UK min wage)
I have worked in EY (financial audit) in Hungary
It was again horrible
It was not only horrible, but illegal what they did according to Hungarian law
I still worked there, because I got some valuable experience and a good salary compared to my lack of accounting knowledge
(now finally I am not overworked in a nice company, but I would not be here without EY experience)
Foxconn workers have a right to work in other companies
They choose Foxconn because the others are even shittier

Maybe, but since the values basically don’t overlap, and for all intents and purposes you have a green map and a red map,  it makes the two “backwards” from each other
It breaks the convention that we have all come to expect where gradient equals value with darker meaning more

As a serious question, if I travel to the US and visit their website, the law still applies to them
I'm still an EU citizen, and they still have to fulfill my request at providing me the data they have on me, and the right to delete all of that data

Right
The law is based on either residency or citizenship it seems
"**DO NON-EU BASED ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO COMPLY TO THE GDPR
If they process data or sell goods to EU citizens or have EU citizens as employees then yes, they need to comply
When talking about the need to comply to the GDPR, it all comes down to the individuals whose data you are processing
Whether you are selling goods, processing their data when they create an account on your website, or employing someone, if any of the people you work with is a EU citizen, the GDPR applies to you
" - eugdprcompliant
com
And as far as I've dug up things (during our own company's GDPR research) the EU legal structure allows you to move muscle on foreign companies, but as there is no precedent on how it actually can go down, it's something we'll see later
But yeah, to me it seems that just blocking EU IPs is only a temporary band-aid
As with many things in GDPR, intent is what matters in the end

I hope we can get rid of them on the next election but that would be a miracle
and we can't do anything about it sadly
Also it’s hard to topple the Orbán regime when half the current opposition was/is in the party that nearly bankrupted the country 12 years ago
Please don't feel ashamed
These are never for you
Or me
These cartoons is always about the leaders, not about the people
I'm sure the artist knows that a huge number of Polish and Hungarians does not like their governments
But you can't fit that in a cartoon like this
Good luck bud

>I hope we can get rid of them on the next election but that would be a miracle
Well the opposition always does a perfect job of looking at best as trustworthy as Orban
We have alternatives like "Kurcsány"\_Ferenc
party, the guys who think that puppet regime installed at gunpoint by waffen SS was an utopia, our greentards who shown multiple times that they want to replace nuclear with fossil fuel in the middle of climate crysis
...frankly the two-tailed dog (joke) party is the LEAST insane option
It just feels so stupid, boot the fuckers and we actually have a chance to elect someone better
My mother voted FIDESZ for 10 years because how she hates Gyurcsány specifically
You're not Hungarian
How would you know, why our system is bad
Describing this to foreigners is difficult
But to give you an example: what you see here, as the topic of this post, is currently used by our government as propaganda, to show us how bad the EU is the members of the EU are oppressors, and they want to silence our politicians and we should hate them as the UK did
Yo it was a joke
I hate redditors they are always so cold and agressive
Why are you telling yourself to shut the fuck up
Countryside where people don't know any better, as well as granting citizenship (and i assume money) to people living abroad in exchange for votes
Plus i wouldn't be surprised if there's additional vote
laundering
Faking idk
Considering how the current goverment can probably sense their end, I don't even want to know what disgusting tactics they'll use when elections begin
He does not have 50%, it's fourty-something percent
Imagine getting informed by a random reddit comment
Sorry i'm not too familiar with politics, if they fuck up i keep note but usually i don't bother with politics
Well, i'll have to vote next elections so i gotta eventually
I do remembet however, that this whole controversy was around last elections where he supposedly received 2/3 of votes despite more than 50% of the population not voting for him, thus demanding a recount
That's when this was found out
Sorry i couldnt be much of help, hopefully other fellow redditors can give more insight
Yes, it was with bags of potatoes
Exactly, though afaik they're planning on uniting for the next elections to dethrone fidesz
Yep, these next 2 years are gonna be tough
but I guess whoever is willing to fix education, healthcare etc the most will receive the most votes
I do hope we get to pick the best of the good parties and not the least awful from the worst

Good job friend
Happy independence day Finland
I think I'll visit more and more there in the future as lots of my friends starts to live there
: /
I think the Hungarian one is realistic, I agree
>The truth is that those rural areas were never forgotten, urbanization is the future
Centralised agriculture doesn't work, you can't drive the machinery from the nearest city to the edge of the country every day
The current state of urbanisation is already barely sustainable, housing crisis, wage gaps, modern slavery etc
I don't know why you think it's the future
Science fiction megapolises never mention how services are handled or who supplies them
Well, 60% in Poland is urban, 54 in Romania, 77 in Germany
Hungary is 71%. I don't think you want to go down this route
In Hungary, there's less and less people willing to work in agriculture and full automation is still far away
The eastern half of the country is depopulating at an alarming rate
If this goes on, and it will, because lack of population->lack of businesses->lack of jobs->lack of demand->lack of businesses
It drives itself after a critical point which Hungary already reached and it's freaking hard to turn back
And if you narrow it down to a village it's 0%. The regions aren't physically separated and there's no language barrier so there's no reason to do parallel statistics
> Demographics of Poland are more complicated than simple average 60% degree of urbanization
It was your argument that you need a higher percent
I said it's a trap
People need liveable towns, not large cities
When you find more joy in organizing your things at home than actually using them
Where do I sign up, and what's the pay
How do people even start doing stuff like this
I am genuinely curious
I mean I imagine its not like signing up for a regular job
Ah, international wafferhandler
You have to supply Germany's friends with waffers
Belgische Waffel für die Welt
I know this is a serious topic, but his name if I am correct is pronounced something like "Lyukash" which in Hungarian means something with a hole in it
So it sort of makes sense, doesn't it
Could you post a link to some source
Looks like one of those synthwave cyberspace bacgrounds with the purple mesh floor

how
And there’s my sweet little Hungary
And then you have western countries flying in workers to pick their vegetables
The natural tendency of the developed nations to incears the number of people in higher education
It has a strong correlation with the shift from manufacturing to knowledge-intensive sectors
Some people just don't know how to do sarcasm so the indicator helps to point out that an attempt was made

Nah they are mostly just gay people I think
> Eastern Europe is still homophobic as well with the exception of Czechia maybe, and they're harsher than the Turks
yeaaaah, no
How come it has a different centering
Brexit is like when parents ask a kid to help them with chores, and they run away xD
haha here we go
Just look at those banana curves lol
I didn't but there was a kid in my village who one day didn't get off the bus we took to go to school went to the end station in the nearby city
The story never really unfolded because local relatives found him soon after
He was missing a few cogs in the head as it turned out
Change
Radical change,  especially one that you and your friends can influence is such a good oportunity to make a lot of money into even more money
People of course will suffer greatly, but that is a sacrifice they are willing to make
Happy national day
Since someone told me about the secret of the Romanian border here in r/Europe I can't see it as anything else but a fish

Some parents probably teach their child to hate the country
I don't see straight-up fans of EU here often (even if you're disappointed in this post) so let me grab this opportunity to ask what is that you still like about it today
Things like Schengen/freedom of work/legal harmonization - while hard topics - are things that any reasonable alliance can achieve fast
Trophy bills like GDPR are neat, but are drop in the ocean in the long run
Huge difference between member states, ignorance to do anything about it, endless naivity of the founders, shallow agreements as a result, and the general fear of falling apart (and thus supporting outright autocracies) made EU a weak, anguished entity destined to fall
As a federalist, I see EU as the greatest obstacle towards it
Well, he is a member of Fidesz, so it was expected
What I find strange, is that there aren't any news in Hungary mentioning the vote
(Probably because almost all news sites are controlled by Fidesz)
I can tell you guy a little secret about fast Eastern European internet
ISPs were owned by western parent companies for a long time, and they wanted western level subscription fees
Then a few domestic ISPs emerged, bought cheap Chinese equipment (ZTE/Huawei), used road side poles for fiber and suddenly everyone had 1Gbps at home
You will run ADSL as long as that "return of investment" stuff is not done on the Siemens boxes
The data isn't really comparable
The US has 50k reported cases the EU has 82k. But the CDC paper gives an estimate:
> Accounting for underdiagnosis, Salmonella causes an estimated 1
2 million illnesses annually in the United States, approximately 1 million of which are transmitted by food consumed in the United States
Which means the reporting rate isn't exactly high
It's not cases reported to doctors, it's cases reported to FoodNet and ECDC
Without knowing the reporting rate, comparing the two is meaningless
This is the mountain on Toblerone, right

What if they never had it to begin with
I’m not saying we had it all along but from the 10th century to the 16th (Turkish stuff) we had it conquered and under control
From there I don’t argue since it gets way too complicated
Conquered in the 10th century, yes
But isn’t that long enough ago to get to keep and say we’ve had it more is the question
I don’t care though I like Hungary right now too and I’d like it bigger as well, doesn’t matter for me
Ok this thread is weird, usually it’s just the “never had it and never should’ve” stuff I hear, then I get irrationally angry but then I also remember I have a large amount of Romanian in me along with a few others, man it gets confusing looking at the Romania Hungary dispute
i have never heard about san marino, where is it
Same with Hungarian
Only you bump into Hungarians wherever you go
Reminds me of [this] video
I like how the german is just sitting there in his suit, like:
„Can we get this over with
I have to go the bank
The roma one ofc
Why exactly
They are still different ethnic groups
Romania is doing the same to the Hungarians what Hungary did 100 years ago to the Romanians
Be a bigger man
Break the cycle
Hate all people
Found the nationalist
I mean the way you speak about Hungarians I wouldn’t want to learn Romanian either, if I would live there
Imagine having Transylvania and somehow still being this salty about it
Great underdog narrative there, mate
*YwY
Feels like something out of a Witcher like game
Absolutely astonishing
Very cool already Austria
This is extremely common in central-eastern Europe, I live in Hungary and we did this until the early 00s, and still have the system installed as a backup
Here's the high resolution version:
Hey, this is in the new [Vsauce video]
I figured there could be a bigger version, so I right-clicked the image in Chrome and hit "Search Google for this image". It brings up a page with "Find other sizes of this image: All sizes - Medium - Large" and I clicked Large
This is a really amazing feature of Google, it tracks images and knows which are scaled versions of each other
Never understood why a country would not extradite their citizens, when the supposed crime is a crime in their own country as well, and getting a fair trial is assured
If I know that a fellow citizen is indicted for a crime I would want them to either clear their name or bear the consequences of their actions, regardless where they did or what they did
The person in question is a German-Polish dual citizen, not a migrant
Why would Switzerland try a crime that happened in a different country
And how
I am fairly certain they would not have the witnesses travel around the world for the trial
Hell, likely the courts wouldn't even entertain them, because the Swiss authorities do not have standing in a case related to a completely different country not under their jurisdiction
There was supposed to be a big change after the end of the Soviet Union
I dunno why bash May
she was/is a remainer, she's in damage control mode
Crucify Cameron, he gambled UK's future
Good thing I live next to Austria, today wasn't even that hot
Okey guys, time to move to Austria
Maybe we can survive this summer there
Damn UK, how you holding up
r/unexpectedspanishinquisition
I kind of understand why people from the UK don't really learn a foreign language, English is one of the major languages, people learning foreign languages usually learn that
For example: there are many people in their mid-late 20s here, in Hungary who don't speak a foreign language well or at all
Lately universities required language certificates for graduation, now it requires for admission too, that makes a bit more people learn a foreign language
Damn, the fucking Romanians beat us again
rule britannia
They asked erasmus students didnt they, because this in no way reflects reality
I saw hungary and was like damn thats cool then i scrolled down
In hungary its english sometimes german
Reasons for Hungary could include: huge preference for dubbed TV/movies, historical language reform movements, the difficulty of integrating foreign words into our language because of suffixes/prefixxes, very different vowel/consonant sounds from english, formerly part of te ~~USSR~~ eastern bloc, low income cizizens can't afford to travel, english classes in elementary/high school are 90% in hungarian except for vocab/reading (doesn't teach you to actually practical use)
in hungary everything is dubbed from operating systems, movies, even the least known ones
You can avoid any foreign language completely, like a russia or china
For older hungarians it's german, younger ones (after the communism collapse) english (no surprise)
As a lot of hungarians moved here from the neighbouring countries there are a lot of folks who speak one of the neighbouring languages - ukrainian/russian, serb, croatian, romanian, slovakian
One by one those languages are not much, but as around a million people immigrated, taken together it must be a lot
> english classes in elementary/high school are 90% in hungarian
Wait, you mean they don't teach it the same way in other countries
I mean, teaching any foreign language in said language when the students don't yet possess sufficient grammatical and/or vocabulary knowledge doesn't sound very practical to me
about half a million Hungarians live in Slovakia a lot of whom I suspect are bilingual, also you shouldn't take my opinions for granted nor should you the article
it's just mentioned, ofc it's not the biggest part of it
The other reasons (like english classes being hungarian basically) are why we are so shit
yea that should be the norm, but what we're talking about here is that some english lessons go by without speaking any english
Like the best student will answer every question, the others would just hang on their phones
I also witnessed some oral presentations where the guy spoke hungarian and the teacher translated it for him
At this point I actually can't fucking believe this
It just became a competition, I can't wait to see the next one
iS tHaT a JoJo'S ReFrEnCe

The line between the Eastern and western/central powers is clearly visible
Hmm
You've got a couple of misleading facts there:
ASTRA founded a network of libraries, not schools, and it's founding members came from Transylvania, not the Kingdom of Romania
In fact, its first president was born in Miskolc, a city in northeastern Hungary
It is true that magyarization policies had a negative effect on minority-language education, however Transylvania still had more Romanian-language schools in 1918 than the Kingdom of Romania despite having one third the population (of Romanians)
Doesnt really work for us, not every day but a week multiple times I get random calls that try to sell me stuff, rarely dumb religion ads and once I got an offer for a prostate exam
My ass is blocked not the calls
FIDESZ always calls people before election to do propaganda surveys
That bunching up at the low forties suggests that the data is false

Gives me heavy LOTR vibes
Was literally there 2 weeks ago before these were installed
Honestly I don't know why they did this, maybe they meant it to face lake Velence but something went wrong
But, why
Just saw these yesterday and laughed out loud like some weirdo with no one near me
(Velencei-tó    Lake Velence)
No, it's Lake Velence
"Wudj" accent on the dj (I'm not polish but visited this lovely city for work)
The second Proto-Uralic origin of the Hungarian one refers to the word "month" as "hó, hónap"
But the first one seems correct
"from proto-Uralic: kume" --> hó
just hungarian things
Hungarian is such a beautifully stupid language
Persze hogy narancssárgák lettünk lol
No, because "hó" and "ho" don't sound the same
To your eyes it might as well be, but to us it can be a huge difference
For example: *kurta* means 'curt', while *kúrta* '(he or she) shagged'.
Languages are fun
And "kar" means "arm" in Hungarian
And 'arm' in Hungarian
Huh, 'kár' means dick in Hungarian and comes from the Roma language
Maybe related
Please treat the burnt areas immediately
It is h**ó**, not ~~ho~~.
It is similar to Samoyed *chav* "upper hard part of snow"
* In the root part *m* đ *v* happened (just like in the word "attic": Finnish *komo*/*komi*, Khanty *kom* that in Hungarian became *hiu*)
* Also, *k* đ *h* happened according to a regular rule (as in the word "fish": Mansi *kul*, Mordvin *kal*, Finnish, Estonian *kala*, Samoyed *halle* that in Hungarian became *hal*)
That's pretty neat because "hó" is also originated from "moon" ("Hold" in Hungarian) the other part of it "nap" is either "sun" or "day" but I haven't looked it up yet
'Kar' is indeed arm in Hungarian, 'kár' on the other hand isn't
Wow, I didn't know hónap was from hold and nap, but actually it makes perfect sense, thanks
> Condom, the route is much safer
Hmm, you don't say
we have a similar river bus in Budapest also
always looks intriguing but never actually ridden in one though
Does this apply for the whole EU
Not sure about elsewhere but here in Hungary your money gets fucked by paying for taking out money from the ATMs, random fees taken off to "keep up" the bank card, etc
Looks like the climb to Alpental in Washington state during the summer
You can get far with Polish in hotels and restaurants
