In the late 70s and early 80s we were quite close to a ‘civil war’,  with many similar incidents like the link happening over a period of a decade, the hatred between the 2 parties is still very strong today
I approve this message
Thank you for wanting to kill me complete stranger
I would like to choose Austria for some unknown reason
Unfortunately (or fortunately), Malta's total greenhouse gas emissions only add up to around 0
01% of the global total
I don't. Especially since I live near the sea
Some of us want to live yk
In other words

As a Maltese I thank you
That is true
History lessons are boring
Yes I am maltese
I'm watching the documentary now, but not sure that I want to continue watching as it is so sad
More shocking still is that medicine has not been able to offer a solution and has been reduced to helping the patient kill herself
I mean she is in her 20s and physically healthy
I can understand when euthanasia is considered for an elderly person with a terminal illness
I had one relative who spent the last 10 years of her life in bed in constant pain
I was there when she once asked a doctor to give her something to help her end it all
But euthanasia is illegal in my country
What I find scary is that if I am ever in her position I would not be able to get help to end it all so I agree with Euthanasia in such cases
In Switzerland organisations such as EXIT assist with Euthanasia and their model addresses some of the common concerns raised by euthanasia
Yes sometimes I do especially due to the nature of work where we communicate a lot cross country
I'll try to keep communication with natives with mother tongue so I don't forget it
It use to be Valletta, the capital city, was one of the poorest areas in Malta, but has boomed the last 10 years
I’d say maybe now Paceville, the clubbing city, ironically named, full of drunk people, piss and throw up, fun when it needs to be but would be hell to live there
> Copenhagen is gorgeous
Such a gorgeous city

We've experienced the [driest February ever recorded] Well, at least since our Met Office started compiling data in 1923
This is the second winter with basically no rain, [2016] was also a very bad year
Last year, in February, we experienced one of the most intense storm surge with hurricane strength winds
In 50 years time, [my country is going to become unlivable]
We could, I don’t agree with FIFA and the slave labour of Qatar, but it’s not like a team that gets kicked out straight away will have much of a difference
We'll win the world cup this time, have hope
Band clubs closing (happening), no village feasts (groups of over 250 banned, soon to be much less), and no traffic for once
Can't say the same here since Italians like to make their presence known by screaming at you in Italian
Same goes for us i guess
But I think it depends on the generation
I thought Iceland was
from Iceland
Turns out its English
Apart from free healthcare for its citizens, every EU country has an agreement with other EU countries so that if the national of one country is abroad and something happens they get free healthcare in the foreign country too
One question for people from the USA: You pay some social security, right
How much does it cost and what does it cover
I am in Europe and most healthcare is publicly funded
State hospitals are the best and they are where you go for something really serious
For example when I had an accident I just called the emergency number, an ambulance came, I was taken to the ER, medicated, x-rays, and given an appointment for meeting with a consultant
There are no bills
If you need medicines while you are in hospital they are free
If you are not in hospital you usually pay for medicines, unless you have a chronic condition
So a one off medicine like an antibiotic is something that you buy from a pharmacy, but if you have something chronic like diabetes, hypertension, etc
, you get free medicine
General practitioners are also provided by the state but most people prefer to go to a private GP as the cost is low and it is not something frequent
We pay around 10% of what we earn for national insurance
This covers all health issues and our pension
We can also pay an extra private insurance for private medical care
The advantage to private care is that waiting lists are shorter but for really serious things like let's say by pass surgery, it is something always carried out in state hospitals
jelenecek - I am not sure that I understand all your figures, mainly because you sometimes use a comma ( , ) and at other times a fullstop ( .) between numbers
So when you say that a visit to a GP costs  € 7,26 do you mean 7 euros and 26 cents
If that is the case it is very similar to what we pay in Malta
GPs charge anything from 5 to 15 Euros depending on things like the place where they are located and how in demand they are
It is generally considered a very reasonable charge especially since most people only need to see a GP once or twice a year
Not really, unless you have a filter which is pretty costly, government water smells and tastes abit of chlorine so it’s not the best
But a lot of houses have wells where they buy water from the water table
(From government regulated suppliers)
Very similar to Malta, it’s out of respect I guess, take an hour leave out on a suit and go back to work after
Maybe also a Catholic thing
We have this with villages here in Malta, and we are tiny
Yet local patriotism is still a thing, I would guess it’s human nature to be proud of the community you are brought up in
Has happened here too
As we are so tiny plenty of villages have merged, but they kept they’re names, you can just step into one village and on the other side of the street it’s another
Do people actually play rugby
Since we don’t have any mountains I’d say no :p but if you go walking early mornings you will have a few people who would say hello or good morning, other than that we don’t.

I was in Barcelona and I rented a tricycle to go around as I cannot ride bikes
I ended up going through the Ramblas, even though I was later told that I shouldn't have
but anyway
On the Ramblas, I heard a guy talking in Maltese and I stopped cycling
Having not heard Maltese in a while, I was surprised
When I got to continue cycling, I hit the Maltese man with the tricycle and he was in the middle of a Maltese swear phrase when I told him that I am sorry in Maltese
He then told me that it's ok
As a Maltese, knowing what swear phrase that person must have used makes this a million times funnier
Yes indeed
I'm a girl
He used a nice haqq al and stopped there, thankfully :D
What do you mean
In Maltese it also means something similar like in Arabic, however haqq in Maltese is the beginning of a swear phrase
Cannot explain well
My Italy-obsessed dad loves Calabria because it's beautiful
Fuck the Mafia man, Italy would be almost perfect if it weren't for those parasites
Erm, yes that too
Well we joke about defences and not being conquered, since we were always amidst battles and cross continents hehe
the school system
i just don't understand it because the one we have is completely different
thank you
Hey
Well, coronavirus cases are rising, we have like 300 in about 3 weeks (im not sure), everyone is bored and most people are too scared to leave their houses so i guess it isn't the best here :')
Nope, not for now
Thank you, same to you
Below 10 in winter, Summer is a wasteland here so anything below 30 is a Godsend
“Maltese, like the dog
“You’re from Malta
so you’re Italian
Close to 0 here in Malta, as it’s illegal last time I checked
0% here, it's technically illegal
Same with Malta, but with a loooot more swearing
A Maltese person that hates pastizzi
Thank you Italy for the food and caffè.
Thank you Spain for siesta
Thank you Britain for the afternoon tea
Thank you Greece and Turkey for sweets
Thank you all Europeans for keeping us afloat and being where we are now and sorry for ripping off everyone's delicacies and making our own version
Thank you Italy and Germany for [bombing] [the] [hell] out of us during WW2 and showing the world how truly resilient my country & forefathers were
Gozo
Sister island :)
Exactly the same in Malta
Fun to go for a few days, with a desert trip and a trip to the mosque in abu dabi, and maybe a water park
That’s it really
'Become' in English is a stative verb but in German  'bekommen' means 'to get'. I was confused for a while when I heard a German ask a bartender 'Can I become a coffee, please
Pretty much exactly like us
( except the drive to the alps part haha) but we have a ferry to Sicily so that’s an ‘easy’ escape
Still wouldn’t mind to live and work in different countries, travel abit and experience various cultures
Cannot say it was popular but it was fairly common
My father had one and as you said quite roomy and felt adventurous everytime i rode in it
And yes there were the ricers as well
Decently popular
At least you could have seen a few at that time, when we were snuggling up to the USSR states
This, I remember being afraid to keep the light on in the bathroom because otherwise I would be showering with the moths next morning
Have not seen ones so big in a long long time
We're quite Catholic and I've never seen anything like this in my life
Italian :) maybe Arab if written with Latin characters
I've heard that Tunisian people can understand malti pretty well
Pastizzi - a savoury pastry traditionally filled with peas or ricotta
They look like vulvas and in fact pastizz is slang for vulva
Pastizzi, which pretty much are savory pastries filled with either pea filling or cheese filling
They're delicious
Pretty common, lots of houses have flag poles for  various feasts and holidays, so they would a Maltese one handy
Right now you would see quite a few, as we had our first 0 cases since the start of this, people are feeling patriotic
This one where the prime minister is waving goodbye to the last of the British Royal Navy ships as they leave the Grand Harbour
This was the day Malta was no longer used as a British military base
The smaller the country the worse this is I think, Malta is a great example
I would also add the Megalithic Temples here in Malta, potentially the oldest man made structures in existence
We're Mediterranean too
Can understand majority of the paragraph and make a gist
But Spanish for some reason feels very different to me
Lots of people disagree with us including the cross of st
george on the top right, but I don’t mind it
Adds quite abit of history
It was given to us as a action by the King of England after WW2, for our bravery
But some see it as a reminder that we were nothing but a colony and a base for the British for a 100 years
Nooooo not at all
It's very common for kids to stay with their parents for a long time here
And I've never heard of anyone paying rent or helping with bills even if they have a good job
We're 5 kids and my sister moved out less than a year ago at 32
My brother is 30 and doesn't seem to be moving out any time soon
Property is expensive here so most parents try to help their kids until they can have a proper home instead of a cheap room for rent
Now how's about you reciprocate that kindness and show a Maltese around Scotland
Haha
We only have one
It’s quite good, our education system is pretty decent
Malta is the meaning of corruption
Oof
More than we would like to admit
I don't really get involved with politics so i can't go into detail but the past prime minister ruined the country, and  now the new one has to sort out all the shit he did
Elizebeth
Or maybe the grandmasters of the knights would be acceptable
If those parameters are small than I honestly accept the title of micro state now :(
Our hospital took around 12 years to build, granted lately public projects have become more efficient
Our supermarkets are opening at 4am, and toilet paper, pasta and anything with antiseptic properties are pretty much sold out
&#x200B;
This
anything that's unique but dumb
a name like Lora would get you easily judged
Uhm
Yea trains
won't be a thing here :|
The Italian influence on our food
Love it
Kinnie
A soda made from bitter oranges and the peels, it’s bitter, and abit sweet, but extremely refreshing
Similar to Kinnotto in Italy :)
Was looking for this
Hmmm e have Kinnie in Malta :) pretty much a copy of Chinotto, extremely refreshing
My father lived through Nazi germany, what happened, the atrocities, the power hungry officials are talked about all the time, documentaries and news stories are shown continuously
They do not hide their history, but they try learn from it
We had a string of car bombings in 2015-2017, two drug lord families were fighting to be number one
As long as it was only criminals endangering themselves the police didn’t mind, then we had the assassination of DCG, that had a huge effect on the country, and how we are seen internationally
/sad neighbouring noises  heheeh
Aww, thanks for tea and biscuits i guess
Don't worry, we're used to be forgotten  hehe
But we still love you
Same here in Malta

Correction fluid is TippEx, was very confused when a friend had asked for correction liquid once, those cylinders that keep soup and coffee warm are called Thermos, vacuum is Hoover, I’m sure there are plenty more which I cannot remember at the moment
You really gave me a yearning for some Chupa-Chups now
That sounds dirty
Several years ago I crossed from Austria to Hungary several times in just a few days
My passport was checked by the Hungarians
More recently I had to visit Belgium but the most convenient flight landed in the Netherlands
Someone picked me up at the airport and we drove straight to Belgium
There was no checking of passports or ID
Yes - it was in the 1990s.
We have a few new ones which, not to offend, are somewhat ridiculous, Xaznaya, Xenaia, Xachary, pretty much any name they could fit an x(sh) in the front
There use to be a journalist that was a thorn in the government’s side, and to some of the rich
She was assassinated
The Maltese parliament, looks like a cheese grater
Considering Valletta is full of amazing old palaces built by the Knights, this, at the entrance of the city, is just horrible
Yes
There is a religion subject in all schools, which teaches Roman Catholicism
From kindergarten all the way up to the end of secondary school
Constitution of Malta
Article 2
3 "Religious teaching of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Faith shall be provided in all State schools as part of compulsory education
We are currently pissing them off with our immigration policies and lack of anti money laundering policies (although that’s doing mu better now with the new commissioner), we are tiny, neutral, and would not make a single difference to the EU, apart from maybe being potentially a base in the Mediterranean, abandoning our neutrality, and as a sunny destination for a holiday :)
Oi dint forget about the little colony that could :p
Quite a few businesses are planning to come here already, we also have a very favorable corporation tax, as you guys do
Yepp :) it’s a national language, that and Maltese :) id say 60% are fluent in both, and the rest are mainly focused on Maltese, with a good basic understanding of English, that can easily be improved
I would say people taking advantage of it
Going there for practically no reason, wow I stubbed my toe let me go and waste half an hour of a doctors time to check if it’s broken, when it obviously isn’t. But really nothing else I can think of
Maltese is pretty much Arabic mixed with Italian, French and various Latin aspects :)
my school spoils tf out of us, but we start at 7
55 and finish at 13

Sort of side question, is Bastille Day celebrated in the Vendee region
I remember finding a source in secondary school saying that the region didn't celebrate it because of the uprising there, but never did any further research into it
maltese
i'm maltese
yeah, but i still find it difficult to write and stuff
No, the tap water tastes really bad unless you have a filter installed to get rid of the excess particulates
It is both normal to drink and not drink from the tap in Malta
Some town's tastes better than others, thats why
Lol try 2011
Yup
I mean we have a bit of a ways to go as any type of abortion is a criminal act here
A true Maltese classic ; tqiq , meaning flour
It uses the phonetic gutteral Q which mostly exists in arabic based languages so its always a bit funny to watch people try and say it
Siehbi, Habib :) both mean friend, we use the normal causal one you listed above aswell, we have some ‘crude’ ones as well, like Kink, or Ras, which literally means head, or figuratively means head of the penis
(Still a term of endearment though haha)
At one point we also had Sex, as in, the word, as a sign of hello, like ‘Hey Sex’, also slightly crude :p
Well, fireworks celebrate country here
We would find every excuse summer or winter where we can try shoot up fireworks, be it a feast, wedding or some kind of victory celebration haha
We have them every day of the summer
From 8am all day and all night till about 1 am
Yep, they're still everywhere actually
And in Malta they still hold a place which is under their political jurisdiction even though it's within the island
Actually it's st Angelo :)
Well in Malta some people (mostly from the north) will just speak in English to each other
So it would be a group of Maltese people but they'll just speak in English or a Maltese/ English hybrid
Since English is also an official language, it's normal for us to start a convo in English and just keep speaking English or just constantly keep switching  from Maltese to English
I think university
Here, uni is not only free, but you get paid a monthly stipend and a [Maintenance Grant ] at the beginning of the first semester, which varies from ~400 to ~900-1000 (depending on the subject and year, cause in first year you get more)
The grant is also doubled for people who face certain financial difficulties (parents are divorced, they may live alone or if one of their parents passed away)

Welcome to the Mediterranean life
Our obvious one involves the (ongoing) story behind Daphne Caruana Galizia's murder, where there were political links tied to the murder
The government did not collapse per se, but it saw the ruling Labour party's leader and Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, resign
His successor, current Prime Minister Robert Abela, brought about quite a bit of reshuffling, even convincing an MEP to step away from Brussels in his second reshuffle within his first year of premiership
The less obvious collapse of government, and some Maltese people might not agree with me, was the 2013 Budget being rejected in parliament, when a member of the Nationalist party voted together with the Opposition
This, as well as then-Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi's unwillingness to vote in favour of the introduction of divorce in the country (which people approved of as per a referendum), shortened the government's legislature by a few weeks, with the government dissolving prematurely because of loss of confidence
The general election was due anyways, which is why people might not agree on this instance being a collapse of government
English is a first language here (alongside Maltese) so almost everyone under the age of 70 can speak it or has a general understanding of it
It's taught in schools and given the same importance as Maltese (in some schools it's actually preferred, with the students being required to speak in English
) We're also taught a compulsory foreign language in secondary school (one of our choosing), with most people choosing Italian
In fact, when my parents were growing up, they only had Italian and Maltese channels on tv, so most people can understand Italian with more than half of the population probably being fluent
I saw a statistic that said 60% of the population is fluent in Italian but I can't remember where I saw it, but it seems accurate
Some people can also speak French
It's probably the most common after Italian due to its importance in Europe for work
But yea, pretty much the entire country is bilingual, with more than half being trilingual
What I like about Italy is its food
I have never been to any restaurant in Italy and not been happy with the food
Hope you get well soon
All of Mdina
You can't tell me a town from 700BC that has been pillaged countless times doesn't have ghosts
In Maltese the word ' u ' means ' and'. It is probably the most commonly used one ltter word the language
Bilingualism is super common in Malta
We have 2 national languages which are English and Maltese
Maltese is derived from the Semitic, Italian, Spanish, french and English languages
I'd say around 99% of Maltese speak some degree of English, although the large majority are very fluent
It is generally the old people and the poorer section of the population which do not speak English fluently
Both languages are taught simultaneously from kindergarden years
It is also becoming increasingly common that the two languages are mixed together in the same sentence, which I must admit is a bit weird at first, but it sometimes just comes out naturally
You would forget a word in Maltese and you say it in English instead to continue the conversation
Italian is a super common language especially with my generation and older
Italian TV came to Malta before the British TV, so naturally many children used to watch and learn Italian from cartoons
In recent years, the use of Italian has declined due to many English speaking channels and the introduction of French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Russian and Arabic languages in secondary schools
I can understand old Maltese pretty well
The difference mainly is the difference in letters
If there is a cup dangling from that pack and/or a beer bottle strapped somewhere, yep that's one
I challenge you: Cyprus
(though you can actually still easily tell in this generation
The last-last-last generation was more mixed)
Malta -- mainly three:
Generic Maltese:
Literrally no accent noticeable, spoken by about 70% of the entire Maltese population
Rural Maltese:
Spoken by people from more rural, less developed areas of Malta
Mostly prevelent in areas like Mgarr, Żebbuġ, Ħad-Dingli and a lot of localities in Gozo
Spoken by about 5% of the population, mostly old folk
*Pépé*-Maltese:
This is the hybrid Maltese-English dialect, where speakers will switch languages mid-conversation
Mostly frowned upon, however quite popular
Mostly spoken by people from St
Julian's and Sliema, at around 15% of the population
Although we are a tiny island of 400k, there are various dialects, Zurrieq switches alot of a to o, similar to our sister island Gozo, Sliema area speak more English then others, and elongate Maltese words, etc
Valletta has a somewhat specific pronunciation as well, then we have those who emigrated to Australia and Canada in the 70s and came back, having their own dialect
Contrary to the norm of learning foreign languages, I think or as far as I know our language (Maltese) is uniquely learnt in our schools
Doubt it can be easily offered abroad to teach like English or other languages since it is quite difficult to learn
Ye we have this too
It is literally in our Constitution
I’d consider us as kindof a micro state
Come visit when covid calms down, nice beaches and amazing history :D shit politicians though

There's a theory that there's a whole other city under our capital city, I honestly don't know much about them but we do have underground catacombs in more than one place on the island

We were the [most bombed country in the world ] at a point in history after suffering a 2 year siege during WW2 between 1940 and 1942
In total, 15,000 tonnes of bombs were dropped on our archipelago
We also have some of the oldest freestanding temples in the world, the ones at [Ħaġar Qim] older than the pyramids at giza
One of the two countries (now) that have English as a national language

I do it sometimes
Lol is it really though

These answers are so damn interesting, this sub is great
I hve a few aunties and uncles who are old enough to remember being under British rule very vividly, (1967ish it ended here), it was a different time, poverty and class differences ruled, the navy was the largest employer, huge parts of the islands were off limits, history is so interesting and important
I love how many people visit this little rock
Yes Valletta has had huge amounts of investment poured in the last 10 years, and it shows :) some parts of it use to be known as slums here back in the 70s
That's dark
Performing a violent crime against a woman and then singing about his neckwear
Government officials do here
It's a commonwealth thing since we were a colony
But the populace doesn't. And i think nowadays  the population doesn't care
But since it's a national thing, the government does it for that day during the commemorative ceremony and that's it
I think it became more if a commonwealth obligation lol
Everyone who mentioned Italian knows it in Maltese without knowing
In Italian it’s grazie and in Maltese it’s grazzi

To even get people up to the top of such events, you'd have to construct a complicated chair/belt pulley system just to drag people up the mountain
I cannot see anyone paying for that
There could also be tables on the side for participants to scoop up a fresh baguette and Parma ham trimmings as they run
We had a man who ran for prime minister, he was kicked out of his home by his wife, lived in a small garage and was genuinely abit crazy, he gathered huge crowds, even though it was more to laugh at his ideas rather then to actually support him

Such a beautiful and pleasant fortress city
Vik is also beautiful, just really small with not much to do but absolutely stunning
Oops not really no, more like a small town
The ottomans had a false report during the Great Siege, thinking 20000 troops were coming from Spain to reinforce us, in reality it was 2000, barely a force big enough to defend most forts
They retreated, if they had won, it would have been an easy fortified spot to launch attack onto Southern Europe
In Malta temperatures can reach the mid 30s very easily in Summer
If the milk is UHT milk it does not need to be refrigerated until it's opened
Then it is treated like normal milk
You take it out of the fridge for that one short moment when you need some in your coffee then dash it back to the fridge
Some people do not refrigerate eggs if they are going to cook them in a day or two
Some supermarkets do not refrigerate theirs either
But I put mine in the fridge as I am never sure for how long I'll have them
We put chocolate in the fridge in Summer as otherwise it will melt
Maybe depends which restaurant, medium price range family type ones would definitely pack it up for you to take home if you asked
Assassinated a journalist who kept revealing what actually happens in the government
We have three
These are:
1) The capital city [Valletta] constructed by the Knights of Malta and named after the Grandmaster Jean Parisot de Vallette who led Malta to victory against a far larger invading force of Ottoman soldiers
2) The [Megalithic Temples of Malta] a collection of Stone Age temples scattered across the islands, that are among the oldest free-standing structures in the world
Mnajdra temple in particular is astronomically aligned, where the sun shines at the centre of an arch on the spring/autumn equinoxes
3) The [Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum] an underground tomb complex built during the Stone Age
The complex features an oracle room, that causes sounds made inside it to resonate throughout the complex
The Hal Saflieni Hypogeum, an underground structure dating back to 3600 BC, the Megalithic Temples, maybe around 6 total round the island I think
Extremely old structures, considered some of the oldest structures on earth
And the City of Valletta, our Capital City, a fortified city built to defend the Grand Harbor :)
'Europeans' is just a convenient word to lump many different nationalities that live in the same continent
Cultures vary between countries and even within countries
Personally, I avoid clothes with logos on them
Some of us consider wearing clothes with obvious logos as being ostentatious and a sign of 'new money'. I laugh inside when I see someone wearing a polo shirt with a huge Ralph Lauren emblem
Why on Earth would anyone want to pay a lot of money to serve as a walking advertising board
I am no expert when it comes to fashion but take top brands like Chanel: you are never going to see a real and elegant Chanel dress with a visible logo, but sophisticated women can tell that it is Chanel
As a man, I like a British outlet called Marks and Spencer
They have a long history of quality clothes
Their quality has probably fallen a little over the years but when it comes to basic wear I find that they are the best
Shirts come in lots of sizes, with half sizes in between the full sizes and even sleeve lengths are sized
The quality is excellent too but never have I seen anything of theirs with the brand showing
The name is hidden inside on a label
I'm actually quite happy about it
I am not from the UK but from a small EU country which was a colony of the UK
So we ended up with two official languages - one of them being English
Without English huge amounts of important literary and scientific works would not be available to me
In my country we also get a lot of students who come here to study English
They prefer us over the UK because we get 300 days of sunshine each year and beaches are everywhere
This year our economy is going to suffer though :(
But to be clear, English is not the most widely spoken language in the World
Mandarin is the language with the highest number of native speakers
Spanish is second and English comes third
However English is first when it comes to the number of people who can use it to some degree or other as a second language
many ppl know italian in my country
Malta
Eh kinda but it has more arabic
I definitely live closer to Tunisia than Greenland and unfortunately know more about Italian & English culture & customs than Tunisian
I've met a handful of North Africans from Libya, Tunisia and Egypt and they've always been really nice
Would love to visit any North African country (even Libya when the trouble there subsides)
Peak of the St John Knight period :) the ship aspect of AC has been hugely successful so this would be perfect, tiny medieval island full of forts and villages and old cities, religion, politics, with continuous Mediterranean Sea missions, pirates, trade, outposts in the rest of Europe and North Africa, maybe even a crusade
It can end with the great siege of Malta, would be fantastic
Honestly the trilogy of Ezio was amazing, 3 had a good setting but story was abit wonky, but introduced ship battles, 4 was pretty much pirates of the Caribbean, decent, since then I haven’t bought a new one, but would like to try the new rpg element of combat they’ve introduced
In Italy the traditional film for Christmas is Trading Places
In Malta, I don't know
Hamalli
Hahaha fuck that hit deep
In Malta everyone learns Maltese and English compulsory and then a third language can be chosen
It works pretty well, over 90% of the population is Bi-Lingual
Really
When did you come
Oh ok
Not separatist but the two political parties are at each other’s throats so much (and are so loyal to the party) that it feels like they are two movements that want to control the country
Honestly my city, mainly cause the majority of my friends are from the same city, or from the south of Malta, so we all enjoy picking at eachothers cities stereotypes etc
I don’t feel much national pride or identity when it comes to being Maltese tbh
I am Maltese, then European, then my town
Being from a small country changes the way you identify yourself
Playing caps and slammers, collecting Pokemon and Harry Potter stickers
I just say I’m sorry for your loss tbh
Always love this photo
You can feel the tension of the war through the screen
**Disadvantages**: Property prices are **SUPER** inflated meaning young adults are not able to move out from their parents house until they are about 30-35 years old because you need *at least* €10,000 to €15,000 as a deposit for a dinky apartment in a hideous area with 1 bedroom and no natural light
Land is super scarce so property prices are inflated to hell
Many people know each other or other families (especially in Gozo) so, while this leads to a sense of comradery, it also breeds conservatism for fear of being judged
Employment options are limited especially when it comes to science and research (specifically in Malta)
**Advantages**: Malta is one of the safest places in the world partly, I believe, because it's a microstate
I should move abroad
>and the lack of good public transport
Can confirm, 3 buses didn't show up today
Don't think Maltese would classify as beautifully sound
"Socialism is radical communism"
"Marxism is radical capitalism"
"Capitalism and communism are the same thing"
After I challenged them on it, they told me to "prove it".
[Elon Musk once made the same point unironically
A religion teacher (and an ex-member of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools)
[He also doubled down later on, with a criminally absurd (and self-contradictory) statement]
Ignoring the obvious daily report on Covid, we had the ongoing court case for the murder and assassination of Daphne Caruana Galazia, a journalist who was killed a couple years ago
As they have found the suspected man behind the murder
Ow sorry I misunderstood the question then
Hmmm I guess it would be  stories about Religious events and festivals
Every village has them every year (except this one thanks to covid) where people meet drink and enjoy fireworks and festival type activities
Wede have like one a week starting from May, so the news gets a bit repetitive :)
We actually have English as an official language thanks to being colonized, one of the two in the EU now :p maybe I’m just a bit dense and didn’t understand the question well haha
And funnily enough pretty much half my cousins are now married to foreigners
And plenty plan to live here, I think it’s the weather and laid back yet family oriented attitude :) if you ever visit (after covid haha) hmu and I’ll try show you around
I’m glad
Hmm, worst weather wise would be around this time of the year, as you would risk having a few rainy days and sea would be cold
I’d say beginning to Mid June would be great
Would be around 25-29 degrees and sea would start getting warm
Sunny every day, festivals would be starting (although arguably the best would be the Zabbar festa in September, lots of drinking) clubs bars would be all open, historical sites might have discounts for beginning of summer and so on :)
See you soon buddy

Malta has a very rich history
1565, seeing possibly the greatest and most important siege of all time
Can I die
Like can I be killed
Or can I just roam around like a phantom
If so 1565 during the Great Siege :) OR when 1798 when we locked the French in our on capital city and laid siege to it
Never, the closest we get is to window shattering hail
We use commas to seperate thousands and a point to seperate the decimal
That's one of the things *~~forcefully~~* given to us by the UK, alongside left-hand driving and other things
This seems so strange
It’s like the British and mainland Europe just always wanted to do things differently
Atheism is becoming more common by the younger generations, but it's still kinda frowned upon and it's better if you keep it to yourself
Malta's population is still quite conservative and deeply into Catholic Christianity
Extremely uncommon, all normal constables are unarmed, unless they are going in to do an arrest, then they are allowed to carry a pistol
But the rapid intensive unit (tough quick guys) are armed and have shotguns and smgs in the car
The detective plain clothes unit is also allowed to keep weapons on them
Any police that have had threats against their life or family can also gain permission to carry a weapon
I would expect it’s because of the rise in terrorist attacks due to ISIS in the last 5ish years
Ah ok
Similarly to the RIU division in Malta
Big overhaul meant more spending on equipment
We just had a large spike in cases due to a party in a hotel, as mass gatherings are allowed, one asymptotic case has given it to 17 others till now, with 16 more discovered
We were close to 0 active cases a week ago
Quite worried for students when they go back to school

Really depends on the situation, if they live with their parents, if they are educated + get a job in the field they are looking for etc
Lately the introduction of a lot of gambling companies that pay much more then the norm has skewed the average salaries
A junior trader would earn 30k plus while the average wage is 19k, then accountants would also earn much more (but that job island numbingly boring so that’s acceptable)
I work in the finance industry and am not technically specified in anything and I earn the average
I live with my parents and with the way covid has stopped any aspect of socializing my savings have gone up, I’d say 70% is saved
The norm would be 40-50% a month
If i would have to take rent and general expenses into account this would plummet, maybe just 10%.
City planning, just actual laws and guidelines for how buildings should be built in a way that it keeps the village/city looking good, no random 10 story apartment buildings that ruin the waterfront and skyline
I would propose Ma il cielo è sempre più blu

Most villages have Patron Saint day feasts where local band clubs will lead a parade, one of the best, 'in my opinion' , is the Haz-Zabbar one, where the two opposing clubs, green and blue, meet, separated by barriers and police, and shout and sing obscene songs about each other
Fight use to be quite common but when a couple people got grievously hurt, it was banned for a few years to let people learn the lesson and cool of, which has worked  apparently
That and we love our fireworks
Welp
Nothing abnormal really, just your regular shady deals and tax evasion
Only difference is that this time, the opposition party is too busy self-destructing over minor issues leaving the government virtually free to do whatever it wants
Well, they were invading the island, and had been periodically attacking the island for the past few decades, looting, burning and enslaving the population of any village they came across on the way
Also the Maltese were outnumbered significantly, with about 2000 professional soldiers, 3000 Maltese "volunteers" and a further 3000 strong informal civilian militia against 40,000 various ottoman troops
So fear tactics were heavily used to compensate to the point where we started firing the heads of enemy soldiers out of cannons at them
We would keep drinking till 4, then go to a village called Rabat, there’s a classic Maltese pastizzeria that sells pies and tea and most importantly the best Pastizzi on the island, it use to be for hunters and farmers as it opened very early, but now it’s over run by us drunk idiots that come back from clubs
He has the classic pea and ricotta Pastizzi, but then he makes chicken, and sometimes anchovy ones, which are just amazing
A dozen pastizzi
You'll find someone open at any time
We have 2, please advise which
'H' as is is silent ( with some exceptions)
Something else the Maltese got from Italian
We have both Acca and the more dry H like for Home or House, mainly for more Semitic words
My country has around 4000 years of recorded history and prehistory going back 7000 years
When learning our country's history, it is usually divided into periods with quite clear demarcation lines
This makes it easier to remember things
At school we do not go into that much detail as it is impossible given the time available and the amount of detail involved
Some students continue to study history at University but they specialise in one period or other
Degrees in Archeology are also offered as there are still things which are occasionally discovered accidentally during construction works and they must be studied carefully
One of the sites which was discovered by accident in 1902 is now a World Heritage site and one of the best preserved and oldest underground temples in the world, going back over 5000 years
Haha, reminds me of my history lessons about Malta
The last 'pillagers' were the Brits
But in Ireland you have some beautiful prehistoric sites, like Newsgrange
I visited it, but our Sun temples are slightly older than Newsgrange :-)
17/18 if you finish A levels on time, some people take 3 years, some try finish all subjects in one year
(not sure if this is still an available option)
Then usually 4 years in university
We have trade schools you can go straight to instead of A levels, is advanced trade schools after A levels
> It's København in Danish - you can't pronounce it, don't worry about it,

"Köbhnhauen" ?

I mean, the 'o' sound in "Oh dear
" is pretty close, not perfect though I'll give you that
Edit: Nope, I'm dead wrong
Back to my hole
There's only one proper university, the University of Malta, so there's your question answered
We have the qassata, which is traditionally filled with [ricotta] with [peas] or with [spinach and anchovies] We also have pastizzi, which are also filled with either [ricotta] or [peas]
that sounds like a pretty good 1-move-ahead strategy game for kids

For us I think it would be the Great Siege of 1565
Highly outnumbered Knights who fought off a ottomans
Ah wait, you said city not nation
It did occur in various cities
If that counts
Just respect the norms and values and don’t make fun of places of significance, historical monuments or the country’s flag
The word for "slug" in Maltese is "bugħarwien". Għarwien means naked
I don't know what bu means though
Snail is bebbuxu
Well, there is a place called Bubaqra
Baqra is a cow
There is an animal of some sort called bużaqq
Żaqq is belly
Maybe the bu is connected to snails but I think it is a prefix
Maybe from Arabic
I don't know
Not at all surprised
In my country, there isn’t really a region which is hated (probably because we are such a small country) but I would probably say that but as for a region which is generally liked, I would probably have to go with Imdina
It used the be the island’s capital back in the Middle Ages and everyone can appreciate the architecture and just overall feel of the city
Same in Malta
In the early months after first opening, [there would be stampedes whenever a bargain would pop up]
Malta is a tiny EU nation but it mentioned in the Bible here: Acts 28:
Acts 28 New International Version (NIV)
Paul Ashore on Malta
28 Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta
2 The islanders showed us unusual kindness
This places the existence of Malta as a country to at least 60CE - i.e. 2000 years ago
Malta was first inhabited in around 5900 BC, but it's proper independence from the British Empire came at around 1964
So Scotland isn't a country
No we are not like Mykonos in Greece
We were always a distinct nation
Just because we were ruled by some other empire does not make us not a nation
We had our own currency, we have our own language (which is now one of the official languages of the EU)
Our language is unique in the world because it is the only Semitic language, written using the Roman alphabet
Our national flag goes back to at least 1000 years in time
Malta has the oldest free standing temples in the world - we are a very distinct country
Exactly
Well, people can literally buy our citizenship if they have enough money
I essentially think that they're whoring out our citizenship
one hour/one and a half hour in traffic to there and back
on an island the size of a pea
What is a strange fact about your country's history
Malta for example has had 11 forigen rulers in the last 2000 years
Haha, I think a better example  would be how the entire population was enslaved by the Arabs at a point, and the islands were left uninhabited for about 170 years until it was repopulated by Arabs from Sicily
Well i guess you really can accomplish anything if you put your mind to it
Truly, the feat of gods
I love the idea of a polish colony
I tried a [Mont Blanc] for the first time ever in paris a few years ago
I have never experienced a purer form of happiness until that moment
hey
Likewise :D
I noticed that some of the actual citizens (read: the north) were not having their passports renewed so readily
relocating in droves to Germany, you say
Nice interactive breakdown here:
Yep, so you need to go to the Greek side to have a baby with any hope of a passport, how messed up is that
Glad to see Şener bey leading the unions to take it to court
Interesting, I had heard different
(and sorry, you're right
I didn't meant assign strict cultural labels like that, I meant  'the south' but was just using the terms I'm familiar with
I didn't think of the associated division it invokes)
That is certainly interesting
anecdotally I know of two T/C + T couples who had their children born on the south side to give their children cypriot passports
From what you are saying, these children would still have no claim to citizenship, unless overruled by the CoM
My guess would then be that the CoM are quite commonly not above bribes or old neighbourly favours ;-)
I find it funny that a child born from a T/C + T couple in Turkey *does* appear to be able to get Cypriot citizenship if one of the parent's is a Cypriot:
> Article 7
> (1) A  child  born to a married Turkish  father  or  mother,  whether  in  Turkey  or abroad, is Turkish citizen
> (2) A child born to a Turkish mother and a foreign father out of wedlock is Turkish citizen
> (3) A child born of a Turkish father and a foreign mother out of wedlock acquires Turkish citizenship if the principles and procedures regarding the determination ofdescent are met
> Place of Birth Article  8
> (1) **A  child  born  in  Turkey,  but  acquiring  no  citizenship  from  his/her foreign mother or foreign father acquires Turkish citizenship by birth
So as long as the father doesn't declare himself as Turkish, I think the child could get a Cypriot passport

Abortion is a huge no no in my country
Even bringing up the topic will probably get you into a huge argument
In fact we are the only European country where it is still completely illegal even if the mother's life is in danger, which is just barbaric
> homosexual acceptancy graphcs
That's pretty much the only thing that makes us 'progressive'. In reality we're very conservative
The LGBT community is still persecuted in the streets especially transgender individuals so make of that what you will
In other areas we're not progressive at all, we've only recently voted for the right to divorce in a referendum (2011), made cremations (2019) and the morning after pill legal (2016)
Abortion, prostitution (paying for sex is legal only) and euthanasia are still punishable
Our conservative nature stems from our deep Christian roots and values
We have similar but with different scope
Standard black on white
Red lettering on white background is for weekend only vehicles
White on black background for vintage 30+ vehicles

It’s so interesting to see some1 from such a micro state here and to get their view, like Malta is considered tiny, then there are you guys
I understand buddy
At least you aren’t in the news for corruption every other week :)
Please, compared to Malta you guys are amateurs :p make way for some very funky Chinese and Russian millionaires that supposedly live in Malta and have our citizenship
I’m not sure which is worse
What do you think can be done for the continuation of the existence of your country
I would think it’s very difficult to keep a ‘nationality’ when you are barely 35k people
We’ve actually been quite a bit since the whole Panama Papers thing, had a few big arrests lately
One from the many we have  in Malta is the "Belliegħa" (Swolower)
Basically it's a monster that lives in the bottom of wells and if you look down into the well for too long it would swolow you
It was told to children to scare them from looking down into wells to prevent them from falling in
That we all have offshore accounts and launder money
It's just the government and the rich people that do that
Most regular people just drink alcohol and take drugs, leaving us with virtually no money to put in offshore accounts
The first time I was in England I was amazed to see people walking their dog in the rain
In Malta it rarely rains (that creates problems for us) so when it does rain we do everything possible to stay dry
Temperatures here are now touching the low 20s and I have changed to wearing Summer clothes
The temperature is very comfortable now but it is already too hot to be in the sun

Most definitely and the Mediterranean will experience devastating droughts more often as well, yay us
Same, I remember walking down 8th Avenue and seeing these insanely tall buildings in the distance and thinking "these look like videogame graphics" because of how 2D and impossible they looked
They became much more 3D as we got closer

I think swearing is technically punishable by a fine
IF they know about us, usually they ask if what they hear in the news is true, corruption, a few car bombings etc, which unfortunately are true haha but still, having to explain it every time round your moral a bit
Small huh ?
7th most densely populated country in the world I think :)) (top ten anyway)
Malta has the second oldest free standing temples in the world, their older than the pyramids
>We are a relatively small country
Hahaha
I once encountered someone who warned a guy criticising the Maltese government to make sure he was using a VPN so the Maltese authorities wouldn't notice
Battleship
I think you're overestimating the power of the Maltese navy
Our fleet consists solely of small patrol boats and RHIBs armed with anywhere from 1-3 mounted machine guns (and one with a single bofors gun donated by Ireland)
Are you kidding
We're the fortress island, we were literally built to take on old-timey galleons (and early 20th century warships)
We've got 21 forts, 8 fortified redoubts, 8 heavily fortified cities, 42 defensive watchtowers, 29 armoured batteries, 2 fortified lines spanning the island and countless civil defence batteries left over from WW2
All we need to do is re-arm them all
The Nazis didn't even manage to take Malta, I'm sure we can handle another Great Siege
That’s one hell of a Netflix documentary in the making
Every 6 to 9 months here
Really depends on the person I think
Depends where they're from most of the time
Americans, Canadians, Australians and especially Brits (still feels strange to class them as non-EU) are definitely welcomed more by the public
But sadly, people from Africa, Middle Eastern countries, India and southeastern Asian countries are not as welcomed and definitely suffer more prejudice (especially when applying for work)
I remember I worked as a waiter and whenever a CV from a Middle Eastern person came in (or anyone with a traditionally Muslim name), my boss would throw it away almost instantly
Unfortunately, most of these people end up working bad jobs such as cleaners, garbage men etc
Although, a lot of people (especially women) from India and other Southeastern Asian countries do find jobs in hospitals as nurses
Most of the general public don't really care what someone's nationality is, but for some reason, many will still be hesitant to initiate conversation with someone from those countries I mentioned
Nope, we got it as a day extra on our vacation leave total
The current ongoing court case of the assassination of DCG
Yesterday one of the murderers plead guilty to be given a presidential pardon for another crime, and to have a reduced sentence of 15 years
(For more info about the case)
Hey
E it’s kindof ‘overlooked’ if that makes sense
The hitmen have been caught for a very long time so it was merely just the court process, what most of the population is waiting for is the case of Yorgen Fenech to be finished to see what the outcome of that is (he’s rumored to be the mastermind, but people expected either Kieth Schembri, or Joseph Muscat, the ex head of staff and ex prime minister for the past government to have been arrested by now, but no concrete evidence has been found for either of them) so really we are all just going on with our lives waiting
You have to understand that Malta is EXTREMELY political, as she was indeed a good journalist in the last couple years, for some reason she was also a blogger that pretty much gossiped and lied about ALOT of political figures, and that made her extremely hated
Her murder was unprecedented, but not to surprising
The only way for money laundering and corruption to stop, is for a completely independent police force to be appointed
Which is pretty difficult in a country of 450 thousand people
Selling of passports was decently legal no
Just yea a company used was laundering money but I think that was after her death
Honestly, depends which person you talk to, Labour supporters would not care about her legacy, hardcore supporters would be happy she’s dead
Nationalist supporters would consider her a legendary journalist that tried to bring down a corrupt government named died doing it
I would say the way the new commissioner was elected ( through a vote in parliament) is probably  the cleanest our police has been in awhile
Very true :) granted she went hard against the ex ‘new’ head of the PN before she was murdered, but correct she was considered part of the ‘old guard’ of the nationalist party
Yes Adrian Delia was the ex leader, the leaders of parties are elected by official members of the party, the tesarati in Maltese, so yes indeed there are a lot votes for favours in the inner circle of both parties unfortunately
Honestly the major change was the election of the new commissioner who is quite a hard ass, and might clear up the economic crime problem we have, or really he has to or we get black listed by Moneyval
Abela, in my eyes, is a narcissistic child in a mans body, but what can you do
Very welcome :) ask anything anytime, of course understand I’m only one person so my views could also be skewed
this is a fun video comparing Maltese and Tunisian, maybe you would enjoy it
No honestly our cases are skyrocketing, enforcement is non existent and I feel like the government is waiting it out hoping the vaccine roll out (which is doing pretty well) will slow down the rise in cases

People making fun of the Italian military always pissed me off
I get that we didn't do well in a few wars but people need to understand that the average Italian soldier was not a coward
It was definitely a case of "great soldiers but bad officers".
It is quite offensive to those that have fought
We are in Africa
We didn't have Nazis, we had Mussolini sympathisers
A group (including a future Prime Minister) were deported to Uganda and a wartime spy named Carmelo Borg Pisani (who was helping the Fascists plan to invade Malta) was hanged
Can I count fortresses and chateaus
Then quite a few :)
And unite it with its other 5 sisters
We have a Christmas charity 24 hour program :) where shows etc are out on for prosper to donate, donations can be given the week before too, like I had gotten a tattoo that the payment for it had gone to this charity a couple years ago
Huge problems with stray/feral cats
They reproduce so damn fast
We have a whole street full, we can afford it so my mother feeds them, and when we can, we catch them and neuter
But all it takes is one female that we missed (street is kinda big and there is a large empty plot behind us that is full of trees and bushes so they can hide there and come out only to eat) that gives birth to another 4-6 every spring
Sometimes we are able to find homes for them :) we have around 3 that stay inside and 3 that live in the garden
Strangely we also get old ones who find our house (maybe because of the smell of the food
) and enjoy their last few weeks alive just sleeping on the couch and eating
We also had a chicken dumped on our doorstep (or somehow it escaped a truck or something), it was tiny and adorable
In general the whole country has a problem I think, and I would love if the environment ministry does something about it, for the cats themselves and for their aggressive invasive attitude to nature, they really love killing all the lizards/reptiles and birds in an area sadly
cheese and chicken

Somehow Greek is quite rare here, sushi has made a big hit the past few years, but sometimes it’s abit too cheap to trust
If you mean local food, I would try find some small eateries, maybe band clubs of a village, or even a political club, doesnt matter of whom they usually cook the same food
Rabbit (fenkata), snails (bebbux), ftira (our bread), pastizzi
(ricotta or pea filled pastries), local goat cheese (gbejna) and sausage
plus some bigilla (bean dip) and local galletti(crackers), im getting hungry
this website pretty much has everything

You all seem to forget about the islands which are not directly connected to the European mainland
Until and if they ever make a train from all EU islands such as for instance, from Malta to Italy, then this idea would be unfair as it doesn't take all member states into consideration
I don't think it's worsened, it's always been this bad bit now we can just see it more

Malta has more cranes than trees

You would never find those type of window details in modernism since the modernists' philosophy was a rejection of the very same intricate ornamental and floral styles that defined Art Nouveau and the later Art Deco (think of works by Frank Llloyd Wright, Le Corbusier and Mies Van Der Rohe for instance)
The 500 Euro note is closer towards representing the Modernist style, although it seems to depict contemporary architecture in general (not just Modernism, which refers to the specific style especially dominant until the 1980s, but a mix of styles popular in the present day)
Edit: In between Modernism and contemporary architecture we also had the rise and fall of Post-Modernist architecture during the 80s and early 90s, but this isn't represented on the banknotes
Ehh if you beleive these clowns over experts you kinda deserve it
I do feel sorry for those who don't but are being dragged along with the populous majority
You do realize we have just as much drills in metric right
This has nothing to do with measurements
That’s a moltres
Not a single van parked on the sidewalk
Fun fact: We would have been Italian today if Napoleon didn't invade
Since we were part of the two Sicilies (technically), I would assume the next step would be the Kingdom of Italy
But the French annoyed us so much, that we begged the Brits to come help us
We also begged the Brits to stay, and that changed the course of history
Italian is still very present today here though
I estimate over 80% know Italian today
Its a very common mistake, I wouldn't call it ignorance :)
To be fair, Maltese has a lot of Italian in it (mostly Siculu-Arabicu), so you were not totally wrong
Sorry
Its our guilty pleasure :)

I'm Maltese and I don't even know how to write in malti, it's a tough Language
Meanwhile, we're not when on the map
In Malta we say Chinese as well, since we were not included
Someone please ride on the roofs of the cars
Because it is the correct and older way to spell it
See commented bellow who delves into details
>The standard pictures are chosen when a country joins EU, and are to my knowledge unchangeable
The exception to this rule is when a country has its monarch on their coins (such as kings, queens or the Pope)
They can change it if this person dies and a new head of state is appointed
We've had three different Popes since the start of euro, and other countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands also changed their king/queen
In all cases, the respective country issued new coins
I see, we can change ours in only 2 more years then :)
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Love living in Malta wow so amazing
You know Malta is mostly fossil fuels coz of Nationalists, now with a new government we have renewable
It's true, we have fallen back on our energy targets, and we need to invest a lot more in alternative energy, but your idea for Comino is a non-starter
Don't mistake its "rocky desert island" appearance with minimal capacity for life; Most of the island is actually a bird sanctuary and a protected shrubland nature reserve
It contains native vegetation, and Birdlife International classifies it as an Important Bird Area because of the Shearwaters that breed there
There have recently been some afforestation projects, and camping has been heavily restricted by the environment authority
Solar panels and especially wind farms would ruin this aspect
But yeah I agree, we need more solar panels in our country
In my home town they are implementing a communal solar farm project [on the roof of a large water reservoir] and the project is being [extended to the other ~20 reservoirs on the island] It's not enough, but it is a good start
They also subsidise the installation costs of panels on private/residential rooftops, but the takeup of this scheme has slowed down recently
In my opinion we should have a law that every new building must have some solar panels on its roof
Plus more electric cars - they are perfect for our country, but very few people have one
Fuckin pastizzi
[Chuckles in Maltese]
Laughs in Maltese
Leaving out Malta entirely
Subtle
Well done
Well you've definitely insulted me
Where the fuck is malta
Same for Malta
Well at least Denmark (not in this case though) as a geographical feature actually appears
Just looking up maps of the Mediterranean a good chunk of them act like there's nothing but sea where Malta should be :(
Edit: Ironically enough, when I typed in "Maps without
" in Google, the first result to come up was Maps without Denmark
I see you have a point
What a waste of money lmao to waste on such a broken country
I want Tingynus ( or how its spelt) now
It tasted amazing
Aw man ! I wanted Sakotis badly (It is spelt Xakotis right
The girl I was visiting said it was a traditional thing, but I only had a small hand luggage with me and I couldn't take it back home
I left a part of my heart in Lithuania
some day I will return
Sorry I meant pronounced, not spellt
X in my language = sh so you are spot on
Reminds me of state TV in Malta after MEPs accused Malta of being a tax haven
Just to clarify, a *lot* of evidence is pointing towards a wealthy businessman who wanted her dead before she published an article on his uncle
He had some ties with government officials currently incriminated but most have resigned since and there has been a change in administration
I'm not totally in favour of nor defending the current administration either, mostly full of incompetent shady politicians
But I feel it's quite a claim to say "the government killed her" when it's very obvious the mastermind was this businessman
This thread is a cesspool
No stats for Malta
Where is Malta
Fidget spinners
Because Home Depot was closed that day
Guessing we're yellow
Not a fan of abortions, but in this case I'd say put it to a referendum be done with it
No one googles us :(
I'll take it
Vielen Dank, Herr
I come from a Mediterranean country that gets tourists from all over Europe
The older German tourists always look like they're going to go for a hike
But
we were part of the Roman Empire too
They also have a monument to an SS division in the middle of the capital square
Wasn't it used by Waffen SS Estonia division
So making a monument with insignia once worn by nazi division that committed atrocities is fine
I don't understand that logic sorry
Could have used a bunch of other symbols
Don't you have a swallow as a national bird
Could have used that or some shit
We need Malta next
Melting in 15 degrees
I know I am not a big fan of hot days, but damn you guys take it to another level
I mean a lab coat is close enough
Malta is not a microstate fuck off
Malta is a microstate
Lol we have multiple accents in Malta
I'm seeing words like Pivo, Gervosa and Sör, and for some reason seeing Leann casually there killed me
Is this parks and recreation
Yeah we might be doing bad stuff
but what about all those guys lunching negroes
Holy shit it's been more than 8 seconds
What a record
Can we get 12 hours
To be honest I am relieved that a second referendum will not be done
The UK threw up a tantrum about the EU even though they had a favourable position and now because things are not going their way they get an option to renegotiate and cancel
I don't think that's very nice and sets a dangerous precedent for all the countries currently in the EU
Means he has a bad tax lawyer
Is that Myrinne's house
I can't help but begrudgingly think that Trumps refusal to the Paris agreement was actually a good thing since it ended up strengthening other peoples resolve with regard to this issue
Malta enters the game
Your prime minister looks like Stephen Colbert
18°C and sunny all week, life is good in Malta
Yesterday was most definitely not sunny
Just checked
Nope, cannot find any there either
We'll have to get some from the EU as usual I guess
We have enough bus stops
Nah thats us, Sicily on the left and the tip of Italy on the right
Noticed there wasn't one for Malta so here's one that *really* pisses us off
"So are you guys Arabs or Italians
But how do you make a Maltese cross
You don't include them in a map of Europe
I love the Malta one
Exactly
This is a doctor we are talking about
Having women patients to examine should have way more physical contact than a handshake and is simply required if you are to be able to diagnose ailments properly
if he refused a handshake then that means he would refuse to touch women in practice as well which makes him a bad doctor
I mean all you have to do is use sanitizer after or before or both times and you'd still be safe from handshakes
This isn't about rules it's about principles
I cant wait when they will start funneling money through Malta
Will keep my job going
Reducing one's tax liability legally is not evil
We will rather die then close our tax system
Another jelous eurpean who cant handle oit economic success
Wait, where's Malta
I am interested in knowing
Not enough yellow in the world
I wounder who would win, Malta or Poland
Good

Imagine it being so small, no one bothers
We’re like the old Italian Lira of measurement
1 Belgium is 97 Maltas, 1 Germany is 1131 Maltas and an Australia - 24341 Maltas
Can confirm
We don't swear żobb ġoxx il-liba ommok
Maltese people are saints that never curse
According to this Malta also doesn't swear
Which is weird as many Maltese are talented in naming every Saint in the Bible when swearing
Lol heatwave
9 actually feels nice and cool compared to the rest of summer
Malta is next on the list
Great job malta
Malta is red towards everything
Oh boy
Wow, is Malta serously all red in these
Im ashamed D:
It seems to me that the E.U is now hell bent to break up
and I'm not even the eurosceptic kind
end of line
Abandoning the peg and allow for devaluation of local currency more like it
Is this a genuine reply or a troll
I can't figure out
How can devaluing a currency help the crisis in any way
Normal summer for us
Nothing new
Da xkin ftakru fmalta
Happy to be included
I applaud you for adding Malta
Shit log LMAO
WHO WAS AGAINST
Who are the 225 cunts
And yet my country isnt involved
I remember having a couple of their comic books in English
They were relatively known in Malta
If something is awesome then it will be spread elsewhere, being translated into other languages eventually
Oh these, I didn't have many of their comic book as a kid but I remember growing through them multiple times to find more & more references & commentary hidden in their stories
Good times
I remember they made a live action movie starring Roberto Benigni
Kinda how like France has a place called Nice, so it's really weird reading tragic stories based there
[Here you go]
Huh
We fought a war
As a Maltese person, I appreciate this very much
No more pastizzi for you

EYYY MALTA IS FINALLY INCLUDED IN SOMETHING
AND ITS THE COOLEST THING POSSIBLE
Good job bro
You know a map is accurate when op remembers Malta exists
Yikes, can't say you're wrong
I was about to point and laugh
then Google informed me that the highest point in Malta is only 253 meters
Oh well, we still beat the Danish
Lol cute
Also, if you ever see tourists speaking what sounds like a mixture of Arabic, Italian and English, they're probably Maltese
And they're probably trash talking you
I'll take that as a yes
Fun fact, lumi means lemons in Maltese
Liba
It is also used to greet close buddies
"Awww libaaa" :D
Liba
Lumi means lemons in ours xD
Yes, confirmed :)
Which coincidentally means duck in Hungarian
Had a great chuckle in a Hungarian supermarket when I saw tubs of white duck fat with Liba written on them
Never heard anyone using that
Maybe it's a local thing
I heard qalbi
Oh god
Its a vulgar thing
Like Hello cunt /Hello asshole
Qalbi is a sweet embracing , on the other hand
(Qalbi literally means heart, btw)
I know it means heart
I just havent heard the other one
It's a very vulgar word so don't go saying it to anyone pretty much
It's usually used as an insult, like how you would use the word dick
For the supposed economic boom that Malta is experiencing, €1021 is not a good place to be in

BONFIRE LIT

BONFIRE KINDLED
In the late 70s and early 80s we were quite close to a ‘civil war’,  with many similar incidents like the link happening over a period of a decade, the hatred between the 2 parties is still very strong today
I approve this message
Thank you for wanting to kill me complete stranger
I would like to choose Austria for some unknown reason
Unfortunately (or fortunately), Malta's total greenhouse gas emissions only add up to around 0

I don't. Especially since I live near the sea

As a Maltese I thank you
That is true
History lessons are boring
Yes I am maltese
I'm watching the documentary now, but not sure that I want to continue watching as it is so sad
More shocking still is that medicine has not been able to offer a solution and has been reduced to helping the patient kill herself
I mean she is in her 20s and physically healthy
I can understand when euthanasia is considered for an elderly person with a terminal illness
I had one relative who spent the last 10 years of her life in bed in constant pain
I was there when she once asked a doctor to give her something to help her end it all
But euthanasia is illegal in my country
What I find scary is that if I am ever in her position I would not be able to get help to end it all so I agree with Euthanasia in such cases
In Switzerland organisations such as EXIT assist with Euthanasia and their model addresses some of the common concerns raised by euthanasia
Yes sometimes I do especially due to the nature of work where we communicate a lot cross country
I'll try to keep communication with natives with mother tongue so I don't forget it
It use to be Valletta, the capital city, was one of the poorest areas in Malta, but has boomed the last 10 years
I’d say maybe now Paceville, the clubbing city, ironically named, full of drunk people, piss and throw up, fun when it needs to be but would be hell to live there
> Copenhagen is gorgeous
Such a gorgeous city

We've experienced the [driest February ever recorded] Well, at least since our Met Office started compiling data in 1923
This is the second winter with basically no rain, [2016] was also a very bad year
Last year, in February, we experienced one of the most intense storm surge with hurricane strength winds
In 50 years time, [my country is going to become unlivable]
We could, I don’t agree with FIFA and the slave labour of Qatar, but it’s not like a team that gets kicked out straight away will have much of a difference
We'll win the world cup this time, have hope
Band clubs closing (happening), no village feasts (groups of over 250 banned, soon to be much less), and no traffic for once
Can't say the same here since Italians like to make their presence known by screaming at you in Italian
Same goes for us i guess
But I think it depends on the generation
I thought Iceland was
from Iceland
Turns out its English
Apart from free healthcare for its citizens, every EU country has an agreement with other EU countries so that if the national of one country is abroad and something happens they get free healthcare in the foreign country too
One question for people from the USA: You pay some social security, right
How much does it cost and what does it cover
I am in Europe and most healthcare is publicly funded
State hospitals are the best and they are where you go for something really serious
For example when I had an accident I just called the emergency number, an ambulance came, I was taken to the ER, medicated, x-rays, and given an appointment for meeting with a consultant
There are no bills
If you need medicines while you are in hospital they are free
If you are not in hospital you usually pay for medicines, unless you have a chronic condition
So a one off medicine like an antibiotic is something that you buy from a pharmacy, but if you have something chronic like diabetes, hypertension, etc
, you get free medicine
General practitioners are also provided by the state but most people prefer to go to a private GP as the cost is low and it is not something frequent
We pay around 10% of what we earn for national insurance
This covers all health issues and our pension
We can also pay an extra private insurance for private medical care
The advantage to private care is that waiting lists are shorter but for really serious things like let's say by pass surgery, it is something always carried out in state hospitals
jelenecek - I am not sure that I understand all your figures, mainly because you sometimes use a comma ( , ) and at other times a fullstop ( .) between numbers
So when you say that a visit to a GP costs  € 7,26 do you mean 7 euros and 26 cents
If that is the case it is very similar to what we pay in Malta
GPs charge anything from 5 to 15 Euros depending on things like the place where they are located and how in demand they are
It is generally considered a very reasonable charge especially since most people only need to see a GP once or twice a year
Not really, unless you have a filter which is pretty costly, government water smells and tastes abit of chlorine so it’s not the best
But a lot of houses have wells where they buy water from the water table
(From government regulated suppliers)
Very similar to Malta, it’s out of respect I guess, take an hour leave out on a suit and go back to work after
Maybe also a Catholic thing
We have this with villages here in Malta, and we are tiny
Yet local patriotism is still a thing, I would guess it’s human nature to be proud of the community you are brought up in
Has happened here too
As we are so tiny plenty of villages have merged, but they kept they’re names, you can just step into one village and on the other side of the street it’s another
Do people actually play rugby
Since we don’t have any mountains I’d say no :p but if you go walking early mornings you will have a few people who would say hello or good morning, other than that we don’t.

I was in Barcelona and I rented a tricycle to go around as I cannot ride bikes
I ended up going through the Ramblas, even though I was later told that I shouldn't have
but anyway
On the Ramblas, I heard a guy talking in Maltese and I stopped cycling
Having not heard Maltese in a while, I was surprised
When I got to continue cycling, I hit the Maltese man with the tricycle and he was in the middle of a Maltese swear phrase when I told him that I am sorry in Maltese
He then told me that it's ok
As a Maltese, knowing what swear phrase that person must have used makes this a million times funnier
Yes indeed
I'm a girl
He used a nice haqq al and stopped there, thankfully :D
What do you mean
In Maltese it also means something similar like in Arabic, however haqq in Maltese is the beginning of a swear phrase
Cannot explain well
My Italy-obsessed dad loves Calabria because it's beautiful
Fuck the Mafia man, Italy would be almost perfect if it weren't for those parasites
Erm, yes that too
Well we joke about defences and not being conquered, since we were always amidst battles and cross continents hehe
the school system
i just don't understand it because the one we have is completely different
thank you
Hey
Well, coronavirus cases are rising, we have like 300 in about 3 weeks (im not sure), everyone is bored and most people are too scared to leave their houses so i guess it isn't the best here :')
Nope, not for now
Thank you, same to you
Below 10 in winter, Summer is a wasteland here so anything below 30 is a Godsend
“Maltese, like the dog
“You’re from Malta
so you’re Italian
Close to 0 here in Malta, as it’s illegal last time I checked
0% here, it's technically illegal
Same with Malta, but with a loooot more swearing
A Maltese person that hates pastizzi
Thank you Italy for the food and caffè.
Thank you Spain for siesta
Thank you Britain for the afternoon tea
Thank you Greece and Turkey for sweets
Thank you all Europeans for keeping us afloat and being where we are now and sorry for ripping off everyone's delicacies and making our own version
Thank you Italy and Germany for [bombing] [the] [hell] out of us during WW2 and showing the world how truly resilient my country & forefathers were
Gozo
Sister island :)
Exactly the same in Malta
Fun to go for a few days, with a desert trip and a trip to the mosque in abu dabi, and maybe a water park
That’s it really
'Become' in English is a stative verb but in German  'bekommen' means 'to get'. I was confused for a while when I heard a German ask a bartender 'Can I become a coffee, please
Pretty much exactly like us
( except the drive to the alps part haha) but we have a ferry to Sicily so that’s an ‘easy’ escape
Still wouldn’t mind to live and work in different countries, travel abit and experience various cultures
Cannot say it was popular but it was fairly common
My father had one and as you said quite roomy and felt adventurous everytime i rode in it
And yes there were the ricers as well
Decently popular
At least you could have seen a few at that time, when we were snuggling up to the USSR states
This, I remember being afraid to keep the light on in the bathroom because otherwise I would be showering with the moths next morning
Have not seen ones so big in a long long time
We're quite Catholic and I've never seen anything like this in my life
Italian :) maybe Arab if written with Latin characters
I've heard that Tunisian people can understand malti pretty well
Pastizzi - a savoury pastry traditionally filled with peas or ricotta
They look like vulvas and in fact pastizz is slang for vulva
Pastizzi, which pretty much are savory pastries filled with either pea filling or cheese filling
They're delicious
Pretty common, lots of houses have flag poles for  various feasts and holidays, so they would a Maltese one handy
Right now you would see quite a few, as we had our first 0 cases since the start of this, people are feeling patriotic
This one where the prime minister is waving goodbye to the last of the British Royal Navy ships as they leave the Grand Harbour
This was the day Malta was no longer used as a British military base
The smaller the country the worse this is I think, Malta is a great example
I would also add the Megalithic Temples here in Malta, potentially the oldest man made structures in existence
We're Mediterranean too
Can understand majority of the paragraph and make a gist
But Spanish for some reason feels very different to me
Lots of people disagree with us including the cross of st
george on the top right, but I don’t mind it
Adds quite abit of history
It was given to us as a action by the King of England after WW2, for our bravery
But some see it as a reminder that we were nothing but a colony and a base for the British for a 100 years
Nooooo not at all
It's very common for kids to stay with their parents for a long time here
And I've never heard of anyone paying rent or helping with bills even if they have a good job
We're 5 kids and my sister moved out less than a year ago at 32
My brother is 30 and doesn't seem to be moving out any time soon
Property is expensive here so most parents try to help their kids until they can have a proper home instead of a cheap room for rent
Now how's about you reciprocate that kindness and show a Maltese around Scotland
Haha
We only have one
It’s quite good, our education system is pretty decent
Malta is the meaning of corruption
Oof
More than we would like to admit
I don't really get involved with politics so i can't go into detail but the past prime minister ruined the country, and  now the new one has to sort out all the shit he did
Elizebeth
Or maybe the grandmasters of the knights would be acceptable
If those parameters are small than I honestly accept the title of micro state now :(
Our hospital took around 12 years to build, granted lately public projects have become more efficient
Our supermarkets are opening at 4am, and toilet paper, pasta and anything with antiseptic properties are pretty much sold out
&#x200B;

anything that's unique but dumb
a name like Lora would get you easily judged
Uhm
Yea trains
won't be a thing here :|
The Italian influence on our food
Love it
Kinnie
A soda made from bitter oranges and the peels, it’s bitter, and abit sweet, but extremely refreshing
Similar to Kinnotto in Italy :)
Was looking for this
Hmmm e have Kinnie in Malta :) pretty much a copy of Chinotto, extremely refreshing
My father lived through Nazi germany, what happened, the atrocities, the power hungry officials are talked about all the time, documentaries and news stories are shown continuously
They do not hide their history, but they try learn from it
We had a string of car bombings in 2015-2017, two drug lord families were fighting to be number one
As long as it was only criminals endangering themselves the police didn’t mind, then we had the assassination of DCG, that had a huge effect on the country, and how we are seen internationally
/sad neighbouring noises  heheeh
Aww, thanks for tea and biscuits i guess
Don't worry, we're used to be forgotten  hehe
But we still love you
Same here in Malta
lesti jew le, arawni gejja
Correction fluid is TippEx, was very confused when a friend had asked for correction liquid once, those cylinders that keep soup and coffee warm are called Thermos, vacuum is Hoover, I’m sure there are plenty more which I cannot remember at the moment
You really gave me a yearning for some Chupa-Chups now
That sounds dirty
Several years ago I crossed from Austria to Hungary several times in just a few days
My passport was checked by the Hungarians
More recently I had to visit Belgium but the most convenient flight landed in the Netherlands
Someone picked me up at the airport and we drove straight to Belgium
There was no checking of passports or ID
Yes - it was in the 1990s.
We have a few new ones which, not to offend, are somewhat ridiculous, Xaznaya, Xenaia, Xachary, pretty much any name they could fit an x(sh) in the front
There use to be a journalist that was a thorn in the government’s side, and to some of the rich
She was assassinated
The Maltese parliament, looks like a cheese grater
Considering Valletta is full of amazing old palaces built by the Knights, this, at the entrance of the city, is just horrible
Yes
There is a religion subject in all schools, which teaches Roman Catholicism
From kindergarten all the way up to the end of secondary school
Constitution of Malta
Article 2
3 "Religious teaching of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Faith shall be provided in all State schools as part of compulsory education
We are currently pissing them off with our immigration policies and lack of anti money laundering policies (although that’s doing mu better now with the new commissioner), we are tiny, neutral, and would not make a single difference to the EU, apart from maybe being potentially a base in the Mediterranean, abandoning our neutrality, and as a sunny destination for a holiday :)
Oi dint forget about the little colony that could :p
Quite a few businesses are planning to come here already, we also have a very favorable corporation tax, as you guys do
Yepp :) it’s a national language, that and Maltese :) id say 60% are fluent in both, and the rest are mainly focused on Maltese, with a good basic understanding of English, that can easily be improved
I would say people taking advantage of it
Going there for practically no reason, wow I stubbed my toe let me go and waste half an hour of a doctors time to check if it’s broken, when it obviously isn’t. But really nothing else I can think of
Maltese is pretty much Arabic mixed with Italian, French and various Latin aspects :)
my school spoils tf out of us, but we start at 7
55 and finish at 13
35 everyday, 8 45 minute class
Sort of side question, is Bastille Day celebrated in the Vendee region
I remember finding a source in secondary school saying that the region didn't celebrate it because of the uprising there, but never did any further research into it
maltese
i'm maltese
yeah, but i still find it difficult to write and stuff
No, the tap water tastes really bad unless you have a filter installed to get rid of the excess particulates
It is both normal to drink and not drink from the tap in Malta
Some town's tastes better than others, thats why
Lol try 2011
Yup
I mean we have a bit of a ways to go as any type of abortion is a criminal act here
A true Maltese classic ; tqiq , meaning flour
It uses the phonetic gutteral Q which mostly exists in arabic based languages so its always a bit funny to watch people try and say it
Siehbi, Habib :) both mean friend, we use the normal causal one you listed above aswell, we have some ‘crude’ ones as well, like Kink, or Ras, which literally means head, or figuratively means head of the penis
(Still a term of endearment though haha)
At one point we also had Sex, as in, the word, as a sign of hello, like ‘Hey Sex’, also slightly crude :p
Well, fireworks celebrate country here
We would find every excuse summer or winter where we can try shoot up fireworks, be it a feast, wedding or some kind of victory celebration haha
We have them every day of the summer
From 8am all day and all night till about 1 am
Yep, they're still everywhere actually
And in Malta they still hold a place which is under their political jurisdiction even though it's within the island
Actually it's st Angelo :)
Well in Malta some people (mostly from the north) will just speak in English to each other
So it would be a group of Maltese people but they'll just speak in English or a Maltese/ English hybrid
Since English is also an official language, it's normal for us to start a convo in English and just keep speaking English or just constantly keep switching  from Maltese to English
I think university
Here, uni is not only free, but you get paid a monthly stipend and a [Maintenance Grant ] at the beginning of the first semester, which varies from ~400 to ~900-1000 (depending on the subject and year, cause in first year you get more)
The grant is also doubled for people who face certain financial difficulties (parents are divorced, they may live alone or if one of their parents passed away)

Welcome to the Mediterranean life
Our obvious one involves the (ongoing) story behind Daphne Caruana Galizia's murder, where there were political links tied to the murder
The government did not collapse per se, but it saw the ruling Labour party's leader and Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, resign
His successor, current Prime Minister Robert Abela, brought about quite a bit of reshuffling, even convincing an MEP to step away from Brussels in his second reshuffle within his first year of premiership
The less obvious collapse of government, and some Maltese people might not agree with me, was the 2013 Budget being rejected in parliament, when a member of the Nationalist party voted together with the Opposition
This, as well as then-Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi's unwillingness to vote in favour of the introduction of divorce in the country (which people approved of as per a referendum), shortened the government's legislature by a few weeks, with the government dissolving prematurely because of loss of confidence
The general election was due anyways, which is why people might not agree on this instance being a collapse of government
English is a first language here (alongside Maltese) so almost everyone under the age of 70 can speak it or has a general understanding of it
It's taught in schools and given the same importance as Maltese (in some schools it's actually preferred, with the students being required to speak in English
) We're also taught a compulsory foreign language in secondary school (one of our choosing), with most people choosing Italian
In fact, when my parents were growing up, they only had Italian and Maltese channels on tv, so most people can understand Italian with more than half of the population probably being fluent
I saw a statistic that said 60% of the population is fluent in Italian but I can't remember where I saw it, but it seems accurate
Some people can also speak French
It's probably the most common after Italian due to its importance in Europe for work
But yea, pretty much the entire country is bilingual, with more than half being trilingual
What I like about Italy is its food
I have never been to any restaurant in Italy and not been happy with the food
Hope you get well soon
All of Mdina
You can't tell me a town from 700BC that has been pillaged countless times doesn't have ghosts
In Maltese the word ' u ' means ' and'. It is probably the most commonly used one ltter word the language
Bilingualism is super common in Malta
We have 2 national languages which are English and Maltese
Maltese is derived from the Semitic, Italian, Spanish, french and English languages
I'd say around 99% of Maltese speak some degree of English, although the large majority are very fluent
It is generally the old people and the poorer section of the population which do not speak English fluently
Both languages are taught simultaneously from kindergarden years
It is also becoming increasingly common that the two languages are mixed together in the same sentence, which I must admit is a bit weird at first, but it sometimes just comes out naturally
You would forget a word in Maltese and you say it in English instead to continue the conversation
Italian is a super common language especially with my generation and older
Italian TV came to Malta before the British TV, so naturally many children used to watch and learn Italian from cartoons
In recent years, the use of Italian has declined due to many English speaking channels and the introduction of French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Russian and Arabic languages in secondary schools
I can understand old Maltese pretty well
The difference mainly is the difference in letters
If there is a cup dangling from that pack and/or a beer bottle strapped somewhere, yep that's one
I challenge you: Cyprus
(though you can actually still easily tell in this generation
The last-last-last generation was more mixed)
Malta -- mainly three:
Generic Maltese:
Literrally no accent noticeable, spoken by about 70% of the entire Maltese population
Rural Maltese:
Spoken by people from more rural, less developed areas of Malta
Mostly prevelent in areas like Mgarr, Żebbuġ, Ħad-Dingli and a lot of localities in Gozo
Spoken by about 5% of the population, mostly old folk
*Pépé*-Maltese:
This is the hybrid Maltese-English dialect, where speakers will switch languages mid-conversation
Mostly frowned upon, however quite popular
Mostly spoken by people from St
Julian's and Sliema, at around 15% of the population
Although we are a tiny island of 400k, there are various dialects, Zurrieq switches alot of a to o, similar to our sister island Gozo, Sliema area speak more English then others, and elongate Maltese words, etc
Valletta has a somewhat specific pronunciation as well, then we have those who emigrated to Australia and Canada in the 70s and came back, having their own dialect
Contrary to the norm of learning foreign languages, I think or as far as I know our language (Maltese) is uniquely learnt in our schools
Doubt it can be easily offered abroad to teach like English or other languages since it is quite difficult to learn
Ye we have this too
It is literally in our Constitution
I’d consider us as kindof a micro state
Come visit when covid calms down, nice beaches and amazing history :D shit politicians though

There's a theory that there's a whole other city under our capital city, I honestly don't know much about them but we do have underground catacombs in more than one place on the island

We were the [most bombed country in the world ] at a point in history after suffering a 2 year siege during WW2 between 1940 and 1942
In total, 15,000 tonnes of bombs were dropped on our archipelago
We also have some of the oldest freestanding temples in the world, the ones at [Ħaġar Qim] older than the pyramids at giza
One of the two countries (now) that have English as a national language

I hve a few aunties and uncles who are old enough to remember being under British rule very vividly, (1967ish it ended here), it was a different time, poverty and class differences ruled, the navy was the largest employer, huge parts of the islands were off limits, history is so interesting and important
I love how many people visit this little rock
Yes Valletta has had huge amounts of investment poured in the last 10 years, and it shows :) some parts of it use to be known as slums here back in the 70s
That's dark

It's a commonwealth thing since we were a colony
But the populace doesn't. And i think nowadays  the population doesn't care
But since it's a national thing, the government does it for that day during the commemorative ceremony and that's it
I think it became more if a commonwealth obligation lol
Everyone who mentioned Italian knows it in Maltese without knowing
In Italian it’s grazie and in Maltese it’s grazzi

We had a man who ran for prime minister, he was kicked out of his home by his wife, lived in a small garage and was genuinely abit crazy, he gathered huge crowds, even though it was more to laugh at his ideas rather then to actually support him

Oops not really no, more like a small town
The ottomans had a false report during the Great Siege, thinking 20000 troops were coming from Spain to reinforce us, in reality it was 2000, barely a force big enough to defend most forts
They retreated, if they had won, it would have been an easy fortified spot to launch attack onto Southern Europe
In Malta temperatures can reach the mid 30s very easily in Summer
If the milk is UHT milk it does not need to be refrigerated until it's opened
Then it is treated like normal milk
You take it out of the fridge for that one short moment when you need some in your coffee then dash it back to the fridge
Some people do not refrigerate eggs if they are going to cook them in a day or two
Some supermarkets do not refrigerate theirs either
But I put mine in the fridge as I am never sure for how long I'll have them
We put chocolate in the fridge in Summer as otherwise it will melt
Maybe depends which restaurant, medium price range family type ones would definitely pack it up for you to take home if you asked
Assassinated a journalist who kept revealing what actually happens in the government
We have three
These are:
1) The capital city [Valletta] constructed by the Knights of Malta and named after the Grandmaster Jean Parisot de Vallette who led Malta to victory against a far larger invading force of Ottoman soldiers
2) The [Megalithic Temples of Malta] a collection of Stone Age temples scattered across the islands, that are among the oldest free-standing structures in the world
Mnajdra temple in particular is astronomically aligned, where the sun shines at the centre of an arch on the spring/autumn equinoxes
3) The [Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum] an underground tomb complex built during the Stone Age
The complex features an oracle room, that causes sounds made inside it to resonate throughout the complex
The Hal Saflieni Hypogeum, an underground structure dating back to 3600 BC, the Megalithic Temples, maybe around 6 total round the island I think
Extremely old structures, considered some of the oldest structures on earth
And the City of Valletta, our Capital City, a fortified city built to defend the Grand Harbor :)
'Europeans' is just a convenient word to lump many different nationalities that live in the same continent
Cultures vary between countries and even within countries
Personally, I avoid clothes with logos on them
Some of us consider wearing clothes with obvious logos as being ostentatious and a sign of 'new money'. I laugh inside when I see someone wearing a polo shirt with a huge Ralph Lauren emblem
Why on Earth would anyone want to pay a lot of money to serve as a walking advertising board
I am no expert when it comes to fashion but take top brands like Chanel: you are never going to see a real and elegant Chanel dress with a visible logo, but sophisticated women can tell that it is Chanel
As a man, I like a British outlet called Marks and Spencer
They have a long history of quality clothes
Their quality has probably fallen a little over the years but when it comes to basic wear I find that they are the best
Shirts come in lots of sizes, with half sizes in between the full sizes and even sleeve lengths are sized
The quality is excellent too but never have I seen anything of theirs with the brand showing
The name is hidden inside on a label
I'm actually quite happy about it
I am not from the UK but from a small EU country which was a colony of the UK
So we ended up with two official languages - one of them being English
Without English huge amounts of important literary and scientific works would not be available to me
In my country we also get a lot of students who come here to study English
They prefer us over the UK because we get 300 days of sunshine each year and beaches are everywhere
This year our economy is going to suffer though :(
But to be clear, English is not the most widely spoken language in the World
Mandarin is the language with the highest number of native speakers
Spanish is second and English comes third
However English is first when it comes to the number of people who can use it to some degree or other as a second language
many ppl know italian in my country
Malta
Eh kinda but it has more arabic
I definitely live closer to Tunisia than Greenland and unfortunately know more about Italian & English culture & customs than Tunisian
I've met a handful of North Africans from Libya, Tunisia and Egypt and they've always been really nice
Would love to visit any North African country (even Libya when the trouble there subsides)
Peak of the St John Knight period :) the ship aspect of AC has been hugely successful so this would be perfect, tiny medieval island full of forts and villages and old cities, religion, politics, with continuous Mediterranean Sea missions, pirates, trade, outposts in the rest of Europe and North Africa, maybe even a crusade
It can end with the great siege of Malta, would be fantastic
Honestly the trilogy of Ezio was amazing, 3 had a good setting but story was abit wonky, but introduced ship battles, 4 was pretty much pirates of the Caribbean, decent, since then I haven’t bought a new one, but would like to try the new rpg element of combat they’ve introduced
In Italy the traditional film for Christmas is Trading Places
In Malta, I don't know

Hahaha fuck that hit deep
In Malta everyone learns Maltese and English compulsory and then a third language can be chosen
It works pretty well, over 90% of the population is Bi-Lingual
Really
When did you come
Oh ok
Not separatist but the two political parties are at each other’s throats so much (and are so loyal to the party) that it feels like they are two movements that want to control the country
Honestly my city, mainly cause the majority of my friends are from the same city, or from the south of Malta, so we all enjoy picking at eachothers cities stereotypes etc
I don’t feel much national pride or identity when it comes to being Maltese tbh
I am Maltese, then European, then my town
Being from a small country changes the way you identify yourself
Playing caps and slammers, collecting Pokemon and Harry Potter stickers
I just say I’m sorry for your loss tbh
Always love this photo
You can feel the tension of the war through the screen
**Disadvantages**: Property prices are **SUPER** inflated meaning young adults are not able to move out from their parents house until they are about 30-35 years old because you need *at least* €10,000 to €15,000 as a deposit for a dinky apartment in a hideous area with 1 bedroom and no natural light
Land is super scarce so property prices are inflated to hell
Many people know each other or other families (especially in Gozo) so, while this leads to a sense of comradery, it also breeds conservatism for fear of being judged
Employment options are limited especially when it comes to science and research (specifically in Malta)
**Advantages**: Malta is one of the safest places in the world partly, I believe, because it's a microstate
I should move abroad
>and the lack of good public transport
Can confirm, 3 buses didn't show up today
Don't think Maltese would classify as beautifully sound
"Socialism is radical communism"
"Marxism is radical capitalism"
"Capitalism and communism are the same thing"
After I challenged them on it, they told me to "prove it".

Ignoring the obvious daily report on Covid, we had the ongoing court case for the murder and assassination of Daphne Caruana Galazia, a journalist who was killed a couple years ago
As they have found the suspected man behind the murder
Ow sorry I misunderstood the question then
Hmmm I guess it would be  stories about Religious events and festivals
Every village has them every year (except this one thanks to covid) where people meet drink and enjoy fireworks and festival type activities
Wede have like one a week starting from May, so the news gets a bit repetitive :)
We actually have English as an official language thanks to being colonized, one of the two in the EU now :p maybe I’m just a bit dense and didn’t understand the question well haha
And funnily enough pretty much half my cousins are now married to foreigners
And plenty plan to live here, I think it’s the weather and laid back yet family oriented attitude :) if you ever visit (after covid haha) hmu and I’ll try show you around
I’m glad
Hmm, worst weather wise would be around this time of the year, as you would risk having a few rainy days and sea would be cold
I’d say beginning to Mid June would be great
Would be around 25-29 degrees and sea would start getting warm
Sunny every day, festivals would be starting (although arguably the best would be the Zabbar festa in September, lots of drinking) clubs bars would be all open, historical sites might have discounts for beginning of summer and so on :)
See you soon buddy

Malta has a very rich history
1565, seeing possibly the greatest and most important siege of all time
Can I die
Like can I be killed
Or can I just roam around like a phantom
If so 1565 during the Great Siege :) OR when 1798 when we locked the French in our on capital city and laid siege to it
Never, the closest we get is to window shattering hail
We use commas to seperate thousands and a point to seperate the decimal
That's one of the things *~~forcefully~~* given to us by the UK, alongside left-hand driving and other things
This seems so strange
It’s like the British and mainland Europe just always wanted to do things differently
Atheism is becoming more common by the younger generations, but it's still kinda frowned upon and it's better if you keep it to yourself
Malta's population is still quite conservative and deeply into Catholic Christianity
Extremely uncommon, all normal constables are unarmed, unless they are going in to do an arrest, then they are allowed to carry a pistol
But the rapid intensive unit (tough quick guys) are armed and have shotguns and smgs in the car
The detective plain clothes unit is also allowed to keep weapons on them
Any police that have had threats against their life or family can also gain permission to carry a weapon
I would expect it’s because of the rise in terrorist attacks due to ISIS in the last 5ish years
Ah ok
Similarly to the RIU division in Malta
Big overhaul meant more spending on equipment
We just had a large spike in cases due to a party in a hotel, as mass gatherings are allowed, one asymptotic case has given it to 17 others till now, with 16 more discovered
We were close to 0 active cases a week ago
Quite worried for students when they go back to school

Really depends on the situation, if they live with their parents, if they are educated + get a job in the field they are looking for etc
Lately the introduction of a lot of gambling companies that pay much more then the norm has skewed the average salaries
A junior trader would earn 30k plus while the average wage is 19k, then accountants would also earn much more (but that job island numbingly boring so that’s acceptable)
I work in the finance industry and am not technically specified in anything and I earn the average
I live with my parents and with the way covid has stopped any aspect of socializing my savings have gone up, I’d say 70% is saved
The norm would be 40-50% a month
If i would have to take rent and general expenses into account this would plummet, maybe just 10%.
City planning, just actual laws and guidelines for how buildings should be built in a way that it keeps the village/city looking good, no random 10 story apartment buildings that ruin the waterfront and skyline

Love Rino Gaetano
Most villages have Patron Saint day feasts where local band clubs will lead a parade, one of the best, 'in my opinion' , is the Haz-Zabbar one, where the two opposing clubs, green and blue, meet, separated by barriers and police, and shout and sing obscene songs about each other
Fight use to be quite common but when a couple people got grievously hurt, it was banned for a few years to let people learn the lesson and cool of, which has worked  apparently
That and we love our fireworks
Welp
Nothing abnormal really, just your regular shady deals and tax evasion
Only difference is that this time, the opposition party is too busy self-destructing over minor issues leaving the government virtually free to do whatever it wants
Well, they were invading the island, and had been periodically attacking the island for the past few decades, looting, burning and enslaving the population of any village they came across on the way
Also the Maltese were outnumbered significantly, with about 2000 professional soldiers, 3000 Maltese "volunteers" and a further 3000 strong informal civilian militia against 40,000 various ottoman troops
So fear tactics were heavily used to compensate to the point where we started firing the heads of enemy soldiers out of cannons at them
We would keep drinking till 4, then go to a village called Rabat, there’s a classic Maltese pastizzeria that sells pies and tea and most importantly the best Pastizzi on the island, it use to be for hunters and farmers as it opened very early, but now it’s over run by us drunk idiots that come back from clubs
He has the classic pea and ricotta Pastizzi, but then he makes chicken, and sometimes anchovy ones, which are just amazing
A dozen pastizzi
You'll find someone open at any time
We have 2, please advise which
'H' as is is silent ( with some exceptions)
Something else the Maltese got from Italian
We have both Acca and the more dry H like for Home or House, mainly for more Semitic words
My country has around 4000 years of recorded history and prehistory going back 7000 years
When learning our country's history, it is usually divided into periods with quite clear demarcation lines
This makes it easier to remember things
At school we do not go into that much detail as it is impossible given the time available and the amount of detail involved
Some students continue to study history at University but they specialise in one period or other
Degrees in Archeology are also offered as there are still things which are occasionally discovered accidentally during construction works and they must be studied carefully
One of the sites which was discovered by accident in 1902 is now a World Heritage site and one of the best preserved and oldest underground temples in the world, going back over 5000 years
Haha, reminds me of my history lessons about Malta
The last 'pillagers' were the Brits
But in Ireland you have some beautiful prehistoric sites, like Newsgrange
I visited it, but our Sun temples are slightly older than Newsgrange :-)
17/18 if you finish A levels on time, some people take 3 years, some try finish all subjects in one year
(not sure if this is still an available option)
Then usually 4 years in university
We have trade schools you can go straight to instead of A levels, is advanced trade schools after A levels

I mean, the 'o' sound in "Oh dear

Edit: Nope, I'm dead wrong
Back to my hole
There's only one proper university, the University of Malta, so there's your question answered
We have the qassata, which is traditionally filled with [ricotta] with [peas] or with [spinach and anchovies] We also have pastizzi, which are also filled with either [ricotta] or [peas]
that sounds like a pretty good 1-move-ahead strategy game for kids

For us I think it would be the Great Siege of 1565
Highly outnumbered Knights who fought off a ottomans
Ah wait, you said city not nation
It did occur in various cities
If that counts
Just respect the norms and values and don’t make fun of places of significance, historical monuments or the country’s flag
The word for "slug" in Maltese is "bugħarwien". Għarwien means naked
I don't know what bu means though
Snail is bebbuxu
Well, there is a place called Bubaqra
Baqra is a cow
There is an animal of some sort called bużaqq
Żaqq is belly
Maybe the bu is connected to snails but I think it is a prefix
Maybe from Arabic
I don't know
Not at all surprised
In my country, there isn’t really a region which is hated (probably because we are such a small country) but I would probably say that but as for a region which is generally liked, I would probably have to go with Imdina
It used the be the island’s capital back in the Middle Ages and everyone can appreciate the architecture and just overall feel of the city
Same in Malta
In the early months after first opening, [there would be stampedes whenever a bargain would pop up]
Malta is a tiny EU nation but it mentioned in the Bible here: Acts 28:
Acts 28 New International Version (NIV)
Paul Ashore on Malta
28 Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta
2 The islanders showed us unusual kindness
This places the existence of Malta as a country to at least 60CE - i.e. 2000 years ago
Malta was first inhabited in around 5900 BC, but it's proper independence from the British Empire came at around 1964
So Scotland isn't a country
No we are not like Mykonos in Greece
We were always a distinct nation
Just because we were ruled by some other empire does not make us not a nation
We had our own currency, we have our own language (which is now one of the official languages of the EU)
Our language is unique in the world because it is the only Semitic language, written using the Roman alphabet
Our national flag goes back to at least 1000 years in time
Malta has the oldest free standing temples in the world - we are a very distinct country
Exactly
Well, people can literally buy our citizenship if they have enough money
I essentially think that they're whoring out our citizenship
one hour/one and a half hour in traffic to there and back

What is a strange fact about your country's history
Malta for example has had 11 forigen rulers in the last 2000 years
Haha, I think a better example  would be how the entire population was enslaved by the Arabs at a point, and the islands were left uninhabited for about 170 years until it was repopulated by Arabs from Sicily
Well i guess you really can accomplish anything if you put your mind to it
Truly, the feat of gods
I love the idea of a polish colony
I tried a [Mont Blanc] for the first time ever in paris a few years ago
I have never experienced a purer form of happiness until that moment
hey
Likewise :D
I noticed that some of the actual citizens (read: the north) were not having their passports renewed so readily
relocating in droves to Germany, you say
Nice interactive breakdown here:
Yep, so you need to go to the Greek side to have a baby with any hope of a passport, how messed up is that
Glad to see Şener bey leading the unions to take it to court
Interesting, I had heard different
(and sorry, you're right
I didn't meant assign strict cultural labels like that, I meant  'the south' but was just using the terms I'm familiar with
I didn't think of the associated division it invokes)
That is certainly interesting
anecdotally I know of two T/C + T couples who had their children born on the south side to give their children cypriot passports
From what you are saying, these children would still have no claim to citizenship, unless overruled by the CoM
My guess would then be that the CoM are quite commonly not above bribes or old neighbourly favours ;-)
I find it funny that a child born from a T/C + T couple in Turkey *does* appear to be able to get Cypriot citizenship if one of the parent's is a Cypriot:
> Article 7
> (1) A  child  born to a married Turkish  father  or  mother,  whether  in  Turkey  or abroad, is Turkish citizen
> (2) A child born to a Turkish mother and a foreign father out of wedlock is Turkish citizen
> (3) A child born of a Turkish father and a foreign mother out of wedlock acquires Turkish citizenship if the principles and procedures regarding the determination ofdescent are met
> Place of Birth Article  8
> (1) **A  child  born  in  Turkey,  but  acquiring  no  citizenship  from  his/her foreign mother or foreign father acquires Turkish citizenship by birth
So as long as the father doesn't declare himself as Turkish, I think the child could get a Cypriot passport

Abortion is a huge no no in my country
Even bringing up the topic will probably get you into a huge argument
In fact we are the only European country where it is still completely illegal even if the mother's life is in danger, which is just barbaric
> homosexual acceptancy graphcs
That's pretty much the only thing that makes us 'progressive'. In reality we're very conservative
The LGBT community is still persecuted in the streets especially transgender individuals so make of that what you will
In other areas we're not progressive at all, we've only recently voted for the right to divorce in a referendum (2011), made cremations (2019) and the morning after pill legal (2016)
Abortion, prostitution (paying for sex is legal only) and euthanasia are still punishable
Our conservative nature stems from our deep Christian roots and values
We have similar but with different scope

It’s so interesting to see some1 from such a micro state here and to get their view, like Malta is considered tiny, then there are you guys
I understand buddy
At least you aren’t in the news for corruption every other week :)
Please, compared to Malta you guys are amateurs :p make way for some very funky Chinese and Russian millionaires that supposedly live in Malta and have our citizenship
I’m not sure which is worse
What do you think can be done for the continuation of the existence of your country
I would think it’s very difficult to keep a ‘nationality’ when you are barely 35k people
We’ve actually been quite a bit since the whole Panama Papers thing, had a few big arrests lately
One from the many we have  in Malta is the "Belliegħa" (Swolower)
Basically it's a monster that lives in the bottom of wells and if you look down into the well for too long it would swolow you
It was told to children to scare them from looking down into wells to prevent them from falling in
That we all have offshore accounts and launder money
It's just the government and the rich people that do that
Most regular people just drink alcohol and take drugs, leaving us with virtually no money to put in offshore accounts
The first time I was in England I was amazed to see people walking their dog in the rain
In Malta it rarely rains (that creates problems for us) so when it does rain we do everything possible to stay dry
Temperatures here are now touching the low 20s and I have changed to wearing Summer clothes
The temperature is very comfortable now but it is already too hot to be in the sun
L-Imperu Awstrijan-Ungariz
Most definitely and the Mediterranean will experience devastating droughts more often as well, yay us
Same, I remember walking down 8th Avenue and seeing these insanely tall buildings in the distance and thinking "these look like videogame graphics" because of how 2D and impossible they looked
They became much more 3D as we got closer
Our local memester, Grandayy
I think swearing is technically punishable by a fine
IF they know about us, usually they ask if what they hear in the news is true, corruption, a few car bombings etc, which unfortunately are true haha but still, having to explain it every time round your moral a bit
Small huh ?
7th most densely populated country in the world I think :)) (top ten anyway)
Malta has the second oldest free standing temples in the world, their older than the pyramids
>We are a relatively small country
Hahaha
I once encountered someone who warned a guy criticising the Maltese government to make sure he was using a VPN so the Maltese authorities wouldn't notice
Battleship
I think you're overestimating the power of the Maltese navy
Our fleet consists solely of small patrol boats and RHIBs armed with anywhere from 1-3 mounted machine guns (and one with a single bofors gun donated by Ireland)
Are you kidding
We're the fortress island, we were literally built to take on old-timey galleons (and early 20th century warships)
We've got 21 forts, 8 fortified redoubts, 8 heavily fortified cities, 42 defensive watchtowers, 29 armoured batteries, 2 fortified lines spanning the island and countless civil defence batteries left over from WW2
All we need to do is re-arm them all
The Nazis didn't even manage to take Malta, I'm sure we can handle another Great Siege
That’s one hell of a Netflix documentary in the making
Every 6 to 9 months here
Really depends on the person I think
Depends where they're from most of the time
Americans, Canadians, Australians and especially Brits (still feels strange to class them as non-EU) are definitely welcomed more by the public
But sadly, people from Africa, Middle Eastern countries, India and southeastern Asian countries are not as welcomed and definitely suffer more prejudice (especially when applying for work)
I remember I worked as a waiter and whenever a CV from a Middle Eastern person came in (or anyone with a traditionally Muslim name), my boss would throw it away almost instantly
Unfortunately, most of these people end up working bad jobs such as cleaners, garbage men etc
Although, a lot of people (especially women) from India and other Southeastern Asian countries do find jobs in hospitals as nurses
Most of the general public don't really care what someone's nationality is, but for some reason, many will still be hesitant to initiate conversation with someone from those countries I mentioned
Nope, we got it as a day extra on our vacation leave total
The current ongoing court case of the assassination of DCG
Yesterday one of the murderers plead guilty to be given a presidential pardon for another crime, and to have a reduced sentence of 15 years
(For more info about the case)
Hey
E it’s kindof ‘overlooked’ if that makes sense
The hitmen have been caught for a very long time so it was merely just the court process, what most of the population is waiting for is the case of Yorgen Fenech to be finished to see what the outcome of that is (he’s rumored to be the mastermind, but people expected either Kieth Schembri, or Joseph Muscat, the ex head of staff and ex prime minister for the past government to have been arrested by now, but no concrete evidence has been found for either of them) so really we are all just going on with our lives waiting
You have to understand that Malta is EXTREMELY political, as she was indeed a good journalist in the last couple years, for some reason she was also a blogger that pretty much gossiped and lied about ALOT of political figures, and that made her extremely hated
Her murder was unprecedented, but not to surprising
The only way for money laundering and corruption to stop, is for a completely independent police force to be appointed
Which is pretty difficult in a country of 450 thousand people
Selling of passports was decently legal no
Just yea a company used was laundering money but I think that was after her death
Honestly, depends which person you talk to, Labour supporters would not care about her legacy, hardcore supporters would be happy she’s dead
Nationalist supporters would consider her a legendary journalist that tried to bring down a corrupt government named died doing it
I would say the way the new commissioner was elected ( through a vote in parliament) is probably  the cleanest our police has been in awhile
Very true :) granted she went hard against the ex ‘new’ head of the PN before she was murdered, but correct she was considered part of the ‘old guard’ of the nationalist party
Yes Adrian Delia was the ex leader, the leaders of parties are elected by official members of the party, the tesarati in Maltese, so yes indeed there are a lot votes for favours in the inner circle of both parties unfortunately
Honestly the major change was the election of the new commissioner who is quite a hard ass, and might clear up the economic crime problem we have, or really he has to or we get black listed by Moneyval
Abela, in my eyes, is a narcissistic child in a mans body, but what can you do
Very welcome :) ask anything anytime, of course understand I’m only one person so my views could also be skewed
this is a fun video comparing Maltese and Tunisian, maybe you would enjoy it
No honestly our cases are skyrocketing, enforcement is non existent and I feel like the government is waiting it out hoping the vaccine roll out (which is doing pretty well) will slow down the rise in cases
We just say Grazzi

Edit: Basically, stuff I currently have in my bag
People making fun of the Italian military always pissed me off
I get that we didn't do well in a few wars but people need to understand that the average Italian soldier was not a coward
It was definitely a case of "great soldiers but bad officers".
It is quite offensive to those that have fought
We are in Africa
We didn't have Nazis, we had Mussolini sympathisers
A group (including a future Prime Minister) were deported to Uganda and a wartime spy named Carmelo Borg Pisani (who was helping the Fascists plan to invade Malta) was hanged
Can I count fortresses and chateaus
Then quite a few :)
And unite it with its other 5 sisters
We have a Christmas charity 24 hour program :) where shows etc are out on for prosper to donate, donations can be given the week before too, like I had gotten a tattoo that the payment for it had gone to this charity a couple years ago
Huge problems with stray/feral cats
They reproduce so damn fast
We have a whole street full, we can afford it so my mother feeds them, and when we can, we catch them and neuter
But all it takes is one female that we missed (street is kinda big and there is a large empty plot behind us that is full of trees and bushes so they can hide there and come out only to eat) that gives birth to another 4-6 every spring
Sometimes we are able to find homes for them :) we have around 3 that stay inside and 3 that live in the garden
Strangely we also get old ones who find our house (maybe because of the smell of the food
) and enjoy their last few weeks alive just sleeping on the couch and eating
We also had a chicken dumped on our doorstep (or somehow it escaped a truck or something), it was tiny and adorable
In general the whole country has a problem I think, and I would love if the environment ministry does something about it, for the cats themselves and for their aggressive invasive attitude to nature, they really love killing all the lizards/reptiles and birds in an area sadly
cheese and chicken
Ftira biz-zejt, crunchy sourdough bread with olive oil, tomato paste, tuna, olives, thyme and onion
<3 with a cold Cisk(beer) on the side
Not sure how to answer, would this be 0 or infinite since we don’t have one
Jk jk, we do hve a ferry between the islands, that’s 14 per car and 5 euros per person :)
All the time
Quite common, actually
Just don't leave a mess
Korean or Japanese
I find asian languages intresting
But we have a knock off called Krea, and a company that imports IKEA items when people order (more of a shipping company)
Zero
Haha better :)

Yep, it's tasty, so so tasty, but I'm not a huge fan of eating meat off the bone
Somehow Greek is quite rare here, sushi has made a big hit the past few years, but sometimes it’s abit too cheap to trust
If you mean local food, I would try find some small eateries, maybe band clubs of a village, or even a political club, doesnt matter of whom they usually cook the same food
Rabbit (fenkata), snails (bebbux), ftira (our bread), pastizzi
(ricotta or pea filled pastries), local goat cheese (gbejna) and sausage
plus some bigilla (bean dip) and local galletti(crackers), im getting hungry
this website pretty much has everything
yes its quite a mix of hearty meals, and Mediterranean style food, like olive oil and goat cheese,  would love to have you over here again
we have gotten more health conscious over the years so maybe you'll find healthier variants

I'd say these are two pretty iconic poetry quotes
"Mghandiex bzieq xnehli mieghek" which translates to  I don't have the spit to waste with you
Positive
I was thinking about the same book too
Extra fun because it was on the forbidden list of books  *Librorum Prohibitorum*
Separatist/Independence movements rarely have anywhere close to unanimous support, that's why civil wars break out so often
The only difference is really whether the west approves of it or not
Wouldn't *"democratic"* regime change imply majority support
This makes me want to watch Vikings idk why

London is amazing
but Berlin
I can't describe it
I fell in love with the city
My first night there I could not stop taking photos
Amazing city, hoping to return "soon".
Was supposed to come there this Wednesday
-.-
Try Mdina as well buddy
It is nicer ;)
Mein freund, das sind in der Vergangenheit
Heute sind wir alles Freunde
Ich liebe Deutschland und ich hoffe zu besuchen wieder am nachste Jahre
Entschuldigung für mein Deutsch aber ich bin die Sprache noch lerne
Sind Sie aus Bayer
ach, Ich verstehe
Danke :) Es ist gut zu lernen
Nein, aber ich wohne nicht so weit von Mdina
Ich wohne in Mosta, das hat die Kirche du hast beschreiben
Es war "blitzed" durch die Luftwaffe
Auch, Bayer München gefallt mir nicht :P
:D Since we are so near to Italy
Juventus is the way to go :)
Malta: Too drunk to even put it on the map
Is there an album with all the European Lo-Fi images
Maltese here
I keep seeing this word "rain" everywhere
What is this "rain" you speak of
Duda means penis in maltese
As a Maltese-American, this makes me happy
You all seem to forget about the islands which are not directly connected to the European mainland
Until and if they ever make a train from all EU islands such as for instance, from Malta to Italy, then this idea would be unfair as it doesn't take all member states into consideration
I don't think it's worsened, it's always been this bad bit now we can just see it more
We 1789 now boys and girls
That's probably the executioner
Journalists killed in Europe:
Malta-1
We say "Pariġi" and "Venezja". Italy best friend x1000 now
Getting a bit of an ecofascist vibe from this one to be honest
Malta has more cranes than trees
Nature doesn't exist in Malta
Maps that actually include Malta
To be fair, we are a small, hilly, rocky archipelago nation
Even if people weren’t there, the islands would not have trees
Yayyyyy
lowest number
Fuck my country
1% for Malta
Overrated
[Cranes are our national tree]
We have cranes instead of trees
Yes
What is a tree
Don't you know, my friend
They're road obstacles
25 % is such a small difference though
unless they actually meant 25%, couldn't they have reasoned she has a better character/people skills
Its not like jobs are all just about efficient you can be
How did they even quantify such things anyway and why release it
Mann is crown dependency of England
Unless I am thinking of different Mann to yours
What risk is he talking about
Its the uks risk not the rest of europes
No matter arguing at this point, it's a matter of days before you start finding out
Nobody contest the UK will survive, it's not like the apocalypse & if in the slight chance it doesn't the E.U. can always send foreign aid in a worst case scenario so
Time to be pedantic: The 200 Euro note represents Art Nouveau (early 20th century) not Modernism
You would never find those type of window details in modernism since the modernists' philosophy was a rejection of the very same intricate ornamental and floral styles that defined Art Nouveau and the later Art Deco (think of works by Frank Llloyd Wright, Le Corbusier and Mies Van Der Rohe for instance)
The 500 Euro note is closer towards representing the Modernist style, although it seems to depict contemporary architecture in general (not just Modernism, which refers to the specific style especially dominant until the 1980s, but a mix of styles popular in the present day)
Edit: In between Modernism and contemporary architecture we also had the rise and fall of Post-Modernist architecture during the 80s and early 90s, but this isn't represented on the banknotes
Ehh if you beleive these clowns over experts you kinda deserve it
I do feel sorry for those who don't but are being dragged along with the populous majority
You do realize we have just as much drills in metric right
This has nothing to do with measurements
That’s a moltres
Not a single van parked on the sidewalk
Fun fact: We would have been Italian today if Napoleon didn't invade
Since we were part of the two Sicilies (technically), I would assume the next step would be the Kingdom of Italy
But the French annoyed us so much, that we begged the Brits to come help us
We also begged the Brits to stay, and that changed the course of history
Italian is still very present today here though
I estimate over 80% know Italian today
Its a very common mistake, I wouldn't call it ignorance :)
To be fair, Maltese has a lot of Italian in it (mostly Siculu-Arabicu), so you were not totally wrong
Sorry
Its our guilty pleasure :)

Meanwhile, we're not when on the map
In Malta we say Chinese as well, since we were not included
Someone please ride on the roofs of the cars
Because it is the correct and older way to spell it
See commented bellow who delves into details
>The standard pictures are chosen when a country joins EU, and are to my knowledge unchangeable
The exception to this rule is when a country has its monarch on their coins (such as kings, queens or the Pope)
They can change it if this person dies and a new head of state is appointed
We've had three different Popes since the start of euro, and other countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands also changed their king/queen
In all cases, the respective country issued new coins
I see, we can change ours in only 2 more years then :)
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Love living in Malta wow so amazing
You know Malta is mostly fossil fuels coz of Nationalists, now with a new government we have renewable
It's true, we have fallen back on our energy targets, and we need to invest a lot more in alternative energy, but your idea for Comino is a non-starter
Don't mistake its "rocky desert island" appearance with minimal capacity for life; Most of the island is actually a bird sanctuary and a protected shrubland nature reserve
It contains native vegetation, and Birdlife International classifies it as an Important Bird Area because of the Shearwaters that breed there
There have recently been some afforestation projects, and camping has been heavily restricted by the environment authority
Solar panels and especially wind farms would ruin this aspect
But yeah I agree, we need more solar panels in our country
In my home town they are implementing a communal solar farm project [on the roof of a large water reservoir] and the project is being [extended to the other ~20 reservoirs on the island] It's not enough, but it is a good start
They also subsidise the installation costs of panels on private/residential rooftops, but the takeup of this scheme has slowed down recently
In my opinion we should have a law that every new building must have some solar panels on its roof
Plus more electric cars - they are perfect for our country, but very few people have one
Fuckin pastizzi
[Chuckles in Maltese]
Laughs in Maltese
Leaving out Malta entirely
Subtle
Well done
Well you've definitely insulted me
Where the fuck is malta
Same for Malta
Well at least Denmark (not in this case though) as a geographical feature actually appears
Just looking up maps of the Mediterranean a good chunk of them act like there's nothing but sea where Malta should be :(
Edit: Ironically enough, when I typed in "Maps without
" in Google, the first result to come up was Maps without Denmark
I see you have a point
What a waste of money lmao to waste on such a broken country
I want Tingynus ( or how its spelt) now
It tasted amazing
Aw man ! I wanted Sakotis badly (It is spelt Xakotis right
The girl I was visiting said it was a traditional thing, but I only had a small hand luggage with me and I couldn't take it back home
I left a part of my heart in Lithuania

Sorry I meant pronounced, not spellt
X in my language = sh so you are spot on
Reminds me of state TV in Malta after MEPs accused Malta of being a tax haven
Just to clarify, a *lot* of evidence is pointing towards a wealthy businessman who wanted her dead before she published an article on his uncle
He had some ties with government officials currently incriminated but most have resigned since and there has been a change in administration
I'm not totally in favour of nor defending the current administration either, mostly full of incompetent shady politicians
But I feel it's quite a claim to say "the government killed her" when it's very obvious the mastermind was this businessman
This thread is a cesspool
No stats for Malta
Where is Malta
Fidget spinners
Because Home Depot was closed that day
Guessing we're yellow
Not a fan of abortions, but in this case I'd say put it to a referendum be done with it
No one googles us :(
I'll take it
Vielen Dank, Herr
I come from a Mediterranean country that gets tourists from all over Europe
The older German tourists always look like they're going to go for a hike
But
we were part of the Roman Empire too
They also have a monument to an SS division in the middle of the capital square
Wasn't it used by Waffen SS Estonia division
So making a monument with insignia once worn by nazi division that committed atrocities is fine
I don't understand that logic sorry
Could have used a bunch of other symbols
Don't you have a swallow as a national bird
Could have used that or some shit
We need Malta next
Melting in 15 degrees
I know I am not a big fan of hot days, but damn you guys take it to another level
I mean a lab coat is close enough
Malta is not a microstate fuck off
Malta is a microstate
Lol we have multiple accents in Malta
I'm seeing words like Pivo, Gervosa and Sör, and for some reason seeing Leann casually there killed me
Is this parks and recreation
Yeah we might be doing bad stuff
but what about all those guys lunching negroes
Holy shit it's been more than 8 seconds
What a record
Can we get 12 hours
To be honest I am relieved that a second referendum will not be done
The UK threw up a tantrum about the EU even though they had a favourable position and now because things are not going their way they get an option to renegotiate and cancel
I don't think that's very nice and sets a dangerous precedent for all the countries currently in the EU
Means he has a bad tax lawyer
Is that Myrinne's house
I can't help but begrudgingly think that Trumps refusal to the Paris agreement was actually a good thing since it ended up strengthening other peoples resolve with regard to this issue
Malta enters the game
Your prime minister looks like Stephen Colbert
18°C and sunny all week, life is good in Malta
Yesterday was most definitely not sunny
Just checked
Nope, cannot find any there either
We'll have to get some from the EU as usual I guess
We have enough bus stops
Nah thats us, Sicily on the left and the tip of Italy on the right
Noticed there wasn't one for Malta so here's one that *really* pisses us off
"So are you guys Arabs or Italians
But how do you make a Maltese cross
You don't include them in a map of Europe
I love the Malta one
Exactly
This is a doctor we are talking about
Having women patients to examine should have way more physical contact than a handshake and is simply required if you are to be able to diagnose ailments properly
if he refused a handshake then that means he would refuse to touch women in practice as well which makes him a bad doctor
I mean all you have to do is use sanitizer after or before or both times and you'd still be safe from handshakes
This isn't about rules it's about principles
I cant wait when they will start funneling money through Malta
Will keep my job going
Reducing one's tax liability legally is not evil
We will rather die then close our tax system
Another jelous eurpean who cant handle oit economic success
Wait, where's Malta
I am interested in knowing
Not enough yellow in the world
I wounder who would win, Malta or Poland

We’re like the old Italian Lira of measurement
1 Belgium is 97 Maltas, 1 Germany is 1131 Maltas and an Australia - 24341 Maltas
Can confirm
We don't swear żobb ġoxx il-liba ommok
Maltese people are saints that never curse
According to this Malta also doesn't swear
Which is weird as many Maltese are talented in naming every Saint in the Bible when swearing
Lol heatwave

Malta is next on the list
Great job malta
Malta is red towards everything
Oh boy
Wow, is Malta serously all red in these
Im ashamed D:

I applaud you for adding Malta
Shit log LMAO
WHO WAS AGAINST
Who are the 225 cunts
And yet my country isnt involved
I remember having a couple of their comic books in English
They were relatively known in Malta
If something is awesome then it will be spread elsewhere, being translated into other languages eventually
Oh these, I didn't have many of their comic book as a kid but I remember growing through them multiple times to find more & more references & commentary hidden in their stories
Good times
I remember they made a live action movie starring Roberto Benigni
Kinda how like France has a place called Nice, so it's really weird reading tragic stories based there
[Here you go]
Huh
We fought a war
As a Maltese person, I appreciate this very much

Good job bro
You know a map is accurate when op remembers Malta exists
Yikes, can't say you're wrong
I was about to point and laugh
then Google informed me that the highest point in Malta is only 253 meters
Oh well, we still beat the Danish
Lol cute
Also, if you ever see tourists speaking what sounds like a mixture of Arabic, Italian and English, they're probably Maltese
And they're probably trash talking you
I'll take that as a yes
Fun fact, lumi means lemons in Maltese
Liba
It is also used to greet close buddies
"Awww libaaa" :D
Liba
Lumi means lemons in ours xD
Yes, confirmed :)
Which coincidentally means duck in Hungarian
Had a great chuckle in a Hungarian supermarket when I saw tubs of white duck fat with Liba written on them
Never heard anyone using that
Maybe it's a local thing
I heard qalbi
Oh god
Its a vulgar thing
Like Hello cunt /Hello asshole
Qalbi is a sweet embracing , on the other hand
(Qalbi literally means heart, btw)
I know it means heart
I just havent heard the other one
It's a very vulgar word so don't go saying it to anyone pretty much
It's usually used as an insult, like how you would use the word dick
For the supposed economic boom that Malta is experiencing, €1021 is not a good place to be in
