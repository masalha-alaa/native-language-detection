With Russia sadly out of the picture, I'm torn between Romania and Germany
Romania: nothing personal but the Carpathians would make an absolutely ideal place to live or go for a vacation if Romania was all sea
Mountains meet beaches, not as far away from me as Mediterranean and not as hot
Germany OTOH is the main Russia supporter in the EU both financially and politically
Us and Poland would benefit immensely in the long term if one of these two in a perpetual hammer-and-anvil situation were to disappear
The sovereign order of Malta
Just came here to write this
But where are we gonna work then
Uhh, we have a saying for that, "While the fat one is thinning out, the thin one will die of hunger". If it comes down to being killed off by politics and demographics we'll leave Germany so far behind
Our government recently introduced the first comprehensive app in the world for e-Documents
Now you don't need to have your plastic ID on you, you just need your smartphone
It works in most situations where your ID would be required: police, post office, domestic travel, buying tobacco or alcohol, etc
So that's pretty progressive, I would say
In 1917, Mykhaylo Hrushevskyi thought that People's Republic of Ukraine doesn't need an army (even thought there was a possibility to create a big, powerful army)
Partly because of this decision, Ukraine became independent and acknowledged around the world only in 1991
The 2 times it got betrayed and thus got divided by Poland and Russia
Oh you mean like electing a former comedian as a president
One of the biggest bruh moments for us was related to Sweden
I'm talking about [Battle of Poltava] .We took your side hoping that we together could win that battle and Ukraine will be independent
But we lost
[Sabaton created a song about this] even :)
Well hello there
I was looking for this one
Poor people live in a house or apartment that still looks just like when it was first built and/or settled, but it's seriously worn out by time and due to lack of renovations
If the house is 70-100 years old, it doesn't look interesting or homey - it's just very old and tiny, and often doesn't have conveniences
If you weren't poor, you'd build another wing to your house with an inside toilet and shower, but it would cost more than your tiny walnut shell of a house
Poor Soviet apartments are roomier and have all the conveniences, but they often lack maintenance
Many of these apartment blocks were built as temporary housing, and people still live in them
Building contraction and decay isn't exclusive to poor people's apartments, but when you have money, you can afford the maintenance
Poor people only do the bare minimum: fix wallpapers that peel off, fight fungus, paint over yellow stains, and place buckets if there's a leak
What fascinates me (morbidly) is that poor people slowly devolve "to their roots", i.e., don't have excesses and don't look too far into the future; don't read, don't strive, don't think of politics or the country as a whole - only of their household and what they're going to eat during the month/week/day, depending on the acuteness of their poverty
People work on land, preserve own produce for the winter, make their own stuff, fix clothes until they fall apart, sell what they grow, and become pretty autonomous from the state
Unlike downshifting, these are not fun and ecological activities - they're genetic survival mechanisms
A spider makes a web, and a poor Ukrainian makes a 3L jar of pickled woolen socks because the commies might come to take all the grain or the 90s might come to take all the non-material savings
Such a way of life makes gender roles valid again
Men have their traditional male chores back; they perform the regularly needed hard manual labor while women cook, clean, and care for children
Men work outside the house and women are in the house, and everyone is exhausted equally
Every one is dependant on others
Families live together in clans which isn't perfect for mental health and personal boundaries
Personal development is absent; people rarely travel within the country (usually to visit relatives) and never travel abroad
Alcoholism isn't a symptom of poverty, it's its companion, because drinking alleviates stress, postpones worries, gives relaxation to both physical body and mind (untreated mental issues)
The poster girls for Ukrainian poverty usually are elderly women in kerchiefs, near a decaying hut, selling homegrown food on asphalt, or begging on the corner (relevant [google picture search]
* [Example 1]
* [Example 2]
* [Example 3]
* [Example 4]
* [Example 5]
IMO, this is what I call "back to the roots". Poor people in Ukraine mentally live in one month/week/day, they're able to survive on their own without the state as long as they're physically capable
When a person becomes as weak and fragile as an elderly woman/man, and there's no family to support them, they live on margin and become social outcasts just like homeless Americans
Similarly to the US, the real image of Ukrainian poverty is the income difference between these outcasts unsupported by the state and the extreme wealth of the Ukrainian politics that take what legally belongs to common people in infrastructure, social welfare, and public healthcare
No, i am not a native English speaker, so i shouldn't have perfect English pronunciation without an accent
I do my best to speak without, but if i can't i wouldn't feel ashamed for this
Same for those who try to speak in my language, there is no reasons to feel ashamed
Not when I have to speak English after a long time of not doing so
Over time, I adjust and sound a little less "slavic" to my own ear
However, some native speakers told me that my accent is not that bad
Maybe they were just being nice
No, I sound like caricature Russian from a bad movie
Because iPhones are overpriced
Even a 2 years old model can easily cost 500$ or more here in Ukraine
USED
Whenever I think of Bucharest badly, usually I think of Ferentari, but maybe all of Sector 5 sucks
"Got stuck in traffic". When our public transport is in traffic, several cars from the same rout might get bunched together within 1-2 km leaving the whole route waiting longer
Unfortunately, we don't have separate lines for public transport
People can't get on their bus/mashrutka even when their section of the road is clear, so it's a plausible excuse
"I was just standing there, waiting for 30 mins until I desided to hop on another route which naturally took me longer".
On the other hand, people usually know their regular commute, and being stuck in traffic all the time is still judged as inability to alter your commute/get on it earlier to compensate the delay, etc
Either IT guy or janitor
Maybe both
IT janitor lmao
Yes, but my English is not that good to consider it as a particular problem
Not because of this, I just choose whatever variant of word I like more
Actually I was taught American English but I prefer to use British English
At school they wouldn't expect an answer if I used British English, one time in an English exam I wrote
"Colour" and I got some points taken because the teacher said so
That I mix American and British English
Well, for some purist such a mix may look weird
The only thing which was shocking to me is that among the homeless people there were many people who did not look like typical bums
There were people who looked totally normal (as fas as you can judge) and able to work but still they lived on the streets and begged
Well, I guess the winters in Arizona aren't that cold
Government gives humanitarian help to Albania right when we ask for it ourselves
Seems like a corruption scheme to me
"Soros conspiracy" is going strong here after recent elections in 2019
Yep, we have Soros conspiracy now, too
Basically new government started a few market reforms which will open the country to international investors (market for agricultural lands, new labor codex, privatization of state property)
Now all of the oligarchs united in one front against such reforms (because economic protectionism and restrictions is the way they became oligarchs)
And what happens when your Eastern European country is opening its economy to internationals
Good old Soros conspiracy is the way to scare the people
No way you'll give up your monopoly
Oligarchs are in control of the majority of TV channels, so it's not that hard to spread these Soros conspiracies, and the majority of Ukrainians are against market reforms, which is really sad
That there are a lot of Soros agents in government including prime minister, some others ministers and members of ruling party (some inner feud inside party, i don't know)
Also all this " conspiracy " comes from members of ruling party
In Ukrainian [the] order of [the] words can be changed in almost any way
So you won't know if I [am] writing in normal English or following [the] rules of your game
I even not know what here to write
Dearly ask you to world of Ukrainian grammar
Without cases or genders, she yet still looks enough looking like English
You [are] right
Fixed
It was written in pretty natural order
But I could write it in this way:
\[The\] order of \[the\] words In Ukrainian can be changed almost in any way
\[The\] order of \[the\] words can be changed almost in any way in Ukrainian
Almost in any way can be changed \[the\] order of \[the\] words In Ukrainian
&#x200B;
\[The\] last sounds less natural than \[the\] others, but still is correct
Major of Kyiv (Vitaliy Klichko) said: I have 2 secretaries, 4 of whom are in the Verkhovna Rada

No, I access Europe through my visual memory, and Iceland + the Faroe Islands are often out of the picture, but I know they're there above Scotland
As it's been discovered recently, I forget about Moldova, and I mean
It's bigger than Belgium and nearly the size of Switzerland or Denmark
And most of all it's right there - it's Romania's fin
Maybe I’m blind but I don’t really see many other Ukrainians
No, I read as usual and sometimes come back to an interesting thread and sort by new replies
If I want to reply, I quickly scroll down to see if there's someone replying for Ukraine and if I can add something to their reply instead of typing the same thing
I think there are no Ukrainians on reddit
All Ukrainians on Reddit are the same person -> me
I am you
at least the region that fights Russia back, when you just let kill on your soil whoever they please with no consequences
No, it's called *efficiency*
there were millions of Russians in German army in WWII, you don't call Hitler's army "Russian rebels", don't you
Saw such ad on YouTube at least five times today
Mostly positive
When somebody talks about Germans, the first topic that comes to the mind of a common man is a strict nazi occupant
But that mostly of the old generation, while millennials and younger think of funny language and high quality of life in Germany or huge german multinational companies
The quality of water depends from city to city
But as far as I know, most people in cities either buy water or refill it on some kind of public spring (especially in the region of the Carpathian mountains)
Some people also install personal filters for tap water
I personally buy water in a grocery store in my building which costs me ₴1 per liter (€0
03, $0
036)
Elderly people usually boil the water or don't care at all
However, after a few liters, you're gonna get a limescale deposit in your electric kettle and will start making a lot of whistling noise
It happens between any languages that you use fairly regularly, and the wolf you feed more grows fatter
When I use English for specific purposes, for example, arguing about the human rights of seashore gulls on the Internet but ignore the topic completely in real life, the needed vocabulary in Ukrainian or Russian escapes my mind completely
Not in Ukrainian or Russian, sorry, but I do care in English
Don't say that Ukraine is part of Russia
Don't call us russians when you hear our language or see Cyrillic
Russian or soviet symbolic, especially ribbon of sait george
UKish also not OKish I assume
what is the most correct way to call people of British Isles
Oh, haha, yep, we have it too
We easily understand Russian, because all Ukrainians can speak Russian, but we hate, when people call us Russians
My friends from Russia say that they don't understand Ukrainian, it's looks similar only visual
Nah, we prefer to turn it straight into a passive-aggressive verbal " skirmish ",sadly, but most of the surrounding countries still live by the past and with one we still enemies, like it was in the past
Maybe because Russia keeps doing the same shit that was many years ago over and over again
I've never heard them making an attempt at Ukrainian
Arrow speaking "perfect Russian" to Russian mobs sounded more like Arrow having a stroke
In Avengers, the [interrogating guy] speaks decent Russian, good flow, zero mistakes
Apparently, a second-third generation immigrant from a Slavic-speaking country
But his accent is some mix of American English and
Ukrainian
Something about those tall vowels and the way he pronounces CH
Natasha Romanoff's Russian is your typical Hollywussian
At least those are words and not just dying whale sounds
In America, there are many working actors who are native russian speakers, but such actors rarely get roles as speaking russian or just russian or ukrainian characters
Instead Jennifer Lawrence is Red Sparroooow
Yes
While it is unusual to say hello to random people on the street, unless it is very small village, when you meet strangers on a mountain road, you greet them
I once met a Greek woman whose name and surname were misplaced by a drunk priest who baptized her
That's fucked up, honestly
Nah, Russian and Ukranian dub are pretty good this days and go in four voices
Do people ride on roads on such bikes
It looks too dangerous to do so
Some people from Galicia and Zakarpattia speak super fast and have a thick Western accent, I actually sometimes think they're speaking Polish and not Ukrainian
In Ukraine people usually say «you will clean the courtyards of the city»
That the Chernobyl made most of territory unsafe to live
That we're not drinking vodka every day
Actually I even never tried it and I know many Ukrainians who don't drink alcohol at all
And in general we're not even in top 50 drunkest countries, even Sweden, Iceland and New Zealand drinks more than Ukraine
So yeah, I'm just tired of this stereotype
ah, so that's the real reason why workers push for 4-day work week
«сосиска в тесте» is called “pigs in a blanket” or “sausage roll” in english as far as I can tell, hot dogs are a bit different
We have ALOT of floods in Ukraine now
There weren't rains for at least 2 months and now it's the revenge time for the clouds
The Karpaty zone is nothing but water now
I think op meant "second largest country situated ENTIRELY in Europe"
Those words usually mean the same thing in English) The word you're looking for is ethnicity
Donetsk for sure, looking ugly as shit
Even if you ignore damages from artillery in some districts, it really became so ugly you feel like you got back into USSR
Last time I was there in 2017, I think, and family says it didn’t get better
Not saying it was a beautiful city pre war, but it got some vibes over there and during Euro 2012 everyone seems to like it
For Ukraine, unfortunately, everything east of Dnipro
I can't really think of one city on the left bank that isn't known for being ugly
Well, it’s possible, but so complicated and I wouldn’t recommend doing this at all
You can enter the area by crossing the border from Russia - but it will be considered illegal by Ukrainian authorities and you might get a ban to enter Ukraine for a while
Alternatively, you can cross border from Ukraine to Donetsk region - but you need to obtain a special permit by registering on a website, and believe me, as a foreigner, you will need a really valid reason to allow you to enter Donetsk
This how it would work in a usual world
But now, at this moment, due to COVID - it’s nearly impossible even for fellow Ukrainian to visit Donetsk
I don't know, I've never been to the US, but from people's accounts, it's noticeable there
Maybe because when you hit rock bottom, it's difficult to recover, especially when you're an addict or have a mental illness that has caused this whole situation
Our weird people are mostly mentally ill
When they cause disturbance or can't be trusted with themselves, they're detained/hospitalized
Elderly people with symptoms related to their age may act weird in public, e.g. they talk to themselves, collect useless trash (hoarding), act agitated
What we don't have is street preachers or loud conspiracy theorists with cardboard signs
Nope, those are, probably, the result of US Americans being encouraged to voice their opinions on any issue, even when those opinions are baseless
Social shaming
Maybe I phrased it poorly
I meant psychotic disorders, i.e. when people lose touch with reality
When they commit an offense and there's a basis to get them detained, they are placed in a governmental psychiatric facility for further examination and treatment
An absurd example would be the father of my acquaintance who used to drink heavily and posed a threat to his relatives
They called the police and ER and asked them to detain him
But as long as he didn't commit any crime and didn't hurt anyone (except for a couple of bruises and stolen possessions), they didn't have a legal basis to proclaim him incapacitated and treat him as such
He himself would just say "no" to hospitalization and both the police and medics would leave
Maybe someone other familiar with our laws will correct me or tell you more
Article 1
Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, law-based state
**Article 1**
Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state
Article 1
Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic,societal, legal state
Donetsk, Ukraine
It’s a frozen conflict zone
Some people want to stay in Ukraine
Some want to become Russia
Some want to become an independent country
What everyone agrees on is that kids aren’t able to go to school
Funding for civil services such as school have all but ceased, and no one wants to be killed, let alone by neighbors or people who claim to have their interests at heart
A generation of people, who haven’t died, is being lost because life can’t normalise
And just talking about this subject invites strong partisan opinions
The whole anti-soviet movement
A lot people think that Ukraine decided to join Soviet Union by its own, but that's wrong
Most people were against soviet policy, there were a lot of riots and liberation movements in 20's, UPA in ww2, dissidents in 60s, couple of riots in GULAG and much more
Wait are they related to the Vaterlandisch front (sorry for butchering German)
Ukrainian doesn't have the full dual form, but there are some words that are remnants of it
For example the word for moustache - вуса (voosa)
For a person who has a word прст in your language, you treat too hard on vowelless words
I'd say it was historically a dual form, which survived in strange rule of how to use nouns with numerals
Edit: it seems, it's being unrelated to the dual form
Not in EU, but I think DST is dumb
Next day after clock changes there's spike in suicides, and DST also creates unnecessary confusion
Spike is actually after both changes, from winter to summer and from summer to winter
What about Split, Croatia
There are big festivals and Yacht Week
These things bring tourists from all over Europe and Americas
It would be a good setting to combine boating with a hedonistic party atmosphere
GTA 6: Brat
Nope, I don't eat salo and borscht every day
What else cliches people have about Ukrainians
Not from Ukraine, but I remember Russian channel ran a story about how ancient Ukrainians dug up the Black Sea so they could wash themselves
Maybe the craziest theory I've heard is that Golden Horde has never existed and Mongols didn't invade Rus
People, who belive in this theory say that all the thousands people who died during The Mongol invasion were killed by forced christianisation
The Golden Horde is a myth that was made by rulers of Rus' to hide the evidences of their acts
I saw some book from Ukrainian "historian", unfortunately I don't remember his name
In it he describes that Ukrainians have lived on the Earth for thousands of years and took part in almost all main events in history
For some reason, I'm not surprised
Yeah, seen those
But I mean every country has those nutjobs
Sometimes
We joke about Kuban being "historically Ukrainian territory" and it should be taken by "peaceful referendum" just like our eastern neighbor did to Crimea
If anyone is hoping that Belarus will peacefully transform into a democracy as a result - it won't.
First of all, Lukashenka ain't giving power up peacefully
He will resort to anything in order to keep it, thinking replacing him without violence is possible is nothing more than wishful thinking
I mean, Minsk is already stacked with  troops
Second of all, every opposition candidate there is as much pro- Russian as Lukashenka is
And bring pro- Russian and democratic simply doesn't mix together
You have to remember, true pro-democracy opposition in Belarus has been locked up for years at this point
To be honest, whatever the result it doesn't look like much will change
Belarus will continue to be a Russian puppet
Maybe a little bit less authoritarian, but that's probably about it
> I can’t believe how detached Lukashenko is form the public
What's so unbelievable in that
It's not even 5 out of 10 on my delusional-dictator-meter
When your political party loses the legitimate election it's not the loss for democracy
It's the loss for your party
You summed up my thoughts perfectly
Couldn't say better
He is making deals with Russia, which is much more important for his security than dealing with the opposition
And the man has been a dictator for the last 30 years soon, he most likely truly thinks this is something he can easily solve and everyone will eventually shut up like always
Dictators are usually not the most reasonable people
> To be honest, whatever the result it doesn't look like much will change
Belarus will continue to be a Russian puppet
This is the point I made about what is likely to happen in Belarus and that is exactly what happened in Armenia
Did it become less authoritarian
Yes, it did
But that's about it
Even currently, it has no chance of becoming a truly western-style democracy
Armenia's case is a bit different though, with the difference mainly coming from the fact that it's sandwiched between two states that won't hesitate to destroy it and is in need of constant protection
So yeah, Armenia is a place where Russian interests are always gonna be safe, no matter the government
>Kyrgyzstan is also pretty democratic at the moment while also being in the Russian sphere
Kyrgystan is also the least inside of Russian sphere in a whole region (except, maybe, for Turkmenistan, but that's a completely seperate conversation)
And the thing is - unforunately, Kyrgystan has very little geopolitical significance so it's not like allies are lining up
Moscow gives a lot of shit about political structure in the country because controlling a single dictator or at least a very select few individuals who are in charge of the state is miles easier than controlling a democratic process
It's just cheaper and way safer
You have terrible tack records with those - a dozen of revolutions and only two won, and one of them won so badly people cried out for a new dictator just to get rid of the revolutionaries
True, but still there are many countries with a win/lose ratio way above French and with their successful revolutions not descending into the reign of terror
You don't get points for trying and failing a lot of times
Car service
So, in recent years many people in Ukraine started importing used cars from the US and discovered that many of those cars (not only cheap, even premium brands like Lexus) lacked service like oil change (it seems like instead of every 9000-12000km the oil is changed with the engine), brake servece, transmission oil, etc
We used to straight-up watch Russian channels, and they weren't really foreign
In the USSR, there was the central TV broadcasted from Moscow
After the dissolution, those few Russian governmental channels remained alive and kicking, showing mostly the same classic Soviet movies, entertainment tv shows, and the news were about the whole ex-Soviet space, but from the Russian POV
Ukrainian newspapers were printing TV schedules including Russian channels as well (the aforementioned governmental channels + new commercial chanels)
Sometimes Ukrainians wanted to watch something from a TV annonce, but were too late because Moscow and Kyiv had 1 hour difference in time, and the viewers didn't even account for that since the channels weren't perceived as foreign
We also had many shared celebrities (modern and Soviet), so we had shared cultural news as well
(Ukraine borders Belarus, but its TV has never been broadcasted here)
I wouldn't say it just stopped in 2014 - it had been slowly diminishing through the 2000s. Now we have equal amounts of news about Russia, Belarus, Poland (which is significantly less for Russia)
Obviously, Russian political and economic news draw a lot of attention since these aspects are currently important to Ukraine
But we don't get to know as much about Russian culture, movies, TV shows, what is popular there, about Russian celebrities or Ukrainian celebrities that moved to Russia for good
Finally, answering the main question of whether we feel overwhelmed by the news from Russia, I'd say we don't. We get as much Russian news as everyone; the difference is, we hear them in the language we actually speak, get all the references and minuscule details, and can interpret them in the context of those shared informational years
We also have specific channels that are like Fox news, so the pro-Russian people can switch to them and relax hearing the good old Russian POV
Neither president has had the balls to do something to them since these channels belong to oligarchs
Not much, at least since 2014
Most of the news is about our "inner kitchen", but sometimes some key news from Russia  also present
Life here is not so boring, that we must discuss news from our neighbors
Well, how the tables turned
I've never seen such deck
But it looks interesting
May to September: below 23
October, April: below 15
Rest of the year: below 5
* A female name (not one word, but a concept)
* Mutant - because Europe, and especially [the EU] looks like those monsters made of doll parts
Or it's the Amnesia monster if you imagine Portugal+Spain as the head and France as the gaping mouth
* Blue - because it's the most traditional colour associated with Europe
But of course, as many people have stated, Europe is first and foremost the image of the map
In Russian it means to be brave
Usually it is said after something brave is done
Upd
Sometimes it could be said about people who have done something very hard
On the Parliament and local elections sometimes it was possible to vote for the people who I really respect, like volunteers or war heroes
But in case of party and president it's always lesser evil
Just because professional politicians are like that
I am not able to vote yet, but I belive in party and candidate that I support
“Where are you from

"*[[this dish] is Russian*" or "[*[this dish] is Polish*"
If you want a Russian soup, try [щи/shchi]
Same with Ukrainians
Most people call any famous Ukrainian that was born in the Russian Empire Russian
This annoys us so much
Googling people before you meet them is creepy and just straight fucked up
Early Modern English snippet is more flowery than the Middle Enligh one
The latter is more succinct and easier to read, although, both are no problem to read and understand
To enjoy
The Old English text is a different story
I just don't understand it in both written and pronounced forms
1943 but Poland always overexaturates it
Norway: Eugenics and lobotomy, specifically targeting various "undesirables". Also the assimilation of the Sami
Ukraine: War crimes committed by members of SS-division Halychyna and UPA
Volhyn massacre
(Not saying that the Polish didn't do fucked up things to Ukrainians before this)
We do similar thing on [Ivana Kupala] We need to jump over a fireplace 3 times with our loved ones
I don't drink and don't like salo
What's up with your neighborhood
I thought it is Soviet thing
Why is it so popular in Romania
Drinking coffee in sauna
For those who don't know, it's a bad idea
Don't do it
"Russian salad" is used only abroad
Here it is called as "Olivje" or just as "Meat salad".
Yes, as u/hesapmakinesi told, caffeine may for short periods of time increase your blood pressure which is already high because of sauna
Probably nothing to worry about for young healthy person
I'm not sure in which temperatures do you use sauna, but I like to use banya that is very hot and to get massage with bath brooms to the point that I'm dizzy and at this point I suppose it can be really dangerous to drink caffeine contained beverages
Jesus Christ this picture is so unbelievably Eastern European
Do Finns pour water on stones in sauna
Sun - Сонце neutral
Moon - Місяць - male
Сонце (Sontse) - neutral
Місяць (Misyats) - male
Земля (Zemlya) - female
**Earth** --> *"Земля/Zemlia"* feminine, often depicted as a woman, a mother
**The sun** --> *"сонце/sontse"* neuter, depicted as a freckled child's face
There were four male Slavic pagan gods, one for each season
However, depicting the sun as a male person isn't common in popular culture
All I can see through googling is some modern pagan fanart
Pagan idols looked more [like this]
**The moon** --> *"місяць/misiats'"* masculine
One of the most common images for the moon is a sickle
Informally and poetically we call a crescent "a moon sickle" or "a young sickle" if it's a growing crescent
Sometimes a crescent is compared to [a cow with horns]
we have it as well, it is awesome
some plates are too weird shape for such racks and have to be stacked as in underdeveloped Western Europe

ok, they sleep well, but how do you defrost them back to life then
I remember something similar called Lolek and Bolek
Is this a different cartoon with two bald children
Well, historically - probably Catherine the Great, also Stalin or anyone connected to communism, although he’s adored by boomers
You see, there are many Ukrainians who support him and his actions (the same ones who praise Stalin and the whole USSR thing), but generally, we do
I don’t know how, but grief for the victims of this genocide manages to mix in people’s heads with idolatry of soviet regime and this really sucks
Ukrainian - very hard in both grammar and phonetics for non-Slavic people
But, even some other Slavs (i.e. Russians, Belarusians
) find г hard to pronounce
The grammar is kinda confusing for many people because of the amount of suffixes and prefixes
Gaining accent might be hard, although I'm not sure
I haven't seen many people that learn Ukrainian
I don't mean it's impossible to learn Ukrainian, you just need a lot of work and time
To Lithuania and other countries who help us during our rough times
I wanna thank all countries that have been supporting Ukraine since 2014
Especially Poland, Lithuania, Georgia and Canada
And special thanks to USA for all those javelins
Thank you for acknowledging it wasn't just Russia
I can understand many words in Polish
It is similar to Ukrainian,but there are a lot of silent sounds, like sz or nose vowels ę. When I studied Polish it was much easier to learn for me then foreigners I  with whom learned it,but it also was a challenge for me,especially writing
Overall, I can get what they are talking about
>silent sounds, like sz
They're called [digraphs] - two letters, one sound/phoneme
Just a remark
Oh thank you
I just had no idea what is the name for it in English !
Odesa, Ukraine
For some reason, it gained quite a bit of poplarity recently, and it's really not worth it
The beached inside the city are awful, the city itself very run-down and the prices are on European level
Basically, European level prices for very not European level service
The only reason to visit in my opinion is if you really wanna party
Lviv definetly worth a visit, especially if you are into good food/good alcohol type of tourism
Don't get me wrong, Lviv has a ton in terms of architecture and stuff, but the reason I go there every year is definetly for the restaurants (there are a bunch of themed restaurants of all kinds which I personally adore)
Kyiv in my opinion is a bit more boring, but of course it got a ton too see and do
If you are into nature, mountains and castles - Carpathians is a way to go
Places like Mukachevo, Yaremcha or Uzhhorod
If you are into beaches - I had good recommendations about Chornomorsk, but honestly, other countries definetly have better beaches
I live in Lviv
It worth a visit, but the whole city is overcrowded
If you want to have a better experience, I don't recommend you to visit it on Friday / weekends or search for quiet streets and secret places
Cafes, food, and drinks are nice, especially for tourists, because everything's cheap
If you will have spare time and you're into quiet towns with nice architecture and almost empty streets, visit Ivano-Frankivsk (130 km from Lviv)
Though it doesn't have as many entertainments as Lviv, it's a nice place with a charming atmosphere (at least the last time I was there)
For hiking - go to the Carpathian mountains
These are my favorite spots: Nesamovyte lake, Shpyzi, Homiak mountain, and Goverla (but I recommend the path from Nesamovyte lake)
I've honestly never head anyone complaining about Polish tourists ever
I mean, people like to talk shit, you know
Most of us perfectly understand that especially an older Polish generation will definetly talk shit about Ukraine from time to time, but that's alright, it happens
I mean, we're at war with Russia, so there's that
Why, I thought we were closest brothers
Our languages are so similar we understand each other when it's spoken and we don't have any quarrels
You mean occupation of Eastern Poland in 1939 by polish-soviet
Then it's until 1939, I'd say
Can relate to party+beach destinations
Just any place attractive mostly for nightlife, alcohol drinking/drug consumption and white people with dreadlocks, so music festivals as well
Also, the more traditional for the former USSR countries beach+sea destinations in Turkey, Egypt, etc
, where the staff speaks better Russian than English
Just as I replied to another comment here
tlen - oxygen in Polish and decay, ruin in Russian
ołów is lead (Polish), olovo is tin (Russian)
zapomnieć - forget (Polish), zapomnit' - remember (Russian)
and some Russian vs Ukrainian
нежить - running nose (ukr), undead (rus)
бабка - dragonfly (ukr) vs old woman (folksy rus)
maybe OP speaks a dialect where they don’t have the s - ß distinction
That second usage is great, I need to steal that haha
In general yes, despite all, i like my country
Still, i want to move and live somewhere else for some period of time (like a year or two) and then move back
I'd like to exchange my Lada for a Ford Granada
Love the idea, I think Frankie Goes to Hollywood already explored this in “Two Tribes” and their answer was that no one wins
But I say Russia
Putin is a martial artist, but if his ice hockey “performance” is indicative of his martial arts skill, Russia might have problems
Either way, Russia gets disqualified after winning
Drinking to become a little drunk and have a good time or relax is considered OK - this is why people drink
You are supposed to know how much is OK for you
Overdrinking is not respected
All children and teens being slender

[This] was nonexistent
Now you enter a regular 3rd-grade classroom, and some 9-yo boys are pear-shaped and as tall as their adult teacher (female)
Same thing with winters
Last normal winter with decent amount of snow and normal temperatures (-15 to -5) was in 2015/2016 or in 2016/2017 in my region
Since then, winters are just extended autumns
Also, last two years' winters were not only snowless, but also dry, so plants had rough years afterwards
You need to be a total clown to deny climate change after this
Even worse with summers
Every summer there's a new heat wave, worse than the last one
and that's for good
minor traffic accident in lada and you're handicapped
some shops sell deepfried sea fish skin as a snack
not particularly tasty I must admit
but skin of fried river fish is delicious
Export Ladas are better than ones that were made for domestic (Russia + post-Soviet countries) market
It's actually huge sometimes
Export Ladas had light alloy wheels, air conditioning (rarely), roof hatches, better color options, there was even a Lada 2108 convertible
Most of these things were either added by local dealers or by local assemblers, if cars were exported as kits to some country
The latter was the case with Finland
Pretty much all Slavic languages
We're lucky to be on the intersection of western and eastern Slavic languages (even though officially Ukrainian counts as eastern Slavic language) to have good grasp of the roots of both
Those that use Latin alphabet may be tricky because of weird letters and combination of letters they use to write sounds that alphabet was never designed for
Лише 80%? Мені завжди здавалося, що ми розуміємо мови одне одного на 98-100%, навіть в усній формі. Я без проблем дивлюся відео білоруською. Деякі слова дуже схожі, а деякі можна просто вгадувати. Наприклад, август (рус) - це жнівень (біл) або серпень (укр) - обидва вказують на час жнив.
Probably salo
I don't think we will ever stop eating it
Our food is not even remotely about "fast" but the thing that comes to mind when thinking about a snack in Kiev would probably be [Kyivska Perepichka] (a kind of a sausage roll)
I've heard that when the USSR leaders died all TV channels stopped their usual repertoire and broadcasted something neutral like Swan Lake (btw, also duck-like birds-themed)
It since has become a joke
For example, some time ago Putin was absent from public view for a while despite some events that required his reaction
I don't remember what or when it was, but there was a wave of jokes that people couldn't wait to watch Swan Lake
Maybe it wasn't a thing in Hungary because it wasn't one of the republics of the SU
>It was supposed to be 'We're profoundly shaken by the death of Stalin
' but because of the typo it's basically 'We're deeply ordered to announce Stalin's death
Looks like they started the Khrushchev Thaw right away
But seriously, so weird were the times that I can't imagine how some people still can feel nostalgic about it
For one, my country is being torn by war and conflict at the moment
I think after so long you just get used to it and in time forget what the initial reason for the war was
As for countries beating the shit out of each other in the world wars, I don't find them getting along unnatural
After two wars of that scale, Europe just doesn't want a sequel to that
It's like post-civil war US
You have your regrets, you have your grudges but you don't want to continue the conflict
Plus, most of the reasons for the wars in Europe are gone by this point as there's democracy everywhere, most of the Germans (and Austrians) got deported out of their former lands in central Europe and generally most of the countries are content with their situation
That isn't true for Balkans(excluding Greece) and Eastern Europe though due to the main problems still being a thing
There's a fuckton of Serbs in most ex-Yugoslavian countries, a fuckton of Russians in post-soviet states and Russia isn't content with it's place in the world
Overall, I reckon, if the Russians calm down with their imperialism a bit and the Serbs (and perhaps Hungarians) don't try restoring their respectful empires, the peace in Europe will be a very long-lasting phenomenon
Mainly from you being in a similar position to Russia and Russia attempting to do that at the moment
I know that it may be an exaggeration but you never know
What I think is "it wouldn't be strange if in the near future Serbia claims lands of Bosnia or Croatia" rather than "Alarm
Serbia is going to war and the powderkeg is exploding once again
Not really
Just seeing how you guys beat the shit out of literally everybody in your region back in the day makes me doubtful
For one, we didn't expect Russia to act the way it did with it's minority over here so it wouldn't be strange for us if you did the same to Bosnia or Croatia
Also we have that stereotypical image of a Serb here that hates each and every of his neighbours (especially Croats), is super nationalistic and thinks of Russia as a great friend of their nation
So yeah, your image isn't that good over here
Tbh it's more "friend of my enemy is my enemy" thing
As you may know, we generally don't like Russia
This has objective reasons and isn't going to change radically unless something big happens
And looking back historically we can't help but see you guys as something similar to Russia
The same big Empire that collapsed, the same broad federation of many nations that privileged heavily the main one, the same superiority complex etc
While some of the key similarities between you guys are nonexistent by this point, we still can't unsee you as the Russia of the Balkans
I guess you know way more about the Serbs, living that much closer to them so I wouldn't argue with your position
As for our media, that's where you're a bit off
As of now, our media are in a kind of hybrid war with Russia
That is, pro-ukrainian forces call Russia and anybody affiliated with it aggressors, threats to world peace and enemies (and from our position, they aren't that wrong), while pro-russian forces call our modern government traitors/junta, advocate for close ties with Russia(i.e becoming a Russian puppet like Belarus) and privileges for Russian language, while being financed directly by Russian government
So our media aren't exactly impartial at the moment and that probably won't change in the nearest future
What I think of Serbs is based by what they did historically
That is because overall most people (excluding pro-russian folks, I haven't the slightest idea what that retards are thinking of right now) here abridge and simplify Yugoslavia to the following
•Yugoslavia is Soviet Union but smaller, Serbian and southerner
•Serbs oppress Croats and Bosniaks
•Big bad Serbian dictator died and Yugoslavia started to crumble
•Yugoslavia collapses, everybody fights everybody
•Serbs bad, Croats good
As you see, people over here(me included) aren't really that knowledgeable on the topic
I'm sorry if I offended any Serbs though, that wasn't my intention

Folk music
It was considered boring and outdated by many when I was a kid
Only old people were enjoying folk performances in parks and on TV
Although, many kids were attending folk dance classes and bandura/accordion classes
Anyway, as an adult, I really enjoy how many Ukrainian electronic folk bands there are
Also, white singing isn't everybody's cup of tea, but I like it
In the 90's folk music was a couple greybeards and auntie types singing cringy old stuff on public access TV
Now it is being reinvented in a multitude of styles, is definitely a hip thing to do, as other aspects of the cultural revival that slowly started with the 2004 revolution and really took off after 2014, with some of the performers going international, something absolutely unimaginable back in the 90's. So to answer your question, yes, definitely
There always have been folk artists of all ages: kids, teens, young adults and adults, older people, elderly
It's just that now the listeners are getting younger and the musicians often add some twist to folk, mix it with other genres or rework other genres using folk instruments
If you haven't, also try [Bulgarian folk] I mean, if you enjoy folk music
This year, we were to send **Go_a** with a song called "Solovey". They aren't new to the folk electronic scene
They've been in it for 8 or so years
Some of their songs that I like:
[Go_A - Веснянка]
[Go_A - Жальменіна]
[Go_a - Рано-раненько]
* **KHAYAT** - a young folk electronic artist who also was on Vidbir to Eurovision:
[KHAYAT - От і вся лбв]
[KHAYAT - OSOKA]
* **The Doox**
[The Doox - Гриць \(Hryts'\)]
[The Doox - Колискова \(Live\)]
* My personal favourites, **YUKO**. They take authentic folk lyrics and mix with own original music
[YUKO - Hreblia]
[YUKO - Водубьору]
[YUKO - YARYNO]
[YUKO - Buvaite Zdorovi]
* **Alina Pash**
[Alina Pash - BOSORKANYA]
Woo contemporary Ukrainian music shameless plug
In no particular order, not all to my liking, only popular stuff (I know there is avantgarde/indie scene but I have no idea what's going on there):
[Boombox - Your Number/Ivy] (2nd part is using lyrics from a 19 century Ukrainian poet, probably the most known Ukrainian woman)
[Alone in a canoe - I Have No Home] (context: in post-invasion Ukraine a lot of people from the Eastern part of the country had to become internal refugees)
[Dakha Brakha - The Monk]
[Hristina Solovy - Fortepiano]
[Onuka - Vidlik] - Her band's name is literally "Granddaughter" since she's a granddaughter of a locally famous traditional instruments maker
To illustrate production improvements, here's our pop diva Tina Karol in 2011:
And in 2019:
There's something simple and primal yet meaningful about the genre
I like folk from many countries/cultures
I think the sound of bandura holds a special place in Ukrainian folk
[Traditional bandura]
[Modern]
[Contemporary music on bandura]
It's not European, rather international, but I **love** Burger King
I think it is much better then McDonald's
In Ukraine, we either say *"electronic post"* or use the hostname of one of the most popular e-mail services, e.g. Gmail, Ukrnet, (used to be) Yandex, etc
E.g., *"send it to me on Ukrnet/Gmail"* means *"send it to me via e-mail"*. But when I propose to send it via e-mail to you, I use the word "post".
Unrelated, but colloquially people often say *"throw it"* instead of *"send it via electronic means of communication"*.
In Russian, there's also a slightly outdated slang term *"мыло/mylo"* (literally means "soap")
So the phrase *"throw it on my soap"* is universally and unambiguously recognized as *"sent it to my e-mail"*.
Russia
Poland
Austria
Ottomans
I'm not sure about the fifth, really depends on the era we are talking about
Lithuania suddenly appears in 14 hundreds and after the Union of Lublin we never hear about it
Coud be greeks too, leart about their colonies in the northern Black sea and about Byzantium
Poland and Russia (and later the USSR)
Then Lithuania, then Turkey, then Hungary (Austria–Hungary)
Weirdly, but not so much about Belarus
No brother countries here
We've been counting this word/concept as a slur for a while since every country that had claimed to be Ukraine's brother ended up being Russia
We ironically call Russians "dear brothers" (*bratushki*) or "mouse brothers" (*myshe-bratiya*) which is similar in sound with the phrase "but we're brothers" (*my zhe bratiya)* that they like to repeat while twisting their knife in our territorial integrity
We have other countries that have never claimed this "brotherhood" with us but acted as allies, which is a much healthier relationship
Mentality wise, every country that has never led an expansive war has something similar to Ukraine, so we can understand each other better than with former empires and owners of colonies
Poland
Alot of people immigrate there or go to work/study to Poland
Poland
We had some problems in the past, but now we are BFF
Croatia is our Balkan brother
I don't know why but we love each other
Maybe because of pretty similar history
Georgia is our Caucasian brother
Mainly due to the fact that they also suffered from Russian agression
Canada is our brothers, too
There is a huge community of Ukrainians
And they were first country (with Poland) to recognize our independence
Poland is an ally at the moment in addition to being a "career destination". The relationship is indeed weird
Despite the regular reports about the mistreatment from Polish employers, the historical tensions/nationalistic clashes the general opinion on Poland is neutral at least and positive at best
The media never fixates on negativity, IMO
They will write songs about this unbreakable unity based on cheap liquor and cigarettes :)
Lithuania is a great ally :)
We like Belarusians on average, but understand their political situation and peculiarities of their mentality
Yet again, this "brother nation" thing has to give way to just good-natured coexistence
> Now im sad :(
> Me too now
Scandinavian vibes
Oh yeah, learning the language of a country where you live is definitely "ethnic cleansing"
They can learn it
It can be taught as foreign language in school program
Children have to study other subjects on Ukrainian after fifth grade
Northern Bukovina always had Ukrainian majority
So it wasn't "for no reason".
That family has lived in Ukraine for over 70 years, that's 3 generations
They have to know Ukrainian
>According to the Romanian census of 1930, the territory of the future Chernivtsi Oblast had 805,642 inhabitants in that year, out of which 47
6% were Ukrainians, and 28
2% were Romanians
47,6% is not "slightly more" then 28,2%
Dude, do you think I know what was on mind of that madman
I am not justifying him, just wanted to make a point that northern Bukovina had Ukrainian majority and Southern had Romanian
[future husband takes mother in law for a ride in a cart]
on a third day of celebration, few people visit people, that were celebrating previous three days, at home and "steal" chicken (ask politely, but everybody pretends it is a theft)
that evening (almost) all food is made of chicken (mostly in a form of a soup) and everybody eats shared food all of which came from the guests
[description in Ukrainian]
"Ukrainian language is russian polish"- that what i heard mostly from russians
"You guys sound like you are always fighting each other"
Yeah, it's rather derogatory
Ukrainian is Russian Polish, Belarusian is Russian Polish-Lithuanian
Polish is Russian Latin-German, Serban/Croatian are Balkan Russian
Bulgarian is Russian Churchian
Kazakh is Russian can-readian-but-can't-understanian
> Kazakh is Russian cant-readian-but-can't-understanian
They switching to Latin script, so it's become " Kazakh is Russian can't-readian-can't-understanian
Mussolini started off as a socialist before ww1
He was kicked out of the party for being pro war
Thank you, Lithuania, for the consistent support
Wanted to mention you, too, but it's more complicated, and I didn't want to end up throwing shade (this time)
With Lithuania, it feels like they want another equal by their side; Poland's attitude is more like "an enemy of an enemy" or "we're doing charity taking all those Ukrainians in, and they don't even want to completely agree on our take on OUN/UPA", etc
Let's say, thank you, Poland, for Donald Tusk, and for opposing Germany "doing business" with Russia yet again
Yes, this is how I like it
*a small voice in the back of my head*: ^don't ^^screw ^^^it ^^^^up, ^^^^^Ukraine
Well, I'm not perfect, maybe another Ukrainian will thank you better
so do something
As Ukrainian, I know that it's better to keep trying to do something than do nothing and afraid that "next government will be the same or worse".
Yes, I know it
You should keep doing even if there are no other people supporting you
And if you ARE doing something, then I can add nothing except "Best wishes and hold on"

**1)** We had regional elections on October 25
Certain regions have pro-Russian parties leading, but pro-Ukrainian parties also have a decent representation
The most notable news is that the so-called "servants" ("Servant of the People", Zelenskyi 's party) didn't get much
In the parliamentary elections of 2019 all a candidate had to do was to take a "servant" template in the [TM green colour] and place their face on it, and he or she was elected
Yesterday it was almost the opposite
**2)** Another topic is the weather
Today we have +14C which is more typical for late September-early October
The leaves are still mostly green, although the middle of October is supposed to be the traditional golden autumn with bright yellow maples and heaps of fallen foliage, and by early November, we might have had the very first snow
Nah, Slovakia is awesome outside of Old Town of Bratislava
Belarus is pretty interesting imo because it’s sort of a window into what a modern soviet union could look like
As far as I know the government didnt really change things that much after 1991 so all of the state-owned stores and buffets with foods my parents reminisce about are all still there, it’s kinda cool
Also, it has part of Biloveža forest which is pretty old, i’ve never been there though so I don’t know if it’s worth or not
Break a leg
One of the most corrupt countries in Europe to say the least
It is probably [Carol of the bells] it is an Ukrainian traditional song that became popular in the US
In Ukrainian it is called Щедрик
Our spiritual anthem [Молитва за Україну (Prayer for Ukraine)]
They are,but Щедрик is very well know song abroad that has its origin in Ukraine
I don’t know about every country,but I think, that in the US it’s quite popular
First I saw it in “Home Alone” when Kevin was in a church
So that was my first encounter with the American version
Kyiv
Pros:
* A lot of 24/7 services
* services are mostly on every step
* Decent subway
* Greenspaces
* Center of city mostly safe and clean
* Big fucking river in the middle of the city
What I don't like:
* car traffic is terrible
Shitty public transport (except subway)
bad roads
* lack of medium-density housing
* new blocks are ugly, overpriced and unpractical as fuck (like those blocks where can live 4200 people and only 100 parking lots
* Infrastructure constantly breaks
Commieblocks are mostly grey, dirty, and need capital repairs
* Advertising everywhere
* The city doesn't have to unite architecture style, so, for example, old houses in baroque style can  coexist with a house in style "Architectors nightmare "
* Pollution
* The criminal situation also not encouraging for optimism
Zakarpattia Oblast
Basically it is a region that is situated beyond the Carpathians
But we often joke that it is unexplored area and no man knows what inhabits that area
Well, we had only one monarch - [Daniel of Galicia] so we don't have much choice
EDIT: If we count Grand Princes  (and regent-consort, princess-consort and dozens of a princess )  we have next names:
For men : Oleg, Rurik,Askold,Dir, Sviatoslav **,** Vladimir , Sviatopolk , Iziaslav, Yuri and planty of others
For women:  Olga , Anna, Maria,  Ingegerd , Anastasia , Rogneda , Elisaveta   and planty of others
Some would say - should borsch be with smetana (type sour cream) or without
My family have always been cooking a borscht with haricot beans and a little meat
It had felt right but then I met many people who put so much meat in a borscht as they had killed all pigs on Ukraine
Moreover, somebody even treats that borsht with haricot beans like pineapple pizza
Horrible
Jokes aside, there are so many varieties and that's great
However, beans Vs meat is the main war in my area
In the west people tend to argue whether or not they can add lemons or other fruits to borsht to make it sweeter or soirer
I never tasted it
\~ five years ago I liked to eat borsch with a ton of pepper or sauce in it where smetana just not fit in
Now, I prefer simple borsch with smetana
In Ukrainian platypus is "duckbeak" - *"качкодзьоб/kachkodziob"*, which sounds like a more specific "ptakopysk". Like, which "ptakh"? A duck
Which type of "pysok"? A beak
Apparently, a loanword from Ukrainian :)
I suspect, it's [Kazka - Плакала \(Cry\)]
It's a song about tough women's fate of sitting at the kitchen and crying but then standing up and "blooming like a violet again".
There was a 90s singer Tatiana Bulanova singing about being a single mother and rocking her son to sleep while he's crying and calling for the dad - the same thing, but this time a Ukrainian singer
When *Kazka - Плакала* came out a couple of years ago, you didn't even have to own a device to listen to it - you could just open up your balcony, and there was some dude playing it loudly from another balcony
Or you could go outside and hear it playing from a kiosk
Or you could take a bus and hear it playing from the driver's cabin
Or you could go to a forest or riverside and hear it playing from where some people were having a picnic
Or you could go to a governmental institution and hear it playing as someone's ringtone
As a proper earworm, the song had covers, parodies, etc
It was later discovered that the lead singer was a [less than ideal] live performer (she had some kind of stage anxiety and couldn't control her voice since she was not professionally trained)
So many people were gleeing while cancelling her, because, apparently, people can't handle someone's success for too long
(*Kazka's [Apart] is a great song though*)
But if you want a decent Marc Dacascos-style comeback, here's [a more recent] live performance
I think it was Jamala or Tina Karol who helped her with the vocals
Dude, fuckin true
That one song by ONUKA that was in a Vodafone commercial also counts
I forgot the name
Do Bulgarians understand the lyrics or was it more like a catchy tune when the lyrics don't matter
You're right, especially the part with the guy playing the buhai

What's the most well known videogame from your country
Tell a couple if you can
In Ukraine, it's definitely S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Fantastic series
Apart from S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:
Ubisoft Kyiv helps with development of Ubi games
Also, Plarium has a big office in Kharkiv, so Raid: Shadow Legends is partly Ukrainian
Metro 2033/Last Light/Exodus
Sherlock Holmes series
Cossacks
I used to watch my dad play them
Could not think of a game more fondly tbh
Baba is You is pretty cool
Arkane also has that cool ass return to ravenholm game

Zhyvchik
^ Basically it is an apple lemonade
There are also other flavors like pear, lime, cherry, orange, but apple is the most popular
You can also buy zhyvchik without gas, but it will be just an ordinary apple juice
[Kvas] Kvas is a fermented drink made out of rye bread
There are a lot of different flavors of it in Ukraine(orange, mint and strawberry, blackberry), but they all suck ass imo
* **Kvas** - both as a [storebought carbonated drink] and more [traditional drink] made with bread
It's a less offensive relative of beer with a tiny bit of alcohol content from fermenting
It's also sweet and a little sour, with a hint of dried fruits
Basically, what all kids imagine when they see adults getting and drinking [cold, foamy] beer
* [**Живчик/Zhyvchyk**] - apple soda with 1 ml of apple juice to justify its mentioning in the ingredients
Tastes not as sweet and artificial as other apple sodas though
Actually, it tastes a lot like water-diluted carbonated apple juice
There's also [pear, lemon, and orange] Zhyvchyk which also consist of ~1 ml of juice
IMO, the lemon one is better than Sprite or 7UP, but in general, they're not too different from other similar sodas
* [**Узвар/uzvar**] - a drink made with boiled [dried fruit] - apple, pear, plum, raisins
* [**Кисіль/kysil**] - a drink made with water, potato starch, fresh or preserved fruit, berries, rhubarb, sweetbrier berries, etc
Definitely English

Used to love milk when I lived in the village, there was real milk from cows, not this "milk like drink" which is sold in our shops
Usual milk is too sweet for me, so I prefer vegan (wheat) one
Though I only add it to meat/salad/coffee, I'm not drinking it on it's own
у чорта на рогах / at devils horns , "at the ass of the world ".
Surprisingly we describe the middle of nowhere as city of Kryžopoľ cause it sounds like bent arse
«Раз-два-три-чотири-п‘ять, я йду [усіх вас] шукать». (One-two-three-four-five, I'm going to look for you all)
But we also used russian «Кто не спрятался, я не виноват». (Ready or not, here I come)
"Кто не спрятался, я не виноват!" (Who didn't hide, I am not guilty
It's direct translation can be missunderstood
It means "If somebody didn't hide, it's not my fault"
Ну вообще то да вы правильно перевели, просто в русском фраза звучит как два отдельных не связанных предложения. Мы такие вещи понимаем, а носители английского не знаю.
Lol we too
Sorry, if late but like What
I don't know who you talked to about Romania and Moldavia uniting and it's bothering us
Where did you hear it
I never heard about us hating you because of it
For me it's like first time
Well,it's okay lol with covid 19 right now don't forget about your health too:)
Funny reason though xD
Kite is "змій/zmiy" which is a serpent or a dragon
There's [Zmiy Gorynych] a fairytale creature which is essentially a dragon
Dragon is "дракон/drakon", a more common name
I was today years old when I realized it
When I was in the Blue Mosque I first saw an American lady tell her kids that taking of their shoes is unnecessary (she was standing under the sign that says it's necessary)
Later, in the main hall, I saw Chinese tourists knocking on columns to check if they are real and taking photos of praying people with flash on (BTW these praying people were women from some radical Islam movement)
Russian
Basically mostly every Ukrainian can understand, speak, and write in Russian freely
Russian
It is even more popular than the country's national language, Ukrainian
For many citizens Russian is first language
Yes, I moved for studies in 2014 to Poland and haven’t returned back since
However, I am planning to move to another western country once the opportunity arises
In Ukraine we have two names for railroad: "Kolija" which means train track and "Zaliznytsya", which means whole railroad infrastructure
Yes, every time you go mushrooming in an unknown area, you have a chance to go too deep into the forest where the GPS just shows green in every direction
In this case, you need to find some road (with a map or by listening) and head towards it to see some roadsigns, ask the bypassers in cars or even hitchhike
I've been in similar situations
Despite the part of the forest I was in was maintained (some sand roads, no wild suppling undergrowth under older trees, etc
), the forest was still vast and looked the same everywhere
We were trying to head towards the railroad, but in a forest like this, the sound travels weirdly
We ended up walking away from the railroad
One time we went to the forest, and I jokingly pointed out where the north is based on moss on the trees
Hours later we were trying to get back and were kinda walking in circles
Ended up checking the moss on trees and this is how we were able to walk straight
Yes, area around Chernobyl
Basically, when human activity ceased, animals returned
Bears, deer, wolves, all of them are now in plenty there
Shame 5% of forest was affected in recent fires
We also have wild boars coming to people's fields in the countryside
They're smart and know how to dig under fences to get those free snacks
Oh yes, our primary school classes called "nature-knowledge" (Nature science
) finally pay off
There's a clearly visible road SW of that point less than 1 mile away lol
Most people I know don't even read newspapers
Probably no one
We didn't have friends as we were always kinda oppressed by almost all of our neighbours :(
Yep, didn't have time to form a country as Poland and Russia always fucked us over, then Germans came
Although Austria and Hungary,they were the best out of all the oppressors
Edit: but now it's a time to make good friends
Well, we are friends(and a good ones :)) but certainly not the oldest form of friendship like was stated in the post
Well, we are good friends with them but I can't say that we are close to each other for example like Lithuania and Latvia I'd say
This kind of bond with our circumstances back n the days was difficult to make
Well, Belarus more like a family
Yes, I know that,so if what I wrote was too salty sorry then
Can you please list then some of things and occasions where we oppressed them
I know ukrainians have done some bad things to Poles but i don't think there was a time where we had much more power than Poland
It's okay, you didn't sound mean, more like rational :) I didn't see your flair when I was writing a response, so I can see why it was more or less perceived in a bad light
Nope, I am tired enough with the inner permanent political shitstorm and I don't want to dive into another one
Since our politics and life in the country heavily depends on (especially) Russia, Poland, USA and EU in general, I personally find it hard to be completely ignorant what's going in there
Indeed, that's a big problem in our country
80%-90% percent of kids start to smoke at 13 and drink at 14
That's illegal in my country, but shops rarely follow this law
Even some teachers at schools just ignoring smoking and drinking kids
Ukrainian made indie games, bought few games but never played in them since i don't have much time for videogames now
"Як скажеш"[Yak skazhesh], which means "As you say" or "As you wish"
People usually have one first name and one last name
People with a hyphenated first or last name aren't common, but they do exist
* The structure of an average person's name:
Name (e.g., Mariya) + Patronymic derived from the father's name ([daughter] of Petro --> Petrivna) + Last Name (Moroz)
= Mariya Petrivna Moroz or Moroz Mariya Petrivna
The last name comes first or last in order
Usually, if it's for practical purposes, we announce the last name first, and when it's used in natural speech, the first name comes first
In Ukraine we first write our family name, then our first name and a patronymic (father’s name plus suffix)
Many people also have their baptism name, but it it is not used officially
You're right, female patronymics usually end with **-ivna** (Petrivna) and male - with **-ovych** (Petrovych)
Grammatically patronymics are adjectives (I guess
) and must agree with the first name in gender, number, and case
E.g.,
Nominative: Mariya Petrivna, Danylo Petrovych
Genitive: Mariyi Petrivny, Danyla Petrovycha
Dative: Mariyi Petrivni, Danylovi Petrovychu
and so on
You're welcome
That Cnornobyl is next to Kyiv and he was worried to get radiation poisoning
“A bit” In British English would mean that
Don’t ask what hui means in Slavic languages

At least you have the fucking balls to say it
That's Polish actually
Thank Putin for that
It's not free, it's financed from taxes - it's long waiting times (not in an emergency case), doctors can treat you like shit (you will still come back to them), treatment quality can be low and more harmful than the disease, doctors get a lower wage
I think universal healthcare should function alongside private medicine and get proper financing, that's the perfect balance
Will, will Will will Will Will's will

I've been learning English for 12 years in school and kindergarten, and still not sure what tenses in certain situations I should use
Whatever the fuck was happening in Yugoslavia during it's collapse
I've got no idea who the sides of the conflict were(apart from "Serbs dislike Croats and Bosniaks and it's mutual") and why where they fighting in the first place apart from partitioning Yugoslavia
It's been 2 years, and many Ukrainians still can't believe we've elected a pantless muppet to be the president
Are you heavily Orthdox
You love Easter
You're crazy for Easter
Are you anything else
You love the New Year
Christmas was banned in Soviet times
To substitute, people celebrated the New Year
It's still a big holiday to this day
AFAIK it's either Odessa or the area near Carpathians, like Lviv or Ivano-Frankivsk
If the state is commonly mentioned in pop culture, then most people are familiar with the name
If there's a specific city mentioned as well, people know the city
Sometimes those things aren't connected, like, people know Las Vegas, Chicago, or New Orleans but not the states those cities are in
Although, they know those are the US cities
That's the very basic knowledge
Other people might be familiar with more states and where they're on the map
Not precisely, more like, is it in the north or south, does it have a shore, and so on
You never know what exactly the person in front of you knows, have they been to the US themselves or if they have relatives there so they know stuff secondhand
But it's safe to assume people outside of the US know it better than the US Americans themselves know the outside world
Which one
Same for any language, mate
I mean, Polish wouldn't be so hard, if you were growing up speaking Russian and Ukrainian as your mother tongues
I would be because it would really benefit my country
Let us in
Same
Polish is already more popular in Ireland than Irish
That’s SAD
Yeah
However I think efforts are not enough
I mean Israel managed to resurrect hebrew
Why isn’t Ireland not as successful in brining Gaelic back
I hope basque language would be preserved
It’s the only one pre-indoeuropean language of Europe alive
Extra senses and REN tv just had the biggest bullshit
It's pretty good, but still not as big and detailed as the English one
So I use both - depending on the topic
No, it's not

"It's cold put on a warmer jacket/hat and don't forget the gloves"
"Where's your warm hat
This hat isn't warm enough"
"You have lost weight, do you eat at all
"You'll see when you have your own child"
Funny to here about warm hat, because winters here is kinda warm
e.g. +9 today in Kyiv
same
hey
Yeah, but mom phrases mutate and adjust themselves in unusual situations
Now that it's so unusually warm, I need a warm hat anyway because *"you're so thin, do you eat at all
You don't have any fat to keep you warm"*.
Oh i remembered about when it’s cold but you wear light clothes mom always says: “It’s not may month outside”
Yes, I've heard this one, too
Also *"fair heat breaks no bones"* (unlike cold), which always sounded weird to me since fever gives body aches alright
Here, in Ukraine, parents of grandparents always keep saying this :)
I’m about an elevator
Yes, Ukrainian pronunciation is close to the spelling, as long as you can hear some minuscule nuances
E.g., "*чолові****ч****а/cholovi****ch****a*" (of a man; adjective; the f. gender) and "*піврі****чч****я/pivri****chchi****a*".
We can pronounce written Russian perfectly except for stress
Writing a word after hearing it is not a sure thing, but mostly you can do it too
My dad calls it "*where the king goes to without his entourage*".
Russian has *сральник* - sralnik
Ukrainian *сральник* - sralnyk
Срач means a mess in Russian
The word "Palyanytsya" (a type of  Ukrainian bread made from wheat flour ) - basically the easiest way ([Shibboleth] to identify Russian, because, despite the similarity between ukranian and russian words, russians would say somesthing like Palyanitsa
Ukrainians (as well as Belarusians and Russians) have been watching a lot of telenovelas since the 90s. Many people, even younger ones, might take interest in the lives of the actors from these series
Some titles are meme-like, but with respect to its cultural significance :
* Escrava Isaura (Isaura: Slave Girl)
* Los ricos también lloran (The rich also cry)
* Rosa salvaje (Wild Rose)
* Simplemente María (Simply María)
* Dynasty
* Dallas
* Santa Barbara
* Muñeca brava (Wild Angel)
* O Clone (The Clone)
* Muhteşem Yüzyıl (The Magnificent Century)
Some people believe that our blue-yellow flag should be yellow-blue instead
This conspiracy theory (let's call it so) has gained so much traction it even has a [WIKI page]
In fact, the flag was yellow-blue [at some point in history] but the order doesn't really matter, because blue and yellow are two state colours, not a scheme for wheat and sky or water and fire, or something like that
Many Ukrainians have Cossack nicknames as surnames
A bunch of dudes were living in steppes, in a self-governing free state, practicing martial arts, giving each other nicknames like "Break-the-oak" or "Speckled-butt", and then those nicknames have become surnames for their descendants
One day you're *u\/tasty_dino_meat* on Reddit, and a couple of centuries later you have a proud dynasty of Tastydinomeats next to surnames like Smith and Ericsson (in our case, Ivanchenko and Kovalchuk)
In Ukraine, there is an organization called "Plast". They are more close to American scouts, I think, but they also get brainwashed with religious bullsh*t.

It's not bad, but I only gave it a second chance since it's one of my favourite bands
Can't really recommend it to the people I know since it has folk lyrics + whatever genre of music + obscenities = not everybody's cup of tea, but it sounds good to me
That it is insulting to get called Russian as a Ukrainian
I feel you brother
Especially with the conflict going on between Russia and my country, it’s insulting x10 when people go “ooh Ukraine and Russia
Same shit”
We can relate
Yup hahaha

Btw, i can distinguish Russian , Ukrainian and Belorussian easily
I can’t explain how, but this works so accurate
"Каак пагодка в Маааскве?"
It's usually a one-way thing
We and Belarusians can smell out Russians a mile away, they usually have a hard time telling even a Lithuanian apart
LMAO
You can hear russian strong voice
They are speaking too hard, seems like rude
Moscow
i didnt see any but i heard  **Kropyvnytskyi**  is the borignest place on the planet
At least it has a sea
There are a lot of towns similar to it in Eastern Ukraine without anything fun at all like Kramatorsk or Kamianske
Then better start with Kyiv or Lviv
Never been there but yes there are really cool places at/near Carpathians
Totally, it also has lots of cool bars and restaurants
It has it's charm
Also lots of country's best restaurants
Worth visiting
Everything
It is easier to name all that is more expensive

We call flip-flops "vyetnamki" - Vietnamese
The word for Belarus in Norwegian is more correct than in English

Absolutely love it
Watch "Servant of the people" . It isn't a movie, but a series made by our current president Zelensky, at the time when he wasn't our president, and it's about his character being our president
I don't suppose there are a lot of Ukrainians here, so here goes
Cyborgs
It's not a masterpiece per se, but it offers our perspective on the war we still have going, if that's interesting
Anyone who is patriotic, want to defend the country till the end and don't want to make compromises with the aggressor would do
Someone take Zelensky away, please
Yeah, pretty much
I didn't like him from the start, but most people loved him
Now his approval rating is only half the figures he got after the elections and citizens start to hate him
The exact same situation happens in Ukraine every time after elections
Someone wins elections, the next year he is the enemy of the people
It's wonder me we have some our words sounds similar in Dutch
For ex
Cukor = Цукор ( sounds like Tscukor, means sugar) in Dutch suiker; Дах ( sounds like Dach, means roof) in Dutch dak

Sorry don't follow them
But met such in UA and in Sk, especially near the border

Revolution, Independence, Bolshevik occupation and terrorism
We've got our independence, and Russians are even more salty now
We have a country now
Well Poland fucking betrayed us and made peace with the soviets making us lose independence and get absolutely fucked for 70 more years
Dude
If Bolshevik Ukraine was independently governed from Kyiv, I could agree
But it was governed by Russian Bolsheviks from Moscow
More to say, in 30's all pro-Ukrainian Bolsheviks were killed
Hitler was an Austrian
Why do we blame Germany for Nazi atrocities
The same as we don't blame Georgia for Stalin and Ukraine for Khrushchov
Fun fact: the strongest wave of Russianization in Ukraine came when Khrushchov got the power
Ukrainian history as a whole
Most people outside of Ukraine itself know almost nothing about our history, often conflating it with russian one
In Ukraine we have village called Яр, which translates as ravine
Only 4 people live there
I had read the Lord of the Rings long time ago in Russian and this name was tranlated like "Torbins". They just translated the meaning of the name and keep English-style surname
For me it is good
More foreign
Sad, but it can be rebuilded after all
Yeah, I'm bilingual, like everybody else, but have tried to speak both languages instead of having one dominant (Russian) and the other one sounding too artificial/formal since it was the language of my education (Ukrainian)
But my friends (also fully bilingual people) protested when I tried to speak Ukrainian to them because they were weirded out by the personality shift
Every predominantly Russian speaking Ukrainian has a lot of Ukrainian words, phrases and jokes in Ukrainian inserted in their speech
I see it as neon yellow verbal highlighter used to make some parts of the speech more expressive
Same happens with Russian phrases in Ukrainian, but to a lesser extent, and people have no problem with that
But the full-on switch from one code to another is, apparently, too much
Something similar happened to my coworker who used to hear me speaking Ukrainian most of the time
On one occasion I started replying in Russian, and she said something like "why do you make me walk this uncanny valley
I don't know, because I completely quit Russian language which was my first language in childhood
But I don't think that my body language changed since then
I surely swear less, don't drink vodka anymore, and even don't pray to tsar, - but I believe it's about self-development and education, not language switch
>But my friends (also fully bilingual people) protested when I tried to speak Ukrainian to them because they were weirded out by the personality shift
>Something similar happened to my coworker who used to hear me speaking  Ukrainian most of the time
On one occasion I started replying in  Russian, and she said something like "why do you make me walk this  uncanny valley
I also got gigs like this, from both sides, when switched to Ukrainian completely
However, I believe it's about the image of the personality and its radical lingual shift, not some real changes of body language whatsoever
This is a good point
Edit: wanted to add that my Ukrainian vocab is a little more pretentious/bookish/flowery, and Russian is more relaxed/casual
Also, my tone of voice is slightly lower in Ukrainian because it drops to the chest
It seems like for me, there is some shift in personality or self-expression after all
No, most people don't speak any foreign language or speak just enough to ask for a dry towel in Turkey or haggle with an equally not-speaking-English Egyptian seller of trinkets
So like A1 tops
Some people are slightly ashamed of their helplessness abroad, so they come home and put some effort into English
Language schools, apps, Youtube channels and textbooks are always in demand
But since those people don't have enough stimulus at home, this initiative dies off after a couple month
So when someone actually speaks a foreign language decently, people react [like this] It's like being lazy and out of shape and then finding it in you to get in shape - some willpower has been put in it, and it gets the thumbs up
That's very weird
Almost everyone in Kiev can speak Russian if they choose to
Most importantly, absolutely everyone understands Russian
Source: am a Russian-speaking Ukrainian
But sometimes people can just be rude and speak Ukrainian even if you don't understand it at all
Witnessed this behaviour myself from an employee at an airport(!), who yelled at two clueless Israeli guys in Ukrainian
Felt ashamed of my countrymen
Russian isn't a foreign language
For historical reasons, most Ukrainians are fully bilingual (with one of the languages being the primary one)
However, we don't study Russian at school and it doesn't have the official status
>is Russian ability slowly shrinking
No, but since 2014, many bilingual people that used to speak Russian for convenience are now speaking Ukrainian and try to teach the kids to speak it as the language of choice
>And do Ukrainians think of Russian as one of (behind Ukrainian) "their" languages, or as the language of the invader
I don't know if you're in the mood for a long read, but here's a shorter answer: we think of Russian as of a native language, unless you ask a particularly nationalistic person (which we as Ukrainians have any right to be)
But most people tend to separate the language from the country
Putin himself, however, has said that Russia is everywhere people speak Russian
It's an ideological weapon and a propaganda tool of the so-called [Russkiy Mir] (the Russian World), so we need to be conscious and aware of its destructive powers
Depends on the region
I live in  oneof  the most Russian-speaking cities
My native language is absolutely Russian, not Ukrainian
Same goes for most of people here
People in the middle of the country mostly speak "surzhik", which is a mix of the two
People in the west speak Ukrainian and don't consider Russian their mother tongue
However, everyone in every region understands both languages, and having a conversation where each person speaks their mother tongue is very common
Putin is an oligarch and criminal authority
He's as set as one can get robbing a huge territory rich in oil, natural gas, diamonds, wood, etc for 20 years
And now his main objective is not to be prosecuted
He uses a fraction of these treasures to keep many politicians in the EU and in Asia in his pocket
Propaganda, threats and money work much better than niceties and good manners
We have a saying which we sometimes say to our visitors:
"feel yourself at home but don't forget that you're a guest".
It's a joke that has some didactic undertones
So e.g. if someone stays overnight, they're allowed to feel themselves at home, use the shower (gels, shampoos, etc
), walk around in a robe or pajamas, open the fridge and cupboards, make themselves a sandwich, use and wash the dishes, etc
The main meal like breakfast, lunch, or dinner is usually discussed so everyone knows which ingredients are for the cooking and what is being planned, so they don't just snack but adjust to the eating habits of the house (i.e., don't take what they like from the fridge)
Unless they're that kind of guests or really close friends that you've known for years, visitors aren't allowed to sneak around checking what's up
If they want to take something from the fridge, they just ask
No, basically every name that you want, probably except Hitler or something
Same for surnames
My colleague had gone to Stockholm a few weeks before us and told us Vasa wasn't really all that interesting and we could skip going there
When my husband and I still decided to go in, we were absolutely in awe of that beautiful ship and the way exhibition was built around it
To see such an amazing artifact is a rare feat and we spent several hours there on our short weekend trip
Skansen was great as well
I thought that Portugal was in South America
I don't remember, why
Maybe (just maybe) I thought that Portugal was a region within Brazil that gave the name to the language, just like Latin that comes from the Latium region, and then it went independent
...that Finland used to be one of the Soviet Republics (within the USSR), and that's why some Finns occurred in Russian movies speaking Russian with an accent, just like the Baltic countries nationals
Also, the fact that Bulgaria wasn't a part of the USSR was very confusing, because it was always talked of as if it was
...that common Frauen und Herren were unaware the Nazis were exterminating undesirable ethnicities in the Third Reich
I didn't know that [the Great Patriotic War] that started in 1941 wasn't exactly the same war as WWII that started in 1939
Also, every Ukrainian child learns that the geographical centre of Europe is in Ukrainian Transcarpathia
I didn't know there was/is [a competition]

I like the most blaser Lille e Rose from Blasercafe as I understand
But where I live(Kharkiv) we have SOOO many good places that sell coffee,mixes and blasers so understandably there probably a lot better ones

If you love coffee and in Kharkiv, you are in for a treat, seriously
Й, і = and
В, у = in
З = with, from
А = but
О = at (time)

Yeah, most of the prepositions are one-letter
Since the level of income might be dramatically different, people tend to be careful
But within the circle of colleagues it is not a taboo
I'll say that green are more popular, usually, I see black olives only on pizza
At the moment, unfortunately, our presidential party has a majority in parliament (248 out of 424) so we don't have the balance at all
But at least parliament and president were elected in a democratic way
It only causes problems and conflicts
Pro-Russian folks get really annoyed when Ukrainian language is spoken near them
Edit: I was born and live in Kharkiv (an almost 100% Russian-speaking city) and I like the laws supporting Ukrainian language, if someone's interested
It's 50/50 from what I've seen when I was traveling around Ukraine
In some places, it's almost 100% Russian, in some places it's 100% Ukrainian and in some the languages are mixed, like in Kyiv
Yes, quite well actually
The literature here thst was written in say about 13-15 century is wuite easy to read if you speak Ukrainian
>the word for door is always plural in Slovak
*"It's plural in Ukrainian too"*, I thought to myself, *"so why don't we
"*. And then I recalled, it's singular (and feminine) in Russian, so there's no clash in our minds
As for your question, the classic is "how do you feel yourself
" (i.e., how do you feel
In Ukrainian, it's "*як почуваєшСЯ/yak pochuvayeshSIA*" (a reflexive verb)
In Russian, it's "*как себя чувствуешь/kak sebia chuvstvuyesh"* (a transitive verb + reflexive pronoun)
Same in Russian
Those are rather narrow linguistic terms, so no shame in not knowing them
I only hope I get it right
A transitive verb requires an object, e.g., *to open [what
] a door*. Same in Russian, *открыть [что?] дверь*.
An example of an intransitive verb would be "to grow" as in "grass grows".
Reflexive pronouns are *yourself, myself,* etc
>is an average Ukrainian fluent in Russian
Sure, I thought it was common knowledge
De jure Ukrainian is the only state language, de facto in private life everyone uses the language they like
Do you use the calque OP mentioned
I.e.
>Slovaks say they "opened the doors"
[Yep] We have one
We got it in 2016, so a lot of people have a passport and not ID card
In Ukraine we have a biometric [ID Card]  which came in place of old Soviet style internal passports
Similar to countries in the EU, the card does allow some international travel including Turkey, Moldova, Georgia and Russia
Well, I like it too, it's a common feature among passports that it has blue-yellow theme:)
I also can distinguish between Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, and I'm not of an East Asian ethnicity
They just look different, although, sometimes there's a bland of features
Same for Europeans - they just look different, and it's not only about biology or fashion sense; people of the same nationality often have similar facial expressions
My theory, keeping the same set of facial expressions for years influences your facial muscles
Obviously, I have the highest success rate with Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians, and there's a difference between these three which I can't explain, it's just a hunch
Then there are Poles and Czechs
Their faces are "Ukrainian" but longer and more angular
E.g., an average Ukrainian face of a male is oval with a tendency to an upside-down egg, the nose is rounded and the cheeks are puffy
A Polish dude also has an oval face, but this upside-down egg has a cleft chin or more pronounced cheekbones
A Czech dude's face is an upside-down egg with two yolks, and the nose is pointy
Then there're Germans whose faces are rectangular or square, with a wide but short chin
If it's a quite similar face, but narrower, with a longer chin and overall smaller features, I suspect an Austrian
Everything above is subjective and only applicable to ethnic majorities of the aforementioned countries
When it comes to facial expressions, I can't put this feeling into words
Definitely not in Odesa
The best ones are surprisingly near Mariupol in the East
Good, clean beaches and nobody's there, since it's quite close to the war zone (yet completely safe)
"History of Ukraine" seems to only exist in Ukraine, right
Yeah, from my experience with this sub, having two different subjects  covering home history and history of other countries is uncommon
That's why we know their history but they're not sure where we're on the map
IIRC, even in Russia they only have one
Also, fundamentals of law (правознавство) or astronomy (астрономія) which is like physics, but in space
And ОБЖД (fundamentals of safety)
As for subject that don't exist in Ukraine, I'd say, it's religion
If there's even such subject, it's extracurricular and voluntary
We have  "History of Ukraine" and "World History" ( or "Foreign History") as separate subjects
At least it was like when i was in school, and that was more than a decade ago
Sorry for the late answer
When I was in school, he was showcased as a national hero and so on
But the eventual consequences of the Pereyaslav Council with Russia wasn't mentioned, as i remember
In general, he has a rather positive view here rather than a negative, but he is criticized for union with Russia and someone also criticizes his alliance with Crimean Tatars (we weren't friends back in those days) - both alliances didn't end well for Ukrainians
Yes, as for example:
Russia:  Ukranian-Soviet war ( 1917–21),  Holodomor (great famine in 1932-1933), UPA status
From recent - Crimea and Donbass
Poland: all differences are mostly about views on UPA and Bandera
That not  exhaustive list, though
*sort comments by controversial*
The Great Patriotic War (1941-45) was essentially equated with WWII, and the USSR almost single-handedly won this war
Lots of memorials and common graves in every town and village with those two dates:
* *1941-1945 will not forget, will not forgive*
Also, the famous [Molotov's speech] from 22
1941
> Today at 4 o'clock a.m., without any claims having been presented to the Soviet Union, without a declaration of war, German troops attacked our country, attacked our borders at many points and bombed from their airplanes our cities
Edit: I expand on the parent reply explaining how the concept of WWII was replaced with the Great Patriotic War in the USSR and how it was presented to the public
It's a historical fact, not my own POV
It's not "some Russians". For the vast majority of Russians, Katyn either didn't happen or it was justified
Yes, I have a box dedicated to my home clothes that include summer and winter items as well as clothes intended for doing maintenance work (e.g., painting a surface) or going to a forest
Those clothes are regularly washed just like the rest of the wardrobe, it's just they're not as presentable or fitting, etc
Second-tier clothes
When I was younger and we didn't have many items of clothing, home clothes were the ruined ones, with persistent stains or holes; now I just buy some soft linen/viscose/fleece items from thrift stores and wear them at home
Not everyone uses them
Yeah, it's even called "Putin - Fucker"
More like "Putin - Dickhead"
Also many of our folk songs or marches are about fighting Polish, Russians or Bolsheviks (Even older version of national anthem had lyrics about borders from River Sian to River Don, which are in Poland and Russia respectively at the moment)
Sunce slobode sada nam sviće
Yeah, or even from River Sian to Caucasus Mountains
"Зробились ми великої години"?
To be fair, I can't say these songs are really popular
The closest I can think of are the newer songs about the war and about our enemies
I think those songs might be slightly, just slightly, offensive
Al' jedan je Mauzer
Vi ste hrabri momci
I play mostly The New Order for hoi iv
Vyatka is pretty fun
Or Burgundian System Komi
In Ukraine it's a village near Kyiv called Петропавлівська Борщагівка (Petropavlivśka Borščahivka), which is 25 letters long, so not that long compared to all the others in this thread
Петропавлівська Борщагівка.
The village is located near Kyiv and it's name consists of 25 letters
[Mezhyhirya] an absolutely filthy rich place that formerly belonged to Yanukovich, now it's a museum
140 ha with a yacht pier, an equestrian club, a shooting range, a tennis court, a private zoo, an automobile museum, a golf course, an ostrich farm, a barge, a dog kennel, and a private zoo
And all this for one man, built on the money of Ukrainian taxpayers
And inside it is just more filthy rich than outside, museum of corruption if you want
America finally gave everyone an opportunity to die in a f***ing world war
Thank you
You should probably dismantle a couple more armor brigades as a response to this
[Hmmm
[I am Ukraïnian]
Definitely Russia
They were always the enemy and they will always be
Never understood why you hate the Danish
What about an "ugly sleazy Anglo-Saxons"? That is what your TV tells  your people every fucking day :)
Coincidence
I don't think so
They have the NAVY on the North, you have oil
Statistics fail sometimes :)
I know it's hard for Russians not insulting people for their jokes but can you try to do it sometimes
Money is money
I think this is something similar to Ukrainian "Puzata Hata", this means "paunchy house"
A Ukrainian quasitraditional song became a widely know Christmas song after translating into English
Guess, what's the song
We call it Шпаргалка - shpargalka - which comes from some Polish word
Also, there's бомба - bomb - which means pre-solved task
and also "shpora" means "a spur". Similarity is coincidental
Makes sense
Your typical shpargalka looks like that
No lockers, only backpacks only hardcore
But seriously, there was time where I watched a lot of American films and decided to ask school for lockers as well but nothing came out of it ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
One of the largest country in Europe, but in the same time one of the weakest in economic degree
&#x200B;
Edit:"weakest in economic degree", not "poorest economic degree"
we have biggest and longest queues of russianspeakings on border crossing points into UA on east
It's not poor, rather weak
People here allow themselves to plunder
Top on kindness
what about snow this year
oldest in Britain
Better now, then never
At least we fuck that russian commies, in order most part of Europe can evolve
brave was on both sides
But that is not enough
fuck any Communist and Fascist Party
Ukraine, Norway, Italy, Croatia looks great
People have accents and melodies from their native languages, and after they've managed to acquire a native-like pronunciation, their sentences may retain bits of their native grammar or vocab
Also, non-native speakers use fewer idiomatic phrases like, I don't know
See, sometimes it's easier for me as a non-native speaker to just describe something than to use an idiomatic phrase
E.g., I know what "old as the hills" means, but if I didn't, I'd say "very old". It's still correct, but less metaphoric/more precise
Online it also works vice versa, when you know an idiom from your native language, and someone writing in English uses a calque of this idiom
E.g., to feed with promises
Do you understand the meaning
Yes
Do I understand it's a calque of an idiom
Also yes
And so I suspect this person is not a native English speaker
Offtop: Just add **?t=1m45s** or **?t=105** (where 105 is a number of seconds since start) to the link
How did you differentiate them from a Spanish or Portuguese person
They use the same word for "driver". Also, the Italian language has the same cognate "conducente".
You "make the oaktree" or "throw out the shoes" or "glue [together] the flippers". No biting
Corruption and ignorance of most part of people to an active conflict with Russia in eastern part of country
[KAZKA - Плакала] is still very popular
Any track from [Alyona Alyona]
Unfortunately music in Ukrainian language isn't very popular in Ukraine itself, so there are not so many popular tracks, that I can think of
we already have east vs west but Budjak on the enthnic map looks like its own Balkans
Donetsk, Lugansk and Crimea were, but they're already little out
I'd say it's either southern Bessarabia with all those ethnicities, or Azov sea coast, same
Maybe, Hutsulshchyna
but Ukrainians Bulgarians Romanians Gagauzians Russians and Albanians in such small peice of land is crazy
Budjak is a better name than South Bessarabia IMO
I wholeheartedly agree
Running away from the Ottoman Empire,many are descendants of sailors  who worked in Odessa
This is our alive meme, song about erotic things
Lotta singers in our country make crap music
Like Oleg Vynnik, for example
Literally only 14 year old instagrammer girls who think they have a good taste in music and middle-aged single women listen to his songs
I really like ours, even though it's kinda desperate and we are always on the brink of death or dying, but the lyrics are very inspiring
How we are never going to give up on our country and will kill our enemies in spite of everything
It reminds me of some books, where a hero is going against fate, so it's probably sounds a little clichéd but I like it
I like the melody, but I think that the lyrics are too patriotic
It depends on the season
In winter we mostly have imported apples and some late/hard local apples - 2-5 varieties altogether
In summer-autumn, the assortment also includes local seasonal apples with soft and juicy apple meat
At least 5 varieties of apples altogether, but usually more
**Winter apples:**
* [Semerenko] - they might look like Granny Smith, but they're much harder and much sourer, not very juicy
This variety is rich in iron and can be stored through the whole cold season
* [Granny Smith]
* [Golden] - apparently, called Golden Delicious, but here they're known as just Golden
An imported variety and available throughout the year
* [Red chief] - hard sweet apples available in winter
* [Ligol] - great winter apples; juicy, sour and sweet, medium-hard
* [Champion] - they're sweet and mushy, with a hint of sourness
Can be stored in winter
* [Idared] - big and not very hard apples, sweet with a hint of sour, tour potato-ish in winter
* [No-name] - there's also this variety of apples that is medium or small in size and might look decent, but they taste as a cellar smells
**Summer-autumn apples:**
* all of the above
* [Doneshta] - a local summer variety; one of the best apples - they're often huge, juicy, mushy but not soft and taste with a hint of vanilla
* [Bilyi nalyv] - WIKI translates it as White Transparent
An early apple variety which is very common in Ukraine
It's a stray cat of apples, rather small and juicy, grows everywhere including forests
* [Glory to winners] known as Glory ("Слава/Slava") - another great summer variety, juicy and mostly sour, but with some sweetness and, just like Doneshta, a hint of vanilla
* [Gala] - small-ish sweet apples available through the whole autumn
* [Gloster] - great autumn apples, sour/sweet and juicy, that are hard enough to be stored in winter, but they turn into potatoes rather quickly
yes, I just got inspired to write a lengthy reply about apples, don't judge, you'll understand one day
lol
Green ("white filling", usually from east), red (usually from Karpaty and near Romania) and hybrid (apple + pear etc
Coming down from mountainside
I'm surprised that you guys still use a word "walkie-talkie". I thought it's left in 2000's. :)
As for Ukrainian, can't tell
We have a developed system of diminution, so literally every word (even verbs) can be transformed in "childish" forms
Also, some coutry-side dialects sound a bit childish to my ear
I believe that's because Russian influenced urban Ukrainian a lot - and Russian is much a gruffer language
In Ukrainian  for me it's word "pig" with a 'village' dialect
Normally it's 'свиня' but with dialect it's 'пацє' and that's so funny to me
We do the in Ukrainian
Same in Hebrew
Apple - tapuah (תפוח)
Potato - tapuah adama(תפוח אדמה)
Adama means earth/ground
Not a native, but articles
They are so hard to use correctly
I use commas and other punctuation the way I'd use it in Ukrainian or Russian
For these languages, punctuation is almost as important as grammar, especially for a linguist or journalist, etc
Sometimes I wonder if I use too much, but otherwise, the melody of the sentence breaks, and it's difficult to read
Nope, "I'm walking to school now" is the correct one
It usually happens when people try to make their sentences on their language first and then to translate it to English
In Ukraine we "engage in sex"
Food
I guess, we eat it as much as you: in pastry, in the traditional Christmas dish called [кутя/kutia] We also have [poppy seed cakes]
Also, kids just cut the top from a ripe dried poppy seed box and eat the seeds
I did it myself - snatched poppy from my grandma who had it after "Маковія/Makoviya" (a religious holiday on which people bring flowers and poppy to the church)
In the 90s, the awareness of the poppy as the source for opium rose
People in the countryside were complaining that their poppy was being stolen by drug addicts, even the stems without seed boxes were in demand
The amount of cultivated poppy in individual households has greatly diminished since then
E.g., grandma always had a few rows of poppies next to corn, sunflowers, and squashes, but she stopped cultivating it not to tempt the thieves
Also, if I'm not mistaken, the people that cultivated poppy were suspected of the intent of selling it to opium makers
But today wheat fields still have wild red poppies in them, as well as daisies and cornflowers
Besides, all that poppy in pastry has to be cultivated somewhere
They are very often used in bakery
Loved the poppy seed pierozhki as a child, and still love them now to the point that my preferred way to die is to choke on a poppy seed pie
poppy even gave name to piece of cutlery, [макогін]
There's "чернуха/chernukha" (Russian: *blackness*, casual/habitual misery)
> Pessimistic neo-naturalism and muckraking during and after glasnost
> Chernukha is a slang term popularized in the late 1980s, used to describe a tendency toward unrelenting negativity and pessimism both in the arts and in the mass media
Derived from the Russian word for "black" (cherny), chernukha began as a perestroika phenomenon, a rejection of the enforced optimism of official Soviet culture
It arose simultaneously in three particular areas: "serious" fiction (published in "thick" journals such as Novy mir ), film, and investigative reporting
One of the hallmarks of Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost was the open discussion of the misery and violence that was a part of everyday Soviet life, transforming the form and content of the nation's news coverage

If you're talking about Ukraine then it would be basically like winning a lottery ticket
Back to poverty in 10 years
I would copy Swiss anal-retentiveness about social and public property and issues
Our main problem is that the majority of people don't give the most minuscule shit about anything beyond their doorstep
We laugh about the Swiss calling police about neighbor's hedges trimmed not to village code but I would so much like to magically inject a 1/10 of that into the national mentality here
Not from anywhere, because you really don't want ukranian education system
Will be, trust me
English is easy to learn because it's literally everywhere
Nah, not only it's grammar is far easier than the most of European languages, but it's pop culture sphere is the biggest of all languages
Very easy
One of the easiest languages to learn as a foreign language
Well, I started to learn it at 4 years old
It was hard to learn, but now I can speak with you
Btw i am still learning it
Not so hard to start speaking with proper training
But i realy don't like many of rules wich make no sence, for exemple writing and speling of words where one letter can make 3 sounds or not make sound at all
I’m from Ukraine but I’ve spoken Russian all my life
Correct me if I’m wrong but English seems to be extremely different from Russian
The construction of sentences, the pronunciation, alphabet and grammar are kinda far away from each other
Sometimes I can use correct words and formula but it can make zero sense to the English speaking people
However, I find English to be one of the easiest languages to learn (I speak Russian, Ukrainian, German and Norwegian) especially due to it’s popularity and availability of books, guides, free content
It's not a city but a region: Ukrainian Galicia is Галичина (~Halychyna)
Beijing - Пекін (Pekin) comes to mind
Many of the German ones apply too, since we usually use German pronouciation and not English one
Not a city, but
Hungary - Угорщина (Ugorshchyna)
Beijing - Пекін (Pekin);
Vienna - Відень (Viden')
There may be more, but I can't remember
Ukrainian name for Wien is different from both English and Austrian/German names
Відень (smth like "Viden'")
What can you buy for 1, 10 and 100 of your currency in your country
For example, here in Ukraine you can buy a box of matches for 1 hryvnia, a small bag of crisps for 10 hryvnia and half a kilogramme of cheese for 100 hryvnia
That's a lot of garments
Inflation hit you guys hard, I guess
I get the 1 DKK part, you can't really buy much with 1 hryvnia here either
You've got some cheap milk though
You can buy three days worth of food for 10 euro worth of money here, lol
That's some pricy cinnamon powder
You can get 3-5 cinnamon buns or 5-10 cinnamon powder bags(~10-35 grams) here for 10 NOK worth of money
>decent source
Meaning you can buy even more, should it be a fishy middle eastern-looking guy at a kebab stall
100 euro would equate to at least month's worth of food here, if you're a student, it can be your budget for a season
I heard that in France baguettes are cheap but this clears up a lot
They're about the same price here btw
Quite self explanatory
I somehow relate to those seemingly inflated prices
The small bag of crisps I mentioned in the OP used to cost 3 hryvnia back before our economy got fucked up thanks to a certain neighbour
Self explanatory, considering that prostitution is legal in Germany, if I'm not mistaken
I like the concept of a monthly ticket allowing to get a train to anywhere across the country
It just sounds so convenient
Either your prices are even lower than ours or that is a very mediocre ice cream
Is maple syrup as good as they say
I like no-name Chinese candy but if I eat more than 3 in a short time span, I feel like I'm going to throw up
That's some expensive vodka
I'm not really into alcohol but as far as I know, you can buy at least a litre of alright vodka here for 100 SEK worth of money
Inflation hit us hard
I remember buying a kilogramme of the same cheese back in 2008 for 40 hryvnia
And yeah, our matches are strangely cheap, no matter how low our currency gets
I love locally made cheeses and they cost a bit cheaper here but that's if you know where to buy
If you go to some villages in the Carpathians, you can get whole 6 kilos for that much
Some other people replied with higher prices so I pointed that out, that's all
We have our milk even cheaper btw, at around 15-30 hryvnia/litre that amounts to around 0
5-1 euro/litre
Ah, alright
That makes train travel way more expensive
Cursive for Cyrillic languages and printed-like for Latin languages, except German for some reason
Cursive (connected letters) from the first grade
The print is what preschoolers write in
Around middle school, students start to develop their own style of handwriting, and some use print-like elements like the lowercase **T** or a snowflake-like **Ж**.
I use two handwriting styles: regular cursive and a much more compact print-like handwriting
omg, I thought it only was my school, that wanted me to write German in cursive
I actually never learned to write printed
It's slow and why would I do it
All handwriting is cursive
I guess it's pretty standard: the capital for being assholes who hemmorage money, Lviv for being posh (Lviv also gets a whole separate nomination because they fancy themselves the Silicon Valley of Ukraine) and Donbass for being postindustrial degenerates who literally shot themselves in the foot to show them khokhols
And what about Omsk
The city no one can exit
Hell no
No free healthcare
No free education

More left extremists than anywhere else and serious problems with racism and sexism at the same time

Gun violence
>Left wing violence is nothing compared to right wing violence
You are telling this to someone from a country where both communist and nazi regimes killed millions of innocent people
I do not support both right- and left-wing extremists, in case you thought that I support the rightists
>gun violence isn’t really something to complain about when your nation is literally fighting a war in the east against rebels
Even though you don't have a war in your country, more people die from gun violence every year in the US than in the east of Ukraine (10200+(civillians included) for Donbass war since 2014, compare that to US annual gun homicide statistics)
Dragging attention from thousands of gun homicides to an actual war is a dick move
>rebels
Yeah, and Russian citizens including professional military just went hiking near Ukrainian border and got lost
Oh, and some of them were on tanks, but that's just Russia, everything is possible there
I was talking about Ukraine
It was about gun violence, not just homicide rate
Well yes, but not all gun violence acts have dead victims
Hungary - Угорщина (Ugorscheena)

We call other countries very similar to their names, the same, or we use another ending

No one won't be ever able convinced me that it's not a pun to "trash".
And also I know a barbershop that called Balls
That would either be [Eneïda] by Ivan Kotlyarevsky, a remap of the original **Aeneid,** or [Zapovit] by Taras Shevchenko
Strikingly different in their mood, yet both reflect the Ukrainian psyche quite well
Coincidentally, we also have Aeneid also known as *Kotliarevsyi's Eneyida*. It has words like "whore's daughter" and all of that Virgil's literary heritage
> Eneyida is a Ukrainian burlesque poem, written by Ivan Kotlyarevsky in 1798
This mock-heroic poem is considered to be the first literary work published wholly in the modern Ukrainian language
Although Ukrainian was an everyday language to millions of people in Ukraine, it was officially discouraged from literary use in the area controlled by Imperial Russia
> Eneyida is a parody of Virgil's Aeneid, where Kotlyarevsky transformed the Trojan heroes into Zaporozhian Cossacks
Critics believe that it was written in the light of the destruction of Zaporizhian Host by the order of Catherine the Great
The poem was written during the formation of romanticism and nationalism in Europe
At that time, part of the Ukrainian elite was gripped by nostalgia for the Cossack state, which was liquidated by Russia in 1775–1786
> The first three parts of the poem were published in 1798 in St
Petersburg, without the author's knowledge
The complete «Eneyida» was published after Kotlyarevsky's death in 1842
> The poem is in top-100 list by «From Skovoroda to modern time: 100 most important creative art in Ukrainian».
**An excerpt**:
Aeneas was a lively fellow
And quite a Cossack for a lad,
For mischief he was more than mellow
While courage above all he had
But when the Greeks felt very bitter
And made of Troy a heap of litter
He took a bag, and with a lust -
With some good Troyans whom he gathered
Whose hides were tough and necks well lethered -
He showed old Troy a cloud of dust
He quickly built some boats of timber,
Then launched them in the quiet sea
And filling them with muscle limber
He hit the foam where eyes could see
But cackling Juno, dog-gone-daughter,
Kept cackling like a hen for water;
-That's how Aeneas lacked her grace -
A long long time she had been praying:
She wished his soul would stop delaying
The trip to that unearthly place
So many hedgehogs in cities
They live off the trash, I guess
One time I consecutively saw three hedgehogs ~100 m one from another (maybe they were a family)
Not sure if we have anyone else
In a smaller city where people have garden plots, there're wild boars
They come and dig gardens
I used to live in a small military town, and we had roe deer, hares, and boars
We usually were concerned with the boars while going deeper into the nature
Edit: I misread a little
We do have stray cats and dogs in the streets
Usually, cats
Dogs live in more desolated places like industrial areas, but they often can be heard
They also come closer to check what's up
I live in Kyiv (\~3m population) we have many hedgehogs and squirrels + some beavers
The city is surrounded by forests, so sometimes we find forest guests like [moose]
PS: ofc we have many cats, dogs, ducks, etc, but that's not what you're asking about I believe
It basically solidified the reputation of FIFA as one of the most corrupt organisation in the world

Disagree so much(
We say Chekhiya, but I'll call it whatever Czechs themselves prefer if there's an issue
In Ukraine everyone calls it Czechia anyway
We already call it Czechia
* Envy is "*заздрощі/zazdroshchi*" - it's when someone wants what another person has
* Jealousy - "*ревнощі/revnoshchi*" - for when a person is envious of the attention their love interest or parent/friend/etc gives to someone else
It's often romantic but not necessarily
For example, a child can be jealous when their baby sibling gets all the attention
Out of the pair zazdroshchi/zazdrist the singular zazdrist is a lot more common as the equivalent of "envy".
The same plural/singular pair exists for jealousy - revnoshchi/revnist, but the singular revnist is very rarely, if ever, used to mean jealousy, and mostly means diligence
Russian is a complex language
Even if your command of its grammar is near-perfect, you still have doubts about spelling, commas, hyphens, subordinate clauses, etc
That's why they argue, not because they speak different dialects
Russian only has regional words and phrases

"Internet party of Ukraine". It's nominees have names changed to those of star wars characters, and wear costumes of them in public
In 2014 Darth Vader even wanted to run for presidency, but got rejected by Central Election Commission because he denied to take his mask off
This would be the most popular party here

What about "you're welcome"?
Kropyvnytskyi in the middle
Noone knows anyone from there
Fine, really
In terms of city names most became much easier - Dnipropetrovsk to Dnipro (which everyone was using anyway), Dniprodzerzhynsk (which was a goddamn nightmare to pronounce in any language) to Kamyanske
In Kropyvnytskyi there was a popular idea to rename it to "Zlatopil" (similar to Ternopil) which personally would make more sense, but Kropyvnytskyi is probably the most famous person from there, so it's alright
And in terms of name complexity is pretty similar to the old one, so not much changed there
Also there was an idea to return to the original Yelysovetgrad but that's again way to many consonants in a row for Ukrainian language and sounds odd
Also there is a movement to rename Western Ukrainian cities back to pre-soviet names (like Ivano-Frankivsk back to Stanislaw, which makes sense since Franko lived in Lviv his entire life anyway) but the people those cities are named for now are usually much more popular and reveared in Ukraine so I don't think it's going anywhere
It does sound odd, that's true, but at least it makes sense, cause the region is "Red Ruthenia"
it was, but not all cities that were renamed by the Soviets are subject for decommunisation
Basically, if it doesn't have a name of a soviet politician or a clear reference to USSR - it's up to the city itself
And seems like Chervonograd has a position: "it would be nice to return Krystynopil, but it seems like too much hustle"

I think he also lives in  Chrząszczyżewoszyce, powiat Łękołody ^(/s)
They're not really Russian though, they're basically the same Greek names as Alexander or Michael or Nicholas or Alexis
Our versions would be respectively Oleksander, Mychailo, Mycola, and Olexy
I think the difference is negligible but I've found the best way to pick out an American in Kyiv is by their massive Patagonia logo
Don't forget the people that are like, "with me, he's different, we have that special bond" or "they were just asking for it, really".
Russia: Everyone knows current relationships between us and we see them as the real threat
Poland: Not a threat to us at all, we have good relations between us

1943 happend
Cossack period ( 1648–1775 ) - times of uprising, unwilling alliances, betrayals
Also, it's easy to fit other nations like  Tsardom of Russia, Crimean Khanate, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Swedish Empire
UPR times (1918-1921) where you can easily because leaders of it prefer to fight each other rather unite against external enemies that can be fit into assassin/templars shenanigans

The newest term is "*тітушко/titushko*" (plural, "*тітушки/titushky*") - thugs hired by different political forces to either pacify or provoke protesters, or pose as them to create a negative social image (within the country and in foreign media)
From [Wiki]
> **Titushky** are mercenary agents who supported the Ukrainian police force during the administration of Viktor Yanukovych, often posing as street hooligans with the express purpose of performing illegal acts
Titushki raid is a widely used term in Ukrainian mass media and by the general public to describe street beatings, carjackings and kidnappings by unidentified men in civilian clothes from behind the lines of political rallies
>Titushky were employed by the Yanukovych government with having reportedly 200 hryven' to $100 per day in payments
Some of them were also suspected to be illegal formations of combat troops carrying concealed pistols
The one purpose titushky served was the intimidation and dispersal of anti-governmental demonstrations and attacks on participants and representative of the media
> Titushky adopted the strategy of blending into a peaceful crowd or mob and then instigating a violent fight between them which always lead to arrests of peaceful protesters on the grounds of mass disorder; perpetrators were then used either as "witnesses" of the committed "crime" or as "victims". During the events in Ukraine in 2013-2014 known as Euromaidan, they became a collective term for provocateurs and thugs hired by the Party of Regions and law enforcement agents in civilian clothing
Supporters of President Yanukovich also used the term 'tituskhy' to refer to pro-opposition thugs
Basically, they're the newest step in gopniks' evolution
The name "*тітушки/titushky*" (plural) comes from the surname of Vadim Titushko - [a guy] that you'd certainly fall in love with, Reddit
[Just look at him go] He's a former martial artist and a present-day criminal
And [this is] a more general image of *titushky* on duty
Gopniks
Gopniks
They're primitive (usually) provincials lacking self-awareness, or even more literally - "cattle" (рагуль - рогатий); same as *bydlo*. In other words, it's a state of mind, not a subculture or social class
The term can be applied to any nationality as well as city dwellers, as long as they fit the criteria
Ukrainian here, my mother tongue is Russian and I speak Russian daily but can also understand and speak Ukrainian(because we all learn it, duh)
From my interactions with Russians I can tell that they usually can't understand spoken Ukrainian and have trouble reading it
As for myself, knowing two Slavic languages makes things a bit easier
Belarussian is very close to Ukrainian, so I understand it almost perfectly, and what's funny - spoken is much easier than written
Their writing looks a bit weird for our eye
Any other Slavic language spoken is complete gibberish because Eastern languages have distinct phonetics and our ears aren't used to others
Written, Bulgarian looks literally like Russian written with a bunch of mistakes
I even seriously thought so in hotels sometimes
Polish is hard to understand but you can get the gist
Czech is a bit harder
Can't speak about Serbian though
My first languages are Ukrainian and Russian, so I understand Belarusian, Polish and Czech languages pretty well (didn't encounter Slovakian, but I don't think it would be a difficulty to me)
I understand a bit of Bulgarian, but Slovenian and Serbo-Croatian are gibberish to me
It's a very good question
Depends on the school, but lately it's mostly Ukrainian
Documentation is only in Ukrainian
Speaking usually depends on the region
I live in a Russian-speaking city, hearing Ukrainian here is pretty rare unless you're talking to staff in stores etc
You can also start speaking Russian to anyone in the west(Ukrainian  dominated) and they will understand you and respond in Ukrainian
All of us understand both languages but not all of us speak both of them equally well and comfortably, including me
My Ukrainian is subpar and clearly needs polishing, so I usually just speak Russian
Most of Ukrainuan speakers from Western regions don't speak Russian at all, but still understand perfectly
Dude, I almost fell off my chair
That's a really good one
Yes, and they're already kind of independent (if you can call being a puppet of Russia independence), but we are at war with them
There's more like some other country's military than movement
My favourite is probably плачу (plachu) - "I'm paying" and "I'm crying"
Onion and bow (for archery) are both "лук" (look)
But otherwise we have two different words for "dream": сон and мечта
They have different stress, does this still count
I identity myself first as foremost as Ukrainian, then as a western Ukrainian, then as a European and then as a Slav
"Schedule" - I heard at least a few versions of pronouncing and I don`t know which is right, like it's [sheh jool] or [skeh jool]
And also a "Queue"
Crap
Thanks
Ireland
Even if the experience isn't identical, I feel like I can have a chat with an Irishman because they know what a great famine is, how it feels like having the native language suppressed and artists/writers assigned to another country because they spoke/wrote in the more prestigious language of that country, etc
That's Belarus
Although, potato is the language we all speak fluently
Ireland's [azure blue] + [yellow]
On this note, welcome to Ukraine if you dare :) (if you haven't been already)
Russian in Ukraine was strong up until it shot itself in the foot
Now it's the language in which one calls for a pale guy wearing elevated soles to "send in the troops".
There are people that speak Russian and pass it to their children, and believe it's very convenient that we can speak Russian in some former Soviet countries
But there are also people that are bilingual, i.e. have a choice both ways, but they decide to left Russian behind and pass only Ukrainian to their children
I think it makes a big enough dent in Russian's rep of the dominant language in the cultural domain
It's the language of forced poverty and wasted opportunities in a land of oil, gas, diamonds, and timber
P.S.: do the Irish love pathos as much as Ukrainians
> roaming charges
If I understand correctly, you need a mobile data package
In Ukraine, you can buy a local SIM which is relatively cheap and doesn't require any contract
Pick Kyivstar for better coverage
In Ukraine, in big cities, road signs, names of streets, city transport stops, and  announcement in it, are dubbed in English, just for the notice
>Do you mean pathos (if so I don't know what that means) or is that a typo of potatoes
It's actually *potathos*.
(I was jokingly hinting at my own [pathos] in the previous reply)
>Russian would have to become a complete foreign language like it is to Poland
The main objective at the moment is to make everything available in Russian also available in Ukrainian: books, movies, TV-shows, youtube, etc
In some domains like education and service, Ukrainian is being enforced to reverse the process (Russian has been being enforced here for the last 400 years)
Although enforced is a strong word
Let's say, supported by the law so a waitress couldn't deny a visitor service in Ukrainian like it was just up to this February
So maybe it's not reflected by the study but the steps are being made
Hope it works
Also for /u/CrocPB
Every time I ride those suburban or intercity electric trains where you don't have an assigned seat (приміські та міжміські поїзди), I wonder how a foreigner in Ukraine can possibly use them
First, you hear the name of a (!) station mumbled through speakers
It's 99% incomprehensible, just sounds of a victim being choked
Is it *your* station
Who knows
Then, you ask someone, but they don't speak English
You clearly name the stop you need; they start explaining something in a language you don't understand
Then you try to use Google Maps with GPS, but because of the train speed the GPS position is lagging behind and you miss your station or frantically leap and fall through the doors outside because the duration of a minor stop is usually 1-2 min
> I'd heard it before but didn't really know what it meant
We use this word quite often (*пафос*, also *патетика* i.e. emphatic theatrical suffering), so the English adjective *pathetic* meaning sad/pitiful sounds to me a little
counterproductive
>Companies are required to serve people in Ukrainian
Exactly
Everything facing the client, whether it's a service person, a menu, or a website, has to be in Ukrainian by default
Then, if the client wishes to switch to Russian or English, they can ask, and the service person can agree
Also, the majority of business websites usually have a fully-functioning Russian version which used to be the default one
Now the default one has to be in Ukrainian, and then you can switch
When you call, e.g, your internet provider, the initial addressing is in Ukrainian, then they allow you to press 1 for Ukrainian, 2 for Russian, and 3 for English
>People want to watch the highest quality movies and TV shows
Honestly, I'd like Ukrainians to be motivated enough to watch those movies and shows in the original language
As of now, the choice is usually between the Russian dub and the Ukrainian dub, which one comes sooner and has more appeal
So people try to make great Ukrainian dubs
Even Youtube is dubbed, you wouldn't believe how linguistically apathetic some people here are
They also don't travel enough to feel uncomfortable enough to learn a foreign language or two
And as for Russian, it has almost completely replaced Belarusian in Belarus, but not Ukrainian in Ukraine, so there's something we're doing right
There's the major city  with literally the same name in Belarus
Yeah, but now it is called just "Brest"
Chornobyl  and [Sknyliv air show disaster]
Well, like who was so "smart" to think that air show over crowd will be good idea
Can you help me to answer this question
Something about girls, Russia or russian language
"Never heard that country
R u from Russia
Ukraine is Russia, I know what I'm saying
Vodka, hardbass, cyka blyat
In Lviv it was 4 snowy days in Dec and 3 snowy days in Jan (days not in a row), but snow melted fast
It used to
But this winter snow was 2 days
Icelandic is beautiful in a fairytale way
Norwegian is beautiful in a way something you see every day, have gotten used to it and still consider beautiful
Japanese has a beautiful rhythm, so it sounds cool and stylish
I hear some kind of elvish in Icelandic
Don't even want to understand it to not interfere with the charm
[You're welcome] :)
*Everything Is Illuminated*, at least this movie without cliche that all Ukrainians either in mafia or poor as fuck
Do not act as superior
We're pretty kind people originally
Please respect that and don't abuse this feature
Being kind is not the same as being weak or not confident
Almost kicked in the face some drunken Austrian who behaved very rude and superior
Only cctv cams around stopped me from doing that
Regular working class people can't afford to buy new clothes, let alone expensive furniture, with our 250 dollar wages and 70 dollar pensions, so people don't know IKEA
But what we do know is that IKEA got into several scandals over  [illegal deforestations in Ukraine and export of our wood] like we don't have enough of our own problems, Sweden came to help
yes
it is so cool in Germany, Denmark to get fresh steaming loaf of bread early in the morning at local Bäckerei
I miss this in Ukraine, although there are plenty of places with delicious pastry, they usually bake it to be sold in the evening for dinner, people have no habit for fresh pastry in the morning
fish and chips FTW
beef wellington though
eww gross
No "polish groceries" in my city, but there's some polish food in supermarkets
I like Mlekovita Yogurt and Hanusi Twarog
Kabanosy definetly, only most Kabanosy that are sold here are now local (couple of years back there were only Polish)
Germany and Britain
Iceland, especially the Cod Wars
Either Kyiv in the XI-XII century (preferably during a warm season) or a Ukrainian village of the XVII-XIX century
Usually, I imagine it in the fashion of "[Hard to Be a God] i.e., I'm more of an observer than participant or a person that influences historical events
Although, as a teen, I genuinely wanted to partake in an average peasant community's life for a bit
Hard work, simple food, serfdom, songs, the language - the usual ethno-lingvo-culturological stuff
More like repression, dictatorship and instability, really
I can probably recognize a lot of European ones but I don't really know the lyrics
I know bits and pieces of Polish and French text(cause I read reddit hah)
The only one that I know lyrics is Ukrainian cause I learned it at school and know it by heart
Maybe in the future I will read lyrics to other nations anthems
I don't even know a tune of an American one lol that's my knowledge of international anthems
Oh thank you
I especially like rock version, gives it a new vibe:) I remember reading lyrics to Polish one and was surprised when saw mention Napoleon there xD Then read up about it,such a cool story
Edit:grammar
For real
I read it and it's true
How interesting, never knew that and didn't expect that we would in some way mentioned there xD
Southern Ukraine here
We do get tons of lake-effect snow (up to 50-60 cm in certain places) 2-3 times a year when storms from the Mediterranean pass over the Black Sea
It’s usually gone in a day, and everything stops until it melts - I was once stranded in a neighboring city for 2 days as I didn’t listen to the storm warning and decided to drive nevertheless
Paying closer attention now thanks to this valuable lesson
But yes, winters are getting milder for sure
It is in general accepted, but considered teen-ish
I feel like on a woman it would be accepted as women here tend to be on the more decorated side
On men in a workplace - no, because men usually don't decorate themselves even with earrings, and other visible piercing draws even more attention
A guy with studs/tunnels in ears is seen as some alternative type that doesn't spend his time in a usual workspace
A girl with bigger ear tunnels too, tbf
However, all piercing that is not in ears is seen as a thing that people grow out of, so as women grow older, they tend to remove it to be perceived serious
There are many of them because of us being ex-soviet country
Our current president is a former actor and comedian
His campaign started way before the elections when he produced and starred in a TV show called "Servant of the People" where he played an ordinary guy that accidentally was elected to be the president of Ukraine
Anyway, in this show he was so humble and democratic he was using a bike to get to work instead of the usual luxurious cars politicians use
Naturally, after the elections, he ~~started~~ continued to use luxurious cars (he's a rich dude) and also surrounded himself with a security cortege
During a diplomatic visit the president of Estonia [presented him with a bike] We appreciated the trolling
Also, there's a Pakistani (?) animation about a [donkey king] The main character, apparently, turned out to be an unintentional parody of Zelenskyi
Even the dubbing has a few of his catchphrases
Aside from that, there's an alternative dubbing of the trailer to this movie remade into a full-blown parody of Zelenskyi
The Donkey King is one of his newest nicknames
He's a joke himself
Just realizing that he's a president in real life is such tragicomedy that we need no other jokes
Our country leader is an ex stand up comedian, what are we even taking about
“[Get out of here, robber] “
In fact, he's viewed same as Trump in the USA, popular among workers, housewives and so on
"Intelligentsia" hates him, but they're minority, most people like how he's ruling
As an example in December he called all CEOs of big Ukrainian gas companies and said them that tomorrow price for gas should be \~10% reduced because people want to celebrate Christmas without worrying about gas price
(as you understand that's not what he can do, especially in premier-presidential system) But people who're watching TV likes him
PS: in new year's speech his main idea was "doesn't matter what's the name of street, or whose monument is on street important is only that street is with new asphalt and that next to those monument couples are meeting for date". Idea, which is popular among people who don't think that national identity is important
Будапешт. Ш in both Ukrainian and Russian is pronounced as Sh
Here in Ukraine both ways are taught, we say that there are six parts of the world (Europe, Asia, America, Afrika, Antarctica, Australia and Oceania) And six continents (Eurasia, North America, South America, Afrika, Antarctica, Australia and Ocenia)
It has been asked [just a month ago] here
But in my factual answer I'll join my Russian colleagues
Australia and Oceania are 1
Hey, that’s my uncle
I will make a few parts depending on the degree of notoriety

PS: Shevchenko has some connection to the US by his poem [THE HALF-WIT]

" (fragment)
For us, the best-known person from the Wiśniowiecki dynasty is [Dmytro Vyshnevetsky] Jarema is usually viewed as an enemy coz he was against Khmelnytsky, but the role of the main enemy in this war definitely belongs to Mikołaj "Bearpaw" Potocki
Michał  Wiśniowiecki is known only by people who're more or less interested in history because he ruled in a period when Ukraine wasn't part of Rzeczpospolita, and overall the Ruin  (1659 - 1686) period is super complicated so regular people don't know much about it
You're right, that's a thing about our historiography, in many cases for us Ukraine = Kyiv so when Kyiv stopped being part of Rzeczpospolita in our mind Ukraine stopped being part of Rzeczpospolita too
And I guess that the Potocki dynasty is maybe even better known in Ukraine than Wiśniowiecki
PS: the village where my ancestors came from was owned by the Potocki family
PPS: and clearly the most famous noble family in Ukraine is Ostrogski
Now when I think about it, I assume that Dmytro Vyshnevetsky is so well known coz we have an old Cossack [duma] about him (created in 16-17 century) but obviously have nothing about Jarema or Michał.
[In Ukrainian]
[In Belarusian]
PS: BTW we have [duma that mentions Mikołaj Potocki]
We have a shitload of balconies (I have three in my own apartment) but since drunk tourists don't usually stay in residential high-rises, this is not a problem
Our go-to stupid death cause for citizens is usually drowning while swimming drunk in Dnipro
[Dnipro is an enormous river that's treacherously calm and very deep] As we started to have more tourists, some of them managed to partake in that sad activity
I find English more concise than my native languages
Not only I but also other people have noticed that emotional stuff is less gushy in English
Even when I read translated snippets of famous books that are originally in Ukrainian or Russian, I find the English translation more straight to the point, while the original is often very suffix-y and wordy; a lot of information comes from the author's tone
The translation reads like a document with first and foremost information and then all the decorative and emotional stuff that the translator chose to include
Not bad
Not too hard
But in my language you can determine spelling by hearing in most cases, if only English work this way
And order of words to important
I am from Ukraine
It is very easy with nouns forms and verbs forms
But the pronounce is weird imo
If it's not too difficult for you to find the study, I'd like to read it
What I mean is, an English sentence is often packed with information
*In my village, there was a man who had a red fat cat
The red fat cat man was quite weird, but at times the weird of his was even weirder than usual
В моём посёлке/в моей деревне/деревеньке/в нашей глуши жил мужик/мужичок/мужчина/дядька с рыжим котом/у которого был рыжий кот. ~~Мужик с толстым рыжим котом~~ ~~Котовладелец (?)~~ **Тот** мужчина был довольно странный/странноватый/чудаковатый/с придурью...
And so on
I mean, a translator chooses how to translate, but look how every option influences the mood while in the English sentence it's all at once unless something else is added/specified
It sounds not too bad in English, but a neutral word-for-word translation to Russian sounds poor because it's a story, not a criminal report
>Again, it all depends on what mood we choose, a modern story, a fairy tale etc
Yes, it was my point as well
A story is a story and a translator makes a choice on how to deliver it with the means of another language
But it's not as much about the means and the adequacy of translation as to how compact and precise English is comparing to some other languages, and it doesn't look poor as long as you read in English
Thank you for the links and the added explanation
In other words, I've encountered this in action when people would listen to something in a foreign language with phrases in their native language scattered all over it
They admitted that the phrases in their native language almost sounded louder or closer to them physically (it felt so)
They were native English speakers, btw
Although, you might agree that when we start using all those words from English and become annoying people that use a lot of English words and phrases, we don't feel that they're emotionally less charged
E.g, you hit your little toe against something and exclaim
Either aah, or сука, or fuck, or maybe ааа факинг сука, who knows
>I'm not sure what you mean by English sentences being packed with information
It can be my insufficient explanation or maybe we just perceive it differently
To be honest, it's one of those things where I can say *so be it* without any negativity
How I see it
1) Might be the difference between an analytic and synthetic language, but English affixes are mostly used to create derivatives (do - doer, relevant - irrelevant) but not to intensify the meaning (Ru: мужчина - мужчинка - мужик - мужичок - мужлан)
You can use words like fellow, dude, lad, gent, chap, geezer, etc
, but still, it adds to the precision of the description (what kind of man) rather than to your own attitude as the speaker (do I think the man is strong, healthy, average, vile, filthy, etc)
2) Repetition: the boy went, the boy said, the boy sat, the boy replied
It looks completely natural until you try to translate this text and start looking for synonyms to eliminate this repetition because otherwise, the mental image of your school language and literature teacher will frown at you
But what other texts are known for their merciless repetition
Law-related texts, contracts, specifications, and all of them also are known for their precision and informativeness rather than mood
I agree with this:
>English is very well known for its wealth of synonyms expressing certain nuances and collocations
One can use English the way J. Joice and T. Pratchett used it, and yet it often has the tendency towards informativity over form and the author's attitude
Romania is one of our least mentioned neighbors, along with Hungary, Slovakia, and Moldova
People along the West-Southern border must be more in contact with them/you, but, meeting a person from Central Ukraine, you can form their entire opinion about Romania and Romanians, because on average they don't have any
I've heard some associations with Gypsies; maybe it had happened before I started frequenting AskEurope, too, but since I got more aware of the Gypsy stereotype it's been mentioned 2 times by older people (60+)
My dad was passing through Romania on a train in the 80s; he says, the country looked extremely rural, like, pigs walking in the streets rural, but (his words) *I didn't get off the train; Ukraine also has many underdeveloped patches; apparently they're doing much better now, can't tell since I've never been there since they've joined the EU
This language sounds as difficult as Hungarian
better go to Poland or Czechia to find a job instead
As imperialists with weird language that want our land
Kinda civilized gypsies
(FYI It's not my opinion, I just retranslate the stereotype about Romania in our society
Well, I can give an example that I have met recently
Bukovyna is divided between our countries, right
Ours is the northern part of the region
So, you can read the comments here:
Like that one:
Yep, Russians also said they are a brother nation with Ukraine
I'm from Bila Tserkva, which used to be owned by Polish noble family of Branytskyi
They build quite a few things, more notably a catholic cathedral, and orthodox one, winter palace, and most notably Alexandria (which used to be their actuall estate) which is a huge and awesome park today
Well
They kinda are so it's understandable
Actually no
The white church that the city was named after existed during the times of Kievan Rus and was destroyed by the mongols
Since the south of our country is Crimea, nearly 40 million people would find themselves on the small peninsula which is horrendous and fascinating at the same time
Guess the Russians would be surprised
When you're in nature, the norms are slightly different for both genders
Go off the path as far as you're comfortable and make sure to face away from the group of people that you're with
The people in their turn also can look away for a minute, it's all good
Although, the way you phrased it, men urinating *in public* are perceived as deplorable
Nobody wants to see someone fumbling with their genitals or hear the sounds
They're often drunk and dgaf, so it adds to the impression
Quality of roads, mostly
Lol, we do it the same way, and i thought everybody else does this to
> 15-25 min at the time,
Uh, this is NOT a good advice for someone who has never been to a 120C sauna before
/u/simonbleu pay close attention to how you're feeling, I would restrict the uninterrupted period of being in the hot room itself to not more than 4-6 minutes depending on heart health and body fat (less body fat, less time)
>"the clock is ticking"
that probably another common thing in every post-soviet country
I wish we had more cute old wooden balconies like in Georgia
Ukraine also has single pot pension system
Result is that it's critically underfunded and gets additional dotation from national budget each year
The devil in the details, as always
My Carcano from 1917 was built there
Our current president's electorate consisted mostly of this people
Seems like a road where you'd need to back in your car until you and the car coming at you are able to pass each other
I mean, you or the other car - whichever is closer to an intersection/etc
But if there's a grass strip or sidewalk, the cars just push to the sides until they both fit the width of the road
As for the speed limit, I guess, people here aren't used to roads that are 1 car wide strictly, unless it's an apartment block driveway or a quiet village road that is also used for walking and cycling, so drivers instinctively slow down to 20-30 km/h.

There's even a part of a line in the city center
December is pretty depressing, in January it starts to become better and better
Our state in the XVII century appeared because a Polish court denied one nobleman justice
The son of Bohdan Khmelnitsky turned out to be such a total insignificance that he ended up in a monastery, from where he was dragged out by the Turkish invaders
A normal son, by the way, died in Moldavia
We give you our wheat fields
Yall forgeting you need good agriculture to not be dependent on america and usdia for it
*"Яжемать/yazhemat'"* in Russian (means "but-I'm-a-mother") - a woman that validates every stupid action and opinion by her being a mother
Haven't met a *"яжеотец/yazheotets"* (but-I'm-a-father) yet
Derogatory addressing to a snotty kid is a snot, a pee-er (the one who's peeing in their pants), a shitter (the one who's solved Fermat's theorem, obviously)
Let's use the new word in a sentence:
* "but-I'm-a-mother, I know what's better for my child"
* "but-I'm-a-mother, I don't feel like letting my son/daughter wasting their life away with that partner they've chosen"
* "but-I'm-a-mother, I can't just sit and wait here"
* "but-I'm-a-mother, so I'm a more complete woman than those other non-mothers"
This is a broader term that includes but isn't limited by entitlement or helicopter-parenting
Maybe it's being used in more civil situations like "but-I'm-a-father, I feel for these kids" or "but-I'm-a-father, my opinion should be respected".
It's probably not universally known here, but when you learn to skydive and you need to count several seconds, you are taught to do this like 501, 502, 503
For me (Ukrainian ) it's chocolate and other sweets
I didn't know that our sweets are so delicious till I started travelling around the EU Everything's amazing there, except sweets
Even Toblerone dosen't taste so good
It's probably too late to write but salo with chocolate, I don't think anyone has it but Ukraine
Hahaaha
I know sounds gross or weird but it's good though
So if you're gonna travel to Lviv, you have to try it :)
Here [some] [photos]
Our autonomous region, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, is temporarily occupied by Russian Federation
By the law it has politically, has its own legislative ( Supreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea) and executive ( Council of Ministers of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea  ) branches of government
Can't say it's fully economically autonomous, but the budget of AR Crimea is present in the budget system of Ukraine as a separate branch
There were some talks in our politics that Crimea also should be cultural autonomy of Crimean Tatars after the de-occupation, but I doubt that will become possible even when the peninsula will be free
Main problem - it is not like there is a union about this question between politics
Kyiv city also has somewhat special legal status, e.g. it doesn't report to a governor
It wouldn't affect, but maybe we would be able to ask someone about was it really French spies who [burned half of Kyiv in 1811]
No, we only have dumplings with meat (it's a traditional dish), and I've never seen fruit-filled dumplings in any vegetarian cafes here either
But I'll make sure to try them next time I travel to Austria, they sound good
Edit: As some people said here, pelmeni (dumplings) ≠ vareniki
To find out their differences and more, read replies to this comment below
That could be a confusing topic though, as this is specific to our culture, so no worries:)
From a Ukrainian perspective, ***pelmeni*** and ***varenyky*** both belong to the family of dishes, which take small portions of dough and fill them with something, then boil in water with salt (+optional spices)
However, they're quite different
**Pelmeni** is a sturdy, calorific food
The dough is traditionally made with flour, water, egg and some plant oil
The filling is meat with onions, salt and pepper
The dish was apparently adopted to Siberia from Mongolia/China
So imagine working families that make tons of *pelmeni* to maintain their calorific intake in a relatively cold climate
**Varenyky** are both food and dessert
The dough is traditionally made with flour, milk whey/sour milk, egg, salt, baking soda (to make the dough grow)
The filling is whatever people want
* If it's the main calorific dish, the filling is usually meat, roasted bacon, egg, potato, stewed cabbage (separately or somehow combined)
These are usually served with plant oil+roasted onions (+roasted bacon again, optionally)
* Varenyky with the cottage cheese are in the category of their own
They can be salty or sweet and are usually served with sour cream
* Last but not least, sweet varenyky filled with seasonal fruits: cherry, red/black currant, plums/apricots, etc
These are served with sour cream or honey
Varenyky with cherries are the most prominent in Ukrainian cuisine, along with varenyky with cottage cheese and varenyky with fried bacon
I'll go to one of the 24 hour supermarkets
I won't even be the most drunk
Another option - return to the bar and order some food
Almost all the bars here have a choice of dishes
Or 24h McDonalds for cheap, filling and not messy food
People in my city ride either MTBs or road racers
I have both, but I use the road racer more
I'm not european
For me, raw meat is a no-no (that includes any meat - mammals, birds, fish
I just cannot wrap my head around uncooked meat
But what's wrong with talking with your dog
How else are you gonna communicate with it
I eat hot-smoked
They said as if it was strange and unusual, for me it seems like the most natural thing to do
Yeah, first tried, then realized sushi is where they put raw fish
Don't try it anymore:) It's not that I was sick, just my mind reads it as non-edible
> What are they like
Quite
> How are the radiation levels
There are hotspots in Prypiat, but if you with a guide you will avoid it and route are pretty safe
Wouldn't recommend going to the Zone illegal, first - you can be arrested, second - radiation poisiong even in small scales isn't a joke
> Are there wildlife and trees growing
Yes, wildlife is flourishing without humans there - wolves, Przewalski’s horses, brown bears European bisons e.t.c.
In Prypiat trees are everywhere
>I remember hearing something about another accident recently
Wildfires, a good piece of Red Forrest are burned to the ground and fire was close to Prypiat . And as some sources claims fires were very close to the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel
Wildfires happen time to time, but this was one of the biggest
Probably some idiots from a nearby areas (from Zhytomyr Oblast for example) wanted to burn their fields before planting season and lost control of fire
That becomes a common problem
I haven't been there myself but wanted to add a few spots on google street view:
* [within Prypyat'] - poplar, acacia, and pine trees everywhere - exactly as it should be in northern Ukraine
* [the nature nearby]
Oooff, from 1991
• Many early historic states which existed on our land, but I can't call it "country" for example [Antes State] 4th-7th century
• 882-1240 (Rus)
• 1253–1349 (Kingdom of Ruthenia)
• 1648 - 1653 (Khmelnytsky Uprising against Rzeczpospolita)
• 1708 - 1709 (Mazepa Uprising against Russian Empire)
• 1918 - 1921 (UPR, Ukrainian State, Directorate of Ukraine, WUPR)
• 1991 -
PS: technically we can count also time when we were part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Вели́ке кня́зівство Лито́вське, Руське, Жемайтське та інших земель) and later part of Polish Lithuanian Union (Rzeczpospolita)
Because Ukrainian lands become part of this country not as result of conquest etc but because of Dynastic union, and we still had right of voting and so on
Don't forget about 1917-1921
The Byzantine Empire seems very much an independent Greek state though, there was not much Roman left in it by 500 AD or so
It's not a successor to Athens League but the modern Greece is very much a successor of the Byzantine Empire
mhmhmmm
Maybe, so, my mistake
Milan
Literally nothing to see except hundreds of stores and thousands of people going there
Also the Duomo is so-so
I dunno, I kinda like Athens, it's just so enormous and chaotic and cozy at the same time
If you like cities that may be ugly but that are truly alive then you'll be in heaven
Ukrainian Cyrillic transliterates H as **Г**. But don't confuse it with **Г** in other languages that also use Cyrillic
For example, the Russian  **Г** is **Ґ** in Ukrainian (notice the diacritic)
The hard **Ґ** transliterates to G (in English: *gossip, gallery*)
The soft **Г** is breathy and transliterates to H (in English: *happy, house*)
You can listen [here]
Yes in Russian, no in Ukrainian
Cyrillic isn't too different from Latin
Each language that uses Cyrillic has its own phonemes represented by the script
Sometimes the script is modified or enhanced with more characters/diacritics to represent the phonemes better
It shows how each language has its own history where certain characters have changed or fallen out of usage
Not really
Wow, that's fucked up
I've already told about it on Reddit, the name Michael is inseparable with the animal bear in Russian since the diminutive for a bear is "*misha*" and the nickname for "Mikhail" (Michael) is also "Misha".
All fairytale-ish bears are *Mikhail*s, sometimes even *Mikhail Potapovich* (Mikhail, son of Potap), which is a play on words meaning "Bear son of Stomper" or just "stomping bear".
Also, Russian has many loanwords from Ukrainian which don't make sense next to other Russian words of different origins
For example, the Ukrainian word for Sunday is "*неділя/nedilia*" i.e., literally "*the day you do nothing*". In Russian, "*неделя/nedelia*" means "week/7 days", and Sunday in Russian is "resurrection". Every Sunday is the resurrection day
Another Ukrainian word is "*коло/kolo*" (circle) which is the root for Russian words like "*колесо/kolieso*" (wheel), "*кольцо/koltso*" (ring), "*околица/okolitsa*" (outskirts)
But the Russian word for "circle" itself is "*круг/krug*".
Maybe that one "krug" word is a loanword from Church Slavonic
Historically, Russian has been in contact with Polish, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Church Slavonic (the language of the Bible which linguistically is a South Slavic language)
>circle is ,,kruh"
Is it by chance a geometry term
In Ukrainian, "окружність/o**kruzh**nist" (circumference) is the length of a "*коло/kolo*" (circle) when it's a drawn figure
We also have words like "*кружляти/kruzhliaty*" (to spin, go in circles) and "*кружка/kruzhka*" (a mug)
>proto-Slavic or Old Church Slavonic
But these don't just mean "very old Slavic". The first one is a concept, same as the Proto-Indo-European language
We can speak about shared etymology/roots in both proto-Slavic and Proto-Indo-European, and these are cognates, even if the meanings are opposite
Old Church Slavonic is a dead literature *language* which belongs to the established subgroup of South Slavic languages and has written examples, same as Latin
It's the first language the Bible was translated to; it was brought to Rus along with Christianity, and Rus alredy had an established spoken language at the time
So when we speak about Old Church Slavonic roots, they're borrowings which have become synonymus with the already existed words
In disctionaries, "kolo" is synonymous with "krug", but etymologically there's a slight difference
"Kolo" is something like a wheel or millstone, and "krug" is a ring, something bent to form a circle
From Ukrainian perpective, it makes sense since "krug" is the length of a drawn circle in geometry, as well as circled/concentrated movement, but many other "rounds words" consistently have the "kolo" root, as well as the word "circle" itself
In Russian, "round words" are less consistent, and the word "kolo" is absent
Along with other examples of inconsistent usage like "nedilia", I assume these are borrowings from either Ukrainian (its local linguistic ancestor) or the Bible language which was used as the language of literature
We have at least 3-4 hours of history each week for 6-7 years in middle and high school
I've read here on Reddit that you learn one subject for half a year and then it might never be resumed
If it's true, we just spend more time on it
Imagine learning the history of the country but theres no country
Just the people
I see, thank you for clearing it out for me
>  It was actually comparable with the number of hours of history I had during my 4 years of high school in Poland
An American redditor explained this concept to me once
But it still feels like we need more hours to learn the whole Ukrainian History from the earliest people/civilizations to the 2000s and World History that includes the earliest civilisations (Sumer, Egypt, China, Greece), Asia, the Americas, each European country individually and during some significant events
If you don't mind answering, do you also have two different subjects or is it one holistic World History curriculum
I was 15 when ended school and 16 when joined university because I had a birthday after I signed documents with my uni
Commonly, it's 16-18 years when finishing school and joins the university, some may join later because we have mandatory military service .
When I studied we had 11 year school and we finished in most at the 17 years but Ukraine introduce 12 year school so students finish it at the 18
Kyiv is named after its legendary founder Kyi
Together with his brothers Schek and Khoryv and sister Lybid' he founded a settlement here
*Водяник* (vodianyk) in Ukrainian mythology
Alien invasion
We know that aliens mostly like to attack only US and pretend like there are no other countries in the world
Car chase - our roads are made to prevent speed chases or that will be shortest car chase scene ever
High speed police chases
Ukrainian police has Toyota Prius as its main car
Or movies about good cops;)
And if you're under 14 you have to go to the next nearest
Yes, that why i say -  mostly
Yeah, they are being gifted by Japanese government
It has something to do with the Kyoto protocol
Also, they gifted Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV
Also, Ukrainian police uses Skoda Octavia and Skoda Rapid
Bonus points for going in full school uniform
That shows you are responsible  citizen, so won't drink to death
Did you ally with emus
It is possible but it probably won't amount to much
People with really thick Ukrainian dialects generally don't know the standard version of our language or at the least struggle to speak it, while they have no problems with writing it
So if you go somewhere high in the Carpathians, you'd have to make due with the least intelligible version of Ukrainian language possible (it sounds interesting though)
But while the more rural folks have their thick dialects, generally in oblasts' centres, people speak either the standard dialect, surzhyk and sometimes Russian
We have some differences between how we say things in the East and the West but generally you can't distinguish them unless you're a native speaker
As for people speaking surzhyk, it's best to avoid them, they're not really the best at oratory and you probably won't get much out of discussing something with them
>As for people speaking surzhyk, it's best to avoid them, they're not really the best at oratory and you probably won't get much out of discussing something with them
Quite a sweeping statement
I'm fine with different currency as long as everywhere my domestic card is accepted
"*Вареники/varenyky*" that can have any filling and several types of dough
The dough is usually soft and airy, but if you make *varenyky* with meat or other non-sweet fillings, you can make the dough flat and simple, like for *pelmeni*.
In the traditional Ukrainian cuisine, there are *varenyky*:
* with [potato and onions]
* with cabbage and/or mushrooms;
* with [sour cherry] and other fruits like plums or redcurrant (are served with sour cream or honey);
* with [quark] (sweet or salted) and sour cream;
* with [liver]
* with [roasted becon]
Vareniki, come with everything possible inside, but my favorite are with cherry
Lol, I didn't know that the word 'quark' also means cottage cheese
My only association with this word was physics
It reminds me of [this] I've never worked with this software, just remember the name
Смачного! (i.e., enjoy your meal)
I love every filling, but sweetened quark/cottage cheese is on top, along with potato+onions
Oh, here we go again
In Europe it's Italy, because I love their food, history, landscapes
From the rest of the world it's Japan, but i don't know why, I don't like anime or Japanese food, but I'm in big love with Japan
Tricky question for a Ukrainian
Viktor Yanukovich, I guess
I mean, he stole tens of billions of dollars from Ukraine, that's not just crime, that's an outstanding level of theft
Yanukovich
Timing is key
He stole money as he was fleeing to Russia in 2014, during protests that wanted him out
Sort of like a cover up
all Italian ordinary people I've met were very kind and cool, though
but Salvini, I hate him more than pineapple pizza
In my childhood we had this variation with a well instead of a rock
Now it seems to be completely gone
> 325€
This amount looks like average Ukrainian wage
At least, the official ones
It's very broad question and answer is different for different people
My region and social circle is very anti-communist for example, but every single person I talked to that was officer in USSR said that they miss it greatly
Imagine that you're a young engineer in the Soviet Union, just graduate after university and have your first job
You feel that your knowledge can help your Motherland to become a greatest communist country in the world
Then  you anderstand that all you have to do is just sit on your chair from 9 am to 6 am and do nothing just pretend that you do something
Money you'll get anyway
The only time when you work hard is when they send you and your comrades to a kolkhoz to help village people to harvest potatoes
Because all youth from villages fleed to cities for the best
So actually not that bad but this system can't last too long and in 1991 collapsed
And guys who worked from 9 to 6 suddenly understood that their knowledge of how to do nothing is irrelevant in real world
So they began to worship the ol' good days
I was like, a channel called *ushanka* show
Must be some Soviet nostalgia/interest milking channel
So I clicked the link and found [this particular video] on relationships between Ukrainians and Russians in the 1980s, but it has a lot of additional information to set the background for anyone inquiring about the life prior to the dissolution

That's hilarious
EU, black color on the flag, Flanders that refused their own language for Dutch, Waloons that refused their own language for French, chocolate, dark chocolate
EU,chocolate,Hercule Poirot,always without government
What's about Walloon and Flemish
I know, as it would be weird for Belgium to kinda "survive" as functioning state without something like this
It's just Belgium users love to talk about that and first time I heard it, it struck me so much that I remember it to this day, so I decided to include this
> These are regions where they speak these languages
Sorry, what
Ok, you decided not to create your own literary standard
What's about Walloon
It has its own literary standard
Also:
>Legally, Walloon has been recognized since 1990 by the French Community of Belgium, the cultural authority of Wallonia, as an "indigenous regional language" which must be studied in schools and encouraged

I asked the landlord in April to install the AC for the summer, since I was sure that due to Covid I would have to work from home
This summer, the AC was the real MVP
It was definitely worth to ask for AC
Titushky - young people (athletes, gopninks e.t.c) that blending into a peaceful crowd or mob and then instigating a violent  fight between them which always lead to arrests of peaceful protesters  on the grounds of mass disorder; perpetrators were then used either as  "witnesses" of the committed "crime" or as "victims".

How late is night
Before midnight you'd be safe in streets especially busy ones
3-4 am I would avoid many regions
The downtown is safe enough
A lot of sketchy areas you can be robbed, some areas where addicts choose to hang out
Wouldn't recommend it in general
The center and tourist spots may be relatively safe, but everything further from it, especially, sleeping blocks aren't 100% safe, and find troubles for your fifth spot may be very easy

One of the travel bloggers from Ukraine forgot his camera on your loop road somewhere in the wild and returned after he drove a couple of hours
Thr camera was not there
The police literally found him later calling to his hostel and returned the camera - someone picked it up and brought to the police
Not sure if people understand that fifth spot is ass
I am from Kharkiv
Surely you can be pickpocketed in a crowded bus, that's no brainer

It's normal in Ukraine and, as far as I know, in other Slavic countries too
For a Ukrainian, it's not obvious, actually
I assume you hint on her since Spaniards are touchy-feely, but Ukrainians aren't northerners in this regard, too, especially women
On the other hand, I start to wonder how much is your *too much* then
I've no idea about this "lover hierarchy", besides, Slavic people are different within themselves
Ukrainians tend to be affectionate with family and friends, more so in relationships
On the second though, our women love to tease in a relationship accentuating how the man is crazy about them and all, so I imagine a Ukrainian wife dropping something like "c'mon, stop kissing me for just a bit, I'm not an ice cream".
Sounds weird
That Europe = Western Europe
Waiting for Hungarians to remind us that there's a thing called Central Europe
I totally can understand those who don't want to be associated with "East Europe" but forcing the idea of "Central Europe" looks too artificial to me
This division East-West is rather historical than geographical
What happens in Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch stays in Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
But now it's rather a way to distantiate yourself from "filthy easterners"
I understand why you like to think this way
But most of the people don't go that deep and use just East-West
UPD
By the way, unlike Central Europe, V-4 is a term which is used in real life and has its point
Pretty popular term in news and analitics
At least in Europe
In Kyiv, you can get a 250m2 luxury flat in the city center, 13 normal size (40-50m2) flats outside of the city center, 400-700m2 house with a garden (overall 2000m2 land)
You can buy around 10 flats in middle sized cities and rent them out 150-200 dollars each, and not worry about money anymore
Holly shit, where is it
It's basically a village
At least for me, the room is anything that is not toilet/bath/kitchen/balcony/corridor
You can use a room for home office, playing room for children, living room, etc, that's why I don't call it a bedroom
LMAO we are just multulingual
Edit: yeah, most people here including me know more than two languages, sorry
In Ukraine the first floor is the one at street level

Elon please stop lol
all the damn soviet names we got rid of (expect in crimea)
there are a lot of small towns and villages across Ukraine, Belarus and Russia called [Городок] which translates as "small town" and even more [Городище] "town"
oldest bridge in Paris is called ["New bridge"]
[Old New Year] is also a thing
Bosnian [Bosanska Artiljerija] and Estonian [Metsavendade laul] are my favorites
I also absolutely love American Civil War songs like " I wish I was in Dixie" or "Battle hymn of the republic"
The Cadets Of Guard School is a great song from the Russian empire (vyatka super for any TNO players)
it is not played on the radio in my country, therefore I heard this song this year
it is, indeed, brilliant
Chicken Kiev
It used to be a popular restaurant dish in Soviet times, but no one cooked it at home
You can find it in the frozen section in the supermarket, but it's just one brand that makes it I don't think very many people my age (late thirties) or younger ever buy it
And when going out, Ukrainians clearly prefer Asian, Italian or Georgian cuisine over Ukrainian
We eat a fair amount of sauerkraut in Ukraine, but it's always white cabbage (often with some carrot) and we don't ever cook it
I do love German cooked red sauerkraut and buy a can of the ready made one in the supermarket as soon as I get there )))
I guess cafeterias here would have it as well
Well, I don't think anyone doesn't know anything
Where we're going, we don't need infrastructure
If there is any way that a public work can be botched, half-assed, or cost-slashed by giving it to inadequate, uncaring, or usually straight corrupt contractors, it will be done in the most atrocious way possible
By any West European standard, 90% of our sidewalks (mostly considered perfectly walkable by locals) are basically a pile of asphalt thrown into the mud and leveled a bit
Worse than that, common attitude to any problem related to public property is apathetic
Nobody on the street will support you if you yell at an asshole who parked on a sidewalk, etc
There's a lot of people who told me they would like to move here for perceived low CoL but I think they underestimate the amount of shit they take for granted in their lives and how the absense of it will get on their nerves here

WTF
Ukraine's climate is continental, i.e. +25-33C in summer and 0C and below in winter
Right now it's -8C. We rarely experience -20C, but it happens at least once every winter (except for the last winter)
So when we have those really cold days, it depends on humidity
-20C + dry air = refreshing
The cold winter sun is out
Freezing cold water feels warm
Your phone doesn't react to the touch each time, but it's not like it reacts each time when it's warmer
-7C and high humidity = unpleasant; the cold is crawling under your clothes
It's usually windier, too
That's the secret behind living in much colder climates - low humidity
In general, everything works as usual when it's really cold
Obviously, some cars parked outside don't start at first; you need to warm the car first
But when it comes to public transport, heavy snowfalls is what creates extra traffic, not the cold
When I went to school, we had days off when the temperature dropped to -20C. I'm not sure what's going on now, especially during the pandemic
I guess each school decides if they have the means to heat the building
When it's cold, it's especially nice to get into a store or a cafe and buy some coffee or tea
It helps to stay warm
We have those [hot beverage kiosks] in public places
Some of them are mobile
There are also coffee/tea vending machines everywhere
People can buy a hot drink everywhere, at a bus stop, in a park, in supermarkets, in stores that sell electronics and other non-edible stuff
As for your question about phones and gloves, I've come to appreciate half-mittens, when only the tips of my fingers are not covered with the mittens
When I don't handle the phone, I put my hands into the pockets, and that's it

Drywall is only used in office buildings here
I can't imagine someone using it in a house
We either rent a van (usually comes with a driver) or just load the item inside (or onto the roof railings) our car, if it's a station wagon or an SUV with enough space
We order the items with delivery
Pick-up trucks are almost non-existent
Most of the places that sell such things, offer delivery and movers
If not, there are a lot of options to hire
Delivery
It's either a moving service where you're able to pick the size/model of the vehicle and rent it hourly or a postal/delivery service that works as an intermediate between the seller and the buyer
Moving services are usually available in bigger places
You call them, specify the size of your load, book a vehicle, specify if you need people to help move the object, and that's it
Essentially, you use them as a borrowed truck
When you order something from a business, whatever the size of the object is, it's always possible that they'll deliver it themselves
Sometimes even for free to attract customers
Or they arrange the delivery via one of the usual postal/delivery services that work across the country
Those services can deliver whatever you need - wardrobes, couches, cinder blocks, wooden logs, but the bigger is the object, the higher is the price
The more remote/obscure your location is, the fewer opportunities you have, so people from villages usually have three options: fit the thing in/on your own car, ask a relative/neighbour with a minibus, or order through the aforementioned postal service
Well, Americans still call big cars "trucks" for some reason
Same goes for us
Yes, we did a little bit of cooking I'd say
Nothing too complicated but not that easy
I remember, we did some salads and thin pancakes,maybe some kind of other desserts too
A very small % of the names often used in the Slavic speaking countries are local (i.e., derived from words in the Slavic languages)
The majority are of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew (Biblical) origin
Actual Slavic names are:
* Liudmyla (liked by people);
* Sviatoslav (the one who glorifies holiness);
* Volodymyr (the one who owns/rules the world)
Stems like *-slav* *-slava* (glory) and -myr (world) are parts of many compound Slavic names
There're also other names that were calqued from yet again Greek or Latin, for example:
* Svetlana (literally "she-light"; a translation of the Greek name Fotina);
* Bogdan (literally "the one given by God", which is a translation of the name Theodor, which, yet again, has local cognates Fedir (Ukrainian) and Fiodor (Russian)
Excuse this wordy reply, it's not 100% directed at you
It's just that many people pick a name that they associate with Slavic countries, call it "a Russian name", and this name is often of Greek/etc origin; some Byzantine emperor or a Biblical martyr had that name
Great to know it was interesting to you
Yes, since Olha and Oleh were names of Kyivan rulers of Varangian (northern incomers from the Baltic area) descent, those names feel very local, so it took me a minute to realize they're not, too
It's like realizing why someone named Marshall Mathers would call himself Eminem
BTW, Olha's son was named Sviatoslav, and her grandson was Volodymyr the Great who adopted Christianity
We gave up 3rd largest nuclear arsenal, basically for nothing
Yes, USA, UK and Russia have guarantees to preserve Ukrainian sovereignty and territory
But , without mechanism of realization of "guarantees " as 2014 year showed
I don't really think most people know enough about us to have any real stereotypes
That's a good one
I distinctly remember seeing a lot of them ten years ago, but haven't seen a single one lately
Don't you have stereotype about rich dudes
cheap accommodation, tasty food, gorgeous women, shitty roads, grumpy people on the streets (very friendly if you talk to them, though)
While it is one of the poorest area in Europe, it's not *that* bad
We still very well of compared to the rest of world, and we are trying to improve
Hey
What about Moldova
large cities are indistinguishable from average European city (except abundance of ads I think)
the countryside, though, is ХІХ century without food scarcity
I don't like it

Not everyday of course, but it's standard thing to see at holiday tables and as закуска during parties
Petrol may be cheap compared to EU prices, but for locals it's pretty damn expensive
It costs something like 1€/l, while average salary in Ukraine is a bit more than 300€ per month
There are many relatively new cards now, but a lot of Soviet ones too
That's was our stereotype about Russians in 90s
Track suits yes, everything else - ahem, what
That's out stereotype of georgians/azerbaijanis/armenians

Many people on the West don't realize that Soviet Union is equal to Nazi Germany in its anti-human acts
You probably comparing discrimination policies with genocide
While discrimination is far from good, **killing** millions of civil people just for them being Jews/Ukrainians is far, far worse
\> Had it been under nazi rule for another 10 years it would be empty space populated by ethnic Germans
They haven't finished with Ukrainians and other closer nationals to move to recently gained Poland
Moreover, it wasn't about "saving" Europe but conquering Europe, which we can even observe from Eastern Bloc
What's your measurement of evil
If Nazi genocided millions of people and Sovok genocided millions of people, they are equally bad
No matter what's the quantity of those millions
I heat my house in village with wood when it's cold outside, my neighbours do same , so probably this is typical situation for ukrainian village or even small towns

It is a superiority of some English speaking people assuming everyone should know and speak English
Same for Russian, I feel your pain
But actually real retards in stories like these are those people
Because usually they know only one language (English/Russian)
Who cares
Just imagine that people call you nazi for you using Polish in some Polish city, that was

Yeah, it's funny, it's kind of a popular sentiment here, but no one really noticed around us, lol
In post soviet state . porns sometimes are referred as  "German movies"
what does it mean exactly
Is it about invading Poland or is it about running away to Poland, how we use the phrase "I have time to make it to the Finnish border" in the sense "i'm doing something weird or dangerous but its gonna be ok/i still have time to get away"?
Same here

Doritos and decent roads
Everyone has a patronymic, i.e., the name of their father after their first name
Grammatically patronymics are similar to the handmades' nicknames from the TV show - of-Ivan, of-Viktor, of-Serhiy, etc
So daughters of some man named Oleksandr are Daryna Oleksandrivna (of-Oleksandr, feminine form), Olena Oleksandrivna, etc
And his sons are Dmytro Oleksandrovych (of-Oleksandr, male form), Yevhen Oleksandrovych, etc
Then there's also a family name, Ivan Oleksandrovych **Moroz**.
Some patronymics have become family names, so there're surnames like Oleksandrovych, Oleksandriv, etc
Patronymics are widely used to address older people, people in power, or just people in a formal setting
So, your friend's parent may be auntie Tania to you, but their grandparent is usually addressed using their Name+Patronymic
Also, teachers are addressed by their Name+Patronymic without exception
Elderly people often call each other using patronymics only, e.g., *good morning, Oleksandrivna* (literally, a daughter of Oleksandr, of-Oleksandr), *did you see the concert on TV last night
It's their thing; maybe because when older people meet later in life, they start with addressing each other by Name+Patronymic and then just shorten it for convenience without going too informal and juvenile
We have patronimical names
In Ukrainian, similar to Western Slavic languages, we have a formal addressing "pan/pani" (male/female)
Unlike, e.g., Polish, we don't use it casually, but it is possible to address someone as *"pani Olga"* instead of *"Olga Fedorivna"*.
*"Pan Yakovenko"* (*Yakovenko* being a common surname) is also a valid addressing, but more when people in a proper setting talk about someone who's absent
For example, someone is being interviewed on TV, and they mention some other person as *"Pan Yakovenko has said
"*.
I guess, since "pan/pani" literally means *"lord/madam"* or *"someone who owns land and rules over smaller people"* (not an official title though, just an addressing), it was perceived as bourgeois in the Soviet times, and the Name+Patronymic addressing (or just *"tovarisch* (literally, *comrade*) *Petrov/Petrova"*) became the most prevalent and usual in our documents, workspace, education, etc
*Tovarisches* vanished simultaneously with the USSR, though
In Ukraine, the tradition for *"pan/pani"* is more common in the west which is closer to Central European Slavic-speaking countries
In Russian, it is possible to address someone as *"gospodin/gospozha"* (petty much the same meaning - *"lord/madam"*), but it's only used in two settings: in their parliament and in BDSM
> What if you don’t know the persons patronymic name
When you don't know but think it would be really inappropriate or awkward to not use it, you just say: *excuse me, may I know your patronymic/full name
* And after that, they just say their Name+Patronymic or wave their hand saying it's fine to just use their name
> She would never be addressed using the last name
It sounds like someone is putting themselves in a position superior to her, and not in a respectful way
I personally like [this evil building] (IQ Business Center, Kyiv)
Looming [like a creep]
Peeking from behind the corner [like a psycho]
View [from the top]
Appears cozy and spaceship-like [in fog]
Looks cool [at night]
Thank you, come to the dark side
Since you have the Ukrainian flair among others, I only assume you've seen [this] It's called "Mavka
The Forest Song". They've been cooking it for nearly 4 years now, with no palpable results aside for their [PR campaign] I'm still not sure about this project, we'll see
The first trailer came up right after Frozen, and Mavka had the same "frog eyes small mouth" design as Anna, Elsa, and Rapunzel, so there was come comparison to Disney
AFAIK, Mavka was redesigned to [this] and [this]
Another option for a Ukrainian princess is Anna of Kyiv, Yaroslav the Wise's daughter
Or Roxolana (aka Hurrem Sultan)
But both stories are not for children
Great Patriotic War is a bit of a mistranslation
The closest word-to-word would be Great Fatherland War or somrthing like that
And it's only the eastern front 1941-1945
That and WW2 are separate concepts
It is definitely usually translated as Great Patriotic War
That's what English Wikipedia says
I just wanted to clarify that it's not an accurate translation, although the most common one
It's a direct translation of the Russian name and they're really close languages
My native language is actually Russian
We have almost full year on 20th century and WW2 is a big part of it
It's also covered a bit before that
Narrative depends on the teacher and it's moved a bit lately for obvious reasons
Decommunisation and all
Eastern front is the main topic of course, down to operations, big battles and all of that
What do you mean by the opposite side
That's true that since 1990-ies the cockroaches almost extinct
Local urban legends used to say that it's because of cellphones and microwave ovens, which is silly because those bastards are extremely radiation-proof
&#x200B;
In reality, they started to extinct when modern repellents became available
In Soviet times the most commons anti-cockroach thing was DIY mix of egg yolk and boric acid
But in the end, insects adapted and either ignored or just ate them
But modern poisons, which destroy their reproduction cycle or taint one insect and kill the whole nest had really change the game
I lived in a dorm with cockroaches
I had a microwave in my room and, occasionally, when I would heat up some food there, a cockroach would somehow crawl into the microwave, while it's working, and explode
> Insects in general are fairly resistant to radiation, but cockroaches are not
The more you live the more you learn
> This is not to say that the existance of microwave ovens and cell phones has anything to do with cockroach population
Anyway, in my hometown they started to extinct long before cellphones and microwaves became common
I dunno, started learning Polish on Duolingo
Is it a new stereotype for Ukrainians - to move to Poland
*Ф Шчебжешинє хшонж бжмі ф тшчінє*, am I doing any good
Ate borszcz with salo, love it
Indeed, indeed - such is life
Yes, after you finish the tree you need some practice with native speakers, and while you're at it, you get a job and a place to live
Хшон**шч**? Хшон**щ**?
According to [this table] szcz=щ, so technically хшон**щ** is correct
But in practice, Ukrainians love to palatalize and pronounce щ either like "shch" or "sch", or even like "sh".
Purely phonetically, I'd rather spell it like хшон**шч** and **Шч**ебжешин.
Not strong, still someone seems this as ok
Personally, I don't. It backfired greatly not so long ago, so I am not sure why we should allow it
We have no and pretty much nobody supports it
With our country, we don't have that much people that may need a second nationality, because, apart from Russians and Polish guys, we're pretty pure nationality-wise
On the other hand, it opens up possibilities and leeways for collosal corruption and schemes and should we allow it, we're going to have our oligarchs suck money out of our state into their pockets, like vampires they are
So yeah, the cons heavily outweigh the benefits for us
So you can get a citizenship just by having relatives born in pre-Trianon Hungary
I am from Transcarpathian region and kinda want hungarian citizenship, I know for a fact that my great grandfather was born in Hungarian Kingdom but he was not hungarian, do I have any chances
Of course, it is
&#x200B;
UPD: Looks like our gov wants to allow dual citizenship "*with EU countries, countries of the world that are friendly to us, that do not pose any threat to us, and the list of these countries (...) will depend on some criteria"* according to our MFA Minister, but *"a number of restrictions on dual citizenship will be imposed on members of parliament, ministers and other officials
Belarus
They definitely can\`t do any harm to anyone except themselves
Don\`t thread on them, from Ukraine with love
Baltic countries
Still, it doesn't save them from endless jokes generated by two puns in English
Well, there is more jokes about Belarus in Ukraine rather than in United Kingdom
And they are friendly
But you know, it's all jokes until *some eastern neigbour* desides that your country is too independent
Me neither
See, no one wants to insult Baltic countries:)
Nah, wait, I know one about estonians being slow
Find it pretty dumb
I find it a bit tactless to shout state secrets on the internets
Why would you mix wine with mineral water
Because it's just watered down wine
Why would you want to water down wine
How do we know
Did you try learning English in duolingo
So how well you learnt English with it
Plenty of them
Besides the spirits of pretty much everything - from forest (Lisovyk) to sauna (Bannyk) we also had werewolves (Vovkulaka), river mermaids (Mavka) and vampires (Upyr)
No articles in both of my native languages
But since articles in many languages show the gender of the word, we have 3 genders and most of the times you can feel what is the new word gender by the look of the word
Counterintuitively however, there are words that are written identically in Russian and Ukrainian but have different genders: собака (a dog) - f in Russian and m in Ukrainian
Also that "feel of gender" lets you down sometimes
I am a geography geek and I was devastated when I learned that Bangladesh is feminine regardless of how it looks
Slavic languages don't have articles so we don't have to think about it
Conjugating words can be a pain though
We have time, gender, number and form to take into account
Feels like masculine
No vowels in the end, no other signs of being feminine
But it is feminine in Ru and Ua, despite being masculine in many other Slavic languages
Earlier I would say "it happened in Bangladesh" as "це відбулося в Бангладеші", but apparently the correct way is "це відбулося в Бангладеш" which still sounds weird to me
In Ukrainian we don't conjugate foreign words mostly and their spelling is just transliterated
This has exceptions of course
For example, in Ukrainian you can form an adjective for any place to indicate a person or thing that came from there or their allegiance to it
So, taking your example, you can make бордоський(bordo|s'kyi s'kyi being the suffix indicating that it's from somewhere and the whole word meaning "from Bordeaux")
This is true only if the object in question is singular and male(male as in the gender of the word), if it's not you change the suffix to ська/s'ka for female singular, to ське/s'ke for neutral and to ські/s'ki for plural
So it is бордоський маляр(a painter from Bordeaux) but бордоське вино(wine from Bordeaux) and бордоські порти(ports of Bordeaux)
And all this wasn't even meant to be in our language initially because we just apply our rules to foreign words by doing that
Also foreign words are retarded because you have to take into account their gender when conjugating the words around them
And to put a cherry on the top of this cake of grammatical madness, the words in our language can shift their meaning within sentences due to additional context, forcing you to switch the way you conjugate them and the words around them
So going back to Bordeaux, "Бордо" as a noun signifying the region in France has neutral gender
Meaning that you conjugate surrounding verbs and adjectives accordingly
Let's take "Бордо розташоване на півдні Франції"(Bordeaux is located in the south of France)
Here "розташоване" is the word "located" conjugated in the present time, neutral gender, singular number and according to it's group of verbs
But should you change the meaning of the word to, say, a nickname of some girl it's gender changes to female so we get " "Бордо" була розташована на першому поверсі цього будинку"("Bordeaux" was located on the first floor of this building)
Now "розташована" is the same word as "розташоване" but of female gender
If people get confused over the words' original gender, this just puts the last nail in the coffin of bullshit peculiarities of our language
In conclusion, our language is bullshit, I can rant on and on about why it's retarded, I love my language and I'm sorry for writing this giant wall of text
I had the same problem for the longest time ever
We like to omit "the", "a", "an" wherever because we don't have them in neither our language or any neighbouring language
You could also notice him omitting "is" or "are" because in Slavic languages it is common to omit the word "be" and it's forms depending on context
Yeah, according to online dictionaries Bangladesh is feminine in Russian and Ukrainian but masculine in Polish and Croatian lol
I have no idea honestly
Happy to oblige
Our language is indeed very interesting and even with my mediocre high school level knowledge of it I can't stop talking about it once I start
Especially since it's pretty uneven and there's some parts where everything is absolutely logical and orderly with few exceptions(like basic conjugation outside of the sentences, word formation, lexicology, phonetics etc) but at the same time there are parts that go absolutely bananas(advanced conjugation, syntax, punctuation, semantics and dialectology) and those that don't have any rules at all
In Ukrainian you are to remember each and every stress of each word there is out there because they have no rules behind them
This is obviously bullshit as modern Ukrainian has 256 thousand words
This is excluding ancient Ukrainian and obscure dialectical words
You can't physically remember them all so even the best philologists make mistakes with stresses sometimes
But I got carried away again, I'm happy enough I was interesting
We’re not russia (most Americans think we’re the same thing) :(
Being trafficked by Czech
It depends on the weather before this particular moment I decide what to wear
After it's been warm (+25 C) and sunny for several days, +15 C doesn't make that much of a difference
You might shiver in short sleeves and shorts, but overall you're fine
Although in spring, when it's usually +13-15 C and sometimes +18, you stick to padded vests or light jackets and sheepishly take them off if you go on a picnic
* Restoring army capability
* Decentralization of goverment  - more money now stay in regions
* e-gov services development (neeed an improvement though)
* solid pro-West course, at least for now
The most important thing as for me is awakening of national spirit and a start of active national identity development
I'd call it overall **national Renaissance**. Ukraine is becoming Ukraine instead of the UkrSSR
In fact, what we have:
- strong Army, initially launched almost from scratch by volunteers
- language quotas, decommunization, decolonization - Ukrainians finally feel we live in Ukraine, not another Russia (tho there's still a lot of work to do)
- I'm not religious, however, I understand the importance of Ukrainian Independent Orthodox church, which got started by the previous gov, the importance for the Ukrainian identity
- liberalization - e.g., finally LGBT parades were processed peacefully, not only in Kyiv, receiving enough support from police, Poroshenko's party was the first to embrace gender quotas
- improvement of economic and cultural ties with the Western world, due to our refusing from degrading Russian partnership and due to visa-free regime with the EU
- infrastructure development, technological development
Agree + I would add:
- overall **national Renaissance**;
- language quotas, decommunization, decolonization;
- tons of new Ukrainian music, books, shows (on YouTube), and other interesting projects
You just don't know our brainwashed naselenie
Yeah, sorry that we exist, Hungary
Can't say since I refused Russian-language content after 2014
For my eye, it's certainly Ukrainian
We consider it ours, Ukrainian and Qirimlar land, with no exceptions
However, we clearly understand it's a conservative shithole with outdated Soviet infrastructure and with mainly pro-Russian inhabitants, so integrating it with Ukraine will be challenging
Major part of content on radio and TV is obliged to be in Ukrainian by law
I understand it's very ridiculous to put quotas on our own language in our own country while other countries put quotas on minority languages - but that's our ridiculous post-colonial situation
There were funny discussions while the quotas were being developed
Owners of radio stations got butthurt because they played low-quality Russian pop music and were fine with that and didn't want to change anything
Their argument was "there would be no Ukrainian artists to play". And you know what
Since quotas took place, numerous great Ukrainian pop-artists were discovered and I can now enjoy high- and middle-quality Ukrainian pop while in Uber, instead of Russian shitty music
And the thing is there's always been great Ukrainian artists, media owners just were lazy or prejudiced against Ukrainian to change anything
I [like Wolski] if it makes it easier for you
>basically breaking internetional treaties about the rights of minorities
The only ridiculous thing is that I was obliged to get education in Russian in Ukraine, not in Ukrainian which is Native to me and the official language
And that's still the case
Who's the minority, really
Every comprehensive person understands that it's our fight with Russianization, not minorities like Hungarians and others
We all are for multiculturalism
However, Hungarians of Ukraine should receive education in the official state's language for their own sake - so they can integrate into society of their country
Thanks
Will do
I hope the situation will change
I really want Belarus be free and based
\> Ukraine no longer does \[protect the rights of minorities\]
Any International court's judgements
Links please
Because the buzz of Putin's lover Orban is not an argument at all
I know well that Trianon revanchism is an unofficial mainstream policy of your country, please don't act a fool
Our minorities feel well and are free to preserve their identities
Contitutional Court of Ukraine accepted our school law as Constitutional
However every Ukrainian citizen is obliged to know Ukrainian (surprise
It's not forcing, it's just common sense
And, IMHO, when Hungarians tell us what to do with our citizens, it's just your revanchism about Transcarpathia, which you confirm by telling us to refuse from our territories and citizens
Meanwhile, we aren't imperialist at all and, for example, don't try to make Poles accept Ukrainian as a second official language since there're millions of Ukrainians in Poland
Stepan Bandera he led brave insurgents against Soviet and German Fascist hordes
Not enough
When it comes to youth slang, in Russian:
* Topovyu, top - the best
* Pochilit' - to relax, chill, spend time
* Randomny - random
* Lol is used in everyday spoken language, pronounced as one syllable
* Creepovuy - creepy, scary
I can come up with much more
President Zelenskyi and his party's electional campaigns
Is it still a thing in Russia
They still have better condition and lower price than in Ukraine
Pretty everything in government education system
Cause it's just outdated Soviet "education" system, the only difference: the red is (not so skillfully) painted with yellow-blue
However, there are not so bad and quite modern private kindergartens, schools, unis, etc
I\`m in college and im being told ancient shit instead of Computer Engineering
Not really Europe, but Moroccan oil if just fucking amazing
We went to this restaurant in Fez's Medina and the restaurant was, to be fair, pretty expensive (about 14 EUR for a dish which is very high for Morrocco) but literally everything was so awesome
I remember there were some things made with camel meat and it was bloodu delicious (I'm really bad with remembering names)
Too spicy for him

Annexation of Crimea, war in Donbas,  treating us like we are theirs little brothers, stealing and rewriting our history and much more
The only way to settle things down is deoccupation of Crimea, withdrawal of troops from Donbas and staying out of our politics

Taking neutral position in Trump impeachment
I meen when ever we could fuck up the country so big and powerful
There is no difference if we tell "Oh, Joe Biden's son is using illegal schemes for earning money in Ukraine" or "that orange man, Trump, used his power to get support from foreign country in future elections". It will be fun both ways
As for Kosovo, I think it is a wise stance
Especialy for Spain
I mean, if you fully support every separatist movement in your country it is okay
You can't blame for example, Katalonia, Basks, Andalusia, and whoever for getting their independence if you support separatists in other countries
Number 4 and 5 hurt me almost physically
You are right, but Russia uses the same logic to justify their clams over the Crimea
They say that people of Crimea also fleed from central government that opressed them
Funny thing that Ukrainian government didn't recognise Kosovo and now I understand why
Yeah, everyone does
I've never seen any person here who would keep eggs outside of the fridge
Actually I didn't know you can do this, it's unusual
Never kept them outside fridge, as I always thought they would go bad faster if you store them in the room temperature
Excuse me
Green tea with milk is also a thing, it just needs to be very strongly brewed
We're not really portrayed in the movies (not talking about Chernobyl here), but when we do, there are two general problems:
All of the Ukrainians speak only in russian
Of course, 65-70% of the Ukrainians actually do, which piss me of so much, but there are a big amount of people who speak in the language of the country in which they live
So it would be better if Ukrainian characters speak Ukrainian in movies
We eat only our national food
I learned to ride at 3 years old
At 5 already rode around my neighborhood with my "bike gang". I still use bicycle as my primary vehicle during spring and summer, even though it is dangerous in Ukraine as cycling lanes or roads are almost non-existant here
Yeah
At, like, 5-6 years
I dunno, maybe 5 or 6
Now that I remember it, I was learning to ride in a very remote village where I used to spend summer
I biked all over the country roads all alone at that age, in a mind-numbingly poor and undeveloped late 80's Ukrainian countyside
I’m the most boring gamer in the world
I like games from Quantic Dream and also games such as “Papers, Please” and “This War of Mine”. I would like to see a story driven game set during time of war where the characters are not soldiers, but just ordinary people
That, and also more Cold War themed games
Perhaps a game which tells the story of the Isdal Woman, a 1970 Cold War murder mystery in Norway which was never resolved
Ukraine in 17th century
Poles - "lyahi", Russians - "kacapi, moskali"
>Slavic people
>Tschusch
I've never heard of it
What does it mean
All of historical periods in our history were terrible
XX: UPA
XVII: Cossacks era
XII-XIII: Principality of Halych-Volyn
IX-XI: Kievan Rus
Pretty everything
* Scythia-Sarmatia (though it's not so relevant to Slavs)
* Ruś
* Grand Dutchy of Lithuania, Żemaitia and Ruthenia
* Cossacks and haidamaks within Rzecz Pospolita
* Cossack state Hetmanshchyna, 17-18 c.
* National Rennaisance in 19 c.
* Ukrainian Revolution, Ukrainian People's Republic and Ukrainian State (of hetman Skoropadśky) during 1910's
* Cultural Rennaisance during 1920's in the Ukrainian Soviet Republic
* Struggle of UPA and OUN for Independent Ukraine against both Nazis and Bolsheviks
* Dissidents during Bolshevik's occupation of Ukraine
* Period of political struggle for Independence during perestroika and early 1990's
* First Maidan, of 2004 - pro-democratic massive peaceful protests, called Orange Revolution
* Second Maidan, of 2013-2014 - pro-democratic massive not so peaceful protests, called Revolution of Dignity
* Current Russian-Ukrainian war and struggle against Russian terrorism
And it's totally fine to romaticize, I believe
Myths are a fundament of reality as we feel it as human beings
And national myths are a source of national strength
Moreover, a major part of our history is indeed a tough struggle for own freedom, against tyranny and anti-human movements
I'm proud
Wouldn't say so
Intermarum when
You are talking about events, not periods
And many of those events took place during the worst periods of our history
Oh, all of them were very interesting
We have many exciting things in our history
Just for regular people life was almost always pretty bad
Anything that ties Ukraine to the general European cultural space is usually seen as a good thing
I like to tell both local and foreigners the fascinating tale of how the Prince of Kyiv basically had relatives on both sides of the Battle of Stamford Bridge
(Google Gytha of Wessex and Elisiv of Kiev)
They/we used to like Norse culture a lot so nobody complaining
We even have an ancient Slavic word for that (Varyagy, [ that described mercenaries from the Baltic Sea
A lot of nationalists are proud of that posterity
Well, I would argue that I have listed solely events
And bad period doesn't mean we don't romanticize the struggle during the given period
Sorry, this is my shitty English
They still like it
Ducks, goose are pretty common
Quails are rare
Pigeons are not consumed at all
We also call asian style cooked duck a Beijing style duck and this is considered a delicatessen
Poultry is pretty big in my part of the country as higher summer temps mean that other meat types are too prone to spoilage, so 90% of the time meat = poultry
I also grew up in the countryside so had more access to different types of poultry than an average city dweller
Here some of the types that are more or less accepted on the table there, other than chicken:
* **duck**: smell funky when raw, but really amazing slow-roasted
* **goose**: a bit on the chewy side, not my favourite
* **pheasant**: basically gamey chicken, great on the grill
* **quail**: mostly grown for eggs, but tapaka style flat quail is top
* **pigeons**: pretty good in stew, not the city rat variety, of course
* **ostrich**: tastes beefy to me, works well done kebab-style
* **guineafowl**: really great bird to keep, yet absent on the mass market
* **turkey**: surprisingly it's only gaining popularity now as it's perceived as a *healthy* option
If you're really adventurous, you can *probably* go with a seagull, but that's already seafood territory IMO and that's a separate thread
Quails are way more common than ducks and geese in supermarkets though
in countryside ducks and geese are more common depending whether particular household has access to pond/river or grass field
in cities I would say it is not really common
agree with quail, it's way more common than duck IMO
just like ducks and geese, pigeons are way more acceptable in the countryside as no sane person would love a fried city rat
source: am from countryside, farmed poultry
In my family it’s more like special occasion dish, but it’s sold in pretty much every supermarket
From the non-occopied part - Kharkiv by far
They wanna lie to you how they got the best parks - it's complete BS and it has nothing but run down brutalist architecture
I'm a non-native speaker and I find Scottish accent to be much easier to understand than those incipherable English ones
IMO Scottish has very distinct pronunciation of many consonants that helps the Slavic ear a lot, whereas English accents often just mangle words to oblivion
Also there is a site called "Scottish English language corpus" with subtitled recordings of people speaking that helped me immensely to learn listening comprehension
It's because in Russian language the word "Родина" (motherland) is feminine
>the word "Родина" (motherland) is feminine
So what
It's translated "kin's land", not motherland
The diagonal thing is commonly called *winter ventilation* here
I don't even know what those poor people call it in summer
Those are the usual windows and balcony doors here
Millions of bigger and smaller businesses offer to replace your old-school wooden windows and balconies with the newer plastic or wooden ones with insulation, soundproof qualities, diagonal ventilation [and all] In a continental climate, those windows are a must
Newer buildings with apartments for sale often have completely stripped concrete walls and floors with a few wires here and there ([like this] but there's a metal door, and windows/balconies are insulated with plastic systems
Here if can either have old wooden windows (still with double glazing though), or this sort of windows if you ever upgraded them in the last 20 years
So they account for I think about 70% of windows in old commieblocks and 100% in any new construction
The specific window seen on this video will be concidered 'fancy' but not because of the mechanism, rather because it's obviously high-quality and with a nice faux wood finishing
I have similarly looking windows in the main room of my commie block apartment (very similar mechanism, pseudo wood finishing, three glass pieces for better insulation, and UV-reflective glazing) but mine are still much cheaper than the one in the video
Also these windows actually can switch between THREE functions: side-to-side, up-down and 'microventilation' where you put the handle at 45 degrees and the window pops open like in up-down position but it will only go for like quarter of an inch
Very convenient for winter when you still want to have some fresh air but it's too cold to have it open
Might well be, in which case it's even more in another price class than the aluminium profile stuff
I don't think I've ever been to a residential house with modern wooden ones
I don't know if Телебачення Торонто counts, since it's a full-fledged channel now with a professional crew and stuff, but it began with one guy
This is a very humorous political news channel and they have adequate english subtitles
There's no better way to learn about political situation in Ukraine and have a bit of a laugh (and a cry) at the same time
But what about TrashSmash
He's cool
Still is very strong
Not only greeting but also when you go
It is annoying but people believe this is some form of showing respect
>Are you a cat or dog person
I'm a cat person to keep it as a pet, but I like certain dog breeds like Bullterrier, Staffordshire Terrier, Doberman, Corgi
>Which do you think your country prefers
Cats, there are far more people fostering cats and feeding strays than people caring for stray dogs or wanting to take a stray mutt in
In the countryside, guard dogs live outside; only the smallest mutts are let in
Village cats, however, have all the privileges of chilling outside and then eating and sleeping inside
>Which do you think the continent prefers
Also cats
Ruthenian language
Speakers of it mostly live in Carpathian region
> I doubt anyone actually knows about the specific dialects we speak, like how different Bärndütsch and Baslerditsch sound
I don't even know how "Bärndütsch" and "Baslerditsch" sound
Not owning a car is ok, but not holding a DL could be a problem in the future if you would go travel and would want to rent a car for it
P.S. I'm reliant on my car because I use it everyday and travel also
Public transportation in Ukraine is shit
I live smack in the middle of a 1M+ city and my work is literally seven minutes down the street by foot
So no, my life wouldn't be ruined if I suddenly didn't have a car
In fact we have one car in the family and it's used by my wife much more frequently
But it adds a lot of convenience
Public transport, while ubiquitous and cheap, is kinda stressing and gross here
We also like to get out of the city on weekends and drive to some middle of nowhere and that's only possible by car, especially in winter
You absolutely need one here, because public transport here is awful
What can I say
Ha ha
Kyiv has metro
It makes public transport situation slightly better
Sarajevo and Belgrade
Sarajevo, 'cause of WW1 and Belgrade because of Yugoslavia
We have Rav-Kav (meaning multi line )
It's a travel card and you can pay with money you load in it or buy a monthly pass which costs about 50 euro in my metropolitan
when two persons on the streets of Berlin contradicted each other how to pay for the tram, we decided to walk and pay for parking :)
to be fair, public transport payment system is horrible in many EU cities
Why did you put Estonian in quotes

If anyone ask how much I make a year I'll have to make a pause to calculate it, since we always measure salary by month
Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other realms and territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith, Protector of the Realm
As a side note, old royal titles can get ridiculous
Here Nikolai's II one:

Yeah, that's too
Even when I was freelancing and paying my own taxes I still negotiated about after-tax payments, and tax was automatically added
So if I negotiated 1000$ per month, I would get 1100 or whatever so I get what I negotiated after I paid taxes

> Is the parto of Zelensky going to take part
nearly 40% of all seats in parliament by prediction
> Btw is he a good president
IMHO, same shit - different president
For now he play "president for the people" role , in the same time has huge oligarch stick in his arse
But people like to believe that he will change something for good
Sad, by they will be disappointed again
>Maybe they still hope that he will change something for good because he is president for a short time
They saw in that show that he will be "against everything bad, for everything good".
Problem is after election society will become passive ( again) or will have another trouble (like war back in 2014), so gov will go out of control again
>Btw what is his political position/ affiliation ? Would say he is left winger, right winger, a centrist or something else
Centrist, probably
He want to deal with everyone and uphold the interests of all
Could you explain the last fact please
I don’t agree with the first fact
I know Home Alone had been aired in Ukraine every year on Christmas, at least it was like this pre 2014

There are former-soviet camps of "play volleyball and drink" style, and scout-style ones, although less widespread
Not sure how popular it is right now, a decade ago it was a thing
Fun thing about it is that more or less rich parents typically just go abroad with their children, so population in camps is capped by income, unlike for example school
Yes, definitely, in fact my daughter was in one of them the last three weeks
She was absolutely happy to go there since the camp has a childrens' club sort of thing in the city where she's a regular so she knew a lot of people from there already
Yes definitely
There are camps from Soviet era, near the lakes or rivers mostly
There are many modern scout-like camps too
I think majority of kids have a summer camp experience
Well I don't really know all things rich people do, maybe they sent their children to camps abroad, or take vacations while children are at school, whatever
Matter of fact is that these soviet camps aren't considered fancy-shmancy and you don't need to pack your inferiority complex going there
It was
So does the 4th May, when I am writing that comment
The reason of that is Eastern holiday on Sunday and Monday
Also the 1st of May is a day off so it moves from Saturday to Tuesday
Idk, sounds strange to me
We don't use scissors with food generally
For pizza we use knives and sometimes pizza cutters (but most people don't have pizza cutters, so it's more common in restaurants)
In here we don't this
Almost all Ukrainians are conservative and still believe in vaccines, so there is no anti-vax movement (yet
well they are in schools and kindergartens at least
Does Putin count
Yep
We call Putin - Khujlo
Of course :)
Depends because we have been under foreign rule for a good part of our history but I guess It has to go to Stalin
I made a list some time ago, but I don't think I can find it now
In short, we have two separate classes:
* **Ukrainian Literature**, where we study Ukrainian classic literature as well as the literature of the XX century; I believe, modern students also study Ukrainian writers of the XXI century in their curriculum;
* **World** or **Foreign Literature**, which is everything you can think of: ancient, classic, and modern literature; poems and prose; Asian, European, American literature
It's usually divided by periods and genres, so, e.g., we would learn the literature of the Age of Enlightenment, then romanticism, then literary realism, then modernism, etc
The main goal is to understand the defining characteristics of different periods and the social/historical/political/philosophical/scientific basis for them to emerge
As for the literature itself, we have these textbooks called "*хрестоматії/khrestomatiyi*" which is a collection of literary works for the curriculum
Some works are shortened, some are excerpts; poems are usually complete
But some stories and novels we're being assigned to read in summer or on other breaks
I remember being bored out of my mind reading "Ivanhoe" and "The Last of the Mohicans" when I was 12-13 and in a summer camp
Sure, here are a few works that we read at school
Here's also a [link] to a collection of translations to English
"Eneyida" (1798) by Ivan Kotliarevsky
[Here] I wrote a little about it
"Eneyida" was the first literary work written in common people's Ukrainian
And here are some [illustrations] for the poem
"Do the Oxen Bellow, When Their Mangers Are Full
" (1880) by Panas Myrny
"Kaidash's Family" (1878) by Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky
"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors" (1911) Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky
"Forest song" (1911) by Lesya Ukrainka (a play)
Also, I used to be a junky for sad stories about the countryside and serfdom, so I liked Marko Vovchok's "Folk Stories" (1857)
Not all people like these (I mean, sad stories about poor villagers and serfdom)
You are very welcome
There's not a lot of them, but they exist
I rarely see one in the street, but there was at least one in every programming team I worked in
As for society view, most don't care
Maybe some of the older people will ramble a bit, but even that is becoming less common
Pretty sure it’s [Schedryk] known around the world as Carol of the Bells

Here’s a cover for it in [Turkish] and [Ukrainian]

Part of Russia/Same as Russia/Soviet Country
I think it's Ukrainian revolution of 1917-1919 that followed Russia's defeat in WWI
That's the first time we had independence in a long time and it left a lasting impact on our national identity as a separate nation
The obvious answer is the Ukrainian revolution 1917-1920, but also I guess that Khmelnytsky Uprising 1648–1657 had a huge effect on our identity
We have it but there must also be meat inside
They can be pretty tasty
I've seen a single KFC in Odessa, and it's in the city's centre
The Baltic states always seem like neighbours, also, Turkey, despite it's over the sea
Maybe because Turkey is a popular holiday destination it doesn't seem too far away
Lithuania and maybe Georgia (but we share Black Sea, so maybe you can say that we have border)

Do you have the possibility to work remotely using the Internet
I've seen a lot of Swiss customers who searched for remote employees for different jobs related to IT
Ukraine has this problem as well
Although all dogs in my area are neutered and have an ear chip
Locals love to feed them but don't adopt
A few reasons that contributed to this problem:
* there isn't any state registry of pet owners, legally no one knows when you get(or get rid of) one
* shelters are full and don't accept any new stray dogs
* irresponsible people - one of the example is when people adopt a dog, move to their summer houses("dacha") during the warm period and when it is over they just leave their dogs

But Austria is like second home for me (over 2 months in Vienna and Niederösterreich)
I think I’d choose Austria ️
Yes, in several types of situations:
* when I want to use a word, but only remember it in a different language or I know the word in one language and feel the appropriate translation in the back of my head, it's like a ghost, but all the words I'm able to articulate don't quite fit the ghost shape;
* when I know the thing, but don't remember the word in any language I speak; happens with complex words as well as with simple everyday words;
* when I vaguely remember the word appropriate to describe a particular thing or phenomena, but it's mostly gibberish; I wonder if such word actually exists or if my brain's just playing games with me
Finnish
Songs in that language sound very cool
"UA: First" former (UT-1) operated by the National Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine, to be honest, I never saw anyone watching it, they're really outdated and can't compete with private channels (most of which belongs to oligarchs)
We don't have specific words for "boyfriend"/"girlfriend" either but unlike in your language, we say "хлопець"/"дівчина", which also means "boy"/"girl". But it really isn't that confusing
And yes, we don't have a word for "sibling" as well
Also, what first was unusual to me while learning English and German, is that they don't have that many commas
We have so many rules for using those
For me, it's not that hard but is for people, who didn't study well or for foreigners
For example "Для мене, наприклад, це не є важко, але для людей, що не вчилися добре чи для іноземців, це важко зрозуміти".
Numbers were confusing to me only in the first month of learning German
But 5 months later, I still need to hear some numbers twice / think about it a bit longer to understand it
But your option is not the worst: when I was deciding between French and German, I watched a video about French numbers and was like NOPE
So here I am, happily learning German

As some people have mentioned, the Zaporozhian Sich
Cossacks had nicknames like "Break-the-Nose", "Kill-the-Wolf", "Forelock", "Coil-the-Tail", "Lil-Porridge", "Lil-Flute", "Bend-the-Misfortune", "Dangler" and so on, which now are typical distinctly Ukrainian last names
> The Zaporozhian Sich was a semi-autonomous polity and proto-state of Cossacks in the 16th to 18th centuries
[...]
> The name "Zaporizhia" refers to the military and political organization of the Cossacks and to the location of their autonomous territory 'beyond the Rapids' (za porohamy) of the Dnipro River
The Dnipro Rapids were a major portage on the north-south Dnipro trade route
The term "sich" is a noun related to the Eastern Slavic verb sech' (сѣчь) – "to chop" or "cut"; it may have been associated with the usual wood sharp-spiked stockades around Cossack settlements
[4]
> Zaporizhia was located in the region around Kakhovka Reservoir in today's south-eastern Ukraine (much of its territory is now flooded by the reservoir)
The area was also known under the historical term, Wild Fields
[\(c\)]
> incredible haircuts
and mustaches, it's all about mustaches
>Also connected to Slovaks
also in western part of Ukraine, mainly Lviv, fifth largest in the Empire at the time
How about Lil' Porridge
He might have started rapping early in life
There's no "Hungarian" part of Ukraine, the region where our Hungarian minority lives has the following ethnic composition as per 2001 census:
Ukrainians **1m**
Hungarians **151k**
Romanians **32k**
Russians	**31k**
Roma	**14k**
Slovaks	**5,6k**
Germans	**3,5k**
and since a lot of people have moved out since I doubt the numbers have grown for any group save for Roma
I do agree about it looking like Eastern Hungary though - areas of Romania with Hungarian minority also look the same
It's a fertile strip of land shared between 4 countries, so there are similarities, of course
No hard feelings here, I'm chill with whoever's trying to make a living here that doesn't involve smuggling cigs across either border regardless of their ethnicity or faith
I do get the historical reference, being a Ukrainian in Hungary, but Lviv itself was more Austrian than Hungarian, if we're continuing said reference
haydamak or haiduk, also a thing in Ukraine
Only an online shop
There were so many people trying to buy something in the first day, that the site is still a little bit laggy
That's more than Sweden has
That's a lot of ikeas
They also completely underestimated the demand and right now you can order delivery only for Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast
Since I am not from the capital, I had to order from a reseller (from Ikea Poland) one more time
Besides that, recently it was found that IKEA uses illegal wood from the Carpathian mountains
And deforestation is one of the main reasons for such serious consequences after recent flooding
Not the best launch in a new market
99% agree that we're eastern Europe and 99% are unaware of the fact we or any other country is supposed to be butthurt about it
Some people also incorrectly include us to [the Commonwealth of Independent States \(CIS\)] which Ukraine is not a part of, but most post-Soviet countries are, that is why people use the term instead of "post-Soviet" which seems like less and less relevant as time goes by
Like, you want to say "this actor is known in the countries where Russian is still widely spoken as a remnant of the Soviet rule" --> you say "in the CIS countries" instead
As I've already specified, it's incorrect for Ukraine and the Baltics
To exit, you need to enter first
> Two states, Ukraine and Turkmenistan, have ratified the CIS Creation Agreement, making them "founding states of the CIS", but did not ratify the subsequent Charter that would make them members of the CIS
These states, while not being formal members of the CIS, were allowed to participate in CIS
They were also allowed to participate in various CIS initiatives, e.g. the Commonwealth of Independent States Free Trade Area, which were, however, formulated mostly as independent multilateral agreements, and not as internal CIS agreements
Additionally, Ukraine became an associate member state of the CIS Economic Union in 1994 and Turkmenistan an associate member state of the CIS in 2005
Also
> [Ukraine] Has never been a member
Largely ceased to participate in CIS from 2014, and withdrew representatives from all statutory bodies of CIS in 2018 as a result of the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and Russia's involvement in the War in Donbas
&nbsp;
>Plus I don't think anyone outside 'CIS' even knows what CIS is
Yeah, I agree, but it fits OP's question
Some Ukrainians would answer with СНГ as in "we're a part of CIS" meaning that we're a part of some Frankenstein's monster made of various state formations which economics gravitate towards Russia, as opposed to the rest of Europe/Asia
Yes, but not right next to the entrance door - we have a hallway without any rugs or carpet, only linoleum, so we can walk with our shoes on there
The hallway is the neutral zone, but the rooms are shoes free
I have house slippers for myself and a few spare pairs of slippers for the guests
Eh, perhaps I just phrased it poorly
Most apartments have this buffer zone with a closet or hangers for the outer clothing, a shoe rack, and a tall mirror
[Something like this] Naturally, you walk there with your shoes on when you're about to step outside or have just entered the apartment (unless the shoes are really dirty from weather conditions)
That's the place to change into house slippers
Our hallway just happens to be 6 m long and 1,5 m wide, with some more space behind the corner
A friend calls it "a waste of space", since, despite the size, its function is still limited due to its narrowness
We used to have a carpet there but disregarded it all the time, so we've removed the carpet and now it's just linoleum which is easy to mop
But the rooms have carpets and they're for house slippers only (hope it makes sense)
We called a plumber once and didn't ask him to change into slippers, so he walked through our carpet-free hallway and stepped on the toilet rug with his outside shoes (instead of stepping on the tiles like a sensible being)
Ever since the rug had faint shoeprint marks that were impossible to remove, so we had to remove the rug instead
This is just one illustration of why our homes are shoes-free
Another reason would be the pure comfort of having just socks/light slippers on, but, judging from this thread, it's just power of habit
Our whole cuisine is poor people food
It was invented by commoners and is made of local ingredients: vegetables, wheat/rye flour, dairy, pork meat and lard, poultry, fish, various fresh and dried fruits
I think pastry and imported fish was something only landlords got to try
Borshch, varenyky, pies, porridges, were common, as long as people's harvest wasn't taken from them
Well, I never moved, but culturally and economically we became closer to Europe and further from Russia, so uh, this
It had been a sort of stalemate since 15-16, due to some agreements we stopped active warfare (they still bomb our positions with mortars though)
Recently, Zelenskyy came to power and he believes that with some concessions he could make a peace agreement and peacefully retake occupied land, but the opposition (including Poroshenko) state that we should have a deal with them, because they would probably trick us, take even more land, use poorly guarded borders to their advantage and many more, partly because we don't know the terms of that peace
Because of that, activists peacefully protest, by the motto "No capitulation
". Even more, because Zelenskyy is going to Paris for negotiations, opposition leaders already plan a new Maidan (revolution)
I might be biased in describing the situation because I do support the opposition
I also wanted to ask Americans and EU citizens: what do you think about the situation
Do you support Ukraine, Russia, or neither
All Slavic ones
Yes and yes
I watched the trailer, it was exceptionally good, so I'm waiting for the release
So "*burattino*" in Italian is a puppet
And Pinocchio is his name, right
In the tale as we know it, the main character's name is [Buratino]
* [The Adventures of Buratino] the movie (1975, Belarusfilm);
* [The Adventures of Buratino] the animation (1959, Soyuzmultfilm studio in Moscow)
The Italian movie reminds me of these, unlike the Disney animation

Individualism
We have it since birth with our genes
That means that people think only about own and loved ones’ problems and needs

So I think it’s quite compensated i dunno
Kyiv historically was the center of our lands because of the natural benefits which it gives to people who live here
The city is located on high hills right upon the biggest and most important river in Ukraine downstream was many rapids so to pass it you had to take your boat to the ground and move to a safe part of the river, what you can't do without the permission of lord who controls this land
From the other side, Kyiv is surrounded by a deep forest full of animals
What else do you need in the 4th century
PS: Dnipro was the highway to the richest and most developed countries of its time (Byzantine Empire, Mediterranean countries) so it naturally became the most important trade road in a region
And on the north, we have a big region of swamps, so it provides additional security to the city
Моя хата скраю, нічого не знаю (My house is at the edge, I know nothing) = I don't want to know anything [about it], I don't care

ITT: your whole life was a lie
Edit: Ukrainian was never taught formally to any foreigners until very recently because of that whole USSR thing, so I don't think we have this problem
The norms of teaching Ukrainian as a second language are only now being worked out and the language itself is undergoing massive transformation right now as more young people start speaking it, and generally younger people tend to communicate and engage with foreigners both for leisure and for business, so I think what foreigners learn is all over the place but still pretty modern and widely used by native speakers
Purely politically speaking, aside from the fact that's he's right: Man, he must be loving this, and wishing an election would take place a year early, so he could ride this thing all the way back to the Elysee Palace

Imagine being Ukrainian
Most maps have data for Ukraine
Some don't, but most do
Yes my biggest frustration with these maps is Ukraine usually shows as having no data, not bad results
In fact most maps on here only have data from EU countries, sometimes EU countries vs Russia which is always a fun time
I don't know if it's better when economy maps use that Credit Suisse Wealth per Adult Databook where their methodology for Ukraine was "okay, we sorta know what the 50 rich Ukrainians' wealth is, let's just fucking assume that the rest of the country has exactly zero assets despite 70%+ home ownership rates, and divide the 50 rich guys' wealth among the whole population of 43 million, thus obtaining the average wealth in Ukraine to be about fifty five bucks per adult".

Lo-Fi Map of Europe
Made in Photoshop, map from [mapchart
net] art from r/europe's Lo-Fi challenge
I've decided to include the drawings from Dagestan and Scotland as well, so they are marked with gray borders within their countries
As much as I'd love to include all of the drawings, I was afraid the map would be too messy
However, I just found out that u/mateiz3 already made a similar map earlier, so be sure to check out [their version] as well, it includes some more art
Edit: people seem to be really upset about Wales, I definitely would have included Wales if someone had drawn a separate lo-fi girl for them

As someone with a bit of understanding of Russian context I would say it is both a calculated and desperate move on his part
He released two extremely incriminating videos and what
Reaction inside Russian society has been mediocre at best, while he needs to maintain pressure on Putin to stay relevant
Therefore he knowingly flew in to get arrested
What he miscalculated, I think, is Russian people's passivity
Oh well
He can become another good Russian now for all I care
conspiracy theories aside: because his videos didn't create the upheaval he was counting on, while he needs to maintain pressure to stay relevant
it's a desperation strategy if you ask me
> without any democratic consent from the Crimean people
It just shows how little you know on the subject, and highlights that you should not be talking
The actual locals, Crimean Tatars, were forcibly mass deported to middle Asia after WW2, with thousands and thousands dying en route, then perishing in the wilds of Kazakhstan
Meanwhile, russian settlers were already flooding the peninsula (and this kept happening throughout Soviet period, resuming again after the occupation of 2014)
Do Ukrainians want Crimea
Not that much really
It's home of Crimean Tatars, our allies throughout history, and they're getting repeatedly, morbidly fucked by the Russians
Again
DUDE
Go take a history class before taking such stances
What is more of benefit to Ukraine is a period of chaos and instability in Russia, like we saw in 1991-1992
That's our cue
The issue is that this referendum was after armed military invasion
The referendum part is just a legalization of invasion in the eyes of the international community, and based on this thread, it worked
That's ok, our Security Services will have more work to do, but they can handle it
Lol, you have no idea what you're talking about
That's not political instability, that's called democracy
The fact that we have a deranged imperialistic neighbor doesn't change the fact that Ukraine has improved constantly over the past 30 years
[This] is the original Russian invasion claim
The Crimea and a few cities in the east is what they could achieve
We're not talking about specific regions, we're talking about legitimizing armed invasions
> Ukraine doesn't really have any land in Russia which is majority Ukrainian, unlike the other way around
Yes it does
Here's a map of ethnic Ukrainian [population] and the lower right portion still remains within Russia despite being more Ukrainian than some other parts of the country like Crimea (which was Tatar not Russian)
[Wouldn't you like that, cotton boy
There was no widespread secessionist movement before the invasion, and most seccessionist ideas were spreaded by russian military base
We should have kicked it out years ago, but corruption schemes on gas deals were more important

Regarding the 3 journalists from Ukraine
Well, it's a little more complicated than a simple number can say
One of them(Stanislav Aseyev) is actually imprisoned by the Russian puppet states/separatists aka DPR on the uncontrolled part of the Donbas warzone
The case with the other 2 guys are a bit more complicated,they kinda helped with creating some Russian propaganda channels but it's kinda muddy since it was during the initial months of war when everything was fuzzy and some people didn't understand what's going on i.e they maybe were unaware what the channels they were setting up would be used for

That's my point — even if it's 'bad' bu our standards they don't know it and don't feel missing out on something
Look
As you can see I am from a country that has revolutions every 10 years, so I guess you can believe me that we love our freedom
Nonetheless, I am still 100% sure that 'freedom over everything' is way overrated
Think about it like this: the currency is stable, the streets are clean, you have a job, you have a car, the medical care is free, you live in the city with all the modern attractions
What *else* do you need
Like, what do you need a free press for, if (if
) your life is decent enough
So what if your president is serving for 25 years and actually is a dictator
You don't feel it
And let me tell you, Belarus is fucking *clean* in every sense — you won't see a drunk on the street, everything is spotless, no 'graphic pollution' like ads on the streets, kebab spots and shitty coffee-trucks (it's porbably hard to explain to a European, so you can just [look] at how Kiev is today
), really high quality domestic produce and manufacturing
Out of the three neighbor nations (RU, BY, UA) Belarus is surprisingly the most Europe-feeling-like
So, with that in mind, tell me again why do you need a free press or elections
If it goes south — sure, I won't argue with that
But people *actually* like living there for the most part
It obviously has its downsides, but to me the only thing that matters is how people living there see that
And it's not like they don't have free internet access to read and discuss, it's just that there's nothing to discuss
I was surprised that my Belarussian friends knew more about Russian and Ukrainian politics than me, because it's so boring in their domestic political life they started watching our news
How is that bad
The thing is, imagine if there was suddenly no law against littering or drinking in the streets — I can guarantee you they wouldn't start doing it at large
They just *got used to it*. Now, if suddenly Lukashenko decides to hold an open, free, honest election, I still guarantee that he will win that election
It's not that people love him, but he's *okay* enough to have a stable economy and don't rock the boat
Sure, it's not as fast at changing and economic growth, but on the other side you get stability
People like that
As I said, it's somehow in their culture
People hold 'freedom of speech' too high
I think if given the choice a lot of people will gladly trade freedom of press and election for stability of being safe, well fed and knowing you won't end up on the street tomorrow
I can't pick between Prague and Budapest
I guess all neighboring countries will see an increase in number of medical tourists from Poland
What is the point of testing for  covid exactly if we don't have any specific cure for it
The problem is pneumonia so if a person has it a person has it, there's no reason to differ its cause, right
Genuinely curious
There's too many crazy people who would just get tested three times a day for no reason except for them feeling more safe
Full shutdown (tl;dr only food stores remain open) tomorrow
Yes very reasonable response for 5 cases over ~40 mil population, guess it's just those superior slav genes giving us almost complete immunity
What all those nights shows (ie Trevor Noah, Seth Meyers etc
) will be joking about now
Not only Trump is gone, but a Democrat has won and they wouldn’t joke about him
How did Czechs and Polacks manage to bring so many people into Belarus
Are they speaking on Bilorussian or rassian speaking sheeet
bullshit
All Bilorussian was discriminated in favour of rassian
Especially their language, history and culture
Opposition was humiliated
People speaking on Bilorussian language treated as opposition and landed in jail
Around 400 years ago, Ukraine's forest coverage was about 50% too
As I see these assholes could not even glaze some balconies
If they stop, then will be eaten by putins POMOIKA
This flag was the official flag of independant Belarus after USSR collapsed in 1991
When Lukashenko came to power in 1994 he returned the soviet flag and coat of arms and also gave russian language official status in a referendum in 1995

, also r europe:
And it's always shot high from the air, because for residents usually it looks like this:
I remember reading a story about them
I live in Kiev and we have a similar one, so its story begins as one architect realises that by the construction rules walls of a building don't have to be perfectly parallel, you may have as much as 6 degree slant between any two walls
So they made a few curved apartment buildings just for the sake of it and these ones (I think there are actually two of them) were build before the Olympics-80 and they wanted to build 5 of those to represent the rings, but it was quite expensive to build and maintain since it has almost a thousand apartments
It actually has more ground footprint than equivalent typical series
Judging from Wikipedia sources, they basically did it because they could
It's an urban legend though
According to Wikipedia sources, the architects just wanted to diversify the district with some sort of an "architectural dominant" and came up with this
These brainwashed sheep should go protest China, Russia and India

How will the politicians in Europe make money

We talk about the shitheads who literally want to kill people
Nazis don't need some justification from idiots on reddit to attack people
They do it since the fucking National Socialist party was formed
Pull your head out of your arse and go out of your safe space for once, then you maybe won't start defending fucking Nazis
> The American in this case is not confirmed to be a Nazi
He made a Nazi salute whilst under the influence of alcohol
I don't give a shit
I'm not a nazi when I'm drunk, I don't do nazi salutes or spew their propaganda when I'm drunk
Nazis do that
>I wouldn't be so quick to assume that he wants to exterminate jews without indisputable evidence
My evidence is that he is a fucking nazi sympathizer is the fact that he did the nazi salute
>But don't lie to yourself, not all Nazi's attack people
I don't care
They are shitty people
>I don't like Nazi's either
And yet you jump in, selflessly, to defend nazism
What a hero, the hero the nazis need
The idiot who prefers the status quo or the escalation from nazis because otherwise nazis might get hurt fee fees
>Defeat them through reason
Oh my god, sweet summer child
How can you reason against something that never came from reason
Nazism is not a reasonable stance, it comes from irrationality and everything can be bent to justify that belief
You joker assume that I never tried to reason with nazis
Fact is that you can't reason with them
Nazism is emotionally driven, and I am the enemy
I will be killed if nazism will get any hold of political power again (well, it tries it best in the USA currently and only came close in the country of my neighbors, France)
>I am out of my safe-space
I disagree
You are fully in your safe space
You defend people who will never target you
You are safe
>I'll be called a Nazi-sympathiser by the likes of you
I call a spade a spade and your hurt feeling are not something I give a rats ass about
Because at the end of the day I did not defend nazism and tried to justify genocide
>If anything my comment is more about 'saving' us from violence than it is about 'saving' them
Your comment is about sitting idly by and doing nothing
Worth jack fucking shit
I will not defend Nazism at any point, because Nazism is the ideology that stands for genocide and irrationality
So again, step out of your safe space for once
You might learn that being called a mean word is not the worst
You might also learn something about what Nazis did and why it is not a fucking hill you want to die on
So is pirating obsolete or you just personally dislike their ideas
This photo is staged, [of course] although they say that it's based on a real event
In soviets, the war heroes like him have been named "Stalin's samovars". Most of them have been banished from main cities starting 1948 and died alone in remote villages

>With solid help from the allies no less, as they feared the Italian communists more
I mean
probably justifiably so
Sure, from the 70's onwards, they came closer to the 'peace, love, puppies and democracy', and became the veritable relatively harmless "Eurocommunists". In the 50s and 60s, however, they were fairly typical [Soviet-style commies] This included support for the crushing of Hungary's revolution, for example (I'm sure Giorgio Napolitano would have liked to take that one back, but back then he was in support of whatever his Soviet comrades were up to)
So yes, Italian communists were absolutely a threat right after WW2, and the prospect of them crushing Italian democracy and turning Italy into a totalitarian Soviet satellite/ally were very real
...Is that meant to suggest that Italian communists were not as dangerous as I claimed they were
I think the fact that they had support from (and were thus beholden to) the Soviets makes them more dangerous, not less
Maybe there's some economic pain, the political climate changes, and suddenly this party beholden to the Soviets goes from 20-25% to 40%+ and starts governing
Their entire raison d'etre was to get into power and stay there, Soviet style
Don't you think this presented a danger to the West, and to Italian democracy
This photo was also banned during USSR times
If it is near the Binnenhof (and it seems it is), then I saw such a performance with my own eyes

And you forget about France reaction when Germany move army to Chechs border, they send ultimate to stop it, otherwise, France begin mobilization, and after this they start talk in Munich
Where Chemberland give them Sudets
> The USSR only tried to avoid war by concluding a nonaggression pact like others did
Every Soviet apologist in this thread conveniently omits the [secret part of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact] and the Soviet-German plans for didvinding the Europe (which came to fruition in 1940)
It was not _just_ the non-aggression pact
But you know that
Right
Victims of Red terror under Lenin would like to disagree
> In a half a generation we will have a brand new diagram, and we will laugh at this one like we laugh about people fearing the illuminati now
By your logic, you should laugh at Auschwitz
I just see no reason to branch this out
Stalin operated as a communist, the term stalinism was made up by the commies later to try and separate themselves from that shit
It's like if a republican party starts calling whatever shit trump will do trumpinism to distance themselves and pretend like he wasn't a member of their party
Of course not,both of them has done a lot of crimes,but saying that
>stalinism but not communism
is to blame,is from a descriptivist point trying to shift the blame/make stalin a scapegoat
Lenin, Stalin,Mao and many others called themselves communists(of course what they did differs from "a textbook definition",but the same goes for many things in our history (medieval feodals sure protected their subjects and always ruled with justice))
They described themselves as communists and since they pretty much set an example they are communist
IMO, it's the same as arguing that nazis weren't nazis because a real definition of national socialists says something else
> Yes, that's what I mean
It is already happening
The youngest generation sees Auschwitz and e.g. ancient Babylon as similarly abstract ideas
This is not half a generation
This is the third or even fourth generation
See, I've never heard the term Hitlerism, while I'm sure it exists
we still call it nazism and you don't see nazis walking around, pretending that hitler did his own thing and it has nothing to do with nazis
I live in a country which is probably the perfect example of a communism victim, but if we start calling each occurence a separate name we can make it look like communism wasn't that bad, just had a few bad people
I mean, it's just stalinism, leninism, berianism, holodomorism, gulagism nkvdism, kgbism, stazism happened to occur in the same period, just an unlucky coincidence for a cummunist party
good point about a single leader, they probably just didn't get their chance

Not to mention that public transportation is ridiculously expensive, and even in Copenhagen there's no land public transport except a few bus routes (why, oh why did they remove trams)
At least there's metro now, can't imagine how much it sucked before the metro was built
Overall, the city feels car-centric even with all the bike lanes
"Let's build NS2 to celebrate" - Germany
So, when Europe again to begin ''deeply concerned''?
"We are sorry, we only wanted to kill some Ukrainians" - Russia
"Oh, that was an unfortunate mistake
Please, pay more attention next time you are going to kill Ukrainians" - the understanding Europe
At least they could agree to stick to one version of lies to not embarrass themselves further
But that's not how Russia works
How the fuck is that an accident
It's a complex machinery and electronics aimed to kill and destroy large aircrafts
They *wanted* to take down a Ukrainian airship, it was a *coincidence*, not and accident, that it was not
Yeah so we have here a very precise missile that can take down a plane 12 000 meters in the air(!), so high a SU fighter can't fly that high, let's just accidentally shoot some stuff
Obvisouly they didn't want to take down any 'western civilized people' but they'd be pretty fine with it being a Ukrainian ship with Ukrainian passengers, don't call it an accident, it's insulting to the dead in the war and in that tragedy
> are okay with their government murdering 298 people
they are okay with their government killing many more people than that, even not only foreigners
You are talking as if Russians are immortal or something
> So either the Russian military is criminally incompetent, or the Russian government is a bunch of neo-imperialists and liars
[You see
Send in an international military coalition to kick out so-called "rebels" in cooperation with Ukrainian military
Keep on sanctioning Russia if it interferes
Block SWIFT for any transactions with Russia besides contract-based oil and gas supplies till Russia stops occupying a sovereign European country, issues official apologies for MH17 and pays compensations to victims' families
Completely shutting off Russia from SWIFT and the international banking system while showing clear and determined effort to rebuild the devastated European energy security, you would have them begging on their knees within weeks
But no, those 2 percents of profit are too darling for the EU elites and the Germans are too scared of nuclear energy to do anything
Oh believe me, they still absolutely do, it just depends on the perceived audience
They declare that there were no Russian troops in Ukraine with a wide shit-eating grin, like something to be proud of, sort of "Yeah we know we did it, and you know we did it, and we know that you know, and there is nothing you can do about it".
The above is for the near neighbors, Ukrainians, Baltics, Poland etc
However when the indended audience is expected to have some sort of "realpolitik" mind set (usually some right-leaning AND left-leaning Westerners who fancy themselves politically savvy), the stance changes to the alternative "Hurr durr Ukrainian nazis, need to protect Russians, land bridge to warm port, but what about America" bullshit
Belarus would go broke on trying to maintain that much border

You're also definitely in luck that the vast, vast majority of Russians have no idea that Finland used to be part of the Russian Empire

They want death to Ukraine, they are glad "Crimea is back" and want more conquest
They are absolutely racist and hate west (and especially USA) and Ukraine with passion

They are not “cool” at all

On one of our visits of Amsterdam one of our passports were stolen late in the evening
And our plane is at 7AM
To get temporary passport we would need to go to our embassy with the report from the police
So, we started to look for a police station and we learned that this bug city doesn’t have a police stations in all districts — it’s like 4 or 5 of our them in total
And Google maps was useless — it showed wrong directions to them, and also the stations work till 10PM, and after that they will not take any report, please come down in the morning
And on top of that, the guy inside one of the stations said that we need to go to the central one, it works 24-7
But nope, it was also closed, please come back at 8AM, said very polite guy over the intercom
It was right decision for us to come to the station at 9:30, because, apparently, central police station works from 10AM
Yeah, they were very very polite when took the report from us, but we learned that policemen there are volunteers
In our country police stations are in every district and they work 24/7, it was a little bizarre experience
Edit: apparently, some people thought that this is not a real story
Well, it is real, believe it or not
I guess losing the passport when your plane is in the morning, is not emergency, idk
I called the police, and they suggested we make it to the police station, because we really needed that report
But we arrived to the station at 22:10, or so

This year in March there is 75 years from mass massacre in Koriukivka, Ukraine - 6700 civilians killed in nazis punitive operation, the whole village was destroyed (1300 houses were burned down, only 10 survived)
The largest massacre in WWII
The more devastating is the fact that it was triggered by local partisans action couple days before - they attacked local Axis garrison of hungarians (80 Axis soldiers were killed there)
2 days later when the punitive action began being committed by up to 500 persons unit of SS and auxiliary police, the partisans were just observing; there was no order to step in (most of partisans were local, from surrounding villages)
Although there were ~5,5 thousands partisans in the region, most of them deployed in neighboring villages
But that was a kind of a tactic for partisans from Red Army command, there were only orders for doing sabotage and raids for killing the enemy manpower
No orders for protecting civilians

They are in fact hostages of Russian militants
It's sad but all too often hostages become victims when terrorists get eliminated
Ukraine tries to be as cautious as possible in this conflict
Here is [the one in Moscow] You are welcome
You can blame EU as much as you want, but Ukraine isn't part of EU or NATO
Honestly, they don't have reason to be involved, except keeping peace on their borders
Why would a Union want to get involved in more shit if it has major problems within
Bandera is dead, OUN is history, Tyahnybok is not even in the parliament, "elect nazis" is bullshit
So what else do you have, troll
We all know Ukraine is buffer zone between Russia and Europe
Its technically a battlefield and if EU wants to keep peace they will just spectate
I know it breaks our hearts but Russia still has firm grip on Ukraine and EU knows it will not escalate the conflict by simply spectating
There are nazis in the majority of countries of the world
And it seems that Ukraine has a [much less Nazi problem] than many other countries including Russia
Russia would not allow peacekeeping mission in Ukraine as it has major vote in UN
Sending military equipment and supplies is good, but won't help in long run
> Ukraine is still way far in meeting the Copenhagen Criteria
When you purge corruption and nationalistic ideologies out of governing bodies, then will Ukraine be able to join Union and possibly NATO
Long run but we'll make it

My uncle, who speaks ukranian/russian/english, took a trip to some caves in Croatia
Upon arrival, they were told that russian speaking guide will arrive with group in an hour, and the guy there could only talk in croatian
Uncle told him - kay, let's go, talk in croatian, just slowly
I was later told that you pick up like 90% of what's being said - if the speaker is slow enough
Bonus point: russian tourists dodged
I've been to Croatia shortly and I felt that, you guys are super chill and the country is fucking beautiful ! <3

You use a lot of words that are considered "old" here and not really used anymore, but are still understood
It's fun
As for music, it doesn't exactly fit the discussion because there isn't much language in there, but still check out ONUKA
I've recently discovered her for myself and just in awe on the music quality (lives on youtube preferred)
Without getting too political
A lot of Ukrainians feel very similar about Croatia
Because it's an example of a country that had to fight a similar fight for its independence, and succeeded admirably (that is, it's not only independent, but vibrant and free)
Don't push this old Soviet/Russian propagandist idea again
By that spoiled logic you may come to not tolerate any greetings and up to the most of the dictionaries' content at all in modern Europe, which is still under heavy influence of Russian bribed political establishment
For me, the only people still entitled to be shocked by the phrase are those who regard Ukrainian independence as a form of dangerous extremism, which is complete noncense
Russians themselves were the greatest Nazis allies at the beginning of WW2, with the common deeds included their friendly devision of Poland, and then outnumbered any other of ethnic groups within the collaborationist forces
So let's do not tolerate "Здравуствуйте, товарищи" as well, and so on, and forth
Oh boy, those things that happen in Poland's independent day  shouldn't be tolerated as well, especially in modern Europe
I talk about far-rights march
Every single year
Do you view Piłsudski as a genocidal barbarian dictator or as a national hero who saved Poland
That's a rhetorical question
Nazi has so much connection to Bandera, as Piłsudski
Come on, you share me a 1 minute read article, where it clearly says that "Jewish groups have linked Bandera's followers to the mass murders of Jews". Bandera's followers and Bandera are different people
There was Polish collaborators as well, but I don't state that every Pole is a collaborator
You just have to use a bit of critical thinking and it becomes clear
And yeah, check this [book] as well as [all nations make mistakes, even Poles]
who said anything about glorification lmao
If you care enough about Ukranian take on Volyn, please check this video
It has Polish subtitles If you click add them and then choose Polish
I\`m interested to hear what you think about this video
Of course you did not offend Russia, but rather complimented them
Also for Ukraine it's not really offensive too, since this area is the origin of the whole "Rus'" and "Russia" name, which later [was hijacked by Muscovites]

You read about the part where the people they caught are alleged to work for Russia (and they say they have good evidence of it), right
Regardless of this, Russia *is* a terrorist state which murders its opponents in the West, never mind Ukraine (where, among others, it murdered almost 300 Dutch, Malaysian and other civilians)
so, Ukraine faked death of russian journalist, who was out of favor in Kremlin, who was probably ordered to kill by russian FSB
but still blame Ukraine

There's Russian proverb like that, except it's the stick that shoots
> From my understanding, it was Russian-backed and directed revolutionaries that shot down a civilian airliner due to some sort of mix-up
"Revolutionaries", right
No, "revolutionaries" can't learn to operate a Buk SAM complex on a Sunday afternoon
It takes many months of professional training by an actual army, and it's a team of people, so it was Russian army soldiers in a Russian Buk
The real issue is not of course to simply admit a mistake and pay out compensation, the real issue is to admit engaging in an undeclared war of aggression against another sovereign state
>I'm not denying Russia does some shady shit, I'm just saying they aren't that much worse than our "allies" to the west
That's the most successful part of their propaganda effort - muddy the waters, convince ordinary people of this false equivalence between Russian imperialism and America's imperfect, sometimes criminal, but nevertheless a lot more restrained foreign policy
Especially in Europe, especially in places like Slovenia
It's mighty convenient to put "allies" in quotes when you know your ass is protected from any possible serious war not really by Slovenian military, but by the very allies to the west you denigrate
I guess you're meaning the [bottom right]

It's in fact remnant from soviet times and become some sort of mentality
Also add fact that we for the last 20 years wanted to be buffer state - not with Russia, not with the West
Look at countries who chose their side after the collapse of the Soviet Union  - West aligned one mostly doing good, they have problems, but compare to us they are doing good
Russia aligned - yes, they have "stability", but they slowly stagnate as for me

It severely limits the ability of people to coordinate, and to even stay updated on the events
E.g., there's a telegram channel where people send reports of ongoing events at specific places (police moves, clashes, points of gathering etc)
Without mobile internet access, with severely limited unstable broadband, and no media but state media, it gives a huge edge to the police on the streets
On that topic, I can't recommend Bloodlands by Timothy Snyder enough for a good bird's eye overview of what Eastern Europe went through in the 1930s and 1940s.

[Just as reminder to europe]  **highly NSFW** (blood and death)
Over 100 peope were killed by (most likely although not proven) russian or prorussian snipers in the center of Kyiv, [it all began as a pro EU protest with EU flags] Now nobody gives a single fuck and Germany [still launders russian money] I can understand them doing it because we are just some scrubs from a 3rd world country nobody cares about, obviously, thats understandable, but i cant understand them being friendly with russians after MH17
Germany even voted Russia back into PACE after they got kicked out form it for downing a plane (**4** germans also were on board)
Im getting more and more dissapointed whenever i see this flag, it now reminds me of grief and sadness and every passing year it gets me more depressed when i realise we are nowhere near in joining EU and probably will always be against Russia on our own
I was really surprised to find google have been pretty thorough with my city in Ukraine, i mean they even have my home and i can see my windows on the 8th floor, the fact they drove here to the small yard with  dead end confuses me, like why, they need to make like 3 turns from the main street to get here, i was probably just chilling home and totally missed a visit from google car, fascinating and kinda creepy too

Not so far ago EU and USA fuelled a coup in Ukraine

It's nice to see that not all Russians are brain-washed and blinded with their love for Putin
> Are there elections coming
yup, in March and somewhere in middle of autumn
> How do you think things got better for Ukraine
In what way
We became the centerpiece of international politics and I believe our government utilized it pretty well
We moved much closer to Europe: visa-free travel, financial reform made investing outside and inside Ukraine easier, many internal standards and regulations were changed to follow EU instead of Russia
Even cultural shift was enormous with Ukrainian celebrities replacing Russian ones, even the church became independent from Russia (500-year challenge)
People working in the industries that could take advantage of the shift (IT services or export-oriented ones) are benefiting immensely
Those who relied on Russia (metallurgy or heavy industry) suffered but Russia made many of those regions unlivable anyway

Fun facts
EU has been working on actively reducing its CO2 emission since 80-early 90th (While USA kept pumping more and more) and yet economy is still standing strong, and Germany manufacturing is huge
Maybe trying to reduce pollution you do, doesn't outright kills your economy, unlike what some people claim
Also thanks based EU for trying to do at least something to combat this problem ;_;7

Government closed metro, so people started using buses and trams, so they are overcrowded
Despite the regulation that buses and trams can ride only 10 people per carriage, which obviously doesn't work
Russia's best option is to do nothing and wait
Armenian current leader came to power after their velvet revolution when the nation protested fraudulent elections won by the corrupted pro-Russian candidate
In all such cases, new leaders were becoming Putin's personal enemies endangering his regime, and all of them ended in wars
Russia directly invaded Georgia at first, then Ukraine
Armenian case just gives Putin a lucky chance to do war with the third party hands
All they need just to wait a little bit until poor military and economic results lead to the revolutionary leaders get discredited and bring Armenia back again into brotherly Russia suffocating claws
Anther Russia's bonus is that the Belarus and Navalny issues are getting to the background at least for a while

Ukraine is in danger actually
Our healthcare system wouldn't handle even a couple of thousands of sick people with coronavirus
In addition, we have plenty of citizens, who work in Italy
Now most of them have returned back home
Our only protection is strong quarantine, which I hope we got in time
Edit: grammar
> If we compare to Ukraine which has or at least close to single digit  infections in a population of 42m and they're way better prepared then  Sweden
Ukraine and be prepared, yeah right
Trust me, we are not prepared
Our number is low because we didn't do many tests, as soon as we start doing test en masse we will be at least at Poland level (if not worse)
Thanks, will fix it
Sorry for my bad English
I wonder if this explicit dictatorship move will finally persuade Germany to stop the Putin's beloved political project called Nordstream
Putin is totally unhinged
Oh no, anyway
Him staying in Germany would absolutely undo his previous work while also killing off quite a lot of protest momentum (they wouldn't happen in the first place)
It's not about personal safety, I assume
One funny thing is that at least 1/3 of Russian households still don't have gas

Well, for non-EU students it's about the same(or higher) in [Denmark] too, and in Sweden as well: my kid was eye-balling some unis there, and for Ukrainians it'd be about 350000-400000 SEK for the whole course in biotech, big data or gamedev-related courses
Meanwhile Poland offers their education for as low as $500-1000 per semester, even less for talented kids, but the thing is I doubt (especially after talking to their representatives at recent 'Education in Poland' promo-event)  Polish education in those matters is much better than Ukrainian, and Ukrainian is just meh at most

Uh, that's one way to put how Moscow promised to uphold the Pskov independent democracy in exchange for sending whatever prince they wanted to govern them, and then betraying the agreements and showing up to negotiations with an army and a puppet governor
And then forcibly changing the local laws by taking the city's officials hostage and throwing them into a dungeon
And a century later drowning the lands of Novgorod and Pskov democracies in blood and murdering the bishop of Pskov (by the hand of Tsar himself)
We are all brothers with one language and one culture
Everybody who disagrees with this great message are fascists

You've portrayed Ukraine so accurately: it shows not only our country's physical state but emotional too
Jokes aside, looks cool
Yo what the fuck
Trying pull ass out from the swamp
True
Without the Russia flair I would assume that this is a funny dark joke, but with the Russia flair it reads like a threat
Clearly they were referring to Russia not holding back and invading Ukraine in Crimea and Donbas
Also, of course we hate your government, not your people
We know that you don't have a real say in your government and that your government does nearly as much to hurt its own citizens as to hurt neighboring countries
It's not russophobic for us to be upset about the people your government has killed and oppressed
Yes, a few people lump your people together with your government and that leads them to wish death on random Russians
That's  despicable of them and they are absolutely wrong to do it
They're also a very small minority
Most of us just want your government to fuck off and die and for your people to have the same freedoms and opportunities we want for ourselves
A coup d'etat is a forceful change
There were large scale protests against Yanukovych's corruption and abuse of power
Yanukovych agreed to a compromise on reverting some of his changes and holding early elections
The next day he abandoned his post and ran to Russia
No one forced him out of office
Seriously dude, I get that in Russia you are completely inundated by propaganda, but you should do your own reading about it
The small beginning of the protests (including the chant you shared) was about preferring the EU to Russia and being upset that Yanukovych was choosing closer ties with Russia over the EU after promising closer ties with the EU, but the main protests had nothing to do with Russia and everything to do with Yanukovych and his government being extremely corrupt and abusive
And honestly, we will never know how Crimeans would have felt about the new government after the early elections
There wasn't a lot of polling done before Russia attacked and stole their opportunity to have a say
It's possible that Crimea would have wanted even greater autonomy than it already had or even independence, but again, we'll never know because Russia attacked before anyone got the chance to find out what Crimeans wanted based on the small change in government
Polski jabka, dobre jabka
Aggressive fascist junta with support of russophobic Western allies attacks poor innocent Russia
Looks very

Blaming the victim is a tried-and-true KGB trick used by Russia till our days to justify attacking Russia's neighbors
Unfortunately there are too many naive people in the world still believing Russia and whitewashing its dictators
If you want to compete you have two option: you either get yourself on the same level as others, or
you can try to get others on your level
The Russians are obviously doing the later
They know that they can't compete with other by standards of living, prosperity and freedom, so they come up with different types of bullshit
Funding different right-wing parties is one of them
The outright lies are common in Russian propaganda
Sad thing that nobody still acknowledges that this type of shit is a type of warfare
Being half-Russian living in Ukraine I witnessed all this hysteria and hypocrisy on the Russian federal channels, when what we call ATO (anti-terrorist operation) unfolded 2014-2015
This is really disturbing

Also, isn't the new transcription for the city Kyiv
I may be wrong ofc, just wondering
War on three fronts (Africa, large Eastern European, and some relatively passive till 1944 Western Front), having a delusional leadership that cared more about the extermination of population than winning a war
No chance
Yes, absolutely, after the prison of nations dissolved we have had the best time in our history since at the very least 16th century, and that's even accounting for the current Russian invasion, shitty economy and corruption, this is still the best time Ukraine ever had, tells you quite a lot about our history
They did
The fire on Khreschatyk street raged for almost a week and the street was completely destroyed
Fuck Soviets
And then caused his own genocide
What a hero
You surely do a great favor to our country representation out there with all those "alternative opinion" comments
[Holodomor]
Nah, play into russian narrative about Nazis, cause that's definitely who took over Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea
Cause it's Nazis who repressed Ukrainians in 1917-1921, 1922, 1932-1933, 1937, 1939-1945, 1947, and, you know, the rest of the century till today
Nazis thing for sure
It was deliberate and man-made though
He didn't save us and certainly did more harm than good
Period
Same azov and right sector that saved Mariupil' from the actual fascists
Why don't you tell me what you think of liberators co we can settle the case and report you to SBU ;)
You literally can't see the irony yourself - an occupier comes to your land and you play into his narratives because you don't see the USSR as an occupier too
I guess none of your relatives died from famine, or in Finland or Romania for a piece of land for Stalin
Oh, right, that was before the so called great war, it doesn't count
And I didn't death threat you, I merely hope you will change the way you perceive russians when the collaborationism law goes into effect
That, or you Fanta/nesquik will come from your water pipes just like in Crimea
Ah yes, priest blessing the hospital, so catholics can praise god (and not the doctor) when a doctor with 50 years of experience treats your cancer
^^^which ^^^god ^^^gave ^^^you
Sure
A priest sprinkling some water on a dummy is totally on par with fucking ISIS
And a couple hours before that what now is Greek flag was a battlefield between red and blue
Good thing it resolved peacefully
Just to illustrate:
[this was a residence of Ukrainian president Yanukovich] and Ukraine is much more poorer country than Russia with approximately same level of Corruption
When i've been there back in 2014, it took me about 4 hours of walking around, and i still didn't visited all the corners - missed the Zoo and few other buildings inside the territory of the estate
Wow
It's incredibly ugly
Seriously, it looks like a hodgepodge of styles and shapes
Yeah, it is huge, me and my friend hung there for a half of a day and did not visited all the stuff
And Yanukovich was a president of much poorer country than Putin, and Putin is at power for something about 18 years, and Yanukovich was 4 years president and some 3-4 years as Prime minister
Basically Yanukovich was a beggar comparing to Putin
Godspeed
Lol tell me about 1940s...its 2020 my parents live on 70 dollars pensions, like most pensioneers here, they cant imagine eating like this without someone helping, i have absolutely no desire to become old and we are literally neighbouring countries, but we definitely live in different centuries, they wont throw away any of the things you show, most would just take it home instead of throwing it into the bin or sell for lower price
Imagine if supermarkets started selling expired products, I doubt it will be better alternative (even though some still do, not in EU though)
You've got the ukrainian upvotes the moment you used the correct romanized form of Lviv
I assume they were either polish(Lwów) or russian(Lvov)
But don't let them discourage you
Edit: Oh, they criticized the use of "w"s instead of "v"s. I was referring to people using the russian-influenced "Lvov" instead of the correct "Lviv". "Lwiw" and "Lviv" doesn't seem like a big difference to me honestly
That name is already trademarked by Russia
In Ukraine it's around 30 people
Yes that's true
Primary education is not available here
Such is life in eastern Europe((((
It is so vegetated
It reminds me of The Last of Us
Put some wracked cars and smashed windows and it's done
Hit them with the FineHammer
And the only one we had is the Columbine imposer on annexed territories
I know it is a joke but between Northmost point of Texas and southern Poland there is enough Latitude for another Texas

Thank you for the educational part Haaretz, but is it related to the incident
You could have added that "Poland,  which is a country where there invented vodka" it would be just as relevant

"The discovery of the cause of coeliac disease may also be partly attributed to the Dutch famine
With wheat in very short supply there was an improvement at a children's ward of coeliac patients
Stories tell of the first precious supplies of bread being given specifically to the (no longer) sick children, prompting an immediate relapse
Thus in the 1940s the Dutch paediatrician Dr
Willem Dicke was able to corroborate his previously researched hypothesis that wheat intake was aggravating coeliac disease
Later Dicke went on to prove his theory
My mom suffered a forced famine, as in, government agents would come and take whatever they wanted and you could say nothing or get shot
My grandpa added extra layers of wall on their home for hidden grain storage
She instilled me with the idea that all that is served is to be eaten, no matter how full you feel, how much you already had during the day

And I felt like there's a lot of people living all around my places
Can't say for other countries, but for Ukraine this country is utter BS
Ukraine has [about 460] cities (міста), each more than 1000 inhabitants - and that already exceeds the number of the dots for Ukraine on the map
But Ukraine also has about [830 small towns] (селища міського типу), which also have more than 1000 inhabitants each
And there also are villages (села), some of which have more than 1000 inhabitants
There actually are [almost 100 villages] with more than 5000 inhabitants in Ukraine, and I was too lazy to look up how much more with *just* 1000+.
If the map was correct, Ukraine has to be all shiny there
So I can't say whether the map makes any sense for other countries, but for Ukraine it is totally made-up nonsense
Hutsul = Rusyn = Ukrainians
They never leave it, it's Eastern Europe
Rusyn is generally old name of Ukrainians
Rusyn means Son of Rus ( Kyivan Rus, Ruthenia )
And now it almost not used in order to avoid misunderstandings with rassians (Moskovians)
And yes there are for ex Lemky, which are also Rusyn
But they are not Hutsul

It would be a good idea to setup a protest camp, where people take shifts - it sends a stronger message in my experience, and it will be easier to gather people there at any time necessary
You should occupy an area permanently, so that government doesn't feel in control anymore

Oooh Ireland why are you not in Schengen zone
Yeah, I understand why, it was more of a rethoric *why*.

236 in Ukraine lmao, is it average between millions of poor people and our president
The data is a bit outdated
June, 2018, Ukraine, official average salary: 9141UAH ~ $350
Oof
Yeah, that's a good point
And you can also filter per sector; for example, in Ukraine an experienced software engineer would be making around 2200EUR per month, which makes you basically a tiny bit short of a king (a very good apartment, 70 sqm in the center of Kiev will be 800 EUR absolute tops)
Instead in France you'd be 2700-3400 and paying the same for 35 sqm, a fuck load of taxes, plus everything else is 2 to 10 times as expensive
In Ukraine I could be completely careless about money, in France I can't.
The data is a bit outdated
June, 2018, Ukraine, official average salary: 9141UAH ~ $350

Germany OTOH is the main Russia supporter in the EU both financially and politically

Our government recently introduced the first comprehensive app in the world for e-Documents
Now you don't need to have your plastic ID on you, you just need your smartphone
It works in most situations where your ID would be required: police, post office, domestic travel, buying tobacco or alcohol, etc
So that's pretty progressive, I would say
In 1917, Mykhaylo Hrushevskyi thought that People's Republic of Ukraine doesn't need an army (even thought there was a possibility to create a big, powerful army)
Partly because of this decision, Ukraine became independent and acknowledged around the world only in 1991
The 2 times it got betrayed and thus got divided by Poland and Russia

Well hello there
I was looking for this one
Poor people live in a house or apartment that still looks just like when it was first built and/or settled, but it's seriously worn out by time and due to lack of renovations
If the house is 70-100 years old, it doesn't look interesting or homey - it's just very old and tiny, and often doesn't have conveniences
If you weren't poor, you'd build another wing to your house with an inside toilet and shower, but it would cost more than your tiny walnut shell of a house
Poor Soviet apartments are roomier and have all the conveniences, but they often lack maintenance
Many of these apartment blocks were built as temporary housing, and people still live in them
Building contraction and decay isn't exclusive to poor people's apartments, but when you have money, you can afford the maintenance
Poor people only do the bare minimum: fix wallpapers that peel off, fight fungus, paint over yellow stains, and place buckets if there's a leak
What fascinates me (morbidly) is that poor people slowly devolve "to their roots", i.e., don't have excesses and don't look too far into the future; don't read, don't strive, don't think of politics or the country as a whole - only of their household and what they're going to eat during the month/week/day, depending on the acuteness of their poverty
People work on land, preserve own produce for the winter, make their own stuff, fix clothes until they fall apart, sell what they grow, and become pretty autonomous from the state
Unlike downshifting, these are not fun and ecological activities - they're genetic survival mechanisms
A spider makes a web, and a poor Ukrainian makes a 3L jar of pickled woolen socks because the commies might come to take all the grain or the 90s might come to take all the non-material savings
Such a way of life makes gender roles valid again
Men have their traditional male chores back; they perform the regularly needed hard manual labor while women cook, clean, and care for children
Men work outside the house and women are in the house, and everyone is exhausted equally
Every one is dependant on others
Families live together in clans which isn't perfect for mental health and personal boundaries
Personal development is absent; people rarely travel within the country (usually to visit relatives) and never travel abroad
Alcoholism isn't a symptom of poverty, it's its companion, because drinking alleviates stress, postpones worries, gives relaxation to both physical body and mind (untreated mental issues)
The poster girls for Ukrainian poverty usually are elderly women in kerchiefs, near a decaying hut, selling homegrown food on asphalt, or begging on the corner (relevant [google picture search]
* [Example 1]
* [Example 2]
* [Example 3]
* [Example 4]
* [Example 5]
IMO, this is what I call "back to the roots". Poor people in Ukraine mentally live in one month/week/day, they're able to survive on their own without the state as long as they're physically capable
When a person becomes as weak and fragile as an elderly woman/man, and there's no family to support them, they live on margin and become social outcasts just like homeless Americans
Similarly to the US, the real image of Ukrainian poverty is the income difference between these outcasts unsupported by the state and the extreme wealth of the Ukrainian politics that take what legally belongs to common people in infrastructure, social welfare, and public healthcare
No, i am not a native English speaker, so i shouldn't have perfect English pronunciation without an accent
I do my best to speak without, but if i can't i wouldn't feel ashamed for this
Same for those who try to speak in my language, there is no reasons to feel ashamed
Not when I have to speak English after a long time of not doing so
Over time, I adjust and sound a little less "slavic" to my own ear
However, some native speakers told me that my accent is not that bad
Maybe they were just being nice
No, I sound like caricature Russian from a bad movie
Because iPhones are overpriced
Even a 2 years old model can easily cost 500$ or more here in Ukraine

Whenever I think of Bucharest badly, usually I think of Ferentari, but maybe all of Sector 5 sucks
"Got stuck in traffic". When our public transport is in traffic, several cars from the same rout might get bunched together within 1-2 km leaving the whole route waiting longer
Unfortunately, we don't have separate lines for public transport
People can't get on their bus/mashrutka even when their section of the road is clear, so it's a plausible excuse
"I was just standing there, waiting for 30 mins until I desided to hop on another route which naturally took me longer".
On the other hand, people usually know their regular commute, and being stuck in traffic all the time is still judged as inability to alter your commute/get on it earlier to compensate the delay, etc
Either IT guy or janitor
Maybe both
IT janitor lmao
Yes, but my English is not that good to consider it as a particular problem
Not because of this, I just choose whatever variant of word I like more
Actually I was taught American English but I prefer to use British English
At school they wouldn't expect an answer if I used British English, one time in an English exam I wrote
"Colour" and I got some points taken because the teacher said so
That I mix American and British English
Well, for some purist such a mix may look weird
The only thing which was shocking to me is that among the homeless people there were many people who did not look like typical bums
There were people who looked totally normal (as fas as you can judge) and able to work but still they lived on the streets and begged

"Soros conspiracy" is going strong here after recent elections in 2019
Yep, we have Soros conspiracy now, too
Basically new government started a few market reforms which will open the country to international investors (market for agricultural lands, new labor codex, privatization of state property)
Now all of the oligarchs united in one front against such reforms (because economic protectionism and restrictions is the way they became oligarchs)
And what happens when your Eastern European country is opening its economy to internationals
Good old Soros conspiracy is the way to scare the people
No way you'll give up your monopoly
Oligarchs are in control of the majority of TV channels, so it's not that hard to spread these Soros conspiracies, and the majority of Ukrainians are against market reforms, which is really sad
That there are a lot of Soros agents in government including prime minister, some others ministers and members of ruling party (some inner feud inside party, i don't know)
Also all this " conspiracy " comes from members of ruling party
In Ukrainian [the] order of [the] words can be changed in almost any way

I even not know what here to write
Dearly ask you to world of Ukrainian grammar
Without cases or genders, she yet still looks enough looking like English
You [are] right

It was written in pretty natural order
But I could write it in this way:
\[The\] order of \[the\] words In Ukrainian can be changed almost in any way
\[The\] order of \[the\] words can be changed almost in any way in Ukrainian
Almost in any way can be changed \[the\] order of \[the\] words In Ukrainian
&#x200B;
\[The\] last sounds less natural than \[the\] others, but still is correct

The quality of water depends from city to city
But as far as I know, most people in cities either buy water or refill it on some kind of public spring (especially in the region of the Carpathian mountains)
Some people also install personal filters for tap water
I personally buy water in a grocery store in my building which costs me ₴1 per liter (€0
03, $0
036)
Elderly people usually boil the water or don't care at all
However, after a few liters, you're gonna get a limescale deposit in your electric kettle and will start making a lot of whistling noise
It happens between any languages that you use fairly regularly, and the wolf you feed more grows fatter
When I use English for specific purposes, for example, arguing about the human rights of seashore gulls on the Internet but ignore the topic completely in real life, the needed vocabulary in Ukrainian or Russian escapes my mind completely
Not in Ukrainian or Russian, sorry, but I do care in English
Don't say that Ukraine is part of Russia
Don't call us russians when you hear our language or see Cyrillic
Russian or soviet symbolic, especially ribbon of sait george
UKish also not OKish I assume
what is the most correct way to call people of British Isles
Oh, haha, yep, we have it too
We easily understand Russian, because all Ukrainians can speak Russian, but we hate, when people call us Russians
My friends from Russia say that they don't understand Ukrainian, it's looks similar only visual
Nah, we prefer to turn it straight into a passive-aggressive verbal " skirmish ",sadly, but most of the surrounding countries still live by the past and with one we still enemies, like it was in the past
Maybe because Russia keeps doing the same shit that was many years ago over and over again
I've never heard them making an attempt at Ukrainian
Arrow speaking "perfect Russian" to Russian mobs sounded more like Arrow having a stroke
In Avengers, the [interrogating guy] speaks decent Russian, good flow, zero mistakes
Apparently, a second-third generation immigrant from a Slavic-speaking country
But his accent is some mix of American English and

Some people from Galicia and Zakarpattia speak super fast and have a thick Western accent, I actually sometimes think they're speaking Polish and not Ukrainian
In Ukraine people usually say «you will clean the courtyards of the city»
That the Chernobyl made most of territory unsafe to live
That we're not drinking vodka every day
Actually I even never tried it and I know many Ukrainians who don't drink alcohol at all
And in general we're not even in top 50 drunkest countries, even Sweden, Iceland and New Zealand drinks more than Ukraine
So yeah, I'm just tired of this stereotype

Donetsk for sure, looking ugly as shit
Even if you ignore damages from artillery in some districts, it really became so ugly you feel like you got back into USSR
Last time I was there in 2017, I think, and family says it didn’t get better
Not saying it was a beautiful city pre war, but it got some vibes over there and during Euro 2012 everyone seems to like it
For Ukraine, unfortunately, everything east of Dnipro
I can't really think of one city on the left bank that isn't known for being ugly
Well, it’s possible, but so complicated and I wouldn’t recommend doing this at all
You can enter the area by crossing the border from Russia - but it will be considered illegal by Ukrainian authorities and you might get a ban to enter Ukraine for a while
Alternatively, you can cross border from Ukraine to Donetsk region - but you need to obtain a special permit by registering on a website, and believe me, as a foreigner, you will need a really valid reason to allow you to enter Donetsk
This how it would work in a usual world
But now, at this moment, due to COVID - it’s nearly impossible even for fellow Ukrainian to visit Donetsk
I don't know, I've never been to the US, but from people's accounts, it's noticeable there
Maybe because when you hit rock bottom, it's difficult to recover, especially when you're an addict or have a mental illness that has caused this whole situation
Our weird people are mostly mentally ill
When they cause disturbance or can't be trusted with themselves, they're detained/hospitalized
Elderly people with symptoms related to their age may act weird in public, e.g. they talk to themselves, collect useless trash (hoarding), act agitated
What we don't have is street preachers or loud conspiracy theorists with cardboard signs
Nope, those are, probably, the result of US Americans being encouraged to voice their opinions on any issue, even when those opinions are baseless
Social shaming
Maybe I phrased it poorly
I meant psychotic disorders, i.e. when people lose touch with reality
When they commit an offense and there's a basis to get them detained, they are placed in a governmental psychiatric facility for further examination and treatment
An absurd example would be the father of my acquaintance who used to drink heavily and posed a threat to his relatives
They called the police and ER and asked them to detain him
But as long as he didn't commit any crime and didn't hurt anyone (except for a couple of bruises and stolen possessions), they didn't have a legal basis to proclaim him incapacitated and treat him as such
He himself would just say "no" to hospitalization and both the police and medics would leave
Maybe someone other familiar with our laws will correct me or tell you more

What everyone agrees on is that kids aren’t able to go to school
Funding for civil services such as school have all but ceased, and no one wants to be killed, let alone by neighbors or people who claim to have their interests at heart
A generation of people, who haven’t died, is being lost because life can’t normalise
And just talking about this subject invites strong partisan opinions
The whole anti-soviet movement
A lot people think that Ukraine decided to join Soviet Union by its own, but that's wrong
Most people were against soviet policy, there were a lot of riots and liberation movements in 20's, UPA in ww2, dissidents in 60s, couple of riots in GULAG and much more
Wait are they related to the Vaterlandisch front (sorry for butchering German)
Ukrainian doesn't have the full dual form, but there are some words that are remnants of it
For example the word for moustache - вуса (voosa)
For a person who has a word прст in your language, you treat too hard on vowelless words
I'd say it was historically a dual form, which survived in strange rule of how to use nouns with numerals
Edit: it seems, it's being unrelated to the dual form
Not in EU, but I think DST is dumb
Next day after clock changes there's spike in suicides, and DST also creates unnecessary confusion

Nope, I don't eat salo and borscht every day
What else cliches people have about Ukrainians
Not from Ukraine, but I remember Russian channel ran a story about how ancient Ukrainians dug up the Black Sea so they could wash themselves
Maybe the craziest theory I've heard is that Golden Horde has never existed and Mongols didn't invade Rus
People, who belive in this theory say that all the thousands people who died during The Mongol invasion were killed by forced christianisation
The Golden Horde is a myth that was made by rulers of Rus' to hide the evidences of their acts
I saw some book from Ukrainian "historian", unfortunately I don't remember his name
In it he describes that Ukrainians have lived on the Earth for thousands of years and took part in almost all main events in history
For some reason, I'm not surprised
Yeah, seen those
But I mean every country has those nutjobs
Sometimes
We joke about Kuban being "historically Ukrainian territory" and it should be taken by "peaceful referendum" just like our eastern neighbor did to Crimea
If anyone is hoping that Belarus will peacefully transform into a democracy as a result - it won't.
First of all, Lukashenka ain't giving power up peacefully
He will resort to anything in order to keep it, thinking replacing him without violence is possible is nothing more than wishful thinking
I mean, Minsk is already stacked with  troops
Second of all, every opposition candidate there is as much pro- Russian as Lukashenka is
And bring pro- Russian and democratic simply doesn't mix together
You have to remember, true pro-democracy opposition in Belarus has been locked up for years at this point
To be honest, whatever the result it doesn't look like much will change
Belarus will continue to be a Russian puppet
Maybe a little bit less authoritarian, but that's probably about it
> I can’t believe how detached Lukashenko is form the public
What's so unbelievable in that
It's not even 5 out of 10 on my delusional-dictator-meter
When your political party loses the legitimate election it's not the loss for democracy
It's the loss for your party
You summed up my thoughts perfectly
Couldn't say better
He is making deals with Russia, which is much more important for his security than dealing with the opposition
And the man has been a dictator for the last 30 years soon, he most likely truly thinks this is something he can easily solve and everyone will eventually shut up like always
Dictators are usually not the most reasonable people
> To be honest, whatever the result it doesn't look like much will change
Belarus will continue to be a Russian puppet
This is the point I made about what is likely to happen in Belarus and that is exactly what happened in Armenia
Did it become less authoritarian
Yes, it did
But that's about it
Even currently, it has no chance of becoming a truly western-style democracy
Armenia's case is a bit different though, with the difference mainly coming from the fact that it's sandwiched between two states that won't hesitate to destroy it and is in need of constant protection
So yeah, Armenia is a place where Russian interests are always gonna be safe, no matter the government
>Kyrgyzstan is also pretty democratic at the moment while also being in the Russian sphere
Kyrgystan is also the least inside of Russian sphere in a whole region (except, maybe, for Turkmenistan, but that's a completely seperate conversation)
And the thing is - unforunately, Kyrgystan has very little geopolitical significance so it's not like allies are lining up
Moscow gives a lot of shit about political structure in the country because controlling a single dictator or at least a very select few individuals who are in charge of the state is miles easier than controlling a democratic process
It's just cheaper and way safer
You have terrible tack records with those - a dozen of revolutions and only two won, and one of them won so badly people cried out for a new dictator just to get rid of the revolutionaries
True, but still there are many countries with a win/lose ratio way above French and with their successful revolutions not descending into the reign of terror
You don't get points for trying and failing a lot of times
Car service
So, in recent years many people in Ukraine started importing used cars from the US and discovered that many of those cars (not only cheap, even premium brands like Lexus) lacked service like oil change (it seems like instead of every 9000-12000km the oil is changed with the engine), brake servece, transmission oil, etc
We used to straight-up watch Russian channels, and they weren't really foreign
In the USSR, there was the central TV broadcasted from Moscow
After the dissolution, those few Russian governmental channels remained alive and kicking, showing mostly the same classic Soviet movies, entertainment tv shows, and the news were about the whole ex-Soviet space, but from the Russian POV
Ukrainian newspapers were printing TV schedules including Russian channels as well (the aforementioned governmental channels + new commercial chanels)
Sometimes Ukrainians wanted to watch something from a TV annonce, but were too late because Moscow and Kyiv had 1 hour difference in time, and the viewers didn't even account for that since the channels weren't perceived as foreign
We also had many shared celebrities (modern and Soviet), so we had shared cultural news as well
(Ukraine borders Belarus, but its TV has never been broadcasted here)
I wouldn't say it just stopped in 2014 - it had been slowly diminishing through the 2000s. Now we have equal amounts of news about Russia, Belarus, Poland (which is significantly less for Russia)
Obviously, Russian political and economic news draw a lot of attention since these aspects are currently important to Ukraine
But we don't get to know as much about Russian culture, movies, TV shows, what is popular there, about Russian celebrities or Ukrainian celebrities that moved to Russia for good
Finally, answering the main question of whether we feel overwhelmed by the news from Russia, I'd say we don't. We get as much Russian news as everyone; the difference is, we hear them in the language we actually speak, get all the references and minuscule details, and can interpret them in the context of those shared informational years
We also have specific channels that are like Fox news, so the pro-Russian people can switch to them and relax hearing the good old Russian POV
Neither president has had the balls to do something to them since these channels belong to oligarchs
Not much, at least since 2014
Most of the news is about our "inner kitchen", but sometimes some key news from Russia  also present
Life here is not so boring, that we must discuss news from our neighbors
Well, how the tables turned
I've never seen such deck
But it looks interesting

* A female name (not one word, but a concept)
* Mutant - because Europe, and especially [the EU] looks like those monsters made of doll parts
Or it's the Amnesia monster if you imagine Portugal+Spain as the head and France as the gaping mouth
* Blue - because it's the most traditional colour associated with Europe
But of course, as many people have stated, Europe is first and foremost the image of the map
In Russian it means to be brave
Usually it is said after something brave is done
Upd
Sometimes it could be said about people who have done something very hard
On the Parliament and local elections sometimes it was possible to vote for the people who I really respect, like volunteers or war heroes
But in case of party and president it's always lesser evil
Just because professional politicians are like that
I am not able to vote yet, but I belive in party and candidate that I support

"*[[this dish] is Russian*" or "[*[this dish] is Polish*"
If you want a Russian soup, try [щи/shchi]
Same with Ukrainians
Most people call any famous Ukrainian that was born in the Russian Empire Russian
This annoys us so much
Googling people before you meet them is creepy and just straight fucked up
Early Modern English snippet is more flowery than the Middle Enligh one
The latter is more succinct and easier to read, although, both are no problem to read and understand
To enjoy
The Old English text is a different story
I just don't understand it in both written and pronounced forms
1943 but Poland always overexaturates it
Norway: Eugenics and lobotomy, specifically targeting various "undesirables". Also the assimilation of the Sami
Ukraine: War crimes committed by members of SS-division Halychyna and UPA
Volhyn massacre
(Not saying that the Polish didn't do fucked up things to Ukrainians before this)
We do similar thing on [Ivana Kupala] We need to jump over a fireplace 3 times with our loved ones
I don't drink and don't like salo
What's up with your neighborhood
I thought it is Soviet thing
Why is it so popular in Romania
Drinking coffee in sauna
For those who don't know, it's a bad idea
Don't do it
"Russian salad" is used only abroad
Here it is called as "Olivje" or just as "Meat salad".
Yes, as u/hesapmakinesi told, caffeine may for short periods of time increase your blood pressure which is already high because of sauna
Probably nothing to worry about for young healthy person
I'm not sure in which temperatures do you use sauna, but I like to use banya that is very hot and to get massage with bath brooms to the point that I'm dizzy and at this point I suppose it can be really dangerous to drink caffeine contained beverages
Jesus Christ this picture is so unbelievably Eastern European
Do Finns pour water on stones in sauna
Sun - Сонце neutral
Moon - Місяць - male
Сонце (Sontse) - neutral
Місяць (Misyats) - male
Земля (Zemlya) - female
**Earth** --> *"Земля/Zemlia"* feminine, often depicted as a woman, a mother
**The sun** --> *"сонце/sontse"* neuter, depicted as a freckled child's face
There were four male Slavic pagan gods, one for each season
However, depicting the sun as a male person isn't common in popular culture
All I can see through googling is some modern pagan fanart
Pagan idols looked more [like this]
**The moon** --> *"місяць/misiats'"* masculine
One of the most common images for the moon is a sickle
Informally and poetically we call a crescent "a moon sickle" or "a young sickle" if it's a growing crescent
Sometimes a crescent is compared to [a cow with horns]
we have it as well, it is awesome

I remember something similar called Lolek and Bolek
Is this a different cartoon with two bald children
Well, historically - probably Catherine the Great, also Stalin or anyone connected to communism, although he’s adored by boomers
You see, there are many Ukrainians who support him and his actions (the same ones who praise Stalin and the whole USSR thing), but generally, we do
I don’t know how, but grief for the victims of this genocide manages to mix in people’s heads with idolatry of soviet regime and this really sucks
Ukrainian - very hard in both grammar and phonetics for non-Slavic people
But, even some other Slavs (i.e. Russians, Belarusians
) find г hard to pronounce
The grammar is kinda confusing for many people because of the amount of suffixes and prefixes
Gaining accent might be hard, although I'm not sure
I haven't seen many people that learn Ukrainian
I don't mean it's impossible to learn Ukrainian, you just need a lot of work and time
To Lithuania and other countries who help us during our rough times
I wanna thank all countries that have been supporting Ukraine since 2014
Especially Poland, Lithuania, Georgia and Canada
And special thanks to USA for all those javelins
Thank you for acknowledging it wasn't just Russia
I can understand many words in Polish
It is similar to Ukrainian,but there are a lot of silent sounds, like sz or nose vowels ę. When I studied Polish it was much easier to learn for me then foreigners I  with whom learned it,but it also was a challenge for me,especially writing
Overall, I can get what they are talking about
>silent sounds, like sz
They're called [digraphs] - two letters, one sound/phoneme
Just a remark
Oh thank you
I just had no idea what is the name for it in English !
Odesa, Ukraine
For some reason, it gained quite a bit of poplarity recently, and it's really not worth it
The beached inside the city are awful, the city itself very run-down and the prices are on European level
Basically, European level prices for very not European level service
The only reason to visit in my opinion is if you really wanna party
Lviv definetly worth a visit, especially if you are into good food/good alcohol type of tourism
Don't get me wrong, Lviv has a ton in terms of architecture and stuff, but the reason I go there every year is definetly for the restaurants (there are a bunch of themed restaurants of all kinds which I personally adore)
Kyiv in my opinion is a bit more boring, but of course it got a ton too see and do
If you are into nature, mountains and castles - Carpathians is a way to go
Places like Mukachevo, Yaremcha or Uzhhorod
If you are into beaches - I had good recommendations about Chornomorsk, but honestly, other countries definetly have better beaches
I live in Lviv
It worth a visit, but the whole city is overcrowded
If you want to have a better experience, I don't recommend you to visit it on Friday / weekends or search for quiet streets and secret places
Cafes, food, and drinks are nice, especially for tourists, because everything's cheap
If you will have spare time and you're into quiet towns with nice architecture and almost empty streets, visit Ivano-Frankivsk (130 km from Lviv)
Though it doesn't have as many entertainments as Lviv, it's a nice place with a charming atmosphere (at least the last time I was there)
For hiking - go to the Carpathian mountains
These are my favorite spots: Nesamovyte lake, Shpyzi, Homiak mountain, and Goverla (but I recommend the path from Nesamovyte lake)
I've honestly never head anyone complaining about Polish tourists ever
I mean, people like to talk shit, you know
Most of us perfectly understand that especially an older Polish generation will definetly talk shit about Ukraine from time to time, but that's alright, it happens
I mean, we're at war with Russia, so there's that
Why, I thought we were closest brothers
Our languages are so similar we understand each other when it's spoken and we don't have any quarrels
You mean occupation of Eastern Poland in 1939 by polish-soviet
Then it's until 1939, I'd say
Can relate to party+beach destinations
Just any place attractive mostly for nightlife, alcohol drinking/drug consumption and white people with dreadlocks, so music festivals as well
Also, the more traditional for the former USSR countries beach+sea destinations in Turkey, Egypt, etc
, where the staff speaks better Russian than English
Just as I replied to another comment here
tlen - oxygen in Polish and decay, ruin in Russian
ołów is lead (Polish), olovo is tin (Russian)
zapomnieć - forget (Polish), zapomnit' - remember (Russian)
and some Russian vs Ukrainian
нежить - running nose (ukr), undead (rus)
бабка - dragonfly (ukr) vs old woman (folksy rus)
maybe OP speaks a dialect where they don’t have the s - ß distinction
That second usage is great, I need to steal that haha
In general yes, despite all, i like my country
Still, i want to move and live somewhere else for some period of time (like a year or two) and then move back
I'd like to exchange my Lada for a Ford Granada
Love the idea, I think Frankie Goes to Hollywood already explored this in “Two Tribes” and their answer was that no one wins
But I say Russia
Putin is a martial artist, but if his ice hockey “performance” is indicative of his martial arts skill, Russia might have problems
Either way, Russia gets disqualified after winning
Drinking to become a little drunk and have a good time or relax is considered OK - this is why people drink

Same thing with winters
Last normal winter with decent amount of snow and normal temperatures (-15 to -5) was in 2015/2016 or in 2016/2017 in my region
Since then, winters are just extended autumns
Also, last two years' winters were not only snowless, but also dry, so plants had rough years afterwards
You need to be a total clown to deny climate change after this
Even worse with summers
Every summer there's a new heat wave, worse than the last one
and that's for good
minor traffic accident in lada and you're handicapped
some shops sell deepfried sea fish skin as a snack
not particularly tasty I must admit
but skin of fried river fish is delicious
Export Ladas are better than ones that were made for domestic (Russia + post-Soviet countries) market
It's actually huge sometimes
Export Ladas had light alloy wheels, air conditioning (rarely), roof hatches, better color options, there was even a Lada 2108 convertible
Most of these things were either added by local dealers or by local assemblers, if cars were exported as kits to some country
The latter was the case with Finland
Pretty much all Slavic languages
We're lucky to be on the intersection of western and eastern Slavic languages (even though officially Ukrainian counts as eastern Slavic language) to have good grasp of the roots of both
Those that use Latin alphabet may be tricky because of weird letters and combination of letters they use to write sounds that alphabet was never designed for

Probably salo
I don't think we will ever stop eating it
Our food is not even remotely about "fast" but the thing that comes to mind when thinking about a snack in Kiev would probably be [Kyivska Perepichka] (a kind of a sausage roll)
I've heard that when the USSR leaders died all TV channels stopped their usual repertoire and broadcasted something neutral like Swan Lake (btw, also duck-like birds-themed)
It since has become a joke
For example, some time ago Putin was absent from public view for a while despite some events that required his reaction
I don't remember what or when it was, but there was a wave of jokes that people couldn't wait to watch Swan Lake
Maybe it wasn't a thing in Hungary because it wasn't one of the republics of the SU
>It was supposed to be 'We're profoundly shaken by the death of Stalin
' but because of the typo it's basically 'We're deeply ordered to announce Stalin's death
Looks like they started the Khrushchev Thaw right away
But seriously, so weird were the times that I can't imagine how some people still can feel nostalgic about it
For one, my country is being torn by war and conflict at the moment
I think after so long you just get used to it and in time forget what the initial reason for the war was
As for countries beating the shit out of each other in the world wars, I don't find them getting along unnatural
After two wars of that scale, Europe just doesn't want a sequel to that
It's like post-civil war US
You have your regrets, you have your grudges but you don't want to continue the conflict
Plus, most of the reasons for the wars in Europe are gone by this point as there's democracy everywhere, most of the Germans (and Austrians) got deported out of their former lands in central Europe and generally most of the countries are content with their situation
That isn't true for Balkans(excluding Greece) and Eastern Europe though due to the main problems still being a thing
There's a fuckton of Serbs in most ex-Yugoslavian countries, a fuckton of Russians in post-soviet states and Russia isn't content with it's place in the world
Overall, I reckon, if the Russians calm down with their imperialism a bit and the Serbs (and perhaps Hungarians) don't try restoring their respectful empires, the peace in Europe will be a very long-lasting phenomenon
Mainly from you being in a similar position to Russia and Russia attempting to do that at the moment
I know that it may be an exaggeration but you never know
What I think is "it wouldn't be strange if in the near future Serbia claims lands of Bosnia or Croatia" rather than "Alarm
Serbia is going to war and the powderkeg is exploding once again
Not really
Just seeing how you guys beat the shit out of literally everybody in your region back in the day makes me doubtful
For one, we didn't expect Russia to act the way it did with it's minority over here so it wouldn't be strange for us if you did the same to Bosnia or Croatia
Also we have that stereotypical image of a Serb here that hates each and every of his neighbours (especially Croats), is super nationalistic and thinks of Russia as a great friend of their nation
So yeah, your image isn't that good over here
Tbh it's more "friend of my enemy is my enemy" thing
As you may know, we generally don't like Russia
This has objective reasons and isn't going to change radically unless something big happens
And looking back historically we can't help but see you guys as something similar to Russia
The same big Empire that collapsed, the same broad federation of many nations that privileged heavily the main one, the same superiority complex etc
While some of the key similarities between you guys are nonexistent by this point, we still can't unsee you as the Russia of the Balkans
I guess you know way more about the Serbs, living that much closer to them so I wouldn't argue with your position
As for our media, that's where you're a bit off
As of now, our media are in a kind of hybrid war with Russia
That is, pro-ukrainian forces call Russia and anybody affiliated with it aggressors, threats to world peace and enemies (and from our position, they aren't that wrong), while pro-russian forces call our modern government traitors/junta, advocate for close ties with Russia(i.e becoming a Russian puppet like Belarus) and privileges for Russian language, while being financed directly by Russian government
So our media aren't exactly impartial at the moment and that probably won't change in the nearest future
What I think of Serbs is based by what they did historically
That is because overall most people (excluding pro-russian folks, I haven't the slightest idea what that retards are thinking of right now) here abridge and simplify Yugoslavia to the following
•Yugoslavia is Soviet Union but smaller, Serbian and southerner
•Serbs oppress Croats and Bosniaks
•Big bad Serbian dictator died and Yugoslavia started to crumble
•Yugoslavia collapses, everybody fights everybody
•Serbs bad, Croats good
As you see, people over here(me included) aren't really that knowledgeable on the topic
I'm sorry if I offended any Serbs though, that wasn't my intention

Folk music
It was considered boring and outdated by many when I was a kid
Only old people were enjoying folk performances in parks and on TV
Although, many kids were attending folk dance classes and bandura/accordion classes
Anyway, as an adult, I really enjoy how many Ukrainian electronic folk bands there are
Also, white singing isn't everybody's cup of tea, but I like it
In the 90's folk music was a couple greybeards and auntie types singing cringy old stuff on public access TV
Now it is being reinvented in a multitude of styles, is definitely a hip thing to do, as other aspects of the cultural revival that slowly started with the 2004 revolution and really took off after 2014, with some of the performers going international, something absolutely unimaginable back in the 90's. So to answer your question, yes, definitely
There always have been folk artists of all ages: kids, teens, young adults and adults, older people, elderly
It's just that now the listeners are getting younger and the musicians often add some twist to folk, mix it with other genres or rework other genres using folk instruments
If you haven't, also try [Bulgarian folk] I mean, if you enjoy folk music
This year, we were to send **Go_a** with a song called "Solovey". They aren't new to the folk electronic scene
They've been in it for 8 or so years
Some of their songs that I like:
[Go_A - Веснянка]
[Go_A - Жальменіна]
[Go_a - Рано-раненько]
* **KHAYAT** - a young folk electronic artist who also was on Vidbir to Eurovision:
[KHAYAT - От і вся лбв]
[KHAYAT - OSOKA]
* **The Doox**
[The Doox - Гриць \(Hryts'\)]
[The Doox - Колискова \(Live\)]
* My personal favourites, **YUKO**. They take authentic folk lyrics and mix with own original music
[YUKO - Hreblia]
[YUKO - Водубьору]
[YUKO - YARYNO]
[YUKO - Buvaite Zdorovi]
* **Alina Pash**
[Alina Pash - BOSORKANYA]
Woo contemporary Ukrainian music shameless plug
In no particular order, not all to my liking, only popular stuff (I know there is avantgarde/indie scene but I have no idea what's going on there):
[Boombox - Your Number/Ivy] (2nd part is using lyrics from a 19 century Ukrainian poet, probably the most known Ukrainian woman)
[Alone in a canoe - I Have No Home] (context: in post-invasion Ukraine a lot of people from the Eastern part of the country had to become internal refugees)
[Dakha Brakha - The Monk]
[Hristina Solovy - Fortepiano]
[Onuka - Vidlik] - Her band's name is literally "Granddaughter" since she's a granddaughter of a locally famous traditional instruments maker
To illustrate production improvements, here's our pop diva Tina Karol in 2011:
And in 2019:
There's something simple and primal yet meaningful about the genre
I like folk from many countries/cultures
I think the sound of bandura holds a special place in Ukrainian folk
[Traditional bandura]
[Modern]
[Contemporary music on bandura]
It's not European, rather international, but I **love** Burger King

In Ukraine, we either say *"electronic post"* or use the hostname of one of the most popular e-mail services, e.g. Gmail, Ukrnet, (used to be) Yandex, etc
E.g., *"send it to me on Ukrnet/Gmail"* means *"send it to me via e-mail"*. But when I propose to send it via e-mail to you, I use the word "post".
Unrelated, but colloquially people often say *"throw it"* instead of *"send it via electronic means of communication"*.
In Russian, there's also a slightly outdated slang term *"мыло/mylo"* (literally means "soap")
So the phrase *"throw it on my soap"* is universally and unambiguously recognized as *"sent it to my e-mail"*.
Russia
Poland
Austria
Ottomans
I'm not sure about the fifth, really depends on the era we are talking about
Lithuania suddenly appears in 14 hundreds and after the Union of Lublin we never hear about it
Coud be greeks too, leart about their colonies in the northern Black sea and about Byzantium
Poland and Russia (and later the USSR)
Then Lithuania, then Turkey, then Hungary (Austria–Hungary)
Weirdly, but not so much about Belarus
No brother countries here
We've been counting this word/concept as a slur for a while since every country that had claimed to be Ukraine's brother ended up being Russia
We ironically call Russians "dear brothers" (*bratushki*) or "mouse brothers" (*myshe-bratiya*) which is similar in sound with the phrase "but we're brothers" (*my zhe bratiya)* that they like to repeat while twisting their knife in our territorial integrity
We have other countries that have never claimed this "brotherhood" with us but acted as allies, which is a much healthier relationship
Mentality wise, every country that has never led an expansive war has something similar to Ukraine, so we can understand each other better than with former empires and owners of colonies
Poland
Alot of people immigrate there or go to work/study to Poland
Poland
We had some problems in the past, but now we are BFF
Croatia is our Balkan brother
I don't know why but we love each other
Maybe because of pretty similar history
Georgia is our Caucasian brother
Mainly due to the fact that they also suffered from Russian agression
Canada is our brothers, too
There is a huge community of Ukrainians
And they were first country (with Poland) to recognize our independence
Poland is an ally at the moment in addition to being a "career destination". The relationship is indeed weird
Despite the regular reports about the mistreatment from Polish employers, the historical tensions/nationalistic clashes the general opinion on Poland is neutral at least and positive at best
The media never fixates on negativity, IMO
They will write songs about this unbreakable unity based on cheap liquor and cigarettes :)
Lithuania is a great ally :)
We like Belarusians on average, but understand their political situation and peculiarities of their mentality
Yet again, this "brother nation" thing has to give way to just good-natured coexistence
> Now im sad :(
> Me too now
Scandinavian vibes
Oh yeah, learning the language of a country where you live is definitely "ethnic cleansing"
They can learn it
It can be taught as foreign language in school program
Children have to study other subjects on Ukrainian after fifth grade
Northern Bukovina always had Ukrainian majority
So it wasn't "for no reason".

They have to know Ukrainian
>According to the Romanian census of 1930, the territory of the future Chernivtsi Oblast had 805,642 inhabitants in that year, out of which 47
6% were Ukrainians, and 28
2% were Romanians
47,6% is not "slightly more" then 28,2%
Dude, do you think I know what was on mind of that madman
I am not justifying him, just wanted to make a point that northern Bukovina had Ukrainian majority and Southern had Romanian

on a third day of celebration, few people visit people, that were celebrating previous three days, at home and "steal" chicken (ask politely, but everybody pretends it is a theft)
that evening (almost) all food is made of chicken (mostly in a form of a soup) and everybody eats shared food all of which came from the guests
[description in Ukrainian]
"Ukrainian language is russian polish"- that what i heard mostly from russians
"You guys sound like you are always fighting each other"
Yeah, it's rather derogatory
Ukrainian is Russian Polish, Belarusian is Russian Polish-Lithuanian
Polish is Russian Latin-German, Serban/Croatian are Balkan Russian
Bulgarian is Russian Churchian
Kazakh is Russian can-readian-but-can't-understanian
> Kazakh is Russian cant-readian-but-can't-understanian
They switching to Latin script, so it's become " Kazakh is Russian can't-readian-can't-understanian
Mussolini started off as a socialist before ww1
He was kicked out of the party for being pro war
Thank you, Lithuania, for the consistent support
Wanted to mention you, too, but it's more complicated, and I didn't want to end up throwing shade (this time)
With Lithuania, it feels like they want another equal by their side; Poland's attitude is more like "an enemy of an enemy" or "we're doing charity taking all those Ukrainians in, and they don't even want to completely agree on our take on OUN/UPA", etc
Let's say, thank you, Poland, for Donald Tusk, and for opposing Germany "doing business" with Russia yet again
Yes, this is how I like it
*a small voice in the back of my head*: ^don't ^^screw ^^^it ^^^^up, ^^^^^Ukraine
Well, I'm not perfect, maybe another Ukrainian will thank you better
so do something
As Ukrainian, I know that it's better to keep trying to do something than do nothing and afraid that "next government will be the same or worse".
Yes, I know it
You should keep doing even if there are no other people supporting you
And if you ARE doing something, then I can add nothing except "Best wishes and hold on"

**1)** We had regional elections on October 25
Certain regions have pro-Russian parties leading, but pro-Ukrainian parties also have a decent representation
The most notable news is that the so-called "servants" ("Servant of the People", Zelenskyi 's party) didn't get much
In the parliamentary elections of 2019 all a candidate had to do was to take a "servant" template in the [TM green colour] and place their face on it, and he or she was elected
Yesterday it was almost the opposite
**2)** Another topic is the weather
Today we have +14C which is more typical for late September-early October
The leaves are still mostly green, although the middle of October is supposed to be the traditional golden autumn with bright yellow maples and heaps of fallen foliage, and by early November, we might have had the very first snow
Nah, Slovakia is awesome outside of Old Town of Bratislava
Belarus is pretty interesting imo because it’s sort of a window into what a modern soviet union could look like
As far as I know the government didnt really change things that much after 1991 so all of the state-owned stores and buffets with foods my parents reminisce about are all still there, it’s kinda cool
Also, it has part of Biloveža forest which is pretty old, i’ve never been there though so I don’t know if it’s worth or not
Break a leg
One of the most corrupt countries in Europe to say the least
It is probably [Carol of the bells] it is an Ukrainian traditional song that became popular in the US
In Ukrainian it is called Щедрик
Our spiritual anthem [Молитва за Україну (Prayer for Ukraine)]
They are,but Щедрик is very well know song abroad that has its origin in Ukraine
I don’t know about every country,but I think, that in the US it’s quite popular
First I saw it in “Home Alone” when Kevin was in a church
So that was my first encounter with the American version
Kyiv
Pros:
* A lot of 24/7 services
* services are mostly on every step
* Decent subway
* Greenspaces
* Center of city mostly safe and clean
* Big fucking river in the middle of the city
What I don't like:
* car traffic is terrible
Shitty public transport (except subway)
bad roads
* lack of medium-density housing
* new blocks are ugly, overpriced and unpractical as fuck (like those blocks where can live 4200 people and only 100 parking lots
* Infrastructure constantly breaks
Commieblocks are mostly grey, dirty, and need capital repairs
* Advertising everywhere
* The city doesn't have to unite architecture style, so, for example, old houses in baroque style can  coexist with a house in style "Architectors nightmare "
* Pollution
* The criminal situation also not encouraging for optimism
Zakarpattia Oblast
Basically it is a region that is situated beyond the Carpathians
But we often joke that it is unexplored area and no man knows what inhabits that area
Well, we had only one monarch - [Daniel of Galicia] so we don't have much choice
EDIT: If we count Grand Princes  (and regent-consort, princess-consort and dozens of a princess )  we have next names:
For men : Oleg, Rurik,Askold,Dir, Sviatoslav **,** Vladimir , Sviatopolk , Iziaslav, Yuri and planty of others
For women:  Olga , Anna, Maria,  Ingegerd , Anastasia , Rogneda , Elisaveta   and planty of others
Some would say - should borsch be with smetana (type sour cream) or without
My family have always been cooking a borscht with haricot beans and a little meat
It had felt right but then I met many people who put so much meat in a borscht as they had killed all pigs on Ukraine
Moreover, somebody even treats that borsht with haricot beans like pineapple pizza
Horrible
Jokes aside, there are so many varieties and that's great
However, beans Vs meat is the main war in my area
In the west people tend to argue whether or not they can add lemons or other fruits to borsht to make it sweeter or soirer
I never tasted it
\~ five years ago I liked to eat borsch with a ton of pepper or sauce in it where smetana just not fit in
Now, I prefer simple borsch with smetana
In Ukrainian platypus is "duckbeak" - *"качкодзьоб/kachkodziob"*, which sounds like a more specific "ptakopysk". Like, which "ptakh"? A duck
Which type of "pysok"? A beak
Apparently, a loanword from Ukrainian :)
I suspect, it's [Kazka - Плакала \(Cry\)]
It's a song about tough women's fate of sitting at the kitchen and crying but then standing up and "blooming like a violet again".
There was a 90s singer Tatiana Bulanova singing about being a single mother and rocking her son to sleep while he's crying and calling for the dad - the same thing, but this time a Ukrainian singer
When *Kazka - Плакала* came out a couple of years ago, you didn't even have to own a device to listen to it - you could just open up your balcony, and there was some dude playing it loudly from another balcony
Or you could go outside and hear it playing from a kiosk
Or you could take a bus and hear it playing from the driver's cabin
Or you could go to a forest or riverside and hear it playing from where some people were having a picnic
Or you could go to a governmental institution and hear it playing as someone's ringtone
As a proper earworm, the song had covers, parodies, etc
It was later discovered that the lead singer was a [less than ideal] live performer (she had some kind of stage anxiety and couldn't control her voice since she was not professionally trained)
So many people were gleeing while cancelling her, because, apparently, people can't handle someone's success for too long
(*Kazka's [Apart] is a great song though*)
But if you want a decent Marc Dacascos-style comeback, here's [a more recent] live performance
I think it was Jamala or Tina Karol who helped her with the vocals
Dude, fuckin true
That one song by ONUKA that was in a Vodafone commercial also counts
I forgot the name
Do Bulgarians understand the lyrics or was it more like a catchy tune when the lyrics don't matter
You're right, especially the part with the guy playing the buhai
[ONUKA - Vidlik (Countdown)]
Surgery lamp, multi-stage rockets and vacuum welding
>There was no collaboration in Poland
But what about Schutzmannschaft Battalion 202 and The Holy Cross Mountains Brigade
I am not blaming or anything
Just really curious
Thanks for the info
What's the most well known videogame from your country
Tell a couple if you can
In Ukraine, it's definitely S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Fantastic series
Apart from S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:
Ubisoft Kyiv helps with development of Ubi games
Also, Plarium has a big office in Kharkiv, so Raid: Shadow Legends is partly Ukrainian
Metro 2033/Last Light/Exodus
Sherlock Holmes series
Cossacks
I used to watch my dad play them
Could not think of a game more fondly tbh
Baba is You is pretty cool
Arkane also has that cool ass return to ravenholm game
Ah yes the wholesome 100 CD Project Red
Ahhhhhhhhh put a sock in it
Idk man stalker was made by a Ukrainian studio
Trine's cool though, Control even more so
ebön :----DDDDDDDD
God, I miss Krautchan so much
I thank Poland , for helping us
Zhyvchik
^ Basically it is an apple lemonade
There are also other flavors like pear, lime, cherry, orange, but apple is the most popular
You can also buy zhyvchik without gas, but it will be just an ordinary apple juice
[Kvas] Kvas is a fermented drink made out of rye bread
There are a lot of different flavors of it in Ukraine(orange, mint and strawberry, blackberry), but they all suck ass imo
* **Kvas** - both as a [storebought carbonated drink] and more [traditional drink] made with bread
It's a less offensive relative of beer with a tiny bit of alcohol content from fermenting
It's also sweet and a little sour, with a hint of dried fruits
Basically, what all kids imagine when they see adults getting and drinking [cold, foamy] beer
* [**Живчик/Zhyvchyk**] - apple soda with 1 ml of apple juice to justify its mentioning in the ingredients
Tastes not as sweet and artificial as other apple sodas though
Actually, it tastes a lot like water-diluted carbonated apple juice
There's also [pear, lemon, and orange] Zhyvchyk which also consist of ~1 ml of juice
IMO, the lemon one is better than Sprite or 7UP, but in general, they're not too different from other similar sodas
* [**Узвар/uzvar**] - a drink made with boiled [dried fruit] - apple, pear, plum, raisins
* [**Кисіль/kysil**] - a drink made with water, potato starch, fresh or preserved fruit, berries, rhubarb, sweetbrier berries, etc
Definitely English
Metro games have Ukrainian as language option, but they're the only ones I know
Really
These are the most famous Ukrainian video games
Check out Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light and Metro:Exodus
What about us
We are your neighbours yet you didn’t even mention us, greetings from Transcarpathia, Ukraine
Used to love milk when I lived in the village, there was real milk from cows, not this "milk like drink" which is sold in our shops
Usual milk is too sweet for me, so I prefer vegan (wheat) one
Though I only add it to meat/salad/coffee, I'm not drinking it on it's own
у чорта на рогах / at devils horns , "at the ass of the world ".
Surprisingly we describe the middle of nowhere as city of Kryžopoľ cause it sounds like bent arse
«Раз-два-три-чотири-п‘ять, я йду [усіх вас] шукать». (One-two-three-four-five, I'm going to look for you all)
But we also used russian «Кто не спрятался, я не виноват». (Ready or not, here I come)
"Кто не спрятался, я не виноват!" (Who didn't hide, I am not guilty
It's direct translation can be missunderstood
It means "If somebody didn't hide, it's not my fault"
Ну вообще то да вы правильно перевели, просто в русском фраза звучит как два отдельных не связанных предложения. Мы такие вещи понимаем, а носители английского не знаю.
Lol we too
Sorry, if late but like What
I don't know who you talked to about Romania and Moldavia uniting and it's bothering us
Where did you hear it
I never heard about us hating you because of it
For me it's like first time
Well,it's okay lol with covid 19 right now don't forget about your health too:)
Funny reason though xD
Kite is "змій/zmiy" which is a serpent or a dragon
There's [Zmiy Gorynych] a fairytale creature which is essentially a dragon
Dragon is "дракон/drakon", a more common name
I was today years old when I realized it
When I was in the Blue Mosque I first saw an American lady tell her kids that taking of their shoes is unnecessary (she was standing under the sign that says it's necessary)
Later, in the main hall, I saw Chinese tourists knocking on columns to check if they are real and taking photos of praying people with flash on (BTW these praying people were women from some radical Islam movement)
Russian
Basically mostly every Ukrainian can understand, speak, and write in Russian freely
Russian
It is even more popular than the country's national language, Ukrainian
For many citizens Russian is first language
Yes, I moved for studies in 2014 to Poland and haven’t returned back since
However, I am planning to move to another western country once the opportunity arises
In Ukraine we have two names for railroad: "Kolija" which means train track and "Zaliznytsya", which means whole railroad infrastructure
Yes, every time you go mushrooming in an unknown area, you have a chance to go too deep into the forest where the GPS just shows green in every direction
In this case, you need to find some road (with a map or by listening) and head towards it to see some roadsigns, ask the bypassers in cars or even hitchhike
I've been in similar situations
Despite the part of the forest I was in was maintained (some sand roads, no wild suppling undergrowth under older trees, etc
), the forest was still vast and looked the same everywhere
We were trying to head towards the railroad, but in a forest like this, the sound travels weirdly
We ended up walking away from the railroad
One time we went to the forest, and I jokingly pointed out where the north is based on moss on the trees
Hours later we were trying to get back and were kinda walking in circles
Ended up checking the moss on trees and this is how we were able to walk straight
Yes, area around Chernobyl
Basically, when human activity ceased, animals returned
Bears, deer, wolves, all of them are now in plenty there
Shame 5% of forest was affected in recent fires
We also have wild boars coming to people's fields in the countryside
They're smart and know how to dig under fences to get those free snacks
Oh yes, our primary school classes called "nature-knowledge" (Nature science
) finally pay off
There's a clearly visible road SW of that point less than 1 mile away lol
Most people I know don't even read newspapers
Probably no one
We didn't have friends as we were always kinda oppressed by almost all of our neighbours :(
Yep, didn't have time to form a country as Poland and Russia always fucked us over, then Germans came
Although Austria and Hungary,they were the best out of all the oppressors
Edit: but now it's a time to make good friends
Well, we are friends(and a good ones :)) but certainly not the oldest form of friendship like was stated in the post
Well, we are good friends with them but I can't say that we are close to each other for example like Lithuania and Latvia I'd say
This kind of bond with our circumstances back n the days was difficult to make
Well, Belarus more like a family
Yes, I know that,so if what I wrote was too salty sorry then
Can you please list then some of things and occasions where we oppressed them
I know ukrainians have done some bad things to Poles but i don't think there was a time where we had much more power than Poland
It's okay, you didn't sound mean, more like rational :) I didn't see your flair when I was writing a response, so I can see why it was more or less perceived in a bad light
Nope, I am tired enough with the inner permanent political shitstorm and I don't want to dive into another one
Since our politics and life in the country heavily depends on (especially) Russia, Poland, USA and EU in general, I personally find it hard to be completely ignorant what's going in there
Indeed, that's a big problem in our country
80%-90% percent of kids start to smoke at 13 and drink at 14
That's illegal in my country, but shops rarely follow this law
Even some teachers at schools just ignoring smoking and drinking kids
Ukrainian made indie games, bought few games but never played in them since i don't have much time for videogames now
"Як скажеш"[Yak skazhesh], which means "As you say" or "As you wish"
People usually have one first name and one last name
People with a hyphenated first or last name aren't common, but they do exist
* The structure of an average person's name:
Name (e.g., Mariya) + Patronymic derived from the father's name ([daughter] of Petro --> Petrivna) + Last Name (Moroz)
= Mariya Petrivna Moroz or Moroz Mariya Petrivna
The last name comes first or last in order
Usually, if it's for practical purposes, we announce the last name first, and when it's used in natural speech, the first name comes first
In Ukraine we first write our family name, then our first name and a patronymic (father’s name plus suffix)
Many people also have their baptism name, but it it is not used officially
You're right, female patronymics usually end with **-ivna** (Petrivna) and male - with **-ovych** (Petrovych)
Grammatically patronymics are adjectives (I guess
) and must agree with the first name in gender, number, and case
E.g.,
Nominative: Mariya Petrivna, Danylo Petrovych
Genitive: Mariyi Petrivny, Danyla Petrovycha
Dative: Mariyi Petrivni, Danylovi Petrovychu
and so on
You're welcome
That Cnornobyl is next to Kyiv and he was worried to get radiation poisoning
“A bit” In British English would mean that
Don’t ask what hui means in Slavic languages
[This opera and balet theater in Kharkiv]
At least you have the fucking balls to say it
That's Polish actually
Thank Putin for that
It's not free, it's financed from taxes - it's long waiting times (not in an emergency case), doctors can treat you like shit (you will still come back to them), treatment quality can be low and more harmful than the disease, doctors get a lower wage
I think universal healthcare should function alongside private medicine and get proper financing, that's the perfect balance
Will, will Will will Will Will's will

omg, ikr
I've been learning English for 12 years in school and kindergarten, and still not sure what tenses in certain situations I should use
Whatever the fuck was happening in Yugoslavia during it's collapse
I've got no idea who the sides of the conflict were(apart from "Serbs dislike Croats and Bosniaks and it's mutual") and why where they fighting in the first place apart from partitioning Yugoslavia
It's been 2 years, and many Ukrainians still can't believe we've elected a pantless muppet to be the president
Are you heavily Orthdox
You love Easter
You're crazy for Easter
Are you anything else
You love the New Year
Christmas was banned in Soviet times
To substitute, people celebrated the New Year
It's still a big holiday to this day
AFAIK it's either Odessa or the area near Carpathians, like Lviv or Ivano-Frankivsk
If the state is commonly mentioned in pop culture, then most people are familiar with the name
If there's a specific city mentioned as well, people know the city
Sometimes those things aren't connected, like, people know Las Vegas, Chicago, or New Orleans but not the states those cities are in
Although, they know those are the US cities
That's the very basic knowledge
Other people might be familiar with more states and where they're on the map
Not precisely, more like, is it in the north or south, does it have a shore, and so on
You never know what exactly the person in front of you knows, have they been to the US themselves or if they have relatives there so they know stuff secondhand
But it's safe to assume people outside of the US know it better than the US Americans themselves know the outside world
Which one
Same for any language, mate
I mean, Polish wouldn't be so hard, if you were growing up speaking Russian and Ukrainian as your mother tongues
I would be because it would really benefit my country
Let us in
Same
Polish is already more popular in Ireland than Irish
That’s SAD
Yeah
However I think efforts are not enough
I mean Israel managed to resurrect hebrew
Why isn’t Ireland not as successful in brining Gaelic back
I hope basque language would be preserved
It’s the only one pre-indoeuropean language of Europe alive
Extra senses and REN tv just had the biggest bullshit
It's pretty good, but still not as big and detailed as the English one
So I use both - depending on the topic
No, it's not
I once drank too much tap water, because didn't have bottled with me, the next day I was in a hospital with appendicitis
No, I don't trust the quality of our pipes and water

> that should have shown us, that there will only be a future in peace, solidarity and unity among all European peoples
Yeah, right
Peace and unity
"It's cold put on a warmer jacket/hat and don't forget the gloves"
"Where's your warm hat
This hat isn't warm enough"
"You have lost weight, do you eat at all
"You'll see when you have your own child"
Funny to here about warm hat, because winters here is kinda warm
e.g. +9 today in Kyiv
same
hey
Yeah, but mom phrases mutate and adjust themselves in unusual situations
Now that it's so unusually warm, I need a warm hat anyway because *"you're so thin, do you eat at all
You don't have any fat to keep you warm"*.
Oh i remembered about when it’s cold but you wear light clothes mom always says: “It’s not may month outside”
Yes, I've heard this one, too
Also *"fair heat breaks no bones"* (unlike cold), which always sounded weird to me since fever gives body aches alright
Here, in Ukraine, parents of grandparents always keep saying this :)
I’m about an elevator
Yes, Ukrainian pronunciation is close to the spelling, as long as you can hear some minuscule nuances
E.g., "*чолові****ч****а/cholovi****ch****a*" (of a man; adjective; the f. gender) and "*піврі****чч****я/pivri****chchi****a*".
We can pronounce written Russian perfectly except for stress
Writing a word after hearing it is not a sure thing, but mostly you can do it too
My dad calls it "*where the king goes to without his entourage*".
Russian has *сральник* - sralnik
Ukrainian *сральник* - sralnyk
Срач means a mess in Russian
The word "Palyanytsya" (a type of  Ukrainian bread made from wheat flour ) - basically the easiest way ([Shibboleth] to identify Russian, because, despite the similarity between ukranian and russian words, russians would say somesthing like Palyanitsa
Ukrainians (as well as Belarusians and Russians) have been watching a lot of telenovelas since the 90s. Many people, even younger ones, might take interest in the lives of the actors from these series
Some titles are meme-like, but with respect to its cultural significance :
* Escrava Isaura (Isaura: Slave Girl)
* Los ricos también lloran (The rich also cry)
* Rosa salvaje (Wild Rose)
* Simplemente María (Simply María)
* Dynasty
* Dallas
* Santa Barbara
* Muñeca brava (Wild Angel)
* O Clone (The Clone)
* Muhteşem Yüzyıl (The Magnificent Century)
Some people believe that our blue-yellow flag should be yellow-blue instead
This conspiracy theory (let's call it so) has gained so much traction it even has a [WIKI page]
In fact, the flag was yellow-blue [at some point in history] but the order doesn't really matter, because blue and yellow are two state colours, not a scheme for wheat and sky or water and fire, or something like that
Many Ukrainians have Cossack nicknames as surnames
A bunch of dudes were living in steppes, in a self-governing free state, practicing martial arts, giving each other nicknames like "Break-the-oak" or "Speckled-butt", and then those nicknames have become surnames for their descendants
One day you're *u\/tasty_dino_meat* on Reddit, and a couple of centuries later you have a proud dynasty of Tastydinomeats next to surnames like Smith and Ericsson (in our case, Ivanchenko and Kovalchuk)
In Ukraine, there is an organization called "Plast". They are more close to American scouts, I think, but they also get brainwashed with religious bullsh*t.
[P.PAT, YUKO - Hrushka (Pear Tree)]
It's not bad, but I only gave it a second chance since it's one of my favourite bands
Can't really recommend it to the people I know since it has folk lyrics + whatever genre of music + obscenities = not everybody's cup of tea, but it sounds good to me
That it is insulting to get called Russian as a Ukrainian
I feel you brother
Especially with the conflict going on between Russia and my country, it’s insulting x10 when people go “ooh Ukraine and Russia
Same shit”
We can relate
Yup hahaha
Slav radar, sounds funny
Btw, i can distinguish Russian , Ukrainian and Belorussian easily
I can’t explain how, but this works so accurate
"Каак пагодка в Маааскве?"
It's usually a one-way thing
We and Belarusians can smell out Russians a mile away, they usually have a hard time telling even a Lithuanian apart
LMAO
You can hear russian strong voice
They are speaking too hard, seems like rude
Moscow
i didnt see any but i heard  **Kropyvnytskyi**  is the borignest place on the planet
At least it has a sea
There are a lot of towns similar to it in Eastern Ukraine without anything fun at all like Kramatorsk or Kamianske
Then better start with Kyiv or Lviv
Never been there but yes there are really cool places at/near Carpathians
Totally, it also has lots of cool bars and restaurants
It has it's charm
Also lots of country's best restaurants
Worth visiting
Everything
It is easier to name all that is more expensive
here, in Ukraine, i am paying 5€ per month
(unlimited internet + 500sms and 500 minutes on other operators and in some European countries
I like being a spectator of it
But being outside - no
We call flip-flops "vyetnamki" - Vietnamese
The word for Belarus in Norwegian is more correct than in English
I mean, the correct name literally means " White Rus' ", and English name is just a transcription

And also homo sapiens)
Not Ukrainian, but Polish with Ukrainian actors - "With Fire And Sword" (Ogniem i mieczem)
Absolutely love it
Watch "Servant of the people" . It isn't a movie, but a series made by our current president Zelensky, at the time when he wasn't our president, and it's about his character being our president
I don't suppose there are a lot of Ukrainians here, so here goes
Cyborgs
It's not a masterpiece per se, but it offers our perspective on the war we still have going, if that's interesting
Anyone who is patriotic, want to defend the country till the end and don't want to make compromises with the aggressor would do
Someone take Zelensky away, please
Yeah, pretty much
I didn't like him from the start, but most people loved him
Now his approval rating is only half the figures he got after the elections and citizens start to hate him
The exact same situation happens in Ukraine every time after elections
Someone wins elections, the next year he is the enemy of the people
It's wonder me we have some our words sounds similar in Dutch
For ex
Cukor = Цукор ( sounds like Tscukor, means sugar) in Dutch suiker; Дах ( sounds like Dach, means roof) in Dutch dak
Why
Many gypsies speaking in Hungarian
Sorry don't follow them
But met such in UA and in Sk, especially near the border
Salo in chocolate
Pig fat smeared in milk chocolate
Is it possible not to like cheese
We have similar thing
It's called Kholodets'.
Any amount of cheese before a date is too much cheese Charlie
We're talking about a different "cheese"))
Revolution, Independence, Bolshevik occupation and terrorism
We've got our independence, and Russians are even more salty now
We have a country now
Well Poland fucking betrayed us and made peace with the soviets making us lose independence and get absolutely fucked for 70 more years
Dude
If Bolshevik Ukraine was independently governed from Kyiv, I could agree
But it was governed by Russian Bolsheviks from Moscow
More to say, in 30's all pro-Ukrainian Bolsheviks were killed
Hitler was an Austrian
Why do we blame Germany for Nazi atrocities
The same as we don't blame Georgia for Stalin and Ukraine for Khrushchov
Fun fact: the strongest wave of Russianization in Ukraine came when Khrushchov got the power
Ukrainian history as a whole
Most people outside of Ukraine itself know almost nothing about our history, often conflating it with russian one
In Ukraine we have village called Яр, which translates as ravine
Only 4 people live there
I had read the Lord of the Rings long time ago in Russian and this name was tranlated like "Torbins". They just translated the meaning of the name and keep English-style surname
For me it is good
More foreign
Sad, but it can be rebuilded after all
Yeah, I'm bilingual, like everybody else, but have tried to speak both languages instead of having one dominant (Russian) and the other one sounding too artificial/formal since it was the language of my education (Ukrainian)
But my friends (also fully bilingual people) protested when I tried to speak Ukrainian to them because they were weirded out by the personality shift
Every predominantly Russian speaking Ukrainian has a lot of Ukrainian words, phrases and jokes in Ukrainian inserted in their speech
I see it as neon yellow verbal highlighter used to make some parts of the speech more expressive
Same happens with Russian phrases in Ukrainian, but to a lesser extent, and people have no problem with that
But the full-on switch from one code to another is, apparently, too much
Something similar happened to my coworker who used to hear me speaking Ukrainian most of the time
On one occasion I started replying in Russian, and she said something like "why do you make me walk this uncanny valley
I don't know, because I completely quit Russian language which was my first language in childhood
But I don't think that my body language changed since then
I surely swear less, don't drink vodka anymore, and even don't pray to tsar, - but I believe it's about self-development and education, not language switch
>But my friends (also fully bilingual people) protested when I tried to speak Ukrainian to them because they were weirded out by the personality shift
>Something similar happened to my coworker who used to hear me speaking  Ukrainian most of the time
On one occasion I started replying in  Russian, and she said something like "why do you make me walk this  uncanny valley
I also got gigs like this, from both sides, when switched to Ukrainian completely
However, I believe it's about the image of the personality and its radical lingual shift, not some real changes of body language whatsoever
This is a good point
Edit: wanted to add that my Ukrainian vocab is a little more pretentious/bookish/flowery, and Russian is more relaxed/casual
Also, my tone of voice is slightly lower in Ukrainian because it drops to the chest
It seems like for me, there is some shift in personality or self-expression after all
No, most people don't speak any foreign language or speak just enough to ask for a dry towel in Turkey or haggle with an equally not-speaking-English Egyptian seller of trinkets
So like A1 tops
Some people are slightly ashamed of their helplessness abroad, so they come home and put some effort into English
Language schools, apps, Youtube channels and textbooks are always in demand
But since those people don't have enough stimulus at home, this initiative dies off after a couple month
So when someone actually speaks a foreign language decently, people react [like this] It's like being lazy and out of shape and then finding it in you to get in shape - some willpower has been put in it, and it gets the thumbs up
That's very weird
Almost everyone in Kiev can speak Russian if they choose to
Most importantly, absolutely everyone understands Russian
Source: am a Russian-speaking Ukrainian
But sometimes people can just be rude and speak Ukrainian even if you don't understand it at all
Witnessed this behaviour myself from an employee at an airport(!), who yelled at two clueless Israeli guys in Ukrainian
Felt ashamed of my countrymen
Russian isn't a foreign language
For historical reasons, most Ukrainians are fully bilingual (with one of the languages being the primary one)
However, we don't study Russian at school and it doesn't have the official status
>is Russian ability slowly shrinking
No, but since 2014, many bilingual people that used to speak Russian for convenience are now speaking Ukrainian and try to teach the kids to speak it as the language of choice
>And do Ukrainians think of Russian as one of (behind Ukrainian) "their" languages, or as the language of the invader
I don't know if you're in the mood for a long read, but here's a shorter answer: we think of Russian as of a native language, unless you ask a particularly nationalistic person (which we as Ukrainians have any right to be)
But most people tend to separate the language from the country
Putin himself, however, has said that Russia is everywhere people speak Russian
It's an ideological weapon and a propaganda tool of the so-called [Russkiy Mir] (the Russian World), so we need to be conscious and aware of its destructive powers
Depends on the region
I live in  oneof  the most Russian-speaking cities
My native language is absolutely Russian, not Ukrainian
Same goes for most of people here
People in the middle of the country mostly speak "surzhik", which is a mix of the two
People in the west speak Ukrainian and don't consider Russian their mother tongue
However, everyone in every region understands both languages, and having a conversation where each person speaks their mother tongue is very common
Putin is an oligarch and criminal authority
He's as set as one can get robbing a huge territory rich in oil, natural gas, diamonds, wood, etc for 20 years
And now his main objective is not to be prosecuted
He uses a fraction of these treasures to keep many politicians in the EU and in Asia in his pocket
Propaganda, threats and money work much better than niceties and good manners
We have a saying which we sometimes say to our visitors:
"feel yourself at home but don't forget that you're a guest".
It's a joke that has some didactic undertones
So e.g. if someone stays overnight, they're allowed to feel themselves at home, use the shower (gels, shampoos, etc
), walk around in a robe or pajamas, open the fridge and cupboards, make themselves a sandwich, use and wash the dishes, etc
The main meal like breakfast, lunch, or dinner is usually discussed so everyone knows which ingredients are for the cooking and what is being planned, so they don't just snack but adjust to the eating habits of the house (i.e., don't take what they like from the fridge)
Unless they're that kind of guests or really close friends that you've known for years, visitors aren't allowed to sneak around checking what's up
If they want to take something from the fridge, they just ask
No, basically every name that you want, probably except Hitler or something
Same for surnames
My colleague had gone to Stockholm a few weeks before us and told us Vasa wasn't really all that interesting and we could skip going there
When my husband and I still decided to go in, we were absolutely in awe of that beautiful ship and the way exhibition was built around it
To see such an amazing artifact is a rare feat and we spent several hours there on our short weekend trip
Skansen was great as well
I thought that Portugal was in South America
I don't remember, why
Maybe (just maybe) I thought that Portugal was a region within Brazil that gave the name to the language, just like Latin that comes from the Latium region, and then it went independent
...that Finland used to be one of the Soviet Republics (within the USSR), and that's why some Finns occurred in Russian movies speaking Russian with an accent, just like the Baltic countries nationals
Also, the fact that Bulgaria wasn't a part of the USSR was very confusing, because it was always talked of as if it was
...that common Frauen und Herren were unaware the Nazis were exterminating undesirable ethnicities in the Third Reich
I didn't know that [the Great Patriotic War] that started in 1941 wasn't exactly the same war as WWII that started in 1939
Also, every Ukrainian child learns that the geographical centre of Europe is in Ukrainian Transcarpathia
I didn't know there was/is [a competition]

I like the most blaser Lille e Rose from Blasercafe as I understand
But where I live(Kharkiv) we have SOOO many good places that sell coffee,mixes and blasers so understandably there probably a lot better ones
(I didn't experiment much as I'm a student)
If you love coffee and in Kharkiv, you are in for a treat, seriously
Й, і = and
В, у = in

Yeah, most of the prepositions are one-letter
Since the level of income might be dramatically different, people tend to be careful
But within the circle of colleagues it is not a taboo
I'll say that green are more popular, usually, I see black olives only on pizza
At the moment, unfortunately, our presidential party has a majority in parliament (248 out of 424) so we don't have the balance at all
But at least parliament and president were elected in a democratic way
It only causes problems and conflicts
Pro-Russian folks get really annoyed when Ukrainian language is spoken near them
Edit: I was born and live in Kharkiv (an almost 100% Russian-speaking city) and I like the laws supporting Ukrainian language, if someone's interested
It's 50/50 from what I've seen when I was traveling around Ukraine
In some places, it's almost 100% Russian, in some places it's 100% Ukrainian and in some the languages are mixed, like in Kyiv
Yes, quite well actually
The literature here thst was written in say about 13-15 century is wuite easy to read if you speak Ukrainian
>the word for door is always plural in Slovak
*"It's plural in Ukrainian too"*, I thought to myself, *"so why don't we
"*. And then I recalled, it's singular (and feminine) in Russian, so there's no clash in our minds
As for your question, the classic is "how do you feel yourself
" (i.e., how do you feel
In Ukrainian, it's "*як почуваєшСЯ/yak pochuvayeshSIA*" (a reflexive verb)
In Russian, it's "*как себя чувствуешь/kak sebia chuvstvuyesh"* (a transitive verb + reflexive pronoun)
Same in Russian
Those are rather narrow linguistic terms, so no shame in not knowing them
I only hope I get it right
A transitive verb requires an object, e.g., *to open [what
] a door*. Same in Russian, *открыть [что?] дверь*.
An example of an intransitive verb would be "to grow" as in "grass grows".
Reflexive pronouns are *yourself, myself,* etc
>is an average Ukrainian fluent in Russian
Sure, I thought it was common knowledge
De jure Ukrainian is the only state language, de facto in private life everyone uses the language they like
Do you use the calque OP mentioned
I.e.
>Slovaks say they "opened the doors"
[Yep] We have one
We got it in 2016, so a lot of people have a passport and not ID card
In Ukraine we have a biometric [ID Card]  which came in place of old Soviet style internal passports
Similar to countries in the EU, the card does allow some international travel including Turkey, Moldova, Georgia and Russia
Well, I like it too, it's a common feature among passports that it has blue-yellow theme:)
I also can distinguish between Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, and I'm not of an East Asian ethnicity
They just look different, although, sometimes there's a bland of features
Same for Europeans - they just look different, and it's not only about biology or fashion sense; people of the same nationality often have similar facial expressions
My theory, keeping the same set of facial expressions for years influences your facial muscles
Obviously, I have the highest success rate with Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians, and there's a difference between these three which I can't explain, it's just a hunch
Then there are Poles and Czechs
Their faces are "Ukrainian" but longer and more angular
E.g., an average Ukrainian face of a male is oval with a tendency to an upside-down egg, the nose is rounded and the cheeks are puffy
A Polish dude also has an oval face, but this upside-down egg has a cleft chin or more pronounced cheekbones
A Czech dude's face is an upside-down egg with two yolks, and the nose is pointy
Then there're Germans whose faces are rectangular or square, with a wide but short chin
If it's a quite similar face, but narrower, with a longer chin and overall smaller features, I suspect an Austrian
Everything above is subjective and only applicable to ethnic majorities of the aforementioned countries
When it comes to facial expressions, I can't put this feeling into words
Definitely not in Odesa
The best ones are surprisingly near Mariupol in the East
Good, clean beaches and nobody's there, since it's quite close to the war zone (yet completely safe)
"History of Ukraine" seems to only exist in Ukraine, right
Yeah, from my experience with this sub, having two different subjects  covering home history and history of other countries is uncommon
That's why we know their history but they're not sure where we're on the map
IIRC, even in Russia they only have one
Also, fundamentals of law (правознавство) or astronomy (астрономія) which is like physics, but in space
And ОБЖД (fundamentals of safety)
As for subject that don't exist in Ukraine, I'd say, it's religion
If there's even such subject, it's extracurricular and voluntary
We have  "History of Ukraine" and "World History" ( or "Foreign History") as separate subjects
At least it was like when i was in school, and that was more than a decade ago
Sorry for the late answer
When I was in school, he was showcased as a national hero and so on
But the eventual consequences of the Pereyaslav Council with Russia wasn't mentioned, as i remember
In general, he has a rather positive view here rather than a negative, but he is criticized for union with Russia and someone also criticizes his alliance with Crimean Tatars (we weren't friends back in those days) - both alliances didn't end well for Ukrainians
Yes, as for example:
Russia:  Ukranian-Soviet war ( 1917–21),  Holodomor (great famine in 1932-1933), UPA status
From recent - Crimea and Donbass
Poland: all differences are mostly about views on UPA and Bandera
That not  exhaustive list, though
*sort comments by controversial*
The Great Patriotic War (1941-45) was essentially equated with WWII, and the USSR almost single-handedly won this war
Lots of memorials and common graves in every town and village with those two dates:
* *1941-1945 will not forget, will not forgive*
Also, the famous [Molotov's speech] from 22
1941
> Today at 4 o'clock a.m., without any claims having been presented to the Soviet Union, without a declaration of war, German troops attacked our country, attacked our borders at many points and bombed from their airplanes our cities
Edit: I expand on the parent reply explaining how the concept of WWII was replaced with the Great Patriotic War in the USSR and how it was presented to the public
It's a historical fact, not my own POV
It's not "some Russians". For the vast majority of Russians, Katyn either didn't happen or it was justified
Yes, I have a box dedicated to my home clothes that include summer and winter items as well as clothes intended for doing maintenance work (e.g., painting a surface) or going to a forest
Those clothes are regularly washed just like the rest of the wardrobe, it's just they're not as presentable or fitting, etc
Second-tier clothes
When I was younger and we didn't have many items of clothing, home clothes were the ruined ones, with persistent stains or holes; now I just buy some soft linen/viscose/fleece items from thrift stores and wear them at home
Not everyone uses them
Yeah, it's even called "Putin - Fucker"
More like "Putin - Dickhead"
Also many of our folk songs or marches are about fighting Polish, Russians or Bolsheviks (Even older version of national anthem had lyrics about borders from River Sian to River Don, which are in Poland and Russia respectively at the moment)
Sunce slobode sada nam sviće
Yeah, or even from River Sian to Caucasus Mountains
"Зробились ми великої години"?
To be fair, I can't say these songs are really popular
The closest I can think of are the newer songs about the war and about our enemies
I think those songs might be slightly, just slightly, offensive
Al' jedan je Mauzer
Vi ste hrabri momci
I play mostly The New Order for hoi iv

In Ukraine it's a village near Kyiv called Петропавлівська Борщагівка (Petropavlivśka Borščahivka), which is 25 letters long, so not that long compared to all the others in this thread
Петропавлівська Борщагівка.
The village is located near Kyiv and it's name consists of 25 letters
[Mezhyhirya] an absolutely filthy rich place that formerly belonged to Yanukovich, now it's a museum
140 ha with a yacht pier, an equestrian club, a shooting range, a tennis court, a private zoo, an automobile museum, a golf course, an ostrich farm, a barge, a dog kennel, and a private zoo
And all this for one man, built on the money of Ukrainian taxpayers
And inside it is just more filthy rich than outside, museum of corruption if you want

I think this is something similar to Ukrainian "Puzata Hata", this means "paunchy house"
A Ukrainian quasitraditional song became a widely know Christmas song after translating into English
Guess, what's the song
We call it Шпаргалка - shpargalka - which comes from some Polish word
Also, there's бомба - bomb - which means pre-solved task
and also "shpora" means "a spur". Similarity is coincidental
Makes sense
Your typical shpargalka looks like that
No lockers, only backpacks only hardcore
But seriously, there was time where I watched a lot of American films and decided to ask school for lockers as well but nothing came out of it ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Ukraine, Norway, Italy, Croatia looks great
People have accents and melodies from their native languages, and after they've managed to acquire a native-like pronunciation, their sentences may retain bits of their native grammar or vocab
Also, non-native speakers use fewer idiomatic phrases like, I don't know
See, sometimes it's easier for me as a non-native speaker to just describe something than to use an idiomatic phrase
E.g., I know what "old as the hills" means, but if I didn't, I'd say "very old". It's still correct, but less metaphoric/more precise
Online it also works vice versa, when you know an idiom from your native language, and someone writing in English uses a calque of this idiom
E.g., to feed with promises
Do you understand the meaning
Yes
Do I understand it's a calque of an idiom
Also yes
And so I suspect this person is not a native English speaker
Offtop: Just add **?t=1m45s** or **?t=105** (where 105 is a number of seconds since start) to the link
How did you differentiate them from a Spanish or Portuguese person
They use the same word for "driver". Also, the Italian language has the same cognate "conducente".
You "make the oaktree" or "throw out the shoes" or "glue [together] the flippers". No biting
Corruption and ignorance of most part of people to an active conflict with Russia in eastern part of country
[KAZKA - Плакала] is still very popular
Any track from [Alyona Alyona]
Unfortunately music in Ukrainian language isn't very popular in Ukraine itself, so there are not so many popular tracks, that I can think of
we already have east vs west but Budjak on the enthnic map looks like its own Balkans
Donetsk, Lugansk and Crimea were, but they're already little out
I'd say it's either southern Bessarabia with all those ethnicities, or Azov sea coast, same
Maybe, Hutsulshchyna
but Ukrainians Bulgarians Romanians Gagauzians Russians and Albanians in such small peice of land is crazy
Budjak is a better name than South Bessarabia IMO
I wholeheartedly agree

This is our alive meme, song about erotic things
Lotta singers in our country make crap music
Like Oleg Vynnik, for example
Literally only 14 year old instagrammer girls who think they have a good taste in music and middle-aged single women listen to his songs
I really like ours, even though it's kinda desperate and we are always on the brink of death or dying, but the lyrics are very inspiring
How we are never going to give up on our country and will kill our enemies in spite of everything
It reminds me of some books, where a hero is going against fate, so it's probably sounds a little clichéd but I like it
I like the melody, but I think that the lyrics are too patriotic
It depends on the season
In winter we mostly have imported apples and some late/hard local apples - 2-5 varieties altogether
In summer-autumn, the assortment also includes local seasonal apples with soft and juicy apple meat
At least 5 varieties of apples altogether, but usually more
**Winter apples:**
* [Semerenko] - they might look like Granny Smith, but they're much harder and much sourer, not very juicy
This variety is rich in iron and can be stored through the whole cold season
* [Granny Smith]
* [Golden] - apparently, called Golden Delicious, but here they're known as just Golden
An imported variety and available throughout the year
* [Red chief] - hard sweet apples available in winter
* [Ligol] - great winter apples; juicy, sour and sweet, medium-hard
* [Champion] - they're sweet and mushy, with a hint of sourness
Can be stored in winter
* [Idared] - big and not very hard apples, sweet with a hint of sour, tour potato-ish in winter
* [No-name] - there's also this variety of apples that is medium or small in size and might look decent, but they taste as a cellar smells
**Summer-autumn apples:**
* all of the above
* [Doneshta] - a local summer variety; one of the best apples - they're often huge, juicy, mushy but not soft and taste with a hint of vanilla
* [Bilyi nalyv] - WIKI translates it as White Transparent
An early apple variety which is very common in Ukraine
It's a stray cat of apples, rather small and juicy, grows everywhere including forests
* [Glory to winners] known as Glory ("Слава/Slava") - another great summer variety, juicy and mostly sour, but with some sweetness and, just like Doneshta, a hint of vanilla
* [Gala] - small-ish sweet apples available through the whole autumn
* [Gloster] - great autumn apples, sour/sweet and juicy, that are hard enough to be stored in winter, but they turn into potatoes rather quickly
yes, I just got inspired to write a lengthy reply about apples, don't judge, you'll understand one day
lol
Green ("white filling", usually from east), red (usually from Karpaty and near Romania) and hybrid (apple + pear etc
Coming down from mountainside
I'm surprised that you guys still use a word "walkie-talkie". I thought it's left in 2000's. :)
As for Ukrainian, can't tell
We have a developed system of diminution, so literally every word (even verbs) can be transformed in "childish" forms
Also, some coutry-side dialects sound a bit childish to my ear
I believe that's because Russian influenced urban Ukrainian a lot - and Russian is much a gruffer language
In Ukrainian  for me it's word "pig" with a 'village' dialect
Normally it's 'свиня' but with dialect it's 'пацє' and that's so funny to me
We do the in Ukrainian
Same in Hebrew
Apple - tapuah (תפוח)
Potato - tapuah adama(תפוח אדמה)
Adama means earth/ground
Not a native, but articles
They are so hard to use correctly
I use commas and other punctuation the way I'd use it in Ukrainian or Russian
For these languages, punctuation is almost as important as grammar, especially for a linguist or journalist, etc
Sometimes I wonder if I use too much, but otherwise, the melody of the sentence breaks, and it's difficult to read
Nope, "I'm walking to school now" is the correct one
It usually happens when people try to make their sentences on their language first and then to translate it to English
In Ukraine we "engage in sex"
Food
I guess, we eat it as much as you: in pastry, in the traditional Christmas dish called [кутя/kutia] We also have [poppy seed cakes]
Also, kids just cut the top from a ripe dried poppy seed box and eat the seeds
I did it myself - snatched poppy from my grandma who had it after "Маковія/Makoviya" (a religious holiday on which people bring flowers and poppy to the church)
In the 90s, the awareness of the poppy as the source for opium rose
People in the countryside were complaining that their poppy was being stolen by drug addicts, even the stems without seed boxes were in demand
The amount of cultivated poppy in individual households has greatly diminished since then
E.g., grandma always had a few rows of poppies next to corn, sunflowers, and squashes, but she stopped cultivating it not to tempt the thieves
Also, if I'm not mistaken, the people that cultivated poppy were suspected of the intent of selling it to opium makers
But today wheat fields still have wild red poppies in them, as well as daisies and cornflowers
Besides, all that poppy in pastry has to be cultivated somewhere
They are very often used in bakery
Loved the poppy seed pierozhki as a child, and still love them now to the point that my preferred way to die is to choke on a poppy seed pie
poppy even gave name to piece of cutlery, [макогін]
There's "чернуха/chernukha" (Russian: *blackness*, casual/habitual misery)
> Pessimistic neo-naturalism and muckraking during and after glasnost
> Chernukha is a slang term popularized in the late 1980s, used to describe a tendency toward unrelenting negativity and pessimism both in the arts and in the mass media
Derived from the Russian word for "black" (cherny), chernukha began as a perestroika phenomenon, a rejection of the enforced optimism of official Soviet culture
It arose simultaneously in three particular areas: "serious" fiction (published in "thick" journals such as Novy mir ), film, and investigative reporting
One of the hallmarks of Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost was the open discussion of the misery and violence that was a part of everyday Soviet life, transforming the form and content of the nation's news coverage

Not from anywhere, because you really don't want ukranian education system
Will be, trust me
English is easy to learn because it's literally everywhere
Nah, not only it's grammar is far easier than the most of European languages, but it's pop culture sphere is the biggest of all languages
Very easy
One of the easiest languages to learn as a foreign language
Well, I started to learn it at 4 years old
It was hard to learn, but now I can speak with you
Btw i am still learning it
Not so hard to start speaking with proper training
But i realy don't like many of rules wich make no sence, for exemple writing and speling of words where one letter can make 3 sounds or not make sound at all
I’m from Ukraine but I’ve spoken Russian all my life
Correct me if I’m wrong but English seems to be extremely different from Russian
The construction of sentences, the pronunciation, alphabet and grammar are kinda far away from each other
Sometimes I can use correct words and formula but it can make zero sense to the English speaking people
However, I find English to be one of the easiest languages to learn (I speak Russian, Ukrainian, German and Norwegian) especially due to it’s popularity and availability of books, guides, free content
It's not a city but a region: Ukrainian Galicia is Галичина (~Halychyna)
Beijing - Пекін (Pekin) comes to mind
Many of the German ones apply too, since we usually use German pronouciation and not English one
Not a city, but
Hungary - Угорщина (Ugorshchyna)
Beijing - Пекін (Pekin);
Vienna - Відень (Viden')
There may be more, but I can't remember
Ukrainian name for Wien is different from both English and Austrian/German names
Відень (smth like "Viden'")
What can you buy for 1, 10 and 100 of your currency in your country
For example, here in Ukraine you can buy a box of matches for 1 hryvnia, a small bag of crisps for 10 hryvnia and half a kilogramme of cheese for 100 hryvnia
That's a lot of garments
Inflation hit you guys hard, I guess
I get the 1 DKK part, you can't really buy much with 1 hryvnia here either
You've got some cheap milk though
You can buy three days worth of food for 10 euro worth of money here, lol
That's some pricy cinnamon powder
You can get 3-5 cinnamon buns or 5-10 cinnamon powder bags(~10-35 grams) here for 10 NOK worth of money
>decent source
Meaning you can buy even more, should it be a fishy middle eastern-looking guy at a kebab stall
100 euro would equate to at least month's worth of food here, if you're a student, it can be your budget for a season
I heard that in France baguettes are cheap but this clears up a lot
They're about the same price here btw
Quite self explanatory
I somehow relate to those seemingly inflated prices
The small bag of crisps I mentioned in the OP used to cost 3 hryvnia back before our economy got fucked up thanks to a certain neighbour
Self explanatory, considering that prostitution is legal in Germany, if I'm not mistaken
I like the concept of a monthly ticket allowing to get a train to anywhere across the country
It just sounds so convenient
Either your prices are even lower than ours or that is a very mediocre ice cream
Is maple syrup as good as they say
I like no-name Chinese candy but if I eat more than 3 in a short time span, I feel like I'm going to throw up
That's some expensive vodka
I'm not really into alcohol but as far as I know, you can buy at least a litre of alright vodka here for 100 SEK worth of money
Inflation hit us hard
I remember buying a kilogramme of the same cheese back in 2008 for 40 hryvnia
And yeah, our matches are strangely cheap, no matter how low our currency gets
I love locally made cheeses and they cost a bit cheaper here but that's if you know where to buy
If you go to some villages in the Carpathians, you can get whole 6 kilos for that much
Some other people replied with higher prices so I pointed that out, that's all
We have our milk even cheaper btw, at around 15-30 hryvnia/litre that amounts to around 0
5-1 euro/litre
Ah, alright
That makes train travel way more expensive
Cursive for Cyrillic languages and printed-like for Latin languages, except German for some reason
Cursive (connected letters) from the first grade
The print is what preschoolers write in
Around middle school, students start to develop their own style of handwriting, and some use print-like elements like the lowercase **T** or a snowflake-like **Ж**.
I use two handwriting styles: regular cursive and a much more compact print-like handwriting
omg, I thought it only was my school, that wanted me to write German in cursive
I actually never learned to write printed
It's slow and why would I do it
All handwriting is cursive
I guess it's pretty standard: the capital for being assholes who hemmorage money, Lviv for being posh (Lviv also gets a whole separate nomination because they fancy themselves the Silicon Valley of Ukraine) and Donbass for being postindustrial degenerates who literally shot themselves in the foot to show them khokhols

Gun violence
>Left wing violence is nothing compared to right wing violence
You are telling this to someone from a country where both communist and nazi regimes killed millions of innocent people
I do not support both right- and left-wing extremists, in case you thought that I support the rightists
>gun violence isn’t really something to complain about when your nation is literally fighting a war in the east against rebels
Even though you don't have a war in your country, more people die from gun violence every year in the US than in the east of Ukraine (10200+(civillians included) for Donbass war since 2014, compare that to US annual gun homicide statistics)
Dragging attention from thousands of gun homicides to an actual war is a dick move
>rebels
Yeah, and Russian citizens including professional military just went hiking near Ukrainian border and got lost
Oh, and some of them were on tanks, but that's just Russia, everything is possible there
I was talking about Ukraine
It was about gun violence, not just homicide rate
Well yes, but not all gun violence acts have dead victims

That would either be [Eneïda] by Ivan Kotlyarevsky, a remap of the original **Aeneid,** or [Zapovit] by Taras Shevchenko
Strikingly different in their mood, yet both reflect the Ukrainian psyche quite well
Coincidentally, we also have Aeneid also known as *Kotliarevsyi's Eneyida*. It has words like "whore's daughter" and all of that Virgil's literary heritage
> Eneyida is a Ukrainian burlesque poem, written by Ivan Kotlyarevsky in 1798
This mock-heroic poem is considered to be the first literary work published wholly in the modern Ukrainian language
Although Ukrainian was an everyday language to millions of people in Ukraine, it was officially discouraged from literary use in the area controlled by Imperial Russia
> Eneyida is a parody of Virgil's Aeneid, where Kotlyarevsky transformed the Trojan heroes into Zaporozhian Cossacks
Critics believe that it was written in the light of the destruction of Zaporizhian Host by the order of Catherine the Great
The poem was written during the formation of romanticism and nationalism in Europe
At that time, part of the Ukrainian elite was gripped by nostalgia for the Cossack state, which was liquidated by Russia in 1775–1786
> The first three parts of the poem were published in 1798 in St
Petersburg, without the author's knowledge
The complete «Eneyida» was published after Kotlyarevsky's death in 1842
> The poem is in top-100 list by «From Skovoroda to modern time: 100 most important creative art in Ukrainian».
**An excerpt**:
Aeneas was a lively fellow
And quite a Cossack for a lad,
For mischief he was more than mellow
While courage above all he had
But when the Greeks felt very bitter
And made of Troy a heap of litter
He took a bag, and with a lust -
With some good Troyans whom he gathered
Whose hides were tough and necks well lethered -
He showed old Troy a cloud of dust
He quickly built some boats of timber,
Then launched them in the quiet sea
And filling them with muscle limber
He hit the foam where eyes could see
But cackling Juno, dog-gone-daughter,
Kept cackling like a hen for water;
-That's how Aeneas lacked her grace -
A long long time she had been praying:
She wished his soul would stop delaying
The trip to that unearthly place
So many hedgehogs in cities
They live off the trash, I guess
One time I consecutively saw three hedgehogs ~100 m one from another (maybe they were a family)
Not sure if we have anyone else
In a smaller city where people have garden plots, there're wild boars
They come and dig gardens
I used to live in a small military town, and we had roe deer, hares, and boars
We usually were concerned with the boars while going deeper into the nature
Edit: I misread a little
We do have stray cats and dogs in the streets
Usually, cats
Dogs live in more desolated places like industrial areas, but they often can be heard
They also come closer to check what's up
I live in Kyiv (\~3m population) we have many hedgehogs and squirrels + some beavers
The city is surrounded by forests, so sometimes we find forest guests like [moose]
PS: ofc we have many cats, dogs, ducks, etc, but that's not what you're asking about I believe
It basically solidified the reputation of FIFA as one of the most corrupt organisation in the world

We say Chekhiya, but I'll call it whatever Czechs themselves prefer if there's an issue
In Ukraine everyone calls it Czechia anyway
We already call it Czechia
* Envy is "*заздрощі/zazdroshchi*" - it's when someone wants what another person has
* Jealousy - "*ревнощі/revnoshchi*" - for when a person is envious of the attention their love interest or parent/friend/etc gives to someone else
It's often romantic but not necessarily
For example, a child can be jealous when their baby sibling gets all the attention
Out of the pair zazdroshchi/zazdrist the singular zazdrist is a lot more common as the equivalent of "envy".
The same plural/singular pair exists for jealousy - revnoshchi/revnist, but the singular revnist is very rarely, if ever, used to mean jealousy, and mostly means diligence
Russian is a complex language
Even if your command of its grammar is near-perfect, you still have doubts about spelling, commas, hyphens, subordinate clauses, etc
That's why they argue, not because they speak different dialects
Russian only has regional words and phrases

We have [the Internet Party of Ukraine] Once they tried to nominate [a man named Darth Vader] in the presidential elections
"Internet party of Ukraine". It's nominees have names changed to those of star wars characters, and wear costumes of them in public
In 2014 Darth Vader even wanted to run for presidency, but got rejected by Central Election Commission because he denied to take his mask off
This would be the most popular party here

My opinion, our meme culture degraded into 2010 meme templates, and I. am not Ok with that
Also, our memes usually making grammar mistakes and lowering overall quality on purpose
And I am not ok with that and their "post irony". [

What about "you're welcome"?
Kropyvnytskyi in the middle
Noone knows anyone from there
Fine, really
In terms of city names most became much easier - Dnipropetrovsk to Dnipro (which everyone was using anyway), Dniprodzerzhynsk (which was a goddamn nightmare to pronounce in any language) to Kamyanske
In Kropyvnytskyi there was a popular idea to rename it to "Zlatopil" (similar to Ternopil) which personally would make more sense, but Kropyvnytskyi is probably the most famous person from there, so it's alright
And in terms of name complexity is pretty similar to the old one, so not much changed there
Also there was an idea to return to the original Yelysovetgrad but that's again way to many consonants in a row for Ukrainian language and sounds odd
Also there is a movement to rename Western Ukrainian cities back to pre-soviet names (like Ivano-Frankivsk back to Stanislaw, which makes sense since Franko lived in Lviv his entire life anyway) but the people those cities are named for now are usually much more popular and reveared in Ukraine so I don't think it's going anywhere
It does sound odd, that's true, but at least it makes sense, cause the region is "Red Ruthenia"
it was, but not all cities that were renamed by the Soviets are subject for decommunisation
Basically, if it doesn't have a name of a soviet politician or a clear reference to USSR - it's up to the city itself
And seems like Chervonograd has a position: "it would be nice to return Krystynopil, but it seems like too much hustle"

We use standard Slavic layout ЙЦУКЕН. With some added letters like І, Ї, Ґ and Є

I think he also lives in  Chrząszczyżewoszyce, powiat Łękołody ^(/s)
They're not really Russian though, they're basically the same Greek names as Alexander or Michael or Nicholas or Alexis
Our versions would be respectively Oleksander, Mychailo, Mycola, and Olexy

Russia: Everyone knows current relationships between us and we see them as the real threat

1943 happend
Cossack period ( 1648–1775 ) - times of uprising, unwilling alliances, betrayals
Also, it's easy to fit other nations like  Tsardom of Russia, Crimean Khanate, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Swedish Empire
UPR times (1918-1921) where you can easily because leaders of it prefer to fight each other rather unite against external enemies that can be fit into assassin/templars shenanigans

The newest term is "*тітушко/titushko*" (plural, "*тітушки/titushky*") - thugs hired by different political forces to either pacify or provoke protesters, or pose as them to create a negative social image (within the country and in foreign media)
From [Wiki]
> **Titushky** are mercenary agents who supported the Ukrainian police force during the administration of Viktor Yanukovych, often posing as street hooligans with the express purpose of performing illegal acts
Titushki raid is a widely used term in Ukrainian mass media and by the general public to describe street beatings, carjackings and kidnappings by unidentified men in civilian clothes from behind the lines of political rallies
>Titushky were employed by the Yanukovych government with having reportedly 200 hryven' to $100 per day in payments
Some of them were also suspected to be illegal formations of combat troops carrying concealed pistols
The one purpose titushky served was the intimidation and dispersal of anti-governmental demonstrations and attacks on participants and representative of the media
> Titushky adopted the strategy of blending into a peaceful crowd or mob and then instigating a violent fight between them which always lead to arrests of peaceful protesters on the grounds of mass disorder; perpetrators were then used either as "witnesses" of the committed "crime" or as "victims". During the events in Ukraine in 2013-2014 known as Euromaidan, they became a collective term for provocateurs and thugs hired by the Party of Regions and law enforcement agents in civilian clothing
Supporters of President Yanukovich also used the term 'tituskhy' to refer to pro-opposition thugs
Basically, they're the newest step in gopniks' evolution
The name "*тітушки/titushky*" (plural) comes from the surname of Vadim Titushko - [a guy] that you'd certainly fall in love with, Reddit
[Just look at him go] He's a former martial artist and a present-day criminal
And [this is] a more general image of *titushky* on duty
Gopniks
Gopniks
They're primitive (usually) provincials lacking self-awareness, or even more literally - "cattle" (рагуль - рогатий); same as *bydlo*. In other words, it's a state of mind, not a subculture or social class
The term can be applied to any nationality as well as city dwellers, as long as they fit the criteria
Ukrainian here, my mother tongue is Russian and I speak Russian daily but can also understand and speak Ukrainian(because we all learn it, duh)
From my interactions with Russians I can tell that they usually can't understand spoken Ukrainian and have trouble reading it
As for myself, knowing two Slavic languages makes things a bit easier
Belarussian is very close to Ukrainian, so I understand it almost perfectly, and what's funny - spoken is much easier than written
Their writing looks a bit weird for our eye
Any other Slavic language spoken is complete gibberish because Eastern languages have distinct phonetics and our ears aren't used to others
Written, Bulgarian looks literally like Russian written with a bunch of mistakes
I even seriously thought so in hotels sometimes
Polish is hard to understand but you can get the gist
Czech is a bit harder
Can't speak about Serbian though
My first languages are Ukrainian and Russian, so I understand Belarusian, Polish and Czech languages pretty well (didn't encounter Slovakian, but I don't think it would be a difficulty to me)
I understand a bit of Bulgarian, but Slovenian and Serbo-Croatian are gibberish to me
It's a very good question
Depends on the school, but lately it's mostly Ukrainian
Documentation is only in Ukrainian
Speaking usually depends on the region
I live in a Russian-speaking city, hearing Ukrainian here is pretty rare unless you're talking to staff in stores etc
You can also start speaking Russian to anyone in the west(Ukrainian  dominated) and they will understand you and respond in Ukrainian
All of us understand both languages but not all of us speak both of them equally well and comfortably, including me
My Ukrainian is subpar and clearly needs polishing, so I usually just speak Russian
Most of Ukrainuan speakers from Western regions don't speak Russian at all, but still understand perfectly
Dude, I almost fell off my chair
That's a really good one
Yes, and they're already kind of independent (if you can call being a puppet of Russia independence), but we are at war with them

My favourite is probably плачу (plachu) - "I'm paying" and "I'm crying"
Onion and bow (for archery) are both "лук" (look)

I identity myself first as foremost as Ukrainian, then as a western Ukrainian, then as a European and then as a Slav
"Schedule" - I heard at least a few versions of pronouncing and I don`t know which is right, like it's [sheh jool] or [skeh jool]
And also a "Queue"
Crap
Thanks
Ireland
Even if the experience isn't identical, I feel like I can have a chat with an Irishman because they know what a great famine is, how it feels like having the native language suppressed and artists/writers assigned to another country because they spoke/wrote in the more prestigious language of that country, etc
That's Belarus
Although, potato is the language we all speak fluently
Ireland's [azure blue] + [yellow]
On this note, welcome to Ukraine if you dare :) (if you haven't been already)
Russian in Ukraine was strong up until it shot itself in the foot
Now it's the language in which one calls for a pale guy wearing elevated soles to "send in the troops".
There are people that speak Russian and pass it to their children, and believe it's very convenient that we can speak Russian in some former Soviet countries
But there are also people that are bilingual, i.e. have a choice both ways, but they decide to left Russian behind and pass only Ukrainian to their children
I think it makes a big enough dent in Russian's rep of the dominant language in the cultural domain
It's the language of forced poverty and wasted opportunities in a land of oil, gas, diamonds, and timber
P.S.: do the Irish love pathos as much as Ukrainians
> roaming charges
If I understand correctly, you need a mobile data package
In Ukraine, you can buy a local SIM which is relatively cheap and doesn't require any contract
Pick Kyivstar for better coverage
In Ukraine, in big cities, road signs, names of streets, city transport stops, and  announcement in it, are dubbed in English, just for the notice
>Do you mean pathos (if so I don't know what that means) or is that a typo of potatoes
It's actually *potathos*.
(I was jokingly hinting at my own [pathos] in the previous reply)
>Russian would have to become a complete foreign language like it is to Poland
The main objective at the moment is to make everything available in Russian also available in Ukrainian: books, movies, TV-shows, youtube, etc
In some domains like education and service, Ukrainian is being enforced to reverse the process (Russian has been being enforced here for the last 400 years)
Although enforced is a strong word
Let's say, supported by the law so a waitress couldn't deny a visitor service in Ukrainian like it was just up to this February
So maybe it's not reflected by the study but the steps are being made
Hope it works
Also for /u/CrocPB
Every time I ride those suburban or intercity electric trains where you don't have an assigned seat (приміські та міжміські поїзди), I wonder how a foreigner in Ukraine can possibly use them
First, you hear the name of a (!) station mumbled through speakers
It's 99% incomprehensible, just sounds of a victim being choked
Is it *your* station
Who knows
Then, you ask someone, but they don't speak English
You clearly name the stop you need; they start explaining something in a language you don't understand
Then you try to use Google Maps with GPS, but because of the train speed the GPS position is lagging behind and you miss your station or frantically leap and fall through the doors outside because the duration of a minor stop is usually 1-2 min
> I'd heard it before but didn't really know what it meant
We use this word quite often (*пафос*, also *патетика* i.e. emphatic theatrical suffering), so the English adjective *pathetic* meaning sad/pitiful sounds to me a little
counterproductive
>Companies are required to serve people in Ukrainian
Exactly
Everything facing the client, whether it's a service person, a menu, or a website, has to be in Ukrainian by default
Then, if the client wishes to switch to Russian or English, they can ask, and the service person can agree
Also, the majority of business websites usually have a fully-functioning Russian version which used to be the default one
Now the default one has to be in Ukrainian, and then you can switch
When you call, e.g, your internet provider, the initial addressing is in Ukrainian, then they allow you to press 1 for Ukrainian, 2 for Russian, and 3 for English
>People want to watch the highest quality movies and TV shows
Honestly, I'd like Ukrainians to be motivated enough to watch those movies and shows in the original language
As of now, the choice is usually between the Russian dub and the Ukrainian dub, which one comes sooner and has more appeal
So people try to make great Ukrainian dubs
Even Youtube is dubbed, you wouldn't believe how linguistically apathetic some people here are
They also don't travel enough to feel uncomfortable enough to learn a foreign language or two
And as for Russian, it has almost completely replaced Belarusian in Belarus, but not Ukrainian in Ukraine, so there's something we're doing right
There's the major city  with literally the same name in Belarus
Yeah, but now it is called just "Brest"

it is so cool in Germany, Denmark to get fresh steaming loaf of bread early in the morning at local Bäckerei

I don't even know a tune of an American one lol that's my knowledge of international anthems

Southern Ukraine here
We do get tons of lake-effect snow (up to 50-60 cm in certain places) 2-3 times a year when storms from the Mediterranean pass over the Black Sea
It’s usually gone in a day, and everything stops until it melts - I was once stranded in a neighboring city for 2 days as I didn’t listen to the storm warning and decided to drive nevertheless
Paying closer attention now thanks to this valuable lesson
But yes, winters are getting milder for sure
It is in general accepted, but considered teen-ish
I feel like on a woman it would be accepted as women here tend to be on the more decorated side
On men in a workplace - no, because men usually don't decorate themselves even with earrings, and other visible piercing draws even more attention
A guy with studs/tunnels in ears is seen as some alternative type that doesn't spend his time in a usual workspace
A girl with bigger ear tunnels too, tbf
However, all piercing that is not in ears is seen as a thing that people grow out of, so as women grow older, they tend to remove it to be perceived serious
There are many of them because of us being ex-soviet country
Our current president is a former actor and comedian
His campaign started way before the elections when he produced and starred in a TV show called "Servant of the People" where he played an ordinary guy that accidentally was elected to be the president of Ukraine
Anyway, in this show he was so humble and democratic he was using a bike to get to work instead of the usual luxurious cars politicians use
Naturally, after the elections, he ~~started~~ continued to use luxurious cars (he's a rich dude) and also surrounded himself with a security cortege
During a diplomatic visit the president of Estonia [presented him with a bike] We appreciated the trolling
Also, there's a Pakistani (?) animation about a [donkey king] The main character, apparently, turned out to be an unintentional parody of Zelenskyi
Even the dubbing has a few of his catchphrases
Aside from that, there's an alternative dubbing of the trailer to this movie remade into a full-blown parody of Zelenskyi
The Donkey King is one of his newest nicknames
He's a joke himself
Just realizing that he's a president in real life is such tragicomedy that we need no other jokes
Our country leader is an ex stand up comedian, what are we even taking about
“[Get out of here, robber] “
In fact, he's viewed same as Trump in the USA, popular among workers, housewives and so on
"Intelligentsia" hates him, but they're minority, most people like how he's ruling
As an example in December he called all CEOs of big Ukrainian gas companies and said them that tomorrow price for gas should be \~10% reduced because people want to celebrate Christmas without worrying about gas price
(as you understand that's not what he can do, especially in premier-presidential system) But people who're watching TV likes him
PS: in new year's speech his main idea was "doesn't matter what's the name of street, or whose monument is on street important is only that street is with new asphalt and that next to those monument couples are meeting for date". Idea, which is popular among people who don't think that national identity is important

For us, the best-known person from the Wiśniowiecki dynasty is [Dmytro Vyshnevetsky] Jarema is usually viewed as an enemy coz he was against Khmelnytsky, but the role of the main enemy in this war definitely belongs to Mikołaj "Bearpaw" Potocki
Michał  Wiśniowiecki is known only by people who're more or less interested in history because he ruled in a period when Ukraine wasn't part of Rzeczpospolita, and overall the Ruin  (1659 - 1686) period is super complicated so regular people don't know much about it
You're right, that's a thing about our historiography, in many cases for us Ukraine = Kyiv so when Kyiv stopped being part of Rzeczpospolita in our mind Ukraine stopped being part of Rzeczpospolita too
And I guess that the Potocki dynasty is maybe even better known in Ukraine than Wiśniowiecki
PS: the village where my ancestors came from was owned by the Potocki family
PPS: and clearly the most famous noble family in Ukraine is Ostrogski
Now when I think about it, I assume that Dmytro Vyshnevetsky is so well known coz we have an old Cossack [duma] about him (created in 16-17 century) but obviously have nothing about Jarema or Michał.
[In Ukrainian]
[In Belarusian]
PS: BTW we have [duma that mentions Mikołaj Potocki]
We have a shitload of balconies (I have three in my own apartment) but since drunk tourists don't usually stay in residential high-rises, this is not a problem

I find English more concise than my native languages
Not only I but also other people have noticed that emotional stuff is less gushy in English
Even when I read translated snippets of famous books that are originally in Ukrainian or Russian, I find the English translation more straight to the point, while the original is often very suffix-y and wordy; a lot of information comes from the author's tone
The translation reads like a document with first and foremost information and then all the decorative and emotional stuff that the translator chose to include
Not bad
Not too hard
But in my language you can determine spelling by hearing in most cases, if only English work this way
And order of words to important
I am from Ukraine
It is very easy with nouns forms and verbs forms
But the pronounce is weird imo
If it's not too difficult for you to find the study, I'd like to read it
What I mean is, an English sentence is often packed with information
*In my village, there was a man who had a red fat cat

I mean, a translator chooses how to translate, but look how every option influences the mood while in the English sentence it's all at once unless something else is added/specified
It sounds not too bad in English, but a neutral word-for-word translation to Russian sounds poor because it's a story, not a criminal report
>Again, it all depends on what mood we choose, a modern story, a fairy tale etc
Yes, it was my point as well
A story is a story and a translator makes a choice on how to deliver it with the means of another language
But it's not as much about the means and the adequacy of translation as to how compact and precise English is comparing to some other languages, and it doesn't look poor as long as you read in English
Thank you for the links and the added explanation
In other words, I've encountered this in action when people would listen to something in a foreign language with phrases in their native language scattered all over it
They admitted that the phrases in their native language almost sounded louder or closer to them physically (it felt so)
They were native English speakers, btw
Although, you might agree that when we start using all those words from English and become annoying people that use a lot of English words and phrases, we don't feel that they're emotionally less charged
E.g, you hit your little toe against something and exclaim
Either aah, or сука, or fuck, or maybe ааа факинг сука, who knows
>I'm not sure what you mean by English sentences being packed with information
It can be my insufficient explanation or maybe we just perceive it differently
To be honest, it's one of those things where I can say *so be it* without any negativity
How I see it
1) Might be the difference between an analytic and synthetic language, but English affixes are mostly used to create derivatives (do - doer, relevant - irrelevant) but not to intensify the meaning (Ru: мужчина - мужчинка - мужик - мужичок - мужлан)
You can use words like fellow, dude, lad, gent, chap, geezer, etc
, but still, it adds to the precision of the description (what kind of man) rather than to your own attitude as the speaker (do I think the man is strong, healthy, average, vile, filthy, etc)
2) Repetition: the boy went, the boy said, the boy sat, the boy replied
It looks completely natural until you try to translate this text and start looking for synonyms to eliminate this repetition because otherwise, the mental image of your school language and literature teacher will frown at you
But what other texts are known for their merciless repetition
Law-related texts, contracts, specifications, and all of them also are known for their precision and informativeness rather than mood
I agree with this:
>English is very well known for its wealth of synonyms expressing certain nuances and collocations
One can use English the way J. Joice and T. Pratchett used it, and yet it often has the tendency towards informativity over form and the author's attitude
Romania is one of our least mentioned neighbors, along with Hungary, Slovakia, and Moldova
People along the West-Southern border must be more in contact with them/you, but, meeting a person from Central Ukraine, you can form their entire opinion about Romania and Romanians, because on average they don't have any
I've heard some associations with Gypsies; maybe it had happened before I started frequenting AskEurope, too, but since I got more aware of the Gypsy stereotype it's been mentioned 2 times by older people (60+)
My dad was passing through Romania on a train in the 80s; he says, the country looked extremely rural, like, pigs walking in the streets rural, but (his words) *I didn't get off the train; Ukraine also has many underdeveloped patches; apparently they're doing much better now, can't tell since I've never been there since they've joined the EU
This language sounds as difficult as Hungarian
better go to Poland or Czechia to find a job instead
As imperialists with weird language that want our land
Kinda civilized gypsies
(FYI It's not my opinion, I just retranslate the stereotype about Romania in our society
Well, I can give an example that I have met recently
Bukovyna is divided between our countries, right
Ours is the northern part of the region
So, you can read the comments here:
Like that one:
Yep, Russians also said they are a brother nation with Ukraine
I'm from Bila Tserkva, which used to be owned by Polish noble family of Branytskyi
They build quite a few things, more notably a catholic cathedral, and orthodox one, winter palace, and most notably Alexandria (which used to be their actuall estate) which is a huge and awesome park today
Well
They kinda are so it's understandable
Actually no
The white church that the city was named after existed during the times of Kievan Rus and was destroyed by the mongols
Since the south of our country is Crimea, nearly 40 million people would find themselves on the small peninsula which is horrendous and fascinating at the same time
Guess the Russians would be surprised
When you're in nature, the norms are slightly different for both genders
Go off the path as far as you're comfortable and make sure to face away from the group of people that you're with
The people in their turn also can look away for a minute, it's all good
Although, the way you phrased it, men urinating *in public* are perceived as deplorable
Nobody wants to see someone fumbling with their genitals or hear the sounds
They're often drunk and dgaf, so it adds to the impression
Quality of roads, mostly
Lol, we do it the same way, and i thought everybody else does this to
> 15-25 min at the time,
Uh, this is NOT a good advice for someone who has never been to a 120C sauna before
/u/simonbleu pay close attention to how you're feeling, I would restrict the uninterrupted period of being in the hot room itself to not more than 4-6 minutes depending on heart health and body fat (less body fat, less time)
>"the clock is ticking"
that probably another common thing in every post-soviet country
I wish we had more cute old wooden balconies like in Georgia
Ukraine also has single pot pension system
Result is that it's critically underfunded and gets additional dotation from national budget each year
The devil in the details, as always
My Carcano from 1917 was built there
Our current president's electorate consisted mostly of this people
Seems like a road where you'd need to back in your car until you and the car coming at you are able to pass each other
I mean, you or the other car - whichever is closer to an intersection/etc
But if there's a grass strip or sidewalk, the cars just push to the sides until they both fit the width of the road
As for the speed limit, I guess, people here aren't used to roads that are 1 car wide strictly, unless it's an apartment block driveway or a quiet village road that is also used for walking and cycling, so drivers instinctively slow down to 20-30 km/h.

There's even a part of a line in the city center
December is pretty depressing, in January it starts to become better and better
Our state in the XVII century appeared because a Polish court denied one nobleman justice
The son of Bohdan Khmelnitsky turned out to be such a total insignificance that he ended up in a monastery, from where he was dragged out by the Turkish invaders
A normal son, by the way, died in Moldavia
We give you our wheat fields
Yall forgeting you need good agriculture to not be dependent on america and usdia for it
*"Яжемать/yazhemat'"* in Russian (means "but-I'm-a-mother") - a woman that validates every stupid action and opinion by her being a mother
Haven't met a *"яжеотец/yazheotets"* (but-I'm-a-father) yet
Derogatory addressing to a snotty kid is a snot, a pee-er (the one who's peeing in their pants), a shitter (the one who's solved Fermat's theorem, obviously)
Let's use the new word in a sentence:
* "but-I'm-a-mother, I know what's better for my child"
* "but-I'm-a-mother, I don't feel like letting my son/daughter wasting their life away with that partner they've chosen"
* "but-I'm-a-mother, I can't just sit and wait here"
* "but-I'm-a-mother, so I'm a more complete woman than those other non-mothers"
This is a broader term that includes but isn't limited by entitlement or helicopter-parenting
Maybe it's being used in more civil situations like "but-I'm-a-father, I feel for these kids" or "but-I'm-a-father, my opinion should be respected".
It's probably not universally known here, but when you learn to skydive and you need to count several seconds, you are taught to do this like 501, 502, 503
For me (Ukrainian ) it's chocolate and other sweets
I didn't know that our sweets are so delicious till I started travelling around the EU Everything's amazing there, except sweets
Even Toblerone dosen't taste so good
It's probably too late to write but salo with chocolate, I don't think anyone has it but Ukraine
Hahaaha
I know sounds gross or weird but it's good though
So if you're gonna travel to Lviv, you have to try it :)
Here [some] [photos]
Our autonomous region, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, is temporarily occupied by Russian Federation
By the law it has politically, has its own legislative ( Supreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea) and executive ( Council of Ministers of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea  ) branches of government
Can't say it's fully economically autonomous, but the budget of AR Crimea is present in the budget system of Ukraine as a separate branch
There were some talks in our politics that Crimea also should be cultural autonomy of Crimean Tatars after the de-occupation, but I doubt that will become possible even when the peninsula will be free
Main problem - it is not like there is a union about this question between politics
Kyiv city also has somewhat special legal status, e.g. it doesn't report to a governor
It wouldn't affect, but maybe we would be able to ask someone about was it really French spies who [burned half of Kyiv in 1811]
No, we only have dumplings with meat (it's a traditional dish), and I've never seen fruit-filled dumplings in any vegetarian cafes here either
But I'll make sure to try them next time I travel to Austria, they sound good
Edit: As some people said here, pelmeni (dumplings) ≠ vareniki
To find out their differences and more, read replies to this comment below
That could be a confusing topic though, as this is specific to our culture, so no worries:)
From a Ukrainian perspective, ***pelmeni*** and ***varenyky*** both belong to the family of dishes, which take small portions of dough and fill them with something, then boil in water with salt (+optional spices)
However, they're quite different
**Pelmeni** is a sturdy, calorific food
The dough is traditionally made with flour, water, egg and some plant oil
The filling is meat with onions, salt and pepper
The dish was apparently adopted to Siberia from Mongolia/China
So imagine working families that make tons of *pelmeni* to maintain their calorific intake in a relatively cold climate
**Varenyky** are both food and dessert
The dough is traditionally made with flour, milk whey/sour milk, egg, salt, baking soda (to make the dough grow)
The filling is whatever people want
* If it's the main calorific dish, the filling is usually meat, roasted bacon, egg, potato, stewed cabbage (separately or somehow combined)
These are usually served with plant oil+roasted onions (+roasted bacon again, optionally)
* Varenyky with the cottage cheese are in the category of their own
They can be salty or sweet and are usually served with sour cream
* Last but not least, sweet varenyky filled with seasonal fruits: cherry, red/black currant, plums/apricots, etc
These are served with sour cream or honey
Varenyky with cherries are the most prominent in Ukrainian cuisine, along with varenyky with cottage cheese and varenyky with fried bacon
I'll go to one of the 24 hour supermarkets
I won't even be the most drunk
Another option - return to the bar and order some food
Almost all the bars here have a choice of dishes
Or 24h McDonalds for cheap, filling and not messy food
People in my city ride either MTBs or road racers
I have both, but I use the road racer more
I'm not european
For me, raw meat is a no-no (that includes any meat - mammals, birds, fish
I just cannot wrap my head around uncooked meat
But what's wrong with talking with your dog
How else are you gonna communicate with it
I eat hot-smoked
They said as if it was strange and unusual, for me it seems like the most natural thing to do
Yeah, first tried, then realized sushi is where they put raw fish
Don't try it anymore:) It's not that I was sick, just my mind reads it as non-edible
> What are they like
Quite
> How are the radiation levels
There are hotspots in Prypiat, but if you with a guide you will avoid it and route are pretty safe
Wouldn't recommend going to the Zone illegal, first - you can be arrested, second - radiation poisiong even in small scales isn't a joke
> Are there wildlife and trees growing
Yes, wildlife is flourishing without humans there - wolves, Przewalski’s horses, brown bears European bisons e.t.c.
In Prypiat trees are everywhere
>I remember hearing something about another accident recently
Wildfires, a good piece of Red Forrest are burned to the ground and fire was close to Prypiat . And as some sources claims fires were very close to the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel
Wildfires happen time to time, but this was one of the biggest
Probably some idiots from a nearby areas (from Zhytomyr Oblast for example) wanted to burn their fields before planting season and lost control of fire
That becomes a common problem
I haven't been there myself but wanted to add a few spots on google street view:
* [within Prypyat'] - poplar, acacia, and pine trees everywhere - exactly as it should be in northern Ukraine
* [the nature nearby]
Oooff, from 1991
• Many early historic states which existed on our land, but I can't call it "country" for example [Antes State] 4th-7th century
• 882-1240 (Rus)
• 1253–1349 (Kingdom of Ruthenia)
• 1648 - 1653 (Khmelnytsky Uprising against Rzeczpospolita)
• 1708 - 1709 (Mazepa Uprising against Russian Empire)
• 1918 - 1921 (UPR, Ukrainian State, Directorate of Ukraine, WUPR)
• 1991 -
PS: technically we can count also time when we were part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Вели́ке кня́зівство Лито́вське, Руське, Жемайтське та інших земель) and later part of Polish Lithuanian Union (Rzeczpospolita)
Because Ukrainian lands become part of this country not as result of conquest etc but because of Dynastic union, and we still had right of voting and so on
Don't forget about 1917-1921
The Byzantine Empire seems very much an independent Greek state though, there was not much Roman left in it by 500 AD or so
It's not a successor to Athens League but the modern Greece is very much a successor of the Byzantine Empire
mhmhmmm
Maybe, so, my mistake
Milan
Literally nothing to see except hundreds of stores and thousands of people going there
Also the Duomo is so-so
I dunno, I kinda like Athens, it's just so enormous and chaotic and cozy at the same time
If you like cities that may be ugly but that are truly alive then you'll be in heaven
Ukrainian Cyrillic transliterates H as **Г**. But don't confuse it with **Г** in other languages that also use Cyrillic
For example, the Russian  **Г** is **Ґ** in Ukrainian (notice the diacritic)
The hard **Ґ** transliterates to G (in English: *gossip, gallery*)
The soft **Г** is breathy and transliterates to H (in English: *happy, house*)
You can listen [here]
Yes in Russian, no in Ukrainian
Cyrillic isn't too different from Latin
Each language that uses Cyrillic has its own phonemes represented by the script
Sometimes the script is modified or enhanced with more characters/diacritics to represent the phonemes better
It shows how each language has its own history where certain characters have changed or fallen out of usage
Not really
Wow, that's fucked up
I've already told about it on Reddit, the name Michael is inseparable with the animal bear in Russian since the diminutive for a bear is "*misha*" and the nickname for "Mikhail" (Michael) is also "Misha".
All fairytale-ish bears are *Mikhail*s, sometimes even *Mikhail Potapovich* (Mikhail, son of Potap), which is a play on words meaning "Bear son of Stomper" or just "stomping bear".
Also, Russian has many loanwords from Ukrainian which don't make sense next to other Russian words of different origins
For example, the Ukrainian word for Sunday is "*неділя/nedilia*" i.e., literally "*the day you do nothing*". In Russian, "*неделя/nedelia*" means "week/7 days", and Sunday in Russian is "resurrection". Every Sunday is the resurrection day
Another Ukrainian word is "*коло/kolo*" (circle) which is the root for Russian words like "*колесо/kolieso*" (wheel), "*кольцо/koltso*" (ring), "*околица/okolitsa*" (outskirts)
But the Russian word for "circle" itself is "*круг/krug*".
Maybe that one "krug" word is a loanword from Church Slavonic
Historically, Russian has been in contact with Polish, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Church Slavonic (the language of the Bible which linguistically is a South Slavic language)
>circle is ,,kruh"
Is it by chance a geometry term
In Ukrainian, "окружність/o**kruzh**nist" (circumference) is the length of a "*коло/kolo*" (circle) when it's a drawn figure
We also have words like "*кружляти/kruzhliaty*" (to spin, go in circles) and "*кружка/kruzhka*" (a mug)
>proto-Slavic or Old Church Slavonic
But these don't just mean "very old Slavic". The first one is a concept, same as the Proto-Indo-European language
We can speak about shared etymology/roots in both proto-Slavic and Proto-Indo-European, and these are cognates, even if the meanings are opposite
Old Church Slavonic is a dead literature *language* which belongs to the established subgroup of South Slavic languages and has written examples, same as Latin
It's the first language the Bible was translated to; it was brought to Rus along with Christianity, and Rus alredy had an established spoken language at the time
So when we speak about Old Church Slavonic roots, they're borrowings which have become synonymus with the already existed words
In disctionaries, "kolo" is synonymous with "krug", but etymologically there's a slight difference
"Kolo" is something like a wheel or millstone, and "krug" is a ring, something bent to form a circle
From Ukrainian perpective, it makes sense since "krug" is the length of a drawn circle in geometry, as well as circled/concentrated movement, but many other "rounds words" consistently have the "kolo" root, as well as the word "circle" itself
In Russian, "round words" are less consistent, and the word "kolo" is absent
Along with other examples of inconsistent usage like "nedilia", I assume these are borrowings from either Ukrainian (its local linguistic ancestor) or the Bible language which was used as the language of literature
We have at least 3-4 hours of history each week for 6-7 years in middle and high school
I've read here on Reddit that you learn one subject for half a year and then it might never be resumed
If it's true, we just spend more time on it
Imagine learning the history of the country but theres no country
Just the people
I see, thank you for clearing it out for me
>  It was actually comparable with the number of hours of history I had during my 4 years of high school in Poland
An American redditor explained this concept to me once
But it still feels like we need more hours to learn the whole Ukrainian History from the earliest people/civilizations to the 2000s and World History that includes the earliest civilisations (Sumer, Egypt, China, Greece), Asia, the Americas, each European country individually and during some significant events
If you don't mind answering, do you also have two different subjects or is it one holistic World History curriculum
I was 15 when ended school and 16 when joined university because I had a birthday after I signed documents with my uni
Commonly, it's 16-18 years when finishing school and joins the university, some may join later because we have mandatory military service .
When I studied we had 11 year school and we finished in most at the 17 years but Ukraine introduce 12 year school so students finish it at the 18
Kyiv is named after its legendary founder Kyi
Together with his brothers Schek and Khoryv and sister Lybid' he founded a settlement here

We know that aliens mostly like to attack only US and pretend like there are no other countries in the world
Car chase - our roads are made to prevent speed chases or that will be shortest car chase scene ever
High speed police chases
Ukrainian police has Toyota Prius as its main car
Or movies about good cops;)
And if you're under 14 you have to go to the next nearest
Yes, that why i say -  mostly
Yeah, they are being gifted by Japanese government
It has something to do with the Kyoto protocol
Also, they gifted Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV
Also, Ukrainian police uses Skoda Octavia and Skoda Rapid
Bonus points for going in full school uniform
That shows you are responsible  citizen, so won't drink to death
Did you ally with emus
It is possible but it probably won't amount to much
People with really thick Ukrainian dialects generally don't know the standard version of our language or at the least struggle to speak it, while they have no problems with writing it
So if you go somewhere high in the Carpathians, you'd have to make due with the least intelligible version of Ukrainian language possible (it sounds interesting though)
But while the more rural folks have their thick dialects, generally in oblasts' centres, people speak either the standard dialect, surzhyk and sometimes Russian
We have some differences between how we say things in the East and the West but generally you can't distinguish them unless you're a native speaker
As for people speaking surzhyk, it's best to avoid them, they're not really the best at oratory and you probably won't get much out of discussing something with them
>As for people speaking surzhyk, it's best to avoid them, they're not really the best at oratory and you probably won't get much out of discussing something with them
Quite a sweeping statement
I'm fine with different currency as long as everywhere my domestic card is accepted
"*Вареники/varenyky*" that can have any filling and several types of dough
The dough is usually soft and airy, but if you make *varenyky* with meat or other non-sweet fillings, you can make the dough flat and simple, like for *pelmeni*.
In the traditional Ukrainian cuisine, there are *varenyky*:
* with [potato and onions]
* with cabbage and/or mushrooms;
* with [sour cherry] and other fruits like plums or redcurrant (are served with sour cream or honey);
* with [quark] (sweet or salted) and sour cream;
* with [liver]
* with [roasted becon]
Vareniki, come with everything possible inside, but my favorite are with cherry
Lol, I didn't know that the word 'quark' also means cottage cheese
My only association with this word was physics
It reminds me of [this] I've never worked with this software, just remember the name
Смачного! (i.e., enjoy your meal)
I love every filling, but sweetened quark/cottage cheese is on top, along with potato+onions
Oh, here we go again
In Europe it's Italy, because I love their food, history, landscapes
From the rest of the world it's Japan, but i don't know why, I don't like anime or Japanese food, but I'm in big love with Japan
Tricky question for a Ukrainian
Viktor Yanukovich, I guess
I mean, he stole tens of billions of dollars from Ukraine, that's not just crime, that's an outstanding level of theft
Yanukovich
Timing is key
He stole money as he was fleeing to Russia in 2014, during protests that wanted him out
Sort of like a cover up
all Italian ordinary people I've met were very kind and cool, though
but Salvini, I hate him more than pineapple pizza
In my childhood we had this variation with a well instead of a rock
Now it seems to be completely gone
> 325€
This amount looks like average Ukrainian wage
At least, the official ones
It's very broad question and answer is different for different people
My region and social circle is very anti-communist for example, but every single person I talked to that was officer in USSR said that they miss it greatly
Imagine that you're a young engineer in the Soviet Union, just graduate after university and have your first job
You feel that your knowledge can help your Motherland to become a greatest communist country in the world
Then  you anderstand that all you have to do is just sit on your chair from 9 am to 6 am and do nothing just pretend that you do something
Money you'll get anyway
The only time when you work hard is when they send you and your comrades to a kolkhoz to help village people to harvest potatoes
Because all youth from villages fleed to cities for the best
So actually not that bad but this system can't last too long and in 1991 collapsed
And guys who worked from 9 to 6 suddenly understood that their knowledge of how to do nothing is irrelevant in real world
So they began to worship the ol' good days
I was like, a channel called *ushanka* show
Must be some Soviet nostalgia/interest milking channel
So I clicked the link and found [this particular video] on relationships between Ukrainians and Russians in the 1980s, but it has a lot of additional information to set the background for anyone inquiring about the life prior to the dissolution

EU, black color on the flag, Flanders that refused their own language for Dutch, Waloons that refused their own language for French, chocolate, dark chocolate
EU,chocolate,Hercule Poirot,always without government
What's about Walloon and Flemish
I know, as it would be weird for Belgium to kinda "survive" as functioning state without something like this
It's just Belgium users love to talk about that and first time I heard it, it struck me so much that I remember it to this day, so I decided to include this
> These are regions where they speak these languages
Sorry, what
Ok, you decided not to create your own literary standard
What's about Walloon
It has its own literary standard
Also:
>Legally, Walloon has been recognized since 1990 by the French Community of Belgium, the cultural authority of Wallonia, as an "indigenous regional language" which must be studied in schools and encouraged

I asked the landlord in April to install the AC for the summer, since I was sure that due to Covid I would have to work from home
This summer, the AC was the real MVP
It was definitely worth to ask for AC
Titushky - young people (athletes, gopninks e.t.c) that blending into a peaceful crowd or mob and then instigating a violent  fight between them which always lead to arrests of peaceful protesters  on the grounds of mass disorder; perpetrators were then used either as  "witnesses" of the committed "crime" or as "victims".

How late is night
Before midnight you'd be safe in streets especially busy ones
3-4 am I would avoid many regions
The downtown is safe enough
A lot of sketchy areas you can be robbed, some areas where addicts choose to hang out
Wouldn't recommend it in general
The center and tourist spots may be relatively safe, but everything further from it, especially, sleeping blocks aren't 100% safe, and find troubles for your fifth spot may be very easy

One of the travel bloggers from Ukraine forgot his camera on your loop road somewhere in the wild and returned after he drove a couple of hours
Thr camera was not there
The police literally found him later calling to his hostel and returned the camera - someone picked it up and brought to the police
Not sure if people understand that fifth spot is ass

It's normal in Ukraine and, as far as I know, in other Slavic countries too
For a Ukrainian, it's not obvious, actually
I assume you hint on her since Spaniards are touchy-feely, but Ukrainians aren't northerners in this regard, too, especially women
On the other hand, I start to wonder how much is your *too much* then
I've no idea about this "lover hierarchy", besides, Slavic people are different within themselves
Ukrainians tend to be affectionate with family and friends, more so in relationships
On the second though, our women love to tease in a relationship accentuating how the man is crazy about them and all, so I imagine a Ukrainian wife dropping something like "c'mon, stop kissing me for just a bit, I'm not an ice cream".
Sounds weird
That Europe = Western Europe
Waiting for Hungarians to remind us that there's a thing called Central Europe
I totally can understand those who don't want to be associated with "East Europe" but forcing the idea of "Central Europe" looks too artificial to me
This division East-West is rather historical than geographical
What happens in Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch stays in Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
But now it's rather a way to distantiate yourself from "filthy easterners"
I understand why you like to think this way
But most of the people don't go that deep and use just East-West
UPD
By the way, unlike Central Europe, V-4 is a term which is used in real life and has its point
Pretty popular term in news and analitics
At least in Europe
In Kyiv, you can get a 250m2 luxury flat in the city center, 13 normal size (40-50m2) flats outside of the city center, 400-700m2 house with a garden (overall 2000m2 land)
You can buy around 10 flats in middle sized cities and rent them out 150-200 dollars each, and not worry about money anymore
Holly shit, where is it
It's basically a village
At least for me, the room is anything that is not toilet/bath/kitchen/balcony/corridor
You can use a room for home office, playing room for children, living room, etc, that's why I don't call it a bedroom
LMAO we are just multulingual
Edit: yeah, most people here including me know more than two languages, sorry
In Ukraine the first floor is the one at street level
Black Square, lol

Elon please stop lol
all the damn soviet names we got rid of (expect in crimea)
there are a lot of small towns and villages across Ukraine, Belarus and Russia called [Городок] which translates as "small town" and even more [Городище] "town"
oldest bridge in Paris is called ["New bridge"]
[Old New Year] is also a thing
Bosnian [Bosanska Artiljerija] and Estonian [Metsavendade laul] are my favorites
I also absolutely love American Civil War songs like " I wish I was in Dixie" or "Battle hymn of the republic"
The Cadets Of Guard School is a great song from the Russian empire (vyatka super for any TNO players)
it is not played on the radio in my country, therefore I heard this song this year
it is, indeed, brilliant
Chicken Kiev
It used to be a popular restaurant dish in Soviet times, but no one cooked it at home
You can find it in the frozen section in the supermarket, but it's just one brand that makes it I don't think very many people my age (late thirties) or younger ever buy it
And when going out, Ukrainians clearly prefer Asian, Italian or Georgian cuisine over Ukrainian
We eat a fair amount of sauerkraut in Ukraine, but it's always white cabbage (often with some carrot) and we don't ever cook it
I do love German cooked red sauerkraut and buy a can of the ready made one in the supermarket as soon as I get there )))
I guess cafeterias here would have it as well
Well, I don't think anyone doesn't know anything
Where we're going, we don't need infrastructure
If there is any way that a public work can be botched, half-assed, or cost-slashed by giving it to inadequate, uncaring, or usually straight corrupt contractors, it will be done in the most atrocious way possible
By any West European standard, 90% of our sidewalks (mostly considered perfectly walkable by locals) are basically a pile of asphalt thrown into the mud and leveled a bit
Worse than that, common attitude to any problem related to public property is apathetic
Nobody on the street will support you if you yell at an asshole who parked on a sidewalk, etc
There's a lot of people who told me they would like to move here for perceived low CoL but I think they underestimate the amount of shit they take for granted in their lives and how the absense of it will get on their nerves here
fuck everyone knows
low wages

Sweden is 6th in that list for rapes
WTF
Ukraine's climate is continental, i.e. +25-33C in summer and 0C and below in winter
Right now it's -8C. We rarely experience -20C, but it happens at least once every winter (except for the last winter)
So when we have those really cold days, it depends on humidity
-20C + dry air = refreshing
The cold winter sun is out
Freezing cold water feels warm
Your phone doesn't react to the touch each time, but it's not like it reacts each time when it's warmer
-7C and high humidity = unpleasant; the cold is crawling under your clothes
It's usually windier, too
That's the secret behind living in much colder climates - low humidity
In general, everything works as usual when it's really cold
Obviously, some cars parked outside don't start at first; you need to warm the car first
But when it comes to public transport, heavy snowfalls is what creates extra traffic, not the cold
When I went to school, we had days off when the temperature dropped to -20C. I'm not sure what's going on now, especially during the pandemic
I guess each school decides if they have the means to heat the building
When it's cold, it's especially nice to get into a store or a cafe and buy some coffee or tea
It helps to stay warm
We have those [hot beverage kiosks] in public places
Some of them are mobile
There are also coffee/tea vending machines everywhere
People can buy a hot drink everywhere, at a bus stop, in a park, in supermarkets, in stores that sell electronics and other non-edible stuff
As for your question about phones and gloves, I've come to appreciate half-mittens, when only the tips of my fingers are not covered with the mittens
When I don't handle the phone, I put my hands into the pockets, and that's it
Balkans is  Southeast , still, they are honorary Eastern Europe
Personally, I just start with "Я вас слухаю" / I'm listening

Happy Independence Day
Drywall is only used in office buildings here
I can't imagine someone using it in a house
We either rent a van (usually comes with a driver) or just load the item inside (or onto the roof railings) our car, if it's a station wagon or an SUV with enough space
We order the items with delivery
Pick-up trucks are almost non-existent
Most of the places that sell such things, offer delivery and movers
If not, there are a lot of options to hire
Delivery
It's either a moving service where you're able to pick the size/model of the vehicle and rent it hourly or a postal/delivery service that works as an intermediate between the seller and the buyer
Moving services are usually available in bigger places
You call them, specify the size of your load, book a vehicle, specify if you need people to help move the object, and that's it
Essentially, you use them as a borrowed truck
When you order something from a business, whatever the size of the object is, it's always possible that they'll deliver it themselves
Sometimes even for free to attract customers
Or they arrange the delivery via one of the usual postal/delivery services that work across the country
Those services can deliver whatever you need - wardrobes, couches, cinder blocks, wooden logs, but the bigger is the object, the higher is the price
The more remote/obscure your location is, the fewer opportunities you have, so people from villages usually have three options: fit the thing in/on your own car, ask a relative/neighbour with a minibus, or order through the aforementioned postal service
Well, Americans still call big cars "trucks" for some reason
Same goes for us
Yes, we did a little bit of cooking I'd say
Nothing too complicated but not that easy
I remember, we did some salads and thin pancakes,maybe some kind of other desserts too
A very small % of the names often used in the Slavic speaking countries are local (i.e., derived from words in the Slavic languages)
The majority are of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew (Biblical) origin
Actual Slavic names are:
* Liudmyla (liked by people);
* Sviatoslav (the one who glorifies holiness);
* Volodymyr (the one who owns/rules the world)
Stems like *-slav* *-slava* (glory) and -myr (world) are parts of many compound Slavic names
There're also other names that were calqued from yet again Greek or Latin, for example:
* Svetlana (literally "she-light"; a translation of the Greek name Fotina);
* Bogdan (literally "the one given by God", which is a translation of the name Theodor, which, yet again, has local cognates Fedir (Ukrainian) and Fiodor (Russian)
Excuse this wordy reply, it's not 100% directed at you
It's just that many people pick a name that they associate with Slavic countries, call it "a Russian name", and this name is often of Greek/etc origin; some Byzantine emperor or a Biblical martyr had that name
Great to know it was interesting to you
Yes, since Olha and Oleh were names of Kyivan rulers of Varangian (northern incomers from the Baltic area) descent, those names feel very local, so it took me a minute to realize they're not, too
It's like realizing why someone named Marshall Mathers would call himself Eminem
BTW, Olha's son was named Sviatoslav, and her grandson was Volodymyr the Great who adopted Christianity
We gave up 3rd largest nuclear arsenal, basically for nothing
Yes, USA, UK and Russia have guarantees to preserve Ukrainian sovereignty and territory
But , without mechanism of realization of "guarantees " as 2014 year showed
I don't really think most people know enough about us to have any real stereotypes
That's a good one
I distinctly remember seeing a lot of them ten years ago, but haven't seen a single one lately
Don't you have stereotype about rich dudes
cheap accommodation, tasty food, gorgeous women, shitty roads, grumpy people on the streets (very friendly if you talk to them, though)
While it is one of the poorest area in Europe, it's not *that* bad
We still very well of compared to the rest of world, and we are trying to improve
Hey
What about Moldova
large cities are indistinguishable from average European city (except abundance of ads I think)
the countryside, though, is ХІХ century without food scarcity
I don't like it
*files resignation from citizenship*
Героям Слава) It mostly is
We don't eat it everyday, but you will sure see it quite often (especially when drinking)
Lies, almost everyone I know eats salo
Not everyday of course, but it's standard thing to see at holiday tables and as закуска during parties
Petrol may be cheap compared to EU prices, but for locals it's pretty damn expensive
It costs something like 1€/l, while average salary in Ukraine is a bit more than 300€ per month
There are many relatively new cards now, but a lot of Soviet ones too
That's was our stereotype about Russians in 90s
Track suits yes, everything else - ahem, what
That's out stereotype of georgians/azerbaijanis/armenians
>instead of wheat they have wine
And whine
I'm watching right now as well

Many people on the West don't realize that Soviet Union is equal to Nazi Germany in its anti-human acts
You probably comparing discrimination policies with genocide
While discrimination is far from good, **killing** millions of civil people just for them being Jews/Ukrainians is far, far worse
\> Had it been under nazi rule for another 10 years it would be empty space populated by ethnic Germans
They haven't finished with Ukrainians and other closer nationals to move to recently gained Poland
Moreover, it wasn't about "saving" Europe but conquering Europe, which we can even observe from Eastern Bloc
What's your measurement of evil
If Nazi genocided millions of people and Sovok genocided millions of people, they are equally bad
No matter what's the quantity of those millions
I heat my house in village with wood when it's cold outside, my neighbours do same , so probably this is typical situation for ukrainian village or even small towns
i dont remember anyone saying Kievan Rus did something wrong expect collapse
Same

Once upon a time in Odesa, I was called a nationalist just for speaking Ukrainian in Ukraine
>That we actually let people from Sweden work in Copenhagen
Each joke has a piece of truth :) Could you add more details in it
Why
It is a superiority of some English speaking people assuming everyone should know and speak English
Same for Russian, I feel your pain
But actually real retards in stories like these are those people
Because usually they know only one language (English/Russian)
Who cares
Just imagine that people call you nazi for you using Polish in some Polish city, that was
Idk, German for instance

Also, hate vodka and everything stronger than wine

Not very fond of them (gasps follow)
Yeah, it's funny, it's kind of a popular sentiment here, but no one really noticed around us, lol
In post soviet state . porns sometimes are referred as  "German movies"
what does it mean exactly
Is it about invading Poland or is it about running away to Poland, how we use the phrase "I have time to make it to the Finnish border" in the sense "i'm doing something weird or dangerous but its gonna be ok/i still have time to get away"?
Same here
What do your laws say about bike helmets

Real anti corruption initiatives that will have a result, an adequate and competent government that really care about citizens, but not only about the interest of oligarchs
Doritos and decent roads
Everyone has a patronymic, i.e., the name of their father after their first name
Grammatically patronymics are similar to the handmades' nicknames from the TV show - of-Ivan, of-Viktor, of-Serhiy, etc
So daughters of some man named Oleksandr are Daryna Oleksandrivna (of-Oleksandr, feminine form), Olena Oleksandrivna, etc
And his sons are Dmytro Oleksandrovych (of-Oleksandr, male form), Yevhen Oleksandrovych, etc
Then there's also a family name, Ivan Oleksandrovych **Moroz**.
Some patronymics have become family names, so there're surnames like Oleksandrovych, Oleksandriv, etc
Patronymics are widely used to address older people, people in power, or just people in a formal setting
So, your friend's parent may be auntie Tania to you, but their grandparent is usually addressed using their Name+Patronymic
Also, teachers are addressed by their Name+Patronymic without exception
Elderly people often call each other using patronymics only, e.g., *good morning, Oleksandrivna* (literally, a daughter of Oleksandr, of-Oleksandr), *did you see the concert on TV last night
It's their thing; maybe because when older people meet later in life, they start with addressing each other by Name+Patronymic and then just shorten it for convenience without going too informal and juvenile
We have patronimical names
In Ukrainian, similar to Western Slavic languages, we have a formal addressing "pan/pani" (male/female)
Unlike, e.g., Polish, we don't use it casually, but it is possible to address someone as *"pani Olga"* instead of *"Olga Fedorivna"*.
*"Pan Yakovenko"* (*Yakovenko* being a common surname) is also a valid addressing, but more when people in a proper setting talk about someone who's absent
For example, someone is being interviewed on TV, and they mention some other person as *"Pan Yakovenko has said
"*.
I guess, since "pan/pani" literally means *"lord/madam"* or *"someone who owns land and rules over smaller people"* (not an official title though, just an addressing), it was perceived as bourgeois in the Soviet times, and the Name+Patronymic addressing (or just *"tovarisch* (literally, *comrade*) *Petrov/Petrova"*) became the most prevalent and usual in our documents, workspace, education, etc
*Tovarisches* vanished simultaneously with the USSR, though
In Ukraine, the tradition for *"pan/pani"* is more common in the west which is closer to Central European Slavic-speaking countries
In Russian, it is possible to address someone as *"gospodin/gospozha"* (petty much the same meaning - *"lord/madam"*), but it's only used in two settings: in their parliament and in BDSM
> What if you don’t know the persons patronymic name
When you don't know but think it would be really inappropriate or awkward to not use it, you just say: *excuse me, may I know your patronymic/full name
* And after that, they just say their Name+Patronymic or wave their hand saying it's fine to just use their name
> She would never be addressed using the last name
It sounds like someone is putting themselves in a position superior to her, and not in a respectful way
I personally like [this evil building] (IQ Business Center, Kyiv)
Looming [like a creep]
Peeking from behind the corner [like a psycho]

Thank you, come to the dark side
Since you have the Ukrainian flair among others, I only assume you've seen [this] It's called "Mavka
The Forest Song". They've been cooking it for nearly 4 years now, with no palpable results aside for their [PR campaign] I'm still not sure about this project, we'll see
The first trailer came up right after Frozen, and Mavka had the same "frog eyes small mouth" design as Anna, Elsa, and Rapunzel, so there was come comparison to Disney
AFAIK, Mavka was redesigned to [this] and [this]
Another option for a Ukrainian princess is Anna of Kyiv, Yaroslav the Wise's daughter
Or Roxolana (aka Hurrem Sultan)
But both stories are not for children
Great Patriotic War is a bit of a mistranslation
The closest word-to-word would be Great Fatherland War or somrthing like that
And it's only the eastern front 1941-1945
That and WW2 are separate concepts
It is definitely usually translated as Great Patriotic War
That's what English Wikipedia says
I just wanted to clarify that it's not an accurate translation, although the most common one
It's a direct translation of the Russian name and they're really close languages
My native language is actually Russian
We have almost full year on 20th century and WW2 is a big part of it
It's also covered a bit before that
Narrative depends on the teacher and it's moved a bit lately for obvious reasons
Decommunisation and all
Eastern front is the main topic of course, down to operations, big battles and all of that
What do you mean by the opposite side
That's true that since 1990-ies the cockroaches almost extinct
Local urban legends used to say that it's because of cellphones and microwave ovens, which is silly because those bastards are extremely radiation-proof
&#x200B;
In reality, they started to extinct when modern repellents became available
In Soviet times the most commons anti-cockroach thing was DIY mix of egg yolk and boric acid
But in the end, insects adapted and either ignored or just ate them
But modern poisons, which destroy their reproduction cycle or taint one insect and kill the whole nest had really change the game
I lived in a dorm with cockroaches
I had a microwave in my room and, occasionally, when I would heat up some food there, a cockroach would somehow crawl into the microwave, while it's working, and explode
> Insects in general are fairly resistant to radiation, but cockroaches are not
The more you live the more you learn
> This is not to say that the existance of microwave ovens and cell phones has anything to do with cockroach population
Anyway, in my hometown they started to extinct long before cellphones and microwaves became common
I dunno, started learning Polish on Duolingo
Is it a new stereotype for Ukrainians - to move to Poland
*Ф Шчебжешинє хшонж бжмі ф тшчінє*, am I doing any good
Ate borszcz with salo, love it
Indeed, indeed - such is life
Yes, after you finish the tree you need some practice with native speakers, and while you're at it, you get a job and a place to live
Хшон**шч**? Хшон**щ**?
According to [this table] szcz=щ, so technically хшон**щ** is correct
But in practice, Ukrainians love to palatalize and pronounce щ either like "shch" or "sch", or even like "sh".
Purely phonetically, I'd rather spell it like хшон**шч** and **Шч**ебжешин.
Not strong, still someone seems this as ok
Personally, I don't. It backfired greatly not so long ago, so I am not sure why we should allow it
We have no and pretty much nobody supports it
With our country, we don't have that much people that may need a second nationality, because, apart from Russians and Polish guys, we're pretty pure nationality-wise
On the other hand, it opens up possibilities and leeways for collosal corruption and schemes and should we allow it, we're going to have our oligarchs suck money out of our state into their pockets, like vampires they are
So yeah, the cons heavily outweigh the benefits for us
So you can get a citizenship just by having relatives born in pre-Trianon Hungary
I am from Transcarpathian region and kinda want hungarian citizenship, I know for a fact that my great grandfather was born in Hungarian Kingdom but he was not hungarian, do I have any chances
Of course, it is
&#x200B;
UPD: Looks like our gov wants to allow dual citizenship "*with EU countries, countries of the world that are friendly to us, that do not pose any threat to us, and the list of these countries (...) will depend on some criteria"* according to our MFA Minister, but *"a number of restrictions on dual citizenship will be imposed on members of parliament, ministers and other officials
Belarus
They definitely can\`t do any harm to anyone except themselves
Don\`t thread on them, from Ukraine with love
Baltic countries
Still, it doesn't save them from endless jokes generated by two puns in English
Well, there is more jokes about Belarus in Ukraine rather than in United Kingdom
And they are friendly
But you know, it's all jokes until *some eastern neigbour* desides that your country is too independent
Me neither
See, no one wants to insult Baltic countries:)
Nah, wait, I know one about estonians being slow
Find it pretty dumb
I find it a bit tactless to shout state secrets on the internets
Why would you mix wine with mineral water
Because it's just watered down wine
Why would you want to water down wine
How do we know
Did you try learning English in duolingo
So how well you learnt English with it
Plenty of them
Besides the spirits of pretty much everything - from forest (Lisovyk) to sauna (Bannyk) we also had werewolves (Vovkulaka), river mermaids (Mavka) and vampires (Upyr)
No articles in both of my native languages
But since articles in many languages show the gender of the word, we have 3 genders and most of the times you can feel what is the new word gender by the look of the word
Counterintuitively however, there are words that are written identically in Russian and Ukrainian but have different genders: собака (a dog) - f in Russian and m in Ukrainian
Also that "feel of gender" lets you down sometimes
I am a geography geek and I was devastated when I learned that Bangladesh is feminine regardless of how it looks
Slavic languages don't have articles so we don't have to think about it
Conjugating words can be a pain though
We have time, gender, number and form to take into account
Feels like masculine
No vowels in the end, no other signs of being feminine
But it is feminine in Ru and Ua, despite being masculine in many other Slavic languages
Earlier I would say "it happened in Bangladesh" as "це відбулося в Бангладеші", but apparently the correct way is "це відбулося в Бангладеш" which still sounds weird to me
In Ukrainian we don't conjugate foreign words mostly and their spelling is just transliterated
This has exceptions of course
For example, in Ukrainian you can form an adjective for any place to indicate a person or thing that came from there or their allegiance to it
So, taking your example, you can make бордоський(bordo|s'kyi s'kyi being the suffix indicating that it's from somewhere and the whole word meaning "from Bordeaux")
This is true only if the object in question is singular and male(male as in the gender of the word), if it's not you change the suffix to ська/s'ka for female singular, to ське/s'ke for neutral and to ські/s'ki for plural
So it is бордоський маляр(a painter from Bordeaux) but бордоське вино(wine from Bordeaux) and бордоські порти(ports of Bordeaux)
And all this wasn't even meant to be in our language initially because we just apply our rules to foreign words by doing that
Also foreign words are retarded because you have to take into account their gender when conjugating the words around them
And to put a cherry on the top of this cake of grammatical madness, the words in our language can shift their meaning within sentences due to additional context, forcing you to switch the way you conjugate them and the words around them
So going back to Bordeaux, "Бордо" as a noun signifying the region in France has neutral gender
Meaning that you conjugate surrounding verbs and adjectives accordingly
Let's take "Бордо розташоване на півдні Франції"(Bordeaux is located in the south of France)
Here "розташоване" is the word "located" conjugated in the present time, neutral gender, singular number and according to it's group of verbs
But should you change the meaning of the word to, say, a nickname of some girl it's gender changes to female so we get " "Бордо" була розташована на першому поверсі цього будинку"("Bordeaux" was located on the first floor of this building)
Now "розташована" is the same word as "розташоване" but of female gender
If people get confused over the words' original gender, this just puts the last nail in the coffin of bullshit peculiarities of our language
In conclusion, our language is bullshit, I can rant on and on about why it's retarded, I love my language and I'm sorry for writing this giant wall of text
I had the same problem for the longest time ever
We like to omit "the", "a", "an" wherever because we don't have them in neither our language or any neighbouring language
You could also notice him omitting "is" or "are" because in Slavic languages it is common to omit the word "be" and it's forms depending on context
Yeah, according to online dictionaries Bangladesh is feminine in Russian and Ukrainian but masculine in Polish and Croatian lol
I have no idea honestly
Happy to oblige
Our language is indeed very interesting and even with my mediocre high school level knowledge of it I can't stop talking about it once I start
Especially since it's pretty uneven and there's some parts where everything is absolutely logical and orderly with few exceptions(like basic conjugation outside of the sentences, word formation, lexicology, phonetics etc) but at the same time there are parts that go absolutely bananas(advanced conjugation, syntax, punctuation, semantics and dialectology) and those that don't have any rules at all
In Ukrainian you are to remember each and every stress of each word there is out there because they have no rules behind them
This is obviously bullshit as modern Ukrainian has 256 thousand words
This is excluding ancient Ukrainian and obscure dialectical words
You can't physically remember them all so even the best philologists make mistakes with stresses sometimes
But I got carried away again, I'm happy enough I was interesting
We’re not russia (most Americans think we’re the same thing) :(
Being trafficked by Czech
It depends on the weather before this particular moment I decide what to wear
After it's been warm (+25 C) and sunny for several days, +15 C doesn't make that much of a difference
You might shiver in short sleeves and shorts, but overall you're fine
Although in spring, when it's usually +13-15 C and sometimes +18, you stick to padded vests or light jackets and sheepishly take them off if you go on a picnic
* Restoring army capability
* Decentralization of goverment  - more money now stay in regions
* e-gov services development (neeed an improvement though)
* solid pro-West course, at least for now
The most important thing as for me is awakening of national spirit and a start of active national identity development
I'd call it overall **national Renaissance**. Ukraine is becoming Ukraine instead of the UkrSSR
In fact, what we have:
- strong Army, initially launched almost from scratch by volunteers
- language quotas, decommunization, decolonization - Ukrainians finally feel we live in Ukraine, not another Russia (tho there's still a lot of work to do)
- I'm not religious, however, I understand the importance of Ukrainian Independent Orthodox church, which got started by the previous gov, the importance for the Ukrainian identity
- liberalization - e.g., finally LGBT parades were processed peacefully, not only in Kyiv, receiving enough support from police, Poroshenko's party was the first to embrace gender quotas
- improvement of economic and cultural ties with the Western world, due to our refusing from degrading Russian partnership and due to visa-free regime with the EU
- infrastructure development, technological development
Agree + I would add:
- overall **national Renaissance**;
- language quotas, decommunization, decolonization;
- tons of new Ukrainian music, books, shows (on YouTube), and other interesting projects
You just don't know our brainwashed naselenie
Yeah, sorry that we exist, Hungary
Can't say since I refused Russian-language content after 2014
For my eye, it's certainly Ukrainian
We consider it ours, Ukrainian and Qirimlar land, with no exceptions
However, we clearly understand it's a conservative shithole with outdated Soviet infrastructure and with mainly pro-Russian inhabitants, so integrating it with Ukraine will be challenging
Major part of content on radio and TV is obliged to be in Ukrainian by law
I understand it's very ridiculous to put quotas on our own language in our own country while other countries put quotas on minority languages - but that's our ridiculous post-colonial situation
There were funny discussions while the quotas were being developed
Owners of radio stations got butthurt because they played low-quality Russian pop music and were fine with that and didn't want to change anything
Their argument was "there would be no Ukrainian artists to play". And you know what
Since quotas took place, numerous great Ukrainian pop-artists were discovered and I can now enjoy high- and middle-quality Ukrainian pop while in Uber, instead of Russian shitty music
And the thing is there's always been great Ukrainian artists, media owners just were lazy or prejudiced against Ukrainian to change anything
I [like Wolski] if it makes it easier for you
>basically breaking internetional treaties about the rights of minorities
The only ridiculous thing is that I was obliged to get education in Russian in Ukraine, not in Ukrainian which is Native to me and the official language
And that's still the case
Who's the minority, really
Every comprehensive person understands that it's our fight with Russianization, not minorities like Hungarians and others
We all are for multiculturalism
However, Hungarians of Ukraine should receive education in the official state's language for their own sake - so they can integrate into society of their country
Thanks
Will do
I hope the situation will change
I really want Belarus be free and based
\> Ukraine no longer does \[protect the rights of minorities\]
Any International court's judgements

Because the buzz of Putin's lover Orban is not an argument at all
I know well that Trianon revanchism is an unofficial mainstream policy of your country, please don't act a fool
Our minorities feel well and are free to preserve their identities
Contitutional Court of Ukraine accepted our school law as Constitutional
However every Ukrainian citizen is obliged to know Ukrainian (surprise
It's not forcing, it's just common sense
And, IMHO, when Hungarians tell us what to do with our citizens, it's just your revanchism about Transcarpathia, which you confirm by telling us to refuse from our territories and citizens
Meanwhile, we aren't imperialist at all and, for example, don't try to make Poles accept Ukrainian as a second official language since there're millions of Ukrainians in Poland
Stepan Bandera he led brave insurgents against Soviet and German Fascist hordes
Not enough
When it comes to youth slang, in Russian:
* Topovyu, top - the best
* Pochilit' - to relax, chill, spend time
* Randomny - random
* Lol is used in everyday spoken language, pronounced as one syllable
* Creepovuy - creepy, scary
I can come up with much more

Is it still a thing in Russia
They still have better condition and lower price than in Ukraine
Pretty everything in government education system
Cause it's just outdated Soviet "education" system, the only difference: the red is (not so skillfully) painted with yellow-blue
However, there are not so bad and quite modern private kindergartens, schools, unis, etc

Not really Europe, but Moroccan oil if just fucking amazing
We went to this restaurant in Fez's Medina and the restaurant was, to be fair, pretty expensive (about 14 EUR for a dish which is very high for Morrocco) but literally everything was so awesome
I remember there were some things made with camel meat and it was bloodu delicious (I'm really bad with remembering names)
Too spicy for him
Red-black nationalist flag in the East, old Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in the West
Kamelåså!
Нахуя дохуя нахуярили? Расхуяривайте нахуй.
Definitely Russia
Annexation of Crimea, war in Donbas,  treating us like we are theirs little brothers, stealing and rewriting our history and much more
The only way to settle things down is deoccupation of Crimea, withdrawal of troops from Donbas and staying out of our politics
Австро-Угорщина \[ Avstro-Uhorshchyna \]
the full name though: Австро-Угорська імперія (Avstro-Ugors`ka imperiya)
I bet not as poor as we are((
Taking neutral position in Trump impeachment
I meen when ever we could fuck up the country so big and powerful
There is no difference if we tell "Oh, Joe Biden's son is using illegal schemes for earning money in Ukraine" or "that orange man, Trump, used his power to get support from foreign country in future elections". It will be fun both ways
As for Kosovo, I think it is a wise stance
Especialy for Spain
I mean, if you fully support every separatist movement in your country it is okay
You can't blame for example, Katalonia, Basks, Andalusia, and whoever for getting their independence if you support separatists in other countries
Number 4 and 5 hurt me almost physically
You are right, but Russia uses the same logic to justify their clams over the Crimea
They say that people of Crimea also fleed from central government that opressed them
Funny thing that Ukrainian government didn't recognise Kosovo and now I understand why
Yeah, everyone does
I've never seen any person here who would keep eggs outside of the fridge
Actually I didn't know you can do this, it's unusual
Never kept them outside fridge, as I always thought they would go bad faster if you store them in the room temperature
Excuse me
Green tea with milk is also a thing, it just needs to be very strongly brewed
We're not really portrayed in the movies (not talking about Chernobyl here), but when we do, there are two general problems:
All of the Ukrainians speak only in russian
Of course, 65-70% of the Ukrainians actually do, which piss me of so much, but there are a big amount of people who speak in the language of the country in which they live
So it would be better if Ukrainian characters speak Ukrainian in movies
We eat only our national food
I learned to ride at 3 years old
At 5 already rode around my neighborhood with my "bike gang". I still use bicycle as my primary vehicle during spring and summer, even though it is dangerous in Ukraine as cycling lanes or roads are almost non-existant here
Yeah
At, like, 5-6 years
I dunno, maybe 5 or 6
Now that I remember it, I was learning to ride in a very remote village where I used to spend summer
I biked all over the country roads all alone at that age, in a mind-numbingly poor and undeveloped late 80's Ukrainian countyside
I’m the most boring gamer in the world
I like games from Quantic Dream and also games such as “Papers, Please” and “This War of Mine”. I would like to see a story driven game set during time of war where the characters are not soldiers, but just ordinary people
That, and also more Cold War themed games
Perhaps a game which tells the story of the Isdal Woman, a 1970 Cold War murder mystery in Norway which was never resolved
Ukraine in 17th century
Poles - "lyahi", Russians - "kacapi, moskali"
>Slavic people
>Tschusch
I've never heard of it
What does it mean
All of historical periods in our history were terrible
XX: UPA
XVII: Cossacks era
XII-XIII: Principality of Halych-Volyn
IX-XI: Kievan Rus
Pretty everything
* Scythia-Sarmatia (though it's not so relevant to Slavs)
* Ruś
* Grand Dutchy of Lithuania, Żemaitia and Ruthenia
* Cossacks and haidamaks within Rzecz Pospolita
* Cossack state Hetmanshchyna, 17-18 c.
* National Rennaisance in 19 c.
* Ukrainian Revolution, Ukrainian People's Republic and Ukrainian State (of hetman Skoropadśky) during 1910's
* Cultural Rennaisance during 1920's in the Ukrainian Soviet Republic
* Struggle of UPA and OUN for Independent Ukraine against both Nazis and Bolsheviks
* Dissidents during Bolshevik's occupation of Ukraine
* Period of political struggle for Independence during perestroika and early 1990's
* First Maidan, of 2004 - pro-democratic massive peaceful protests, called Orange Revolution
* Second Maidan, of 2013-2014 - pro-democratic massive not so peaceful protests, called Revolution of Dignity
* Current Russian-Ukrainian war and struggle against Russian terrorism
And it's totally fine to romaticize, I believe
Myths are a fundament of reality as we feel it as human beings
And national myths are a source of national strength
Moreover, a major part of our history is indeed a tough struggle for own freedom, against tyranny and anti-human movements
I'm proud
Wouldn't say so
Intermarum when
You are talking about events, not periods
And many of those events took place during the worst periods of our history
Oh, all of them were very interesting
We have many exciting things in our history
Just for regular people life was almost always pretty bad
Anything that ties Ukraine to the general European cultural space is usually seen as a good thing
I like to tell both local and foreigners the fascinating tale of how the Prince of Kyiv basically had relatives on both sides of the Battle of Stamford Bridge
(Google Gytha of Wessex and Elisiv of Kiev)
They/we used to like Norse culture a lot so nobody complaining
We even have an ancient Slavic word for that (Varyagy, [ that described mercenaries from the Baltic Sea
A lot of nationalists are proud of that posterity
Well, I would argue that I have listed solely events
And bad period doesn't mean we don't romanticize the struggle during the given period
Sorry, this is my shitty English
They still like it
Ducks, goose are pretty common
Quails are rare
Pigeons are not consumed at all
We also call asian style cooked duck a Beijing style duck and this is considered a delicatessen
Poultry is pretty big in my part of the country as higher summer temps mean that other meat types are too prone to spoilage, so 90% of the time meat = poultry
I also grew up in the countryside so had more access to different types of poultry than an average city dweller
Here some of the types that are more or less accepted on the table there, other than chicken:
* **duck**: smell funky when raw, but really amazing slow-roasted
* **goose**: a bit on the chewy side, not my favourite
* **pheasant**: basically gamey chicken, great on the grill
* **quail**: mostly grown for eggs, but tapaka style flat quail is top
* **pigeons**: pretty good in stew, not the city rat variety, of course
* **ostrich**: tastes beefy to me, works well done kebab-style
* **guineafowl**: really great bird to keep, yet absent on the mass market
* **turkey**: surprisingly it's only gaining popularity now as it's perceived as a *healthy* option
If you're really adventurous, you can *probably* go with a seagull, but that's already seafood territory IMO and that's a separate thread
Quails are way more common than ducks and geese in supermarkets though
in countryside ducks and geese are more common depending whether particular household has access to pond/river or grass field
in cities I would say it is not really common
agree with quail, it's way more common than duck IMO
just like ducks and geese, pigeons are way more acceptable in the countryside as no sane person would love a fried city rat
source: am from countryside, farmed poultry
In my family it’s more like special occasion dish, but it’s sold in pretty much every supermarket
From the non-occopied part - Kharkiv by far
They wanna lie to you how they got the best parks - it's complete BS and it has nothing but run down brutalist architecture
I'm a non-native speaker and I find Scottish accent to be much easier to understand than those incipherable English ones
IMO Scottish has very distinct pronunciation of many consonants that helps the Slavic ear a lot, whereas English accents often just mangle words to oblivion
Also there is a site called "Scottish English language corpus" with subtitled recordings of people speaking that helped me immensely to learn listening comprehension
It's because in Russian language the word "Родина" (motherland) is feminine
>the word "Родина" (motherland) is feminine
So what
It's translated "kin's land", not motherland
The diagonal thing is commonly called *winter ventilation* here
I don't even know what those poor people call it in summer
Those are the usual windows and balcony doors here
Millions of bigger and smaller businesses offer to replace your old-school wooden windows and balconies with the newer plastic or wooden ones with insulation, soundproof qualities, diagonal ventilation [and all] In a continental climate, those windows are a must
Newer buildings with apartments for sale often have completely stripped concrete walls and floors with a few wires here and there ([like this] but there's a metal door, and windows/balconies are insulated with plastic systems
Here if can either have old wooden windows (still with double glazing though), or this sort of windows if you ever upgraded them in the last 20 years
So they account for I think about 70% of windows in old commieblocks and 100% in any new construction
The specific window seen on this video will be concidered 'fancy' but not because of the mechanism, rather because it's obviously high-quality and with a nice faux wood finishing
I have similarly looking windows in the main room of my commie block apartment (very similar mechanism, pseudo wood finishing, three glass pieces for better insulation, and UV-reflective glazing) but mine are still much cheaper than the one in the video
Also these windows actually can switch between THREE functions: side-to-side, up-down and 'microventilation' where you put the handle at 45 degrees and the window pops open like in up-down position but it will only go for like quarter of an inch
Very convenient for winter when you still want to have some fresh air but it's too cold to have it open
Might well be, in which case it's even more in another price class than the aluminium profile stuff
I don't think I've ever been to a residential house with modern wooden ones
I don't know if Телебачення Торонто counts, since it's a full-fledged channel now with a professional crew and stuff, but it began with one guy
This is a very humorous political news channel and they have adequate english subtitles
There's no better way to learn about political situation in Ukraine and have a bit of a laugh (and a cry) at the same time
But what about TrashSmash
He's cool
Still is very strong
Not only greeting but also when you go
It is annoying but people believe this is some form of showing respect
>Are you a cat or dog person
I'm a cat person to keep it as a pet, but I like certain dog breeds like Bullterrier, Staffordshire Terrier, Doberman, Corgi
>Which do you think your country prefers
Cats, there are far more people fostering cats and feeding strays than people caring for stray dogs or wanting to take a stray mutt in
In the countryside, guard dogs live outside; only the smallest mutts are let in
Village cats, however, have all the privileges of chilling outside and then eating and sleeping inside
>Which do you think the continent prefers
Also cats
Ruthenian language
Speakers of it mostly live in Carpathian region
> I doubt anyone actually knows about the specific dialects we speak, like how different Bärndütsch and Baslerditsch sound
I don't even know how "Bärndütsch" and "Baslerditsch" sound
Not owning a car is ok, but not holding a DL could be a problem in the future if you would go travel and would want to rent a car for it
P.S. I'm reliant on my car because I use it everyday and travel also
Public transportation in Ukraine is shit
I live smack in the middle of a 1M+ city and my work is literally seven minutes down the street by foot
So no, my life wouldn't be ruined if I suddenly didn't have a car
In fact we have one car in the family and it's used by my wife much more frequently
But it adds a lot of convenience
Public transport, while ubiquitous and cheap, is kinda stressing and gross here
We also like to get out of the city on weekends and drive to some middle of nowhere and that's only possible by car, especially in winter
You absolutely need one here, because public transport here is awful
What can I say
Ha ha
Kyiv has metro
It makes public transport situation slightly better
Sarajevo and Belgrade
Sarajevo, 'cause of WW1 and Belgrade because of Yugoslavia
We have Rav-Kav (meaning multi line )
It's a travel card and you can pay with money you load in it or buy a monthly pass which costs about 50 euro in my metropolitan
when two persons on the streets of Berlin contradicted each other how to pay for the tram, we decided to walk and pay for parking :)
to be fair, public transport payment system is horrible in many EU cities
Why did you put Estonian in quotes
Not trying to be rude, just actually curious
If anyone ask how much I make a year I'll have to make a pause to calculate it, since we always measure salary by month
Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other realms and territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith, Protector of the Realm
As a side note, old royal titles can get ridiculous
Here Nikolai's II one:
By the Grace of God, We, NN, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias, Moscow, Kiev, Vladimir, Novgorod; Tsar of Kazan, Tsar of Astrakhan, Tsar of Poland, Tsar of Siberia, Tsar of Chersonese Taurian, Tsar of Georgia; Lord of Pskov and Grand Prince of Smolensk, Lithuania, Volhynia, Podolia, Finland; Prince of Estland, Livland, Courland, Semigalia, Samogitia, Belostok, Karelia, Tver, Yugra, Perm, Vyatka, Bolgar and others; Lord and Grand Prince of Nizhny Novgorod, Chernigov, Ryazan, Polotsk, Rostov, Yaroslavl, Beloozero, Udoria, Obdoria, Kondia, Vitebsk, Mstislav, and all of the northern countries Master; and Lord of Iberia, Kartli, and Kabardia lands and Armenian provinces; hereditary Sovereign and ruler of the Circassian and Mountainous Princes and of others; Lord of Turkestan; Heir of Norway; Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, Stormarn, Dithmarschen, and Oldenburg, and others, and others, and others
Yeah, that's too
Even when I was freelancing and paying my own taxes I still negotiated about after-tax payments, and tax was automatically added
So if I negotiated 1000$ per month, I would get 1100 or whatever so I get what I negotiated after I paid taxes
Yeah, ninja'd it in)
Our national team won gold in synchronized swimming
We don't have one's, especially in pre-election days
> Is the parto of Zelensky going to take part
nearly 40% of all seats in parliament by prediction
> Btw is he a good president
IMHO, same shit - different president
For now he play "president for the people" role , in the same time has huge oligarch stick in his arse
But people like to believe that he will change something for good
Sad, by they will be disappointed again
>Maybe they still hope that he will change something for good because he is president for a short time
They saw in that show that he will be "against everything bad, for everything good".
Problem is after election society will become passive ( again) or will have another trouble (like war back in 2014), so gov will go out of control again
>Btw what is his political position/ affiliation ? Would say he is left winger, right winger, a centrist or something else
Centrist, probably
He want to deal with everyone and uphold the interests of all
Could you explain the last fact please
I don’t agree with the first fact
I know Home Alone had been aired in Ukraine every year on Christmas, at least it was like this pre 2014
Get the food from our plate stolen by Russa while we argue with Poland over history
Get into a fight over the food with Russia claiming that it didnt take anything
Get Drunk and start telling out very sad stories of our life
Stop stealing from my plate
i have almost everyone at the table on my side
what are you going to do
use the stolen meat to make little figures and say they are people
There are former-soviet camps of "play volleyball and drink" style, and scout-style ones, although less widespread
Not sure how popular it is right now, a decade ago it was a thing
Fun thing about it is that more or less rich parents typically just go abroad with their children, so population in camps is capped by income, unlike for example school
Yes, definitely, in fact my daughter was in one of them the last three weeks
She was absolutely happy to go there since the camp has a childrens' club sort of thing in the city where she's a regular so she knew a lot of people from there already
Yes definitely
There are camps from Soviet era, near the lakes or rivers mostly
There are many modern scout-like camps too
I think majority of kids have a summer camp experience
Well I don't really know all things rich people do, maybe they sent their children to camps abroad, or take vacations while children are at school, whatever
Matter of fact is that these soviet camps aren't considered fancy-shmancy and you don't need to pack your inferiority complex going there
It was
So does the 4th May, when I am writing that comment
The reason of that is Eastern holiday on Sunday and Monday
Also the 1st of May is a day off so it moves from Saturday to Tuesday
Idk, sounds strange to me
We don't use scissors with food generally
For pizza we use knives and sometimes pizza cutters (but most people don't have pizza cutters, so it's more common in restaurants)
In here we don't this
Almost all Ukrainians are conservative and still believe in vaccines, so there is no anti-vax movement (yet
well they are in schools and kindergartens at least
Does Putin count
Yep
We call Putin - Khujlo
Of course :)
Depends because we have been under foreign rule for a good part of our history but I guess It has to go to Stalin
I made a list some time ago, but I don't think I can find it now
In short, we have two separate classes:
* **Ukrainian Literature**, where we study Ukrainian classic literature as well as the literature of the XX century; I believe, modern students also study Ukrainian writers of the XXI century in their curriculum;
* **World** or **Foreign Literature**, which is everything you can think of: ancient, classic, and modern literature; poems and prose; Asian, European, American literature
It's usually divided by periods and genres, so, e.g., we would learn the literature of the Age of Enlightenment, then romanticism, then literary realism, then modernism, etc
The main goal is to understand the defining characteristics of different periods and the social/historical/political/philosophical/scientific basis for them to emerge
As for the literature itself, we have these textbooks called "*хрестоматії/khrestomatiyi*" which is a collection of literary works for the curriculum
Some works are shortened, some are excerpts; poems are usually complete
But some stories and novels we're being assigned to read in summer or on other breaks
I remember being bored out of my mind reading "Ivanhoe" and "The Last of the Mohicans" when I was 12-13 and in a summer camp
Sure, here are a few works that we read at school
Here's also a [link] to a collection of translations to English
"Eneyida" (1798) by Ivan Kotliarevsky
[Here] I wrote a little about it
"Eneyida" was the first literary work written in common people's Ukrainian
And here are some [illustrations] for the poem
"Do the Oxen Bellow, When Their Mangers Are Full
" (1880) by Panas Myrny
"Kaidash's Family" (1878) by Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky
"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors" (1911) Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky
"Forest song" (1911) by Lesya Ukrainka (a play)
Also, I used to be a junky for sad stories about the countryside and serfdom, so I liked Marko Vovchok's "Folk Stories" (1857)
Not all people like these (I mean, sad stories about poor villagers and serfdom)
You are very welcome
There's not a lot of them, but they exist
I rarely see one in the street, but there was at least one in every programming team I worked in
As for society view, most don't care
Maybe some of the older people will ramble a bit, but even that is becoming less common
Pretty sure it’s [Schedryk] known around the world as Carol of the Bells
Eurovision entries are surely second to that :)
[Shedryk]
[Hey, Sokoly]
[Zaporizhian march]
Well, in Ukraine it’s surely is Şikidim, both in Turkish and Ukrainian
Here’s a cover for it in [Turkish] and [Ukrainian]
Good choice
I would also mention Chervona Ruta
Part of Russia/Same as Russia/Soviet Country
I think it's Ukrainian revolution of 1917-1919 that followed Russia's defeat in WWI
That's the first time we had independence in a long time and it left a lasting impact on our national identity as a separate nation
The obvious answer is the Ukrainian revolution 1917-1920, but also I guess that Khmelnytsky Uprising 1648–1657 had a huge effect on our identity
We have it but there must also be meat inside
They can be pretty tasty
I've seen a single KFC in Odessa, and it's in the city's centre
The Baltic states always seem like neighbours, also, Turkey, despite it's over the sea
Maybe because Turkey is a popular holiday destination it doesn't seem too far away
Lithuania and maybe Georgia (but we share Black Sea, so maybe you can say that we have border)
>I'm on social benefits due to a lifelong physical disability
Sorry if this is too personal
It's just my crazy curiosity
Do you have the possibility to work remotely using the Internet
I've seen a lot of Swiss customers who searched for remote employees for different jobs related to IT
Ukraine has this problem as well
Although all dogs in my area are neutered and have an ear chip
Locals love to feed them but don't adopt
A few reasons that contributed to this problem:
* there isn't any state registry of pet owners, legally no one knows when you get(or get rid of) one
* shelters are full and don't accept any new stray dogs
* irresponsible people - one of the example is when people adopt a dog, move to their summer houses("dacha") during the warm period and when it is over they just leave their dogs
Toast, cheese, salami

Switzerland has more opportunities n all
But Austria is like second home for me (over 2 months in Vienna and Niederösterreich)
I think I’d choose Austria ️
Yes, in several types of situations:
* when I want to use a word, but only remember it in a different language or I know the word in one language and feel the appropriate translation in the back of my head, it's like a ghost, but all the words I'm able to articulate don't quite fit the ghost shape;
* when I know the thing, but don't remember the word in any language I speak; happens with complex words as well as with simple everyday words;
* when I vaguely remember the word appropriate to describe a particular thing or phenomena, but it's mostly gibberish; I wonder if such word actually exists or if my brain's just playing games with me
Finnish
Songs in that language sound very cool
"UA: First" former (UT-1) operated by the National Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine, to be honest, I never saw anyone watching it, they're really outdated and can't compete with private channels (most of which belongs to oligarchs)
We don't have specific words for "boyfriend"/"girlfriend" either but unlike in your language, we say "хлопець"/"дівчина", which also means "boy"/"girl". But it really isn't that confusing
And yes, we don't have a word for "sibling" as well
Also, what first was unusual to me while learning English and German, is that they don't have that many commas
We have so many rules for using those
For me, it's not that hard but is for people, who didn't study well or for foreigners
For example "Для мене, наприклад, це не є важко, але для людей, що не вчилися добре чи для іноземців, це важко зрозуміти".
Numbers were confusing to me only in the first month of learning German
But 5 months later, I still need to hear some numbers twice / think about it a bit longer to understand it
But your option is not the worst: when I was deciding between French and German, I watched a video about French numbers and was like NOPE
So here I am, happily learning German
\[balkans scenario intensifies\]

As some people have mentioned, the Zaporozhian Sich
Cossacks had nicknames like "Break-the-Nose", "Kill-the-Wolf", "Forelock", "Coil-the-Tail", "Lil-Porridge", "Lil-Flute", "Bend-the-Misfortune", "Dangler" and so on, which now are typical distinctly Ukrainian last names
> The Zaporozhian Sich was a semi-autonomous polity and proto-state of Cossacks in the 16th to 18th centuries
[...]
> The name "Zaporizhia" refers to the military and political organization of the Cossacks and to the location of their autonomous territory 'beyond the Rapids' (za porohamy) of the Dnipro River
The Dnipro Rapids were a major portage on the north-south Dnipro trade route
The term "sich" is a noun related to the Eastern Slavic verb sech' (сѣчь) – "to chop" or "cut"; it may have been associated with the usual wood sharp-spiked stockades around Cossack settlements
[4]
> Zaporizhia was located in the region around Kakhovka Reservoir in today's south-eastern Ukraine (much of its territory is now flooded by the reservoir)
The area was also known under the historical term, Wild Fields
[\(c\)]
> incredible haircuts
and mustaches, it's all about mustaches
>Also connected to Slovaks
also in western part of Ukraine, mainly Lviv, fifth largest in the Empire at the time
How about Lil' Porridge
He might have started rapping early in life
There's no "Hungarian" part of Ukraine, the region where our Hungarian minority lives has the following ethnic composition as per 2001 census:
Ukrainians **1m**
Hungarians **151k**
Romanians **32k**
Russians	**31k**
Roma	**14k**
Slovaks	**5,6k**
Germans	**3,5k**
and since a lot of people have moved out since I doubt the numbers have grown for any group save for Roma
I do agree about it looking like Eastern Hungary though - areas of Romania with Hungarian minority also look the same
It's a fertile strip of land shared between 4 countries, so there are similarities, of course
No hard feelings here, I'm chill with whoever's trying to make a living here that doesn't involve smuggling cigs across either border regardless of their ethnicity or faith
I do get the historical reference, being a Ukrainian in Hungary, but Lviv itself was more Austrian than Hungarian, if we're continuing said reference
haydamak or haiduk, also a thing in Ukraine
Only an online shop
There were so many people trying to buy something in the first day, that the site is still a little bit laggy
That's more than Sweden has
That's a lot of ikeas
They also completely underestimated the demand and right now you can order delivery only for Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast
Since I am not from the capital, I had to order from a reseller (from Ikea Poland) one more time
Besides that, recently it was found that IKEA uses illegal wood from the Carpathian mountains
And deforestation is one of the main reasons for such serious consequences after recent flooding
Not the best launch in a new market
99% agree that we're eastern Europe and 99% are unaware of the fact we or any other country is supposed to be butthurt about it
Some people also incorrectly include us to [the Commonwealth of Independent States \(CIS\)] which Ukraine is not a part of, but most post-Soviet countries are, that is why people use the term instead of "post-Soviet" which seems like less and less relevant as time goes by
Like, you want to say "this actor is known in the countries where Russian is still widely spoken as a remnant of the Soviet rule" --> you say "in the CIS countries" instead
As I've already specified, it's incorrect for Ukraine and the Baltics
To exit, you need to enter first
> Two states, Ukraine and Turkmenistan, have ratified the CIS Creation Agreement, making them "founding states of the CIS", but did not ratify the subsequent Charter that would make them members of the CIS
These states, while not being formal members of the CIS, were allowed to participate in CIS
They were also allowed to participate in various CIS initiatives, e.g. the Commonwealth of Independent States Free Trade Area, which were, however, formulated mostly as independent multilateral agreements, and not as internal CIS agreements
Additionally, Ukraine became an associate member state of the CIS Economic Union in 1994 and Turkmenistan an associate member state of the CIS in 2005
Also
> [Ukraine] Has never been a member
Largely ceased to participate in CIS from 2014, and withdrew representatives from all statutory bodies of CIS in 2018 as a result of the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and Russia's involvement in the War in Donbas
&nbsp;
>Plus I don't think anyone outside 'CIS' even knows what CIS is
Yeah, I agree, but it fits OP's question
Some Ukrainians would answer with СНГ as in "we're a part of CIS" meaning that we're a part of some Frankenstein's monster made of various state formations which economics gravitate towards Russia, as opposed to the rest of Europe/Asia
Yes, but not right next to the entrance door - we have a hallway without any rugs or carpet, only linoleum, so we can walk with our shoes on there
The hallway is the neutral zone, but the rooms are shoes free
I have house slippers for myself and a few spare pairs of slippers for the guests
Eh, perhaps I just phrased it poorly
Most apartments have this buffer zone with a closet or hangers for the outer clothing, a shoe rack, and a tall mirror
[Something like this] Naturally, you walk there with your shoes on when you're about to step outside or have just entered the apartment (unless the shoes are really dirty from weather conditions)
That's the place to change into house slippers
Our hallway just happens to be 6 m long and 1,5 m wide, with some more space behind the corner
A friend calls it "a waste of space", since, despite the size, its function is still limited due to its narrowness
We used to have a carpet there but disregarded it all the time, so we've removed the carpet and now it's just linoleum which is easy to mop
But the rooms have carpets and they're for house slippers only (hope it makes sense)
We called a plumber once and didn't ask him to change into slippers, so he walked through our carpet-free hallway and stepped on the toilet rug with his outside shoes (instead of stepping on the tiles like a sensible being)
Ever since the rug had faint shoeprint marks that were impossible to remove, so we had to remove the rug instead
This is just one illustration of why our homes are shoes-free
Another reason would be the pure comfort of having just socks/light slippers on, but, judging from this thread, it's just power of habit
Our whole cuisine is poor people food
It was invented by commoners and is made of local ingredients: vegetables, wheat/rye flour, dairy, pork meat and lard, poultry, fish, various fresh and dried fruits
I think pastry and imported fish was something only landlords got to try
Borshch, varenyky, pies, porridges, were common, as long as people's harvest wasn't taken from them
Well, I never moved, but culturally and economically we became closer to Europe and further from Russia, so uh, this
It had been a sort of stalemate since 15-16, due to some agreements we stopped active warfare (they still bomb our positions with mortars though)
Recently, Zelenskyy came to power and he believes that with some concessions he could make a peace agreement and peacefully retake occupied land, but the opposition (including Poroshenko) state that we should have a deal with them, because they would probably trick us, take even more land, use poorly guarded borders to their advantage and many more, partly because we don't know the terms of that peace
Because of that, activists peacefully protest, by the motto "No capitulation
". Even more, because Zelenskyy is going to Paris for negotiations, opposition leaders already plan a new Maidan (revolution)
I might be biased in describing the situation because I do support the opposition
I also wanted to ask Americans and EU citizens: what do you think about the situation
Do you support Ukraine, Russia, or neither
All Slavic ones
Yes and yes
I watched the trailer, it was exceptionally good, so I'm waiting for the release
So "*burattino*" in Italian is a puppet
And Pinocchio is his name, right
In the tale as we know it, the main character's name is [Buratino]

* [The Adventures of Buratino] the animation (1959, Soyuzmultfilm studio in Moscow)
The Italian movie reminds me of these, unlike the Disney animation

So I think it’s quite compensated i dunno
Kyiv historically was the center of our lands because of the natural benefits which it gives to people who live here
The city is located on high hills right upon the biggest and most important river in Ukraine downstream was many rapids so to pass it you had to take your boat to the ground and move to a safe part of the river, what you can't do without the permission of lord who controls this land
From the other side, Kyiv is surrounded by a deep forest full of animals
What else do you need in the 4th century
PS: Dnipro was the highway to the richest and most developed countries of its time (Byzantine Empire, Mediterranean countries) so it naturally became the most important trade road in a region
And on the north, we have a big region of swamps, so it provides additional security to the city

ITT: your whole life was a lie
Edit: Ukrainian was never taught formally to any foreigners until very recently because of that whole USSR thing, so I don't think we have this problem
The norms of teaching Ukrainian as a second language are only now being worked out and the language itself is undergoing massive transformation right now as more young people start speaking it, and generally younger people tend to communicate and engage with foreigners both for leisure and for business, so I think what foreigners learn is all over the place but still pretty modern and widely used by native speakers

Oh no
Imagine being Ukrainian
Most maps have data for Ukraine
Some don't, but most do
Yes my biggest frustration with these maps is Ukraine usually shows as having no data, not bad results
In fact most maps on here only have data from EU countries, sometimes EU countries vs Russia which is always a fun time
I don't know if it's better when economy maps use that Credit Suisse Wealth per Adult Databook where their methodology for Ukraine was "okay, we sorta know what the 50 rich Ukrainians' wealth is, let's just fucking assume that the rest of the country has exactly zero assets despite 70%+ home ownership rates, and divide the 50 rich guys' wealth among the whole population of 43 million, thus obtaining the average wealth in Ukraine to be about fifty five bucks per adult".

Lo-Fi Map of Europe
Made in Photoshop, map from [mapchart
net] art from r/europe's Lo-Fi challenge
I've decided to include the drawings from Dagestan and Scotland as well, so they are marked with gray borders within their countries
As much as I'd love to include all of the drawings, I was afraid the map would be too messy
However, I just found out that u/mateiz3 already made a similar map earlier, so be sure to check out [their version] as well, it includes some more art
Edit: people seem to be really upset about Wales, I definitely would have included Wales if someone had drawn a separate lo-fi girl for them

As someone with a bit of understanding of Russian context I would say it is both a calculated and desperate move on his part
He released two extremely incriminating videos and what
Reaction inside Russian society has been mediocre at best, while he needs to maintain pressure on Putin to stay relevant
Therefore he knowingly flew in to get arrested
What he miscalculated, I think, is Russian people's passivity
Oh well
He can become another good Russian now for all I care
conspiracy theories aside: because his videos didn't create the upheaval he was counting on, while he needs to maintain pressure to stay relevant
it's a desperation strategy if you ask me
> without any democratic consent from the Crimean people
It just shows how little you know on the subject, and highlights that you should not be talking
The actual locals, Crimean Tatars, were forcibly mass deported to middle Asia after WW2, with thousands and thousands dying en route, then perishing in the wilds of Kazakhstan
Meanwhile, russian settlers were already flooding the peninsula (and this kept happening throughout Soviet period, resuming again after the occupation of 2014)
Do Ukrainians want Crimea
Not that much really
It's home of Crimean Tatars, our allies throughout history, and they're getting repeatedly, morbidly fucked by the Russians
Again
DUDE
Go take a history class before taking such stances
What is more of benefit to Ukraine is a period of chaos and instability in Russia, like we saw in 1991-1992
That's our cue
The issue is that this referendum was after armed military invasion
The referendum part is just a legalization of invasion in the eyes of the international community, and based on this thread, it worked
That's ok, our Security Services will have more work to do, but they can handle it
Lol, you have no idea what you're talking about
That's not political instability, that's called democracy
The fact that we have a deranged imperialistic neighbor doesn't change the fact that Ukraine has improved constantly over the past 30 years
[This] is the original Russian invasion claim
The Crimea and a few cities in the east is what they could achieve
We're not talking about specific regions, we're talking about legitimizing armed invasions
> Ukraine doesn't really have any land in Russia which is majority Ukrainian, unlike the other way around
Yes it does
Here's a map of ethnic Ukrainian [population] and the lower right portion still remains within Russia despite being more Ukrainian than some other parts of the country like Crimea (which was Tatar not Russian)
[Wouldn't you like that, cotton boy
There was no widespread secessionist movement before the invasion, and most seccessionist ideas were spreaded by russian military base

Regarding the 3 journalists from Ukraine
Well, it's a little more complicated than a simple number can say
One of them(Stanislav Aseyev) is actually imprisoned by the Russian puppet states/separatists aka DPR on the uncontrolled part of the Donbas warzone
The case with the other 2 guys are a bit more complicated,they kinda helped with creating some Russian propaganda channels but it's kinda muddy since it was during the initial months of war when everything was fuzzy and some people didn't understand what's going on i.e they maybe were unaware what the channels they were setting up would be used for
It can
I've been to Belarus this summer and they are pretty much satisfied with what they have
It's in their culture
I don't know how else to explain
Like they don't care about that
sure, but what if people *actually* think like that
who are you to tell them they're living 'wrong' if they think it's fine
That's my point — even if it's 'bad' bu our standards they don't know it and don't feel missing out on something
Look
As you can see I am from a country that has revolutions every 10 years, so I guess you can believe me that we love our freedom
Nonetheless, I am still 100% sure that 'freedom over everything' is way overrated
Think about it like this: the currency is stable, the streets are clean, you have a job, you have a car, the medical care is free, you live in the city with all the modern attractions
What *else* do you need
Like, what do you need a free press for, if (if
) your life is decent enough
So what if your president is serving for 25 years and actually is a dictator
You don't feel it
And let me tell you, Belarus is fucking *clean* in every sense — you won't see a drunk on the street, everything is spotless, no 'graphic pollution' like ads on the streets, kebab spots and shitty coffee-trucks (it's porbably hard to explain to a European, so you can just [look] at how Kiev is today
), really high quality domestic produce and manufacturing
Out of the three neighbor nations (RU, BY, UA) Belarus is surprisingly the most Europe-feeling-like
So, with that in mind, tell me again why do you need a free press or elections
If it goes south — sure, I won't argue with that
But people *actually* like living there for the most part
It obviously has its downsides, but to me the only thing that matters is how people living there see that
And it's not like they don't have free internet access to read and discuss, it's just that there's nothing to discuss
I was surprised that my Belarussian friends knew more about Russian and Ukrainian politics than me, because it's so boring in their domestic political life they started watching our news
How is that bad
The thing is, imagine if there was suddenly no law against littering or drinking in the streets — I can guarantee you they wouldn't start doing it at large
They just *got used to it*. Now, if suddenly Lukashenko decides to hold an open, free, honest election, I still guarantee that he will win that election
It's not that people love him, but he's *okay* enough to have a stable economy and don't rock the boat
Sure, it's not as fast at changing and economic growth, but on the other side you get stability
People like that
As I said, it's somehow in their culture
People hold 'freedom of speech' too high
I think if given the choice a lot of people will gladly trade freedom of press and election for stability of being safe, well fed and knowing you won't end up on the street tomorrow
I can't pick between Prague and Budapest
I guess all neighboring countries will see an increase in number of medical tourists from Poland
What is the point of testing for  covid exactly if we don't have any specific cure for it

Full shutdown (tl;dr only food stores remain open) tomorrow

As I see these assholes could not even glaze some balconies
If they stop, then will be eaten by putins POMOIKA
This flag was the official flag of independant Belarus after USSR collapsed in 1991
When Lukashenko came to power in 1994 he returned the soviet flag and coat of arms and also gave russian language official status in a referendum in 1995

And it's always shot high from the air, because for residents usually it looks like this:
I remember reading a story about them
I live in Kiev and we have a similar one, so its story begins as one architect realises that by the construction rules walls of a building don't have to be perfectly parallel, you may have as much as 6 degree slant between any two walls
So they made a few curved apartment buildings just for the sake of it and these ones (I think there are actually two of them) were build before the Olympics-80 and they wanted to build 5 of those to represent the rings, but it was quite expensive to build and maintain since it has almost a thousand apartments
It actually has more ground footprint than equivalent typical series
Judging from Wikipedia sources, they basically did it because they could
It's an urban legend though
According to Wikipedia sources, the architects just wanted to diversify the district with some sort of an "architectural dominant" and came up with this
These brainwashed sheep should go protest China, Russia and India

>But don't lie to yourself, not all Nazi's attack people

>I don't like Nazi's either
And yet you jump in, selflessly, to defend nazism
What a hero, the hero the nazis need
The idiot who prefers the status quo or the escalation from nazis because otherwise nazis might get hurt fee fees
>Defeat them through reason
Oh my god, sweet summer child
How can you reason against something that never came from reason
Nazism is not a reasonable stance, it comes from irrationality and everything can be bent to justify that belief
You joker assume that I never tried to reason with nazis
Fact is that you can't reason with them
Nazism is emotionally driven, and I am the enemy
I will be killed if nazism will get any hold of political power again (well, it tries it best in the USA currently and only came close in the country of my neighbors, France)
>I am out of my safe-space
I disagree
You are fully in your safe space
You defend people who will never target you
You are safe
>I'll be called a Nazi-sympathiser by the likes of you
I call a spade a spade and your hurt feeling are not something I give a rats ass about
Because at the end of the day I did not defend nazism and tried to justify genocide
>If anything my comment is more about 'saving' us from violence than it is about 'saving' them
Your comment is about sitting idly by and doing nothing
Worth jack fucking shit
I will not defend Nazism at any point, because Nazism is the ideology that stands for genocide and irrationality
So again, step out of your safe space for once
You might learn that being called a mean word is not the worst
You might also learn something about what Nazis did and why it is not a fucking hill you want to die on

>With solid help from the allies no less, as they feared the Italian communists more
I mean
probably justifiably so
Sure, from the 70's onwards, they came closer to the 'peace, love, puppies and democracy', and became the veritable relatively harmless "Eurocommunists". In the 50s and 60s, however, they were fairly typical [Soviet-style commies] This included support for the crushing of Hungary's revolution, for example (I'm sure Giorgio Napolitano would have liked to take that one back, but back then he was in support of whatever his Soviet comrades were up to)
So yes, Italian communists were absolutely a threat right after WW2, and the prospect of them crushing Italian democracy and turning Italy into a totalitarian Soviet satellite/ally were very real
...Is that meant to suggest that Italian communists were not as dangerous as I claimed they were
I think the fact that they had support from (and were thus beholden to) the Soviets makes them more dangerous, not less
Maybe there's some economic pain, the political climate changes, and suddenly this party beholden to the Soviets goes from 20-25% to 40%+ and starts governing
Their entire raison d'etre was to get into power and stay there, Soviet style
Don't you think this presented a danger to the West, and to Italian democracy
This photo was also banned during USSR times

> The USSR only tried to avoid war by concluding a nonaggression pact like others did
Every Soviet apologist in this thread conveniently omits the [secret part of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact] and the Soviet-German plans for didvinding the Europe (which came to fruition in 1940)
It was not _just_ the non-aggression pact
But you know that
Right
Victims of Red terror under Lenin would like to disagree
> In a half a generation we will have a brand new diagram, and we will laugh at this one like we laugh about people fearing the illuminati now
By your logic, you should laugh at Auschwitz
I just see no reason to branch this out
Stalin operated as a communist, the term stalinism was made up by the commies later to try and separate themselves from that shit
It's like if a republican party starts calling whatever shit trump will do trumpinism to distance themselves and pretend like he wasn't a member of their party
Of course not,both of them has done a lot of crimes,but saying that
>stalinism but not communism
is to blame,is from a descriptivist point trying to shift the blame/make stalin a scapegoat
Lenin, Stalin,Mao and many others called themselves communists(of course what they did differs from "a textbook definition",but the same goes for many things in our history (medieval feodals sure protected their subjects and always ruled with justice))
They described themselves as communists and since they pretty much set an example they are communist
IMO, it's the same as arguing that nazis weren't nazis because a real definition of national socialists says something else
> Yes, that's what I mean
It is already happening
The youngest generation sees Auschwitz and e.g. ancient Babylon as similarly abstract ideas
This is not half a generation
This is the third or even fourth generation
See, I've never heard the term Hitlerism, while I'm sure it exists
we still call it nazism and you don't see nazis walking around, pretending that hitler did his own thing and it has nothing to do with nazis
I live in a country which is probably the perfect example of a communism victim, but if we start calling each occurence a separate name we can make it look like communism wasn't that bad, just had a few bad people
I mean, it's just stalinism, leninism, berianism, holodomorism, gulagism nkvdism, kgbism, stazism happened to occur in the same period, just an unlucky coincidence for a cummunist party
good point about a single leader, they probably just didn't get their chance

"We are sorry, we only wanted to kill some Ukrainians" - Russia
"Oh, that was an unfortunate mistake
Please, pay more attention next time you are going to kill Ukrainians" - the understanding Europe
At least they could agree to stick to one version of lies to not embarrass themselves further
But that's not how Russia works
How the fuck is that an accident
It's a complex machinery and electronics aimed to kill and destroy large aircrafts
They *wanted* to take down a Ukrainian airship, it was a *coincidence*, not and accident, that it was not
Yeah so we have here a very precise missile that can take down a plane 12 000 meters in the air(!), so high a SU fighter can't fly that high, let's just accidentally shoot some stuff
Obvisouly they didn't want to take down any 'western civilized people' but they'd be pretty fine with it being a Ukrainian ship with Ukrainian passengers, don't call it an accident, it's insulting to the dead in the war and in that tragedy
> are okay with their government murdering 298 people
they are okay with their government killing many more people than that, even not only foreigners
You are talking as if Russians are immortal or something
> So either the Russian military is criminally incompetent, or the Russian government is a bunch of neo-imperialists and liars
[You see
Send in an international military coalition to kick out so-called "rebels" in cooperation with Ukrainian military
Keep on sanctioning Russia if it interferes
Block SWIFT for any transactions with Russia besides contract-based oil and gas supplies till Russia stops occupying a sovereign European country, issues official apologies for MH17 and pays compensations to victims' families
Completely shutting off Russia from SWIFT and the international banking system while showing clear and determined effort to rebuild the devastated European energy security, you would have them begging on their knees within weeks
But no, those 2 percents of profit are too darling for the EU elites and the Germans are too scared of nuclear energy to do anything
Oh believe me, they still absolutely do, it just depends on the perceived audience
They declare that there were no Russian troops in Ukraine with a wide shit-eating grin, like something to be proud of, sort of "Yeah we know we did it, and you know we did it, and we know that you know, and there is nothing you can do about it".
The above is for the near neighbors, Ukrainians, Baltics, Poland etc
However when the indended audience is expected to have some sort of "realpolitik" mind set (usually some right-leaning AND left-leaning Westerners who fancy themselves politically savvy), the stance changes to the alternative "Hurr durr Ukrainian nazis, need to protect Russians, land bridge to warm port, but what about America" bullshit
Belarus would go broke on trying to maintain that much border

> since a lot of Russians still come to Finland as tourists every summer
This is relevant only to those living within 200km of the border max
For the vast majority of Russia, you're just a blur of "damn chukhon'tsy", old half-healed Winter War butthurts, and a couple of cheesy 90's comedies
I'd say something like "not exactly a currently active enemy but we fought them or something so not a friend either".
You're also definitely in luck that the vast, vast majority of Russians have no idea that Finland used to be part of the Russian Empire
I implore you to check out /r/russia, a place that only English-speaking, educated, young urban Russians visit, on famously pro-liberal Reddit, and make up your mind whether it's Putin or Russians based on what they say
Edit: /r/russia isn't what it used to be, they just furiously post pictures now lol
For text content I guess check out /r/askarussian
>suddenly
Yes, if you didn't pay attention
Happy cake day
Do you have any idea how literally right you are
In Russians' eyes, we straight up invented Ukraine and placed in on a map where Russia should be
That's literally how they think
If you knew russsian a bit and visited few of their major forums, you would realize that the only reason Putin is getting away with all this shit, is because people are supporting him
They want death to Ukraine, they are glad "Crimea is back" and want more conquest
They are absolutely racist and hate west (and especially USA) and Ukraine with passion
So no, as a Ukrainian, Russians are not cool
They are not “cool” at all
> Seems like if it were he wouldn't have to imprison and assassinate so many political opponents
And people are fuking okay with it
They have "they deserve it" mentality
Many believe opposition to be western agents, and traitors to Russia
>I find it hard to believe any more than roughly 1/3 of the population supports that shit
Believe what you want
You are safe behind NATO and strong military
But any Russian liberal, or Russian turns in to Imperial when topic of Ukraine comes up
When 90% of Russia supports your death and want to conquer your state, perspective is different

This has the other side too
On one of our visits of Amsterdam one of our passports were stolen late in the evening
And our plane is at 7AM
To get temporary passport we would need to go to our embassy with the report from the police
So, we started to look for a police station and we learned that this bug city doesn’t have a police stations in all districts — it’s like 4 or 5 of our them in total
And Google maps was useless — it showed wrong directions to them, and also the stations work till 10PM, and after that they will not take any report, please come down in the morning
And on top of that, the guy inside one of the stations said that we need to go to the central one, it works 24-7
But nope, it was also closed, please come back at 8AM, said very polite guy over the intercom
It was right decision for us to come to the station at 9:30, because, apparently, central police station works from 10AM
Yeah, they were very very polite when took the report from us, but we learned that policemen there are volunteers
In our country police stations are in every district and they work 24/7, it was a little bizarre experience
Edit: apparently, some people thought that this is not a real story
Well, it is real, believe it or not
I guess losing the passport when your plane is in the morning, is not emergency, idk
I called the police, and they suggested we make it to the police station, because we really needed that report
But we arrived to the station at 22:10, or so
> We also have Bidets
but you can't sit on a Bidet with your AR15 on

Speaking about Ukraine: there is no separate statistics for tourists, just for the whole number of visitors - including business trips, transit, and, most importantly, people from border regions that come for cheaper goods and leave on the same day
4 million visits from Moldova were registered in Ukraine for all of these reasons in 2018, making them the largest visiting nation - even though their population is just 3
5 mln
People in Spain and Portugal must be hearing:"SPEG BOL
SPEG

I think this is some class A bullshit
Russian Wikipedia states that majority of tourists in RF come from China, Germany and South Korea

I have a flight booked to Belgrade for this Friday and planned to spend in Serbia two or more weeks
Do you think it will still be OK to come or should I start worrying and search for another place to go

Thank you for your answers guys, I considered my chances and was able to change my ticket for Macedonia
I wish you the victory in the protests and may those corrupted jerks be reminded that the nation is the authority in the country
Not yet, but probably soon
no, they do not deserve
The reality is that most russians are proud of their country
They are proud of annexation of crimea, proud of  poisoning people in London
Proud of war in Georgia, proud of war in Ukraine, proud of war in Syria
In discussions  they refer as "we" to all the deeds of russian "regime". Russians did not get a fraction of what they really deserve yet
I wish i had a countryside place to live, people around me keep ignoring the quarantine, dont wear masks, public transport filled with people, my city is in red zone now (thats the maximum 'oh shit' level of zone possible), our local hospitals already 60% occupied, our local mayor said literally ignore the quarantine and forget about it, despite the city being in red zone they don't close anything, even the night clubs still open and filled, all because they have local elections in a week and all the candidates roam around the blocks and gather people to listen to their pre elections bullshit, each one of them didnt' even say a word about how they will fight pandemic
Im really tired of living with these fucking morons, even back in March i knew this would happen here and it did
All it takes is one infected moron without a mask to walk into the elevator and everyone who goes inside after him is fucked
I really envy people who have either farms or just a place outside cities, its the best place to be in these times

This year in March there is 75 years from mass massacre in Koriukivka, Ukraine - 6700 civilians killed in nazis punitive operation, the whole village was destroyed (1300 houses were burned down, only 10 survived)
The largest massacre in WWII
The more devastating is the fact that it was triggered by local partisans action couple days before - they attacked local Axis garrison of hungarians (80 Axis soldiers were killed there)
2 days later when the punitive action began being committed by up to 500 persons unit of SS and auxiliary police, the partisans were just observing; there was no order to step in (most of partisans were local, from surrounding villages)
Although there were ~5,5 thousands partisans in the region, most of them deployed in neighboring villages
But that was a kind of a tactic for partisans from Red Army command, there were only orders for doing sabotage and raids for killing the enemy manpower
No orders for protecting civilians
Fucking nazis
Fucking communists

If I remember correctly, the proper was to write Білоруський in English is "Belarus". As in "Belarus President" or "Belarus potatoes". Or at least that's what I've been taught in the University back in 2010 when I learned Political translation
Please correct me if I am wrong
writing from Vyborg
Last couple of years made me question this
Did you notice the attacks/assaults on the activists all over the country
Well, by that impeccable logic, Putin was in Yeltsin's team, Yeltsin was in Gorbachev's team (if not for long), and Gorbachev was in Andropov's team (his protege, really), so let's discount the fact that every single one of those transitions were huge shifts in direction

It's sad but all too often hostages become victims when terrorists get eliminated
Ukraine tries to be as cautious as possible in this conflict
Here is [the one in Moscow] You are welcome
You can blame EU as much as you want, but Ukraine isn't part of EU or NATO
Honestly, they don't have reason to be involved, except keeping peace on their borders
Why would a Union want to get involved in more shit if it has major problems within
Bandera is dead, OUN is history, Tyahnybok is not even in the parliament, "elect nazis" is bullshit
So what else do you have, troll
We all know Ukraine is buffer zone between Russia and Europe
Its technically a battlefield and if EU wants to keep peace they will just spectate
I know it breaks our hearts but Russia still has firm grip on Ukraine and EU knows it will not escalate the conflict by simply spectating
There are nazis in the majority of countries of the world
And it seems that Ukraine has a [much less Nazi problem] than many other countries including Russia
Russia would not allow peacekeeping mission in Ukraine as it has major vote in UN
Sending military equipment and supplies is good, but won't help in long run
> Ukraine is still way far in meeting the Copenhagen Criteria
When you purge corruption and nationalistic ideologies out of governing bodies, then will Ukraine be able to join Union and possibly NATO

My uncle, who speaks ukranian/russian/english, took a trip to some caves in Croatia
Upon arrival, they were told that russian speaking guide will arrive with group in an hour, and the guy there could only talk in croatian
Uncle told him - kay, let's go, talk in croatian, just slowly
I was later told that you pick up like 90% of what's being said - if the speaker is slow enough
Bonus point: russian tourists dodged
I've been to Croatia shortly and I felt that, you guys are super chill and the country is fucking beautiful ! <3

You use a lot of words that are considered "old" here and not really used anymore, but are still understood
It's fun
As for music, it doesn't exactly fit the discussion because there isn't much language in there, but still check out ONUKA
I've recently discovered her for myself and just in awe on the music quality (lives on youtube preferred)
Without getting too political
A lot of Ukrainians feel very similar about Croatia
Because it's an example of a country that had to fight a similar fight for its independence, and succeeded admirably (that is, it's not only independent, but vibrant and free)
Don't push this old Soviet/Russian propagandist idea again
By that spoiled logic you may come to not tolerate any greetings and up to the most of the dictionaries' content at all in modern Europe, which is still under heavy influence of Russian bribed political establishment
For me, the only people still entitled to be shocked by the phrase are those who regard Ukrainian independence as a form of dangerous extremism, which is complete noncense
Russians themselves were the greatest Nazis allies at the beginning of WW2, with the common deeds included their friendly devision of Poland, and then outnumbered any other of ethnic groups within the collaborationist forces
So let's do not tolerate "Здравуствуйте, товарищи" as well, and so on, and forth
Oh boy, those things that happen in Poland's independent day  shouldn't be tolerated as well, especially in modern Europe
I talk about far-rights march
Every single year
Do you view Piłsudski as a genocidal barbarian dictator or as a national hero who saved Poland
That's a rhetorical question
Nazi has so much connection to Bandera, as Piłsudski
Come on, you share me a 1 minute read article, where it clearly says that "Jewish groups have linked Bandera's followers to the mass murders of Jews". Bandera's followers and Bandera are different people
There was Polish collaborators as well, but I don't state that every Pole is a collaborator
You just have to use a bit of critical thinking and it becomes clear
And yeah, check this [book] as well as [all nations make mistakes, even Poles]
who said anything about glorification lmao
If you care enough about Ukranian take on Volyn, please check this video
It has Polish subtitles If you click add them and then choose Polish
I\`m interested to hear what you think about this video
Of course you did not offend Russia, but rather complimented them
Also for Ukraine it's not really offensive too, since this area is the origin of the whole "Rus'" and "Russia" name, which later [was hijacked by Muscovites]

You read about the part where the people they caught are alleged to work for Russia (and they say they have good evidence of it), right
Regardless of this, Russia *is* a terrorist state which murders its opponents in the West, never mind Ukraine (where, among others, it murdered almost 300 Dutch, Malaysian and other civilians)
so, Ukraine faked death of russian journalist, who was out of favor in Kremlin, who was probably ordered to kill by russian FSB
but still blame Ukraine

There's Russian proverb like that, except it's the stick that shoots
> From my understanding, it was Russian-backed and directed revolutionaries that shot down a civilian airliner due to some sort of mix-up
"Revolutionaries", right
No, "revolutionaries" can't learn to operate a Buk SAM complex on a Sunday afternoon
It takes many months of professional training by an actual army, and it's a team of people, so it was Russian army soldiers in a Russian Buk
The real issue is not of course to simply admit a mistake and pay out compensation, the real issue is to admit engaging in an undeclared war of aggression against another sovereign state
>I'm not denying Russia does some shady shit, I'm just saying they aren't that much worse than our "allies" to the west
That's the most successful part of their propaganda effort - muddy the waters, convince ordinary people of this false equivalence between Russian imperialism and America's imperfect, sometimes criminal, but nevertheless a lot more restrained foreign policy
Especially in Europe, especially in places like Slovenia
It's mighty convenient to put "allies" in quotes when you know your ass is protected from any possible serious war not really by Slovenian military, but by the very allies to the west you denigrate
I guess you're meaning the [bottom right]

It's in fact remnant from soviet times and become some sort of mentality
Also add fact that we for the last 20 years wanted to be buffer state - not with Russia, not with the West
Look at countries who chose their side after the collapse of the Soviet Union  - West aligned one mostly doing good, they have problems, but compare to us they are doing good
Russia aligned - yes, they have "stability", but they slowly stagnate as for me

It severely limits the ability of people to coordinate, and to even stay updated on the events
E.g., there's a telegram channel where people send reports of ongoing events at specific places (police moves, clashes, points of gathering etc)
Without mobile internet access, with severely limited unstable broadband, and no media but state media, it gives a huge edge to the police on the streets
On that topic, I can't recommend Bloodlands by Timothy Snyder enough for a good bird's eye overview of what Eastern Europe went through in the 1930s and 1940s.
That can be followed up with "Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944–1956" by Anne Applebaum

Over 100 peope were killed by (most likely although not proven) russian or prorussian snipers in the center of Kyiv, [it all began as a pro EU protest with EU flags] Now nobody gives a single fuck and Germany [still launders russian money] I can understand them doing it because we are just some scrubs from a 3rd world country nobody cares about, obviously, thats understandable, but i cant understand them being friendly with russians after MH17
Germany even voted Russia back into PACE after they got kicked out form it for downing a plane (**4** germans also were on board)
Im getting more and more dissapointed whenever i see this flag, it now reminds me of grief and sadness and every passing year it gets me more depressed when i realise we are nowhere near in joining EU and probably will always be against Russia on our own
I was really surprised to find google have been pretty thorough with my city in Ukraine, i mean they even have my home and i can see my windows on the 8th floor, the fact they drove here to the small yard with  dead end confuses me, like why, they need to make like 3 turns from the main street to get here, i was probably just chilling home and totally missed a visit from google car, fascinating and kinda creepy too

It's nice to see that not all Russians are brain-washed and blinded with their love for Putin
> Are there elections coming
yup, in March and somewhere in middle of autumn
> How do you think things got better for Ukraine
In what way
We became the centerpiece of international politics and I believe our government utilized it pretty well
We moved much closer to Europe: visa-free travel, financial reform made investing outside and inside Ukraine easier, many internal standards and regulations were changed to follow EU instead of Russia
Even cultural shift was enormous with Ukrainian celebrities replacing Russian ones, even the church became independent from Russia (500-year challenge)
People working in the industries that could take advantage of the shift (IT services or export-oriented ones) are benefiting immensely
Those who relied on Russia (metallurgy or heavy industry) suffered but Russia made many of those regions unlivable anyway

Fun facts
EU has been working on actively reducing its CO2 emission since 80-early 90th (While USA kept pumping more and more) and yet economy is still standing strong, and Germany manufacturing is huge
Maybe trying to reduce pollution you do, doesn't outright kills your economy, unlike what some people claim
Also thanks based EU for trying to do at least something to combat this problem ;_;7
I guess
No more euromoney
You backed out of
EU membership
Same in Ukraine
Government closed metro, so people started using buses and trams, so they are overcrowded
Despite the regulation that buses and trams can ride only 10 people per carriage, which obviously doesn't work
Russia's best option is to do nothing and wait
Armenian current leader came to power after their velvet revolution when the nation protested fraudulent elections won by the corrupted pro-Russian candidate
In all such cases, new leaders were becoming Putin's personal enemies endangering his regime, and all of them ended in wars
Russia directly invaded Georgia at first, then Ukraine
Armenian case just gives Putin a lucky chance to do war with the third party hands
All they need just to wait a little bit until poor military and economic results lead to the revolutionary leaders get discredited and bring Armenia back again into brotherly Russia suffocating claws
Anther Russia's bonus is that the Belarus and Navalny issues are getting to the background at least for a while
Yes Ukraine accounted for 20% of the GPD back in the day
that's like 3 Scotlands compared to England
POLSKA STRONK
Ah, good to see bird country where it belongs
This is really awesome
I think it's important that people from the establishment are not the outcasts in the society
The more they hide behind the bodyguards and tall walls - the more they will see society as a milking cow, rather than a community to which they belong

Humans are too close together
Meanwhile we stop building shit and massively move to Poland and probably every second worker on these sites is ukrainian
because even the shittiest job in Poland pays times more than a good job in Ukraine
This is what's referred to as France
Although in fairness, most people in most countries are instinctively on board with any cause that boils down to them paying less and getting more
Ukraine: so is your language like 99% similar to Russian
How did Portugal manage that
Looks strange compared to its neighbors
From my past experience, France should be white
>to make war in Europe unthinkable
It did not work
There was also that Yugoslavia thing
Did he say in the end "mojemo dali
" which means "shall we continue
"?  Because in Ukranian "mojemo dali" means "shall we continue
Ukraine is in danger actually
Our healthcare system wouldn't handle even a couple of thousands of sick people with coronavirus
In addition, we have plenty of citizens, who work in Italy
Now most of them have returned back home
Our only protection is strong quarantine, which I hope we got in time
Edit: grammar
> If we compare to Ukraine which has or at least close to single digit  infections in a population of 42m and they're way better prepared then  Sweden
Ukraine and be prepared, yeah right
Trust me, we are not prepared
Our number is low because we didn't do many tests, as soon as we start doing test en masse we will be at least at Poland level (if not worse)
Thanks, will fix it
Sorry for my bad English
I wonder if this explicit dictatorship move will finally persuade Germany to stop the Putin's beloved political project called Nordstream
Putin is totally unhinged
Oh no, anyway
Him staying in Germany would absolutely undo his previous work while also killing off quite a lot of protest momentum (they wouldn't happen in the first place)
It's not about personal safety, I assume
One funny thing is that at least 1/3 of Russian households still don't have gas
While in the deposits, excess gas is burned away with huge flares
For about 50% of the territory in winter, people warm themselves with wood and coal, and that's 2020
Pff, few weeks ago we have the same in Ukraine, 38 in Dnipro

> £9000 per year is absolutely fucking insane
Well, for non-EU students it's about the same(or higher) in [Denmark] too, and in Sweden as well: my kid was eye-balling some unis there, and for Ukrainians it'd be about 350000-400000 SEK for the whole course in biotech, big data or gamedev-related courses
Meanwhile Poland offers their education for as low as $500-1000 per semester, even less for talented kids, but the thing is I doubt (especially after talking to their representatives at recent 'Education in Poland' promo-event)  Polish education in those matters is much better than Ukrainian, and Ukrainian is just meh at most
The journalist's face really sells it
Ukrainian should be the same as French
There is one putain we don't like
"лайно" is almost never used in this context
In fact I wouldn't be surprised if literal "fuck" is used more often than "лайно" in these globalized days
We in Ukraine actually say блядь more often

> Later it came under the control of the Grand Duchy of Moscow
Uh, that's one way to put how Moscow promised to uphold the Pskov independent democracy in exchange for sending whatever prince they wanted to govern them, and then betraying the agreements and showing up to negotiations with an army and a puppet governor
And then forcibly changing the local laws by taking the city's officials hostage and throwing them into a dungeon
And a century later drowning the lands of Novgorod and Pskov democracies in blood and murdering the bishop of Pskov (by the hand of Tsar himself)
We are all brothers with one language and one culture
Everybody who disagrees with this great message are fascists
They and their families will be wiped off the face of the earth, drowned in Volkhov river, shot in Katyn, sent to rot in Far East, whatever
And replaced by someone with one language and one culture
Thank you for listening to the abridged history of Russia

We could learn a lesson from Russia
People here buying lots of packages of rice, pasta and toilet paper
But the problem is: borders are closed, and we can't buy some of the cool tasty products (as fruits and cheese)
Though we can manage without them
Yes sensible adults can change things
The Articles of Confederation was replaced with the Constitution
Estonia is the most advanced country in Europe and might be in the whole world, even Switzerland learned some shit from them, like free public transport
Benelux have nothing on Estonia, i would pick Estonia anyday
Also our government tries to copy estonian digitalization because its the best
You've portrayed Ukraine so accurately: it shows not only our country's physical state but emotional too
Jokes aside, looks cool
Yo what the fuck
Trying pull ass out from the swamp
True
Without the Russia flair I would assume that this is a funny dark joke, but with the Russia flair it reads like a threat
Clearly they were referring to Russia not holding back and invading Ukraine in Crimea and Donbas
Also, of course we hate your government, not your people
We know that you don't have a real say in your government and that your government does nearly as much to hurt its own citizens as to hurt neighboring countries
It's not russophobic for us to be upset about the people your government has killed and oppressed
Yes, a few people lump your people together with your government and that leads them to wish death on random Russians
That's  despicable of them and they are absolutely wrong to do it
They're also a very small minority
Most of us just want your government to fuck off and die and for your people to have the same freedoms and opportunities we want for ourselves
A coup d'etat is a forceful change
There were large scale protests against Yanukovych's corruption and abuse of power
Yanukovych agreed to a compromise on reverting some of his changes and holding early elections
The next day he abandoned his post and ran to Russia
No one forced him out of office
Seriously dude, I get that in Russia you are completely inundated by propaganda, but you should do your own reading about it
The small beginning of the protests (including the chant you shared) was about preferring the EU to Russia and being upset that Yanukovych was choosing closer ties with Russia over the EU after promising closer ties with the EU, but the main protests had nothing to do with Russia and everything to do with Yanukovych and his government being extremely corrupt and abusive
And honestly, we will never know how Crimeans would have felt about the new government after the early elections
There wasn't a lot of polling done before Russia attacked and stole their opportunity to have a say
It's possible that Crimea would have wanted even greater autonomy than it already had or even independence, but again, we'll never know because Russia attacked before anyone got the chance to find out what Crimeans wanted based on the small change in government
Polski jabka, dobre jabka
Aggressive fascist junta with support of russophobic Western allies attacks poor innocent Russia
Looks very
familiar
Blaming the victim is a tried-and-true KGB trick used by Russia till our days to justify attacking Russia's neighbors
Unfortunately there are too many naive people in the world still believing Russia and whitewashing its dictators
If you want to compete you have two option: you either get yourself on the same level as others, or
you can try to get others on your level
The Russians are obviously doing the later
They know that they can't compete with other by standards of living, prosperity and freedom, so they come up with different types of bullshit
Funding different right-wing parties is one of them
The outright lies are common in Russian propaganda
Sad thing that nobody still acknowledges that this type of shit is a type of warfare
Being half-Russian living in Ukraine I witnessed all this hysteria and hypocrisy on the Russian federal channels, when what we call ATO (anti-terrorist operation) unfolded 2014-2015
This is really disturbing
I just hope that someone will come up with a smart idea to counter this
>false history on the Finnish

Great picture
Probably thinking "Damn, I shouldn't have repressed all those generals, they would be soo helpful now" or "Damn, I shouldn't have ignored for so long the reports about the German invasion back in June".
Oh, so that's why they sacrificed a million of my countrymen and soldiers from other Soviet "republics" to retake Kyiv for his birthday
Fuck this piece of shit and I hope his death was slow and agonizing
Looks so sad about it lmao
Also, isn't the new transcription for the city Kyiv
I may be wrong ofc, just wondering
War on three fronts (Africa, large Eastern European, and some relatively passive till 1944 Western Front), having a delusional leadership that cared more about the extermination of population than winning a war
No chance
Yes, absolutely, after the prison of nations dissolved we have had the best time in our history since at the very least 16th century, and that's even accounting for the current Russian invasion, shitty economy and corruption, this is still the best time Ukraine ever had, tells you quite a lot about our history
They did
The fire on Khreschatyk street raged for almost a week and the street was completely destroyed
Fuck Soviets
And then caused his own genocide
What a hero
You surely do a great favor to our country representation out there with all those "alternative opinion" comments
[Holodomor]
Nah, play into russian narrative about Nazis, cause that's definitely who took over Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea
Cause it's Nazis who repressed Ukrainians in 1917-1921, 1922, 1932-1933, 1937, 1939-1945, 1947, and, you know, the rest of the century till today
Nazis thing for sure
It was deliberate and man-made though
He didn't save us and certainly did more harm than good
Period
Same azov and right sector that saved Mariupil' from the actual fascists
Why don't you tell me what you think of liberators co we can settle the case and report you to SBU ;)
You literally can't see the irony yourself - an occupier comes to your land and you play into his narratives because you don't see the USSR as an occupier too
I guess none of your relatives died from famine, or in Finland or Romania for a piece of land for Stalin
Oh, right, that was before the so called great war, it doesn't count
And I didn't death threat you, I merely hope you will change the way you perceive russians when the collaborationism law goes into effect
That, or you Fanta/nesquik will come from your water pipes just like in Crimea
Ah yes, priest blessing the hospital, so catholics can praise god (and not the doctor) when a doctor with 50 years of experience treats your cancer

A priest sprinkling some water on a dummy is totally on par with fucking ISIS
And a couple hours before that what now is Greek flag was a battlefield between red and blue
Good thing it resolved peacefully
Just to illustrate:
[this was a residence of Ukrainian president Yanukovich] and Ukraine is much more poorer country than Russia with approximately same level of Corruption
When i've been there back in 2014, it took me about 4 hours of walking around, and i still didn't visited all the corners - missed the Zoo and few other buildings inside the territory of the estate
Wow
It's incredibly ugly
Seriously, it looks like a hodgepodge of styles and shapes
Yeah, it is huge, me and my friend hung there for a half of a day and did not visited all the stuff
And Yanukovich was a president of much poorer country than Putin, and Putin is at power for something about 18 years, and Yanukovich was 4 years president and some 3-4 years as Prime minister
Basically Yanukovich was a beggar comparing to Putin
Godspeed
Lol tell me about 1940s...its 2020 my parents live on 70 dollars pensions, like most pensioneers here, they cant imagine eating like this without someone helping, i have absolutely no desire to become old and we are literally neighbouring countries, but we definitely live in different centuries, they wont throw away any of the things you show, most would just take it home instead of throwing it into the bin or sell for lower price
Imagine if supermarkets started selling expired products, I doubt it will be better alternative (even though some still do, not in EU though)
You've got the ukrainian upvotes the moment you used the correct romanized form of Lviv
I assume they were either polish(Lwów) or russian(Lvov)
But don't let them discourage you
Edit: Oh, they criticized the use of "w"s instead of "v"s. I was referring to people using the russian-influenced "Lvov" instead of the correct "Lviv". "Lwiw" and "Lviv" doesn't seem like a big difference to me honestly
That name is already trademarked by Russia
In Ukraine it's around 30 people
Yes that's true

Such is life in eastern Europe((((
It is so vegetated

You could have added that "Poland,  which is a country where there invented vodka" it would be just as relevant

"The discovery of the cause of coeliac disease may also be partly attributed to the Dutch famine
With wheat in very short supply there was an improvement at a children's ward of coeliac patients
Stories tell of the first precious supplies of bread being given specifically to the (no longer) sick children, prompting an immediate relapse
Thus in the 1940s the Dutch paediatrician Dr
Willem Dicke was able to corroborate his previously researched hypothesis that wheat intake was aggravating coeliac disease
Later Dicke went on to prove his theory
My mom suffered a forced famine, as in, government agents would come and take whatever they wanted and you could say nothing or get shot
My grandpa added extra layers of wall on their home for hidden grain storage
She instilled me with the idea that all that is served is to be eaten, no matter how full you feel, how much you already had during the day

Can't say for other countries, but for Ukraine this country is utter BS
Ukraine has [about 460] cities (міста), each more than 1000 inhabitants - and that already exceeds the number of the dots for Ukraine on the map
But Ukraine also has about [830 small towns] (селища міського типу), which also have more than 1000 inhabitants each
And there also are villages (села), some of which have more than 1000 inhabitants
There actually are [almost 100 villages] with more than 5000 inhabitants in Ukraine, and I was too lazy to look up how much more with *just* 1000+.
If the map was correct, Ukraine has to be all shiny there
So I can't say whether the map makes any sense for other countries, but for Ukraine it is totally made-up nonsense
Hutsul = Rusyn = Ukrainians
They never leave it, it's Eastern Europe
Rusyn is generally old name of Ukrainians
Rusyn means Son of Rus ( Kyivan Rus, Ruthenia )
And now it almost not used in order to avoid misunderstandings with rassians (Moskovians)
And yes there are for ex Lemky, which are also Rusyn
But they are not Hutsul

236 in Ukraine lmao, is it average between millions of poor people and our president
The data is a bit outdated
June, 2018, Ukraine, official average salary: 9141UAH ~ $350
Oof
Yeah, that's a good point
And you can also filter per sector; for example, in Ukraine an experienced software engineer would be making around 2200EUR per month, which makes you basically a tiny bit short of a king (a very good apartment, 70 sqm in the center of Kiev will be 800 EUR absolute tops)
Instead in France you'd be 2700-3400 and paying the same for 35 sqm, a fuck load of taxes, plus everything else is 2 to 10 times as expensive
In Ukraine I could be completely careless about money, in France I can't.
The data is a bit outdated
June, 2018, Ukraine, official average salary: 9141UAH ~ $350
