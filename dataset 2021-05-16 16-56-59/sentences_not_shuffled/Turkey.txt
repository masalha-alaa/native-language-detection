There is overwhelming violence against women in Turkey
And the first think the absolute ignorant cunts asks: `well, what was she wearing
`, ` what is she doing there this late
The years 1980-1983 were very dark years for Turkey - a paranoid nationalist military junta coupled with guerilla warfare in the countryside and massive political repression
Add torture in military prisons, kangaroo courts, and state-funded assassinations to that
Pardon my French, but the bastard who caused all that died before his jail sentence was approved
Turkey is the country with most arrested journalists
Mostly because at the time, they criticised the government
Delusional
The 1980s were better than 1970s in the sense that there wasn't an undeclared civil war
The 1970s saw much bloodshed, massacres and riots in Turkey as well as an economic crisis and literally no government
So it was *better*, not exactly *good*.
I see another Turk above me has said an iron fist was necessary
While it might have been necessary to rein in far-left and far-right terrorists, nothing can excuse the torture, forced disappearances and arrests
It was a very dark time
No they are not
I think the commentor is emotional in this one and only look at bad things, therefore didin't mention why thr coup happened
In that years the left and right wing fights happened everday
Everday people died because of that political beliefs
The state itself were more islamic than ever (you can look at "kudüs mitingi" which is endorsed by third biggest political party, MSP, at that time)
New religious cults established that time (thanks to MSP again)
Economy was literally shit (the president itself said that "we need even 75 cent"), terrorism was at its peak (politic terrorists killed people in their house, in universities, in cinemas), then there was islamic terrorism where hundreds of alevies killed
Yes, the woman couldn't go outside, the lovers couldn't travel, because they were in fear of being beated by islamics
There were no goverment because nobody was majority
Then there was president elections(cumhurbaşkanı) the 2 candicates couldnt get majority of votes despite election held dozens of times in the senate
My parents, grandparents and the majority of the elders, all says the same thing
"The coup was a necessity and it was known" even the politicians haven't done anything against it
Nobody, even the politicans, against to the coup
Only ones affected by it, *when the coup happened*, were hardcore islamics, hardcore nationalists and terrorists
Everyone knows bad things, political tortures, murders happened after the coup, they weren't necessity, this things must be done in front courts, justice should have been applied
Personally I think, and everyone I know, an iron fist needed for turkey at that time, country was driven to a civil war more than ever
Also, commentor is wrong about paronoidsim of junta
Junta wasn't paranoid they, the terror was real in eastern proviences (I have lived there about 5 years, even a lot of kurds, despite hating military, support the coup because of terrorism *again*)
There were wrongdoings of junta too, they tried to erase kurdish language identity thinking that will erase the terrorism too, but it only strenght it
Correct, but that's something a lot of people know about
The 1980 coup gets very little attention in foreign media
Eh no, hardly relevant at all
In fact, the general who orchestrated the 1980 coup was prosecuted under Erdogan's government
Not to add the CIA and NATO directly supported said military junta
Although the coup helped political Islamism
Before the coup, Turkish identity was considered to be primarily a merger of Central Asia and Anatolia which was emphasized by constant references to the Hittites and whatnot
The coup leaders created the "Turkish-Islamic Synthesis" that considered Islam an essential part of Turkish culture
Cyprus, if I have to
No need for unification talks anymore
People either move to Turkey or Greece
Done
Greece
Sorry neighbour but I'd really love to have the big Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea

"You have one month to solve this or I will press the button for realz
France and Turkey(not really, ottoman empire) are some of the first countries to legalize homosexuality
France in 1791
Ottomans in 1858
Always been legal in Turkey since its foundation
Whats a proggresive law
Giving people the freedom to not endure pain any longer
Why should suicide be painful when their life is already painful enough
Marriage is unfortunately not legal yet
Nobody forced her to take the job
Suleiman the magnificent: Hey, since we are so deep into the enemy territory, why not take Vienna as well
Army: what could go wrong
*Winged Hussar Noises*
Enver Pasha going sicko mode and attacking Russia because he wanted to build a great Turkic empire with Central Asia
He lost half the fucking country
It's been a while since we passed bruh moments
It's now way beyond this
A 6 months old baby dying of cold in his house with no heating
Or a father committing suicide because he could not buy new pants for his child
(20 tl was found in his pocket, equal to 2€) There are many more
Mother giving hair dryer to elder kid to keep warm and hanging herself in the other room
Have literally no idea about the native language equivalents of the terms I use on a daily basis since I have always learned/taught/been taught/written about them in English
It's a bit disturbing when I have to talk about them in Turkish
I thought I was the only one
I sometimes even have to google them because all I know is the English version of the word and not the word in my language
To be honest I don’t like my accent
I know it is very difficult to pronounce a word correctly
Because, we straight read the word
Writing and sound form of a word is same
It makes hard province it
For Turkey, it is because of prices
An iPhone costs double the price in what it costs in USA with taxes
For a long time it was cheaper to travel to USA and buy iPhone rather than buying in Apple Store in Turkey
Other thing is purchase power of household
minimum wage currently around 300€~ so this limits what technology you can buy while hunger limit for 4 people house hold is 400€~.
In Turkey it is about the prices
While Android phones try to adjust their price wit the economy of the people
Apple usually has a standart price
Stop comparing an os and a device
Android is as good as ios
However many top tier android devices are worse than iphones
Consider comparing google pixels and iphones
Price/Performance
And iPhone users don't bully Android users here
Though I'm not from Adana, I heard from my friends some neighborhoods in there have such places that police can't go in))
İm not ashamed of Istanbul but the im ashamed of the way we treat it
That city deserves better care
The same goes for Istanbul
Porto has personality
I have mostly worked with honest people like they would say if they couldn’t wake up or lost track of time, etc
But there are phases like “There was a car accident
” “Buses were full
” “I forgot something at home and had to return back
” These were what my friends have told or I have heard from someone else
“There was a traffic
” Which often times doesn’t have to be a lie
I just mostly lie about the duration of the traffic, if I’m being late
The interviewee who almost got the job but then got mad at a question and started screaming at the interviewer
Wait
we did that tho
I sense pettiness in this comment
There was some talk of it after the coup but i don't think anyone has actually proposed it into parliament
And even if they do Erdogan himself can't pass it with his coalition alone(by himself he can do a referendum in it) so it's unlikely to happen to say the least
That saidn
#AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Yea, Our ruling party is a bunch if shitheads that seem to get elected because"they built roads"
That said,
#AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I am pretty sure it's a constitutional thing which requires a supermajority to directly pass and Erdogan has only 341 of the 350 required
Edit: Actually he can't even put it to referendum as that requires 360 votes and directly passing is actually 400 votes
I have been taught British English but Internet and Media is heavy influence by American English so that creates problem for my vocabulary
I try to solve the problem by only using British English(speaking as well as writing)
no, even i learned british english at school, I always use american english because i like it more
so because i’m already used to speak american english, i don’t mix them
Yes, that's normal I guess
Here in Turkey, the norm is British English in the classroom so that's basically what you learn
Then you have the popular media predominantly in American English so you pick up lots of things from there as well
The end result is a mix
Learned and learnt
I've never used "lift". I prefer "elevator".
All the names of the Turk rulers’ names
The most popular ones: Kaan/Kağan (means ruler, also referred as Khan in English) , Mete, Teoman, Oğuz (ancestors of Turkish Turks), Alparslan, Atilla (Attila, you all know who), Batuhan etc
There is Cengiz (Ghengis) although he’s a Mongolian ruler, it’s also a Turkish name
There are names from Turkish mythology or eposses such as: Buğra, Ceren, Serenay, Gökhan, Kürşat etc
There are just too many of them
More than I can count
Most of them are from Turkic rulers, mythology, eposses or nature
I’d like to add that we share a lot of common names with Mongolians too
Kaan, Kaǧan, Atilla, Ata, and we have the -han suffix
Like, Gökhan(khan of the sky) Atahan(Forefather khan) and stuff like that
Kaan, or Kaǧan is like a saying double han
Hanhan, if you will
Like king of kings
Aysu, Esin, Beyza, Asena(very cool name imo), Başak, the list goes on
The oldest one I can think of right now is probably Osman, it was the name of Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Empire
We use name Atilla a lot
Baltic German
It’s Arabic, not Turkish
Edit: The name the commenter below said was Abdülahmet or something but he changed it to Osman
Gökhan is from mythology
It means ruler of the sky
Must be written Gökhan
Otherwise it does not make sense
Gök means sky, and the name means King of the Sky
Gokhan simply isn't a thing
Kaan and Kağan are the same, yes
But social backgrounds matter
Kağan is a name given by more educated families, as it is the correct form of the name
Kaan is a lazy version that could be given by a lower class of family
I know, sounds rough
But it is the truth to some degree, as both are considered legit names
I believe it is, Gök Kağan
People who are less educated tend to give Arabic names to their children, as they are more religious and do not consider things like how the Arabic culture is invading ours and corrupting it
My parents are academics, and I have a Turkish name, and I am grateful for it
I wouldn't have wanted an Arabic name, at all
But other than that, we do have variations to some names
But class hierarchy is often indicated by accents and way people speak
Much like how it is in most other countries
>  People in villages will have lower class names than people in cities
This holds true in some regions of Turkey
Nah that never happens but I do forget some Turkish words from time to time and translate the English word in google translate
Sometimes but it doesn’t happen very often
Once I didn’t recognise my own language
I had a friend from Mali who didn’t speak Turkish well so we mostly spoke English
One day, I was translating him to my Türkmen friend and she stopped me mid sentence and said that he’s speaking Turkish
Turns out he switched to Turkish while talking but I didn’t realise and kept on translating Turkish to Turkish
I also forget words which makes me sound pretentious when I say it out loud
The worst part is when they aren’t compatible
Sometimes English is better at describing something, but it sounds icky used in my native
Well, no, it doesn't sound like gibberish
But most of the time I speak English with my friends and at this point we probably speak better English than Turkish
I can relate
My sister and I sometimes bring German to the mix (I took German in high school and she took courses)
My mom has gotten used to it to the point she starts mocking with gibberish sounds
Turkey has the oldest known place of worship, the approximately 12 thousand year old Göbekli Tepe
Santa Claus was born in what is today Turkey
The oldest church in the world is located in Turkey, rumoured to have been founded by Saint Peter
The first female combat pilot was Turkish, along with the first female jet combat pilot and according to some accounts, the first black combat pilot
Turkey has the highest per capita tea consumption, at over 3 kilos per year
Our national anthem is the only anthem in the world that starts with "Fear not
" (Korkma
The oldest man built structure "Göbeklitepe" is situated in Turkey, Şanlıurfa, dating back 12 thousand years ago
Turkey is the most tea consuming country in the world
In Hagia Sophia (which is a museum, obviously
), there is a carved text (dating back to 9th century) by a Viking which says "Halvdan was here
Anatolia has served 3 very important land trade routes which are: Silk Road between China and Anatolia, Royal Road by Darius I. and Spice Roads (mostly by the coast)
This is because Turkey is the bridge between Europe, Asia and Middle East
FunFact: Both Silk Road and Spice Roads were blocked by first Seljuks, which caused the failed crusades, and then by the Ottomans, which started the Age of Discovery (because the Ottomans had closed the roads, Europeans had to find another route
While trying to go around the world, they found America and other routes around Africa
Let me try:
*Last night, (I) my friends with very fancy a restaurant to went
Yeah
It's horrible
This interesting an experience bewill
Grammarour, European Languages to very different
My language actually very simple me according
But others that be don't think
Definitely, but I have a suggestion in addition: Can't we just hold world cups or Olympics permanently in a neutral country/city
It seems like there'll be corruption and crimes swept under the rug no matter who is chosen if we get somewhere new every 4-5 years
Hell, there could be a permanent "International Olympic Village".
I nominate Switzerland
I mean, is qatar bad
If so, yeah, of course
But i havent heard a lot of bad things about qatar, certainly not as much as other countries in the region
Probably just me not paying attention to the news and stuff
I nominate the car parking place in the Vatican
> Switzerland is already seat of all those highly corrupt organizations hosting those events
FIFA and the IOC both have their HQ in Switzerland
Both organizations are highly corrupt deep into their cores
I'm aware, I just couldn't think of another ultra-neutral country large enough to have Olympic sports facilities
oof, thats not good
thats all i can say
Regarding the guardian article, I suggest taking a look at [this flood on Twitter,] it's quite informative
Obviously, Qatar (or the GCC in general) is not the best place in the world to be an immigrant worker in construction, but that article sounds extremely biased with exaggerated numbers and questionable sources
It is sad to see so many people are ready to believe those manipulative numbers in the article without even bothering to see if they have reliable sources or considering how realistic it would be to have 10 work-related deaths per week on average for 10 years between 2010-2020
Qatar has come a long way in terms of workers' rights especially comparing to other countries in the region, and it's all due to the international pressure they face
With the new labor reforms, workers can now change jobs or leave the country without the consent of their current employees, they now have minimum wage with compulsory allowances for food and housing, free healthcare for everyone, etc
This will have positive long-term consequences for everyone in the region in the long run
They still have a long way to go obviously, but what I'm saying is maybe there's a more productive way other than boycotting that gets you some actual results
Erdogan has stated a while back :
"If they have dollar we have God (on our side)"
referring to the economic crisis of the Lira losing value
But there is definitely more stupid things than this
"We'll be a superpower in the year of 2023" -Erdogan
"Our economy is stable and growing the one who says there's an economic crisis are terrorists
" -Erdogan
"We will destroy every piece of nationalism
" (Later on makes an alliance with the nationalist party like a chad and uses natinalist propaganda" -Erdogan
"Say that to the litte Turgut" - Turgut Özal
"Aegea is not a greek lake, neither a turkish like
Because Aegea is not a lake
" -Süleyman Demirel
"Tükeş is son of Turk, Erbakan is son of Islam, Ecevit is son of people, and am i a son of a bitch
" -Süleyman Demirel
"Why we should close the brothels
The people will fuck us if we do that" -Süleyman Demirel
"Close the brothels so that citizens come here to fuck us
-Süleyman Demirel, who served in 7 governments in various positions; he was the prime minister in one of them and also became the president later on (back when that position was purely symbolic)
Background info: Prostitution is legal and regulated in Turkey
Devlet Bahçeli (there's two but I remember only one): 2009
Add the numbers, you get: 11
Remove the zero's you get: 29
(in a hyped way) ADD 11 AND 29 TOGETHER, YOU GET 40, IT'S OFFICIALLY OUR 40^TH ANNIVERSARY
(applause)
how about "40 YAPAR"
"40 YAPAR" -Devlet Bahçeli
I'll ask one out of context question, how do you pronounce the 6^th letter of the politican's first name
Süleyman Demirel was a real memer
Oh that's just straight up karen-like behaviour
hmm, I haven't heard about this before
Pro gamer move
i havent heard that too, we banned it cuz of the infos on YPG/SDF page of wiki
I get the joke but the statement is referring to the political power of the dollar since Trump was threatening with embargo
Hahaha that's gold
He said it to a physicist (Erdal İnönü)
By saying "Little Turgut" he actually meant his grandson lol
I mean you're pretty much there, didn't even notice an error in there
Thanks, I wondered ever since I saw that letter
Well, i didnt know that till u say
Tnx for the info and being sensible :)
Holy crap it's (nearly) exactly the same with me
I was born december 2006, I learned basic vocabulary from minecraft, and the speaking from movies and YouTube vids
The unthinkable happened, mosques are closed(sort of) and Call of Prayer in Turkish as “Don’t come for prayer, do it in your house”.
Context, Erdogan’s main argue on mosques is that opposition(supposedly) has turn them into barn(literally minimum 70 years ago) now Erdogan’s government practically closed the mosques and Erdogan said they Called for Prayer in Turkish which was bad (because showing Arabic and Arab culture as in Islam)
Today gave information in mosques for not to come in Turkish which it considers as Call of Prayer
Current government is actually taking some action
Mosques are closed
Mosques are no more
Finally they did something reasonable
From Istanbul to all Europe, just by a train
Would be superior
Look for my country first if someone has replied or not, if not answer it first then read other replies
I always see them
My dad was so affected by some of them when I was a kid that he would talk about them nonstop
It went on for like a solid two three years
Gonna sound cliche but turkey
You know, the bird
Metan gas
I thougt the pronunciation was weird because I have heard it many times in Turkish
You make the “a” a little longer
There has never been an anti-German sentiment in Turkey in the last 30 years that I can remember
On the contrary, Turkish people who are born in Germany typically end up in some form of Germanophilia if they come back to Turkey for work at some point
We don't have anything against germans but generaly we don't like the Turks in Germany
They are often rich and stupid
Even though they earn there and spend it here they say that Turkey is heaven and germany is hell
And they vote for dictators when they don't even encounter the consequences
Nah we make a lot of dark jokes about them but i guess we like germans in a way
There are a lot of turks that like in germany so it is expected
Oh it might be different among those who reside in Germany, to me it seems the diaspora Turks are overly conservative and nationalistic, much more so than the people living in Turkey, which is more or less expected I guess
Mine is merely a personal observation, of course
I've probably interacted/still interact with 10-20 Germany-born Turkish people tops in my working context
But the general attitude I've seen among them is quite Germany-centric
It seems they have some sort of a "German, good, non-German, bad" mentality while interpreting daily or professional occurrences
I can imagine the things that you frequently see or encounter, really
But your assumption has two major flaws:
You don't get to see/notice the ones who are already integrated well
That's because they just act normal and there's no way to know how many they are
The psychology and sociology of criminal behaviour is way more complicated than one's national identity, if not ethnical
Certain identities are believed to commit more crimes than others; however, empirical research shows that immigrant status and criminal behaviour are actually inversely related ([an example study] What many people seem to suggest as a solution, namely deportation, does not even reduce the crime rates ([an example study]
It's more like a complex web of interacting factors, caused by both immigrants themselves, natives of the host country, the legal system itself, education, culture, and many more
I am just talking about the general prejudice and it's according to some interviews
It's general there are good people all around the world but I am glad you don't have a problem with it
Lol There are a lot of Turks there doing that too
Germans don't like Turks
Oh I personally believe there is at least a group of immigrants who consciously refuse to integrate, which is quite difficult for me to understand
And I believe so both because of my personal observation and the fact that such a conscious refusal has resulted in at least [one theory] related to learning the language of the host country
In social science, apparently it is still an ongoing debate if people actually refuse to integrate or not as I understand from [this] study, which seems to review both arguments
There's also the issue of cultural hybridisation, by the way
Those clusters you've mentioned typically form their own (a third) culture, which borrows from the cultures of both host and home countries but is essentially different from both
And the issue gets even more complicated after that since it reaches a point where those people are accepted neither in their home country or their host country
Btw my country is no big shot too
Their education level are compareable to those in germany or austria
Carefour is French
I thought we owned it becaise we had our old reliable SA(Sabancı Company) symbol on it
It turns out that they just colabrated with each other
I always thought Nokia phones were Japanese until I was informed that it is in fact Finnish
The phone manufacturer casper
I didn't think that it could have been Turkish
I thought it was like American
Really ? isn't "kinder" means children in German ?
I always though Germans give great easy name to a chocolate brand :)
Now, that makes two of us, mate
God bless
What you guys really need is price fixing for certain medical services
The government already allocates enough tax money into health care to give everyone ample health care as is
Not much without a filter
Not many people trust tap water that changes color time to time
I don’t even water my plants with tap water lol
All the time
At this point I dream, think, even remember my memories in English
Do NOT say "Oh, i thought you would be speaking arabic
" or " I didnt know women were allowed to not wear hijabs
Be extra nice to stray animals, especially cats
In the wrong neighborhood you can get hospitalized for kicking a cat
Never talk about politics, religion or sexuality with people you don't know very well
Pretend to like food even if you don't.
Don't be too loud when you're talking in your own language
Only the Japanese and koreans get a pass because we like them very much for some reason
You are expected to take your shoes off when you're in a clean place, such as houses or mosques
People of the same gender might get physical with you, kissing, hugging, putting their hands over your shoulder
It means they're trying to be nice to you
Just go along with it
Old people have very high expectations in terms of respect, be passive when conversing with them
Don’t publicly criticize Erdoğan or you go jail bye bye
-We're not talking Arabic and we're not Arabs and most of the people would be mad if you say "i thought you were arab etc"
-Do not talk about religion with the old people specially in central anatolia
(Western anatolia is more tolerant about it)
-Armenian Genocide (it is not a historical event anymore it became just a political tool so people would disagree with you and won't even listen you)
-Take off your shoes before entering a house
(And a tip never trust the taxi drivers
Never
This doesn't apply to foreigners obviously
Turkish and kurdish speaking
Arabic direved words do exits in turkish but they are very much adapted to turkish
When it comes to religion i would say it is much more religious than Europe but much less religous than the Middle East
The thing about Turkey is that we always live things in extreme
I mean we had the caliphate before the Turkish Republic was founded but right after the Republic was founded we adapted a very french way of secularism where doing things like wearing hijabs in certain places were prohibited
Now we are kind of in a limbo where we dont know what we are doing
If you are interested in this topic and have like 4 hours to spare watch the videos of Kraut about Turkey
(Sorry for being long lol)
I think it is more spoken by refugees
Idk tbh i just hear arabic when my grandma prays lmao
Turkish in general applies to this as it is very different from European languages
A simple example coming to my mind is Assassin's Creed Revelations
It was very clear voice actors had a hard time
By the way in comics Magneto was German Jew if I remember correctly
Writers of the movie probably forgot this and ran as a Polish Jew
Yeah it sounded as if someone was choking them I laugh whenever I see a clip of AC Revelations the people on the street sound even funnier than the ones in cutscenes,another great example of horrendous Turkish voice acting would probably be Uncharted 2 it was a realy good game but the Turkish was realy funky
(the Turkish spoken by guards were bad the dub they did for the game is top notch)
My main problem with games and movies that portray Turkey,West Asia or South America is that disgusting looking yellow tint they use as a filter it looks so bad and the music is always off as well instead of using Turkish music they sometimes use bedouin music I even heard Indian music once
People have no idea what Turkey is like
Exactly
It is like (not all Americans) Americans think outside of their circle (NA/west EU) all the world is same with minor differences
It is also a fact that Turkish language and culture are very different for someone never heard of them
Thank you, I kinda forgot Magneto was in Poland at the start of the movie
That explains everything
People that live in the mountains communicate with guns
You shoot to the air to say hi/im here and the other person shoots back to confirm that he/she heard the gunshot
Yeah, it is very normal to greet people while on hiking
Same in Turkey
If you said to a torrenter "you are a thief" he'd just look at you like you said the world is flat or something
He wouldn't say "you are wrong" he would just be puzzled
That concept is just alien here
People don't want to pay like 1/6 of their wage on one video game
Mutlu Noeller ve Yeni Yılınız Kutlu Olsun
Joyeux Noël et bonne année
In Turkish we have the “German Way” of paying the bill
It means everyone pays for only what they ate
I have no idea why we call it the German Way though
Fransız kalmak means to be left french
It means to feel foreign or you can use it when someone is looking blankly
"*Alman Hesabı*" (German Constant) in Turkish
That's weird and interesting to see, every nation have the same expression with a different nation
We have "Alman usulü" (the German way) for splitting the bill, and "Çingene düğünü" (Gypsy wedding) to refer to a loud crowd of people
Those are the only ones that come to mind
“Alman hesabı” is our phrase for “to go Dutch”. Alman means German in Turkish and the root of the second word (hesap) means “fee/bill”. I believe it comes from Germans’ hard discipline
I’ve witnessed some of them even split the food and mark the juice bottles
Also we have “Fransız kalmak” which means “to not understand the context”. Fransız means French and the whole phrase could be translated as “being French”. I don’t know why French though
In Turkish we have "Olaya Fransız kalmak" (verbatim: "to be all French to something") which means "to be a stranger to something".
I believe you say "be all Greek to something" in English
Are we strong captain
- well acording to french yeah
Erdoğan must be jealous
He had to win a "referendum" and an "election" before he could get those powers
Hungary's trajectory is looking very bad
We're out here, hoping to be democratic again but instead more countries are starting to be like us
Sad
Kicking Hungary out of EU isn't going to kick Orban out of Hungary
Whenever EU is bad with us, Erdoğan uses it like "imperialist colonialists don't like it when we don't obey them" and such rhetoric works magic on the whole nation
A dictator needs enemies to present himself as an underdog to his nation
Remember this comment in the next election in Turkey because I'd bet my ass on the line that Erdoğan is going to fuel a diplomatic crisis with some countries again when that happens
People say things like "let's embargo Turkey" something like that would actually help Erdoğan
Europeans have a really hard time understanding the mind of a dictator and the mentality of a nation that lives under their rule, which is understandable
You might ask "then what should be done
" I don't know
I think these are phases countries have to go through
Intervening accomplishes nothing
I'm not a fatalistic guy at all, but you can't stop a nation from ruining itself
There's always someone else to blame
Authoritarian leaders always create false enemies, they never admit their fault
It happened here too
Erdogan got limitless power, destroyed the economy but won't take responsibility for it
Illiberal democracies tend to keep "the enemy" vaguely defined
That's why all this "Brussels" and "George Soros" business is there
This way you can put any word you want into their mouth, and your people will complete the rest of the definition of "the enemy" depending on their personal thoughts and therefore share the burden of creating propaganda with the people
Creating an adequate amount of propaganda through state channels is not possible unless you got 1984 tier propaganda channels, you have to involve the people
Things being clearly defined is not a good thing for the ruling party
The only thing that should be clearly defined is that the government is good and "the enemy" is bad
By keeping everything everything vague, creation of an alternative reality that most of the nation can believe in becomes easier
I don't know much about Hungary's station, but the way leaders like that act isn't much different wherever you are in the world
Also I doubt EU money is the thing that's keeping Orban from wanting to quit
Money you can't embezzle is not money
And embezzling EU funds should be really difficult I'd imagine
I'd say he wants EU to kick Hungary instead to get some sweet propaganda weapons, as if he'd become a martyr, but I don't know much about it like I said so I might be mistaken
Construction sector is the darling of oligarchs
Erdoğan is fond of it too and it works exactly the same way you said
I see a lot of similarities
Depends on the accent, sure
When rural southerners talk to one another in my presence, I can hardly understand half of what they say
They say in a sarcastic tone “Not everyone has to study
This country needs porters too
” Personally, I find it quite condescending for the people who got the short end of the stick in life
McDonald’s and garbage man also come to mind
We can add body shoppers, textile workers to that list as well
I can't even work at McDonald's (or at least be a cashier) because my math is shit lmao
That if you don’t study well, you’ll end up working at a McDonald’s.
"Eğer okuyup adam olmazsan çöpçü veya inşaatçı olursun, ya da sanayide çalışırsın."
"If you don't study and be a man, you would be a garbageman or a builder, maybe you would be a worker in an industrial area"
Body shoppers or car mechanic
I wish I was a car mechanic though
Earn more than what I do now
Same
Years ago my family doctor told me to become a “water heater repairman” (şofbenci)
Apparently he called a repairman and found out he makes more than my doctor
that all we eat is not Turkey ...
Turkey is not a desert-covered country
We have a very diverse geography and climate here
In spring, you can watch the Bosphorus while blossomed judas trees covers the region and then next day, travel to east to visit some beautiful ski resorts still covered with snow
We have both cold glaciers and sunny, relaxing beaches
Being located in Middle East doesn't mean we live in sandy deserts and ride camels
Poland had penguins too right
It used to be mandatory in here up until 2016
Then some retard in high court thought it was against human rights to force taking shots without parent’s consent
Talk about going backwards
God I hate this government so much
It is unethical to force anyone to take substances in their body
I do not support mandatory vaccinations
As for anti-vax, I blame it on the big corporations who have broken the trust of people
Anti-vax originated from the USA
Looking at the prices of their medicine and shit like the opioid epidemic, why should anyone trust big pharma
Restore trust in the public that you have good intentions in everything and stop fucking up with everything then you wl get people vaxxing again
You are right
Rights for children work differently
Legal guardians are required by law to provide for their children
Deliberately starving a child is legally abuse
Should not vaccinating be abuse as well
Humans get hungry to know when to eat
But there is no natural desire to get vaccinations
However I draw the differences here
Food there is still choice
But a vaccination is a very certain substance
Your analogy to food would be more accurate if parents were force to give their kids milk
If a certain food like milk is singled out then it would be unethical
Yea, no
It isn't the same thing
We have a food called "[gözleme] which also mean observing
I saw a guy selling this food with a label written observing :)
Probably a handicraft symposium (el işi sempozyumu) being translated as hand job symposium
They tried to write handicraft
Maybe father is the cook and she does him
Just a theory
Well, that's good
~~Finally the entire country won't be sold to the Russians for cheap~~
It is about 30 °C and humid but I have learned how to exist within the hotness
Days are not that bad
Sun is hot but i just get under a shade
And there is good airflow too
But nights are the bad one
I cant even sleep
I just get so sweaty and lumpy
When i open the window the cats try to get in, so i cant even open windows
Turn on AC
Shower twice a day
Go out in the evening
That temperature is standard for us but this year we didn’t have winter and summer came early so that kinda sucks
It’s my favourite season but it’s hard to enjoy it when you’re cooked up at home because of pandemic
Edit: grammar
It happens, can't explain
My parents can't do it but I can
I like the weather and sun a lot
Everywhere and everything feels alive in this season
The temperature makes me energetic and joyful
Also, swimming
Beaches are windy in other seasons but in summer, you can truly enjoy it
The breeze coming from the sea feels so nice
I just love everything about it, man
Turkish people are born with their tea cups(the curved ones that are called 'ince belli' in turkish, i don't know how to translate it, a direct translation would be slim waisted but it sounds weird too
“Local Frenchman too angry to yield terrorism”
“Türkiye Devleti bir Cumhuriyettir
State of Turkey is a Republic
This article can’t be changed under any circumstances which is protected by the article 4
Ottoman lovers can keep dreaming
Turkey is a republic
Turkish Republic is a humanitarian, Kemalist Nationalist, secular, social and law-bound state within the context of social solidarity and peace
Turkish Republic, with it’s government and nation is an undividable whole, It’s language is Turkish
It’s flag is a white crescent and a star on a red background
It’s national anthem is the march if independence
It’s capital is Ankara
The first three sections in this constitution can’t be changed and their unchangibility is undisputable
Turkey
**ARTICLE 1-** The State of Turkey is a Republic
Also, Art 4 states that provision of Article 1 (with two other aritcles, 2 and 3
)  shall not be amended, nor shall their amendment be proposed
There’s enough of them to make my blood boil
[This one
There are worse parts of South-East Turkey that suffer from terrorism but my mother's family is from a town called Kilis that had a population of ~100k but now hosts around 150k Syrian refugees due to proximity to the Syrian border
It's a very difficult situation for everyone
The part that has kept this madman in charge ever since I was born
Southeastern Turkey
Most unstable part of our country
There are some terrorist because of the proximity to the middle east
Also the infrastructure is not as good as in the western parts
Central Anatolia
It’s very bland, the climate is dry and it’s underdeveloped
You don’t see many people planning a trip there
I feel sorry for people who has to live there
(That’s excluding Ankara but personally I don’t find it interesting either
Armenian thingy
East parts due to terrorism
All except West ?
(and some minorities in big cities)
Yeah
Ankara isn't interestin either
Sure
Its pretty good
Its stable, beautiful architecture( mostly old Armeanian churches and old russian buildings), good infrastructure
It holds a lot of tourists from within Turkey and also a lot of tourists from Iran
I would recomend visiting this region
Especially city of Kars
Its really beautifull, still needs some renovation tho
There are lots of people in Turkey is not ethnically Turk
But this doesn’t make them terrorist
Most of these terrorist follow separatist movement since 1980’s.
Probably the Coup/Revolution of 27th May 1960
Or there is 3rd May 1944 when pro-nazi authors and politicians were put on trial
That turkish independence war was also a civil war
We were not just fought with greece, allience and armenia but the ottoman sultanate(Istanbul goverment), islamist and kurdish rebellions too
It looks like a sad story 2 years
C’mon Ivaylo you can do better
That is literally one of the most famous battles in Central European history
And it isn't about your country either
Not nazi fascist
It’s also not independence war but liberation war which is very minor mistake but a lot of our historians try to fix this for a long time including Halil Inalcık himself but west seems to no give a fuck
I haven't checked *all* other languages but Turkish (and Azerbaijani I guess) differenciates between witnessed and heard information by adding suffixes
&#x200B;
* geldi (S/He came, I know it for sure
S/He probably is still here)
* gelmiş (S/He came, I learnt it not by witnessing
But the source is probably right)
* geldiymiş (Someone said s/he came, I dont know
* gelmişmiş (Someone said s/he came, I dont believe them
* gelmişti (s/he was here, but might have left
* geldiydi (I know s/he was here, but might have left
In Turkish, we have "Afiyet olsun" and "Kolay gelsin".
Afiyet olsun: It's like "bon appetit" but not exactly the same
It is more like "I wish this dish brings you joy and health
" I believe its origin is Arabic
Kolay gelsin: This is what you say to someone who served you in some way
Like a waiter, bartender, garbageman etc
It roughly means "I wish what you're doing won't tire you much". You can also say that to a random person working like a construction worker or a janitor
I use this phrase a lot and it's driving me crazy when I am abroad as there is no translation
Turkish has gender-neutral pronouns, which I believe to be one of the best features of the language
For example, all the third person pronouns in English (he, she and it) correspond to “o”.
As it is becoming more and more accepted to use “they” as a third person pronoun to avoid referring to a gender or sex, I truly love how that distinction is being naturally averted
japanese doesnt have R or L sounds
it has (R+L)/2 sound
therefore, they cannot differentiate R and L sounds while speaking foreign languages
Also, We don't have grammatical genders
We basically say "O" for 3rd single person
We have that in Turkish too
Depending on the social demography swear words changes
Thats pretty common
cık,
kind of click-ish sound is also existent here
I guess we're talking about the same sound
u/AllinWaker Very interesting questions, thanks
The reporter almost always uses -di to create a credibility
But if they are spessifically mentioning that it is a gathered knowledge, they use -miş. Same with politicians
The person being interviewed will use one of them casually and accordingly
In science, it depends on the person speaking
A researcher who is qualified on the topic will use -di
-mış will be used for topics one does not fully comprehend
In religious stories, -miş is used in my experience
But if the event is being explained in perspective of History -di will be used
In storytelling, just like english, many tenses can be used
If it is an obviously fake story like a fairytale, -miş should be used to get avoid the guilt of lying
This is for what I call "Big city dialect" which is a mix of many others
I believe it varies depending on the region, but I know it applies for South Western dialects
- I've never been to any religion related place, Ive never read Quran or Bible etc etc-
But afaik its "geldi
" for religions as one believes its true cause they believe with their whole heart
Agglutinative gang
Yes, snow example of you is perfectly right
And now you're confusing me
But imagining a reporter speaking with -mış, just feels off
Same for a science or history textbook
They did not see the Big Bang or evolution happening
But a scientist does not use -mış, eventhough logic should work the same with "kar yağmış".
AHH NOW I'VE GOT IT: When we use -mış, it means "I am a secondary source, believe if you trust the source". They don't use -mış, so they mean "I am the source, believe if you trust me". In "kar yağmış", they dont imply a lack of credibility because you can also gather the same info easily
Turkish here, we abolish that few years before
That's horrible in winters, especially if you live in the western parts of the country
Daily life in Istanbul starts before the sunrise
Students go to school at dark, and employees do not see sunlight in a day except the working hours
Also, illumination during the morning increasing the electricty bills
Bad decision
We did that a few years ago and you will really miss the sun
I used to say same thing before my country abolish it
It's not how it works in winter:( Many people cannot see sunlight when they coming back from their work
Also, students have to go school at dark in the morning
Most of Turkey is in GMT+2 anyway
I don't know why our government decided on GMT+3
Even Syria uses +2
We love animals
You can see bird/cat/dog houses/foods everywhere in İstanbul
Domestic cats' original habitat is Anatolia, Turkey and today you can see cats everywhere you go indoors and outdoors
There's even a subreddit for them [/r/TurkishCats/]
Despite still being high, smoking rates in Turkey have gone down significantly in the last 20 years
They were 38% in 2000 and went down to 27% in 2019
High tobacco tax, ban of smoking in indoor places and anti-smoking ads have all helped
We were the second humans to ever build a city and establish ourselves
Those ancient Turks were called Çatal höyük.
While the wild habitat of the domestic cat is Anatolia in Turkey
Now I want to get in jail in Germany, then try if I can escape from it
Then I guess I have to flee somewhere they can't find me, any ideas
Paris or İstanbul
I really think İstanbul would be chaotic enough for a gta game
Civilian motor vehicles are not allowed on the islands
But I agree with Istanbul wholeheartedly l, not because it is my hometown, but the crime, corruption, social satire, crazy driving, beautiful sceneries, hoods that look like shanties, glamorous Bosporus mansions, country clubs are all there
Ideally, you would start in the one side and then the other side of the Bosporus gets unlocked
A good writer might be able to write the best GTA game in Istanbul, and I played all the GTA games over and over again
Definitely would be amazing
Istanbul’s historic areas are very small when compared to the rest of the city, and they are mostly accessible by car
Our taxi drivers usually take the long route and show off the city
Thats is how the taxi driver goes to retirement
If they speak English, it's a tourist trap
Especially for restaurants
Ironic, isn't it
Taxi drivers, they just make your way longer to take more money
You lose more money and arrive your destination later
Sometimes they even tryna trap local people if they don't know around very well
The only affordable places near Raekoja Plats are probably McDonald's and Hesburger
Taxi drivers got Uber banned in Turkey
They are truly sons of bitches
My recommendation for tourists coming to Turkey is to use BiTaksi for at least checking how much the fare is beforehand and using Google Maps or Yandex Navi to avoid taking the long way
The problem with Turkish taxis isn’t the price or the convenience, but the drivers are not vetted so at any time a junkie can be in charge of your life, and the taxis are awful as well
No leg room, smell, etc
You cannot use Uber, they pulled out of the Turkish market
Instead, use BiTaksi to call a taxi, they are rated at the end of the trip like Uber so the experience is overall more positive
Always use a navigation app
The good thing about BiTaksi is you know the approximate fare beforehand if you enter the address, and the address is forwarded to the drivers phone so only minimal interaction is necessary
, and you can pay with your CC
All ride share apps are banned, it’s either a taxi or public transport
I don't like watching football or eating kebab
I don't have relatives in Germany
Oh and, not an avid tea drinker
I don’t like football that much but I do fit in a national cliche
I have relatives in Netherlands, France, Germany and USA
I drink 5-10 glasses of tea in a day
In fact I am drinking tea right now
I am a Turkish nationalist
Feels too fatty for my taste
I'd rather have a ribeye steak or fish
Holy shit
How people write the letter "a" with their hand
Varies, mostly **α.**
In mathematics
"a" for most equations, α for geometry
Writing “a” in handwriting seems pretty difficult to me and I know only one person who writes “a”
I do wish they were joking sometimes but the truth is something is really wrong upstairs
Look that was all janissaries fault ok we won’t have independent armies this time only state army
We tried it and it didn’t work
Too much fat in the foods, my body almost wasn't able to consume the fat
There is a tunnel network under Istanbul that connects the whole city
There are some known entrances but some of them are under some normal houses or are just hiding under some foliage
No one exactly knows where all of the tunnels are
There are some tunnels that just a few locals know about
Also, the studies about the places are mostly in Ottoman Turkish and are kept secret
*Hayli* in Turkish (pronounced "highly") means *highly* for some weird coincidence
*Yabancı* in Turkish means foreigner, comes from the root *yaban* meaning wild
*Yabanjin* in Japanese means stranger, perhaps with wild qualities
Although the two languages are of the same greater language family, it is unlikely that these words have the same origin
We say *pisi pisi* to cats when we call them
Its pronunciation is so similar to English word pussy, that means cat of course
*Malaka* in Greek means asshole, dickhead, stupid, sometimes ignorant person
And Turkish word *malak* means idiot in street slang
Tho they are absolutely not related
In turkish
Pil = battery
Hap = pills
I just had hard time memorizing and confused
I think it literally came from english
It actually means young buffalo
According to TDK, it's Persian
It did not
must have
Greece, Italy, France, Spain, Austria, Switzerland
I like mediterranean and mountains
Austria ,Hungary or germany .they has beautifull roads
Mate, I want to live in Northern countries because I love cold and dark weathers
No, but I always get nervous when my mum talks about Arabs around Arab tourists
Geez, that must've been embarrassing as fuck
Iceland being far away from everyone else is what I like about it, lol
Few years ago I've learned that there are more than one standart deck of playing cards and the one I know was French deck
Never seen any other deck irl
Not just seniors
I think everyone should periodically
It might be more frequently after 70
Below 20 is chilly and I’ll wear jacket
Below 15 is cold, I’ll wear a thicker jacket and maybe scarf
Below 10 is very cold
I’ll wear a thick coat, maybe some hat and scarf
Below 5 is deadly cold
I’ll wear the thickest clothes I own
Below 0, I’ll wear nothing because I’ll be under my blanket in bed, not going outside lol
I second this comment
Strange to see some people are
Being brave
There's also a phrase that I love so much:
"If we built a statue of this guy, there won't be enough  concrete to build his balls
Or we just yell "THERE ISN'T ENOUGH CONCRETE" when someone does something brave
We have an idiom that goes like "if we builld a statue of him, concrete we have won't be enough for his balls" that means he is a great, awesome, clever, brave, trustable person
Badass in Turkish
*"Heykelini diksek taşaklarına beton yetmez
"If we erect his/her sculpture, we won't have enough concrete to fill his/her balls
"Heykelini diksek taşaklarına beton yetmez" (There wouldn't be enough concrete for his balls if we tried to erect a statue of him) is a semi-popular saying used for chad people (internet slang word one, not the country one)
Being brave, it can also mean that someone is successful or manly
Sometimes it gets specific like that guys balls weight 50 kilos
It's used for praising people you admire or feel thankful
Heykelini diksek taşaklarına beton yetmez
If we made a statue of you, we wouldn't have enough concrete for your balls
Is a weirdly common sentence close friends use when the other makes a nice gesture
Friend took care of your work so you could have time with your girlfriend
This is what he is gonna hear next day
Having big balls also means being powerful in a modern world sense
Business men with lots of money and connections are people with heavy balls
I’d say it is “with balls” instead of “big balls” but I suppose if someone is reeeeaaly powerful it can be “ with big balls”
Just turned 18 this year and for next elections anything but the current goverment is ok
Turkish youth smokes a lot, it’s considered a “popular” thing to do and so do a lot of middle aged people
Turkey
Idk percentage but in Turkey they raised tax for tobacco products changed packs to black and put disgusting photos and they banned to sell rolled packs of cigs(they used to sell in tobacco shops it was about 1/4 price of market ones(5₺) ) I was going to buy one back about one month ago but I couldn't afford pack and rolled ones are banned
Market ones are 20₺ (2
3€ )and  5₺(0
5 €) for pre rolled ones I know it sounds cheap but since our economy is 'very good' our minimal vage is 270 Euro it is like you know unsettlingly high for a 17 yo student who tries to survive with 50tl a week
I wish man but I am sure he isn't going to get elected next time but I am worried about who is going to get elected after him it could be worse
I know right it is surreal I was going to buy a pc back few years ago and able to save 3000 tl but it just melt down there
Pc parts prices got insanely high(due to exchange and demand) average pc that will stand me for 5 6 years costs 7-10 k now it is about 3-4 times my dad's monthly income :')
Thank you man best for me is work hard and immigrate
Und ich lerne Deutsch im die Schule
Guten Tag Kind stranger
Man thank you so much have a great day
"So you guys are Arabs right
"Can women even vote in turkey"
Turkey is not an Arab country
Yeah same story with Turkish too
We call it Hollanda
I did not know that Turkey has the most ICU beds per capita in the world
Hope it can save us :(
Portakal in turkish
You never get used to it
Cruise ship intensifies
Unfortunately this looks like an error
This [Wikipedia source] from Ministry of Health Lists lists a total 38
098 ICU-CCB beds, of which 12
402 are newborn ICU units and 1
625 are for children
I'm not sure how the average numbers are calculated, but I'm pretty sure they don't include the newborn units
Still Turkey seems to be one of the leading countries with these numbers
And do sanctions ever work as intended ?
all you do is crippling an economy leading daily life folk to suffer more while the head of the state is gaining more bullets for his "look they are all against us, give me more power so i can protect you" rhetoric
According to this Turkey has 47
You had me at chai
I don't think it is less than 10%, but it certainly is lower than 50%. It seems more like 15-20%
My guess would be around 5% goes topless in private beaches owned by hotels
At least it was more common to see topless 10+ years ago than today
I wouldn’t say there are any woman who dares to do in Public Beaches and some idiot would call the police
In Turkey, i didn't see a single  one sunbathing topless anywhere my whole life
We used to play with legos all the time with my siblings when I was a kid and we weren’t financially great
Sadly, it’s more like an upper class toy now
I’m pretty sure the third one is some drunk Scot swearing at my mom
This video itself is a goldmine but except that, our former First Lady once mixed up "lawmaker" and "lovemaker" while giving a speech
Idk if that counts
The "have you ever had a dream" kid grew up
Who knew
I speech kürsü, one minute
It didnt happened
I swear
They were just playing dead
Nothing kardeş, it's always been fine and orderly in Türkiye
well some armenian stuff
but ragnar was such a cool guy
On which both Greece and Turkey agreed on
Without the exchange, Northern Greece and Western Turkey would have quite a lot of Greek/Turkish-majority areas
I'm not saying it wasn't fucked up, it destroyed families by forced deportation, but I think neither Greece or Turkey wanted to deal with even more racial conflict
It's kind of ironic since Turkey is a nation of genetically mixed Turkic speakers
In my honest opinion, it's a shame we don't have better relations with our neighbor
Considering we lived under the same government (no, I do not consider the Ottoman Empire as Turks in the way modern Turkish people are) in the same geography, there clearly is a shared culture, not to mention our phenotypes being virtually identical
Talking to Greek people abroad gave me a more familiar feel than I expected
For example, it's not that Greeks are stealing Turkish food, they've genuinely been cooking the same food alongside us
That being said, Greeks and Turks get along much better face to face than what you might see on the internet or politics
It's sort of an inside joke at this point
Nevruz
Basically the Indo-Iranian spring and fertility celebrations
[Hıdırellez] the coming of spring on 5-6 May
In the city it's not celebrated as much but the people in our neighborhood at least light a bonfire that we jump over for good health
Also we leave a wish on or under a rose bush that night, then take that wish the next morning and drop it in water
There's also the tradition of the evil eye where people use a nazar amulet for protection from jealous people or bad luck
You can see it on buildings or on people, most often children
The ones you wear look like [this]
I think it's fine, sometimes protection isn't the sole reason
We have a nazar themed decoration on our wall at home and it's mostly there to look pretty
It's not a very serious thing :)
A Turk who doesnt  like tea
A Turk who doesn't drink tea
A Turk that does not eat yogurt/drink ayran(drink made of yogurt)
Unless they have lactose intolerance
Same for a given Turkish person, I guess
Turkish tea in particular
What was Wenger doing, bringing on Walcott that early
Turkish doesn't have a gender system but in Turkish mythology/fairy tales, the Moon is usually depicted as an elderly man while the Sun is depicted as a young woman
Grammatical gender doesn't exist in Turkish language
There are no articles such as der, die, le, la etc
He-she distinction also doesn't exist
As far as I know Hungarian and Finnish are the same
Turkish has no grammatical gender, however in Turkic mythology Moon is male (Ay Ata) and Sun is female (Gün Ana)
It's just Ay (Moon), and Güneş (Sun)
We don't use "the".
Our words aren't gendered
He/she, her/him are the same word in Turkish
But in the old Turkish religion, god of the moon (Ay ata = father/grandfather moon) was a man and the goddess of the sun (Gün ana = mother day) was a woman
No gendered articles in Turkish
That concept is alien to Turkish speakers
turkic mythology\*
He/She/It is just "O".
Yeah Suleiman’s and Fatih’s periods are considered golden age
in 2008, i was 13 back then
my family decided to let me go to the UK all alone for a language school in summer
i got lost at heathrow airport, i followed my gut feelings and called my parents since i got so scared at that moment
they told me to "find my way" and they hung up the phone, i eventually cried more lol
thank goodness i found my way though
when i think back i think it's stupid but it's kinda reasonable since i was 13 with no guided teacher whatsoever
i was also robbed and harassed in lugano, switzerland a couple years ago, that memory still doesn't go away from me though
that man had the audacity to kiss me from my cheek and grop me IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET while robbing me
gross
the last one got me especially and the strange thing is that police didn't even care so i really had to let it go, it's so sad but nevertheless switzerland is lovely
after that time i started to be more cautious since i often travel alone
agreed
it's not your fault, no problem after all
no place is perfect so, besides that event i loved switzerland
In my city
A few months ago there was a nuclear material trade
In my local park some mafia tried to get his hand on enriched uranium
In that night police came and subdued the material
They handed 389 million euro worth of material to usa embassy
My town is a little student town next to the university of 27000 damned souls
Recently our local municipality decided to greet new student with a billboard at the entrance of the town
The thing is one of the people in this said billboard is none other than Selena Gomez photoshopped into wearing a turban
No one knows why they did that
Why they picked Selena Gomez And why made her wearing a turban
We are not sure what is real anymore
Send help
[The billboard ]
Datça is very beautiful
But it is kinda hard to get to so tourists dont really go there
It also has a beautiful ancient city called Knidos
It depends on your field and where you're working
Africa
French
Latin America
Spanish/Portuguese
Central Asia or the Caucasus
Russian
Well, most of secular Muslim countries drink alcohol
Yes, and I don't think any of us thinks that they are Nazi
Yeah, same
It's an obvious political exaggeration
Do you seriously think that Erdoğan believes what he said
And yes, after he said that some Erdoğan supporters could believe that but it is nothing more than 'Germany bad', actually
When someone reads your comment he or she could think that some people in Turkey really belive Germany is still ruled by Nazis or something
(That's what I did understand) Maybe you can change it to " Germany is accused of behaving like Nazi by Turkish President
There is not most hated but we can give a list
For Me:  Erdogan&Adnan Menderes
For Nationalists: II
Abdulhamid (most of the islamist leaders)
For Islamist: Atatürk (he enden caliphate and declared secularism)
For Commies: Every Ottoman sultan, all nationalst parties and also all of the political leaders turkey ever had
For Europeans and half of the Turkey: Erdogan
For Pakistan, Egypt and arabic states: Also Ataturk
For Liberals: All Coup Leaders
For humanists and armenians: Enver Pasha
Sultan 6
Mehmed, Vahdettin is hated because of his collobration with allies
Atatürk probably
Islamists hate him a lot
(He made Turkey a secular state, demolished caliphate and modernized Turkey
) to them, he basically make people irreligious, changed the "magnificent"(!) alphabet and westernised country
everyone except Islamists love Atatürk
(Me too)
as a turk all coup leaders is bad
+add me to
for all you confused people out there, islamists and muslims arent the same people
Nah 60's one was good also it was necessery in 80's the stupidity of the politicians caused the coup
Fair enough
What about Metaxas
I personally like him since he criticed the asia minor campaign
Happy cake day
i think democracy is best way . if people elect bad president ,this is fate of people
army cant invade politics
kanka bence halk kotu lider secsede onlarin kaderi ordu karismamalj her şeye
eskiden ordunun siyasete karismasi gibi sacma bi dusunce vardi 5 cumhurbaskani darbeciydi 12 mart falan ... belki fahri Korutürk yerine cok iyi bi lider geçecekti bunlar ulkeye hizmet yapmadi geregince bence
Totally right for "the Republic of Turkey" but about todays "Sultanate of Erdogan" i can't say same
Aga tabiki demokrasi en iyisi
Tüm darbeler ülke yatışınca demokrasiye devrettiler zaten
Ülkedeki karışıklıktan dolayı seçimde net iyi bir liderin geçeceğini ise hiç sanmıyorum halk tamamen bloklaşmıştı. Darbe elbette iyi bir şey değildir ancak ülkedeki aşırı siyasi kutuplaşmanın bizi götüreceği yer daha da kötüdür. 80 darbesini ben de pek sevmem 80 anayasası aşırı katı idi çünkü ancak 60 darbesini canı gönülden desteklerim
60 anayasası Türkiye Cumhuriyeti tarihindeki en özgürlükçü anayasaydı.
Grammar is hard, really hard, unless u are Hungarian
Pronunciation is also hard too
Its difficult for a lot of people to pronounce letter like ö, ü ı and especlcialy ğ. Germans can easily pronounce this letters but u can hear that they are not Turkish by their accents
Turkish is a soft language
And if an Italian or Spanish would speak Turkish they would sound like a Turkish person if they can handle our letters
Turkish is a non-indoeuropean language so for Europeans,learning turkish can be difficult
I haven't a non-native friend but in TV shows there are many foreign person and they really can speak fluent turkish but still you can probably understand that he/she is foreigner
Happy cake day
agglutinating for life bro !!
Yeap, a lot of our words also similar
For example Elma in Turkish and Alma in Hungarian
And for your information, we view Hungarians as our brothers
We all come from the same place
We are all children of Atilla
Love Hungary
That its agglutinative language
Its the most important thing that people with indo european language group struggle with
You can express a lot of things just by one word
For example göremedik is we couldnt see it
You must learn the parts that you add to the ending of the words
But if you learn that its very easy
We are not related with Hungarians we only lived closely in Asia
We VIEW them as brother
We come from the same place(ASIA)
Asia is pretty big you know its the biggest continent and Hungarians dont realy consider us brothers anyways so no reason to consider them as our brothers
Kardeşim neden bişey bulmaya çalışıyosun
Yazdım gitti tamam boşver
Yes but I don’t think we can while people are working 6 days a week for 12 hours a day for minimum wage
Turkish Economy is not at its peek thus this developments will not change by then
But this can be implemented to many areas with low circulation of people
For example universities
They work around 40-48 hours a week
No, but other Turks might like the idea
Friday is the 'sacred day' for Islam
So having free time on Friday would make it easier to go to the mosque for certain lot
Sorry for what we did
It's not in the example, but I think it fits the question
Turkish and Azerbaijani are quite similar
As a Turkish, I can understand at least 90% of an Azerbaijani text, but it's tiring because of their slightly different alphabeth and some of different words
It sounds like a heavy Eastern accent when listening
It's harder to understand (max 50%, but it's personal)
However, people say you can get the language few ours after landing to the Azerbaijan
As I heard, while listening Azerbaijanis understand Turkish easier than we understand Azerbaijani
Our news channels are in love with Trump and few minutes are reserved everyday about “Trump did/said X” and it’s the most comical part of the news
Usually it was only military activity and the important stuff
US navy hits Syria, gay marriage is allowed etc
Ever since Trump, its every fucking thing
Also they air a lot of footage of Americans being ignorant, not wearing masks and shit, so people here can feel better about themselves
I read the news a lot so more than daily, but between daily and weekly on TV
Not as much as other commenters but I figure that’s because there’s so much going on in our own country
Daily I think
Even if there is nothing big to report, it’s usually an “american cops murdered a black guy again”. Takes the heat off our own murderous cops if nothing else
Everytime
Your president is not stoping
Even in the elections your politicians msking us a propaganda vehicle
For me as a Turk Trump is not a bad president in the outer layers he seems outspoken against middle-eastern terrorism and Chinese influence games
Those are things I hate especially the CCP but Trump then talks incredibly tough but does a worse job than Obama
It’s unbelievable how much influence China gained during his rule while it was literally one of his focuses to stop them
Also you know we got our guy which might not seems as dumb as Trump but he certainly caused as much pain and suffering to our nation as Trump did to yours
I wish Erdo was little more comical but he is just cringy with his cat moustache
Greece and Russia
We came fam
Wait no more
Hello γείτονας :)
I'd say greece and belgium
oh why Turkey
We are Hunnic brothers aren't we :(
Not rivals
Even the most of the islamists are hating them
There is a little racism issue towards arabians specially syrians
Belgium ?We never went to war with them except ww1 we went to war with russia like 13 times
I wasn't talking abaout wars but yeah you're right
oh well bruh
But times have chaned,Suleiman is dead and we love Hungary more than ever
All of our unsuccesfull students go to your country to study medicine for instance lol
It's the actual battle royale that you're fighting against all of balkan states and your own goverment as well
Well there was no historical rivalry between Belgium and us but the Russia is the main guy who killed Ottoman
We, at least, all my friend doesn’t go anywhere but to bed to sleep
It is uncommon to sleep in shower or bathtub
Also we have 3 draining system
One on bottom of shower or bathtub, one on higher on bathtub for preventing over flown and last is in floor for if over flown happens can prevent spreading into house
I'm sorry but modern European cities are never attractive to me
I'm not going to name cities but a city with lots of big buildings are just not worth visiting imo
On the other hand, modern cities that kept their historical look are the best
When they visit İstanbul, they usually only see the historical peninsula
European side has so much more to offer than that
And Asian side of the city has some amazing places you don’t wanna miss
Beşiktaş, Kadıköy, Üsküdar all amazing towns
Kadıköy is the most I like about İstanbul yet so few tourists know about it
The historical peninsula is rich I’ll give it that but it’s packed with people so it hammers the experience
It’s crowded, loud and dirty
Although I prefer the European side (212 over 216), Asian side is cleaner and greener in comparison
And not that crowded
So I think they deserve a visit
Let me explain:
Those hotels are usually all inclusive (as in all you can eat+drink)
So, people are psychologically inclined to consume as much as they can, because they already paid for the whole package
And if it's summer, it's just too hot to go outside
I agree that it's stupid though
Also, a lot of food goes to waste because of this system
Kadıköy has nothing on Beyoğlu imo
But istanbul as a whole is becoming more and more ugly everyday
Back in mid-2000s it was absolutely gorgeous
Now it hurts me to look at the city knowing how it used to be
Istanbul's center is all historic
The mass of skyscrapers are away from the city's center
So I wouldn't count Istanbul as one of those cities
But Ankara is one of them
It doesn't have anything
It used to be just a small town in Ottoman times so there's nothing but buildings
Beyoğlu can be partially considered in the historical peninsula
And it’s becoming more and more ugly everyday as you say
Eh, I enjoy Kadıköy more too
It is the designated part of the city for progressives, after all
But it has nothing that makes you feel like you are living Istanbul
It’s very generic
Only in Beyoğlu you are able to leave a lgbt bar at 4-5 am with your friends to walk in a crowded İstiklal filled with *all* kinds of people, so that you can get some ıslak burger
Surrounded by old, beautiful architecture and new, ugly stores
That’s Istanbul
Like, I’m sure I would be having more fun in Dubai or Las Vegas for example but Sintra is a lot more beautiful
Napoli and Marrakesh stink of piss so much that it hurts to breathe walking the streets, but to me if you prefer Dubai over Marakesh, I find your taste buds inferior to mine
Kadıköy is a lot better than Dubai, though
And in the end all of İstanbul is ugly
It’s 5 mil max capacity city occupied by more than 15 mil
So that’s to be expected
Pezevenk is a pimp in Turkey, but it's something like a brave/fatherly figure in Azerbaijan
(or a businessman) There's a very well known story regarding this, when the Azerbaijani President visited Turkey in the 90's, he called the Turkish President "my pezevenk brother" (my pimp brother) in his speech during a state dinner and the Turkish President responded saying "Siz de az pezevenk değilsiniz" (You're not less of a pimp yourselves)
Azmak is "to get lost" in Azerbaijani Turkish, "to get horny" in Turkish
Düşmek (Düşmək in Az
) means "to fall" in Turkish, but it's something like "to land" in Azerbaijan
So "uçak düştü" means "the plane fell down" in Turkey, but it's "the plane landed" in Azerbaijan
Also "başa düşmək" is an idiom in Azerbaijani Turkish which is something like  "to understand/realize" But the idiom doesn't exist in Anatolian Turkish - so when you say "başa düştüm" it literally means "I fell on the head".
It was extremely confusing watching an English cooking video before learning "pasta" didn't mean "cake" in English
Meme in English  : an image, video, piece of text, etc
, typically humorous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by Internet users, often with slight variations
Meme in Turkish  : Boobs
Pasta:
Turkish: Birthday cake
English: Variously shaped dough products such as penne, linguini and so on
Snake/Sinek (Sound similiar):
Turkish: Fly
English: Long limbless reptile
It:
Turkish: Dog
English: A thing
Argh I have a ton but now you ask I can’t think of any
I wouldn't want to leave Turkey, but it looks like I'll have to due to the economy + being trans
I cant say that I do
There are a lot of problems here
Corruption, fake media, politics etc
I of course with that those problems will end
I really wish that one day I can say that I want to live in my country, but for now, no
I would probably want to move to nordic countries
I am kinda afraid too
As a Turk we face a lot of racism for things that we did not do
People hate us just because they know our government and judge us by them
I don't like living and yes, low incomes due to taxes and our money valuse is so low compared to 10 years ago, if it was like 10 years ago, I would consider it but now no
Plus the feel of being freedom is much more less compared to earlier years, there are much more reasons, like bad education system, increasing religion life style over poor areaes while youngs and young adults aren't interested religion at all
Etc
For people to compare, Renault clio 2020 cheapest 119
900 TL which is 15600 euros, and also the lowest income for workers is 2500 TL so you need to work around 50 months to get a new car
I dunno what to say if even you guys' winters are lack of snow
I probably shouldn't complain about snowless winters in Istanbul
it is rough to leave the place you were born and grew up in yes, but it is preferable to working a dead-end job
I'm thinking either Canada or Belgium, but nothing solid yet
Maybe I won't leave after all, I'll see what Turkey turns to in the next few years
I'm glad you liked Turkey though :)
Out of politics, maybe the best
Because Turkey is located between Balkans, Mediterranian, Black Sea, Middle East and Caucasus combined
You can see so much climate types in here
You don't even need to leave country unless you wanna have a different kind of cultural trip
But with politics, Turkey is a hell which is stuck between Middle East and Balkans geographically
Just think about that, i'm saying Balkans aand Middle East
This is Hellception
I wish we were somewhere more west but still in the Mediterranean area, that's far from Syria lol
too much action happening in a short period of time
1 turkish week equals 6 european months
i used to get bored a lot when i was living in japan
i feel alive again after a long period of time
to the west: the Balkans
to the east: the Caucasus
to the south: the Middle East
I'll have another location thank you very much, although the climate isn't bad
It would be nice if there weren’t so much action
If something happens in our neighbours, it effects us as well
And something always happens
Our internal affairs are also a mess
Apart from that it’s nice to have Black Sea by the north, Aegean by the west, Mediterranean by the south and Marmara in the middle
There’s just so much variety to choose from
The sea, the lakes, mountains, plateaus, historical places, the sun, the rain, the snow
We have them all
Not to mention that long range of variety is applied in gastronomy too
It would be an amazing place to live without all the bullshit
German influenced Alsace
More like extremely French influenced  Elsaß.
Turkey is a really hard country to understand
Inside and outside are really different
You have to live here for like 8 yrs (that makes 2 elections, ya know) at least to understand the whole politic groups of the country
We tried to get a democratic rule first in 1950 and the elected government ended most of the Kemalist revolutions
Then Kemalist military coup happened in 1960 and everything started to get out of control with the Soviet pressure and influence at the same time
The point is, Kemalist revolutions didnt come from bottom
They came from the top, from an elitist community to the standard people
But that is the characteristic of Turkish nation
We worship to our state
Dont rebel against it just like French or other Latin nations do
All coups in Ottoman/Turkish history, came from an elitist community
(last coup not included, they were islamist/gulenist)
Edit:But i'm sure that if Atatürk could live like 15 more yrs, then Turkey would be a paradise nowadays
>that makes 2 elections, ya know
Not anymore
Calling Gulenists Islamists is fucking laughable and there was really no evidence that they did it
tbh, its hard to survive here for 1k years
10 yrs* XD
Well, dont make it that obvious, seems like you are one of them
You can ask every single opposer or AKP supporter in Turkey "Are Gulenists Islamist
" and they will answer it like "Hell, sure" or "This is not real Islamism" XD
Demanding evidence doesn't mean I'm one of them
Yeah that's because they also hate the Gulen movement
only (old) gulenists dont hate from gulenists in turkey, i dont need to prove that to anyone
it is the most true thing in the whole universe probably
Couldn’t have said it better
In most places they aren't really popular
I haven't seen one in Istanbul
In villages they are more popular but still not that popular
I've seen a couple Lada Nivas in my mother's hometown
My uncle is living in the US and had his daughter (who is 1 year older than me) there
As such, even though she is now much more accustomed to the way things are here, my cousin was like a foreigner in Turkey
They come here every summer and her mother came too this one time (her parents are divorced)
However, her mum is a complete foreigner
She was running in a park near our house and then entered the house with her running shoes on
She was saying something to us while on the most white and expensive carpet in the house; both me and my mum were in shock
We find it rude to tell guests what they should do, so we didn't tell her what was wrong
I don't think she did that again though, she probably realised her mistake after seeing my cousin take off her shoes
Other worst part is that after coming back from living where they give away the road for pedestrian
This is how I am going to die
How in hell did she hold herself back from the terlik, I get how she's a guest but I mean the terlik is pretty much a reflex
Oh, taxi drivers in Turkey
It is usually kind of a jokely plead
They are just trying to feel more comfortable by putting you in a dangerous situation
Thats how we do it
Not a child's story but commonly assigned for kids to read: Kaşağı.
The name translates as currycomb (horse comb) and it's about a gorgeous currycomb of a wealthy family
The kids are not allowed to touch it and kids being kids, one if them takes it and combs the rocks, the well, everything
The comb is messed up and when the dad sees this, he angirly asks who did it
Scared, the kid slanders his younger brother
The father beats him up so bad that he dies sometime later
The kid regrets his actions but has to live with it
Erdogan well
He is very tall and has the biggest body mass of them all and well
No one is corrupt as he is
And carries m1 garand by his side in a briefcase
Is there a selection where I can choose I am forced to don’t belong and fit to country that I was born into
People in Turkey are very friendly
For example, you can have a short chat even when buying bagels from a peddler on the side of the road on your way to school
and people gather in cafes and chat
I remember my 7th grade English teacher from the UK telling me this lol
Can I be a part of your family
Gagauz, Azerbaijanian, Crimean Tatar are pretty easy
With some effort Salar and Turkmen are understandable too
One could also get the gist of a text in Uzbek
Gagauz is interesting as well
I found it quite similar to rural Turkish spoken in the Black Sea coast when I was there
They even say "haçan" while talking
Meanwhile Cyprus turkish sounds like they stopped when they reached the peak 60s era turkish movie dialects
I find it very satisfying and cute
Ah great
Got a question then, I'm aware of two theories about their origins
One states that they are the descendants of Izzettin Keykavus's tribe, thus the name comes from Keykavus and becomes Gagauz
Another one simply states that the word is a form of Gök Oğuz (Blue/Celestial Oghuz)
Could any of these be true
Or is there a third theory about the origins of the Gagauz
Ah thanks a lot
And indeed it seems to be quite uncertain
Our love for tea
No matter your ethnicity, religion or language
If you're from Turkey, you just lay back
And enjoy some tea with friends and family
Dancing in weddings
But not your regular dances nor specifically folk
Doesn’t matter how rich you are, or how elegant reception you want, there’s always gonna be oyun havası or halay
I don’t want that kind of music in my future wedding if it ever happens, but I know I’ll make it so because otherwise my relatives would eat me alive
Erik Dalı is the absolute worst imo
It's because Turkish Coffee is famous around the world
We introduced it to Europe after all
Tea can be consumed at any time of the day in Turkey
During breakfast, after breakfast, with a snack, after dinner etc
Coffee is still widely consumed but It's most of time treated a bit more formally
Like when you have guests, you serve them a cup of Turkish coffee
Or when you are on a date, you drink coffee
We don't drink it everytime, but we still drink it a lot
I've never tasted British Tea and I really wonder what it tastes like
We mean "black tea" when we are talking about tea in here
So any different kind of tea is a complete mystery
I really don’t get the appeal of it
And it’s just one movement repeated over and over
Am I missing something here
The absolute worst about these is your relative that you've never heard of says stuff like "Oturmaya mı geldik
" and makes you play
Respect my privacy a little lan
When someone says British Tea, we think about a yellow/brownish tea in a white mug
Turkish Tea on the other hand is served in a curvy glass and it has more of reddish color
Turkey: Döner Kebap
döner, it means "it spins", and well, it spins
they put some meat around a pole and slowly slice it while it's spinning
there are 2 options: meat and chicken (maybe more but i only know these)
DONER KEBAB
one of my favorites
I hope Turkey is also considered in this sub
It's doner kebab
I think its also pretty popular in Europe
pretty much every Turkish food is a fast food
Özür dilerim but wtf
I thought it was Turkish :)
You mean the one invented in 1972 by Kadir Nurman
Its history is much older than that
On the contrary, it is very common and they're hung for national holidays
Literally every 1 out of 5 people hang the national flag outside of their home
Turkey is a very nationalist country
You'll see people having the flag printed on their cars alongside an Ottoman era "Tughra"(the emperors signature) or the word Turuk(meaning Turk in old Turkish) spelled in old(very old) Turkic runes, you'll see it on trucks, you'll see it hanging from peoples balconies, you'll see a gargantuan flag flying in a clear area of the city
Is it annoying
Not if it is not too much
Not very common outside of national holidays though
Apart from celebrations and government buildings, people rarely hang them
[Morning in Balat]
For Turkey (imo) some would be:
Atatürk introducing the new alphabet to the public
Atatürk has so many famous photos and you can see them everywhere in Turkey, but what makes it so iconic is that this one is not from a war or a ceremony, it's just him writing letters on a chalkboard - it's often used as a depiction of the modernization period and I don't think you can find a modern Turkish history book without this photo
Of course Alan Kurdi, a Syrian child, lying dead on a beach in Bodrum
Hands up, I would say it's probably one of the most iconic photos of the decade
"Seyit Onbaşı" lifting an artillery shell
He's a national hero who sunk a British battleship called HMS Ocean in the Gallipoli campaign
Supposedly, his company was almost wiped out by the gunfire from the ship but he got up after the attack and singlehandedly fired three artillery shells (each weighing around 276 kgs) and sunk the ship
The famous photo is a recreation of that moment, but still it's probably in all history books
"Cumhuriyeti biz böyle kazandık" (This is how we earned the republic) A photo from the republic's ten year anniversary celebrations taken in rural Western Anatolia
There are bureaucrats and villagers holding a sign saying "this is how we earned the republic," as a tribute to hardships beared by villagers during WW1 and the Greco-Turkish War
"Lady in red" from Gezi Park Protests of 2013 - a woman wearing a casual red dress, carrying a shopping bag, and getting pepper-sprayed by the police
Hrant Dink's shabby shoes after his murder
He was a loved Armenian-Turkish journalist and there were huge protests with the slogan "We're all Hrant's, we're all Armenians
" all around Turkey when he was murdered by an ultra-nationalist
"Ekmekli Dede" (literally the grandpa with bread)
An old man (Eşref Cengiz) carrying bread loaves while crying in front of a collapsed building which killed 50 people
It might not be the most iconic photo overall, but it's always the first photo the media uses when a natural disaster happens
The picture was taken moments after 1999's Düzce Earthquake and it was the second massive earthquake in the region in 3 months
The quakes destroyed parts of Istanbul and neighboring cities, killed tens of thousands of people and led to the worst economic crisis in the history of Turkey
A small shop owner throwing a cash register to prime minister Bülent Ecevit during that economic crisis in 2001
It's really, really iconic but it's a 10 second video, so I guess it doesn't count
The protester shouts "Mr
Prime Minister, take this, I'm a shop owner
Any photo of [Mustafa Kemal Atatürk] obivously
The mindset
The only people I've encountered are nationalists and as soon as the conversation gets political they're either supporting the police, standing against gender equality, swearing at an ethnicity or denying a genocide
Besides the most practical things, I really hate that no one in This country cares for aesthetics
No, I am not talking about being pretty or some human shit
I say that about anything else
Our shitty apartment buildings, our shitty parks, our shitty roads
If you go into a house of someone I give it a 90% chance that their living room looks straight out of 2001
And the thing is, they aren't even aware of how bad and outdated it looks
Look
Dont comment at me "but people can't afford shit in Turkey" because I know
But I also know "bad taste" isn't a prerequisite for being poor
A single fucking frame on the wall that has a decent cheap print of art straight out of google images will make your living room look 5x better
Stop white-washing everything
We don't deny anything
The historical facts, the laws, the highest court in EU says otherwise
Make your damn research before you jump the bandwagon
None of the reddit users have the credibility, knowledge and expertise in this area than Bernard Lewis for example
The announcement of the military coup on state television
The commanders doing the coup stormed the state television , and made a reporter read the announcement live, on gunpoint
It was the creepiest thing i have ever seen
Link (its in turkish) [
>Finland is quite a militarized country when compared to other western countries:
Being totally neutral is hard
It has some cost
The reward is that almost nobody call you evil because of a war crime thats a big gain
>The reward is more about not being dragged into someone elses wars
Turkey experienced that in WW2
It is still seen as a wonderful choice by the majority of people
>This might come as a shocker, but neutral countries can still commit war crimes and be called evil
True, but at least you won't be treated same as an invader
In Turkey people use 'arşın' for agriculture measurement and a traditional unit of area unit which is called 'dönüm'.
1 arşın² = 0,57417 m²
1 dönüm (ottoman standard) = 919 m²
1 dönüm (modern standard) = 2720 m²
There are some unusual ones that are not used anymore by the general public like: Urup, Kirah, Cerip that were used in different sectors during the Ottoman period
However units such as ayak (feet) and parmak (fingers) are still taught at elementary education level just to give an understanding of the old school measurement systems to kids
Not at all used afaik but there is “Karış”
Which is the strechted  length of you middle and thumb fingers .
There are two that are still in use afaik
* **Dönüm** - 1,000 square meters
Very commonly used for land
* **Çeki** - 226 kilograms
Only used for measuring wood
Not common

Well, TIL
Agreed on the second part, the whole country is breathtaking
Can I say studying
I mean it is part of culture at the end
Until 7th Grade, I was loving studying learning new stuff everyday, getting better understanding the world, my country, my culture
But Since 7th until end of 2nd year of university
Due to education system, my life just turned into you memorise these so you will be in the best high school in the city
During 6th, 7th and 8th grade, we had to take exams at the end of the year and summary of those number will made up for you to choose high school
Which I was in quite successful one but in this high school, we were forced to chose one type of programme which is similar as classes being chosen in university
We had 3 subjects and one option to each as Math, Balanced and Literature
I have chosen Math because I wanted to be an architect
Which instantly turned out, you have to study Math and Science(Physics, Chemistry and Biology) to get into this university
Which I have to placed in at least 80,000/2,200,000(the year I have taken the class) people to minimum to enter to private university with around 25% to 50% scholarship
So I just studied but not learnt until the exam years
Everyone was trying to learn short cuts but not the actual way to learn it forever
At the end, because i didn’t spend too much time with Turkish Literature I was in 70,000-80,000 which I went to university with 25% scholarship
In these 7 years, I have lost too many time from my teenage years which I would have learnt, practice, change about myself, etc
which has come out at second year of architecture studies where I was used being told what to do which made my worst semester of my education years and let me realise what I have been doing
I have failed 3 important classes that semester
During winter break(ours was 7 weeks long) I have restudied first and second year again to get rid off what I have being doing to succeed
I happy now that I have gotten rid off this part of my past
And still worries me that our education system is worse than when I was studying which was the last years of our highest education have became
After watching Djam I realised how much I love rebetiko too
Thank you
I was and am still enjoying what I am doing
It was a must for me to do it
The worst part is that I will not regain confidence over my decisions until I am sure 100% about it
Old system was designed to progress you but you know someone needed idiotic system for their relatives to pass exams
I don't care what brand, I want Taco restaurant chains
Obviously there aren't any Mexicans living here so there's like only one Taco restaurant per one major city
And they treat tacos as some luxury food so they're expensive as hell
We dont use both of them
We use it as just mail instead
Germany (our ally from WWI)
Russia (Ottoman's enemy for many centuries)
Iran/Persia (we had same ambitions for middle east)
Great Britain (WWI and they always joined our Russia problem)
Greece ( Aegean Islands and Cyprus disputes also population exchange issue)
Byzantium
Austria - Hungary
Russia
France
United Kingdom
1- Central Asian Countries
2- Greece
3- Russia
4- China
5- Not a country, but Islamic history as well
1-East Rome/Byzantine Empire
2-China
3-Russia
4-Generally Arabs
5-South Germans/Hungarians
6-*Allied Powers who tried to invade us after WW1*
7-Iran
Ww1 isn't a big part of Turkish history tho
You should change Germany with China or Austria
It should be higher
If someone were to study our history, they would learn mostly about you guys (counting the eastern roman empire too)
Germany is not relevant except ww1 and studying Turkish history won't reveal much about neither germany nor uk
We are learning about Macedonians, Byzantine and Modern Greece actually
Wow how did you get that idea:) Didn't we establish our republic after ww1 and our history lesson's biggest part is that transition process
But If you say Germany isn't that important yeah maybe you're right
Yes ww1 have a huge role in early modern Turkey but nothing more
At least it's less important than (minimum) 600 year-long Chinese rivalry that caused Islamisation and mass migrations into Anatolia in the first place
Not to mention The Barbarian İnvasion, or first and more than half of our historical data were learned from Chinese sources
I mean belgium did not ban it just legally declared it gambling thus should be subject to gambling regulations which is very fair
Gacha games are notoriously played by tees who are very vulnerable to developing addictions
As long as the game has proper system to check if the person is adult or not and discloses the loot box rates publicly its fine tho
Year 3020, Turkey is still on the negotiation table to join EU
I'd say the European Union would be limited to Northwest and Central Europe(and Scandinavia)
Southern Europe would break apart and be in a never-ending economic crisis, while the Balkans have cycles of jingoism and relative stability as always
A stagnating Russia will be cautiously holding onto the Caucasus and parts of Eastern Europe
Turkey and Greece barking at each other without bite
Essentially the status quo with lower birthrates and economic instability
I'd say India, China or CANZUKUS would be the main power
No one is delusional enough to think we’ll ever join
But yeah, we still are candidates
Sanctions would actually might increase his influence on conservatives because they already think western nations are out to get them
It can go the other direction too of course or we might even see some sort of civil war in the next elections if polarisation grows bigger
I don’t even know anymore
I’m afraid this might make things much worse for us than just economically
I feel hopeless
I think the majority leans on pro-EU
People used to voice their wishes louder but now we don’t think we’ll be able to join at this current state, so it’s not really talked about other than a meme here and there
Now that I think about it, even the memes cooled off
I can only hope we’ll be a worthy member in the future but we have a lot to go before that happens
Most people say something like this lately and if Atatürk could see us today, he would tell us to stop waiting for someone else to save us and start changing the situation ourselves
We had our special meme genre and template called *caps* in 2010s. It was basically a red bar under the image and some text
It was pretty popular for a couple years
Fugg :DDDDDD
We also have uncle that plays with card and slaps it at the table
Inci caps, ah good old days lol
We have nice rivalry with Greece
Our culture is very similar and only religion divides us
Other than that I think we are very close with Azerbaijan and we call Northern Cyprus "our baby homeland".
Azerbaijan for sure
In fact, we call each other "two countries but one nation"
Most people would say Azerbaijan, i agree too but i am going to say Greece, we both hate and love them, its complicated
Even if we fought for years, i always saw Greece as our brother, kind of like a sibling rivalry
The fact that our culture was developed together always made me feel closer to Greek people
There's a saying we use for Azerbaijan: "Tek millet, iki devlet
" which means "One nation, two state
So yeah, it's Azerbaijan
Spain is my dream country to live
Weather is the same, people are warm like us
You also have such a beautiful culture
I don’t think I can survive most of Europe’s climate
I wouldn’t even think to call us brothers but wouldn’t you agree calling it disgusting is a little disrespectful
Yes, but it is considered “yavru vatan” - “offspring/child homeland”
So it is seen as a child of Turkey, the relationship is more paternal than fraternal
In any case I do not consider TRNC a sovereign state so even if most Turks considered it the brother country, I wouldn’t write it here
>Isn't Azerbaijan in Asia
Does it matter
TRNC is getting quite assertive in its domestic politics
So I guess the relationship might become more equal even without a solution to the Cyprus problem
IIRC they even pondered establishing their own military
Of course I’d wish for an united Cyprus in an ideal world though
Je comprends l'Espagnol le mieux, surtout à l'oral, l'İtalien plus a l'écrit
Quand au Roumain et Portugais c'est même pas la peine d'essayer y a que quelques mots par-ci par-là j'arrive a comprendre
Même si elles sont toutes très loin d'être facile pour moi
During the first night after the marriage, where the couple is expected make love; the groom's male friends slap him in the back before he enters the house/bedroom to somehow motivate the poor guy
It only happens in rural towns
There were news where this slapping went too far and the groom had to go to a hospital
Yeah
I'd have a red St
George's Cross over a blue background with a white Byzantine double-headed eagle at the center
I’m not a fan of crescent and star because of its religious meaning
It would be fine without the context behind it though
I also like the colours red and white
i think greek flag is one of the nicest among the world "komşu"(neighbour)
I like the Turkestan flag
Keep the star and crescent but make the colour blue
i think our flag kinda looks arabic with star and cresent and i know that it's not about islam at all
maybe göktürk style flag would be more fitting ideally idk
Definitely No
Even if you are 50 years old and lost your home, job, etc
the moment you mentioned something like this, your room will be ready in couple mins
Even if you are working and staying with your family, they will never ask anything like this until they need your help
Otherwise if they can, they will even help you save money that you worked for
*ENGLAND*
Yes, I moved out of my mothers house at 17 to live with my girlfriend and her grandparents
We were financially independent even at that age so of course we paid them some rent money
Not as much as a normal tenant would pay but just some to help out so we weren’t taking the piss
The difference is whether or not the adult you are living with owns their own house or not - if they don’t and pay rent then they probably could do with a little extra rent money to keep them going
Lmao
But why not saving some of it for their school expenses when they are old enough to go
Or something closer
Cats, whose native land is Turkey, in general and [Tombili the Cat] in particular
We have wolf
It comes from the First Turkic Khaganate
The Hagia Sophia Cat: Gli
She is a 16 year old cat and i think she recently got sick because she is so old
She was even petted by Barack Obama
No actually wolf is more turkish
Name one Turkish wolf
I hear comparisons to either Japanese or Latin languages
Which is fair because I agree
Well, yes
But at least it's not French
Well no offense but when I was in Poland it was sound like buzz
Yep
We all suffer from constant toothache anyway
Thank you to Greece
Even if we don’t talk or get along much(government size)
I am happy that we share things
I wish we were as used to be
But I hope in future
Thank you Poland for being Erasmus Capital for Turkish students
Germany
Glad to hear that
Thank you
Finally
Thanks for the shout out
It's very relieving to hear some gratitude after all
I understand you so much
Same in Turkey
I've never locked a door
Same in here, Turkey

The downfall of the value of the Lira, Erdogan telling a guy who was complaining about low wages to "go and drink tea", Erdogan's son-in-law saying something along the lines of "Let them eat cake"
We are still in the summer in October
It's like 30°C when It's noon
Penalty of living in a beach city
Damn, if Marie Antoinette heard these shits, she would definitely die from jealousy
It really is lol
Helped that he literally gave a box of tea leaves at the man afterwards
"The shopkeeper continued his words by saying that he cannot *bring bread home
* Erdogan responded by saying that it sounded very exagerrated
The shopkeeper then said 'The service sector is in a terrible state
We're in a poor position'. Erdogan told him to "Drink this tea" and gave him tea
Depends on the field of study
Istanbul Technical University, Middle East Technical University and Boğaziçi are probably the most prestigious ones in engineering
Istanbul and Ankara Universities are the most prestigious ones for law degrees
(+Galatasaray University but the language of education is French) Istanbul University (with 2 different campuses) and Hacettepe are the best in Medicine, while Boğaziçi University is the best in positive and social science degrees
But these are all free public universities and private universities like Koç, Sabancı and Bilkent are decent in most fields since they provide more opportunities than public schools most of the time
Istanbul university, Istanbul technical university, ODTÜ, Hacettepe university, Bilkent univercity
2 of these are in top 500 and others are in top 1000 universities in the world
Slovakia
No offence, but it
never comes up in news or anything
It's just there
Same with Liechtenstein
Historically, Poland wasn't around much though
Very sorry, just joking
Peach
It has the same pronouncation with "piç" in turkish which means bastard
The word peach sounds a lot like piç,which means bastard, in Turkish
A Turk commend replied with a Polish Commend
I could get vienna flashback anymoment now
Well i'll put the canons back to the garage than
Enough corrupt that you can’t ask where the earthquake taxes went since 2000(Around 30B-40B€)
Woman who asked it already under investigation
Enough corrupt that you can get more jail time just to criticise government officials than actually killing people
Enough corrupt to burn a forest to built a hotel
Resulted people to create a campaign to reforest that area right after news
Enough corrupt to changing every head state department people with support of government’s party which resulted TÜBİTAK(Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) to not to support projects which couple of months later that project wins internationally awards
This is how we lost our scientist and this is why Erdogan called our scientist to return Turkey
He promised to create same conditions
Enough corrupt that people who support AKP took crazy high amount of money from government to do job which can be done 75-80% less money if it went to another cooperation
Result was after local elections cities that changed to CHP gave out information about how most of the cities about to bankrupt
Enough corrupt that government sided TV Channel asked earthquake survivors who have to live in tent, who knows how long, this question repeatedly “Are you happy
”. They just lost their home
They just become homeless after 20 secs of earthquake
Only thing they have is blankets, a heater works with coal or wood and teapot under a tent
Reporter tries force to make them say “I am happy”.
Enough corrupt that Türk Kızılayı (Turkish Red Crescent) asks for money right after earthquake (10₺ =1,6€) to help earthquake area while they tossed tons of stuff to Syrians without asking money
This shows how AKP values more to Arabs than Turks
While Arabs didn’t call us for condolences but, even if we don’t have nice relations lately, our neighbour Greece was the one who called us right after as well as EU next
So yes, Turkey is corrupt by government side
If you are individual, you won’t see any corruption at all unless you come a cross with people who support government
edit: a word, grammar
In our country half our debt comes from refugees and other comes corruption
Everything is corrupt here in Turkey
a LOT
Economy has gone to shit, we have that dude named Erdoğan which you all know very well, more than half of turkey is currently supporting him
I just wanna leave here, HELP
>Το Ζεϊμπέκικο της Ευδοκίας by Manos Loizos
This is what come to my mind when I think of Greece
It is awesome
I would vote [this song] for Iran
>hope for peace
Yes, always
> BTW we love your music
It is nice to hear that
Btw your suggestion is awesome too
Only that the song I vote is the first come to my mind
Europeans that live in larger cities, can you describe the life in your city
Ah i wish that would take that much for me
I am considered to live close to my school but even that takes at least 45 minutes to go to with public transportation
Oh im really sad that they act like that
Im not suprised tho :/
I would say in Europe standarts cities with 300k+ populations are considered larger cities
But if you live in a city that is considered large only in your country you can still share your experiences i think
Yeah i relate to this
I hope our situation gets better as well
Happy cake day
Lisbon kinda felt like Istanbul to me when I had the chance to visit it
I wasn’t expecting it so it was a nice surprise
The trams especially make it very similar
It’s like a part of Istiklal street from early 00’s.
Bilecik does not exist
Do not listen to propaganda
Have you ever met someone from Bilecik
Exactly
The government is feeding you lies
Somebody already did French monarques so Turkey:
Süleyman, Mehmet, Osman, Selim, Murat, Beyazıt, Orhan
From the sultanate of rum(Anatolian Seljuks): Kılıçarslan, Alparslan
If you go earlier like VI-VIIIth century you have: Bumin, Ashina, Özmiş, Ishbara, Ilig, Qutlugh
(don't know if these really count tho)
About Dora, she teaches English here too
Modern cartoons do to this too much, but in 70-90s localizing the characters names were not so rare with the most known example being popeye characters
(Popeye-Temel reis Bluto-Kabasakal\[lit
rude beard\] Olive-Safinaz)
One of my favourites is Spaceship enterprise vs Atılgan(doesn't have a direct translation, has meaning between adventuresome and aggressive)
Luckily they don't do this nowadays
This is kind of odd to see
In Turkey, as far as I can remember, Dora just teaches Turkish
I always saw it as one of the shows targeted at 1-2 y/o’s because of how primitive it’s language was
Menemen is a Turkish dish, usually eaten for breakfast, which is made of eggs, tomato, green pepper, and (debatably) onion
Whether the onion should be added or not is a very polarizing topic, as you can see [here]
Should pickles be made with lemon juice or vinegar
How  [Menemen] is made
There are two kinds of Turks, people who put onions in, and people that are wrong
Lol same for Turkey we call our omelette "Menemen"
No onion menemen is not menemen, just tomato with eggs
Menemen lacks its soul without onions
Not at all, it's usually eaten straight from the pan with bread
Its name comes from the town [Menemen]
Tembel hayvan (Sloth) = Lazy animal
Köpek balığı (Shark) = Dog fish
Peygamberdevesi (Mantis) = Camel of prophet
Yalıçapkını (Kingfisher) = Womaniser of the
waterside mansion
Eşek arısı (Wasp) = Donkey bee
Devekuşu (Ostrich) = Camel bird
Denizanası (Jellyfish) = Mother of the sea
Sivrisinek (Mosquito) = Sharp fly
**"Ankara'nın Bağları" and "Erik Dalı Gevrektir"**
They are the examples of the most shitty, tortural, and low-class genre in the country
However, these two become really famous and loved by many people
Even there are videos of some Spanish people dancing with it
(what
**"Ankara'nın Bağları"** was my highscool bell-tone:'( **"Erik Dalı Gevrektir"** played in every hour in the bus when I was in a touristic trip
Definitely the new airport in Istanbul - poor transport, there are problems with weather and it costed much, much more than renovating Ataturk Airport would have
Nope
People don't care about it here
Probably due to there being no confirmed cases of the coronavirus
We haven’t have this Coronavirus Panic, yet
But in 2016 Coup, I remember my father have taken a lot of cash in case of there was ban for going out
No, we still pretend that there are no corona cases here
And can someone please explain why toilet paper of all things is the first thing that runs out in a panic situation
Is it because everyone is so food secure but anally obsessed or they don't know of any other way than paper to clean themselves if they need
merak means curiosity in turkish
Satılmış. It literally translates to "Sold
" What kind of a monster would give this name to their child
durmuş (it stopped)
In Turkey the worst name is Murtaza lmao
but why
Why are they bad
It probably stems from rendez-vous, right
I had no idea so I checked Wikipedia and the only international thing I could find was military bands
Al Jazari invented suciton pumps in the 12th century
Also the first air travel was done by Evliya Çelebi in the 17th century
Sword and drum machine also originate in Turkey
Well, Turkish ancestors who used to live in the geographic area of where Turks live now, did invent them
In turkish its röntgen too, weird
Wow swedes be smart
Bologna process was a huge step
ECTS enabled comparing credits very easily
That sucks but isn't that the university's fault
Mount and Blade series
Maybe Crysis games because the founders of Crytek are Turkish but everyone else are German
Mount & Blade series is probably the most popular one
That’s how you know a game is good
I would like to thank Greece for being there for us in our bad days decpite being our main rival country
When we had a huge earthquake Greece was the first country to send help
When Greece was occupied by Germany Turkey sent food and supplies to our Greek friend
We might be rivals, but we will always be there for each other
Love Ellada from Türkiye
I would like to thank Greece for always being there for a light hearted tease
Oh we are in the schengen area finally
Şalgam (shalgam) is a salty, sometimes spicy drink made from radish
Usually consumed with red meat
Ayran is specific to Turkey too, i guess
And Iran maybe
It is yoghurt with water and salt
Also we make Cornelian Cherry juice (got to look the fruit's English) here, it is pretty good
Ayran, yogurt water with salt basically but tasty really good with chicken meals or doner
Şalgam Suyu: Turnip Juice
Mix of water, turnips, black carrots, salt and garlic
Hot peppers if you want it to be hot
It has a bitter taste and It's most of the time consumed with fish
Not everyone might like it
Ayran: This one is more popular
It's basically yoghurt with some water and salt
It's the best friend of döner kebab
It's really tasty
Russians calling beer a soft drink always make me smile
Don’t forget [boza]
Should have remembered that there are a lot of döner restaurants around the world lol
Wouldn't say disgusting but agreeable overall haha
Wow, awesome
Same, out of 138 subs, only one of them is Turkish
I hope one day we could talk and make jokes, too, about who-must-not-be-named
We have one rn, its not taboo but you can get your ass to the jail if you do talk too much bout it
English because I like English as a language a lot
Some of the stuff you meant to hear and understand are also only understandable in English as it would lose its meaning in, say, Turkish
Besides, playing in English allows you to learn words or phrases you might have never heard of before
Not to mention voice acting
Definitely English
It makes it easier to communicate with foreign teammates and also it's hard to find reliable translations for Turkish
Always in English
Even my Steam is in English
Playing games in Turkish just feels weird
I prefer to experience everything originally
Whether it be games or books or movies
If I have the ability to experience something as it should be, I do
my language
English bcz the original is always better
No matter if they are games/films/books
Tea brotherhood
Very few
Even less so with voice acting
Nope total war and mount and blade series has the turkish language but it's quite uniqe to see a turkish translation
I wouldnt say few, a lot of games have Turkish subtitles on PC(mostly indie games) and PS4
If there isn't a offical turkish subtitle, almost always there is a 3rd party patch/mod for it
But i agree, i also use English for every game except Mount&Blade
Unfortunately, most of them are generalized and viewed as conservative, pious, and pro-Erdoganists
Most of them also do lack an adequate education (even Secondary), so their ignorance highly contributes to the existing stereotypes
If you are to visit rural areas in Turkey, you are also highly likely to witness the everlasting conflict between modernist/secularists and conservatives
However, there are also sweet old people who love to tell you their stories, how their great grandfather fought a war and etc, and complain about corrupt urbanization
Depends on the location
Sometimes they are cute sometimes not so much
Better ask the North Europeans, they all went there
Well there’s a poem called [why should we kill peasants] though
couldn’t find the english translation but yeah
I'd say Turkish, English, French and German are already quiiiiite enough
But eh
Won't stop me from learning Chinese
A lot of terrorist attacks happened and are still happening in Turkey
The most notable one for me was the 2015 Ankara bombing
109 people died and 500+ got injured that day
[Soma mine disaster] (2014) was a huge tragedy in our history
787 workers were trapped underground after the explosion, 301 of them died
It caused a major uproar because there were safety breaches
My sympathies for Lebanon
Such a sad year it’s been
i still cannot visit the place where bomb exploded
i hope we don't go through that downward spiral again
Maybe
Im really not sure
Nah that was 2016 and instead of explosions there where tanks and jets for that one
I remember my windows shaking while the jets flew above
The 2015 attacks where confirmed to be done by ISIS
Greece: Yall have an awesome history(and are really hospitable)
Armenia: Well, not a lot of Turks say it so, I'm sorry for what happened in 1915
I hope we can reconcile
Tasty food btw
the Netherlands: I love your architecture
Dutch towns look so pretty
‘the place where god has forgotten ‘(allah in unuttugu yer)
‘Bottom of the hell’ (cehennemin dibi)
"The place God forgot about":
Allahın unuttuğu yer
(Though I translated Allah as the god as it means in arabic, in Turkish it means more like "the Islam God" since there already is a word for gods in general: Tanrı)
“İnin cinin top oynadığı yer
” roughly translation is “where djinni(think as a devil) plays with a ball
” Yeah, I admit it
It is a weird saying
Also "the place where dog dies" (itin oldugu yer)
Should i give a list
we have yoghurt and turkish people believe turks found yoghurt . but in america yoghurt names is greek yoghurt
(fun fact Chobani founder is turkish )
but i believe nations cant have foods,regions can have food
we have same foods with greece and middle east
Turkey is a melting pot of culture
There are citizens from very different ethnicities
There are Turks -other than Turkey’s Turks, there are Azerbaijanis, Turkmen, Kirghiz, Uigur, Uzbek etc
Then there are Kurds with 20 million population
The other minorities include: Albanians, Armenians, Assyrians, Bosniaks, Bulgarians, Chechens, Circassians, Crimean Tatars, Greeks, Lazi, Arabs etc
Even when you’re the same ethnicity, the culture is different from region to region
After the Syrian war, we can include Syrian refugees and other Middle East migrants that followed
Turkey was already a very diverse country and it became even more in the past years
Yeah, we genocided greeks and serbians too why everybody upset with the armenian tho
Sarma - Serbia
Baklava - Greece
Rakı - Greece
Lavaş - Armenia
Pastırma - Armenia
Cacık - Greece
Yoğurt - Greece
Northern Cyprus - Cyprus/Greece
A few genocide issues with Armenia and Greece
Aegean and medditerrian sealines with Greece
And at least a hundred other things that i don't remind right now
Naaah fam they don't know reddit yet
When they learn about it i'll be fucking dead
I don't remember Jews one
We took them as refugees from iberia in 1450's. But yeah Assyrians, Kurds and the other tiny things
1804-1815 Serbians revolted for independence and the suprassion wasn't very friendly they made towers from serbian skulls
You know mate its the jedi way
Even the Kaiser Wilhelm and the Bismarck is ours xd
And you're absouletly right most of our people is retarded ultra-nationalists and their fantasy world is more imaginary than harry potter or lotr
I didn't know that but yeah we're also some kind of hitler ourselves
Of course you can't find because we sold "some" of the Ottoman Archives to the Bulgaria lol
Even my history teachers denied it and i was just smiling wondering how nationalism leaded us to rewriting the history
Yeah thats a 6D chess move
Hazır ol ya da olma, işte geliyorum
Hazır ve ya değil, işte geliyorum
"Hazır ol ya da olma, işte geldim
" is the translation from english to turkish
> I don't understand how so many Turkish citizens seem to give so much support to the current government
Neither do we
Even I can't see the reason behind that
Some people don't see Atatürk as the founder of the country bu as the "traitor" who ended the "great" Ottoman Empire
There is a lot of people thinking the Ottoman Empire was still as powerful as it was in the 15-16th centuries
Even though that was the case, which obviously is not, current situation in Turkey is not good and there are more rasons not to vouch for the current government
Economy is wretched, educational system changes almost every year, foreign affairs are not good, no freedom of speech and a lot of other things
However, the government says things like "We're very powerful", "Our economy is great
", "Other countries are jealous of us
" in public speeches and somehow, people believe
The reason is that when our current prime minister was first elected he was amazing but he definitely got corrupt over time
His supporters are diminishing and as for Ataturk he’s definitely one of the greatest leaders to ever exist no question
> Why does every single neighbor of ours is against us
Tell me about it
Most people are muslim on paper or just believe but doesn't practice
I’ll answer your question
While we are majority Muslim, we are a secular country with no actual restrictions on alcohol, and many Muslims, especially in the western areas are not very religious and don’t have a problem with drinking
That ties me to the other part, Erdogan
Like I said, a good portion of the country isn’t religious, and the other half
votes for Erdogan
This isn’t entirely true but it mainly is like that
A bit like religious people voting for Trump in the USA
Also, I wouldn’t be too afraid to go out as a woman
While our culture does have its flaws, we aren’t like the rest of the Middle East and you should be safe in most areas if you’re careful
Neither do I, pal
The beaches in mainland Istanbul aren’t really that good imo and if you want the best beaches, the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts are the best, but some of the few islands we have are a 30 minute ferry ride away from Istanbul and have great beaches
I wouldn't say amazing
He was definitely better though
Some people were still concerned because of his political thoughts which turned out to be really concerning a couple years after the election
No, of course not
Atatürk is loved and respected by the majority of the population from any kind of political thought
I should have added "Some" before "People
"Thank you for your comment, I will correct it
Wow, I thought you and Moldova were fine
And I thought Ukraine hates Russians instead of considering themselves as Russians
There are no common hatred or love towards Romania in Turkey
We are pretty neutral about Romania I guess
“Fanta” also referred as yellow cola
“Selpak” paper tissues
“Post-it” sticky notes
“Termos” flask
“Jakuzi” hot tub
“Uhu” glue
“Fön” blow drying, “Fön Makinesi” hair dryer
“Orkid” sometimes used for pad
“Tupper” the brand Tupperware bottles
“Jip/Cip” Jeep, 4x4 vehicles
In Turkey:
International brands:
Gilette: *"Jilet"* - Razor
Jeep: *"Jip"* - SUV
Chicklets: *"Jiklet"* or *"Ciklet"* - Chewing gum
(The letter *J* is not native to Turkish)
Bally: *"Bali"* - Rubber glue
Nationally:
Selpak - Tissue paper
Şaşal - Bottled water
Only orange
It’s orange flavoured, the colour is also orange but for some reason people call it yellow lol
A Slovenian friend of mine once admitted having washed his hands with the little tap inside the toilet
We use Anadolu (literally Anatolia) to refer to places that is not İstanbul, even European Turkey is included to Anadolu sometimes
We don't have word for places that is not capital tho (Ankara)
The old generation says "100 numara" (number 100) for toilets
The reason is, during Ottoman period, French was used a lot
I assume in France, toilets in hotels didn't have any numbers on their doors, therefore they were "sans numéro" (numberless/without number)
The pronunciation of sans (without) and 100 (cent) are the same so there was a little misunderstanding in this case lol
Also Turkish "Hindi" means İndian (The country one)
There is a rumor that turkeys were brought by traders coming from India through Turkey
I would say Kurdish
They are the largest minority with 18 million people
There are plenty of kurdish people in turkey
And you can see them talking only kurdish in mostly kurd areas
And i  suppose they talk kurdish in their homes as well
Kurdish or Arabic I don’t know there is millions of Syrian refugees
it's become arabic after some 7-8 million syrian refugees + their children
at least 10m people speak arabic in turkey
If my statistics are correct, about 9% of the Turkish population speaks Kurdish(native or not), easily making it the most spoken second language with about 7
5 million speakers even without English, considering very poor English proficiency in Turkey
Turkish, obviously
It's not the native language of at least 20 mil citizens
PS: Second language ≠ Foreign language
i have to disagree
people often mix kurds with zaza, alawi and other minorities living in eastern part of turkey
kurdish population of turkey is around 8 million and not every kurd can speak kurdish
Yeah i mis-read the question thanks
I taught an MS Office course at a university for about 3 years
I was also shocked by how low their computer literacy levels were
Apparently they're quite ok with user-friendly apps like Facebook or Instagram in addition to games, but they are not really able to solve problems
As a side note, they consistently tended to refuse to read error messages which were telling what to do and call me for help whenever something popped up
Hitting space 5 times for paragraph indents and 20 times for centering the title on MS Word
That's the summary of my experience
The youngest people as I observe learn thing in their own way
They are not challenged by important things like you mentioned
But my brother is 14 years old and learned needed Apple’s, Google’s and school’s ecosystem in 2 weeks with total of 12 hours computer lessons by school
My generation is not much literate in computer as younger generations are
I know how caps lock work, yet, I use shift because it is easy for me to type
Haha indeed, and it was the worst in the last 5 weeks or so when Access was the content
"Mine doesn't work
" everywhere
I can’t think of a weirdly spelled name in Turkish and there’s probably none
The way we pronounce things are exactly how we spell them
Though I would like to give some of classic foreign names’ transformation into Turkish
Jacob is Yakup, David is Davut and Michael is Mikail
I hope those spellings are weird enough for you guys x)
The name ''Kağan'' they mis-pronounce it by writing Kaan''
And, Joseph is Yusuf
Well after reading the comments of native speakers I feel good as if I achieved something big
Thank you guys
No, but planning on studying abroad and possibly moving there permanently
Biggest reasons are the education system, job problems, economic shitshow in my home country
Its called “demiryolu” which means “road of iron”
...what
Technically not “the iron road”
It's called "Demiryolu". Which, yes, means "Iron Road".
It really depends
A German or Dutch Turk wouldn't be controversial at all, while a Greek or Israeli would be very very controversial
Doesn’t your queen come from a German family originally
I mean ethnicity
Nope, newspapers fear the government here
No major ones, flair explains it I guess
Happens when Erdogan's buddies own 90% of news media
Yes
They are right to be so
Yeah, maybe
Still, they are cautious
Its not banned
You only asked a question Why people disliked lol :) no btw it is not banned
It isn't.
We don’t have that
Unfortunalety we don’t have friends,we have interests
Greece
Yup
We are fighting for like centuries but socially i always saw them as friends
I think Iran
The last major war was in 1639 and the border is pretty much the same since then
I believe the first time Turks fought alongside someone was with the Byzantines ironically but we know that didn't last so probably Arabs which started eith the Battle of Talas in 751 where Arabs and Turks fought aganist the Chinese
Thank you Tulip Brother/Sisterhood
How about Azerbaijan
Oh i forgot about Azerbaijan
They are our brothers, that is probably because they are Turks too, i am not that good with politics tho
"Queen Jadwiga"
That's King to you
I looked him up he is 196cm
I am 1
93 and I don’t like it when people are taller than me so probably not
They always say they are our brothers where in reality they brag about how their economy is better and how Turkey is a shit hole so i dont think they like us that much :d
Couldn't agree more
Can’t help it :D
Yes, because they sometimes are the only T-shirts around that are cheap
I gotta say my people don’t get sarcasm which leaves me dry so many times
Turkish people have more of a dark humour and self deprecating jokes
Lots of swearing too which I’m not a fan of
We also like to make fun of other people
I see people from Black Sea region does that a lot as I’ve experienced it my whole life
My relatives are hella mean
My old workplace was like this
Man it was hard
British humour is so good at sarcasm and dark humour, I lived there for a couple of years and people don't really get sarcasm here
Nor do they appreciate dark humour
So I find myself in an awkward situation quite often
(I hope I used nor correctly )
Ah cool
I'm really proud of myself lol
"silivri is cold
" (silivri soğuktur)
Silivri is a district in Istanbul, famous for its prison
basically prisoners of it mostly politicans and people that insulted erdoğan
when someone criticise the current govn't, this joke comes in
basically meaning "you'll need a coat, cuz silivri is cold
Best Greek singer
Armenian genocide
Pro-Erdogan people say Europeans are jealous of us (Turkey)
Rest of us are just having a laugh and use it as a sarcastic joke against them :-)
ahahhahwhah
It didn't happen/ they deserved it
Choose your line and continue
Literally yes
Yep i can not understand the politics about that goverment is trying to change the history lol
Yeah I follow some of countries politics like USA, UK, Germany and Greece
Eventually I hear about other European countries politic news
Not to be offensive or anything but out of all places, it being in Poland makes it 10 times scarier lol
Ohhh perfect
It starts in age 16, usually, for example, you father offers you for a sip
In 17, they can sell you alcohol in restaurants and 18 is the legal age
A local bistro owned by family friends
They already had very few customers before the pandemic and are now deep in debt
First name and last name with the middle name being the name of the father(if he is absent it can be the mother’s name)
You choose to keep your last name or change it when you marry and children take the last name(if parents have different they might have two or the parents can choose which one)
Father: Mahmet Kayaoglu
Mother: Zeynep Kayaoglu
Child: Veysel Mehmet Kayaoglu
I have seen cases where people have two first names and I’m pretty sure it’s legal but it’s usually happens when the mother and father can’t decide a name
The children mostly don’t have two names even in that case though they choose the one legally but use both names
Herding sheep, farming, making bread, cheese, wine
And probably dying at Russo-Turkish war several years later
i would be making kebab
"Its almost harvesting season
Depends which line of my family is considered
If it is my father's side; I would be a farmer in a small village of Kosovo called Gadima if I am not wrong
If it is my mother's side; I might have been something like a cleric or imam in western Turkey
Idk my mom's grandfather was a islamic music writer so I guess he was something like a pious man
Nice job if you ask me, probably pays decent
I guess I couldn't be atheist if I was leaving in early 19th century already
idk but it has to
yes, but not possible because our economy is pretty dependent on china
No, our economic ties to China are too large to risk
definitely, one of the things I hate most about our current government is how much they like to lick ccp's ass
Recognising and cooperating more with the republic of china is definitely something i'd support
sadly nothing
The Republic of Turkey does not recognise the Uyghur genocide
Also one of the places preferred by Uyghurs that manage to escape china is turkey due to cultural and linguistic similarities
But recently Erdogan's government decided to no longer allow Uyghur refugees to turkey and considering even resend those who came
Keep in mind that those are Erdogan's Islamist party and nationalist party-1 that "support" (by support I mean being ccp's dogs because they paid them), other parties like Kemalist party or nationalist party-2 condemn and try to inform people about this topic
He ~~lives~~ in Demre, Antalya, Turkey
P.S. But our man is dead
We just have his tomb
I can’t express the amount of times that americans (or brits) asked me if Turkey was a desert and if we really go around on camels and eat kebabs
Spoiler: we do not
While I was in Istanbul a middle aged woman asked me how could she pass to the "African side". I think she thought Istanbul is on both Europe and Africa or something
That we have deserts and camels
Spoiler alert: We do not
They’re also shocked to see our houses are modern, our skin is white and many women don’t cover up
I was working at a hotel
One of the customer asked me “I didn’t expect Turkey like that”. And I said “beg your pardon
What you meant
”. He replied that, he was expecting that we have deserts and camels, exotic houses, nearly all women covered up, men with longer beard
I guess he was upset what he saw
It doesn’t have something to do with the population but rather the geographical conditions of the country
But 83 million is a lot none the less
Even though most of it live in big cities, it’s hard to find untouched areas in Turkey
Some of our local accounting softwares were only working on Windows XP for too long up until recent years
And they were ugly af to use
This cloud system I don't know but it's a good thing so we should use it tho, our ex prime minster said
When I was a child, I closed down the bank customer service software (that shouldn't be able to be closed) in their computer by using task manager and played Pinball and minesweeper
half the country's identification numbers was leaked
Definetely "Kolay gelsin" phrase which basically means "I hope your job will be easier".
Anything involving TOKİ, which is an agency that constructs social housing
Just soulless apartment blocks
Answering the opposite would be easier to me
Most of the buildings in Turkey designed without sense of aesthetics
People find many architectural concerns unnecessary
The greedy constructors, costumers and also ideologies have too much power over architects
The main objective is designing an affordable buildings to make an huge profit
The result is mostly unfunctional, and boring looking
They try to make it more attractive by adding cheap plaster ormanents, golden color additions, unnecessary LEDs etc
**If they let you to design a regular building instead of a monster, it could be an architectural masterpiece in Turkey
** As a fresh graduated architect, I'm more satisfied to be unemployed instead of designing neo-classical shitty apartments
Yes
It's called "Religion and Morals
They primarily teach Islam and how to be a good person in general (morals and ethics)
Then Christianity, Judaism, Atheism etc
It's mandatory for all students but if your family doesn't want you to take the class, you don't have to
But most people take it anyway because It's an easy subject and it increases your average test results
I had an atheist Russian friend take religion classes just because it was too easy for her
We also have mandatory Philosophy lessons in High School
Does anyone else have them
Religion lessons exists and its curriculum and weight has increased in recent years
Religious lessons are indoctrination and a lot of detail stuff about Islam is taught
Part given to other religions is negligible
Science-denying and defamation of non-theism is prevalent
There is an opt-out for religious lessons
From this thread it seems like even first world countries suffer from propaganda in religious lessons
I'd rather say it used to be pretty much similar to the others described here, can't say it for today
Turkish schools do teach religion
It is quite annoying, as we also get tested on what we learn, and is part of our university exam
As long as society doesn't have anything against it(which they should have), the only logical answer is why not
Unfortunately yes and it’s only gotten worse
Stupid AKP even allowed girls to wear a headscarf in school which is awful because most of them are not done by choice but by being forced by religious nut parents
I’ve had many female friends who stopped wearing headscarves when they gained independence from their parents
“There is no force in religion” my ass
[Çorum] because apparently, it is the "[centre of the world]
Also, this quote also might affect my beliefs:
***“If the world was only one country, Çorum would be its capital”***
\-Napoleon Bonaparte
I want to say istanbul but it would be  strategically wrong
So konya i guess
Its was cultural hub back in the days and so it has great architecture
Chasing the European dream since,well that's not important
Refugee harbor country next door
I think it’s important to them that we don’t join but having good relations with EU is important
Our geopolitical position is the biggest reason for that
They would get 45 kilometers of coastline
Service isn't great, some patients are dicks but there are no major downsides in my opinion
Even in Turkey healthcare is better than USA
No Downsides
Some old women are using this privilege as social meetings
They re chatting, gossip, weaving and looking for a doctor future husband/wife for their adult children while waiting
Lol
>You have the highest survival rates in the world
Also less alcohol and tobacco consumption compared to Europe though
Surprised no one said Turkish
Having more than 1 third person pronoun (like English he/she/it) is still weird for me
So almost all European languages are weird
oi we heard you hate math
how bout we put more math in our language so you ll have to solve more math while doing math
Can you speak Turkish
Yes
I know nearly nothing about the 30 Years War, which is odd because my high school history textbook had an entire chapter about it
Ben de bunu yazacaktım, demek ki okul eğitimi yüzünden bilmemiz gerektiğini düşünüyoruz ama öğrenemiyoruz :)
Translate for Redditors: Came here to write this, seems like we think we should know about this but we can't learn it
we don't know about those things either lol
only mehmed conquered and won
All I know is that Sweden was involved(and its King died on the battlefield), and that
France was on the Protestant side despite being Catholic
I have no idea why my textbook had an enite chapter about it
The war practically barely touched the Ottoman Empire
Interesting
The only thing we learn about Poland is that the Ottomans fought numerous wars with them(and memorizing those treaties was a pain in the ass), and that WW2 started after Germany invaded Poland
The Turkish education system gives a lot of details and information, but it is VERY poor at explaining the wider international context
For example, while we learn that Poland fought against the Ottomans at Vienna, we don't learn *why* Poles fought there
Or why Hitler invaded Poland beyond "he was expansionist".
School typically starts at 9
00 but students are expected to be there some time before that
Lessons are 40 minutes and there are 5-10 minute breaks in between
If you have 8 lessons a day there is a 40-50 minute break after the 4th or 5th lesson
We builded worlds second submarine in 1719 and instead of using it for military purposes we used it for circumcision ceremony of III
Ahmed’s son
We became muslims thanks to the Chinese
Edit for Context:
There was that one time when a European king came to Istanbul, was given a salary(which he spent on bribing government officials) and refused to leave for 5 years until there was a shootout
He took our meatballs too
First:
Sultan abdulaziz who is the first sultan to ever visit a country abroad had a special compartment in his shoes and they put soil from istanbul in it
Because at that point, by law, any place the sultan steps on became his
Second:
During the Irish famine, for some unknown reason Ottoman sultan abdulmecid decides to help by sending 10000 pounds
British ambassador convinces him to send 1000 instead, because Queen Victoria had only donated 2000
He also sends 3-5 ships of food
Keep in mind that ottomans weren't doing that well themselves and we also have 0 relations with Ireland
They didn't even have an embassy here until 1998
Sultan Erdogan's son-in-law ran away with $128B of Reserve Bank money and people who asked about the money got arrested
Hezarfen Ahmet Çelebi (Scientist) designed wings for himself and flew for 3358 meters
From Galata Tower to Üsküdar
And he did this in 1632
Then Sultan sees him flying and decides that he is a dangerous man
Sultan forbids him to live in Istanbul
He dies in modern day Algeria
Hahahhahaha sounds like something that would happen at my job
Umm
Can I have one of those ?
We had the advantage but we ended our advantage in stupid way
In every military aspect there is an example of this
[In the battle of Talas] Karluk Turks were serving against the Chinese Army as mercanaries but China oppresed Turks at the time
However Turks had no other choice
During the Talas Battle, we changed sides and joined Abbasids because we didn’t want to be mercanaries of the China, the side who oppresed us
That battle and oppresion of Chinese caused Turks to have better relationship with Muslims and we became Muslims mainly thanks to that battle
If Abbasids never existed Eastern Roman Empire would probably be the main enemy of China and we would probably become Christians to escape the oppresion of the Chinese
That is very cool, thank you
I thought so too
It's a smart solution to a bs problem lol
An extremely disorganized ad agency
Today is the children's day in Turkey
Also 101 years ago today Grand National Assembly founded and Ottoman government overthrown
Today, the  national sovereignty and children's day
Today is the day our first national assembly was formed in 1920
such is life
If it wasnt for Covid we would normally be on the streets and joining ameteur parades
Its so fun every year
All people would bring flags and flag designed shirts and march to the city centre
This also happens on our other nationel holidays
-Loves from Turkey
Usually, children from all over the world would come in groups, visit the city, usually stay with a local family, hold parades and stay for a couple of days, etc
Its really colorful, quite fun and a unique experience for the visiting kids (probably anyways)
We don’t celebrate Christmas but what whole Europe does for Christmas, we make it for New year
So for us maybe 31st December
Absolutely
Even Greeks and Syrians, who I think look closest to Turks, can be spotted in a crowd by me
There is something distinctive beyond our hair color but I can't quite put it
Almost always
There was [this video] that I had watched
When I saw the girl, I immediately said she's Turkish
To no surprise, I was right
I guess it's because we have smaller eyes and more round face structure
I could only tell by their gestures and clothes
We have everything from blue eyes-blonde hair to dark brown complexions in Turkey
Lol sounds gangsta
I agree
I can’t put my finger on what it is exactly but it’s something to do with nose + hair + skin tone for us but it makes it so easy to spot another Turk
Though, Turkey is sooo genetically diverse that this should not be possible
Depends but i would say: Antalya, Bodrum, the historical areas of Istanbul and Cappadocia
Istanbul, south Aegean region and west Mediterranean region for resort tourism, Pamukkale and Capadocia for the geographical tourism
Istanbul, Kapadokya, Izmir, Pamukkale, and Antalya
There were a lot of tourists especially in Istanbul before covid and tourism is just a big money source for the country
Ananas aldırdım/i ordered to buy a pineapple
Anana saldırdım/ i attacked your mother
Just change the place of the "s"
Şeref siz misiniz
(Are You Şeref)Şerefsiz misiniz
(Do you lack Dignity
) (Şeref is a male name btw)
French
How do they decide whether to use "e" or  "é"?
In Latin based alphabet would be Portuguese, in the ones that I’ve tried to learn
It is like you think it is like similar pronunciation as Italian or Spanish but No they put random sh on “s” and x, ch sounds as “sh”. Pronunciation is the problem
But in every language it would be Japanese
Due to characters
Turkish is hard until it is not
i am sure this is how French pronunciation made up
same
The 'secret articles' in the Treaty of Lausanne will 'end' in 2023 and Turkey will become GLORIOUS overnight
Very Good
There are english texts in Turkish Wikipedia sometimes though
Turkish wikipedia doesn't include a lot of stuff mostly
You would quickly see the differences when you compare it with the english one
Turkish Wikipedia sucks ass
I use it only when absolutely necessary
turkish language wikipedia (vikipedi) is utter shite
few in number and unreliable "article"s.
i don't visit it
however it really grinds my gears when google just dumps vikipedi links on my searches (since my turkish ip address)
Same in Turkey
No it is not
Because we dont find it delicious and good
We would use it for tea
No it is not
Because we dont find it delicious and good
We would use it for tea
City: Too
Much
Traffic
A lot of Europeans I talk with seem to imagine Ankara as a green, liveable alternative to Istanbul however
Country: Domestic violence is overlooked a lot by the government
It isn't necessarily ignored in the rest of Europe but I've rarely seen Turkish domestic violence reported in EU  media
+ Economic and culturel gap between east and west Turkey
+Endless malign construction in Istanbul
Eeeeeeh
Most other Europeans I've talked with recognize that Eastern and Western Turkey are very different, they just don't know how huge the difference is
Honestly I wouldn't be opposed to letting Eastern regions secede, they lower our averages quite a lot
Yes but I don't think the problems will end
I was very young but I did not expect the atheists to be the majority in (western) Europe
Edit: I don't count people who don't have anything to do with christianity but call themselves Christian as "christian"
Turkey/Georgia
Don't try too hard
It's a mistake I make when I speak English
It's a mistake almost everyone I know makes
Throw some words together and native speakers will understand what you are trying to say
Also for Turkish, don't be scared by new letters
The sound of each letter already exist in your language
For example "Ç" is the sound you make when pronouncing "Ch". It already exists in your language, we just have another way of writing it down
Well speaking for Turkish don't strain yourself to completely correctly use the "çekim" ler (conjugations) as it is not just for the subject but also implies the time
This is pretty natural as our language is fairly a different language than whole European languages
Try to practice pronounciation with someone speaking the standarized Turkish by the way
Someone speaking Turkish in Edirne and someone speaking Turkish in Mardin sound very different, not delve that deep at the first turn
Other than just enjoy it
I think most of you would be interested in seeing most important part of the sentence can all expressed just by the verb
You are right
That sound confused me for a while
Also I meant in English
Sadly I don't know any French
I think thats more of a Mediterrinean thing, assuming you mean thousands of years by 'old as fuck'
Not to engage in a silly race nut there is literally a 2000 y.o. church at 200 meters to my home
And its nowhere near unique in Turkey
When you forget to close the door — “Were you born in village without doors
When you forgot something to say but you know what it is but can’t say it because you can’t thing of the word — “It is on top of my tongue” -not only mothers but universal”
When you pick you nose — “Are there excavation work going on
When you do something uncivilised — “Did you came from mountain
When your room got messy in short time like you did some project and asked your mum to clean it, when your mum sees it, she would say “Did bomb drop here
When you didn’t finish the plate, she would say “It will cry behind your back” which is makes you kind of sad when you are 5 hears old and you finish it just to not make food cry
When you do get instant karma, she would say “God doesn’t have a stick”
This is in our family, I am not sure if other families use it but if you open lights more than you need like living room, kitchen, corridor and bathroom lights are open or you make too much noise in long period, we would say “Are you signalling to astronauts
or Do you want to make sure if astronauts hear us
my mother always says:
I wish I gave birth to stones instead of you
Generally Grandma’s says this as “You left with one skin and one bone”, it means you are too skinny which is not for long after that proverb
I like how Grandma’s are bipolar when it comes to you, first they feed us until we are a wheel then complain why I gained weight
It only applies in York
Easily
I've never had a debate over how a Turkish word is pronounced
You can just put random letters together and everyone will read it the same
If you know the Turkish alphabet, you can pronounce every single word
Turkish
You'll figure out everything letter by letter 95% of the time
The 5% is when somebody uses a very old Ottoman Turkish, Persian, or Arabic-related
(we don't really have straight up Arabic words, and the ones we do aren't spelled or spoken the way it was intended to)
Yep, Turkish is 100% Phonetic
This is often true but not always
You would write "miğde" if you heard the word and never seen it written
Do you pronounce "yarın" as in tomorrow, the same as “yarın” as in indicative form of split
Same here
You write down what you hear and say what you write
Mostly yes
There are some different pronunciations from a minority of people, but most of the population will pronounce the same
They are different words
You could pronounce "yarın" as in tomorrow and everyone can write it down
You could pronounce it as in indicative form of split and everyone can write it down
But this contradicts with "throw some letters together everyone will read it the same". There might be some issues there
It's actually the same
Each letter has one pronunciation and one pronunciation only
So you can hear a word and write it down
Or you can write down a word and everyone will read it the same
If you know Turkish, so you know the difference
Obviously it would be hard for a not native language person
Le trône
(The throne)
I don’t know if this is common but my mum calls it “Taht”(Throne) as like “When will our king leave its throne
” to ask me how long will it take me to get out
Ayak yolu = Foot path (perhaps related to nature calls)
Yüz numara = Hundred number (a misnomer from French where the public toilets were numbered 00, "sans" número, heard as "cent numero", number 100)
We sometimes refer to it as “ayak yolu (foot way)” but I wouldn’t call it poetical
Never heard of it
“sıkıldım”
heheh
it can mean a completely different thing if it’s said wrongly
heh
Of course swear words like "amına koyayım",  "oruspu çocuğu" isn't it a perfect starting for learning a new language
heh
_do_ put dots over it
Kanka (It is the abbreviation for "blood brother" but used as dude or mate nowadays)
Aga (Lord/Master)
Reis (Captain)
Abi (Brother)
Beyler (Gentleman/Guys)
Oğlum (Son)
Thoose are what I recall now
**Kanka**: Shortening of *kankardeşi*, which means *bloodbrother*. We use it as "bro". Sometimes we type it as **knk**.
We mostly use
-Aga ( comes from ağa, which translates to landowner)
-Kanka = dude
-Oğlum = my son
It depends
"Kanka" is the most common, being a shortened version of "Kan kardeşi" or "blood brothers"(I think that is the literal translation
Other common words are abi(short for ağabey, older brother) or abla(older sister)
Kurds and Zaza probably have such words in their own languages as well which are probably used by Turks living in those regions
If we are calling a group (male based) we mostly use  "beyler" [Bey means some sorta sir and -ler (it might be -lar depends on the word) is plural suffix] ;if we are talking with just one friend, we call him "kanka" (some sorta bro but its different) and we also use "oğlum" [It means my son
Yeah its a little bit of weird but we short it as olm (yea i wrote it by how it pronounces) and it becomes a very different word -we mostly use this in argo]
Don't forget -je words like 'broertje' little brother
Thats also sweet
Or 'faka' for more street vibes haha
Bedankt dat je dat hebt uitgespookt
Damn that is interesting
We call Poland "Polonya" right now but Polish language is called Lehçe.
Edit: Ottomans called Poland "Lehistan" tho so you are right about that too
Rulers begin to bring everything that isn't in Istanbul to Istanbul from the newly conquered territories
This includes monkeys from North Africa
The new Sultan, Murad the 3rd, appoints a guy he likes to a high place in the government
Coincidentally that guy absolutely hates monkeys for some reason
He tells the crowds that "Women use monkeys to do bad stuff" and this gets the attention of a few monkey haters around him
In a friday, he and an angry crowd of like-minded monkey haters just say "fuck it" and he fucking hangs every monkey he can find around the city
There weren't any monkeys in Istanbul after that
Sup, Almanya
I don't say we don't have them but I have never seen the boy scouts or the girl scouts in my country
We have a lot of them, the ones in the big cities are well preserved
But the ruins that are forgotten or in small cities are usually destroyed by bounty diggers or villagers(they used stones to make houses)
It was also somewhat popular in Turkey, especially in the internet cafes
People would sit and play wc3 DotA and CS while listening to this stuff
Not so proud of it but still good memories
Why would you feel guilty for Live is Life
The fact that we won't be able to join the EU in the near future
Besides accents, the word he chooses in a patterned way of translated words from his native language makes one distinguished so i be sure
They use the most used definitions for some words without knowing its not the same thing as he meant
Yes, Portuguese are usually pronouncing “Cheap” as “Sheep”.  You end up wondering if they bought it cheap or with sheep
Majority of my whole floor was Turkish, I figured it out 2 weeks later when they spoke Turkish in the kitchen
Between these times, I spoke them in English
Reason it took me so long is that I was one of the first students to arrive and only one Portuguese that came exact same day who become a friend and start to hang out with them more
Not one letter but some dots:
Ölümlü: mortal
Olumlu: possitive
Sık-mak = to bore/ to squeeze
Sik-mek = to fuck
Sıkıldım = I'm bored
Sikildim = I got fucked
That i/ı, İ/I difference is mostly not given attention by foreigners, their pronunciations are also somewhat similar for someone who is not native and the results are quite funny when someone misuses them
Some lazy people like me writes i instead of ı in mobile keyboards and it sometimes creates unwanted situations
Poorly localised programs have this problem too
Note: It's a one letter difference in the root word but vowel harmony makes it multiple
In turkish, I'm bored means "sıkıldım". But if you are using english keyboard instead of turkish and type like that, outcome is being "sikildim" and it means I am f***ed"
It is
We call them "noktalı harfler" which means "dotted letters or letters with dots" so "Ü would be dotted U" so we see them as similar letters even tought they sound really different
We have both i and ı which sounds totally different
we use İ and i for I and i in English
I and ı is a lot different
Turkey is usually free
There are some private colleges but they also give you scholarships if you are succesful enough
If you are from a foreign country, I think there was a small fee but that is all
I think that Turkey might have the cheapest universities in European standarts
Human life, minimum wage, cost of basic living
Supermarkets have 1
5 L water for 0
13€ .
I like them, too until they act like Thor killing the neighbourhood
I like it, especially when electricity is gone
refrigerator - buzdolabı - ice cabinet
Ayçiçeği = Moon flower and the meaning of the word is sunflower
Yumurta sarısı (yolk) also translates to eggyellow in English
This didn't really work because Turkish suffixes replace full words in English
Merhaba, adım Can
Tanıştığımıza memnun oldum
Nerelisin
simple, using only word roots: Hello, name Can
Meeting pleased be
Location
with suffixes: Hello, name-my Can
Meeting-ours-that pleased be-am
Where-er-you
That last word asks which place you belong to, -er- as in Londoner
I was dreaded by the thought of doing this, thanks
Bears and wolves probably
They aren’t exactly near residential areas though
You have more chance of getting attacked by a stray dog than either of those animals
Either the Anatolian leopard or some kind of spider I forgot it's name but it's very deadly
With the humans in first place with a very large margin, third place is shared by ticks, boars, bears and wolves, all of which are challenged by [the kangal dog] as the fiercest non-human animal in Turkey
You have polar bears
I don’t know if I’m excited or terrified by the thought of that
I’m sorry but that’s so metal
Not in the EU day, but when I was solo visiting Frankfurt there was an EU event
I was passing by and they handed me a paper flag
I was happy to fly it all the way through my visit
we are
Similar situation here
It has been so overused by the right wing, flying it for no special reason is a bit weird now
we can switch our position in the continent, if you want :D
[Hababam Sınıfı] \-  Lazy, uneducated students share a very close bond
They live together in the dormitory, where they plan their latest pranks
When a new headmaster arrives, the students naturally try to overthrow him
A comic war of nitwits follows
This film created from book which published in 1957
4 IMDb rating
Everyone knows this film
It is still aired every week in some channels
This one is not universal unfortunately
It is like made for Turkish audience only
Some jokes might not make sense but it is still enjoyable film
\-edit- .[G.O.R.A.] you can try this one, it is from 2004
[The best films of all time from NTV News] for who wants to explore more
We don't have a lot of good movies so I suggest you just watch "Veda"
I am not Italian but I watched “io e te” the topic of the film was not so attractive but the scenes
They were absolutely incredible
Kibar Feyzo from Turkey
These are great movies
I'm still waiting for more from the same team
Thank you for the list
Are these all sad dramas
Can you also recommend something more fun to watch
I was scrolling with the same two movies in mind
Hababam Sınıfı series is excellent, as well as other films by the same group of actors such as [Neşeli Günler] and [Tosun Paşa]
I'd be happily surprised though if any of these films attract any non-Turkish audience
They form a part of the mythology of my generation and I love them
Although not a movie, the Emmy award winning miniseries [Şahsiyet] is totally awesome
You heard this person, Now(!), where didn’t we raid
I would like Boris Johnson to use his rightful claim to the throne of Turkey
Merkel for sure, but does not matter, most of the others would be pretty good too
Can I have Merkel
Our head of state could use cooling off a little bit
Replace Erdoboi with Merkel
She seems super cool
Also, experience in crashing the Greek economy is a huge plus here
I wish you could send her over to us when you're done, like a retiring football player
Big fan of her
The fact that we have no gender system
It makes everything way easier in my opinion
We have letter that has no sound "ğ" it's called soft g, it doesn't make any sound
I like how you can change the sentence order based on your emphasis
Example:
Ben bunu buraya getirdim
I *BROUGHT* this here
(It’s a regular sentence)
Ben buraya bunu getirdim
I brought *THIS* here
Bunu buraya ben getirdim
*I* brought this here
What you emphasise in the sentence changes based on the order
It’s quite useful in conversation
We aren’t sexist like y’all
Makes it easier to communicate with everyone too you aren’t sure which pronoun to use wait you can’t do that they are same for everyone
Oh yeah
Turkish also doesn't have he/she/it
Just use "O" for all of them
[Kinda] ğ makes no sound but it adds lenght to the letter before it
You can listen to google translates translation it pronounces his surname correctly
We guys have so much in common
I keep hearing about that our language have the same words and grammar structures with Finno-Ugric languages
I don't think it's a necessity
We usually say the name of the person who we are talking about
[Kokoreç] (grilled intestines), [işkembe] (tripe) soup, [brain salad] and probably other meals involving offal
[Şırdan] must be up there too due to its interesting shape
Also, one time I let an American friend try ayran and he almost vomited, so maybe that
Brain salad
You boil some brains in vinegar and salt until it's soft and then drain them and cut them and put some olive oil, lemon and vinegar on top and bam you got yourself some (probably healthy) brain salad
Or maybe "Mumbar". I've never personally eaten it or even came across someone who've eaten it but I think that it's popular in the southeast regions
It's made by filling sheep's intestines
Google it
I know it sounds interesting
omg covid 20 might break out from this thread
in turkey some people drinks a soup which sheep's head and foot in it
Şırdan is [abomasum] stuffed with typical dolma stuffing: a mix of rice, ground meat, tomato/pepper paste, and some spices such as cumin and pepper
i know we have pretty similar cuisine but  i was not aware of kokorec is also known in greece until now
it surprised me similarity reaches even to kokorec lol
worked in denmark for a longish period
these are my opinions (i.e. my views; let's not forget opinions are personal :) so please don't flog me)
* the climate is not as bad as the other nordics
i think, it is the best
you still have your windchill and rain but that's about it
but there is general lack of sunlight because it's always damn cloudy
the weather will get to you but not as bad as you think
a minor drawback
* cars are for some reason really expensive
a lot of people drive junkers and honestly i have no idea how they pass the inspection
public transport might be great in the capital area but if you are in somewhere like sønderjylland the public transport sucks
this means you can't buy your groceries in bulk, get ready to cycle a lot in the rain, wait a lot for connection bus/train etc
* anything that is a service is expensive
like getting a haircut, getting a taxi, going to a car mechanic, calling a plumber, delivery etc
conversely, most goods are not that expensive
alcohol, meat, various groceries, electronics etc
* it is a really individualistic society and to be honest people are not really social
this is coming from me, a guy considered almost asocial in turkey
a lot of danes take antidepressants
at least the majority of ones i knew
loneliness is an issue here
* they are not really accepting of foreigners
so don't be surprised if you end up hanging out with a mix of people from venezuela, germany, poland, lebanon, peru etc
sure you will hang out with the locals though almost exclusive to binge drinking
* the language
this might be exclusive to denmark as it is really hard to speak
i could read and write but speaking
it's on a whole another level
since virtually everyone speaks english it is tough to be a beginner in danish
at least it was for me
- keee jeggg fooou eyn pakkk gröooghghghd marlboro
(tries to say *kan jeg få en pakke rød marlboro
- hvad siger du
- a red marlboro please
- nåååååååh!
* you pay a lot of income tax (near 50%)
still, as net salary you are higher than a lot of EU countries
though when you rank up to more senior positions this becomes not the case anymore
> No one wants to ask "too many" questions in fear of being seen as nosy, and if you ask someone questions about themselves, they may feel uncomfortable about talking "too much" about themselves and will only reply with the exact information you asked for, no elaborations or follow-up questions
I think I'm Swede
Wow, thank God I’m not that anxious
If we worked together I’d definitely offer you tea/Turkish coffee and talk about daily things, hobbies, even little personal life details after some time
My problem is people try to talk about personal stuff immediately after meeting
You can get “interrogated” while waiting in line with other people if you try to chit-chat
So, guess we have to find a medium ground
> Kone
pretty damn good elevators though :D
We use quite a lot in messaging but not as much when we are talking but still used in talking
It's used when texting
It was rare and it used to be sound cringe
It's used more in last decade, still not very common
Depends on where
Western parts and coasts (except eastern black sea) we use it alot
> We use quite a lot in messaging
Yes, probably
"Basically the same thing all over again but we're against ourselves this time"
We won against invaders, and we are a great republic now
And another world war happened, and unlike the first, we choose being neutral
We did an operation to cyprus and we are doing many operations on syria now
Well, that was the entire story of Turkey
Or the Sørenga Marina thing
We have a county named "Of" in the Black Sea Region
It's famous for It's delicious tea and lush green mountains
It's located in Trabzon province so you can say "Of of Trabzon" lol
Of, a town in Trabzon, people from Of never say they are from Trabzon tho, they insist that Of is and should be a city
Weird people those are
Happy cake day
Happy cake day
Popeye translated as “Temel Reis”. When it is translated, it will help to intergrade to your culture
In some cartoons, The Hulk is translated as "Yeşil Dev". And it literally translates to "Green Giant".
Lol
Sounds straight out of a sitcom
I can imagine myself taking offense if my neighbor sent me a letter
Well, everybodys a little weird I guess
I remember being surprised that some people sounded much friendlier than others, couldn't tell if it was an accent
Definitely It is Ankara
Nobody likes Ankara except people from Ankara
It is called Gray City
I think it is a soulless city
The only beautiful thing about it is the Mausoleum
Turkey's capital is Ankara, it's not as hated as İstanbul I guess so it's spared
The only thing I've heard about Ankara is that it doesn't have a seashore and is too gray, however this argument is not-so-surprisingly defended by people living in İstanbul or İzmir, which is another big city and either loved or hated for WHOLE different reasons, so yeah
Woaw That is great to have friends like that
But WHAT DID YOU SAID ABOUT ISTANBUL
It is the worst SIN you can commit
Go to guillotine
The sea joke put  smile on my face
It is really rife joke amoung us
Actually It is pretty controversial
One side says it is amazing city to travel not to live
On the other hand some people love it and live there  in spite of all issues or they are dreaming to live there
And lately Istanbulites who are mostly well educated have been leaving the city due to chaos, refugees, security issues, overcrowdness, pollution
They have been going to the south seaside cities such as Izmir, Antalya, Mugla
They are seeking green, happy life which we don't have here unless we are rich
Living at (?) the Anatolian side, have been regularly coming to the European side for half a month and I'm already sick and tired of it
I've been coming to Beşiktaş for so little time yet its chaotic environment makes me want to lay down and cry
Kadıköy, however, or generally the "karşı yaka" as istanbul elitists would call it, is one of the best places one can live in Turkey
I would choose to live in Ankara rather than trying to find my way through Şişli one more time without hesitation
Enjoy the chaos
Istanbul sometimes bother me, choke me although I love the city, vibrant
Then I just fly to Antalya and enjoy the silence and heaven as well :)
I love Kadıkoy and also love Besiktas as well
It is killing me softly but what can i do :)  When I leave the city for summer break i miss it by  1 month
Sisli has great neighborhoods like Bomonti
Visit the old beer factory
I don’t know about Turkey
However, if there is a scandal, I don’t think our sheep population would force the government to collapse
They will be remain silent
And keep support the government
Not at all
We suck at foreign language education
Most people straight up have no knowledge at all
Then, a lot of people who claim to speak English suddenly freeze when it comes to speaking for real
They go "oh I can understand but I can't speak"
Hell, even university professors are like that
Must have that maybe some people have
(and speaking like a native english person is wayy more rare)
Georgia: Cuisine, especially wine
Greece: Music
I can't answer this question because of legal concerns
The president, duh
And I can easily say this for most of Turkey's population
Contain your assumptions
When I went to name my child they told me 'you can name him anything without the letters x, w, q because they don't exist in official Turkish'. I asked again, 'anything
', she said 'anything' with an emphasis
So I guess I could have named him Ferrari Jean-Claude Van Damme
Yes, there are even people named “Roket Atar/Rocket Launcher” and “Bok/Shit”
The smell of cooking kebab or doner
I might also answer "tulip smell" but for that Netherlands is more fitting I guess
I would choose one of black tea, salça, kolonya, or cigarettes
Especially kolonya
To be honest every street in Amsterdam smells weed
Hah, that is really wholesome
But on a serious note, I think it is there is nothing wrong with Netherlands-tulip thing, Turkey might be where it is originated but the country that has absolutely stunning tulip fields and farms is also the Netherlands, in Turkey a few small tulip mosaics is the max you can find
I guess just saying it is common culture for both of our countries is the best option lol
Well, to answer your question i first need to clarify a few things about kebab
Firstly, kebab is not one specific food and rather a wide term used for many dishes
(Example, [both] of [those] images are considered kebab, but they do not look alike each other right
) Etymologically kebab comes from Akkadian or Aramaic language (word origin is disputed) and means something like "meat that been cooked on fire". Of course, its modern usage is different but this should give you an idea of how wide the term is
There are a lot of Kebab types, some of them are Arabic origin some of them are Turkish origin etc, almost every western Asian country has its own traditional kebab
There is even one with greek origin but as the founder of it, Alexander Efendi lived during ottomans times way after Greek independence it never become popular in Greece
[Alexander Kebab]
The most known one (and the one that usually comes to peoples mind when said kebab) is [Adana Kebab] And the second most popular is [the Doner kebab
] According to my research, the most popular kebabs in Germany are those two, who had been around ever since medieval times
They just had been brought to Germany by Turkish diaspora, so it seems wrong to say those are german cuisine just because they are popular in Germany
But as I stated above, if a german chef (or a non-german chef in Germany who identifies as german) founded a new type of kebab there wouldn't be anything wrong with calling it german
But Adana and doner kebabs are definitely not like that
hope this helps fam
I am not sure for my country really
In olden times we loved opium so much that we named a province after it and still use the name
So, idk what will happen if we legalize cannabis
If tobacco is legal, then cannabis definitely should be
Greenland is same as size as, or bigger, than Australia so why Greenland is not a continent
and this was my argue with teacher until she found an encyclopaedia to show me their area in numbers
I kept mixing İsveç(Sweden) with İsviçre(Switzerland) until I learnt where they were on Atlas
You were living in the right timeline
*ROMA INVICTA*
İstanbul for history, religions skyscrapers and modernism
Athens for beauty and history
İzmir for history and foods
Madrid for esspecialy religions
Berlin for understanding what is eu like
London for its atmosphere and economy
Paris for seeing the beauty
Moscow for seeing the modenism and skyscrapers
Vienna for seeing what we couldnt take
[Madenci] It local coffee  brand which I haven’t drank any better one yet
Ayup, my current boyfriend is American
The cultural differences are too awkward sometimes
In turkish  the verb azmak means to come or to get horny while in Azeri and Eastern dialects of Turkey it means to get lost
I tried to spell it, it is pretty hard
For Turkey, the answer is no
But we have 2 types, youth and olds
Old complains time to time how they did things different than when they were in our age
But mostly they know that time has changed, the world has changed since then so they give us advice how to be a better person
At least this is how I encounter these types
By the way, It is rely on respect to each other
Only "O" it means he-she-it
o - means she/he
"O" means he/she/it, basically third person singular pronoun
O : means he ,she ,it   ( we say one word to man,woman and animals)
There's two that come to my mind right off the bat
O = He/She/It
E = Well would be the closest translation, but it's informal
"E yani" would translate to English imperfectly as "well more or less
" If you want to be even more informal a dragged out "e" sound would signify a "go on" that is likely said with impatience or suspicion
Also "e" is commonly used in spoken Turkish as "so
" and a specific way to say "so much".
In addition, Turkish has this letter ğ (soft g) which basically makes the previous vowel longer
So "ağ" is really "aa" and so on
And there we have a few more single vowel words
In Turkey that's a definite yes, along with talking about your possessions (the high-end ones like houses, shops, investments etc)
Asking about someone's earnings is even worse
Regardless, many people tend to do it but then their manners are questioned
Only talk about it if you want to talk about the job market, usually if you are in the same profession
It helps knowing how much you should negociate for when discussing salaries with your employer
Personally I haven't discussed my salary since I started making much more than the average wage and my friends who also make much more than the average dont either
I think black is more popular but green is popular as well
Probably like 60% black 40% green
Both are very popular but I've seen black more than green
Hmm
I can’t decide
Gemlik and Ayvalik are the two regions in Turkey that produce the most olives; and they are both known for their green olives
Well that could be true I'm not exactly an olive expert
It is just most of the people I know consume black olives that is why
But I personally prefer green olives
Not anymore
I used to walk when I was in Primary(2002-2008) literally anywhere
I was living in city over 2 million
My brother in other hand didn’t since we don’t trust the outside anymore
Either he was dropped by my father, walked with my mother or school bus
Depends on the province but in Istanbul not even adults just walk to places such as schools
The city is so large that you have to use some sort of a vehicle to get to places
For example, I am considered to live sort of close to my school but even with that it takes me 30 mins by bus to go to my school
My friends that live in the Asian side (our school is on the European side) have to wake up at like 5
00 am because it takes them 2 hours to go to school
So for small kids a lot of parents prefer private school buses (they are basically buses that specifically pick you from your house and leave you at school and vice versa
yes they are expensive but parents are willing to pay for that) and when they get older they usually start using public transport like subway, tram, buses and even ferries
This is what it looks like
To fix it I think you should add a colon to the end of the flags, like " :flag-de: living in :flag-dk: ".
[Yes, it's fixed] :) np
Turkey should not be considered in this subject
Turkish Republic is not secular in *at least* in this matter
I actually understand older Gokturk Turkish better than Ottoman Turkish
Ottoman has a lot of Persian and Arabic drived words so it is a bit hard
Folk poems and legends from 1600s are somewhat understandable, but a legal document from 1918 may be completely incomprehensible
Ottomas had (what I call it) a dual language system, one for is nobility and state business and one for regular people
Those two languages are both Turkish but the lexicology of the noble one is heavily affected from Persian and Arabic
Things were like that until the language reform in the Republic era in 1930s.
For more information:
**The articles** does not exist in Turkish Language
So, we use them incorrectly
Sometimes we forget to use, sometimes we overuse them
**a/an** is more understandable, but **the** and **the difference between the and a/an** are mystery lol
For the beginners, **a/an** is translated as *bir*(**one**)
(*bir elma* = **one apple, an apple**)
We can't translate **the**: "It doesn't have a meaning" is said to beginners
We use "açmak"(open) both for the act of opening a door or lid, and turning on an electronic device in Turkish
So it's rather common to see Turkish speakers use expressions like "open the lights" or "open the radio".
Another thing I see used is "pulling a photo" - as Turkish uses "çekmek"(pull) for taking photos
Instead of making rookie grammar mistakes, they will TALK TO YOU IN LOUDER TURKISH
We pronounce the word "archive" wrong
We took the word from French, so we try to pronounce it like French in English sentences
Funny thing is I realised that a month ago :)
Haha these encounters are always funny
Me and my couple friends were wandering around Porto streets and they were taking pictures of themselves quite long at famous rabbit pop art while I just wait at the corner
Relative 2 old couple approached and told each other “look at them, why they’re taking pictures etc
” LOUDLY IN SLANG TURKISH
I laughed very hard in front of their faces
You should have seen their red handed faces
It was hilarious
P.s: these couples were only Turkish tourists I encountered at our 3 days Porto visit
I imagine It was vice versa for them
It's compulsory for all Turkish citizens from birth
It's only accepted in Turkey, Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia and Northern Cyprus
Well, as I know it was always the same city
**1600s:** Kostantiniyye
**1700s:** Kostantiniyye
**1800s:** Kostantiniyye
**1900s:** Kostantiniyye-İstanbul
**Today:** İstanbul
1600: Konstantiniyye
1700: Konstantiniyye
1800: Konstantiniyye
1900: Konstantiniyye

Not much variation
To get a different answer you must go before 1453 and the biggest city in that time was probably Edirne as it was the capital but I'm not sure
I can comfortably say Istanbul, Istanbul, Istanbul, Istanbul and Istanbul
Non-native speakers of English,when did you start learning English and how did you improve your reading and speaking
I first began to learn English at school at 11 years old but until 20,I can't speak,read books and can't watch series and movies
Nowadays I am watching The Big Bang Theory with English subtitles and reading Harry Potter in English for improve my English skills
My reading is still slow but I'm sure that it will be better
So,Non-native speakers of English How did you learn to speak English well
I think I was about 10 years old, that was the time I started getting English lessons at school
Those lessons helped me to learn the basics of English
I improved my English mostly by listening to English songs, watching movies/tv series with English subtitles, playing video games in English
I've met a guy who will come for Erasmus to Kayseri, Turkey
Let me define you the Kayseri
It's geographically in the middle of Turkey
Full of conservative people, economically so bad and it has one of the worst university in Turkey
I'm very surprised and try to convince him to not to come
Then Corona came
Idk what happened next
Two of my class friends went to Greece
I studied in a unknown small city in Italy
It was a great experience
European small cities can provide a good student life
It's easier to discover and ecperience a small city in a limited time
They are more affordable compare to larger cities (maybe Norway is an exceptation)
You don't waste your time in traffic, sometimes you can just walk
When activities are limited, erasmus students find their own way
It strenghten the bonds between them
Someone who likes rain, I guess
Yep, we have Türk Dil Kurumu (Turkish Language Society)
TDK aka Turkish Language Institution
It was founded by Atatürk in early 20th century to protect and improve the Turkish language
Atatürk also changed the alphabet letters from Arabian to Latin which is more fitting for Turkish language, but not as fitting as Cyril according to my Turkish language professor in college
Yes, we have Türk Dil Kurumu (Turkish Language Association)
It is the official regulatory body of the Turkish language
It was founded in 1932 by Atatürk
The institution acts as the official authority on the language (without any enforcement power), contributes to linguistic research on Turkish and other Turkic languages, and is charged with publishing the official dictionary of the language
It is not possible to make an objective list like this but here are three songs I personally love and would like to promote as good Turkish music
First one is from 1974, by the band **3 Hürel**, an all time star rock band composed of three brothers
Their hit song [Sevenler Ağlarmış] is unsurpassed in many ways
When you listen wait until 3'14''.
**Mercan Dede** is one of the big stars of Turkish electronic music
He incorporates sufi music into electronic music pretty well
[Sufi Dreams]
**Fazıl Say** is one of the most internationally famous Turkish musicians, a prodigy of classical music
He is one of the best pianists alive and also a great composer, utilising Turkish themes in his music
[Black Earth]
Bonus: **Peyk** is not such a well known modern rock band but this [Don Kafa Don] is my favorite and I also love the video
It’s not “fully” from my country, it’s a Dutch - Turkish band but the lyrics are full Turkish
Altın Gün - Süpürgesi Yoncadan
Pentagram is one of my favourite heavy metal bands
They are cool, also Anatolian rock is one of the best music genres, ever
You can check Erkin Koray, Cem Karaca and Barış Manço.
We have a march culture in Turkey since the foundation of Mehteran band in the Ottoman Empire many great songs were composed by Turks or Non Turks my favorites are from the 19th and 20th century of the Empire
After reforms of Mahmud II Empire started to westernize her music culture and a lot of songs and marches were composed I will do a list of those songs instead of giving one example:[Gondol Şarkısı ] [Mecidiye Marşı ] <—this march was composed by an Italian
[Mahmudiye Marşı] [İzmir Marşı] and finaly [Meclis-i Mebusan Marşı] there are more songs from early Ottoman era as well but I dont want to make this longer
[My own music] of course
:)))
"Aslan" means "lion" in Turkish
Is that coincidental
I’m really into Slavic folk music just because of them
>wait til 3'14''
What a terrible way to represent Turkey with a long gone empire
For the non-Turkish here, some of these marches are the anthems of the current oppressive islamist regime in Turkey, which like to show the ottoman culture as if it's the ancestral culture of Turkey, paving the way to a monarchic regime in the future
Yes, these people still exist
What
I have never heard even 1 time AKP using Mecidiye march or gondol song or Mahmudiye march what are you trying to say these are songs with no lyrics in them if you want to write an alternative to my songs then do another comment none of these songs are about Islam 2 of them are not even composed by a Muslim
None of these marches are used by AKP I would advise you to read my comment again
I never even said I want the Empire back I dont understand what you are doing
I said "some of these songs" are anthems to the current regime
I didn't say they are islamist
They are imperialistic, as in nostalgic of the times of a long gone empire
But of course you are entitled to like them and show them around
I was just shocked that the only entry from Turkey was not from Turkey :-)
Im not a far right supporter or anything but Turkey is the continuation of the Empire we paid the Ottoman debts and most of the people who formed the republic was from Ottoman traditions and education
None of these song are used by Akp Btw
Okay, we can have different opinions on that
I don't see Turkey as continuation of Ottoman Empire, rather a country that gained independence from it like all the others (you could say the Bulgarians or the Arabs also got Ottoman education and background
) But yes, the last Ottoman capital is in today's Turkey
And I admit I don't know the individual songs; I just say that the current regime loves Ottoman marches instead of Turkish marches and uses it for the said cause
Its okay to have different wiews of course but songs are good and most of them are composed by Turks thats why I said those songs so it fine no problem man
And those songs does not celebrate superiority of a Turkish person over others they are just songs but I of course respect your wiews
Granted, I'm not a Cypriot, but as a Turk this is relevant to my country's foreign policy a lot
Honestly, they should re-unite in my opinion, but that seems to be a pipe dream in the near future
You should ask this on r/Cyprus
This discussion is a mere past-time there
Not a Cypriot but I personally think Cyprus should reunite, but also be an independent state
Not Turkish, not Greek, not British
A separate entity on its own
I am not Cryptiot but I heard from a Northern Cyrptiot guy that the Turkish Cypriots are between meh and sure in reunification while Greek Cypriots are between naaah and meh
First of all, I'm not a Cypriot but I'm Turkish therefore I think I'm related to this topic
Reunification won't solve anything, as it was the thing that caused the problem in the first place
It's been going fine for almost 50 years, Recognizing Northern Cyprus as a State of it's own is  probably the best solution both sides can agree with
Of course a unification would be great but it won't happen due to 2 things first one being "politics" and the second one being the fact that we don't live on a planet where there's no such thing as discrimination
Also from what I've heard neither the greek nor the Turkish part likes non- Cypriots in their country, don't know how true it is though
Correct me I am wrong but when did Turkey not want unification
Far as I know, Turkey was Pro-Unification
All bow before the prophet
its not considered an occupation in Turkey
Yup, we generally do so
I think that the Northern part should make their own decisions and Turkey should stay in the background unless TRNC needs support
But, idk if the unification happens
Turkey and TRNC are too connected
Turkey is the biggest economic partner of TRNC
TRNC is also a place of different laws
They have gambling, a big tourism industry, etc
I don't know what would happen if they join the EU, Turkish people may not be able to visit them that often and that would diminish the economy a little
TRNC is also a somewhat safe heaven for young immigrants
It is a weird way to join the EU
There are people from all around the world to study there, live some time there, then go immigrate to mainland Europe
It is also a good place for Europeans to get cheap surgeries
Last and not least, I know people in Turkey who have summer houses in Cyprus
Idk, what would happen then
We don't even use passports to go to the island, we just use ID's. Many people would have to aquire passports and even visas
Thats all
I am open to questions
Turkey wants to troops to stay there until agreement signed
Greek side wants to gone before agreement is done
As summary, I guess Turkey wants them to stay until an agreement done is for leverage
If agreement not succeed again, World will see Turkey sending troops as aggression so with current international stage would make Turkey loose all EEZ right that it claimed
Turkey doesn’t recognise or signed EEZ because of Island Dispute with Greece in early years of republic
So there will be international court to solve this problem
Turkish and Greek Cypriots should do the unification agreement with approval of Greece and Turkey
Then I am sure if we all are grown enough to sign this agreement, we are grown enough to make unifying to happen
They do have a very distinctive accent yes, but then so do a lot of regions in Turkey proper, so ultimately it doesn’t make them any less Turkish
You know that TRNC founded in 1983 and is independent state in eye of Turkey, right
There will be referendum(like used to) in TRNC about unification which Turkey can’t do anything about it
Since Greece and Turkey protector of each state, I meant approval as just to sign, agree it whatever it comes out
Far as I know, Turkey has accepted what deal come from with protection and survivability of Turkish Part
I don’t know about why Turkey is main negotiator but I can guess as Greek side sees this as invasion and any other country other than Turkey doesn’t recognise this state
So this might be why
Turkey doesn’t have any political control over Cyprus as well
For us, they are independent state
This makes if deal is not what Turkish Cypriots like, this probably will be seen in referendum
Just approve what Cypriots agreed on and make it official
Turkish is protector state of Northern Cyprus which Turkish Army has presence of 35,000 and far as I know Greece is for Southern Cyprus
So approval makes it for both side to accepted reunion
Turkey doesn’t recognise or signed EEZ so what Turkey do looks acceptable for them
If you want to solve this issue, there should be court about Grey Island in Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece to start solving
Naval Supremacy can be gained with NATO and friendly relationship with Cyprus
It is critical for Turkey because nobody wants to enter Arab Country’s Shit Hole to be honest in Turkey
Erdogan’s dreams make him loose voters
They do have different parliament, army, president, government and laws
I do need visa to enter(which ID is enough) and residency permit to study or stay
It is and actual independent country for me and you whether your country recognise it or not
I think referendum shows what actual people of TRNC wants
Depends on how you look at TRNC
For me, it is not a puppet state
It is heavily depended on Turkey due to not being recognised but I don’t think a puppet state can start to drop Turkish Lira and start for making the country acceptable to EU for possible reunion
[President of TRNC,] say “It is considered as red line for North Cyprus to accept fully withdrawal of Turkish Army from Northern Cyprus ask by Greek and Greek Cypriot Side
Aren’t both of them same
Referendum is for future of both
It doesn’t exist, if you don’t recognise it
Nice motto
By the way, do you want me to take you TRNC
You can name whatever you want
At the end, you will have to recognise Northern Side to sign the reunion deal
Some see Turkey as heaven, others as shit show
Turkey is there to protect an independent state from Turkey for its interests
At this point, I think Erdogan doesn’t gives a shit about eye’s of the world, anymore
Whole world to Cyprus: “OMG, 2/5 of country has gone, I wonder what happened
Since I don’t recognise it, it means nothing happened
You are whole again
” It doesn’t matter if you recognise it or not
If it exists, it exists
Mmm maybe [because of this
] I like how you just forget the best part before Turkey sent the army where Greece did coup in Cyprus to make Cyprus join to Greece and before Greeks already removed [rights] which was given to Turks by protecting minorities
[Maybe help if you start reading from 1950’s to get why
Imagine voting against unification which 65% of Turkish Cypriots said “Yes” in 2004 and telling my why unification seems impossible
Yes, Turkey has right to protect its people, same for Greece
Maybe you understand me wrong
I don’t affirm anything other than protection of Turks and TRNC decision of reunion
+: (speaks with a perfect Istanbul accent)
-: "your accent is weird, where exactly are you from
"(with a perfect Istanbul accent)
+: "Wisconsin
"(with a perfect Istanbul accent)
I see this dialogue at least twice in different shows/movies
I don't know, but really wonder what's weird about Wisconsin accent
Unfortunately when I saw Fargo, my English was not good enough to distinguish accents
It was long time ago
But, I can check it now
Thank you for the suggestion:)
Each city has its own dialect, Each district in each city has its own dialect
But differences between district dialect is not seen much as between cities
In city centre, most of the people uses Istanbul Dialect so this is why it is hard to see now
We don't really have different dialects in Turkey
Some regions may use different words for stuff but that's all
But we have different accents
In urban areas like Istanbul
most people speak Istanbul Turkish (the official one)
But in rural areas like the black sea region(especially the northeastern part), southeastern Turkey etc
people there, especially the old ones, will have a different accent
Every region has its own dialect
For example a person from the Aegean region will hardly understand someone from eastern region
But everyone can understand Istanbul Turkish which is the main dialect of Turkish
Not a single nation/ethnicity name but whenever someone gets racist towards Turks over the things Ottoman sultans did I find it a bit amusing — they were barely “ethnic Turk
” considering how many had non-Turkish mothers then they made a kid with another non-Turkish mother and he became the next sultan
Same reason racism is kinda sorta hating yourself in this region and abouts
Any examples of any Turks claiming Homer was Turkic
English, Turkish or even Greek language sources will do
I agree
I’m referring to the racist comments based on ethnicity, over the Ottoman sultans, as I said
Doesn't say he is Turkish, it's just repeating the mythical origins of Homer
As far as we know now that Homer was likely a real person born in Western Coast of Anatolia but any other details are unknown
So saying that he was born in Smyrna is inaccurate, as that is not certain but other than that inaccuracy nowhere is it says he was Turkish
What
It's true that he was likely born in what is today Turkey in Western Coast of Anatolia
Ancient cities of Troy and Ephesus, as well as some of the first human settlements amongst others are also in what is now Turkey, so it's common for tourism related webpages or tours to advertise them as they are attraction
Doesn't mean they are Turkish
You are grasping at some straws here
So you saw some person, who may or may not be serious, say that homer is Turkic
So you went ahead to say that "Turks (in general) claim Homer is Turkish". You might have seen that on youtube or instagram somewhere, that is not falsifiable so it is beyond commentary but no, Turks (in general) don't claim Homer is Turkic
So you can put that to rest now
Amazing how people can just make stuff up saying "dude trust me" as proof
I am sure you have, I have too
For example just yesterday I saw a Greek claim that Trojans were Hellenes but to say that all Greeks believe pre-hellenic Anatolian civilisations to be Hellenes would be inaccurate
It's not taught in your history as such, or shown in your media as such I assume
Similarly, pre-Turkish Anatolian civilisations, including Ionians are taught in Turkish history books as completely distinct entities that are not Turkic
In fact the opposite, Turkish history books emphasise the Turkic ancestry of Turks too much while ignoring Anatolian ancestry of people of Turkey
So you can see how making generalisations like this based on random internet commentaries you read in English might not be accurate, yes
Are you dim
Where did I say Ionians are Turkish
Considering your comprehension it's no wonder you think that Turks believe Homer to be Turkic
I have implied or said no such thing
As I said, now I understand why you think that Turks believe Homer is Turkic
Especially considering that you also believe someone stating Homer was likely born in what is now Western Turkey is claiming that he is Turkish
Revolution history and Atatürkism/Kemalism
The name is pretty self explanatory imo :)
We have mandatory Philosophy lessons in High School
We mainly learn about Ancient Greek Philosophers and their ideas
I've heard other Europeans having Ethics or Religious classes but I've never heard anyone mention Philosophy classes
A class called human rights, citizenship and democracy
lol
We have it
They made me paint a wooden tray in late 90s for some reason
Not in Turkey, lol
The problem caused from the translation
It is actually the history of Atatürk's revolutions
Like the women right to vote or we establishing the rupublic
etc
Edit: I just checked the textbook for the course from internet
It basically covers life of Atatürk and his revolutions
History class covers everything from First Civilizations all the way to the World Wars, but not very detailed
Revolution History covers only the Atatürk Era (1881-1938), in a detailed way
At least a few on the Syrian and Iraqi borders
During holiday times, it is usually on the news, people throwing gifts and stuff to each other over the border to celebrate
Technically they are neighbours living in different countries
Yes, according to some people in Europe 1453 was not a glorious year
Do i even have to give an example
Yes, yes I do
Pijamas
Do Greeks get offended if I sing [“İzmir’in Dağlarında Çiçekler Açar”] Song(March) is not against directly to Greeks but it mentions as all enemies by that time
I, once, read on the news about some songs in Greece to provoke Turkey
I am not sure if it is correct or not
No, but I do get offended
Because that song is just a cover (which is like what, 3-4 years old) of the original song "Kafkasya daglarinda
"  (which is ~100 years old), which has nothing to do with Izmir or Greeks
Since when does Izmir have mountains to sing about
It is true that lyrics have changed after Independence War but it doesn't mean that I am going to ignore one side because of it
Izmir March has same value as Kafkasya March which both of them are very old marches
I explained that in Izmir March there is nothing against to Greeks as well as in Kafkasya March it is about a non-specific enemy
Some(a few) Greeks might be offended due to Izmir March's Lyrics and Izmir's Independence from occupying forces
[Bazı kaynaklarda İzzeddin Hümayi Elçioğlu tarafından I. Dünya Savaşı'nın Kafkasya Cephesi için "Kafkasya Marşı" olarak 1914 yılında bestelendiği bilgisi geçer
Bu kaynaklara göre Türk Kurtuluş Savaşı sonrası sözleri değiştirildi ve "Kafkasya dağlarında" yerine "İzmir'in dağlarında" veya "İnönü Dağları'nda" diye başlayan deyişleri üretildi
Just bought and finished the tutorial of ck3 after hours of Stellaris, lol
I was actually going to play as Byzantium and restore the roman empire but felt like this might have been a bit overwhelming on my first ever play of a genre I never played before (Stellaris is 4x too but you will quickly realise their only similarity is being 4x.)
I am currently playing as Khazaria for my first play, not because they are Turkic but a Jewish state in the middle of Muslims and Christians sounded fun to me
EUIV
England, Netherlands, German minors, Italian Minors
England for colonizing
Netherlands for tall build along with colonization to fight above your weight
German and Italy because small nation into OP shit is fun
Vicky 2
Ottomans, USA, South American nations, Sardinia Piedmont/Italy
Ottomans are fun in Vicky 2 because there is a lot to do and you are challenged in a lot of ways but have enough resources to come out stronger if you play well
USA because larping to share freedom to the world is fun
Also if you meme hard enough you have an isolated area where you can have constant revolutions and can get weird governments while still being a great power
South America because it is a land of equally weak countries and the satisfaction of coming out on top of the continent and becoming a great power
Italy
Same reason as in EUIV but not as OP as Germany
Hoi4: USA, UK, Japan, Italy, USSR, China, Yugoslavia
I like the navy and diversity mechanics of USA, UK, Italy and Japan
Horde armies with USSR and China
Yugoslavia games can just go in any direction
Ottoman Empire or Turkey or Sweden
Because when you play as sweden
I dont know
But ı know that playing the game as Turkey is my mission
Antalya (in Turkey), I'm planning on cycling there
Anywhere in Switzerland
Got weird looks as a solo traveler
Probably yeniköy coast (Köybaşı Street)
I pay attention to license plates so, lots
I've seen Australian, Korean, South African, several American, Pakistani license plates in Turkey and Kazakh, Chinese plates in Germany
I saw one from a South American country in the Netherlands but I can't remember which
Also it's not quite so foreign but slightly relevant, I saw a San Marino license plate in Bulgaria (in Varna iirc)
Years ago, in high school, my friends and I were walking downtown near the Parliament building, and saw a parked minivan with a New York plate
It was a black van with dark tinted windows and we joked that it was a CIA listening van
Californian license plate & Egyptian license plate
&#x200B;
Oh saw some from Tajikistan too when I was in Georgia
Lifted Ford F150 with Trump Stickers and Texas Licenses Plates
I don't know, but I guess that's the likeliest possibility
If it were actually CIA, they probably would have been smart enough to get a local licence plate
Came with English so same
Meaning would be meat in Turkish tought :)
At pronounced as "et" means meat
"Kuyruklu a" which means "a with a tail". Pretty straightforward lol
In Turkish :
**pronounced as** : "et" *(litereally meat)*
**called as :** "kuyruklu a" (*a with a tail*)
1) Any other Turkic State
2) Any state with Turkish Player
3) Europe
4) South Korea or Japan
Azerbaijan, whether it's football or things like Eurovision
We and Azerbaijanis have a saying "one nation, two states" - Azerbaijan is, just like Turkey, a predominantly Muslim Turkic nation with very similar language and culture, we're both located in West Asia and Europe, far away from our ancestral homeland in Central Asia, so we share a special bond, so Turks will always cheer Azerbaijan during various competitions and vice versa
I always cheer for England
Well, that's where Turks originate from
Obviously current Turks have more Anatolian, Balkan, Caucasian and Middle Eastern DNA than Turkic one but some Central Asian ancestry remains to this day along with our language and culture
Because identity > genetics
There are even people who are literally ~100% Laz, Bosnian, Kurdish etc in Turkey who identify as Turks due to being born and raised in Turkey, speaking Turkish, having Turkish names and being Turkish citizens
For example you're a Cypriot, as you may know both Greek and Turkish Cypriots are mostly not actually either Greek ot Turkic in terms of genetics, they bear more similarity to Near Eastern people than they do Southern Europeans or Central Asians
And yet you probably feel more connection to Greeks due to speaking Greek, having a Greek name/surname and practicing Greek culture than to Near Eastern people with whom you share more genetic similarity compared to Greece
Turkish and Greek Cypriots don't differ all that much in terms of genetics, both are essentially the same people assimilated into different cultures/identities, and identity was more important than genetic similarity when it came to war, right
So Turks identify with Turkic culture and people despite not being 100% Turkic anymore, cause an average Turk knows that he'll receive a warm welcome  from his fellow Turkic people despite not being mostly Turkic genetics-wise whether he goes to Bashkortostan and Tatarstan in Russia or Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in Central Asia, while Balkan people won't count him as one of them no matter how much genetic similarity to them he bears
> identities being created by minority extremist groups in Cypriot Turks case the grey wolfs etc
While Turks aren't innocent either don't you think that the issue is also caused by, you know, literal Greek nationalists overthrowing Cypriot government and massacring Turkish Cypriots
Or that far-right nationalist extremism isn't exclusive to the Turkish side in Cyprus but there are Greek nationalists and even literal neo-Nazis among Greek Cypriots too
> Anyway what I am saying is whrn the identification is natural its okay, but not when its enforced by others other countries trying to change our identities for their own gains
Yeah but our conversation wasn't even about that initially, it started with me describing Central Asia as the "ancestral homeland" of the Turks and you objecting
It utterly shocked me how slow the bureaucracy was in France
I mean I've heard how slow it is but I didn't EXPECT this much
Their printing machine was broken so they couldn't print out my residence permit and I couldn't work for a while
Even in Turkey most of the stuff are quick and online so I was baffled a bit
Also portions of food were much more smaller
I love driving
Driving to work while listening to the radio is the highlight of my day
My visit to Germany was heaven
Everyone was driving so smooth, so responsibly, so well mannered
It was as if, the traffic was a river and all of us were flowing with it, in harmony
Didn't know you could drive for hours and not get angry
In France it's the same too
You can travel in the EU for 90 days but you cannot travel outside of EU if you don't register your residence permit
It's kinda complicated in France
When you settle in France you immediately have to go to OFII to register, they call you back 1-2 months later for your residence permit
I was in a small town and the machine was broken apparently so I had to wait for
2,5 months to get my residence permit and I had already registered myself when I came as soon as possible
In Turkey I can print out my diploma from an app it's amazing lol and the banking system is more convenient
Andorra: I don't know anything other than the French President is one of its heads of state
San Marino: Oldest republic still existing so
neat, I guess
Monaco: Gambling
Vatican City: HQ of the largest pedophile organization in the world
Liechtenstein: Why the fuck did you give women the vote so late
dear usa pls don't start another war in our neighbours AGAIN
we already have 7 million refugees(world record)
tnx bye
Good call
US and Iran have been fighting small skirmishes for years anyway and it took too many unnecessary lives
Here you kill 5 people, one of them being a top military leader
Iran will just continue whatever they have been doing for years but will have their decision making take a hit for up to a year
Ain't no war is going to come out of this
Fuck if I know
Yea we're just gonna hop onto planes and invade Austria
We have a long way to go to reach you guys
Why do people act like Turkey conducting a millitary operation in Syria is such crazy news when more or less everyone did it
US, Russia, UK, France, Canada, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates etc, it's basically a free-for-all battle royale territory at this point
There is no way that idiot invades you
As a Turk I can guarantee you even Erdogan can’t be that stupid
> recent bullshit they've been doing
Such as attacking a militia that's literally designated as a terrorist organization in dozens of states, including yours
Bro if I had the means to go to Viena I would have years ago
It is a old forgotten dream
Now we are just dreaming of living above poverty line
I understand, I was talking about the "recent news from Syria" remark - Turkey conducting millitary operations there is hardly an argument when literally everyone and their grandma bombed Syria at this point
Saying that Turkey attacks "Kurdish people" when fighting PKK/YPG is like saying that US attacks Afghans when fighting against Taliban or Muslims when fighting against ISIS
One small group of millitants =/= entire ethnic group
PKK has a long history of carrying out terrorist attacks in Turkey and is designated as a terrorist organization by all countries of NATO & EU as well as some others, Turks are not okay with having their Syrian branch on Turkish borders
This isn't about Erdogan, I hate him yet still support the operation - opposition parties support it as well, it's a matter of national security for us, not politics
>  I still think Erdogan is a bad leader besides that though, seeing how "well"  Turkey's economy is doing
Considering that one Bulgarian lev is like a billion liri ot doesn't sound good
Oh I agree on that, I'm just tired of Western media equating ~40 million Kurds to one millitant Kurdish group that has like 30,000 fighters and therefore presenting attack against said group as attack against "the Kurds". There are literally thousands of Kurds in Turkish millitary participating in the fight against them and even a Kurdish rebel group called Hamza Division that fights *alongside* Turkey against PKK & YPG
P.S. I believe the exchange rate is roughly 1 leva = 3 Turkish liras now, back when I used to study in Bulgaria leva and lira were around the same so we sure have seen better times
r/expextedsabaton
That would be too extreme for us
Yeah, We have one of those and generally they are called "Mom's Homemade Food" or "Mom's Cook"
For example [link ]
They serve essentials of Turkish Cuisine like lentil soup, stuffing, borek, Turkish Dumplings and various of beef and chicken dish
In Turkish:
*kopya* (n.) copy
*kopya çekmek* (v.) to make a copy
Depends on the school
Most private schools have lockers but there usually aren't lockers in government schools
You bring your stuff with your bag
It’s not a norm
Students bring their materials with a backpack everyday
Granted, my high school had lockers in classes
So you can definitely find schools that uses them but it’s out of the ordinary
Also there are closets in every class in elementary school
It’s for the whole class to use but students don’t leave their personal stuff in it
Milyon, Milyar, Trilyon, Katrilyon for million, billion, trillion and quadrillions
106 Milyon
109 Milyar
1012 Trilyon
1015 Katrilyon
Well, there's a milyar over there
So we're not skipping it lmao
That make sense
Istanbul
Under my high school there is an old underground church
It is connects to other underground tunnels leading to Golden Horn
Other than that I guess it's pretty obvious that Istanbul got some 'underground'.
There are many, especially in İstanbul
Most of them are left from Roman/Byzantium era
The most popular one is Basilica Cistern which you can visit
There are also many tunnels, catacombs you can’t access or unaware of really
I dont know but surely there is
Because its Istanbul bro
Honestly aside from all the bad things happening last couple years, we at least have kebab and Döner
Lately it’s our government, sadly
Turns our neighbours against us
Number one in tea consumption
>Hungary has the oldest underground railway in continental Europe
If you don't count [Tünel] in Istanbul
Not exactly “Thank you” but we say “Kolay Gelsin(The job you do may it easy to you-you basically wish their job to be easy-), İyi Günler(Have a good day), Hayırlı İşler(Have auspiciousness businesses)
If you ask something to driver, you start with Thank you then say something like these
But I wouldn’t say it is a custom directly to bus drivers but these are the customs that you can use anywhere
Buses are usually so crowded that you can't even see the driver when getting off
Which country/countries have the most aesthetic borders ?
I personally like how Italy, Greece and Japan looks
I quite like Turkeys to be honest
But might just be bias
Georgia looks like Weeknd’s hair in his early years
Oh, this asked recently ?  I didn't know that
Also yes I agree Cyprus has unique borders
or maybe your flag promote your borders well :)
Well, that was not the question but this is really cool
Yes, I think so I could include the UK as well
I see a puzzle piece when I look at Spain
Such an imagination
Congrats
Some people have really good imagination here
You are one of them for sure :)
Sweden would make too big balls
Finland looks better as balls
Sorry to all Swedish and Finnish people in this sub for that sentence :)
As a turk, this shit pisses me off
Obviously, I can’t say anything about it in public because of the police, but it sucks
Kurds deserve their own state
Erdogan is a fucking horrible ass of a human being
Comments are so one-sided
But I don't blame you, the media
Because you don't have to worry about Syria, Kurds, Turks, immigrants
You just sit on your comfortable couch and watch or read the news
And say "Ooo, Turk bad
Kurd good
". I still don't blame you, how the hell will you know what is happening in Turkey
Who died because of the terrorist attacks of this fuckers
I mean PKK
Who died, let me tell: MY FRIEND
Please don't cross the line when you speak about topics that you are not informed well
Kurdistan
I need much more information about that subject
Did they declare a state in North Syria
&#x200B;
Syrian Kurds(PYD) has publicly shown their support toward to PKK(which is recognised as an terrorist group in USA and EU)
[American Defense Secretary Ashton Carter confirmed "substantial ties" between the PYD/YPG and the PKK
Testifying to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Congress, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, the top U.S. intelligence official, explicitly defined the YPG as the "PKK's militia force in Syria”.] Due to this situation Turkey considers both armed people under these names as Terrorist Organisation
For you this might seem as bravery but for us it seems as on going terror organisation for 40 years which resulted 40,000 people death in Turkey since 1984
While this is going on creating around 1150km long fully controled area by terrorist at Turkey's Border, you can't make Turkey(or any country) to shut about it
I am not even talking about rising Syrian problem in Turkey
Society as well as economy can't hold on anymore
&#x200B;
My opinion about this war is ''This should not happened in the first place when Turkey summited Safe Zone project in 2012 which Syrian Immigration problem just about to start
We could have made this easy for everyone
I'm really sad about this whole thing
I hope he, together with his cronies, faces trial one day, for all of his crimes against this country and humanity
Unfortunately, this is very unlikely
You know who I'm talking about, I can't utter his name
As well as USA should have kicked out of NATO when they entered the Afganistan and Iraq and arming a terror organisation which has  problem with another NATO member
EU is long shot dream of Turkish Citizens
With current government it is impossible
But at the end it is not
Oppressing Kurds, can you extent that topic so I can answer it better
&#x200B;
I am neutral on subject of Kurds deserving their own state
If we let that happen like okay now you take a state
Next thing we know, other minorities will ask for it which might end up as same as Syrian situation all around the globe
But if Iraq government says they can leave the country with peace
I am full on board
Taking a state from Turkey is against Turkey's constitution which [ARTICLE 3- The State of Turkey, with its territory and nation, is an indivisible entity
] Claiming might result a civil war
It started in 1978
These Kurds killed 40,000 people since 1984
Turkey has 14 million Kurds who we live together happily
It is going on since then
Turkey opposed “Safe Zone” in 2012 which nobody listened
Now our society and economy can’t handle 4 million Syrians
Why now
America armed Terrorist Organisation on Turkey’s border which extent 1150km and leaving the area without a control
This is a big security concern to Turkey’s Border
Basically problem is this
Invasion is Bad, this problem should have solved in 2012 but we are (whole world) is stupid enough to push these decisions until people started to die
We are really bad at hiding it
There are approximately 14 million Kurdish People in Turkey and we start in Syria
Economical Sanctions will increase problem much more to be sure
This problem can be solved politically if world stops and listens for a minute what is problem with both sides
I'm not a big fan of what erdo is doing in syria but thats kinda true
This is a very shitty situation but you should know why Turkey is doing this
There are red flags for USA to be kicked out but I've never seen anyone to talk about it
USA shouldn't help them in the first place without any control
&#x200B;
Syrian Kurds(PYD) has publicly shown their support toward to PKK(which is recognised as an terrorist group in USA and EU)

I hope I can help you understand Turkey's point
What would you feel if Turks in Germany wanted to leave Germany
Everyone expect his voters think that way
With Kurds, there is non
With Kurdish Terrorist, we have on going problem for 40 years
I don’t have much geographical knowledge of Germany but like Frankfurt Area(imagine German Turks are being majority in that city) wants to become independent from Germany as to like joining to Turkey
Would you agree allowing that
Would be okay if some German Turks create terror organisation to separate area from Germany since 1978
Would be okay that terror organisation kills 40,000 Germans since 1984
Would you be okay if there is another terror organisation in other city which is bordering to Germany and due to instability around that border now they have 1150km long of area on your border
Would you be okay if that Terror Organisation creates that much land on your border
This is basically this operation is all about
Kurds are not the problem, Those terror organisations are the problem
Turkey doesn’t claim any land from Syria
Just doesn’t want to let those terror organisations to grow on our border
Not Every Kurd, by the way
In 1970’s, there were different groups of people who ranged wanting cultural and linguistic expression to independent Kurdish State within borders of Turkey which is PKK
PKK declared self independent
This is how the problems started
Since 1984, PKK targeted 40,000 people in Turkey, without differencing if they are military personal or civilian
Kurds in Syria is known by supporting PKK
USA knows them as Militia Arm of PKK in Syria
USA armed them now leaving them on Turkey’s border without any control
With current situation, these terror organisations are controlling 1150km area on Turkeys border
This is a big security concern for Turkey
This whole operation could have been solved in 2012 when Turkey suggested a Safe Zone right before mass immigration started
Yes, but I can't tell native speakers apart from other native speakers
Like, if you showed me 10 clips of native speakers talking, and told me 3 of them were from London and the rest were from New York, I would correctly guess one, maybe two Londoners at most
I can distinguish by their accent
However, when its comes to for Swedish person
I think I would have hard times to guess
As a Turk, who is been to Germany and tried the famous Döner shops (so i’ve been told),  I beg the differ
But it might just be preference
Likely so
I appreciate that you even remember the names
Glad you enjoyed those
In Adana, they shoot bullets at sun bcz it was so hot
Whole country is still chuckling about this
Adana is the Turkish equivalent of Florida
Adana, Its one of the 81 cities
Its basically Florida in turkey
Adana
when temperature reaches 40°C, they will fire guns to the sun
they're taking revenge
Yeah they are Turkish
even the name of place sound pretty much Turkish lol
Crete however has Turkish Christians and Muslim greeks
Yeah someone threw a handgreanade to their mother-in-law another guy drove his car to a river to cool the car,another person shot at the sun because it was too hot
One guy used his shotgun to "kill the sun"
man, you got the point
most accurate is probably кырджалы. (I don't know you guys have that ы letter, it's more suitable to specify the I,ı sound in Turkish
Greeks with turkish roots probably
Since after population exchange muslims came to Turkey
It gets hot in south Anatolia, and its very humid as well so it gets very hot
[You asked for it
Well I dislike Turkish music as a whole so I'm not sure which one I would call the worst
Best Greek singer
Thank you for this gold tho
People who living with their families are usually kind of people that have an arranged marriage and live as that with no problem
Also, bringing someone other than your long time partner that your parents know is a bit off
Turkish anthem called İstiklal Marşı means The march of Freedom is very epic one
Every monday and friday we sing it at school
It isn’t long,only 1 minute
I think it's pretty good
"Istiklal Marşı" is Turkey's official anthem, and i am very happy with it
Yeah it is patriotic, it written while Turkish Inpendenece War happening, and its also made for soldiers get improved
It is pretty long, i am translating the first words: "Dont fear, the moon and the star at dawn will not stop burning"
It sounds pretty good
Kahraman ırkımın literally translated into my hero race
Rather than that the poet stands on the idea of nation

Hazelnuts
We produce the most hazelnuts By %80
Nutella gets its hazelnuts from Turkey
So be careful ur Nutella may say things like '' It's Istanbul Not Constantinople'' or '' It's been 567 years  forget it''
They're not so common nowadays
Language itself can be real childish easily
You can make the language sound like 4-5 years old
Other than I can’t think of like that one
Edit: I guess it would be “-mtırak” translates to specify a colour similar to what colour has added on
For example “Sarımtırak” means when you at that colour it bring the though of being yellow but not 100% yellow
Mavimtırak(For Blue), Yeşilimtırak(Green), Kırmızımtırak(Red), etc
There are words for and “and so on” and “etc” like “benzeri(depends on the sentence)” and “falan”. “Yemek memek” is to represent something you can eat but doesn’t specify like a full meal or snack or sandwich etc
and this is grammatically exist not just in some words
“Su mu içsene” Drink something liquid(any type to find solution to problem)
“Araba maraba alsaydınız keşke” I wish you could have bought vehicle something like car(etc
“Uçakta kitap mitap okusaydın” You could have read something like book during the flight
Edit: These are called “İkilemeler or in English Reiteratives”.
You can make to “Yedi kedi yedi” (Seven cats have eaten-this or that-)
It just means "seven cats".
Seven Cats tho
make
Food
Most people don't know it's where heroin comes from
The fields are guarded by military police tho
I think most people do know
I even knew it as a kid and thought I’d get high by eating opium poppy bread
I even got fake “highs” with bread
It's a top export here and USA has been on our asses about it ever since the late 60s.
So they ended up taking extreme precautions like this one to keep things legal
In Turkish there is “kuş dili” which can be translated into English as bird language
After every syllable a -gi -ge -ga -gu -gü is added like “sana söylüyorum”—> “saganaga sögülügüyogorugum” (I am telling you)
yeah, it’s called “kuş dili” which basically means bird language
you add a g after every vowel and put the same vowel after it, for examle take the word “merhaba” which means hello; you say it like “megerhagabaga”
In Ottoman Empire, the most competent heir used to sit on the throne
Later they changed that rule to the eldest son
I’d stop that change
So many incompetent sultans ruled because of it
We even had a sultan with mental deficiency that one time
Such a stupid change
There are thousands of ways we could have avoided The Great War
But I don't think I would want to change it because yes; we might have kept the control over Middle-East, but we wouldn't have the modern Turkish republic created by Ataturk
We'd be just Iran, but on steroids
I'd have Enver Pasha die in the Battle of Çatalca in 1913(so the Ottomans don't headbutt Russia, get smacked, and then blame Armenians and you know the rest)
It would be pretty nice if the Entente didn't refuse to give us the territories we asked for (Aleppo, Mosul, Arbil, Kirkuk, and the Aegean Islands) after the War of Independence
Mustafa I in 17th century
My heart wishes I was able to answer "horse archers" but sadly that isn't what it is

I've tasted it never, but people tell me it tastes like ouzo
Rakı, i ve not tried but at first shot nobody likes it lol
It tastes sweet and like anise
it's just vodka distilled with star anise
ppl get used to it i guess, lol
I think it's pretty easy, compared to German or French
Yes but actually no
Learning new language is hard over all but for Turkish it is little bit harder than comparing to Germanic and Latin languages
You start with forgetting most of your Turkish knowledge because it basically opposite of most of the time
Sentence Structure, non-agglutinative, Words are not written as you pronounce them, English words are in Turkish is not much(Only 14% Turkish contains foreign based word which highest 2 languages are French and Arabic by 6%), etc
For a person who’s mother tongue as Turkish needs to start like an English baby to learn how speak English
After learning English, other languages like Germanic and Latin become too easy to learn but still hard enough that you have to try harder to maintain your knowledge

damn I wish I had foreskin
This feels too alien for me
>I know Turkey is a Islamic country
Muslim majority*
>Turkey are there men who for whatever reason dont get circumcised
>how are those men viewed/treated by other Turks & by Turkish society/culture
Seen as people with weird dicks, treated the same as a regular person
>like do you know any Turkish men who are uncut
Not a single one
>do many Turkish men wish they were not circumcised
I have no idea
>And lastly how is foreskin generally viewed in Turkey and what do people think of uncut dicks
They don't know what uncircumcised dicks look like, neither did I for a very long while
People who do know what they look like tend to think they look weird

Saraybosna was built at the time of Ottoman Rule (I mean yeah, Ottomans weren't the first there but they built lots of things and constructed the basics of city), and first name was Bosnasaray iirc, saray means palace in Turkish

Well, Ğ>ß>Ö>Others is more accurate
We have yandex, it's russian but very well localized and quite good
I prefer Google maps tho
In Turkey we have ATLAS
There is no traffic option
Only satellite and terrain, with meteorology
Other than Atlas, we have a map which you can see main roads very detailed
Another one is showing Forestry
There are also municipalities own maps which based on OpenStreetMap but with real traffic data

- Taxi drivers endlessly driving around to increase the price of the ride
Another common scam by taxi drivers is relying on your lack of attention and handing you the change from 20 liras even though you gave them 200, or change for 10 liras instead of a 100, for example, if you'll notice they'll keep insisting you gave them less than you actually did
Or sometimes they'll take your money, quickly switch it out with fake equivalent, then hand it back to you claiming that it's counterfeit and they can't accept it while obviously keeping the real thing, or give you a slightly ripped fake banknote and say that you gave them damaged money and they can't take it while they hide the real liras you paid them
- A shoe shiner "accidentally" dropping his brush while walking in front of you and pretending not to notice, then offering you a free shoe cleaning session if you return it to him as a "thank you" gesture
Once he's done the cleaning turns out to be not so free all of a sudden
Some cleaners straight up start cleaning your shoes without permission, then demand money, in other cases several shoe shiner kids will surround you, as one distracts you by cleaning your shoes the others will steal stuff from your pockets of bags
- Friendly dudes or attractive girls chatting you up and bringing you to "their favorite" bar/pub/club that they obviously work at in reality, if it's a girl she might start flirting and ask you to buy her a drink, if it's a guy you just might start drinking together, then it will either turn out that the drinks cost 10x the normal amount or that the place has an "entrance fee" which may cost hundreds of dollars
A bouncer will come to you and force you to pay, if you don't have money they'll take your phone or documents as a deposit that they'll hold on to until you find money and return, or escort you to the closest ATM while threatening you with physical violence in case you fail to pay up
- "Disabled" or "homeless" beggars that actually work for organized crime syndicates - they're actually dropped off in public places every morning and driven back every evening by their "handlers". Usually they're neither homeless nor disabled in reality, or they'll have a kid or someone disabled by their side so that they can abuse and exploit them to guilt you into giving them money
Said disabilities are often *intentionally inflicted on these people by their handlers*, so if you give them money you're only funding their suffering
Taxi drivers are well known with their tourist scams

One of my favourite mezes is octopus salad
As a Turkish PhD student in the States, I was very surprised to learn that they don't eat octopus here
I ate octopus only once in Chicago, which was the worst octopus meal I had in my entire life
It was even worse than the almost raw octopus I ate in Japan
&#x200B;
TLDR: We eat octopus in Turkey
&#x200B;
Edit: If any Japanese is reading this, I don't mean to offend you
Raw octopus is just not my thing
Yooo komsu
Mezes are the best kind of food lol
Yeah me too but even though we are dysfunctional siblings we are still siblings
Adana, some guy tried to shoot sun there and another guy drove his car to a river  to cool the car
Adana, which is a province in southeastern Anatolia and hot as fuck
Since some guy there got tired from heat and fired at sun a few years ago, lots and lots of memes about it are being made
Ahahaha was just about to say the same thing
I definitely wouldn't. Turkey is only controversially a European country, under the rule of a corrupt politician like Erdogan but the state structure itself, and daily life in general are quite similar to their EU counterparts
It is a welfare state, first and foremost
The US on the other hand is like a battlefield where the rich win and the poor lose, while the middle-class slowly fades away
Cultural aspects are not attractive as well, they promote the need to consume, Christian values and capitalist propaganda
Unless you are rich enough to maintain your life well, the US is not "The Country of Freedom" but rather "The Country of Utter Doom".
No, I wouldn't want to worry about my life in case I happen to have a serious illness in the future
I also wouldn't want to give away my labour rights (e.g. holidays)
Lastly, although I have completed my education, I like learning as a pastime activity so chances are I'll go for a few associate degrees in the near future in the fields that I enjoy
I can do this here, not there, unless I'm willing to pay for it

Germany: Almanya

Albania: Arnavutluk
Egypt: Mısır
Morocco: Fas
Republic of Cyprus: Güney Kıbrıs Rum Yönetimi (Greek Administration of Southern Cyprus)
Egypt is Mısır in Turkish, mısır means corn
We call Netherlands "Hollanda" and Hungary "Macaristan
I believe it's a nation thing
All of those new world countries has no nation
May be other than some south america ones
Even though the exact translation of the UK is "Birleşik Krallık" in Turkish, it is very rarely used that way
We just call it "İngiltere", which means "England
Indeed it is interesting
We call Cpyriot and Anatolian Greeks "Rum"(Roman) but mainland Greeks from Greece are called Yunan/Ionian
>Karadağ - Literal translation from English (or Italian)
Nope
"Црна Гора" means black mountain in Montenegrin language
English and Italian versions of it are also direct translations from Montenegrin
>is Kıbrıs island of Cyprus
Yes, Kıbrıs = Cyprus
>How do you call northeren part
Kuzey Kıbrıs Türk Cumhuriyeti = Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
If the Greek administration that controls the southern part officially call themselves Greek Republic of Southern Cyprus that represents only southern part, Turkey would gladly call them a Republic
Turkey doesn't care what you recognize though
Turkey is just ok with its small beautiful colony in the middle of E. Mediterranean
There are several Old Turkic epics like Ergenekon, Oğuz Kağan, and Alp Er Tunga
There are also Medieval Anatolian epics like Dede Korkut and Köroğlu
In terms of modern literature, there is  the "Kuva-yı Milliye" epic written by Nazım Hikmet, and the "Gallipoli Epic"
If I had to choose I'd go for either Dede Korkut or Kuva-yı Milliye
Not in urban areas
There are mostly dogs, cats and birds on the streets and occasionally squirrels in parks
In rural areas, the list expands to deer, fox, bear, hedgehog, wild boar, hare, snake, mouse, grey wolf, birds of prey etc
It changes depending on where you live because their habitats are different
Turkey is very diverse in that regard
What do you call the Holy Roman Empire in your language
Wanted to know if it includes "germanic or german" word in it
In Turkish, it is called "Kutsal Roma Cermen İmparatorluğu" (Holy Roman Germanic Empire)
It was officially titled as "İmparator" meaning "The Emperor" here in Turkey
It seems like our translators didn't want to spend much time on it lol
But I've never seen anyone call it that
I guess the title didn't really stick
Yes, there is
In fact, the movement had begun about more than a century ago but it only made its way to the official state agenda in 1932
The Turkish Language Association (TDK) was founded shortly after the proclamation of the republic as the regulatory body of Turkish, one of its primary goals being the purification of the language
Around that time, reformation in the Turkish language was nothing new, as there had been strong advocates for a purified Turkish since the late imperial era
Although with the foundation of the TDK, it was formalized
How did it end up
Pretty successfully to be honest
The actions taken to purify the language by replacing the loanwords are now known as the Turkish Language Revolution
Imagine that there was a language predominantly comprised of Persian, French and Arabic loanwords being solely used for the matters of state (which is Ottoman Turkish), and a separate language used by the common people as a “spoken” language (premature form of the modern Turkish which had some foreign influence)
The TDK basically got rid of the rag bag now known to be Ottoman Turkish (which some historians attribute to be a bureaucratic jargon) and laid the basis of the modern Turkish language
ALMOST EVERYTHING CHANGED
Subsequent with the foundation of the association and the adoption of the latin alphabet, some archaic words from Old-Turkic were resurrected and -thanks to the agglutinative nature of Turkish- some new words were created
Much of the newly adopted words from that era (1930s) were accepted by the public, and some were left unused
I would’ve liked to list a few words as an example, but since this comment is now extremely long, I am just going to leave a Wikipedia article on the replacement of loanwords in Turkish:
Long story short, the movement never came to an end
The TDK is still regulating the language and trying to come up with new words to replace the loan ones
Hope that it had interested you
There was a movement but people stopped to care
Only big influence it made was the word "uçak" instead of "teyyare" (which is Arabic) for the word plane
They tried to implement "özçekim" for selfie
But not many people use it today
I tought France was one of the best at that
France is famous for protecting its language from loanwords here
I confuse eight and six, because six is “altı” and eight is “sekiz” which sounds like six in my native language
The word archieve is "arşiv" in Turkish
I assumed they would be pronounced similar as other words that are similar with english like corner and "korner". But believe me they sound really different and I realised that this year
Apperently we pronounce archieve like French not English
Erdogan
On one point he or someone from his party said they are the one who put fridge in house, They are the one who brought water to Istanbul
Some of his followers make him look like, Turkey wasn’t even exist before him, see him like same as Muhammed in some cases higher than him
One woman said “we didn’t have touch screen telephone before Erdogan(means before 2002), we need thank for Erdogan because he makes the deals”. In free market that Turkey has
Soren Kierkegaard
Yes, true
I haven’t met a person in my life that does say ridicule things about Ataturk
Yes, I [worship(people meaning)] him as well
But this doesn’t make me not see his mistakes or treat him as a god
He is a human being with respectful vision for Turkey
I am sure most of people you ask will say similar things like this
One more thing, usage of his picture has increased because Erdogan wanting to erase him and his legacy
[A comment for greater explanation
I honestly don’t think like you
I am a Kemalist and a real follower of the ideas of Kemalism such as:
•Anti Imperialism
•Fulfilled independence
•Turkish Nationalism
•Laicism
But the thing is that Ataturk and his ideals are not thought well enough to the people
Most so-called “Ataturkists” don’t know what he and the nation movement stood for
While Erdoğan tryinf to destroy Ataturk’s legacy those people can not defend Ataturk
Neither can CHP
Erdoğan is trying to surpass Laicism while CHP is letting him to do so
Opposition is miserable and unable to defend the Kemalism
Such party who had once beated imperialist down in Anatolia and buried them into the waves of Medditernean Sea now is following a smooth ideology called Social Democracy
Kemalism is smoothened
The idea of anti-imperialism is destroyed by our application into Nato and the Kemalists and (Obligatory) militarist wiev of our military is completely destroyed by the 2008 Ergenekon and Balyoz plots
Kemalist wiev is dying day by day but the main reason is not Erdoğan it is the so called leftists-Ataturkists passive attitudes and ignorancy of those people
If we could really understand mustafa kemal’s ideals Turkey would be such a different state
I havent see anyone unironically supporting the examples you gave but i know some religious people who dont believe in evolution
There is Flat-Earth Foundation(just one person i guess)
I don’t think majority doesn’t know climate change other than its name
Vaccinates are free so there are few people might exist
But we are ruled by anti-science government so
Anti-Intellectualism is certainly a thing here but i haven’t come across to any antivaxxers, flatters or climate change deniers
Though homeopathy, conspiracies, metaphysics and the occult are very popular here
Doctors prescribing sessions with a wizard clerics or engineers talking about ghosts are common things here
Armenians still hate us, but I doubt they liked us before the gennocide anyway
I mean [Sevres Syndrome] is still alive and mostly defines our foreign relations, so yep, WW1 has a definite effect on our foreign relations
Agreed
I doubt we'll even come close to that in the next decade so don't get your hopes up
Eh, my belidf would have been that if the Ecevit governemnt in the early 2000s hadn't collapsed and AKP hadn't come to government that Turkey would be in or near the EU today but I do understand that there's a power dynamic in the EUP which would be practically destroyed if Turkey joined
The DSP-MHP-ANAP coalition started those reforms but fell apart after the 2001 financial crisis in Turkey, due to poor economic management of the 80s and early 90s, for the death penalty,it hadn't been used since 1991 and needed to be approved by the parliament for it's use and most of those cases were converted into 10 years of prison in a pardon, as for the use of Kurdish language there was nothing aganist it from what I know what AKP did,which was one of the few good things they did, was allowing the Kurdish language to be taught in schools
For the negotiations before AKP we were negotiating to enter the single-market which would've lead into the EU negotiations and almost every party other RP and maybe MHP had a goal to enter the EU so those reforms would have happened no matter what
Yea I can understand that as the EU already has to help countries like Bulgaria,Romania etc
already but maybe in the future

What the
*Reads the text*
Wow, this is great information
Not that you asked, but younger people seem more nostalgic about the Ottoman Empire than the older generation who are more devoted to the Turkish Republic
Of course the current Erdogan regime supports the empire ideology and that's one reason but also the Turkish population is getting more ignorant about how badly the last Ottoman emperors fucked up, thanks to the historical TV series and lack of history education
One of the last ones, Abdülhamit II, which is so praised today sold Cyprus to UK for gold
Some of the new generation dream of going back to those times also because the future looks really bleak
Fun fact: Ottoman emperors hardly had any Turkish blood
Assuming the first emperor Osman was 100% Turkish, his descendants almost exclusively married non-Turks, mostly non-muslims in fact, and eventually the original "Turkish blood" was highly diluted
In any case, they wouldn't consider themselves Turks but Ottomans and "Turk" was mostly a dirty word, which changed only by the start of Turkey
That's why it is surprising why people of Turkey would own this history so much, but they do
Ottoman
The original question does not say anything about colonial empires
If you have Kurdish name you are from eastern Turkey
Easy to Spot
Or if you have Islamic names you are from Central Anatolia because central anatolia most islamist part of Turkey
If you have original Turkish names you are probably from Western Turkey

Her screams make the song unbearable
Gülseren - Rimi Rimi Ley
(2005)
It has a really dark story behind it
The singer Gülseren didn't want to participate with this song
She said it was an awful song and the outfits were ridiculous
When it was time to leave Istanbul and head to Kiev, a woman in charge said "Her thighs are too big, she shouldn't represent us
" Gülseren says that they literally measured her thighs before going
She says she felt like an absolute animal, a puppet
After the contest, she got into severe depression
She was put into medical care multiple times
She lost all her jobs
She recieved so many harsh critics and at one point she considered commiting suicide
Her career was over
Today, she is trying to make a living by being a music teacher
"Çekya" is much more better than "Çek Cumhuriyeti", so I prefer Czechia
Czechia sounds sexy
Yes I do, because nobody calls it the "Federal Republic of Germany" or the "Hellenic Republic" except when you're speaking formally right
You just say "Germany" or"Greece". So why should we make an exception for Czechia
We still want to use Czechoslovakia because we have a famous tongue twister that goes like:
"Siz bizim Çekoslovakyalılaştırabildiklerimizden misiniz ya da Çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklamızdan mısınız?"
And that means
Are you the ones we could make Czechoslovak or are you the ones we couldn't make Czechoslovak

It blows my mind how european languages have ton of dialects while Turkic languages maybe have 1 or 2
Mostly people in rural areas speak in their dialect
Turkish, Azerbaijani and Turkmen are from the Oghuz branch of the Turkic language family so communicating is a bit easier than Kazakh
I understand 70-80% of Azerbaijani and 50-60% of Turkmen but i hardly understand Kazakh i can only catch some words if it's spoken slowly
Usually Biontech or Pfizer-Biontech
I never saw it referred to as just Pfizer
For example the minister of health refers to it as only Biontech [here] but that's the more common unofficial usage
News websites usually call it Pfizer-Biontech: example [1] [2] [3]
I think another reason media refers to as Biontech is because it is easy to pronounce
Pfizer is hard to pronounce for average Turk who doesn’t speak german
Yes, that was an important factor, one of the researchers even gave an interview in Turkish
That is true, Turkish people have a hard time pronouncing foreign words
But also keep in mind that Pfizer is not really a new brand in Turkey
They even had a factory at a very prime location right next to the Bosphorus in Istanbul
Their products are in literally every pharmacy
I just looked up his interview with the BBC to compare
He definitely has an accent in Turkish too but it's much lighter than the one he has in English

A word can have maybe 10 meanings by different pronouncing styles
Even a profanity can be like this too
Oh btw, we have profanities you can't even imagine

Vatan Partisi, founded by the meme of a man named Dogu Perincek who only gets 0
6 every election
The party is pro-Russia, yet also pro-Communist, but also Kemalist, and yet also extremely Nationalist
Now you might think does anyone take them seriously
To which the answer is very, very rarely
Pirate parties usually promise protection of data, uncensored and free internet and surveying the government on their doings
At least the Turkish pirate party promises these
But the Dutch one seems funny with pirated content lol
It does translate as the "Patriotic Party" in English
Vatan means homeland in Turkish as well, but "Partisi" doesn't exacty mean dedicated, though there seems to be a possible connection
"Partisi" just means "the party of", and is the agglunated version of "Parti", which just means "Party".

Çanakkale Gelibolu (Gallipoli)
I was in middle school when I first went to Gallipoli
We saw the Çanakkale Martyrs’ Memorial
We’ve been to monuments for both sides
I remember reading the tomb stones
The soldiers weren’t much older than me
Most of them were barely even 20
It was so saddening to realise that these boys had to die to protect their lands and the others were dying for someone else’s cause
They had people who loved them, family, a girlfriend, fiancé. Maybe they had goals to accomplish in life
They had dreams that now were lost forever
It was a heartbreaking and eye opening experience at the same time
It was in school, 10th grade(Sex Ed only)
They talk about this with separate boys and girls
So boys left for girls to learn, girls left for boys to learn
First talks starts about becoming adult and puberty around 7th or 8th grade
in high schools and the family etc but not enough you're learning it with your experiances
isn’t 6th grade too early
What do you mean separately
Ours was in bio class and everyone was naturally together
Our Sex ED was in Biology as well
Teacher let girls out and only boys were in the class for an hour to talk about male part of the job and visa versa for once
It was very detailed class
Most of the other stuff about Sex ED was together in the class
Oh then it is accurate
It is same here as well I thought it like just talking about sex, STDs, projection from STD etc
I thought it as STD, Intercourse, etc
I still think for 11 years old that having sex, STD, etc as young for them to learn
Maybe in age 13-14 would be better for explaining age
I didn’t think it as start of puberty but stuff about puberty is right age to start
Never knew they made it separately
The one in the middle school was separate in my experience too but not high school
Where was your school, if I may ask
It was in Çukurova/Adana
It was an old high school as well
Teacher didn’t change in more than 10 years when I was student there
In primary school, ours wasn’t separate but in high school
We had couple of Sex ED
Like in 9th was about puberty mostly
In 10th it was an actual Sex ED anything you need to know about(only separate one and was detailed one with you can ask any question)
In 11th it was just an seminar about sex
My point is not about encouraging nor they can’t be taught
I just don’t like the idea of 11 years old kid to think about sex just to learn about it
Age 12 we learnt about thing our body are going to go through, etc
This is normal thing to learn
But intercourse or STD, in my opinion, is not that this age to learn about
OP explained about it as puberty and I understand it wrong at first
Turkey(or rather, the Ottoman Empire) hosted a large number of Polish refugees escaping Tsarist and Prussian repression
They even rose to high governmental positions like Governor of Syria
Another Turco-Polish tidbit: The Ottomans never recognized the partitions of Poland, and would intentionally annoy Austrian and Russian diplomats by asking where the Polish representatives were
Australians and New Zealanders
Our only historical interaction was fighting against each other in Gallipoli
While the war was brutal, it was also exceptionally gentlemanly, especially between Anzac troops and Turks
During a commemorative event, Ataturk gave a famous and friendly speech
Australia built a statue of him
Then we named their landing point after them (anzac cove)
One thing led to another and the public sentiment towards Anzac troops are extremely friendly now while the British are portrait as the ruthless, greedy imperial power that sent innocent people from the other side of the world to their deaths
We have relations with Jews and Israel, current government is anti-Israel but many Turks and Jews love each other
During WW2 Turkish government saved many jews from nazis
Government said "They are our people, release them
" so nazis released and we gave turkish pasaports to them
This is why there are more jews in Turkey than any other muslim majority country
Ottomans apperently helped Ireland with the famine which became known in Turkey recently thanks to some youtube videos
India but its more of a trivia
The english call the bird turkey because they bought it through Istanbul and called it Turkey Coq, later becoming just turkey
We however brought it from India and called it Hindi
Which means Indian
Here's an article that explains it better than I do: [
Qajars never recognized it too
And I think Polish people still remembers and respects us for not recognizing their partition
I’ve lived couple of months in Szczecin, Poland in 2017/2018
One day while I was shopping at a store the owner and I got into a conversation and I told him I am from Turkey
Then he immediately mentioned about us never recognizing their partition, and the guy actually played Civilization V Suleiman theme from the speakers in store
And he gifted me a Polish flag key chain
That was definitely a day to remember
The story told here is that Sultan Abdulmecid decides to send 10
000 pounds
But the british ambassador tells him that would be inappropriate, since Queen victoria is only donating 2000 pounds
So instead he sends 1000 pounds and 3-5 ships of food
Wiki page seems to have the sources to back it up
Just habsburg things
I keep comparing western european wages to mine
Shit's depressing
Albanian Muslim Father
Jewish Mother
My father is one of the Albanians that fled to Istanbul during Balkan Wars and when asked his nationality he says he's Turkish
My mom's ancestors are the Jews that fled to Ottoman Empire from Spain hundreds of years ago
When asked she says she's Jewish
Because I was born into a mixed-religion family, my parents let me choose my religion by telling me about both Islam and Judaism
I choose neither
But, I like the cultures of my parents a lot
I celebrate Hanukkah with my mom and my dad joins in too
Mom and I also don't leave dad alone during Ramadan when he fasts
When asked about my nationality, I say I'm a Half-Jewish Turk
Why do I say I'm Turkish even though I probably don't have any % of Turkic DNA in my blood
Well, to that I say: Turkish is my first language, I was born in Turkey and so are my parents
That's it
Unlike many people think, it is "İstanbul", not "Istanbul".
Yeah honestly I find the sound of their names quite lovely
They don’t have any translations to English but I haven’t seen any foreigner pronounce them right
Weirdly the French are always the best at doing it
We have a city named [Batman] .
Afyonkarahisar=Opium Black Castle<---this one is my favourite
Kırklareli=Place of Fourties
Şanlıurfa=Glorious Urfa
Gaziantep=Veteran Antep
Kahramanmaraş=Heroic Maraş
Denizli=With Sea (this city does not have a coast even though the city is called with sea)
+Bodrum <---this place is not a city but a direct translation means Basement
Kırıkkale=Brokencastle
Eskişehir=Old City
Tekirdağ=Tabby Mountain
Düzce=Kinda Flat
Well, I like them in Turkish
But everyone calls Istanbul "Constantinople". And that's something I don't like, bro the Byzantine Empire is gone, it's Istanbul now, get over it
I think we pronounce it quite right because we write it Sofya and reading it like this puts the stress on the “o”.
I have heard Bulgarians say it and it’s almost identical to us
The English often pronounce it like Sophia
Thank you I’m looking forward to visit France too
After all of that virus bullshit
About the “ı” that sound is actually pretty popular especially in Slavic countries too
It’s like “u” in difficUlt”.
We also have a lot of Turkified French words in our language
Yeah, they had a crazy mayor
He also had that crazy project to change the city borders so it would look like Batman symbol on the map
Ah yeah it did indeed . I think they sued DC comics though
The city is a joke itself though it was literally manufactured not to hurt people’s feeling who are from there
Batman was a village and then oil was discovered close to it so a lot of workers moved in and it grew pretty fast
It’s the only place you can become a professional Batman though studying in [Batman University]
Niğde is a place like that and fun fact it literally means “nowhere” in a lot of Slavic languages
Near Salt Lake
I was a old memory but I remember it as plane area with no buildings for a long time
The more far it gets from sea, the more desolated it becomes
Central Anatolia is a fine example
I always wonder if there’s a relation
Everybody tries to move to a bigger city for oppotunities, employement and better lifestyle
Villages already look dead to me
However, due to COVID and how Istanbul becoming unlivable place changed to opposite lately
White-collars took remote working as an opportunity to leave Istanbul and move small Aegean sea-towns
Also during the last year was the first time Istanbul lost its population
While Izmir (the 3rd biggest city) has on high demand because it's smaller city than İstanbul with more secular population compare to rest of the country
Black Sea region is growing as well
Even my family is considering moving back full time instead of a couple of months a year
Is it due to COVID
Nah
Mostly due to stress Istanbul has been causing
Most people don't even have an opinion about how to play rugby
Milks and eggs are not in the refrigerator section at the market but we refrigerate them at home cuz no one likes lukewarm milk ...
I refrigerate some of the eggs and leave some of them outside
I usually have too much eggs
I start to refrigerate milk after it is opened
Not at all
"Can you pack the remains
" is a pretty common question waiters receive in Turkey
Not wasting food is a big deal for many people so taking the remains home can even be seen as a good trait
Turkish QWERTY with ı, ğ, ç, ş, ö, ü on computer
English QWERTY on phone because of my thick thumbs there's not enough space for all buttons
We have F Keyboard but most people use QWERTY with Turkish diacritics (ı, ğ, ü, ş, ö, ç)
While having asked for something you want you sometimes say no though you want it
In Canada, I realized most people did not cover their mouths when yawning
It just felt weird and disgusting to me
I meant close it with your hand
Our constitution has a famous loophole
Article 4 Says article 1,2,3 can’t be changed but you can change article 4 then change article 1,2,3
Management style
- Article 1: The State of Turkey is a Republic
Characteristics of the Republic
- Article 2: The Republic of Turkey, public peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights; loyal to the nationalism of Atatürk, initially based on the fundamental principles of a democratic, secular and social state of law
Unity, Official Language, Flag, National Anthem and Capital of the State
- Article 3: The State of Turkey is an indivisible entity with its territory and nation
Its language is Turkish
Its flag is a white crescent and star and red flag, the shape of which is specified in the law
Its national anthem is the "National Anthem". The capital city is Ankara
Unchangeable Provisions
- Article 4: The provision stating that the form of the State in Article 1 of the Constitution is a Republic, and the qualifications of the Republic in Article 2 and the provisions of Article 3 cannot be changed and proposed to be changed
If you have a doctor report about a mental illness you can still sue people but people can not sue you for anything
Malicious people abuse this like they insult people online and if people reply to their insult with a similar wording, they basically sue you and profit if they win the court
Sounds crazy but some people do this professionally and the government is not doing anything about this
"Seni seviyorum
Geceyi aydınlatan ay misali senin parlayan gözlerin ışık saçıyor gönlüme
Your eyes shines to my heart like the moon who brightens the night
Allahına kurban

You guys love eachother there
Don’t y’all take 4 wifes
Can u love 4 woman at the same time
Guzum hırkanı giy de üşütmen
Which one do you prefer
Romania or Hungary
Kebab
I hope one day this tyrannic saudi dynasty will parish and people of arabia will see a more equal,secular and modern society
But you must deserve in the first place
Do you have autonomy in Romania such as education in mother tongue
Literally changed the constitution and switched from parliamentary to presidential system (Turkey)
So many things that I can't list here without getting exhausted
Most recently though, he didn't like the results of the Istanbul election as the opposition won by a very slight difference in votes
He deemed it illegitimate and forced another election
People were angry this time and the opposition won with 1 million votes more than the ruling party's candidate
Furthermore, his party is specialised in election fraud
Be more civil and put them in jail so they can’t talk
Dont get me wrong, but are milk-white skinned people able to get a tan
^(Sorry If this sounds offensive
But my mom can only turn into a tomato
Eastern and Central Anatolian accents sound rude and uneducated
Cypriot, Western Anatolian and European accents sound funny and uneducated
Foreign accents are considered cute and funny unless they are Arabic or Farsi, you can face some bad behaviour if you have Arabic or Farsi accents mainly because of the refugees
Other Turkic accents and dialects especially the Central Asian ones sound strong, pure and mighty
Azerbaijani sounds old and Ottoman like
Nearly everyone speaks İstanbulite Turkish in media
(Edited)
Agree with everything except Azeri(?) sounds like the opposite of the way Ottoman elite were speaking
Normal Turkish folk used to speak like Azeri people speaking now back in the day too
No one spoke like the Ottoman elite except for themselves
Yes, foreign accents are mostly considered normal and acceptable but local or native Turkish accents are seemed informal and a sign of lack of education
It actually doesnt mean they are uneducated but somehow people developed the idea of other accents other than Istanbul accent sound uneducated and this causes other accents to disappear so its not a nice thing and this attitude needs to change in my opinion
No, no one cares
In here we have something like that but they are just after your money and it's actually legal somehow
They come take your money an go but if you don't give them they may even kill you
Chicken Breast Pudding/Tavuk Göğsü is a dessert made with Chicken Breast, milk, sugar and flour
Typically most Europeans only know baklava as a Turkish dessert but Chicken Breast Pudding is delicious too
Please learn anything except Döner "Kebab". Döner isn't a kebab properly guys
We literrally have the same food but we call it Kokoreç. Its delicious
Mizeria seems like it could be a distant cousin of tzatziki
It sounds pretty good
I don't understand how kebabs and baklava somehow became the face of Turkish cuisine because I eat those maybe 5 times a year in total and most people can't even afford red meat
I think most people are also aware of things like sarma/dolma and börek, which are far more commonly eaten
I choose: [mantı] meat dumplings with yogurt, [midye dolma] (stuffed mussels), and [kazandibi] caramelised chicken pudding but trust me the chicken has no taste, it's only there for a chewy texture
Also [lakerda] which I put here just because I like it, and [imambayıldı] which I could eat every day
boza is pretty common in turkey too
and şiş kebap in turkish cuisine
Tripe Soup is delicious with garlic, pepper and vinegar
About Döner, well, nobody counts Döner as kebab in Turkey
I don't think I can explain the difference but one day if you visited Turkey, you could see the people, situation and understand why we think like that, probably
You ate everything except the emperor of the street foods, shame on you, really
You should try it when you came here again
Are you talking about [Ayran]
Wait, how do you make  Döner in Germany
It can't be differ much right
I know you use some sauces (sauces are no no) but
>boquerones
That looks closer to something I know as levrek marin, which I make the day before I want to eat it
Lakerda has to wait a few weeks (minimum) before being eaten
> I've talked to throughout Europe also recognized it as a German dish
We got used to see our dishes with Greek names (add a Turkish name -ki suffix and have a Greek food .d)  in West but German spin-off is kinda strange lol
I have tried surströmming, I was 100% prepared to hate it but done properly it wasn't actually that bad
Lakerda is more along the lines of smoked salmon imo, but much saltier and without being smoked
Not much actually
But I should try "German" Döner if I visited Germany for a good comparison and seeing the differences
18, also 2 of the 7 wonders of the ancient world are located here
Everyone should see the well-known sights in Istanbul
But Ephesos, by far, is the most amazing place I've ever been to

We turks discuss about menemen
Onion gang and not onion gang always hate each other
Whether or not sarma/dolma has meat
I grew up with non meaty sarma so I like it better
Personally, I think the meat represses the smell and taste of grape leafs and lemon
Hate is a strong word to use but come on, menemen has onions
tbh every conversation can end up as a food conversation in turkey
I like onions but adding onions to menemen will ruin it and I won't be convinced otherwise
people who eat menemen without onion are psychopaths and should be hanged till death
Truer words never been spoken
Turkland for sure, I'm getting tired of the bird jokes
or Turkia
Something other than a fucking bird name that's for sure
I don't know what I would change it to
Just not Turkey
Oh man, i would definitely change it to something like Turkia or something like that
Something non ethical like "Republic of Anatolia" but Turkey has got some lands over Anatolia and even this comment probably make anger some nationalist redditors, I can't even imagine how people get mad
So maybe something like Turkia, Turkland
*Republic of Asia Minor*, or *Western Asian Republic* or any other name which doesn't make it look like the country is the exclusive property of a single race of people
*Turkey, Turkland, Turkistan*, etc
all make it sound like the country is for Turks only
Turkiye sounds too Persian to my ears, if I could I'd change the Turkish name to "Türkeli" anyhow
Turkland
Sounds nice, explains that it is a land inhabited by Turks
My inspiration for "Turkia" came from Romance languages really
Person who asked the question asked for English name
Well, there are two issues with that:
1) Turkey covers more than just Anatolia, Turkey owns a large amount of land in Mesopotamia and the Caucasus, along with Thrace
2) The word has a poor connotation in Turkey(at least in official usage), as it was(and still is) used by numerous Kurdish nationalist and Maoist terrorist insurgencies
Yes, which I talked about as well, if you had read my original comment
Ahahahah :) -eli is just the Old Turkic version of -stan, nice coincidence though
Exactly, Türkistan is already used(and it could create an impression of being Middle Eastern in English)
Yes, but Turkestan actually DOES exist already
&#x200B;
Oh and, I really dislike Persian loanwords
I'd rather not use -stan
Well, yeah, but it should also be remembered that most of Central and West Asia was under Persian cultural dominance for centuries
That aside, the suffix -stan is used a LOT in Turkish itself(Bulgaristan/Bulgaria, Yunanistan/Greece, Hindistan/India, et cetera)
I personally don't like it since it's a sad attempt for people to show off in most cases and I'm not a billboard but people wear clothing with logos in Turkey
Why is this a thing in Switzerland
Are the apartments too small
Came to agree with the Greek poster
I'm pretty sure we'll be rid of erdoboy in the next election
They already lost Istanbul in local elections
Good thing is, the years of lawlessness and government oppression have "radicalized" the opposition parties for the better
So I'm expecting for a swift recovery
You're welcome to boycott but any sort of open hostility from Europe just gives erdo more PR material, for his bs "taking on the world" image
Just to put your mind at ease:
I am not the head of state obviously but I can say with confidence that war is not a possibility to anyone here
Jets can dogfight, ships could collide(hopefully with no casualties) but I don't think anyone is even considering war here
"-oğlu" means "son of ..."
Whateveroğlu: Son of Whatever
It is actually useful to have a well-known language in the world
English is nice but it would be better if it was french honestly
It pretty much achieved what Esperanto couldn't so I like it
Absolutely not
If it wasn't English, it would have been French or German or some other high-prestige language
Some parts of the world still use other lingua francas where English could not make the effect it made in other parts
E.g. Swahili
or japanese
Iran because of if USA uses NATO as response to conflict, I guess Turkey can be the first target
Syrian and Iraq as non-stable countries which already threatening more countries just than Turkey as refugees
Also having land border makes it worse
Russia, aggression to Ukraine and Georgia which if it escalates, I am guessing NATO will say something when it is near to full invasion of either countries
While I don't currently see any threat, but we do not get along well with most of our neighbors (Armenia, Greece, Syria) and we still have disputes to this day
So, there's that
Bulgaria: I cant see any real problem with them for 31 yrs
Relations are getting better everyday as i observe
So, nope
Greece and Cyprus: I guess
no need to explain
Syria: Yes, it is influenced by Iran with tons of Shia militias, and influenced by Russia a lot
Iraq: Not really, even for Peshmerga (a. k. a. Iraqi Kurdistan)
We have quite good relations with them
But for sure, if Turkey would be more weaker than now, then Peshmerga could be a real threat for us
Iran: YES
They seem really extremist and i think there can/will be only one local power in middle east
This whole stuff depends on USA elections a lot
I love Trump cuz he is a Pro-Turkey and Pro-Israel president
Absolute opposite of Obama
Azerbaijan: Surely not
Two countries, one nation
Armenia: Not a threat for us but a real threat for Azerbaijanis
Georgia: Not a single problem
So, nope again
2 months ago when we opened the Greek border,Erdogan didn't open Bulgarian border,so i think he likes you
you shall fear from the glorious stronk sealand
mediterranian is a silent battlefield in these days buddy  :)
It depends who you refer; branch of PKK, they should feel threaten, a random Syrian shouldn’t. But my point was over refugee crisis
This is not first time that Turkey has taken refugees
>it could be interesting to see the way you see the situation with those countries
Is there any other way to see it
Greeks tried to kill all the turks("genocide" as europeans likes to call it) in Cyprus to unite Cyprus and Greece, like 50 years ago
Oh comment section looks like a mess to me
Let me explain the story for 2019-2020
We have problems on Aegean and Mediterranian Sea for nearly 30 yrs
But in these days the real problem is the declarations of exclusive economic zones
In Eastern Mediterranian Sea, huge amount of natural gas reserves found a few yrs ago
We were dealing with coup and stuff on those days
So we couldnt deal with it
But Greece and Cyprus started to rent some parts of their(?) sea to some energy companies
Nearly 1 year ago, Turkey went to the UN with a theory that Libyan and Turkish nations' exclusive economic zones are meeting on somewhere on the sea
We had this deal with the UN-recognized democraric gov
of Libya
They are struggling against Khalifa Haftar these days in civil war
By that way, we got into Libyan civil war too and Greece got rly mad
Cuz they were thinking those areas are belong to their own exclusive economic zone
You will ask "why are they thinking like that
" They have a very very little island (you cant see it on the map without a zoom) standing around Antalya
And they bound that little island's economic zone to mainland's one
By that way, we cant meet with the Libyan zone
And by that way we can lose our last ally in the Eastern Mediterranian
Another topic is, we got attacked by Russians for 3 times in Syria 3 months ago
EU and NATO decided to not help us with our struggling against Russians, so we let the refugees leave our country through their way on Europe
But why we did that
Because Assad and Russia were trying ro get Idlib province and Idlib had 2 millions of population
We couldnt handle with another migration wave
We had high border tensions with Greece cuz of the refugee wave
Shortly answered
I dont know the EU membership stuff good enough
In Turkey, ppl are aware of that we wont be a part of EU never, also ppl dont wanna be a part of EU too
IDK why we re still contacting for this
About French, yeah actually
We sided with you, Qatar and the British on Mediterranian
We are observing a real chess play going on against France, Greece, Cyprus, Egypt, Saudis and UAE in Libya civil war
Israel seems like gotta change sides
That is why i didnt count them
I didn't agree with you,I want to be a part of EU
Also Israel wasn't an enemy of us,we became rival to them,because of Erdogan
>But keep in mind that both communities commited atrocities
>And you always seem to omit the fact that you invades Cyprus in order to protect The Turkish Cypriots but you ended up staying forever and stared sending illegal settlers to the island
I agree with these partly
Partly because even if there wasnt a second invasion Turkish Cypriots were still gonna stay there forever because it was their right and if there wasnt a second invasion UN would probably recognize the country so more settlers would come anyway
I did not explain the full situation because i dont have to
Question was do you feel threatened by your neighbor countries and i explained why Turks may feel threatened by Cyprus or Greeks what happened after that doesnt matter in this context
Turkey is the first Muslim majority country that recognizes Israel
Sure, Israel was our ally till AKP pop up
But, be realistic please
%50-60 of Turkish ppl care about Palestinians idk why
Even though they were the first Arabs rebelling us :)
But if you ask me, idc them and wanna be partners with Israel again, surely
can you speak it
yeah, you're right
We haven't been a world superpower for over a hundred years, we also aren't one today
Islam will never be moderate or tolerant
And we were really bad at it
Beginning of 1630’s when [Hezarfen Ahmed Çelebi] flew over Bosphorus would be a nice scene to escape
Also it could have [Lagari Hasan Çelebi] to show a successful manned rocket flight
Murat IV was restrict ruler
He banned coffee, alcohol and tobacco
But he died from Alcohol Addiction
By the time, [Evliya Çelebi] was about to starts its journey which will last over 50 years
He travelled to Europe, Ottoman Empire and ended in Egypt
The game can be life time journey of an assassin
1633 - Fire broke out 3 part of the Constantinople, burnt a fifth of the city
During this journey, [Kösem Sultan] was getting more powerful in Ottoman Empire
And became one of the most powerful woman in the Empire
Other one would be this: [Ashina Jiesheshuai] raiding palace with 40 men
Independence War and the Republican Era that follows
The country went through so many changes, I’d like to experience it unfold
There already has been an AC game set in the Ottoman Empire, but if I had to choose another time period, I'd say Istanbul during WW2
Çomars
Didnt read kuran but ready to die for his religion, doesnt know anything about economy, but %100 sure that europe is jealous with our budget
Doesnt know why but keeps voting for akp and erdoğan
Tırreks/Kekos:For those who have no brain due to excessive usage of drugs
They like to blast their distinctive music from their old ass cars
They also like to prey on girls in front of high schools and parks
Usually begs for 50 kuruş (to buy a glue to inhale and trip to) and threatens you if you refuse
For some reason all of tırreks love football and usually a fanatic
Çomars:Çomar is the name of a dog breed but for some reason we use the same name to name our stupid,conservative and ignorant af people
They're usually lower middleclass and they like to own Fiat Doblo's.They're obsessed with Ottoman Empire and approve Erdoğan because of this claims to revive Ottoman Empire
They dislike every religion but Islam(they're obsessed about it aswell)They like to deny every fact that could potentially hurt Erdoğan government
They claim that there's nothing wrong with the country and would like to label everybody who oppose them as "traitor to the country".
Arizona kertenkeleleri (Arizona lizards)
I know it sounds weird
[This guy is one of them
Fun fact: Even though the guy in the picture doesn't wear one, they usually wear adidas here as well
Ours change names every now and then
But in general, they are called "Barzo", "Apaçi" (EN: Apache) or most currently, "Arizona Kertenkelesi" (EN: Arizona Lizard)
Their behavioral pattern is more or less similar to the groups mentioned by the OP
A quick search on youtube gave me [this
Barzo
How are they like
I assume they're not much open to residents of the country but other Turks
(at least that's the case for Turks living in Germany)
Oh that's really interesting
Thanks for the reply
70s was Anatolian Rock which I personally consider to be the golden age of Turkish music, especially the psychedelic pieces:
unfortunately the genre died down in the 80s
Just wanted to tag in Anatolian Rock Revival Project channel on Youtube, which has amazing pieces from that era of Turkish music
&#x200B;
For those who don't know, the genre didn't died down slowly by the way, the 1980 coup and the subsequent censorship and prosecutions of artists killed it pretty much immediately as the 80s began
Man wish I lived those times
Eh, as great was 70s Turkish music was, it wasn't a good time and place to live in
Constant political violence, economic crisis, US embargo and more
Hey buddy, there are also some tribute albums to the 70s and 80s Turkish Folk Rock, same songs by different artists
You might like it I supppose
Some examples;
You can also check Haluk Levent for modern folk rock;
You might be right I don't really know about politics
Azerbaijani : About 95%, almost native, sounds like a Turkish dialect
Turkmen: It's very close and I can understand it pretty well written, spoken it's a little harder
Uzbek : A little less than Azerbaijani but still very close, imagine Turkish spoken with an Iranian accent
Kazakh-Kyrgyz : It sounds similar and we use some common words but otherwise it's a little hard to understand
For French : I can understand Spanish if it's spoken not too fast(About 60-70%),
Italian and Romanian are a bit different, easier written
And Portuguese is almost unintelligible(at least for me)
I can understand Azerbaijani without a problem I can understand Crimean Tatar and Gagauz
But when it comes to Central Asia it becomes very hard,of course  I can understand most of the words but I cant understand when someone speaks
As a Turk I understand 90 percent of azerbaijani but Turkmen thats different
I only understand 50-60 percent of it
I can understand Azerbaijani pretty well
But I can't say the same about Turkmen
Well as a native Turkish speaker i can easily understand Azerbaijani but im unable to form a sentence
Tho it is really easy to communicate
Azerbaijani / Northern Cypriot - 95%/100%
Uzbek / Turkmen - 50%/60%
Kyrgyz / Kazakh - 20%-25%
...and that's about it
If they speak slow, i can understand Azerbaijani pretty well
Also its easier in their written language
But i can’t say the same for Kazakh, Kyrgyz etc
just some words i can understand
Azerbaijani: I can pretty much understand it without effort
There are some words that I don't know but with context it's kind of easy
Turkmen: I can kind of understand this too
Understanding this is harder than understanding Azerbaijani but still not that difficult
Crimean Tatar: Arguably more understandable than Turkmen
Kazakh: Not so much
I can understand some words and some sentences but overall it's difficult to understand
as a turk
azerbajani %99
tatar %98
gagauz %97
turkmen %87
uzbek %65
krgyz %40
kazakh %39
i can totally understand someone who speaks azerbaijani with zero azerbaijani knowledge
thats right we understand azerbajani same nation
Thank you
no im not
like british and american english
there iş some different words and a little bit accent
As far as I'm aware, around 20% of undergraduate programs use English as a medium of instruction partially or fully
There are a few that teach in German and there's at least one university that teaches exclusively in French
In schools, the language of instruction is only Turkish except for the foreign language subjects
Only Turkish but I doubt it'd work to have bilingual education with anything, considering the schools barely manage to teach basic Turkish grammar
We have a kurdish seperatist and autonomus movements
Seperatist movement isn’t peacefull it is terrorism which killed more than 10
000 people including civillian kurds such as başbağlar massacre
Most kurds don’t support PKK however they want some sorts of autonomy
HDP in the other hand claims to be “peacefull” but it is proven that they had connections with pkk
I hope for a kurdish party which really can defend minority rights without any links to terrorist organizations
Kurds deserve equality and they are sick of PKK
Most kurds would prefer Turkey
Which had been their home more than 1000 years
Unfortunetly education rate is very low in kurdish areas and people are suffering under tribal pattern and religious oppression of those tribe leaders
The kurdish people of turkey can be educated and integrated to the society by a land reform and unifiyng policy
We arw all citizens of this country mo matter our ethnic background from Turk to Kurd laze to zaza we are all Turkish
Kurds but not very close to independence in Turkish soil
They have an obvious power in northern iraq and syria but as i say not close to independence in my country
Kurds have been fighting for independence here roughly since the 70s. The PKK has been an active, terrorist, group since the 70s and there have been and are groups in the Turkish parliament fighting for Kurdish Independence, currently HDP is the largest group fighting for it and they have 64 members( roughly 1/10th of the Parliament)
What else can even leave Hungary anymore
Something like Austria-Hungary or just old Hungarian provences
Turkey doesn't have a problem with Kurdish autonomous groups outside Turkey
Current problem in Syria was USA puppeted Kurdish state on its borders sheltering PKK members
However shitty diplomacy and retarded decisions in Syria lead to the current situation
PKK is a marxist-communist armed organization, recognized as a terrorist by EU and NATO
There is nothing to sugar coat this
Putting all of this to the shoulder of Kurdish citizens of Turkey is just stupid and not fair
Turkey should have acted against all those racist behaviors and xenophobia long time ago
As a citizen, I wish there was a Turkey for every Kurdish citizen happily call home
If we want to do this, we can't expect this to happen by neither pan-islamist parties nor terrorist organizations
Kurds are in Iranian culture group
Their main difference is Kurds are sunni while Iranians are shia
If you wanna see how a “Kurdistan” would look like , just look at Iran
Thats impossible
We are related culturally for a long time
Thats impossible for every nation can have their own state
Thats utopia
Kurds can have their state but it must be outside of Turkey
Poison and Venom means Zehir
To do and To make is Yap-mak
Both Earth and world means "Dünya"
Yüz - hundred, swim, face
Yaz - summer, write
Kaz - goose, dig
At - throw, horse
Dolu - full, hail
Ben - me, mole
İç - drink, inside
Tbf Turkish has a lot of these
Swim - Face - Hundred - Shear, all of them is "yüz" in Turkish
I identify with my city
There are not much Turks where my mother comes from so why would I? When I am abroad I am a *Turk* though
If I want to avoid bs questions I just say that I am Georgian and nobody bats an eye
I identify as my town in another city and Balkanite/Mediterranean when talking to foreigners
I would say from smaller to bigger: I am from Adana; in Mediterranean region; in Turkey
Comfortable
I know how to read "comfor" and "table".
But it's ridiculous when they get together
Squirrel
Doing my major in French definitely effed up my English skills
Out of topic but I’ve recently read Murakami’s Colorless and the Japanese character there goes to Finland
Reading it I wondered why Murakami specifically chose Finland in his novel but not somewhere else
I still can’t find any similarities possibly because I haven’t been to either of those places, so could you please share your thoughts on this so that I can have an insight about Murakami’s choice as well
Argentina, Finland and Korea
Finland and Korea, we have some kind of a strange connection
Argentina is just a Turkey in South America, problems with landowners, neighbouring countries; downfall economy and military juntas etc
You made me curious to search about Finland :)
The tought of a Nordic country that have similarities with Turkey is really interesting
Thanks for the clarification
>Turkey is also more unique compared to some of its neighbours
Turkey is an unique blend of them
Have some aspects from all of them
[Cappadocia] is pretty close to me
It's a completely unique piece of scenery shaped by the volcanic ashes of Erciyes volcano and centuries of water and wind erosion
So other worldly
I'm an high schooler
We've got 2 to 4 lessons a day on Teams, also there are 3 government owned TV channels that streams lessons every day
I’m a substitute teacher in a high school
We use the government’s own app called EBA which uses Zoom
But there’s too much traffic on the app so it’s quite challenging to connect
Teachers use Zoom as an alternative which is so much better
Apart from online courses, you can put videos, documents, tests, tasks etc
on the platform
Alas, most students don’t have access to the internet and the ones that do simply don’t care
And the ones that do care have a hard time to connect the app due to the shitty groundwork
We have 2-3 students attending on average
The numbers become 10+ on STEM courses
Though I should add my school is not the best example because most students have poor socioeconomic statuses
The app is actually really nice but they didn’t prepare enough for it
It’s hard to keep the pace in class when I disconnect several times during lessons
And you only have 1 lesson for every class
For example, I teach English
It’s 5 credits so I had 5 periods for every class
I had 5 classes
Multiply it by 5, you get 25
I had extra classes too but they don’t really matter
So, now I that time is reduced to 1
It’s hard to compose 5 hours worth of material into 1
That’s another challenge of the app
But it had to be so because like I said, the the app simply can’t handle so much traffic
The semester is over for the students
The government is preparing for summer schools so kids can keep up
Otherwise, this whole system won’t do any good on its own
I have online lessons 5 days a week, and about 2-3 hours a day
And we use Microsoft Teams
I mean
we have Batman
And some people say that the borders of the city should be like the Batman symbol
It hasn't happened, yet, but it will be the Istanbul earthquake
The most optimist expectation is 100k death, several millions of homeless people and the complete destruction of the economical capital of Turkey
It'll happen because simply lots of people ignored some basic safety rules
Soma Mine Disaster
About 300 people died
>At a funeral I would follow all the religious rituals
Same for me, but it doesn’t make me religious at all
I: I am Turkish/from Turkey
They: Oh, I’ve been in Turkey, such a great country
I love the history
Especially the food
I can not believe food was excellent
If I was living there for couple more months, I am pretty sure I would roll up way back to home
People are so wholesome, friendly
Coastline is just perfect, I never wanted to leave
I’ve been in this city/this town, etc
(Usually follow up with I give some suggestions about places)
I will go there again as soon as I can
I don’t like Erdogan
How is he getting re-elected after what he has done to country
I live in İzmir
It never snows in İzmir
Nope,none (Brussels)
There was no snow in the city of the worlds desire either
Istanbul didn't get any serious snow yet and it is getting very weird
There is a big flu epidemic and people believe once the snow comes it ends, but the snow is not coming this year
TV Sells were popular in 2000’s, later they moved to least popular channel which usually elders watches then it became a meme lastly they moved to Instagram with their scams
Well, not so popular but the "Laz Baba's Surmene Kitchen Knifes" became popular by teleshopping channels ads
[Kırmızılı Kadın. -Woman in Red
-] This image I believe states current Turkey
Background Information: Sungur said, “We built first aid tents to help to people who got injured in Taksim Square”. When Sungur, who an academician in City Planning Department of Istanbul Technical University, volunteered to join into protesting to stop bulldozers to demolish Gezi Park, she didn’t have any idea that she would become symbol of the protests
[Edit: [Video of her
You can see her walking slowing after few seconds
[Cümhuriyeti biz böyle kazandık. -This is have we won the Republic
Background Information: This picture was taken at the 10th anniversary of the Republic by Hüsnü Kazım Önder
This is small documentary type of photograph that shows how we did won the Independence War
British English
Maybe just because I can understand it but it sounds pretty cool
Out of the European languages I think it has to be Chuvash
Most ottoman sultans are ethnically more slav than Turkish, and the language they spoke was ottoman language (an artificial language, basically Persian but with many Arabic and Turkish words) idk if that counts
Also, tall man is of Muslim Georgian origin but guess that doesn't count too
I don't know how but we never ruled by foreign dynasties
(Ottomans, Seljuks and probably older Turkic states)
Atatürk was born in Thessaloniki, modern day greece
Though, it was ottoman territory back then, so it doesnt really count
Well, Ataturk was born in what is today Greece, but the place was under Ottoman control at the time so I'm not sure if that counts
Other than that
Nah
our current president, i don't want to use his name to not get on some sort of watchlist or anything by algorithm
They are Oghuz Turks
Aren't we talking about foreign dynasties like Windsor for Britian or Habsburgs for Spain
Well, they born in old Seljuk State so they shouldn't count
I guess
My history teacher said that Serbia started the second balkan war
I told her Serbia was supposed to get Albanian lands but since Albania got independent Serbians took some Macedonian cities and of course Bulgarians wasnt happy with that
She said in the book made by state shows Serbia as the aggresor so she had to teach it like that
Questions in university exam comes from state books so she did what she had to do
"Avalanche kills (insert number) villagers"
"Markups on electricity/natural gas/water fees"
"Cold winds from the Caucasus results in below-freezing temperatures"
In Turkey, that would be our national anthem "Istiklal Marsi" written by Mehmet Akif Ersoy
It is written in 1921 during the Greco-Turkish War
Although Turkish people are familiar with all of the 10 verses, a particularly popular one is as follows:
**Bastığın yerleri “toprak” diyerek geçme, tanı,**
Don't dismiss the ground you set your foot on as "earth", know
**Düşün altındaki binlerce kefensiz yatanı.**
Think on thousands who lay beneath, shroudless
**Sen şehit oğlusun, incitme, yazıktır atanı,**
You are the son of the fallen, don't hurt your ancestor
**Verme, dünyaları alsan da bu cennet vatanı.**
Don't give, even if you are offered Earths, this heavenly motherland
To be honest
Nope
Not a lot of movies I've watched feature Turkey but the ones that do treat us like either
1) Generic Middle Eastern Country
2) Generic Balkan Country
3) Belly dancers and camels
Turkey is not portrayed much in movies, either because what we hold dear as cultural high points, things you'd expect moviemakers to make a great movie out of, are/can be vastly different from west's standards
Or because whenever Turkey IS mentioned in a movie or show, it's either some action scene in Istanbul, or some political state the protagonist has to respond to
Luckily, you'd not be out of something to watch thanks to our own domestic movie industry
There are countless Turkish movies that try to go in line with western production qualities, and have engaging stories
We have a plentiful supply of drama and romance movies, with a fair touch of comedy thanks to Cem Yılmaz, and an almost annual production of some Great War/Ataturk/Çanakkale war romance or drama movie
If you'd like to discover these movies, I suggest you tryt o get a list somewhere, and attempt to find subtitled, or perhaps even fully translated versions of the movies
Or the Midnight Express route, which
yeah
Yesn’t. I’d say Turkey is both European and Asian but also neither
It’s just
its own thing
"Go hiking" near the Syrian border in an active no-go zone
In Turkey, Official name is Hollanda
Does it count
Fun to visit but most people just use it as an inspiration and then go to local manufacturers when they decide on what they want
Local manufacturers are cheaper and the end result is more sturdy
Otherwise university students use it frequently because they don’t have time for things like that
Only NATO should exist if their government allows it
I think İncirlik American Base in Adana should be closed just for USA
There should be a NATO station in rotation like every 4-5  years in every NATO country to learn to work with each other
Shops specifically for Polish stuff is pretty rare if not non existent (in a lot of places)
But we have a village in Istanbul made up of Polish people called Polonezköy/Polonez Köyü(Polish Village) or Adampol
I don't know how many Polish people still live there
The history of revolutions in France never ceases to amaze me
Scottish history
I like Italy's history,especially Rome,city state and rennaissance periods
Romania and Crazy Carol II life style
Early years of the republic probably
It is a highly romanticized era, I would like to see how good we were at time
Just after the (Counter-)Coup of 1909
It was the only proper multi-party democracy we'd get until 1950
Would be quite interesting to see people enjoy their newfound freedoms, especially considering the still-multicultural nature of Istanbul at the time
It's now within borders of Turkey now but I would like to see the Empire of Trebizond
I have too many questions
1930s. A new modern republic, rapid increase in every aspect of rights and economy, great times, even just possibility to see Atatürk would worth it
I juts know my country's anthem and also know Azerbaijan's anthem little bit if it counts too
I'm pretty sure it would be *Arka Sokaklar*, a police/crime show
I don't have statistics but I remember watching it when I was in 2nd Grade, and its still running today
I had to google it
apparently its called Ferhunde Hanımlar(Ferhunde Ladies)
It has 1069 episodes according to google
it's been 587 episodes
started in 31 July 2006
Its actually “Ferhunde Hanımlar” with 1780 episodes
I'm from Istanbul, and my family is from a city close to it
So I can only understand accents that are close to the standard one, and the Aegean ones are fine too most of the time
Any accent from the middle, north, or east of the country stresses me out, I need to adjust for a few hours in those cities, in the worst cases I can only understand half of what they're saying
Special mention to the German Turks, theirs is the most confusing one for sure, I was just in the market today and it took me a minute to realize two guys there were actually speaking Turkish
Muğla, some deep parts of south east anatolia, some parts of east black see
But yeah, eagean dialects are sometimes too hard to understand
Same applies to Turkish Cypriots speaking Turkish
Cypriot Turkish is not hard to understand
It's just too cute :)
İt snows 2-3 times in Istanbul but then melts a day later
It used to snow way more back in the day , blame climate change I guess ...
It is seen mostly during teen and university years
People I know took them of when they were around late 20’s as they said it is time to grow up
Depending on your workplace but you can see people with piercings
Still if you have conservative employers, you wouldn’t hired anyways
Depends on the person and the place
It's typically negatively correlated with the level of conservativity
Just today, a young student made it to the internet news for getting fired due to his tattoos
They’re fine
Many of my friends have piercings on their faces, some of them are teachers, paramedic etc
Though I should add man may not be seen as presentable with face piercings
Depends on where you are,
In some places people would not mind,
Some other places the word atheist is an insult
Depends on where you live
Lurther east you go, more bigoted they are
Like you could get killed if you were to simply announce that you don't think god is real, or you don't believe in any religion
Further west, more open
It's almost linear with human development
I believe Izmir has the highest percentage of Atheists
I am an atheist myself
It is not pleasant at all, but they are 1st world problems
It's definetely not like SA or anything, but it is like one of the worst among 1st world countries
People can be very passive aggressive about it
They try to assert their religious culture into your life
If you were to ask that question to the average Turk, you would get "heretics" as an answer
Supporters of Erdogan like to stress that we are a 99% percent Muslim country (a terribly wrong and alienating estimate based solely on what is written on ID cards, which is Muslim by default unless your parents are of a different religion) while I'd say that a sizeable portion of the population is agnostic or deist in practice
Most people identify as Muslims but at most 50%-60% of them practise Islam beyond believing in a God and referring to it as Allah
So the reaction you get for telling that you are an atheist really depends on where you are
You either get a neutral reaction or hostile looks
However, the word "non-believer" is commonly used as an insult by politicians and many average people, although they usually use it unconscious of its implications, as in using ableist language in English (I don't think this is the case with the politicians who use the word though)
So there is a cultural bias against atheism
I personally face (especially from my family) reactions like tongue-clicking too
No one in my family has ever set foot in a mosque for decades, they are secular and okay with me being an atheist, but they still believe in God and think that I'll be punished (they don't want this to happen)
I rarely bring up the fact that I am an atheist because of this; I just nod my head in agreement or say ok when my mum wants me to pray for a certain thing
Laïcité is the best
Yes, West is much more accepting, but central and especially northern Turkey would be more aggresive towards atheists than the east but east is only slightly better
Turkey is urbanised in a toxic and random way so the urban population is too large and too diverse to form a base for any group
I would say that most people with university education are non-religious believers though, yes
That is a crime
I wish, i could write some jokes about Erdogan but i don't wanna find myself in prison at 3 in the morning
There, i said it
Erdogan, he is the tall man
Silivri is cold brother
Custom flair in homapeage of the subreddit
A masterpiece
Damn right
But it's the typical joke we say everyday like "Ohh man, that Erdoğan really pissess me off but i better shut up because prison must be damn cold right now
Just a number you say
Well, so is 911
I think Cyprus is an island so big that it feels like its on Mainland and there is no dispute about Cyprus not being on europe, Cyprus definitely is on Europe
I think OP meant overseas territories like Reunion, Falklands, French Guiana, Ceuta, Melilla etc

If it's just three then, Turkish, English, Indian
If it's three more: Italian, Arabic, Indian

İt's Avrupa     Asya     K. Amerika     G. Amerika     Antarktika     Afrika     and Avustralya or Okyanusya
Those two are used interchangeably
But Avustralya is used more because every continent name start and ends with an "a"
Same
Except we call Australia instead of Oceania
Father said: Whole family used to meet once in a month before my grandpa passed away
We don’t anymore
We all gather depending how close we are, we came early since we live 15 mins away like join the breakfast then talk about ourselves, news, education, life, etc
until we get hungry then women prepare the meal, youths carries it to bakery to be cooked in stone oven
Husbands usually don’t come unless it was weekend
Then usually we take care of garden as well clear some wild grass or clean and water the plants etc
When it is harvested, we get our share as well and this is how the day ends
Mother side: Since my mum lives around 900km away from them it doesn’t happen much often
When we visit Istanbul, it happens the next day
Same as close you are early you come
We talk about ourselves, news, education, life and politics
Politics usually ends up with bashing the history, facts and heat arguments ends nowhere
At the end we all get hungry which my grandma hates someone cooks for her so she would prepare the meal early in the morning
Then we return to talking without no politics
Then people go one by one depending how long it will take them to go back
\- Mustafa Kemal Atatürk
\- Fatih Sultan Mehmet (Mehmed II)
\- Kanuni Sultan Süleyman (Suleiman the Magnificent)
\- Abdulhamit II (Currently became really well known because of Erdogan's love for him)
There are a lot more but after these 4, I seriously doubt it can fulfill "everyone" requirement
- Mustafa Kemal Atatürk
- İsmet İnönü
- Mehmed I
- Suleiman I
- Selim I
- Enver Pasha (maybe
- Abdulhamid II
Mete Khan
Alparslan
Mehmed the Conquerer
Suleiman the Magnificent
Hürrem Sultan
Atatürk
İnönü
I am pretty sure a lot of people know Yavuz Sultan Selim (Selim I)
Mete Khan, İsmet İnönü, Sultan Alp Arslan
Just %15 of the populution have a fethish for incompetent Abdulhamit and you wrote him to your list but forgot these 3
I would add Architect Sinan to this list
I think people also know Osman (I), Nasreddin hoca, Yunus Emre, maybe  Barbaros Hayrettin
>Just %15 of the populution have a fethish
The OP ask for people who are well known not who are liked
>Mete Khan, İsmet İnönü, Sultan Alp Arslan
I believe these known less than Abdulhamit
And Piri Reis
Not known by everyone for sure
But fairly known
But as you said he is not known as Turkish
In fact I thought he was Arabic
>I believe these known less than Abdulhamit
Don't think so
It is just nonsense (I wish you guys use some suffixes, don't change the whole words) like other Euro languages (except Hungarian etc)
No connection with Turkish it is just zero, and also very hard to speak/think/build sentences (at least for me but I think for the other Turks the situation is same)
I like German more
Our language is better because Turkish is gender neutral
You don’t have to mess with She/He/It
Just say O.
I like it
I can express my feeling more clearly
It's very different from turkish which is an altaic language that's not part of the indo-european family
It's because of 2 reasons :
People admire Germans since last periods of Ottoman Empire
Almost everybody has a relative who went to Germany in 60s and 70s.
As a high schooler i am scared
I am not going to go to school for the first week and see what is going on, how the school acts for protecting us
Tho i am guessing the whole school thing will only last a couple of weeks because people are gonna get sick, no matter how many layers of mask they wear, teenagers are not going to give any fucks about distancing and gov probably will have to close schools again
In a speech in 2014, Erdogan stumbled and said "You can not preach my children about honestly earned food, although I have never had my children eat honestly earned food" to another party leader Kilicdaroglu
This was a few months after he was accused of supposedly hiding illegal income in shoe boxes

The Clock Tower, İzmir
Trenches, battle stations and canons from the battle of gallipoli
And yeah that horse statue from "troy" film
Odunpazarı Houses built by Locals also in sivrihisar district and armenian church, and Reşadiye Mosque in city center -Eskişehir Türkey
My hometown bolu has the tomb of hannibal barka
Istanbul - Hard to pick one but my answers would be Hagia Sophia, Galata Tower or Blue Mosque
İt is great that you have admiral in charge of a landlocked country
My turkic compainon we will always try to aid you
Çekiç (pronounced "chekich") Bad ass
I dont know
Different
yes
It's "çekiç" in Turkish they're must be related
It's "Çekiç" in turkish too
Yeah haha I think its pronounced the same
not that different apparently :D
Shocking is a bit too much, but I've personally had the chance to see German, Dutch and French people being surprised in different times over the large number of pubs in the city where I live
They weren't shocked, but they were pleasantly surprised
That here is not a desert
Same in Turkey in many households
Doesn’t everyone do that
I’m so confused
Doesn’t everyone put their toilet paper in the trash or is this just satire
We have here too and it's exactly like how you described
I spend more water and time in the shower trying to set the water temperature to something that doesn't freeze or burn my skin off than actually taking a shower
In Turkey, we learn English from first grade and we have spelling bee competition in usually 5th grade in some schools
Not a country where english is the primary language, but my school used to host spelling bee competitions between classes
I had my education in English completely (except history, geography, Turkish language and literature) so yeah definitely heard of it and participated in it
Simpler times
Same for Turkey too
I thought it was somewhat unique to Turkish seems like most european languages are the same
I wonder why english is so different then
Bold of you assume thah we elect our leader anymore
Yep
That's the exact system we have
But I've never seen Case 2 happen yet :D
It's because we *always* have one dominant political party at elections
For example it goes something like this:
A: 52%
B: 20%
C: 17%
D: 10%
E: 1% others
Not at all
Everyone is talking about school trips to different countries while I never went to a school trip except a Stupid Forest and our Capital
We don’t even go to school trips in my city
###Bruh Moment
Silence
We have mosques with full blast megaphones and they use them for every God damn things
You cannot sleep even 3 hours without interaption
I'll give two, one positive tradition and one negative
Positive: Visiting relatives during religious holidays(the eid and stuff)
Most people are starting to see it as an excuse to go on beach holidays, it seems
Negative: "Bride-taking". The tradition of "requesting" the bride from her father
I see the disappearance of this tradition as a net positive because this heavily objectifies women as the property of their fathers
In İstanbul, people usually drive very slowly in narrow roads, but it's not by choice
Firstly there's a lot of traffic even in small roads
Also, occasionally someone will double park so you will have to swirl around them, which slows you down
And lastly, the potholes/speed bumps would ruin your car unless you're driving an suv
Probably most associated song with us by foreigners is
[Üsküdar'a gider iken]
Which means "while I was going to Üsküdar (it is a district in İstanbul)"
[Wiki]
There are many covers of this song in the Balkans and Middle East
It is probably the most famous Turkish tune if you exclude "Misirlou".
Yeah, it is like Turkish food
We are used to it :D.
We have a city called Batman and batman doesnt even live there
We have a city called Batman
No Batman there as far as I know
Not really no
I've been working in advertising for almost 10 years now
Each year our deadlines get shorter and shorter
Even if I got my dream salary, my life wouldn't change that much because I have almost no time for anything else other than work
Kilis, typical Middle Eastern city
With arabic speaking populition and climate
Most Turkish city
I would say Ankara
Turkey is a really diverse country so my answer would be from the bias of someone raised by Mediterranean/Turcoman parents in Ankara
Out of all cities I've visited, Mardin or Urfa felt really foreign
I'm sure Mardin still has a Turkish *minority* which reinforces the feeling
They seemed out of Iraq or Syria
Artvin also had a different feeling to it, more like Georgia, which isn't surprising because it had been Georgian historically
Typically Turkish would be the inner parts of the Aegean region, IMO
But I feel more at home in Adana or Mersin or Antioch
İstanbul is Normal/Typical
Tunceli feels foreign because it is the only communist province
Hakkari Yüksekova is the most foreign feeling city
In Turkey, Izmir or Istanbul
Yes, these are most popular cities but there are 79 more cities and their cultures are so much different
At some of 79 other cities, for example you can be disgraced by people for having a girlfriend, but at western side it is more common
There are many examples like this
I went there last year for Erasmus and it was amazing
Of course
Teaming with Germany in WW1
Turkey is processing the same mistake right now
Let's wait, what time shows
Happy cakeday
A Turkish folk with more Mediterranean touch would be an excellent fit for İstanbul
Turkish folk is very unique because while it carries Turkic values, it also combines European and Asian styles
Which is the gist of İstanbul, really
For İstanbul, i am thinking of an anatolian rock song, both ethnic and rock at the same time, just like the city, in a perspective, it is overpopulated, dirty and dangerous, but if you live there you mostly dont mind those because you are a part of the city now and you know how to enjoy it
I shall give the love and care for stray animals
If loved and cared well, stray animals will be the spice of the city and they won't be a nuisance
I have seen a lot of pitbulls and bulldogs on reddit with smiles bigger than the happiest idiot in the world
I have seen nature's fiercest predators tamed and giving hugs to their owners who fed them from day one
I believe everyone starts as a blank page (looking at you, Locke) and treats the world the way world treats them
It's even easier to do so with animals
i lived in istanbul for a year and never passed to the european side

And I was shocked when I heard you have "İşkembe Çorbası" and you call it "шкембе чорба" too
I know that
But "İşkembe Çorbası" hit me really hard
I guess one of the good examples for this is Romania and their involvement in holocaust
They murdered around 400k jews and roma
England, and Hungary
No, I hope it will stay that way
But our geographical regions are so diverse Economically, Politically and Culturally
In consideration that Russia and Britain is weak and Austria and Germans are doomed
Ottoman Empire would be present with a constuional monarchy and his balkan lands
Considering that all those jeunes turcs whomare present empire would be reformed
Cezzar Ahmet Paşa would be ready to defend Akka
Interesting how Döner had become the late night food in the non-mediterranean Europe
It's more of a lunch food for us
As for the question, It would be one of these: Kokoreç, mussels with rice, tantuni, islak (wet) hamburger
too bad we can't go outside after 9 pm but when this over i'll definitely go and eat some [kokorec]
) at night
unfortunately you guys can't have that in eu:(
A 21-speed folding bike, 3
5km to work and back
That is, if I don't have to wake up too early
It's not very common, just common enough that people don't find it strange
My country was always free
Some Turkish states on Anatolia didnt got raided bt mongols so we were free
Only moment we weren't free was 1920-1922 during Turkish Inpendenence War
Nazi
You were nazis
It wasn't free for a short time after World War 1, between 1919-1923
Istanbul was occupied by British forces and the treacherous Sultan was cooperating with them
Fortunately Atatürk liberated the country and declared that it shall be a republic
Although I would say that semi independent since inner anatolia was free and clashing with the invaders
You probably will be disappointed in every city you visit except Lisboa ehe
There are lots of hidden gems you wont be dissappointed
I can give more examples like; Strasbourg, Naples, San Sebastian, St
Moritz, Ljubljana, Antalya, Bodrum, Delfi and so on
I expected a normal city and found just that, but for what it is I do like it
It was a nice place to spend a few days in, I can't say I was disappointed
Same, They fucked it up but current major is doing great to fix it
What ancient cultures are teached in your country
For example, the Turkish education system mentions many states
Sumer
Babylonians
Akadians
Asyrians
Medians
Persians
Egyptians
Hittites
Greeks
Ionians
Phrygians
Urartu
Macedonia
Phonecia
Huns
Chinese
Indians
Xiognu
Rome
Carthage
Sythian
Lydians
Well, for some of them we just say some sentences and skip it
Like we don't talk about Carthage that much but we usually learn about them in some extent
For example we talk about Sumer and Hittites longer than Rome
Nice, we never talked about Mesoamericans, I think or I just don't remember
We maybe talked about the Maya but very briefly
"Do you know Dan Carlin’s history podcasts
No, are they good
When I think about it, we maybe never talked about the vikings
Our cultures rarely interacted
So, thats why but still a bit weird
I mean our thing is also short but it is like an half an semester at most
But we still learn about them multiple times
Oh really, we never went that deep
We knew some famous leaders and one or two wars but not much else in that regard
We are talking about them actually but very little
Especially before the Discover of America part
Yeah, our curriculum doesn't about America
Not evem the United States of America
Oh, interesting
I will look in to his podcasts
Yeah, fair enough
We only go in detail for Kadesh because thats the first ever written treaty
We don't care about the dates until we go in the middle ages
Of course, we do Middle ages and modern era too but these places are mentioned at least three times throughout the 12 years
A is /a/ as in father
H is /h/ as in hot
Turkish is that simple
I believe it's more like more like 'Hell' or 'Hello'.
Oof, you just made me remember how fucked up the situation is in Cyprus
Fuck the governments who don't want Cyprus to be free
Hey, handsome
Wanna help us topple him
That's true, but I don't think the Greek government would be willing to unite Cyprus unless it is done under the conditions they want, which would undermine equality for all Cypriots
I don't think governments represent the people, they just represent their own and allies' benefits
Germans don't owe us anything, the German government does
I am not against refugees either, and it is horrifying to see them treated like rats here
Even people who oppose to Erdogan are racist towards immigrants, and many are happy to see them go
But the Turkish government doesn't actually help them get to Europe, Erdogan just stated that they won't prevent them from going to the other side of the border
As a result, countless immigrants are trying to reach the other side on inadequate cheap boats, a family even tried to swim in the river that divides Turkey and Greece to reach there
They are left to die
They are also suffering near the border region at night, they only have their backpacks with them and don't know when they can cross the border
It is truly a disaster and it should be incredibly bad to be in their shoes since no one wants them
He made a fool of himself when he lost by a slight margin in Istanbul and forced a re-election
Funnily, the opposition won by a landslide the second time
It is true that he is losing power (his party started splitting up as well), but he is a skilled populist and is currently trying to collect support using nationalistic rhetoric and acts
His days are indeed numbered, but it will still take some years
Mm, yes
Riots in France really excite me
I would love to apply to universities there just to be able to live among people who can stand up for themselves if I knew French
Both
I believe the southern government is a puppet of Greece as much as the northern one is a puppet of Turkey
They disguised as progressives when they first came to power
They were always neo-liberal and started privatising everything, but they also fixed the crippled economy and improved life standards
Erdogan was quite in favour of Western values up until around 2011 - talks with the EU was going so good that many were hopeful we would be in the EU in a few years
They were religious and weren't hiding it (and were allied with the fundamentalist religious organisation which they had a conflict of interest with in 2013 and which was behind the coup attempt of 2016) but seemed to conduct it in a pro-liberty manner; for example, they removed the hijab ban in universities and state institutions
I believe they were still corrupt back then, slowly appointing their partisans to positions in official institutions, favouring them everywhere etc
but it wasn't significant enough to disturb the majority (it was actually liked by the religious rural population and urban lower working-class whose interests were often undermined by the secular governments of the past) and he had the support of businessmen who were pretty content because of the good state of the economy
Things started changing around 2011, when Erdogan started becoming more authoritarian with each passing day
2013 was one of the peaks, when people started resisting his increasing authoritarianism and desire to turn everywhere into a corporate playground
It is also the year in which Erdogan's party split up with the fundamentalists I mentioned; the group, being in control of the police forces, exposed their corruption and arrested many people from Erdogan's government
He survived nonetheless, initiated an aggressive breakdown of any opposition and was still going relatively strong
He used the coup attempt in 2016 as an excuse to exercise total control over the country and made the regime semi-presidential, granting himself immense privileges and power
He became significantly more conservative and nationalist in the past 5 years
The economy is now more fragile than ever because of Erdogan's stupid speeches
He practically controls the Central Bank and thinks his ideas on how to run an economy are more valid than actual economists' (he was originally an imam
), which frightens the investors
This is why most businessmen stopped being in favour of Erdogan, although Erdogan threatens them frequently to get what he wants
And there you go, the story of a man with an iron fist
His authoritarianism is only making him less popular these days, but he has no choice but to hold onto it if he wants to stay
He supports his image using nationalistic nonsense which even he was blatantly against only a few years prior and by trying to arouse a meaningless patriotic feeling in people
The immigrant situation is a part of this: he is the one who opened the borders to them in the first place, citing Muslim brotherhood and stuff, but now he wants to get rid of them because people dislike them - people whose votes are more important to him than ever
I prefer "rest in terror" lol
We would say "Teee anasının amında" (At (one's) mother's cunt)
Ours is much harder, begins with "Bir varmış bir yokmuş. Evvel zaman içinde kalbur zaman içinde, pireler berber iken, develer tellal iken, ben anamın beşiğini tıngır mıngır sallar iken
Yes we do, it's called "jandarma" and it sounds and functions exactly like gendarmarie as far as I can tell
They are the only military force not directly controlled by military high command
Instead they take their orders from the ministry of internal affairs, like the police
Straight outta canton
According to TDK (Turkish Language Association) we took the Italian word *"gendarme"* for jandarma but since French is a Romance language you can tell that it's the same word
Alors je l'ai appris aujourd'hui
Il y a plein de mots transparents je crois
Kahvaltı, means breakfast
Comes from Kahve Altı, which actually means before coffee
It is a tradition to drink Turkish coffee after meals, so it makes sense
It's all surface level
People who actually want to know about it do seperate studies
Simplifying ancient history and then getting progresively more detailed
We start from Stoneage and also learn Mesopotamian history
Ancient Anatolia, Greece, Egypt, India, China(tge last are the least detailed)
Old Turkic states, Islamic political history, Islamic Turkic States, Seljuks, Ottomans and the Republic of Turkey
We start high school at the age of 14
4 years high school and you finish thr high school like at the age of 18
High school should end when at age 17-19
I started university at age 17
I finished bachelor at 22
It supposed to last for 4 years but I made it longer by dropping final thesis twice
Now I am 24 and doing my master thesis
y'all still have conscription over there ?
In here you have to pay a hefty amount to dodge it
It makes sense for Norway since you guys are surrounded by our nato allies
Can you dodge it in there ?
Sorry I often confuse the EU with Nato
Nevertheless,they're surrounded by peaceful countries except for russia
You pay it to the government's account in bank but before you have to file a report
Even if you pay it off you still have to do it for 1 month but it's rather a vacation than actual soldiering
It was used to be 12 months but now it's 6 months and where you're stationed is completely random
Of course,you can put it off by joining university but I believe it's necessary in here since we border some interesting countries(Syria,Iraq,Iran,Armenia)
Does Russia care about Norway though ?
Even if they're not Nato I guess We'd help them anyway
My city has many names, the most recent being Istanbul
It derives from the Greek phrase "εις την Πόλιν" " [is timˈbolin], meaning "in the city" or "to the city", reinterpreted as a single word
And the Muslim population liked it because it sounds like Islam bol, which means "full of islam".
Ottomans also called it the sublime porte, in diplomatic documents
But mostly referred to it as Konstantiniyye, a turkified(or arabizied idk) version of Constantinople
While it was in very common use for centuries, the name was officially changed to Istanbul, in late 20s I think
My village's name was gevurdağ (foreigner mountain) which could also called as foreigner's mountain
Well it was an armenian village in the past so that explains a lot
Don't ask where the local armenians went i can't answer that im too young to go to jail
Artvin's etymology is quite unclear, it was firstly mentioned by Vakhushti of Kartli as "Artvani". Livane is the ancient name of the city also
~~I don't live there though~~
Sometimes in specialized materials such as history books/magazines etc
I have never seen anyone use it in daily speech
Grrrrrrrr
Or just rrrrrr
METU(Middle East Technical University)
Koç University
Istanbul Boğaziçi University, Istanbul Technical University, Middle East Technical University, Cerrahpaşa University in no particular order
My knowledge about universities isn't that good but these should all be good universities
Public: METU (Middle East Technical University), Boğaziçi Üniversitesi
Private: Koç Üniversitesi, Bilkent Üniversitesi, Sabancı Üniversitesi
u forgot Bogazici University
My dorm is literally next to the forest
I see foxes sometimes at night time, just passing through
Turkish dialects aren't so unintelligible that two people speaking in local accent would have (much) difficulty understanding each other
Besides, people from one region who move to another will not speak in their local dialect with people who may not understand it
For example I might pay no attention to my speech to my mom while shopping together but we will speak to the vendor differently
Old people usually just speak in their own accent though
I couldn't imagine asking anyone to speak "normal" Turkish, at most I might ask them to speak more slowly if they have a thick accent
Turkish is standardise on Istanbul Accent
However, talking with older generation, you can use dialect(accent)
or with friends, you can use daily dialect with shortcuts the words, etc
like
Gideceğim and Gitcem mean same but shorter on is used in daily talking
Probably depends on the person
My mother, who's from the northeastern Black Sea, normally speaks in the İstanbul accent but the moment she meets a person from her region she switches to the local accent
I think most older people soften their accents but don't completely switch
Usually there's a slight difference in tone you can hear
I guess it is easier for new generations as they're exposed to the Standard accent more often
Much more strict of in EU and future EU application
By this way there would be no difference between West and East
It's called Mantı(Mahnty), meat covered with dough, made by boiling, then adding yogurt, tomato sauce, pepper and all sorts of spices, and covering it all with butter at the end
It is a truly magnificent food, and I am lucky it originates from my home state, Kayseri
We have “mantı”.
It’s pretty much a dumpling but it’s mostly served with yoghurt and sauce on top
We have the same thing in turkey menemen with onions or without onions
Hmm, I do know this debate from somewhere
Turkey has that original debate for decades (probably centuries) now
**Menemen may be made with onions, but the addition of onions is often debated and is more common when menemen is eaten as a main dish, rather than at breakfast
Man I love Cyprus
My hometown is near to Cyprus close enough to see the silhouettes of the mountains
I've never been there but I want to spen my remaining life there
There's something magical in that Island across the sea     That I can't go     But I can see
For me it is Germany
I don’t know why
I guess old Turkish movies about Turks in Germany diaspora or my lovely old German neighbour who lives in Turkey for nearly 30 years maybe has effect on me
Because of EU laws NA engines are going to disappear tho

This is the song as far as i can remember
Erdoğan
The president
Unfortunately I wasn't able find one unanimously hated as whenever I typed something about an MP commiting a crime HDP MPs getting arrested came out and most of those cases are very controversial and imo are false charges
.... by very very far
Turkey in the past had hang politicians for corruption that doesn't even come close to the daily waste in his palace
Seriously, any second name that could come to mind would be far below his level
Hernan Cortes
Oh hell no, there are lots of idiots loving him, but no
He is literally a dictator
You can find erdogan lovers on the internet easily
They can’t talk proper English,they look like cows and most of them are 40+ years old
The new generation doesn’t like him,they are in the opposition side
That's what dictators are about
At least not enough to win the elections countrywide
At least some people are starting to realize that this guy is using their religion to fuck up the country
I hope that the young generations will change this
Tho if you go to eastern sides of Turkey, people still love him so much
Currently between 20-30% or maybe less
He fucked up the last election and everyone saw it
Now he tries to gain support with a war so he can call for a snap election before the opposition unites under a strong opponent
The way it seems, he wouldn't mind starting a war or pulling off another fake coup and killing more people to stay in power until he dies
An article on wikipedia said that 2016 coup was a self-coup(is this the correct thing to say
) made by Erdoğan
Sınce then we cant use wikipedia here
I use vpn to do research
That is just so selfish
People voting for erdoğan from way over there
1 euro equals to fucking 6 tl here
We are literally poor
And these guys are just saying that he is good, its not that bad etc
Just irritating
They are the hypocrites
They are rich enough to live in Europe but they’d still say erdogan is a world leader
When I say them “Why are you living abroad if he is so good” or asked to “Come back,look our economy is rock-solid” they tend to say “I got my work going here” But we,who can’t move to europe, are stuck sith this idiotic bastards who can’t seem to understand the situation we are in
It is a really fucked up chain of events
I am trying to graduate from college then I’ll live somewhere else where I can be free and live a like normal human being without surrended by morons
A branch of my family lives in Sweden and they are just normal people who hate him more than anything
He's the reason why the more elderly of them can't seriously consider moving back to Turkey, because everything, absolutely everything is between his two lips and extremely unreliable
My point is that it is easier to support a dictator when you are not being directly effected
On the positive side, it looks like we exported disproportionately large amount of dickheads to Europe
I tried to stop that by protesting against it by people who live abroad abd vote for him are seen as hypocrites by opposition side
On the other hand,erdogan lovers love them because they think gastarbeiters represent the Turks out here and they tend to believe everyhting gastarbeiters say
(Europe is collapsed,their money is worthless,no etcihal values,etc
)Believe me when I say the opposition hates the filthy animals who lives abroad and supports erdogan
edit:spelling
The point i am proving is that you cant just talk shit about him like that, if you do, bye
There are dozens of journalists in prison just for talking shit about erdoğan
We are getting similar with north korea, step by step
No, on the contrary, Istanbul had much less of the conservative types when all Europe seemed to have them
It was perhaps because they came from rural parts where they didn't have as many options as in Istanbul and they went to Europe mostly as manual labourers with no education
Now it has changed and there're also a lot of brains migrating
Oh, great
Can't wait to have Erdogan get mentioned a thousand times on this thread
sorry for having a dumbass as a president
Our thin skinned buffoon has been around for longer
45 percent of the country is really retarded though, you can break everything down to its basics and they will still probably say something like "you don't get this yet, you need to grow up
or "It was much worse back in the day, they fixed it and made roads
Azerbaijani is very easy to understand for Turks also Crimean and Gagauz Turkish is understandable as well
One fun fact I've learned recently: "I am lost" in Azeri Turkish means "I am horny" in Anatolian Turkish
So many false friends
The Uyghur language is related to the Turkish language to the extent that you can hold an extremely slow, basic conversation; but it is also not similar enough
I would say they are as similar as German and Swedish to each other
Maybe a bit further than that
There is one Uyghur song that I understand 80%, but daily speech is hard to understand
Written speech is easier to decipher if you make the effort
We also read ancient Turkish literature in high school which is more similar to the modern Uyghur language
All Turkic languages have some similarity to each other
Turkish and Azerbaijan Turkish are very very similar
There is a joke that a Turk who visits Baku will land not knowing Azeri and become fluent in one week
For me, the similarities to Turkish are in this order: Turkish > Azerbaijan Turkish > Gagauz Turkish > Turkmen (Turkmenistan) > Uyghur, Uzbek > Kazakh, Krgyz > Yakut
As I said, some of these could be as far as Swiss German and Icelandic
I know
It is a total mindfuck that people all the way in Western China speak a language related to mine
Also, another mind-blowing fact is the Uyghur language is more similar to ours than Kazakh and Krgyz are, despite being farther from Turkey geographically
I would say this has happened to dialects of Turkish within Turkey as well
The dialects got diluted
Basically nobody speaks the original dialects of their regions anymore
It's sad :(
No idea why
It could be because Uzbek (Karluk branch, same as Uyghur) borders Turkmen (Oghuz branch, same as Turkish and Azeri)

I guess the autonomous territorial unit of Gagauzia is also to claim independence in the case that Moldova's sovereign status change
Not sure about that one though, need confirmation
suprisingly homicide rate in İstanbul very low but femicide is high so your choice
(i explained İstanbul cuz my city is too small to explain)
Depends on which part of the city we are talking about
The slums like Gaziosmanpaşa? Wouldnt want to walk there at night with 30 people protecting me
Richer areas like Levent
I would walk alone without a care in the world
Edit: The City's Istanbul btw
i live in antalya
i feel extremely safe when i walk at night but i am a dude, so
I am living in Istanbul and Makkah(mainly Istanbul), at Istanbul everywhere is not walkable at night just some areas
But at Makkah, there are cops everywhere and no one is messing with you
It's okay for a city of 16 mil
My immediate surroundings are very safe
If you avoid bad neighborhoods you should be fine
Town of 10k. Mostly consist of old or working people so very safe
Might watch out for territorial dogs
It isn't walkable at night, because there is a 2100-0500 curfew due to COVID
Jokes aside, it really depends on where you are
In Tunalı Hilmi
You'd be lucky not to get stabbed by a druggie
In Çinçin
Hell, it's not walkable *at daytime*. In Yenimahalle
Perfectly safe
Although this is from the perspective of a male, I can't speak for non-trans women
I don't think anywhere in Turkey would be very safe for lone women at night, although Ankara is safer than Istanbul in that regard
Edit: Just realized most here have no idea what a Yenimahalle or Tunalı Hilmi or any other district of Ankara is, my bad
Most Turkish historians claim ottomans still would collapse since they didn't reformed theirselves tho

Usually First 3 is the most popular as pizza sauce but hot sauce is the most popular in my city
Other usually used for french fries or nuggets
Also we have mixed spices for sauce as well which is usually enough
Other than mixed spies you have to pay for each sauce
Finally some restaurant might have different sauce which can be ordered with pizza

Ow, my lovely country Cyprus
I mean the Northern Cyprus
I will live my life after 35 in one of the bays of our country
No I am from Turkey
Whats matter
Yep I said
Because its kinda my second country, do not need visa or passport
And also I love culture of turks and greek
So its a heaven for me :p
"I vow to thee, my country
", Russian military songs, "Viva la quinta brigada" (Spanish revolutionary song), German anthem is so cool also
I know Grave Digger isn't Scottish or Sabaton is Polish but Rebellion and Winged Hussars both are very good songs if they count
Also I think Polyska is patriotic song i also like it very much
I like Merck toch hoe sterck as well, but my favorite has to be My Country, 'Tis of Thee
>The Ottoman Mecidiye Marşı
I see you are a man of culture as well
Yes, yes Ay Carmela
The song starts with the line "Viva la quinta brigada".
I feel like Asian and European in the same time
(I live in East Thrace)
Probably thats the thing what makes us Turkish I guess
Neither but I'm from western part of the country and from what I've gathered it seems like Greece is culturally the closest country even more so than Azerbaijan so if I had to choose, I'd say European
Turkey is a special case
I don't live in Turkey but as a Turk I feel the need to explain us
**Turks are European (Balkan), Asian (Turkic), Anatolian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern (Persian) and Mediterranean
We are not one single thing, we are the embodiment of all of these things mixed together
You just can't classify us as one single entity
So one doesn't feel more European or Asian, one feels everything together
To give you an idea, Turkey borders 7 countries with [7 different alphabets] (if you count Persian and Azerbaijani as different)
So, we are a melting point
Almost whole Europe uses the Latin alphabet, like Turkey, and most of countries doesn't have a neighbour with a different alphabet in Europe, yet we have 7 countries with 7 different
We share similar vibes like Spanish, French, Italian, Egyptian, Greek etc
people as a Mediterranean country which makes us feel close to them compared to North European countries
And we ruled Balkans for so long that we basically share a very similar culture and feel East-European (or they feel like us to be more precise)
That is our European part
On the other hand Anatolia has a unique culture
It was a homeland for many civilizations even before the Greeks and Persians ruled there
Till this day the inner-Anatolia feels different than the other parts of Turkey for a reason
That unique culture lingers on
On the other side we have the Middle Eastern influence through the Persians and the Islam
Persians influenced Turkish and Turkic culture very much, probably the main influence till this day (Turks influenced anyone else they came in contact with except for Persians who influenced Turks)
And Persians are very different to Arabs, don't mix it up
And we ruled Arab lands (Levantine) for also a long time, so there is that
And finally the "umbrella" of everything, Turkic and minorily Caucasian roots
We came from Central Asia and brought that culture with us to Anatolia and mixed there with everyone around us but that stayed our main identity
So we share all of these things, I feel like all of them together
When I talk to an Uzbek, I feel as close as I talk to a Bosnian
I don't feel super close to them, but I feel a nice connection
I see an Italian basically as a christinified Turk as we have very similar cultures except for a different religion
How they treat their families, talk and act warmly that is very close to us (Northern Europeans are cold when it comes to social interactions)
I also see myself as Middle Eastern due to various reasons
The closest answer you will get is this: I feel "Turkish" more than anything else
PS: Most of European languages are classfied as Indo-European
So they share the same root and are branches of that family
Yet Turkish does not belong to that tree, it has its own tree and family
Even though we are neighbors to Indo-European cultures, neighbor to Semitic countries or to Slavic people or once to Chinese people, Turkic languages are on its own and share no roots with anything else
So, that is probably the main reason we see ourselves as "Turkish", it is its own thing as I tried to explain
We harbor all of these mentioned cultures in us under the umbrella of being Turkish
I have always felt European because I have big sympathy for European values
Also I have lived my entire life in Thrace so, more asian than European
Plus, as one of the commenters pointed out, there is no asian identity like there is for European
I feel european, I hate many turkish traditions and don't like my country except Istanbul, I wish could born in eu
I feel europan because I've born and raised in Europe and my family are from balkans
We wuz khanz
There is a quote by Atatürk about the ANZACS which i find very nice: "Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives
you are now lying in the soil of a friendly country
Therefore rest in peace
There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours
You the mothers who sent their sons from far away countries wipe away your tears
Your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace
After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well"
Turkey feels like the center of the world for a reason
It is between Africa, Europe and Asia
I (or we) hope
Since when was Turkey = Erdo
Immigrants are worst Turks I have ever seen, they live in developed countries and 50-60 percent of them are telling "Here is so bad, we miss our home" and they support erdogan
In turkey, people except erdoganists usually support Ataturk
1999 earthquake
One of the most traumatic events of our recent history
The magnitude was 7
5 and tens of thousands of people died or injured
So many building collapsed and trapped the victims that night
There are documentaries of the incident if your stomach can handle
One of the most striking ones for me was a little girl, screaming for help under the ruins
She was later rescued but her family members were still trapped and unresponsive
She was crying “Mom, mom” constantly
It was heartbreaking

Probably the '99 earthquakes in İzmit and Düzce that collectively killed about 45
000 people and left more than 250
000 people homeless
There was an episode of The Crown covering Aberfan Disaster
I was shocked while watching it and even more shocked researching it later
One of the most horrible tragedies of the modern times, in my opinion
Apple tea
It's a marketing wonder
Someone managed to put it into the German tourist market and it became the very Turkish thing to have, to bring back home etc
Honestly it doesn't exist in Turkey anywhere other than foreign tourist areas and is not consumed by Turkish people
Sounds like it became a more common thing here in Turkey to have 5 afternoon tea though the whole tea drinking habit came from the British
If the palm of your hand is itchy, you'll get money from somewhere
If an owl lands on a house, a dead will come out of it
If you pour water (on the ground
Literally) after someone travels somewhere, they'll come back faster
Cutting down a fig tree will bring bad luck
Buildings are too close to each other, and walls are almost always thin
It's very hard to find a peaceful silence in big city life
Even at nights
What do you mean by nature
I am just curious because
I thought the Amsterdam Forest and Veluwezoom National Reserve was amazing
I have been to both of them and I thought they were super enjoyable and well preserved
Also Dunes of Texel National park was simply magical
I did not expect it to be look so out of tbis planet
Had such fun time there
And one time we flew to Bergen from Amsterdam with my friends to see the fjords and I think you are so lucky to be so close to Norway and not have the limited daylight and very cold weather (colder than Amsterdam at least) so you can just visit and come back home without having to survive  the cold and dark times of Nordic countries
Never been to Sweden but my friend lives there and wants to move to Netherlands or Germany and visit Sweden in summers only
I am from Turkey so going to those places means 4+ hours of flight and that is why I am jealous and I think I would prefer to live in Netherlands and take camping trips to Sweden
Hmm I get it now
How about Germany
Does it have good nature
Not for a day but like a weekend of hiking
I have always visited big cities in Germany so I have no idea
Istanbul
without a doubt
I can’t decide if Aegean or Mediterranean Region is the best
People who live in big cities where temperatures regularly drop to -20° celcius or lower, how is life then
I especially wonder about Moskvichs
How do you dress to go outside, to work etc
Does everything run normally while it happens
Do cars(especially diesels) struggle to start up
What happens to homeless
Do cargo companies or food delivery work
I only saw such low temperatures(lowest I saw was -17°) in snowboarding trips, and despite dressing like an astronaut(thermal underwear, ski pants, two layers of coat) I felt very cold and looking at my phone was impossible, because my hands stopped being able to move ~30 seconds after removing my gloves
I know places like Yakutsk where -40° is common, but those places usually have very local economies and smaller populations, I ask this question specifically for international metropolitan cities where there's a lot of "stuff" and transportation going on
I live in İstanbul so I never experienced extreme cold like that here, even though sometimes there's thick snowcover here, it's very rarely colder than -5°.
Can you remove your gloves to use the phone though
Even trying to use the skipass was a major pain in the ass for me at -17°, my hands lost any feeling pretty quickly
I work as a developer in Japan too, and I have to write it in English with Japanese mixed for obvious reasons
^(-Japanese are bad at English-)
Comments are full Japanese, variables and other stuff are mixed
I used to be a bit idealist about it and tried to go full English, but then again when you are surrounded by straight out of 4-year university with no IT skill Sato-kuns, you succumb to atrocities like *isKaishi,* *GenchakuCheck(), cdRoll* ^((not "role" sadly))*.*
I believe I can say it started after late 80’s generation to hang out with opposite gender as you described
But Erdogan’s forced Islam changed this a lot
Many of the girls who wear hijab can’t even tell their family to they will meet with a boy
This saddens me that how much we’ve come changed to different direction
Otherwise it is normal to meet people with opposite gender
We say just "Alo" at Turkey and after that we are directly speaking about topic
*alo* or *efendim*.
*aalööööö* is also another variant which tells a lot about the person at the other end of the line :)
We say "alo" too when we answer the phone
Republic of Turkey is founded in 1923
Although if you trace back states on a timeline; Ottoman Empire is founded in 1299, Anatolian Seljuks is in 1077 and Seljuk Empire is in 1037
The Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923 with the declaration of the Republic
If you wanna date back even more Great Hun Empire (204 BC - 216 AD) is known as the first Turkish empire
TBH Huns are considered as a tribal confederacy rather than a Turkish state
They were Turkic, not solely Turkish
Also I don't like stretching the country's history so far into Huns
Yes Huns and Göktürks are our past history but our states is more related with Ottomans and Seljuks
In my opinion, taking Seljuks as a starting point is more appropriate
That's already happening, people who buy property for more than $250,000 automatically receive citizenship, and since wealthy Arabs love buying houses in Turkey it leads to some neighborhoods in Istanbul and many places in Black Sea region to look like Saudi Arabia - nobody speaks Turkish, even shop signs and whatnot are all in Arabic
People with absolutely no knowledge of Turkish that hve nothing to do with this country just randomly get Turkish passports and it pisses me off, as far as I'm concerned language knowledge should be the #1 requirement for citizenship
If I were to move to another country I wouldn't even consider any place that I don't know the language of
Well many locals also can’t speak the language properly so, they would fit in
Now this is my topic
And even ours is worse
Syrians are coming to Turkey without learning our language
But they learn Turkish by being in Turkish people
We cannot even tax their shops because they have no ID
Some of these refugees go to their own country in holidays
And the government is helping them worth of billioms of dollars while its own citizens try to end a month with a minimum wage of $350
And government is giving them citizenship
Thoughts
> ugh, i thought only some tax haven carraibean islands do that :/ that's not how it should work
Foreign investment is good for currently struggling Turkish economy, plus the property developers are obviously lining up the pockets of our political leadership with cash, so they're happy to sell our country for $250k a piece
Damn shame
> That's a bit tough statement
Don't you think it's fine if they come knowing only basics, as long as they're ready to learn
I'm a very social and talkative person, so the language barrier is a big no-no for me
For instance I grew up in Russia and returned to Turkey in my teens, I know Turkish and don't have an accent but I'm not as articulate with Turkish language as people who grew up here and obviously my vocabulary isn't as rich as it is in Russian cause I didn't receive Turkish education or read as many books in Turkish as I did in Russian language
This alone kills me and gets in the way of socializing for me the way I did back in Moscow, if even having lesser vocabulary than locals is frustrating I can't even imagine moving to another country where I don't speak language at all
The issue I take with Arabs is lack of integration or desire to learn the local language, an average Arab in Turkey only hangs out with other Arabs, doesn't know Turkish much, only shops at Arabic shops and buys his meat at Arab butchers, goes to Arabic barbers and Arabic restaurants, etc, which results in neighborhoods and cities with big migrant Arab populations slowly transforming into full-blown Arab territories with women in burkas and men with bushy beards, long white dresses and sandals all over the place, Arabic shop signs and ads on every corner, people speaking Arabic everywhere
It pisses off locals and ramps up the fears of Arabization and Islamization of Turkey, plus ruins the perception of Turkey for other foreigners who visit and see that stuff and might assume these people are Turkish and this is what Turkey normally looks like
-once a week check out the bowls of neighbourhood cats, if empty fill with food (anything edible, those bastards don’t pick food)
-leave the apartment door open so animals can get warm inside during winter
-If it’s a religious day people share food with each other in an apartment
sometimes in turns sometimes all together
-local market, butcher, tailor etc knows everyone in the neighbourhood
You can enjoy a cup of tea any time during the day
-Everyone knows everyone this has advantages and disadvantages
People get together to help you when you re down but you don’t have much privacy
The old babushkas will know about your love life more than you
Being good, sociable and helpful neighbours is very important around here
But I personally hate this notion since it usually results in people gossipping about you and being too curious about what you do, who you're with and etc
So all I do is to say good morning/evening/night when I see them
Other than that, I don't know their names
It is common for our family to know our neighbours
My mum knows 6-7 neighbours in our apartment which helped us or we helped them since we moved in
For example, our next door neighbour lost their just in same week but since we were close to them they told us and we helped them to find a job
And our neighbour in 6th floor helped to pass chemistry test by giving me free private lesson in 4 in the morning
At least for us having good relationship with neighbours helps a lot even if you won’t expected it
Even if there is proverb for it “Don’t buy a house, obtain(gain) a neighbour” “Ev alma, komşu al”
Your comment made me laugh and also made me relieved that I am not alone lol
I even missed the bus a couple of times because of waiting inside
Cat
I am student that studies politics in Ankara it s really easy yo get to the university it only takes 5minutes
İ Am highschool student this is my school way
10 minute walk
8 minute metro (İstanbul)
10 minute walk
total 28 minute
Attila (hungarian) i love this name because atilla is same name in hungarian and turkish
Nikos
I would like to be called Nikos
Sounds like name for pizza tbh
gangster wolfs .street culture
Moving out is only socially accepted when you get married or your parents are not old and can take care of themselves both physically and economically
You are expected to stay home and help with house income
Even if you move out you re still pressured to keep in touch with your family on bidaily basis at least
Family comes first before individualism
Exactly the same here in Turkey
But traditions play a role as well as economical conditions
Things hard to accept but still truth, oof
unfortunately most turk people only know my good boy vlad the impaler and nothing else about romania
My name basically is street name in Poland
[Kantaka]
We don't have camels and don't like Arabic Culture that much in Turkey
It's like a combination of East's and West's culture
And a little Mediterranean culture
Most of population is muslim
But much more secular than other East/Muslim Countries
Our people are warm, hospitable and love teaching culture to tourists
It has a very rich food culture as well
As geographical and historical you can find a lot to visit
I am watching it for the first time
I was in Vienna these days last year, it is nice to see the city again even if it is on the TV :)
Same
I really love it
Turkey has the world's highest density of archaeological sites per area, world's oldest temple in Göbeklitepe (though an older one has recently been found nearby) and 2 of the 7 wonders of the ancient world
To make up for all this pre-Turkish achievements, modern Turkey has more skyscrapers than all Europe combined except Russia
I can tell lots of fun facts if you are interested in dark humor
In rural Anatolia, throwing and breaking eggs on the head/body of the groom at the wedding night is a tradition
I have no idea about the origins of the tradition
A similar thing exists within conscription traditions
The first day that you have less than 100 days to finish your service, people throw things at you, eggs or whatever they have until you become a walking mess
In return, you offer them food and drinks to celebrate
Yes, indeed
In Turkey, those lowlife leaders still think they are a good thing that makes Turkey a civilised country
Nobody asks the people anyway
I don't know Istanbul but the country has 89 operative and 46 under  construction buildings over 150 meters
I counted 52 on this page:
Definitely sütlaç. It's basically a rice pudding made with milk
Mostly consumed by the workers/peasants
Ottoman Empire was a Turkish empire
Wrong it was an empire of one very mixed family, turks were nothing but one of  their many subjects and usually the most ignored one
There are thousands of pre ottoman relics from older Turkic empires all around Anatolia but you can hardly find an ottoman investment other than one or two big buildings
Turks originate from middle east
We are part of the middle east
He means we are not originally from middle east
We are from Asia/Siberia
We lived there for thousand year and came to anatolia in 1071 with Malazgirt war
Ottoman Empire,we only learned just good sides of Ottoman Empire
It was a powerful empire in 15th,16th and 17th centuries,it conquered lots of lands and ruled these lands with justice
In my opinion all empires in the world weren't good or weren't bad
They ruled theirown lands and one day they felt
Wıth good rulers, Ottoman was cool and just but with time and the effect of Islam, we fucked up bad
We learned about all it's rulers in history, and the Siege of Constantinople and stuff, then we learned about The Ottoman Empire in WW1
Thank to Kara Mustafa Paşa for that : )
Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Yokohama, Hiroshima, Nagasaki
Not sure if these are cities:
Okinawa, Hokkaido, Shibuya
Erdoğan by far
Even a majority of his voters don’t really support him
He’s done more harm to the country than any other
He’s undermined the secular and modern views of Atatürk
He’s set the country waaay back
All our neighbours hate us
Economy has been going downhill for years
The unemployment rates are skyrocketed
Tax money is being spent on useless shit nobody ever uses just so he can claim we’re progressing
We are not
Constructing roads isn’t progress
You’d think a party known for their roads would know how to make a decent one
They can’t even deliver that right
Corruption EVERYWHERE
We make politicians and selected few richer while we’re getting poorer day by day
Left has always seen his bullshit
The main nationalist right wing party (MHP) used to oppose AKP but they’re supporting them now which is costing them voters
Some of AKP voters aren’t so happy about the party but they think it’s the “lesser evil”. The die hard fans, I have no words for
I can’t wait for that scum bag to be yeeted out of the politics
For some Erdogan, for some Kılıçdaroğlu, for some Babacan
But everyone hates Perinçek, who, for some reason, is considered nationally relevant despite getting 0
22% of the vote
I think he has switched ideologies a total of five times
How many votes does DENK get
Is it something fully Turkish
Sounds familiar
Sorry my English is not good, did you use 'occupy' as a bad meaning
And I guess "2e kamer" is the name of the Dutch Parliament
In the districts with immigrant density, I believe
Ah, in Turkish we use it for someone who doesn't deserves to be there
For example opposition leaders are oftenly say that Erdoğan occupies the Presidential seat
Thanks for the explanation, I know Dutch politics better now :)
i know some people who do it on pans, but i prefer using a machine where it presses the breads into each other and they get crispier easier
we callt hem tost
Its called "tost" here in Turkey, it has lots of different versions, but the one you can find everywhere is with kaşar(some kind of cheese) and sucuk(some kind of dried meat)
Hosting millions of refugees so they don't ruin your precious countries
Can't say I agree with how erdo's doing stuff
But its just politics I guess
A better example of not nice would be sinking refugee boats and leaving them to die I think
Greece seems to be doing it with no repercussions
The Last Sultan of Ottoman Empire
Boyfriend killed his girlfriend(ex
) and shared on instagram as it is finished with date and time
Admitting to killing her
This type of male violence against woman has upraised under current government which they don’t so shit about it
Other than citizen, celebrities are doing ads or public speeches to educate people and woman who is under abusive relationship to survive if there will be an attack like this
Mass suicides
4 family member killed themselves with cyanide because of living difficulties due to too many debt which made them nearly impossible to survive without any help
Same as a father did this to his family
Killing the mother, kid(s?) and himself with cyanide
Erdoğan’s university diploma
Somebody sued him for not having any university diploma or diploma which given under education which is less 4 year and this means he is illegally president of Turkey since 2014 (not 2002)
I think current situation is now in EHRC
Any citizen with connection to government is spending our taxes as in their private life
Imagine person who worked for around 1,500€ 3 years ago won 500,000€ bid to use as commercial of 2 most iconic and historic building in Istanbul
Other part is that Istanbul Major(opposite of Erdogan) which biggest city by economics did go in as well but didn’t called in for bid
This is against the law and now they are suing this bid
A father wanted to investigate his daughters murder
They said it was suicide but Criminal Lab and other scientific departments said this can be suicide by evidence
Now case’s statue changed to murder
I don’t which side what defence is doing but they wanted to father into mental hospital due to his daughter’s death
He just wants justice to person who did this to his daughter
Edit: Changed the years in Erdogan
Our economy
Yes, Black Sea Region
They use fish as like salt
It is everywhere
>>not knowing some words
Is there also a standard form of Hungarian that is free from dialects, like Hochdeutsch or Istanbul Turkish
If yes, do people use that form while interacting with people from other regions
Oh thanks a lot for the explanation really
Here the standard is Istanbul Turkish, and it's also more or less the written form
But some suffixes are shortened in all dialects (e.g. the future tense suffix) so those are always different in written Turkish
The differences are mainly based on accent and intonation in addition to the pronunciation of suffixes in general
Regional differences also exist among some words, which are typically influenced by the neighbour languages or archaic words
In general, you can identify the region one comes from quite accurately judging by the accent and the words used, if any
But the more educated one is, the more likely s/he is to speak the standard form, or at least try to do so
Having a strong accent is typically tried to be avoided as it is perceived a bit too rural in general
Before 2018, General Staff of Turkish Republic was the highest branch of the army and didin't connected to Ministry of Defence, after 2018 it attached to Ministry of Defence and rhe ministry become the highest branch
I'm not a muslim
i hate tea and baklava
I don't drink tea
How do you do, fellow Kafir
More than %90 of the Turks in Turkey are muslim
At least thats what they say
They do, people still think Turkey is an islamic country and cant handle the thruth that people can be non-muslim
Of course i am not talking about every single person in Turkey but they are a  large majority, simply the same people who voted for Erdoğan for years
To my friends, yes
To my family, no
They can be very fanatic about islam, so it is better that way since we consider the fact that i am still living with them
I’m so French to that subject
— that means I know nothing about it
"Being French to a subject" means having no idea/info about that subject
But I don't know the origin of the saying
Being 'French' to something, meaning not knowing anything about the subject
This may sound weird but youtube channel Kraut which is an Austrian youtube channel made a  [3 part serie for history of Turkey in English (I linked the first video)] This semi documentary starts from Central Asian Turks to Erdoğan
I would recommand it
3 episodes and 4 hours
It's really a great documentary
I'd also like to recommend Kraut on YouTube not only for his Turkish Series which were truly brilliant, but also for his other stuff as well
Turkish oil wrestling - a local traditional national sport that has been around for centuries
Men wear nothing but tight leather shorts (!), rub tons of oil on each other - you're supposed to rub oil on your opponent and he's supposed to rub it on you as a sign of mutual respect (!!), then these hairy, oily, shiny, muscular half-naked guys wrestle in front of the public and the whole point is to put your hands inside of your opponent's shorts as deep as possible (!!!), and if you defeat an older wrestler you then kiss his hand (!!!!)
And yes, it looks as homoerotic as it sounds
Can't make this shit up
EDIT: here's a video for you guys -
When you come to visit your significant other’s family to ask their permission to marry, your SO makes coffee to serve
If it is salty, it means she doesn’t want to marry to you
If it is sweet or way to sweet, she definitely wants to marry you and you drink all of it to show you really want this marriage
But now, uneducated people changed this into only salt coffee and you have to drink it all to show your intention to this marriage as well as to show how rough a guy you are
Some people made it worst that they put, eggs and other stuff into to coffee to make it harder challenge which ended up killing the their future husband
My grandparents does the same
We even have soup version of this and I always wonder why
I don’t know if they air this on Christmas time in Turkey, too but they definitely air Looney Tunes and Disney dubbed cartoons in the morning and Home Alone during the day and finish up with some good films at the end during first day of the year
It is, lol
Somebody needs to capitalize on this and organize trips to oil wrestling tournaments for gay tourist groups
Hell, I'm sure some might want to participate as well and not just watch
> Turkey
you have some explaining to do
Fun fact: Homosexuality got decriminalized in the Ottoman Empire in 1858
Decades earlier than most other countries
Which may or may not be connected to this wrestling
Enver Pasha was really not a cool dude
For Turkey or formerly Ottoman Empire, the dumbest 2 things were:
1st while controlling the seas (the Mediterranean) granting nations to use the seas in exchange for money
We didn't realize the power of it until it was too late
While we had the power for more than hundreds of years, we could have controlled all European countries + would have our own access to South America, Africa and Asia
We gave that away basically for peanuts
2nd dumbest thing was to push forward to the West a.k.a underestimating the Russians
The Russians were settled in a tiny village when we were across 3 continents
Underestimating them and giving them space and letting them evolve freely in our steppes was a big mistake
Instead of pushing to Vienna, we should have pushed for North (above Crimea) and seal the deal with the Cental Asian steppes where already Turkic people lived for centuries
The reason why the Ottomans fell apart was the Russians
We got our asses kicked a lot by them because our focus was in the West
caring religion too fucking much and ignoring science developments
Don't forget the time when the Sultan (Osman II) was overthrown and tortured (and allegedly raped) to death for wanting to do army reforms
Liechtenstein ’s is pretty unique, I don’t see any competition here
Winner is clear
Luxemburg and Netherlands because of their color
I just like yellow lisance plates
Iconic design of the classic UK plates are also amazing, but their plastic material looks quite unsatisfying
Also, their europanized lisance plates looks horrible
I also like tiny versions of the Italian, Finnish and Swedish lisance plates
We learn and write it without a line
Z with the line is very rare
Maybe, it was more frequent in many decades before
Honestly, I've seen both
I write it without a line though
Mostly without a line but i saw lot of people write with line
About 30% of the people use 2 or more names
Most of the time, one of it is one of your dads parent's name and other one is the name that your mom wants
Those names are used like 2 main names rather than a main and middle name
Me and most of my friends uses one name with his relatives and other name for friends or other people
Generally, your family uses the ancestral name and friends use the shorter one if there is no one with same your name
But it depends of course

Basically this girl with a Kangal:
Maybe throw in a Turkish cat and she lives in the maiden's tower
Tomyris could be a nice representation of Turkish women
But i can't imagine it as a child movie lmao
>What do they look like
Thanks to our ancestors, we have no idea
Lmao
Just put some random central asian women on the role and we will be ok
Eheheeh
>Do they have an animal sidekick
Her horse of course
She was a shaman
>Magical powers
She was a ruler of a civilitation where women had a voice and treated respectful and almost equally with men
And it was 2000+ years ago
Isn't that magical enough
Edit: Google says that she was the first woman ruler
Soo, that's also sound magical
They sacrifice themselves for Soviet Russia
[Göbekli Tepe] [Hagia Sophia] [Sultan Ahmet Mosque(Blue Mosque)] - Each building has a unique style and a history
[Dolmabalçe Palace] - Personal favourite for single building
Designed for The Empire and become new heart of the city
[Old Istanbul] - I love visiting these areas in Istanbul because they are full of history and lives
Different people like Turks, Greeks, Armenians, French, English and many more people lived in these areas with their mark standing still to date
These people created a culture which can’t be seen in today’s life but if you look for it, you will find these people in the city
Taxi drivers hands down
Police officers, sure
I am not sure if it is hate but there is a huge distrust towards the judges and prosecutors
> This system isn't exactly popular
Irrelevant, but why
I always thought this church*-tax* is fucking brilliant and we should have it in Turkey too
Yeah all of them make sense, although I still prefer this system over our system, which mosques and other religious related costs are directly funded from the budget
The only thing I wouldn't accept is that your employer knows your affiliation
It can arrangeable, though
I thought the government keeps some of those tax money for the administration cost
If not, then it makes sense
> I'm honestly surprised the Turkish state is funding their mosques directly considering its secular nature
Actually the idea was to control all the mosques and prevent any kind of radicalism by making them civil servant
It surely worked to some extent, but it also had so many adverse affects, which is kind of irrelevant to this topic
Anyways, now we have a government that uses mosques as its political propaganda tool, so it kind of backfired for the moment
In short, I'm just pissed that my tax-money is being spent on some mosques
Well Turkey allows double citizenship but I am going to express something else
There mustn't be allowance for dual citizenship for Turks IMO
The diaspora is abusing their rights, thus they come to Turkey once a year and they think it's all sunshine and rainbows
They are completely silent when we ask why they pay 6K euros for military service if they love their country so much or why they won't return to Turkey
They have no idea of life in Turkey, they are delusional and they must be expelled
&#x200B;
*nawww diaspora turks are upset I see*
I like seeing all countries ridiculed, including my own
Insults are not nice though, for any country
Why not
Not saying they're funny but why particularly Greece
I'm aware
It probably extends to Caucasus, Iran and maybe Levant too, considering my central Anatolian mother also does it
Fun fact: The female version of monster is monstress
Hej, tack så mycket
I opened this account 8 years ago
I was very interested in Swedish culture as some interested in Japanese (Started with Swedish metal music)
Went to Stockholm 2 times, and liked the city a lot, learned the language to some extent, followed news, youtube channels in Swedish etc, but in years intensity of my passion kind of fade away
At some point I thought about finding a job there
But It takes a great effort to find a job in EU from non-EU countries
So it's still kind of dilemma for me
About the weather, I went to Stockholm in February and August
In August it was pretty good
26 degrees is perfect for Summer
In February it was around -8 but humidity made it more comfortable
Language transfer is great
I am listening their Greek classes and it's pretty good
Yes I actually discovered their Turkish course first when I was bored and decided to see how do people learn Turkish lol
I listened just the first few and liked it quite a bit
I can't make comments about the quality of the course with just a few podcast but their technique is very effective especially for languages with little to none relation like Turkish and Greek (or most European languages
Turkish is quite different)
And thanks for the warning
I'll keep this in mind
His Turkish pronunciations are also not great especially vowels and the "L" letter but I guess it's easier to learn for a foreigner with some accent
Promises made by Political Parties
If they promised something during the elections and after being the government, There should be a different department from government to check if they manage to do their plans
If they don’t, there should be repeat elections and banning that party to be in government
If they lied to gain votes, reelection
etc
Sounds of prayer call from mosques
They are irritating and disrespectful
I don't know if you guys have the same problem with church bells
Horn, siren and alarm sounds on the radio
Cigarettes and (maybe) alcohol
What is the hate against alcohol after banning cigarettes
Does alcohol consumption change behaviours in society
Cigarettes,alcohol,adultery
A part of me was cut and taken from me when I was 2 and couldn't defend myself
Law isn't supposed work like this
Our religion order circumcision to us
There isn't a singular objective reality
Everyone has their own version of reality
This makes truth subjective
Which means truth is defined by those with power
And criminalizing lying would be the first step towards a totalitarian society where everyone abides by the state's truth or is punished
I propose another solution: people can stop being absolute gullible retards and don't believe in everything they read instead
Massive cost
What about all the people employed thanks to the existence of cigarettes
I'm not defending cigarettes, but the world isn't black and white
Also if cigarettes enter the illegal drug category, there will be a rise in crime, smuggling, and black market production, and rise of costs on war against drugs
Incarceration of cigarette smokers and producers will be even more costly as jails start to fill up
Like I said it's not black and white
Amen to this
Can you give me an example
What has society been changing due to alcohol consumption in Sweden
It is hard for me to observe the changes in a country where alcohol consumption is lower than average in Europe
If you are muslim,you have to be circumcised
Is Julian Assange a traitor
Let's say that's what the government brands him as
And you came up and said he isn't. You will be prosecuted for not following the ruling party's narrative
What about God
How is it going to work in a country with blasphemy laws
Life isn't 2+2=4
Everyone perceives life through their filters and creates their own reality
This is how human mind works
One might say the sky is purple and the other says the sky is green and they both would be right in their own worlds
Life isn't black and white
One day you are a terrorist the other day you are freedom fighter
One day you are fighting for democracy and freedom the other day you fight for oil
One day you are fighting Eastasia and the other day you are fighting Eurasia, if you know what I mean
In a complex world like this, creating and protecting one absolute and objective truth, one way to look at things, one way to interpret the world is not possible
What you say can work in a system similar to China or North Korea but it can in no way work in a multi-party democracy
Voters need to take some responsibility for their actions instead of blaming everything on some nebulous "system". There will always be bad people, we can only limit them to some extent
Taking it too far is how you get a dystopia
If people are stupid enough, criminalizing lying would solve nothing
There are other forms of manipulation as well
There are a lot of different shades between a lie and a truth
And not everyone lies out of malice
Like I said people create their own worlds and their own realities
I mean it's not some distant past when some people on Earth thought Aryan race is superior to others
Believe me, if "lying" was criminalized during the feudal times, we couldn't have advanced this far
I once paid something like 0
75 CHF  for a beer to a German guy who brought a 24 case at a bbq party
He gave me the price after I asked for one
After 4 years, I'm still processing it
No articles
In these covid days, i am trying to learn german
After one year, i started to feel the article tbh
I wish i had "feelings" about speaking also
Yeah we have a lot of Indian series on certain channels
They are really bad lol
“Çomar”s they are old fashioned people, they don’t question, trust without any condition in politics(like you did something good for them, they will turn their asses for you to fuck”, they usually vote for Erdogan, doesn’t like progress, likes licking asses of people, if it is islam related, it is true then, they like to follow fake news and happy with their minimum wage which right about under 400€ like they can spend 100€ per month and save 300€ while poverty line of Turkey is 1100€ and starvation line is around 350€. I am amused that how they can survive with this excellent intelligent in Turkey’s wildlife and their life style should be documentary voice by National Geographic guy that makes voice over on animal documentaries
I don’t know if it is a streotype type but Turkish elders are really funguys when they are not talking
Their actions are funny and watchable
The thing I hate is we are portrayed in movies as if we live in a desert and all the woman living here wear burqa or hijab
No, we are not an islam state, Turkish Republic has no official religion although (my guess) %70 of the people are muslims
We turks have same laziness (i heard it from a person went to greece) but nobody talks about it
Also you may heard that, there is a racist stereotype in Turkey "Greeks love swimming" this is about greece losing and getting back to aegean isles in the Turkish Inpendenece War (1920-1922)
This is mostly used by kids tbh :P.
Jeez dude calm down
You made me laugh, thank you kind stranger
Happy cake day
Silent, but talk way too much
This is a good situation to say "bruh" very loudly
At least we had a little democracy back then
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk
It will probably take hours to explain what he did for us and my english is not that good when it comes to politics
You can just research it
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk for most people, as the founder of the secular republic
Those who are too conservative would probably disagree, though
But who cares, really
Battle of Gallipoli
Only once
When Mehmet II conquered Constantinople, he entitled himself as "Kaiser-i Rûm (Cesar of Rome)". Also he setted up an Italian campaign to conquer Rome but he lived only enough to see the capture of Otranto Castle
Anatolian Seljuks was called  Sultanate of Rûm but it was because they were formed at old Roman lands
It was more like geographical rather than political
Sorry if my grammar is bad
Just Ottoman Empire
As far as I know, only the Greek patriarchy in Istanbul recognized that claim
And I'm not sure about the chronology, but the Russian Empire made the same claim too
Does anybody know if anyone else recognized Mehmet II as the Ceasar of Rome back then
I see you are a man of culture as well
Taxis which some try to take the long route if he does you can call the police to give him a big fine
(Use Bitaksi App to call one like Uber)
Kebab Restaurant where serves rice next to a kebab(read the menu before ordering it because people who own that place should not be earning any money and send to the deepest place in hell as well as on the planet)
Don’t shop in Every Souvenir Store (Don’t but anything in first souvenir store you see because you might end up getting Chinese ones which there are at same price as local shops with nice hand carving or handmades)
Taxis especially for tourists
Yes,only thinks that should come with a kebab is a bread and some greens
It solely based on memorization and we almost never get to learn the logic behind the stuff we learn, which really sucks as we therefore can't project it into reality ublike in other systems like IB,IGSCE etc
And religion is completely useless as the people that want to learn it already do as their parents generally push it to them while those who don't care at all just sit there often trying to get some sleep as no one really cares or listens to the class
Forced to memorise to pass, Skills other than math is taught as unimportant, Richer you are the better education you get, Under qualified teachers, Every lesson is taught random stuff which doesn’t make it to big picture, If you don’t study, education system will kill you basically
i was gonna write exact same thing for Turkey
I was in Spain last year, although i loved the country there is a lot to criticise in many aspects such as education, politics etc like Turkey
Probably haggis
I didn't expect it to taste well at all
"Greek"...
Tzatziki = Cacik
It is a Turkish dish, not Greek
The word tzatziki is just their way of spelling the word Cacik
All of them okay in here
british occupation flag
when we fight against 5 countries (Turkish İndepence War) UK control İstanbul
UK want do puppet country after Turkish İndepence War
this flag not created by turks but its historical and everybody hate this
mesela
i love both cyprus flag love from turkey <3
whats first cyprus flag
can you send link
thats interesting i live in turkey and i live in bosnian town
mostly they have bars and they hang yugoslavia flags around bar

Osmanlı selçuklu göktürk aç abi sıkıntı yok bizim ülkede

i saw this i suppose first flag has big differences between present flag . i didnt know thats first flag
i think its nice
The reason why I know how to pronounce this “muvaffakiyetsizleştiricileştiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmişsinizcesine” - meaning "As though you are from those whom we may not easily be able to make into a maker of unsuccessful ones
" or I just say the question that they asked in Turkish
Greece
We need to educate our people ngl
And both sides need to start compromising
Uhmm where should I start
To fix things, we have to elect AKP out first
Then the rest will follow I hope
Though I don’t think the problems in East would be solved so easily
We don’t really hate you per se but Turkish people in Bulgaria have suffered so much, so I guess that raises a negativity
And I’ve always got the feeling that you’re not very fond of us
Backgammon / Turkey
We also have [Okey
] Maybe considerable for second national game
We have same game called “kızma bilader” means “don’t be upset brother” in Turkey
Fun fact, Okey is invented when card games were banned in coffee shops
It's practically a card game with tiles
our capital city probably
since not very touristic (internationally)
it ranks the 2nd by population

Sincap(From Persian): An animal comes from Squirrel Family Tree, lives on trees, usually eats fruit, has too many hair, long tail, has tiny body, Değin(II), Çekelez(Sciurus Vulgaris)
Pronunciation: Sin-job, words in english is the closes you can get as pronunciation in Turkish
Squirrel
That pretty specific but aight, it's "Sincap".
Sincap
Sin=Same pronounciation in english
Cap= can be pronounced like “job” but a little tougher
Its pretty easy for non-natives to pronounce
We should stop looking like cool guy which doesn’t(edit: i meant doesn’t but wrote does) speaks much kind of foreign policy
This hurts Turkey the most where you can let anyone to talk about you and don’t saying anything which is easy for to be accused doing something way out of the line
And we need a new government
Armenian genocide and supporting Palestine instead of Isreal
Yes, yes we do
And I have never met someone who doesn't.
Recep Tayip Erdoğan its sadly 50/50 hopefully in 5 years that will change
menemen (a traditional dish in turkey) is better with/without onions
Soccer if you are from opposite team you are dead specially if there is a Derby
People hate each other because of that
I was a nice name change I think
A lot of people changed quite fast, and even in Turkey, I hear and read comments that either use Çekya(Czechia) or use Çek Cumhuriyeti(Czech Rebuplic) first and correct themselves to Çekya
I guess people didn't really liked the old name
And everyone hates each other because of football (türküm)
If you are interested, I believe most songs of Duman are popular in karaoke here
[Duman - Bu Akşam]
[Duman - Senden Daha Güzel]
[Duman - Her Şeyi Yak]
Affiliated with Arabs in every expect
Only thing that we have common with Arabs is the religion which we still have huge difference in that
Whenever I see Turkey is in a film, they show it like any other desert city in Arab World
There are camels(we don’t have camel as usual but in couple touristic places), women fully closed in black(majority of women in Turkey doesn’t use any type of hijab while fully covered in Black like ninja exist within Arabs in Turkey), men dressed up in white (only imams or some religious people wear those which is very rare), they shot scenes in areas where drought happens every summer to show it like a muslim country that you would expect, Police cars from 1970’s but actually there is not much difference from any European Country and the most importantly any information most likely to be not true or true but not accurate
No, We are not one of the state of Arabia and not every woman wear headscarf or obligated to wear headscarf in here
Okay, Turkey are a Muslim country but it doesnt means we ride camels and speak arabic
Tbh we dont ride camels
There is NO camels except the camels at zoo
And we dont speak arabic
There is still so many neo-ottomanist (nationalist) people but yea Turkey is a modern country, i think
We do not ride camels to get somewhere and not everyone in Turkey wears hijab or burqa
Another thing is, get ready, Istanbul is not the capital of Turkey
Hans bring out ze Flamenwerfer

Yes, I can since I was 2 years old and 2 Wheel since I was 4 years old but I haven’t ridden for 5 years
I would really like to see a game about the Spanish Civil War

Also Rumeli (Roman Land) for all of Balkans

they are arabs
we fuck donkeys
Is it bad meaning other than related to Mongols
If not, then it is historically true statement which we are related
"It started in 1939 and ended in 1945
Germany - Italy - Japan fought against USSR - Britain - USA
Germany lost
The war ended when USA bombed Hiroshima & Nagasaki in Japan with 2 atomic bombs
That's it, this is more or less the only paragraph about WW2 in history books in my whole high school life
We just sat and watched
im in high school and i still havent been taught a thing about ww2 so far
This is good to know
When I was in high school, the history teachers pretended like nothing ever happened after Atatürk died in 1938
No WW2, no Cold War, no crisis, no coups, nothing
We were neutral throughout the war (if we exclude last moments of war when we declared war on Germany), thus it didn't affect us who killed who
In school they emphasize a looot more on WW1 and Turkish war of independence btw
Well
(winks in ottoman)
Everytime of ottomans
The Ottoman Empire and Old Middle Asian Turks
Probably Kırıkkale
It's a province that neighbors Ankara and It's sole purpose is to keep Ankara's air clean by building all the factories there
And the funny thing is, the word Kırıkkale means "Broken Castle". And even It's mayor said It's a "meh" city
Here's a depressing [photo] of it
I am from Izmir
People tend to call my way of talk "uneducated and lazy" and "not-cute".
Normally I can speak closer to standard turkish if I am surrounded by non-izmirians, but once I get started to speak with my family and friends from hometown, shit gets real
To be honest, speaking standard Turkish is tiring
Well, noone speaks standard Turkish anyway
Isn't the capital city supposed to have the standard accent
Why is that the case in Sweden
sende (on you) ≠ sen de (you too)
onlarınki (the thing that's theirs) ≠ onların ki (it's theirs, though)
kârımı paylaşıyorum (I'm sharing my income) ≠ karımı paylaşıyorum (I voted for DSP)
The architecture was pretty cool, I don't think Turkey has anything to compare to Brooklyn Bridge, at least in terms of *modern* architecture
Been up in Empire State as well, amazing view
The amount of homeless people, trash on the streets along with the quality of the subway was pretty fucking depressing though
The city could use a lot of investment into utilities
Hahahaha
It was "crazy thief" here
Hahaha is there any anti-russian sentiment there
how did you even get into those situations, OP
> When I was around 10, an adult man groped my butt while we were in a crowded bus
> When I was around 11, boys in my class used to touch the girl's butt and private area and run away
> A one night stand penetrated me without a condom when I had said "no" multiple times beforehand
wow
im so sorry
did these events traumatize you
> 28 year old
thats old
Ironically the Turkish in Germany are whining about "gurbet", telling us how hard it is live abroad and how they love Erdoğan
I watched a video about Turkish immigrants who are living in the UK and supporting Brexit
I was utterly amazed at their way of thinking, it was the stupidest thing
Also I used to have a Polish pen-pal type of thing for a little while 6-7 years ago and she was also talking about the conservatives in your country
It sounded insane, even for middle schooler(?) me
They are literally everywhere here
Apparently been around since at least 1938 too
Barış Özcan
He is a TedX talker and makes videos about everything
From Books he recommends to who Stephen Hawking was
And some of his videos have English subtitles so everyone can check him out
140journos, kind of a documentary news type of channel, This is the best one for me
Barış Özcan, kind of a scientific channel, more like giving informations about things that you might never thought of - i watch him time to time
Doğa İçin Çal, Translation is “Play For The Nature”, Every year they release a song which mostly old folk song(s) which around 60 people sings it, even celebrities joins too, to gain more recognition for nature in public - recommended for Greeks too since there are couple songs which we share
tvMisha, I like her energy into the videos, I can see myself, when sometimes helps me to watch something joyful
Enes Batur gang rise up
Ünsal Ünlü. He's one of the very few news commentators left who can openly criticise the government today
It is more something to do when you are first introduced and in formal settings (if you are going to some other company for business for example, you would shake hands)
In informal settings (between friends and family) it generally evolves to cheek kisses
Myself
Cats I guess, I am more of a reptilian guy
My Country
Fucking cats everywhere, especially in Istanbul
Continent
In Europe, I believe cats are slightly more popular
Asia is too big to speak generally, region-wise Western, Central and northern asia cats are more popular while in southern and eastern Asia dogs are more popular
Personal: Cats
National: Definetely dogs
Cats are everywhere in western Turkey and people get along with them well though
Continental: I have no idea
Turkey is like the non-official cat country of the internet
I’m a cat person as well but dogs are nice too
I am a cat person,Turkey is very well knows with all animals really, but specifically with cats
Plus cats have a special spot within Islam so people hold them dearly
But overall, I'd say Europe is a dog continent, and Asia is a cat continent
Transcontinental gang lez goo
Turkey has quite a few languages despite the latest homogenisation of the culture
Laz language, offshoot of old Greek still spoken in the Black Sea region
The famous whistling language, which doesn't have words but melodies, is whistled in the mountains of Black Sea
There is the Zaza language, which is another Kurdish dialect distinct from Gourmanji (widely known as the Kurdish)
Other languages which are spoken as native languages by minorities in Turkey are Azeri, Turkoman, Karapapak, Bosniak, Bulgarian, Greek, Aramean, Arab, Circassian, Georgian and Abkhazian
ASML is well-known to Turkish engineers
The fez is banned but nobody wears it seriously anyway so it's not enforced
At this point it's just a costume
>Making fun of the German president (not chancellor) is being punished
If enforced, a law like this is one of the best tools to be abused by a tyrant
It's a ticking timebomb I can guarantee you that
We also had that law
We didn't notice it either and look where that lead us
Criticism is abstract in nature, any criticism of the government can be twisted and bent into "insulting the president".
If we can count Istanbul, definitely Istanbul
If not, Athens
1-Istanbul (One of the most important cities in the world, not just Balkans)
2-Athens (Base of the Western culture)
3-Sarajevo (Jerusalem of the Europe)
Well, half(actually more like 60%) of it is in Thrace
Which is Balkan
Well, most of the financial centers and the population is on the European part
But then, the Asian part is also pretty important
In any case, even if you count the European part only it'd be the most populous Balkan city
Pretty solid evidence for both the pre-Turkic history and Turkic history of Anatolia
Every now and then people find fragments of ancient statues or temples, not even counting the structures that remain standing
Many people view history biased
For example, we are not Mongols and we are not Arabs too
Often such a result is due to distorted expressions
Even if we look at the thousand years that passed with our arrival in Anatolia, we have a dense history
There is already before
Credit Cards with NFC, Cash(only applies for minibuses), -insert city name- Card or Tickets
But Government is now changing to one card system for every city and transportation
We have a card you can put money in, you also can download the app and pay with your phone or you can use your credit card to pay but no one does that
Same, except we do it only when we board
There are also chip readers in train and metrobus stations that you hold your card against, it automatically calculates the amount of money to be repaid when you exit the bus/train
we say the first food cones to mind ends with an "i"
peynir=cheese
sosis=sausage
piliç=chicken
Ask whatever you want but dont ask camels
We dont use them here
Erdoğan is getting weaker, i hope he wont be our president in a few years
The tallest person on earth and the person with the biggest nose are turkish and live in Turkey
Also technically money was invented in Turkey by Lydinans
Also also Turkey is the country with the highest consumption of tea
I think it was around 631 days or something like that
I saw a video about it today lol
>kebab shops are in turmoil, doners are woefully incomplete
The fuck kinda döner do you people eat
Turkey would be in shambles
You can’t have Döner, Kebap of İskender without potatoes
Apparently some people even put yogurt in döner
Now that's just gross
Imma throw up
Just no yogurt, please
Basketball is pretty crazy here when it's with fans
We have had all kinds of violence in basketball
We would be the uncle that starts up shit with absolutely everyone on the dinner table for no reason that everyone reacts awkwardly to the presence of
We would also talk about how everything used to be better back in the day
Probably sit with Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and definitely cook with them
Enjoy the food, get drunk and try to kill each other while arguing which Empire was the best
Argue with Greece about who invented the food, then tell them that their version of it tastes like shit anyway
Can we cook
Balkans are a cursed place
That’s a second ideal table
Wars with Muslim states while Turks were Tengrist
Also Romans
It is exactly opposite in Turkey
We were taught very well about WW1
On the other hand WW2  was just a few paragraphs on books unless you take an advanced history class
Probably, It is because of we did not take part in
I have learnt nearly everything on my own
I just want to ask
Did you guys get taught about the battle of Gallipoli
Or they just skipped it
it seems awesome, kinda peace/anti war propaganda
We always talk about wars which were mostly won, tactics, commanders, sultans
We talk about  how our ancestors were great soldier and how they ruled the world
We do not talk about a lot about people and their sufferings
I think,The Republic Era and WW1 are in the context  you mentioned
At a minimal level, so it's not a tradition
The tradition is to make sure that mothers are over-protective and children are not given a chance to develop their personality as individuals
i think what makes this sub at least functional for a Turk like myself is the low subcount
which makes it less toxic compared to r/europe
Aged 21 and I don't remember I have gone once
The doctor thing kinda scary
Some people don't even know what is the Seljuk Empire
Literally everything can i say
Because they even taught us the second political parties' ideologies, I personally would be surprised if they taught anybody abroad
We must read your book about how to forge a country
The Country Of White Lilies
Dude we were your archnemesis
We learn some stuff about your country
We learn about you in history and religion class
The book was made mandatory by Atatürk in the 1930s. It isn't mandatory now but still, some schools make us read it
It is a quick read
It tells us how a nation succeeds
It tells how Finland wasn't autonomus while it was in Sweden
And then the Russians conquered it and gave it autonomy
It tells about some of the reforms in education and bureocracy
I recommend it to you
You can finish it on a long bus ride
How friendly do you consider your country for non-EU expats/immigrants ?
Do expats/immigrants have a hard time making things work out for them or integrating to the culture of your country ? How do natives view non-Eu immigrants ?
For me idk
One of my friends said that she would never tell where she is from just in case
She has blond hair and fair complexion so people don't usually think that she is turk right away
One of my other friends said that he would always be sure to be well-groomed
But my brother who stayed in Gröningen for a bit said that he didn't encounter anything bad
Is it because of prejudice or culture when it comes to Africans or people from the middle East ? Do you think someone from these countries who is completely integrated with the German culture and has the same mindset ,shares the same values  will be treated same as let's say a Japanese immigrant ?
I think expat means someone who works in a foreign country but doesn't plan on staying there on the long term whereas immigrants are permanent residents .
Damn I got triggered reading this , I don't want to be associated with any of that especially the BMW disco music part lol .
No idea tbh
I know and the wierd thing is Turks from Turkey don't like Turks in Germany either bc of these stereotypes and their behaviours
Not all of us have pizza cutter, so we use knifes
But scissors
Doesn't feel right
Justinian 1: Eastern Roman Empire was very big under his reign
Constantine XI: Was a good rival
One of the few, not evil Emporer
So I'd say that's a good choice
Black sea region, or eastern Turkey in general,really
Adana, south eastern turkey, mostly populated by immigrants
Its Florida of turkey basically
İstanbul: Let's take the city of the world's desire, run it somewhat alright for a few centuries, then completely fuck it up with immigration, unplanned growth and chaos after the 60s. 17 million people with some who have never seen the sea even though the city is surrounded by sea on al sides
Still has some of the most beautiful areas though
And I have been to many, many cities around the world
Ankara: Let's take a small town that is somewhat strategically safe during the Liberation War and make it the capital and completely fuck it up with unplanned growth and immigration
But has a very modest population, all of whom work for the government in one way or another
Nobody loves the city but I do
İzmir: Let's take a Greek town and leave it alone for centuries and then completely fuck it up with unplanned growth and immigration after the 60s. But let's also fill it with lots of beautiful girls and good people
They're too proud of themselves for my taste but it's a good place overall
2 hour drive to any wonderful holiday spot
>  involuntary treatment,
It might be true, but I'm sure that there are some laws that protect the kid's healthy
What happens if a kid gets cancer and the parents don't want the treatment
It's a genuine question btw, not rhetorical
Carl Gustav XII is Demirbaş Şarl (Ironhead Sharl)
and Charles the Fifth translates to “Şarlken” Don’t know why
If it counts, the stereotype about Jewish people with money has never been my experience at all
Including the tourists from Israel
I worked at a 5-star hotel for nearly 2 years and have close friends who still do
We haven't noticed any difference at all with most other groups I can think
We *could* name at least three groups of people who are offensively cheap with money, they are not one of them
Ooh I can't give names but let's just say it's not a nation in Europe, America, or Australia
their understanding of tips is limited to coins
They can spend $2,000 on their dinner, have extra requests from the staff, but will tip like 10 pennies
And they even give that in rude "take this generosity and leave, peasant" ways
Their political state is also "generous to themselves/to their own wealthy, super cheap with helping others
don’t go eastern cities where the kurds are majority and in west turkey just avoid where the kurds, gypsies and romans live, just a couple of neighbourhoods
What are some good rock/metal songs from your country for my playlist ?
Hi, recently I am making a playlist from rock/metal music from different countries
I made up some rules for my playlist
\- The song has to be in the native language (in one of them if there are more than one)
\- There need to be one song from each country
\- It would be great if the song involve a national instrument (optional)
\- It would be great if the song have some distinctive elements about the country (optional)
Thank you
i think it's [Baris Manco - Donence]
but especially with local insturments: [Cem Karaca & Mogollar - Obur Dunya]
&#x200B;
for Turkey
Model - Buzdan Şato
You definitely should check it out
The group is no longer active but the song never gets old :)
>Villagers of Ioannina City
Definitely got my attention
Thank you
That's a lot of song to listen :)
The song is pretty good
It took the place for Hungary for now
>Viikate - Pohjoista Viljaa
This filled the place for Finland for now unless something better will come
It is pretty great
>It’s quite ”light” metal though, takes influences from Finnish shlager
No problem at all
I added metal to the question just to add verity
I think I will go with Iron Maiden for UK
Since I know a lot more music from us
This is the hardest decision :)
And that helped a lot with Bulgaria
Thank you
Italy's place currently filled with your [2021 Eurovision participant] :)
It will stay until something better will come
>punk rock band than a metal band
This is fine
I don't look for metal groups specifically
I look for hard rock/heavy metal genres
You suggestion is also good
I like punk rock
"Ies" got into the list
I really liked the band as well
But Romania will be hard since I heard some great rock songs from Romania before
The HU is already in the list
Amazing, added to the list
>I wouldn't say that they qualify as a rock band
The band don't have to be Rock band
The song should be, also "Zitti e buoni" is currently in the list for Italy, but it can change
Thanks for the suggestions I will check them
>Also in case you are eventually missing any countries, there are some
>incredible lists
> over at
>r/IndigenousMetal
> that might help you
This helped a lot thank you
>I see the others suggested you VIC for Greece
I think it fits very nicely to your criteria, they are awesome
I chose the band for my list the real question is which song
It really is great
> Also in case you are eventually missing any countries, there are some [incredible lists] over at [r/IndigenousMetal] that might help you
Also thank you for the suggestion I will check it out
I know :)
Turkey would be a lot harder than other countries since I know a lot more songs
>Extremoduro
Song in this link is in the list for Spain for now
It is pretty great
Thank you
The song is actually pretty great
But yeah it conflicts with native language rule
lol i did not notice your flair
anyways, wish you great day
>Falconer - Vid rosornas grav
I know this song and loved it but forgot its name
Yeah this will be the one for Sweden
Thanks
Aa Türk müydün hiç dikkat etmemiştim hahaha :))
My initial plan is to put one per country it would be really crowded anyways because it won't be limited with Europe, but there will be a lot of replacements when I found better song from a country
So I am always open for suggestions :)
Erdoğan and his beloved Abdülhamit
Kenan Evren, the commander-in-chief during the coup of 1980 was probably the worst
An 17 year-old leftist kid (Erdal Eren) was sentenced to death although the decision was overruled by the supreme court twice
His age was ruled to be one year older by the court to make the execution possible
Evren's comment was sarcastic:
"Should we feed them (for the rest of their lives) instead of hanging them
He was also sarcastic about the 1961 constitution since he found it "too democratic". He said:
"That constitution was too loose for us
We'd started to play in it".
On freedom of speech:
"We don't tell our intellectuals to stop thinking
It's just enough if they don't tell their thoughts to others".
Erdoğan ( still president) won 3 elections
Most of my people are dumb
Kösem Sultan, a female regent who tried to have the ruler murdered
> atrocities
you mean genocide
In that terms, Armenian Genocide wasn't a genocide either since most of Armenian wasn't even re-located specially the ones were at western side of Anatolia
When did I deny anything Turkey has ever done
I'm sick of hypocrisy of other countries
If some another country has done similar things it is atrocities
if Turkey has done, it is genocide
fuck this shit
The hypocrisy part is negligible of the incident
Noone bites an eye about what Belgium had done in there but when it comes to Turks, everyone goes nuts
Btw, you are the first person who said Ottomans not Turks about genocide
Turkish:
Teşekkürler - exact translation: thanks
Teşekkür ederim- e.t.: I thank
Çok teşekkürler- e.t. Many/very thanks
Sağol- e.t. Be alive/live (a very delicate way to thank someone, not so formal tho
Sağolasın- May you be alive (another delicate way, with more gratitude)
Sayende- Under your shadow/with your shadow/thanks to your shadow (this is arguably the most delicate way to thank someone for their effort and help
Saye comes to Turkish from Persian, meaning shadow
Their shadow represents the indirect effects their efforts might have on a persons actions/wishes)
Teşekkür ederim: singular
Teşekkür ederiz: plural
Ministry of Education gives a 100 book recommendations list each year with small changes
60  book from Turkish literature, 30 from foreign literature, 10 others and theaters
Students, teachers or they together choose which books they will read
"Autobahn" or as it is in Turkish "Otoban"
We have some
Kuruş, bitter, vasistas, şnorkel, şalter, zeplin, general, dikta, dekan, element, genetik, otoban, revir
These are some of the German words in the Turkish language
There are more if you're interested
I had long hair for 10+ years
Never heard a negative comment about it
Except playful comments from immediate family
It was big no-no in high school though
Every monday they would check us for hair and beard length
If it's just beard you could shave in the bathroom but if it was hair, they wouldn't let you in
I had to jump through the school wall to get in, for the last month of high school
My hair was very long until August and every male i know (except my dad) was ok with it
Girls was jelous tho
lmao
peygamberdevesi
it means "prophet's camel"
weird
"Peygamberdevesi". Which means "Prophet's camel".
It's made of two words "Peygamber" (prophet, Persian) and "Deve" (camel, Turkish)
"Peygamberdevesi" roughly translates to THE PROPHET CAMEL
Peygamber devesi
Which translates to “camel of the prophet”. Why
I don’t know :(
[Tarkan - Şımarık] (also known as Kiss Kiss but literal translation is Sassy) might be the most popular song internationally
You have probably heard of [kuzu kuzu by tarkan ] but these days its [patlamaya devam by isyan tetick]
It seems like we tried to balance our relations with Nazi Germany by being nice but not so nice
We were kind of neutral to them through most of the war
Germany wanted us to enter the war on their side and even promised us land but fortunately we refused it
Not in Europe but I have visited Alanya Kalesi, it's in Antalya

The war of independence, the declaration of the republic, abolishment of the khalifate and the sultanate, and the reforms after that
Turkish war of independence, resulting to the formation of the secular republic and start of the reformation era led by one of the most influental person of the 20th century, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk
That's a pretty interesting protest, i was really amazed when i first heard about the singing revolution
Sick
We have war if independence too
yeah, but when the ottomans collapsed literally everyone decided to invade anatolia, and we kicked them out in the war of independence, abolished the sultanate, and declared a republic
Empire lost at WW1
Sultan gave country to British, Italian, French, Greek, Armenian
Most succesful soldier of the WW1, Mustafa Kemal started a war of independance in 1919
He fought against all that countries and abolished Sultanate in 1922
He declared the republic in 1923
We are a country that smaller than 100, but we had a major change after war of independence
But I would answer as the reforms after the war not the war itself
Well, in theory, we are still secular
But in act, we are not even secular as much as theocratic UK since 1981
Or greece who just adopted secularism
In fact, we are among the most religiously/conservatively governed secular countries
Anti-secularization policies were started back in 1950s, but thankfully, they weren't able to make much progress since they were acting against Ataturk's reforms and they dragged Turkey into an enormous economic crisis that effected 70% of the population, which led to a coup taking over in 1960
Nearly all of the anti-secularization progress were made after the 1981 coup
That coup was backed by the USA's McCarthyist government and intelligence agencies
After that, Turkey started turning into a pro-conservative politically corrupt country
Which led to the today's Erdogan era
From Ottoman Empire actually
There were two different ruling points after WW1
One as a rebel government in Ankara ruled by Atatürk, one in İstanbul ruled by the Sultan
The war was actually against the countries involved in [the treaty of Serves]
Treaty of Sevres was way worse than Treaty of Versailles
Also British, Italian and French were there o colonize those lands
You’re like the anti-Greek
Next you’ll tell me you don’t like to take on debt
Same, a family of 4 in turkey consumes at least 6 breads  a day
It's a Balkan thing
Zeugma museum(Gaziantep City), Istanbul aviation museum, Topkapı palace, Maiden's tower, Beylerbeyi palace, war museum, pera museum, mısır apartmentz papadoulos apartment, few more apartments, modern art gallery, archeology museum, islam technology and science museum, sea museum, Yerebatan cistern, whole Üsküdar, Fatih, Beyoğlu, Karaköy districts, camondo stairs and a lot more
Damn I love Istanbul
>archeology museum
Can confirm
I like archaeology - only in an amateur sense - and 2 years ago I went to the Istanbul archaeology museum for my birthday
I spent 6 hours there and would have probably stayed much longer if I didn't have other plans
(I went back of course
) It's my personal favorite tied with the Anatolian Civilizations Museum in Ankara
Some others to mention: Istanbul toy museum, Koç Museum, Naval Museum in Beşiktaş, Archaeological museum in Antalya, Çorum Museum (for Hittite history)
Oh yes, I forgot to type about those
Thanks
I am guessing Greece and Turkey’s answer would Cyprus if we don’t consider water as a border
Other than it would be Italy for Turkey
I would say its actually the best city or the second best, has all the advantages of İstanbul, but also has the advantages of having about 1/3 of istanbuls population
and also has a proper mayor now
In our capital people don’t know how to drive, outside of our capital people know how to drive
ankara: kickass mayor
rest of the cities: utter shite mayors
it is
or rather it was until recently since it got rigged
It is and almost everyone buys it
No one thinks that they would win, but everyone still keeps buying it
In Turkey, replace every "Christmas" with "New Year" and that's it
So yeah
We have a New Year Lottery
In Turkey, it is also New Year's Eve
Well, we don't celebrate Christmas anyways
Eastern(most) region or Western (most) region for entirely different reasons
East: There are lots of Kurdish citizens living there and already have some seperatist movements
(The topic is really contravertial and I don't feel knowledgeble enough)
West: Much less likely to secede
There is an obvious West-Rest division on political views
Western part is a lot more secular and richer than rest of the country
do i really need to answer
south-eastern Kurdish separatism is already a thing,
there are some eastern Anatolian Armenian speaking "pockets"
there are also laz people but to my knowledge, they never tried to secede from neither turkey nor ottomans
While I don't think its likely for the Southeast to secede, it is the only region that has some kind of reason to
For those who don't know Turkish geography, that means regions where Kurds are the majority or a very large minority
[This] map may help you understand
It is Turkish but its mainly numbers so you can understand
Red is Erdoğan, Blue is secular votes, Purple is Kurdish votes with a bit
exaggeration
But the previous map changed after the last [local elections] But I prefer general elections as indicator
People don't vote to mayors as they vote to government
In this new map brown is ally of Erdoğan, red is secular, purple is Kurdish, orange is Erdoğan
Look at the other map on my other reply to u/young_chaos
İstanbul voted secular on latest election on 2019
Even tough it was local elections it still had really big impact on Turkish politics
In fact government didn't accept the results and remade the elections just in İstanbul just to be defeated with a bigger margin
İstanbul is just Pygmy Turkey
I think we share this sentiment with most Balkan countries: stray dogs are not seen as problems
They are well taken care of and are our friends
Cats are everywhere in Turkey but no one sees them as stray
It's more like they are where they belong
They own this country, their homeland
Touristic places have big populations of stray dogs, usually pedigree, due to people going on holidays with a new puppy and leaving it there
our streets are full of stray animals but we don't see it as a problem
They are not strays, they are community *members* that we like to take care of
Massive fucking problem, every other day on the news there is someone who got mauled by the packs of dogs
Worse, "animal rights activists" get up and raise hell whenever someone suggests fixing the problem
The cats are fine though
We love our cats
In Turkey, we want and feed them all
Cats and dogs are live happily
You cans watch on Google and YouTube
There is a short film about it called 'Kedi' or 'the cat'
it's a colossal problem here in turkey
and the people exacerbate it
those so called "animal lovers" are actually very cruel people
they leave food on the street and prevent the animal control (municipalities) do their job
why
for a quick instagram photo or just for a quick pet
if you love animals so much, get one indoors at your home
don't just leave bit of leftovers just for easing your mind
what happens in reality: cats and dogs eat garbage and breed
more misery is spread
no developed nation has this stray problem
In Turkey, there are stray packs almost everywhere
They're fed so they are hardly aggressive
[they are a problem if you are old or a child]
In Turkey we don't call free cats "strays". They happily live where they have always lived and are usually taken care of by people
but stray dogs are kind of a problem but cats are lovely
In every street you will see atleast two stray cats
Stray dogs are not a problem as well
They are since there are so many of them they are very hungry and they attack everything they see
One of my friends work in a industrial area and he always tells me how dogs there attack cars and rip their parts of
That’s kinda how the food chain works though
Do you get mad when cats eat rats
Dogs in cities are fed and usually very friendly but if they live in rural areas with a pack they have to be more wild and territorial if they want to survive
Cats are better predators than dogs are so they are a threat for them
It’s a normal reaction
So its a problem
No, i dont want to put myself in danger just because bunch of people love stray dogs
that kind of dogs are in big places like karşıyaka (i live in izmir so i am giving places in izmir as an example)
In smaller neighbourhoods dogs even attack people
There are shelters for dogs already
What do you suggest
Kill stray dogs or turn shelters into kill shelters
I believe we should put most of these stray dogs in to shelters but the problem with that is shelters are very low quality
There are not enough shelters
If you don’t turn them into kill shelters -shelters that kill dogs/cats after a certain time limit- shelter option is not an option
Leave it as it is, kill stray dogs, turn shelters into kil shelters: you need to choose between one of these because another option is not economically feasible
Kebab is not a sandwich its a way of preparing meat Döner which is a type of meat,between two breads is a sandwich
Kebab is a different food group its incorrect to call a Döner Kebab a Kebab
Ankara is the brain and Istanbul is the heart of Turkey
Ankara makes decisions government is there
Istanbul is economically, historically and with population it is like second capital
Far as I know Turkey is centralised
I heard that Amsterdam has a flag
Is that true
Interesting
I used to think cities (or states) having flags was only in the US but apparently a lot of cities have flags
Hatay did have a flag, but they were independent at the time
We have coat of arms for every city but only hatay has a flag
Most of the coat of arms have a mosque on them
During my studies, we didn’t have any required but recommended list
The most difficult one was Nutuk
It was recommended to read in 8th grade and it is full of words that I didn’t know and experience was like you can read it but don’t understand a thing at all
This is why I have hard time remembering it
You can work your butt of in highschool to get in the first 1000 to study medicine for 7 years and start working for 350 euros a month
Turkey moment
There's something about Swedish that sounds so melodic, so I'll have to go with that
Government propoganda, TRT
But we also have different popular channels too
TRT1=(Turkish Radio Television) used to only tv channel in turkey back in the day now they produce turkish tv series about turkish history such as :
Diriliş Ertuğrul(Osman's father),
Kuruluş Osman(ottoman emp
founder),
Payitaht Abdülhamit (one of last and significant ottoman sultan)
And some series about Turkish war of independence
they are nice and some are very popular around south america asia and africa
They produce tv series with our tax money
You forgot to mention they are a state propaganda channel
yeah, they produce propoganda series like [Teskilat] [Kizilelma] [Ertugrul] or [Filinta] with our taxes
I guess they do, their production quality is better than older years
You can't answer negative questions with yes/no
İf someone asks you "Didn't you go there ?", no matter you say yes or no, you will be saying that you didn't go there so in order to avoid confusion, you have to reconstruct the entire sentence like: No/Yes, I didn't/did go there
Not a big deal but annoys me a lot
There are too many foreign words in our language
People use too many foreign words when it isn't needed and it's annoying
We have a circumflex for when vowels have different pronunciations but nobody ever uses them so it is common to make reading mistakes
For example, hâla(yet, still, regardless) is generally written the same as but pronounced different than hala(aunt on paternal side per blood)
Regarding the hala point, we also have annoyingly specific terms for family, like baldız(sister-in-law), bacanak(the husband of one's wife's sister) or görümce(the sister of one's husband) or elti(the wife of one's husband's brother)
Confusing, I know
Yeah it bugs the hell out of me too
They’re mostly pretentious college kids who thinks using an English word in a sentence makes them look intelligent or cool
It doesn’t.
Karakter means charachter in Turkish lol
French, Persian, Arabic are the most common ones as far as i know
Although for French people  wouldn't know it's French, they'd think it was English
For example words ending with -tion
>when people use the english word when there's an equivalent
> but do people use it noo lets just take the english word and pronounce it wrong
This is the exact situation
Why use stupid fake words (customised from their origins to try to fit the Turkish language) when you can use the proper ones in your own language
It drives me crazy
There is a small movement about this situation but it isn't well heard as far as I know
Nonetheless people directly assume that you're a "Türkçü/Ülkücü" (that's what nationalists get called) when you use the actual Turkish word instead of some stupid Persian/Arabic words and phrases
#####TLDR; we're on the same page
Exactly lol
We have the same thing in Turkish
*Ottoman Empire intensifies*
Greece, Bulgaria, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Georgia
Well, this should be fun
Closest relations or geographically to capital
If its the former, that'd be Azerbaijan
Happy marriage
If it's the latter, that'd be Bulgaria
Not exactly a happy marriage but it could be managed, considering we far outnumber them and I don't think the relations are as bad as say, Greece or Armenia
idk
When I would see Switzerland having 4 official languages I didn't realize it was regional so I thought everyone spoke all those 4 languages + English
I was incredibly impressed since I was struggling so hard just to learn English
In turkish Sweden is "İsveç" and Switzerland is "İsviçre". I believe most people in Turkey are just like you
always has been
well, this applies to 80% of western europeans

Not sure about the name but "Miracle in cell no
It is really popular
It used to be more popular at these days beards were referred as  "makeup of the males". This is changing thought, there are a lot of teenage girls in Turkey that admire beardless Korean man in K-pop videos
Kind of but it's kinda hard for turkish people to grow moustache cause not being indo-european and all
Yes kind of
[This] would be Islamist moustache
[This] would be Turanist moustache
These are not that common strong symbols anymore but still exist and avoided by people with opposing ideas
Yes kind of
That moustache can change a lot
Turanist moustache has much more stable look
I am hesitant to say something good because we thrive when we are the underdogs but do dogshit when we think we are good
And it looks like we are in form right now, so we will lose against Wales and Swiss :D and draw against Italy
My realistic expectation is to reach round of 16
If we reach round of 16 and exit the tournament, I would feel dissatisfied but not disappointed
If we reach quarter-finals, it would be above my expectations and would feel satisfied
More than that is a bonus
I think our defense is very elite this year but we lack offensive power
So it should be enough in the group stage but after that it just comes to luck
We have a good generation this time, I hope we can use that

Considering Turkish is spoken by more than 75 million people as a native language and the fact that Turkish speakers generally have poor English, absolutely not
Thanks to our bad education system students at only private schools can speak decent english so there is no risk for Turkish
I guess the Turkish "eşkıya" who were some kind of bandits, although they also usually did vigilantism in areas without law&order
They remained commonplace in rural Turkey until the 1940s when finally stamped out by the gendarmerie
So that's where Turkish "haydut"(outlaw) comes from
Haydut here, means bandit, i love how all our cultures connect at one point
In the future
In 1924

Lol not all of them are from a single country
Nevermind my answer
6 total and 3 of them are in Istanbul so I wouldn’t call it easily accessible
daha fazladir
ankara, bursa, antalya, izmir var
belki baska bir sehirde daha vardir ya da ankara'da 2 tane olabilir
Senin dediklerin showroom kardeşim muhtemelen Wikipedia 6 diyo ben İstanbul dışında hiç görmedim ama İstanbulda 3 var ona eminim
Tabi update’lenmemiş olma ihtimali fazla
yok ben de baktim sitesine toplam 7 tane var
birkac tane de siparis noktasi var ayri olarak
Nah, not much of a problem
Everyone's black around here
Most people here are agreed that turkey is transcontinental and kind of its own thing
You'd rarely encounter someone who identifies as just European or Asian
As for the European part, it certainly is in Balkans
Depends on the region you are in mostly
North East of turkey is influenced by Russians , therefore Caucasian while south eastern turkey is dominated by middle eastern culture
West of Ankara , however is considered European
Generally speaking, I consider Turks  a mixture of middle eastern and Balkan culture
>Most people here are agreed that turkey is transcontinental and kind of its own thing
You'd rarely encounter someone who identifies as just European or Asian
This is more of a cultural or identity thing
Turks don't fit themselves to either middle east or Europe but people don't think Anatolia is its own continent lol :)
Turkey is a pretty diverse country
most Germans think we are hairy Arabs since we sent you our peasants as workers but when Germans have a trip to urban parts of Turkey they are surprised
Because we are not living in a movie, yes we do
I think shoes are pretty disgusting to wear in houses, we have slippers for indoors instead
Döner
There are 2 versions of it, chicken döner can be very cheap
But it can be dangerous too
Chicken is not too safe to eat from cheap places
Tacos
*(if i can consider georgia as my country)* [mcdonalds] [in batumi] ate once there, i have to admit that the place makes you wanna eat there
[İzmir’in Dağlarında Çiçekler Açar
] Even if this is different version of Caucasian March but this has the meaning of Greeks finally left city of Izmir
As well as representing end of Independence War
(Edit) [You can check out this version as well
[Hey Onbeşli] Story behind is that when 15 years old kids went to front line in Çanakkale(Gallipoli) as a soldier
[Different version of this song to get more attention towards nature
(with English subtitles)]
Each city or area has its own songs but these are known by nearly everyone
These songs are what I can think of right now
You can add more if there are other songs as well
İzmir Marşı.
İzmir Marşı, it's a song about the Turks entering İzmir (Which was invaded by Greeks) during The Turkish War of Independence
No, its very uncommon thing
Also they are so cute how dare people ate them OwO
O_o
Oh shit, just opened the thread to do that, and called out by top comment :D
Fun fact: We pronunce 10 as “on”. So Neon is very easy to learn
Ne10
lets see
As a general rule, it seems that elements widely found in pre-industrial society have Turkish names that obviously do not fit with their symbols:
Kurşun(Pb)
Kükürt(S)
Demir(Fe)
Çinko(Zn)
Gümüş(Ag)
Altın(Au)
Kalay(Sn)
Elements discovered later on tend to fit:
Uranyum(U)
Karbon(C)
So, most elements out there "make sense" but the vast majority talked about in daily life do not, hydrogen and helium being notable exceptions
Pretty much none unless you are in big cities
Also excluding pizza&pasta
Döner ftw
do you like kebab
are you greek
why you write this
i dont understand
It is always said geography is destiny whenever something happens
**Süleyman the Magnificent** (1494-1566) who was the 10
Sultan and among many things he was a very good poet
His divan (a collection of poems) has this famous 4 liner, where the first 2 ones are used in everyday life when the context arrives
*Halk içinde mûteber bir nesne yok devlet gibi*
*Olmaya devlet cihânda bir nefes sıhhât gibi*
*Saltanat didükleri ancak cihân gavgâsıdır*
*Olmaya baht u saadet dünyâda vahdet gibi*
**Translation**:
*There isn't another respected object among people like fortune*
*Fortune isn't worth as much as a healthy breath in this world*
*The thing as they call reign is just a world's struggle*
*There shan't be any happiness in this world without unity*
PS: today we use the word "devlet" as "state". So insead of the word "fortune", you can switch it with "state". It gives more depth to the poem as Süleyman was a statesman
How are we using this in daily life and in popular media
When we want to say that there is nothing more valuable than health, then we quote Süleyman
Saying that even our most powerful ruler (or one of the most powerful ruler) did say that as the ruler of everything
Even he acknowledged that there is something more important than ruling/fortune/reign
I love it because I don't remember we have played against Italy so far and we are going to play other matches in Azerbaijan, so we are a kind of host to the games
We played against Italy in Euro 2000 group stage
But yeah it has been a while
I am also happy that we will play in Azerbaijan
We call it "ve işareti" or "ve imi" meaning "and sign". Or we just call it "ampersant".
It isn't officially used in Turkish but I believe there's a Turkish version of it as well
Made with combining V and E in a calligraphic way like Æ.

Salad and meat is enough
Maybe some tomato sauce
1) Geographic location
Ankara is pretty much at the center of Turkey
2) When it first became capital, it was a railway hub
3) It had a pretty strategic location and wasn't occupied by the Entente during the War of Independence, making it a prime spot to base the Kemalist government in
4) Ataturk wanted to build a new city to symbolize the break from the past
Ankara, which was a small town at the time, was the perfect place to build the modern European-style metropolis Ataturk envisioned, compared to Istanbul which was a major city with a population of 900,000
Mostly because of its strategic location in the geographical centre of Turkey
Also, the parliament coordinated the war efforts from Ankara, so it was a symbolic decision
The other option would be Istanbul but it had been the capital of the empire for hundreds of years and thus was symbolising the monarchy; not to mention that it was dangerously close to the border now that the country has lost most of her land in the Balkans
Because Ankara is harder to invade compared to the old Ottoman Capital İstanbul and at the centre of Anatolia
Also its people supported the Independence War which allowed Atatürk and his friends to open a senate and organise elections
İstanbul was the last capital of Ottoman Empire
But İstanbul wasn't a safe place due to WW1 and monarchy losing its authority at Ottoman Empire
So they decided to build a parliament to declare democracy in the country
But first they needed to make sure it's at a safe place
So they chose Ankara, which is nearly in the middle of the land
Even after the parliament building being reconstructed 2 more times, Ankara is still the capital of Republic of Turkey
Oh, Istanbul’s population growth wasn’t natural, most of it was driven by immigration from lesser-developed provinces
For comparision, Turkey’s population grew about 8 times in 100 years(10 million to 83 million), while Istanbul grew 20 times(900,000 to 18 million estimated)
Ankara grew by 100 times, from 50,000 to 5 million today
My grandfather did his military service in Istanbul in the late 1950's. While I'm sure his eyes are tinted by nostalgia to a degree, he says the Istanbul of that time was way better - "a lot of green spaces, no concrete monsters and little traffic" in his words
It's a shame most of its beauty was destroyed
And Antwerp was probably the commercial center of Low Countries
Amsterdam rose because the new Dutch state blockaded Antwerp, and the trade then got rerouted to Amsterdam
During the 80 Years' War, the elites from Holland had gained major influence, so they actually were against recapturing Antwerp in the later years of the war
In summary, I think Amsterdam became first a very important city and then the capital because the Dutch lost Antwerp during 80 Years' War
Sikimden aşağı kasımpaşa - Below my dick kasımpaşa (Kasımpaşa is a name of an area in İstanbul)
Çok da fifi - very much fifi (I have no idea what fifi is
Çok da sikimde - It's very much on my dick (There is an irony here
We mean It's not on my dick
I  believe we can say the same for the Çok da fifi
Yes we have “Umdumda değil/ önemsemiyorum” which mean “I don’t care” but then we also have “takmıyorum” which literally mean I don’t wear same as wearing jewellery which in Turkish is “Takı” and I think that’s where the word “takmak” derived from
Its really sounding natural when you say it in Turkish though
I don’t care about you at all = Seni hiç takmıyorum which literally translate to I don’t wear you at all
“Sikimde değil” translates to “Not on my dick“ yet it means “I don’t care“. I suppose this is a slang but still you wouldn’t understand it
Koy götüne - Fuck its ass
You forgot most used one which is: "Sikimde değil
" Literal translation: "It's not on my dick
Yeah weird thing is it’s used by both sexes lol

IDK Why people are that mad over a caricature
As a muslim macron doing well ı dont want known as terrorist because of some idiots
I'm an exmuslim from Turkey
I have to say that most of our people doesnt pray daily
At highest it can be %10 percent
Not more of it
But as you know
Erdogan supporters are always acts like they are the most religious ones
Etc etc
When this thing happened in our country most of us really devastated
As you can guess the akp supporters normalised it somehow
Our youth is growing open-minded and not-religious
This is my only hope
And I also hope that We will be in eu with our european brothers and sisters with good meanings and civilised in the future
Im kinda full of thoughts as you can see
Thats why I needed to write something at the comments
Thanks you for reading
Freedom for dummies by Macron
I don't even like this guy but seriously, him needint to explain this tells a lot
he speaks calmly and accurately,daily french you would use is spoken in a different manner
People get mad over every fucking shit nowadays i just dont know why they are THAT mad
he is actually,nobody uses subjonctif in daily french
french presidents use it alot
Honestly Apple probably would have switched on their own at some point
They invested enough into the USB-c standard already
Now they have somebody to point at when the consumers grab their pitchforks
I'm sure plenty here remember what happened last time Apple changed their iPhone connector
And there are waaaay more iPhones out there now
I appreciate if anyone who interested and followed this news to help me understand the law
How can you decide the what will the universal charger
Share the percentage of market or its technology
How can you make sure that this one type of charger will help power high power laptop as well as lower powered laptop
Will this be overkill for low energy consuming laptop
Will/Can this law prevent companies doing design faults to make them buy their cable only
Apple will probably just include a USB-C to Lightning adapter in EU sales and call it complaint
Look at all of the happy Europeans here, not worried about Net Neutrality
Be more like Europe, America

The fifth and sixth pictures grabbed my attention
From what I understand, one looks like a shopping mall and the other is a home improvement retailer
It is more interesting to see that not only they are getting rid of billboards and signs found in private buildings and highways, they are also doing the same on the stores themselves
It feels like the country has a sign that reads ''This country uses product placement in its streets'' at the aiprort
\>  Street lights turn on at 5 PM when the sun is still up
Man same thing in Turkey
It's such a small thing but would make a great difference if every country did it properly
At least where I live half the street lights are broken and some streets are basically pitch black so it evens out a little at least
> United States of America
Pfff
Yes, that's idiotic
They should have driven cars everywhere and consumed as much as they could, right
What's idiotic about a striking protest to make your point very clearly
The responsibility doesn't fall to one country or region
I'm beginning to think it's too late and mankind doesn't have what it takes for unprecedented changes
Everyone around the world really needs to change their lifestyle so the world will have a chance
Otherwise the world is gonna give us some unprecedented changes soon
Unlike [this guy] they probably know what they're doing and are aware of the dangers
They are not gonna drop dead, don't worry
Moreover, even if they somehow died, they'd still deserve respect
It would be a very unfortunate way to go but they are not some YouTube pranksters, they would have died to protest with the hope of finding a solution for the most important problem the humanity has ever faced
Mamma mia grazie tante
She doesn't have a point, this is flat out populism
Ronaldo isn't paid by public organisations, unless she believes she lives in a country that is organised as a communist state, her argument is just invalid
Her standards of living has nothing to do with footballers' income
Ronaldo can say ''I pay at least 600 000 euros per month for that million I get, not my fault that you don't get a decent money''
Besides, is there a proper base amount of income to find a treatment
Like, if she was paid 10 000 a month, would she be responsible
Simple case of demand and supply
Football players earn that much because people keep wasting money on football
Stop watching football, don't buy apparel, stop betting
But it's not gonna happen
The masses need something to forget about their misery for a while
I dunno man seems like robbery to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I strongly believe nations such as GB or germany should give back these wonders to country of origins
at least with reperations
(the prices it took to uncover and carry these to their homeland)
I have visited british museum and was shocked to learn %15 of all museum is from turkish homeland and  % 8 was from greece
mouseleum of halicarnassus
which is an ancient world wonder was for example stolen from turkey illegaly
But turkey could not get it despite 30 years of justice seeking
Both turkey and greece have strong archeological museums
this is a value created in this lands it is not just to take it to distant locations for glory
it may be the best museum in the world but most of the items have been stolen
UK have tons of stolen artifacts around the world and should give them back
Step 1: steal shit
Step 2: "SHARING IS CARING
Although the situation is slightly different, the way Turkey and Hungary handled the artifact situation was pretty examplary I'd say
Turkey and Hungary renovated Ottoman remnants together, adding plaques that explain their significance and also other works by their architects/funders which are mostly in Turkish borders
More tourism revenue for Hungary, more advertising for Turkey's tourism/culture
Again, not exactly the same because those are mostly whole buildings and not smaller artifacts, but if both sides are willing there are always possible mutually beneficial solutions to be found
I'm a pretty tidy and careful person, so you wouldn't have a problem with it if I stormed a really messy guy's apartment, beat him and stole his shit because it'll be safer and last longer with me
Military artifacts have different traditions about them and Moldova never formally requested it afaik, but I'd personally argue it should be returned if requested as well
Looks cute
I hope turkey will have its second Female president after erdoğans wild ride
polls show he is to go
But I hope it will be a women
Women of  great positions are always giving courage to millions
Was sitting on this for a while eh
US bombs Iran to stone age
Millions of Iranian refugees go to Iraq / turkey / Pakistan (Iran has 4x population of Syria), with none of the countries having resources to take any
So, some (millions) go to EU
Far right surge in EU, potentially increasing anti-EU rhetoric
EU needs to do something to stop US from attacking Iran
I'd even say it's existential for EU
Suleimani was the most powerful military figure in Iran and declared as a war hero by the Islamists in 90s. Now they are talking about a retaliation(s) against this act
I despise Iran's current regime but I hope this doesn't drag my country to a series of battles(I think war has a very little chance to occur) since Erdogan likes to be seen powerful
I assume if this escalates, NATO will join due to its geography and situation that Turkey in Syria
Can America and Middle East do their fight on where it is not bordering to Turkey

LOL what's the point of acting like Trump is the only guy who wants war
Your country is a war machine
It has been like this since the day it was established
Trump is just the guy you have in this decade
You've had tens of those in the past
Most likely, you'll keep having them in the future as well
I don't blame average American citizen for what the US government is doing but please stop virtue signalling and singling others out because it looks kinda funny
This is your country
This is what it does
It fights wars, sells guns, makes money
It is relentless, is always hungry for blood, wants total domination and has great propaganda skills
Trump is an actor among many others
Blame the foundations of your country, not some random citizen who thought electing Trump could be a better choice

The child in the left made me laugh
If the bold green implies majority then this is easily the worst map I seen about this topic
This is highly inaccurate I can't believe how this map is allowed to be even posted in this day
Its completely random the green parts are not based on anything and overlap with lands we knew had kurdish or arabic minority
Someone looking at this mapn will think half of Turkey was majority Armenian
Fully ignores the Armenian minority that still exists in Turkish borders
Light green should be exist in good chunk of the eastern Turkey
Genocide is real but it doesn't excuse this blatant incorrect map
Point of genocide remembrance days is to remember the correct history and to take a stand against political revisionism it loses its point when we just lie in other direction
**Copy pasting the OC's description from source:**
I know it’s not the first map regarding the Armenian population before and after the Genocide
But I have decided to do an own map which is a little bit more detailed and better looking
It should be considered that the Armenian population at that time was divided between 3 Empires
The Persian Empire, the Ottoman empire and since 1828 the Russian Empire
I have used different sources for the different parts of the map at different time periods
Keep in mind that not all green dots represent an Armenian majority
They can represent an Armenian majority, as well as a significant or visible Armenian community (mostly in reference to the larger cities such as Kayseri, Tabriz, Halep or Adana which had, as a whole, a Muslim majority, but a visible Armenian city quarter or community
The light green color is representing the coherent Area
To let you understand how I have worked and which sources I have used:
**The historical part of the map**
For the Ottoman part of Armenia i have used [the work of Sevan nisanyan]
It’s in Turkish but I had a bit help with the translation
He has made a detailed map about Armenian geographical name changes and Armenian settlements in the 19th Century - the second map I have actually used for this map
The difference is that Armenian geographical name changes are places which were originally Armenian - probably in the ancient and early medieval times
But in the run of time, since the 11 century, several conquests, forced emigrations and the settlement of Muslim - Turkish & Kurdish nomads, has changed the demographic distribution
The Armenian population shifted to the south and westwards
For the Russian part I have used a [ethnic map of the 19th Century]
The Persian part was a bit difficult, because there are no much ethnical maps
I have used [this wikipedia article] which list Armenian churches in Iran
By my logics everywhere, where a Armenian church is, was most probably also a Armenian village or at least a Armenian community
I have put these locations [into my Map] and colored them
Most of these locations are in the Iranian province West Azerbaijan (not to confound with the Azerbaijani republic in the Caucasus)
West Azerbaijan (Iran) was in some time periods also a part of the Armenian kingdoms - part of the Armenian provinces Vaspurakan and Barska hayk (= Persian Armenia - in Armenian language)
But there are also some in Isfahan, which are located in central Iran because in 1604 many Armenians were deported by shah Abbas in view of his scorched earth strategy during the Persian-Ottoman wars in the 17th century
**The todays part of the map**
After the world war the Armenian community in turkey was nearly fully destroyed
the last remaining significant Armenian communities are in Istanbul
The village [Vakıflı] (in Hatay) is known as the last remaining Armenian village in Turkey
Because it was added to French-Syria after the world war and then given to Turkey again in 1939
There is also a village southward of it called Kessab
But its located in Syria in the immediate border to Turkey
I have used [this Wikipedia article] for Syria
In the northeast of Turkey (Rize province) there are 2 villages inhabitant by [Hemshin Armenians] \- Armenians who were Islamized in the 15th century and lost their connection to the Christian Armenian community
But I have not included them, because they have lost their connection to the Armenian community many centuries ago and identify themselves rather as Turks as Armenians
This is also why they were not considered as Armenians by the Ottoman government and stayed in their villages
There is an unknown number of krypto/hidden Armenians in the eastern provinces, who have converted to Islam and changed their identity to Kurds or Turks
The Armenian community in Nakhichevan (Azerbaijan) was expelled in the first world war as well
But there was still an Armenian community left in Karabakh/Artsakh, Ganja, Semaxka, as well as in Absheron
But after the Karabakh war in 1988 the Armenian community in Azerbaijan was expelled as well
With Exception of Nagorno Karabakh, which is de-facto separated from Azerbaijan but still internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan
It should be considered that before the Karabakh war there was an Azerbaijani community in Armenia as well
In the east side of Lake Sevan, parts of the Syunik province and Yerevan
But after the Karabakh war they were expelled as well
So for the republic of Armenia today, I have used this map of the [population density] Just a bit more colored
For Georgia i have used these 2 maps
The Persian part was again difficult, because there are no precise Datas
Or at least I have not found them
But during the Genocide there was Ottoman campaign in Persia
Many Armenians were expelled from Iranian Azerbaijan
And after the Islamic Revolution there was a huge emigration
**Some other maps which I have used as an orientation were these ones**
What a pity
One of the shameful marks on our history
It's even more shameful we have people denying it
They say shit like "they deserved it". Monsters some of these people, I tell you, monsters
They made the situation so bad, mods outright ban you in history subs if you even DISCUSS the genocide, like the numbers and "operations". Shame
Who wants to bet how long until this gets locked
strange timing, again /s
Let the downvotes come
This is a terrible map with little to no accuracy either in the 1915 or modern part of it
Yes its started 105 years ago
>the Kurdish who took over a bunch of land
Kurdish people have been living in Syria & ME for thousands of years
The Hamidian massacres mostly happened in Anatolia proper
It was a divide and conquer approach
Not to forget all the Turks who got killed during Enosis by Georgios Grivas in Cyprus too
We all have done bad things
But what Greece has done to Turkey outweights to what Turkey did
Like the invasion of Ismir and many more
There is even a hollywood movie featuring Russel Crowe about it called the Water Diviner
Please,Turkey doesn't want to join to EU anymore,I think all world has seen that how EU works,after Coronavirus Pandemic,your EU will collapse
I humbly disagree my friend
There are about 13-18 million kurdish people in Turkey, including my Math teacher
They used the source wrong the one about Turkey is a map of villages that had Armenian names and were changed later on in Turkification of Turkey its not a map of Armenian majority regions those villages could have any number of different ethnicities
Also many of those villages are small settlements thats why they are dots meanwhile OP's map gives the impression that bold green areas are majority Armenian
Its not suprising that you don't care about history one bit I cleared my post a bit more to prevent you people from acting like idiots towards me but guess I was not fast enough
Why would anyone with a brain bitch slap a race that isnt even minority in the country
Im not saying its ok to bitch slap them if they are minority but if you treat them equal in your country why would you treat them badly outside the borders
I dont know how much you know about Syrian civil war but Turkey sent its forces just to create a safe zone
There are already 6-8 million Syrians Turkey
In that safe zone there are at least 1
5 million Syrians

Politicians and media lies constantly about anything
There can't be reelections and re-referendums just because they did something they always do
It's the voters responsibility to weed out misinformation before making decisions
> in democracy it's not like you vote once and that's it
Neither it is voting repeatedly until the sheeple make the the choice you want
People talk big about democracy but in the end everyone hates democracy if it gets the result they don't want and love democracy if it gets the result they want
You can't even elections every week in case someone changes their mind
People need to take some responsibility for their actions, but it's easier to blame things on the system
What if UK has a referendum again and they decide to stay, but then never have a referendum on this topic ever again
Shouldn't UK have a "should we leave EU" referendum every 3 years because apparently that's what democracy is
> And no, misinforming the public and willingly lying are not ok things to do and again, referendums have been remade for less
Yeah lying is bad
So are earthquakes, death and stepping on a puddle of water with socks on

> Ironically this one was not legally binding, meaning parlament could have ignored it completely - if it was legally binding the most probably outcome is for the result to be declared null
"I don't like what I voted for is actually taking place so politicians shouldn't have listened to the voters in the first place, because that's just how democracy works"
What's next
People protest-voting for literal nazis or communists or some other extremist fringe movement and being horrified when they get elected
People from all over the world, please take your fucking vote seriously
> After the historic 2016 Brexit vote in Britain, a survey conducted within days of the initial vote suggested that a number of Britons (7% of those who voted Leave*) immediately regretted their vote to Leave and would vote to Remain, instead, if given the chance
Reasons given by some people were that they were trying to cast a protest vote and "didn't think it would actually count".

You know right, there's a difference between a prophet and a politician
Why
Prophets has to live in modesty for making their commune bigger
Politicians are the generally the opposit
Yes, you have that right
But doing it is also disrespect
So, i also have every right to call you insensitive a..hole
That's what 1
8 billion people believe
What's wrong with respecting that
Well, that's true
There 1000's of article that criticize Islam
We're not against it
Drawing a prophet is already seen as disrespect at İslam
But mocking him with drawing
You can see why we see it as disrespect
Also
>Same with people who believes there's a magic skydaddy who thinks it's wrong to masturbate or that women are of less worth than men
That's not what Muslims believes
Majority is not salafi
Does it matter
>Mocking with a drawing is fucking harmless
Noone says it hurts
We're saying it's disrespect to our believes
Just because something is harmless doesn't mean it's respectful
>Islamic states do treat women less, stop pretending they're not
Yeah, the salafi ones do that
I'm assuming you've never heard Bektashi sect or Anatolian İslam in general
Ignorance is cureable you know

There is two versions of Europe:

Turkey isn’t in Europe, though

ugh
I hate my government
surprisingly low for a government like this in turkey
According to Europe,Turkey isn't a European country
So,why is Turkey here ?
Can’t count the dead ones(my mistake , disappeared ones)
Would not change the result
Radical secularism of Turkish institutions then would still hold true which would result in  support for AKP in public still because they still would have the “abused by power” narrative that Turks love to root for
Getting sick of coalitions in public and also for foreign investors would also still hold true and AKP would still commit to neo-liberal project of the west and would still get that financial support from the west
Those are much bigger factors for AKP’s 2002 election win than the 2001 crisis
Hell, there is not even a narrative like “AKP fixed 2001 crisis” in Turkey, people talk about and give that credit to Kemal Derviş and say AKP continued his economic policies
Of course the latter point is/was a praise of AKP within neoliberal and liberal circles both within Turkey and foreigners but never given them the lion share of credit
Watched them getting called terrorists and being sent to prisons literally made for them live on tv
I disagree, first even if one more party joined the parliament AKP wouldn't have a majority and secularist parties would have feared a second "28 February Incident" not to mention there were many DSP and ANAP and other such party supporters voting AKP for purely economic reasons which would take away votes from AKP and likely would put DYP,ANAP and MHP over the threshold
How would getting sick of coalitions make people vote for AKP exactly
And their neoliberal policies were held by ANAP aswell
It might not be AKP fixed the 2001 crisis but it is the narrative that they made the economy grow, which was mostly thanks to the pre-AKP reforms under the DSP-MHP-ANAP government, the economic boom Turkey experienced would have happened largely under the DSP-ANAP-MHP governemnt if the election had taken palce in 2004
I am not saying they wouldn't be large party, I would expect them to be the main oppositiin but they wouldn't able to ride the wave of the economic boom
I guess our main disagreement comes from:
a) I think centre right voters voting for AKP mainly happened because of the support of western neoliberal investors so it’d have happened regardless because I believe they would not support a coalition like that as they were looking for political stability
b) ANAP was dying anyway to me and even though they had the same neoliberal policies, their party was not going to start inspiring confidence again in both their voters who switched to AKP and also foreign investors no matter what
The root of my thinking of this is mostly due to “Derviş fixed 2001” narrative
You also say AKP does not have that narrative
Yeah, they have the narrative of economic growth but that narrative took place *after* 2004 imo and hence that coalition would not have the narrative of them fixing 2001 like AKP does not have it
The other root of it is that I think foreign investors were done with coalitions and passionately rooted for political stability even if your argument with regards to public opinion changing with election being in 2004 and them seeing economy being fixed during coalition government and switching to supporting them is valid
You can't break that cycle because it's the essence of nations
There will always be nations hating each other for what their grand-grand-grand-whatever parents did to each other, those nations wouldn't exist without that hatred

Why America's presidential election system is not based on popular votes
I thought Trump was losing in 2016 because I didn't fully know America's electoral system that time
Getting millions less votes than your rival and being elected as president seems wrong to me
Biden got 4 million more votes, but in some states if around 20 thousand people voted differently, Trump would be president again thanks to electoral college
This is weird
After the Trump i hope they don't start randomly bombing the Middle East again
Sorry but we are too full to get more refugees
Dear Americans if you again have intentions to bomb middle east, aftermath please take the refugees to your country
Don't put another economic burden on your dear poor nato ally
I hope this election will be good for World Politics
Probably most of us saw that coming from miles away
right
As a pro eurasian I'm happy, With this election Turkey will be able to leave Nato and make an alliance with Russia and China
If we do this we can prevail all region
yep literally the biggest reason i was hoping he would win
i hope he can do good even without the senate
Yeah buddy we're expecting sanctions, too
And probably start a new war in some 3rd world country and cause another migrant wave
He IS the senate
Why tho
Trump was better than let's say Bush or Obama
No new wars
And more pressure to China
Although there are 50 states in America, elections seem to be lead by only 9-10 states
Presidential candidates only really concentrate at these swing-states
Doesn't seem right to me
Actually I'm not a pro eurasian
I only wanted to see European people response when I wrote this
And I have seen that lots of European redditors have mental problem, because If I had said that I'm pro EU intstead of I'm pro eurasia, people would have downvoted me again
You are right but, you are wrong too
I know, Turkey isn't a super super super power but, Turkey is one of the big powers in mediterranean and middle east
Turkey's military power is strong and also Turkey has military bases over 10 countries in these areas and with military power Turkey has influence on these countries
Yes, Russia and China isn't ally but, they are close to eachother and Turkey has strategical location for Russia and China
Turkey is important for Russia because of straits and mediterranean and Turkey is important for China because of Economic
That's what we're hoping
Though Biden might make our lives considerably harder, the problem starts at the top of our own country and that's exactly what needs to change
he can still do plenty with executive orders though right
and in any case democrats would better win the the reruns in georgia this january
You say that like it's impossible
Only thing Islamists hate is other Islamists
Obama had no a good record on that for comparison
His actions in middle east was far more severe than even Bush could accomplish
Sry but Trump being anti-war was much more preferable and Democrats are not reliable on this issue
Let's see which random country will Biden bomb

Khajit wannabe
Fucking Chad
He and his colleagues in the conservative party weren't elected with the knowledge that he'd be PM and his personal platform would be the government's policy
He has no mandate to govern
Especially so when his party is in confidence only because of a tenuous coalition
But what about Corbyn
Why no Turkey
where tf is turkey
All of Europe is just a giant forest
So Turkey is not European
The UK blows my mind because it feels like we have so many trees
I think I've seen on these things that Turkey has more forest cover than UK
I suppose it's just that at a micro-level, the parts of UK I live in have a higher than average forest cover and the parts of Turkey I go to have lower than average forest cover

It's ministry, so it is a govertnment institution
You must obey the protocols when hiring for government
In free market, nobody cares who you are hiring
Look at all those female majority, white majority or black majority companies
It's not against the law
You can hire a street vendor instead of a MBA graduate for your companies CEO position
But when it's for government there should be some rules
For example; today in my country(Turkey) daughter of the state council member appointed to very high position as a "judge" at her first day at the job
Ironically, these people are graduated from law school and gonna bring justice to this country
No, it was never like that
It is true that there was only one election to elect the president and the vice president, in which the candidate that received the highest number of votes would become the president and the one that received the second highest would be the vice president
However, electors used to cast two votes
One of the electors would be given the task to vote for the president and not to vote for its running mate
By design the difference in electoral college cannot be less than 6, if it is not tied, so the opposition candidate had no chance of winning the presidency/vice presidency
Rest in peace my buddy
This sub is much more far right than European average though
Just check threads about immigration and then actual numbers in polls about immigration in Europe
Since mid-2000's far right is on an internet crusade, anywhere they aren't kicked out of they will eventually end up controlling because regular people don't want to deal with their bs and leave whereas your average neonazi has nothing better to do than pissing people off online
Mods let them have their fun, sub ended up here
If it was deliberate or just a misguided attempt to communicate and uphold free speech, that's a question for the mods
Idk, there are plenty of German fascists here as well
The "right wing" here on this sub doesn't really look like regular European right either, it's more like fringe neonazis than traditional conservatives
My best friends are studying in Munich and I visit them often so I can say with some confidence I know what a conservative right wing German looks/thinks/speaks like
Met the kind of "right wing" types you see here once or twice max irl
Judging by this sub alone one would think 1/3 of all Germans were a bit to the right of AfD lol
Sure, how can you know someone's political alignment from a contemporary political discussion right
Maybe the guy that thinks immigrant boats in the Mediterreanean should be sunk is a leftist, who knows
If the "strict immigration" here refers to drowning refugees, yes, it is a far right position
an accident, terror attack or something to do with gilets jaunes
Why are they downvıting you isnt this a legit question
As a turk that join gezi this peaceful protest are useless
You merely adopted the shame
Governments should disincentivize being anti-vaxx
I mean we shouldn't purge them all and we should give them the opportunity to be anti-vax but it should come with a great cost for them
75-80% vaccination in a society is sufficient to protect the country
Uhh
Looks like someone was really proud of his/her kid's drawing
Brilliant
So many protests everywhere
Thanks
Dude, that was 4 years ago
Erdogan used that coup to full extend and become defacto dictator of the country
Fire of Reichstag kind of shit but this time someone really started the fire
Bro I literally made the same joke today FUCK
> my 13 year old ass
You're still only a baby now lmao
Man I'm old af
"We are now at a point where words end in the fight against terrorism
We are now at a stage where this should be put at the forefront,"
Erdogan also said this he had some decency back then
One simple question; was attacking and killing isis members an oppression and ethnic cleansing against Arabs
If no, i beg for someone to explain to me why is it for Kurds in case of another acknowledged terrorist organization which i lost friends to their attacks
Open the border
My first comment on reddit, been here more than 1 year indeed, just haven't posted nothing
It's difficult to see any hatred word or insult by Turks to the 'Kurds' (not terror groups) since the operation has begun, unless we are insulted
All we do is expressing ourselves and trying to explain the need and necessity of this operation as citizens of a country which has been target of terror attacks countless times, lost thousands of lifes, fought against terrorism for decades, which borders on Syria and Iraq
And against all those sensible reasons, what we get from other countries is just nonsense false claims and accusations like ethnic-cleansing, Kurdish genocide etc
Just nonsense
Those MPs shown in the image are the member of a party which has close ties to the terrorist group PKK (which recognised as a terrorist group by EU,US,NATO)  and its Syrian affiliate YPG
So that's quite normal for police officers to prevent them from making a provocative speech which will explicitly or implicitly praise terrorist groups
Anyways, explanation of this image is that simple
So I want to move on
As I said at the beginning we are trying to explain our situation logically, as best as we can
While getting accusations from other countries, we're getting many things worse than accusation from the people, hateful words, insults, blames, racism
Absolute impudence and disrespect in brief
I'm always fully careful on the words I say and on the sentences I make, to avoid to seem like someone how you anti-turks want me to seem as
And when it comes to talk about Turks, Turkey, our ancestors and our history everybody feels free to say whatever the fuck they like
You keep trying to defame our history with your rotten arguments
You think you can be racist against Turks as you blame Turks for being racist and fascist
You don't even want to see the vandalism and wildness under the name of protests in your countries
Turks are getting attacked and injured by PKK supporters and Kurds only because they are Turks but what all you peace-lovers do is turning a blind eye to this cruelty, neither condemning nor saying anything about it
You think that any Turk on earth deserve to get killed and beaten because the Turks are blood-thirsty barbarians right ? Is this because you've been educated with the one-sighted genocide, war crime stories which made up by propaganda lobbies and never ever given a thought to search the history, facts, to see any truth
Or you Europeans just like having animosity towards Turks
That makes more sense, and better than believing in empty baseless lies
Because there must be some fucking reasons to ignore the reality of a terrorist group right
This is not only Kurds who treated like this, people are treated like this in Turkey
All you need to do is search the news before pointing one face of the coin to accuse something
[This is the democracy Kurds face in Germany
Civilians and journalists have been attacked by Hundred of German Police to leave the area when they were trying to make statement
It might be to protect them tho
Its not just erdoğan
Many secular turks are also this anti-democratic
It works well for erdoğan as he easily tames opposition by using hate against kurds
As a Turk, I confirm this
They support Erdoğan blindly but have no idea on what the fuck is up here
I'm pro-opposition but all i'm seeing is Erdoğan farming voters left and right
I think one of the main things uniting Turks is the Europeans reaction especially, Americans too but the Turkish-US relations went to shit years ago
I try to keep an open mind but it seems like in general we're either portrayed as barbarians who want to genocide every Kurd in the world and drink their blood or we're portrayed as the nazis 2
Trkey was always this way towards kurds, in fact even worse
If you keep supporting terrorists Erdogan never gonna fall, that's how he gets his power from his base
Lol
Ehh who cares about what Turks say anyway
literally *all of them* are brainwashed
What do you know about Turkish political system, especially HDP and its members, if I may ask
Yes they are
How are we doing a genocide if we have 20M Kurds in the country
It's only common with most Erdogan supporters (who make up less than half the country)
Yep, because of the tensions between radical secularists and politically Islamists, political oppression in different forms always happened basically
Also some marxist-leninist movements too for a few decades
Like, radical secular tradition of Turkish politics is really radical and well, political Islamists are political Islamists
But those were mostly between different fractions of power and never had an autocracy like this or long years of power like this from a politically Islamist politician
My point was it is easy to change the words or doesn’t show other side of the story
Every protest is treated like this in Turkey
Nothing particularly against Kurds
It's by no means a surprise that countries are condeming us, I saw it coming but I didn't expect to see such a reaction from European citizens and media
Sometimes it almost seems like i'm reading The Onion
I was expecting the media to explain the differences between Rojava, Iraqi Kurdistan (whom Turkey helped build and support) but they simple seem to label them as "kurds".
From what i've seen some people have a hard time differentiating between Turks supporting the army and Turks supporting Erdoğan which is understandable because Erdoğan makes it seem like he's the one risking his life on the ground
Thank you, but by you I meant West
They shouldn't have been in the parliement in the first place
These "politicians" open up Abdullah Öcalan(founder of PKK) flags and PKK(internationally recognized terrorist organization) flags on their rallies
I mean
it's a fucking mess
Kurdish mothers gather up in front of their buildings and ask their sons back from mountains, they force Kurdish children to be terrorists, so these politicians are basically terrorists in suits
Then give me numbers, if there is a genocide show me how many have been "cleansed", how many have been killed
Edit: I see, only downvotes but no answer
I didn't know i was the entire turkish government and I don't follow erdoğan endorsed news
I see no genocide other than people saying genocide, either provide a solid proof or shut up
Civillian casulties in this 11 days of operation is so far 120, what a lousy genocide my forefathers rolling in their graves
Wow i didn't know dutches did an arab genocide
Before you say the obligatory wHaTaBoUtIsM, this is to point out your hypocrisy
I like how your entire argument is my argument is flawed
11 day going on operation with 120 civillian death is genocide
Single airstrike with 70 civillian death is not genocide
And its not a completely unrelated war

Me neither

True story
You do realize the entire europe saw many wars and occupations, right
If western europe could get back up after WW2 which was only decades ago, maybe stop blaming the ottoman empire for your problems that collapsed a century ago
It ended a CENTURY ago
Long before all of you were born
This is a new world and has been so for years
I say the same thing when people blame WWI for Turkey’s problems
If other countries got back on their feet and/or did better and not you, stop talking about second and third parties and focus on what YOU have been doing wrong
This entire region is master of whining and accusing others instead of taking responsibility and discussing solutions
P.S. WW2 was extremely destructive financially
Its affect lasted for years
P.P.S.  The assumption the Balkans would do better without the Ottoman occupation is nothing but an assumption
Good guys vs
bad guys
Geologically Anatolia is very new
It used to be a sea
There was also a landmass where the Aegean is
Anatolia rose and Aegean sank
There is a lake called 'Tuz Gölü', which means Salt Lake which a left over from that era
Creating a bosphorus from Black Sea to Arctic Sea would solve the issue
At geography like that it kinda becomes meaningless if a country's European or not
Armenia is just Caucasian, which some could call an extension of Europe
As for Turkey, the European and Asian parts aren't even noticably different
It's kind of a useless thing to debate about
Hot take: Anything to the east of Czechia doesn't qualify as core Europe
It was a horrible attack on secular values
A big left-wing Turkish newspaper tried to print their Muhammed cartoons in solidarity with French but they were raided by police
Imagine actually thinking human life matters lul
Some people I talked to in the streets legit said “they deserved it” about the Hebdo attacks
I’d like to assume that only a fringe minority thinks that, but my experience tells me otherwise
You guys could not begin to comprehend how most Muslims are
If I criticised Mohammad in a public space, I think I’d get beaten to near death by almost everybody in a 10 meter radius
Worst part is, Turkey is THE most secular and moderate Muslim country
People get capital punishment for this in others
in their mind it was jihad, so legitimate by Islam
Im an ex muslim and you are bullshitting people
Eh, Cumhuriyet is one of the more journalistic newspapers
They’re centre left and very concerned about the de-secularisation of Turkey, hence your perceived islamophobia
But keep in mind that Muslims read that newspaper
Also, any Middle Eastern newspaper will shit on Israel, that’s just a given
Israel killed Turkish charity workers on an aid ship, we’re still bitter about that haha
I really can not understand American neo-nazis
Their grandfathers fought against Nazis, were killed by them and they symphatise them
damn dude lol
Politicians should be as well fed as the most malnourished citizen in their country
One drone to rule them all
I find it cute when Americans learn about Centerism and how the Democrats are not actually on the Left
Also how when they find out that everything on the left is not Socialism
'A lot' is superior to a locked number that is now a ratio of 1:750,000
America has two upper houses
And when I look at USA all I see is "centre-right versus right".
Good luck passing a law
I disagree, such parliament is just one big distraction and an illusion of democracy
With two big parties, it boils down all the bullshit filler and single-issue parties into two choices
Much more efficient
Either way its hard to get everyone to agree with each other, but that's democracy
Still, It's easier and more efficient than getting 10 parties to agree with each other
American system is able to do more big changes easily than the European one
It is completely ridiculous to compare the European system to the American one, they operate completely different and a different constitution also states have less autonomy than in the EU
My saying is that the EU would be much more efficient if there were only 2 parties
What's up with Bursa having that single highest live on the map

Good job Greece
I hope I can see the day when MHP is treated as such in Turkey but yeah I am not holding my breath
Great job neighbours, congratulations
It's really interesting how much we share in common with Greece
Turkey followed a similar path of military interventions and far-right extremism supplanted by religious fundamentalist notions and historic/cultural revisionism
And these happened in NATO member countries under strict oversight of USA, UK and rest of NATO/Europe
They simply didn't care the values of democracy, liberty and equality getting abandoned just so they can use us all as buffer states against "communism" and USSR
Sadly, while Greeks punished their generals, we ended up glorifying them, their collaborators and successors run the country now
Glory To The Red Army

How much money are airlines losing over this
Are they going to hugely increase the prices in the summer now
I wonder why they didn't wait for 2 more days to post it
Anti fascists are the real fascists guys
This is so fucking wrong, USSR is the country that stopped the Nazis
What
I didnt claim that
Can you even read
USSR was preparing for the war against Nazis from the start, it is dumb to think they are somehow equal or allies
And that guy is right that capitalist were appeasing Nazis
It is recorded history
The only surprise was that Nazis attacked earlier than they thought
It was a known public opinion in both countries that they were each others biggest enemies
read the preparations part
Edgy 14 year olds: communism is great
We declared this day some anti-communist day because Britain and France didn't make an agreement with USSR so that anti-communist Nazi Germany and communist USSR would fight each other to death and then western capitalists would just exploit them afterwards but it didn't go as planned and USSR decided to fight Nazi Germany after getting stronger and made a deal to not get attacked in the meantime so that's why we treat them like allies because why not lolz
Btw never question why Britain literally gave Czechoslovakia to Hitler, we clearly are not allies of Nazis as those communists
I think this was what you meant
There's a few reasons, one being what Capitalism has done to my country
In an effort to combat Communist groups in the South-East, (who everyone calls Kurds(but there were significant ammounts of Turks as well))  the CIA funded far-right winged terrorism (The Grey Wolves and Alparslan Türkeş) who killed left-winged students or activists who wanted to stop the USA from putting ships in the Bosporus
I know people who lost relatives to them
This and a few other things make it very difficult for me ti support Capitalism

I disagree it's required to be clarified
Everybody understand third world countries with poor healthcare but not everybody will realize being in US when there is a global pandemic is a big risk
The idea that you are fucked if you get sick in US as a non-citizen with no insurance is not something a lot of people from Europe realize
You overestimate the knowledge of random young adult who has never worried about this before

Uh no almost nobody denies it btw
Its just all turks are together when foreigners says it
If I a Turk go and say to a Turk he will most likely not deny it cuz its true ffs
But the numbers are wrong its not 1
5m its around 700k.
It is interesting, that you can visit Turkey to chill
Anything above 25 degrees is too much for me
Can't wait for summer to end
Any reason for the increase of temperature
As far as I understand, this is not a normal situation

You can hate radical islam all you want, Europeans did this to themselves
Either not let them in, not let them radicalized or dont trigger them
It's like you have a bees nest in your home that you try to live with them

Turkish language doesn't have gendered pronouns too
Same in Turkish
I think Google has an option to translate for both genders for languages like Hungarian, Finnish, Turkish etc
This above picture happens if that feature is disabled
Same in turkish, we have "O"
Detroit Become Human
Same in Turkish
"O gitti" means "He/She/It went" . Google Translate haves bad time when it try to translate gender neutral things
Same in Turkish, "o" means he, she and it
In Turkish, "O" means he/she/it, same goes for Hungarian too I suppose
It is too crazy that two tribes moved to Europe 500 years apart and kept similarities between the languages
Edit: Google Translate just picks a gender if you try this in Turkish, results will be "He is beautiful
He is clever
He reads
He sews
etc".
Nice
Non gender language stronk
I thought only Turkish had this
Thank you for enlightmenting
The pronoun in Turkish is also "O".

Thank god in Turkey there are heavily anti-government and leftist newspapers still operating in Turkey like sözcü and cumhuriyet
Wait, what's with that Soros guy
Erdogan and his party also like to blame him in every opportunity
Ahahahah in Turkey it's totally the opposite
> I wonder if people would react differently if it was a 'fuck all (insert random minority)' sticker
Would people react differently if a person from an ethnic majority group (that has the priviledge and power than entails) makes a racist commentary towards minorities (who have disadvantages and disenfranchisement that entails)
Compared with the subject of this article which is a citizen (little guy, no power) making a commentary on authority figures (powerful figures)

Whoever made this deserves a public execution
Oh god somebody please kill it with fire
Im from turkey and what the fuck is this
Where is the kebab
If you called these meat kebab why did u fucking pour ketchup and mayoinesse offffffffff
The most not-national national dish i have ever seen
What's this abomination
Why the hell we don't have this in Turkey
That’s döner, not kebab
Tbh this kinda irritates me because it doesn’t look like kebab here at all
But ngl looks kinda appealing
I think they have that in beşiktaş.
That's just kuşbaşı pide lol
Hell yes
I would like to tell that I am %100 agreeing
Probably
Our whole foods are made with putting meat on a bread
Aga bildiğin iskender bu
olive oil fill up
grape leaf wrap
ruler liked it
imam has passed out
They literally invented pizza
Why is that irrelevant, anyway
Doner kebap you can find in Europe is just another fast-food
It tastes fine, but nothing particularly special
Iskender kebap, on the other hand, is the best way to eat doner by far
I strongly recommend, but it should be done properly
It is not something the average kebap shop at the corner of your street can do

Turkish version "Fransiz kalmak/I am French to the conversation" does not imply the "French Language". It basicly express that " I am foreigner to this conversation like a Frenchman"
So it is not about the conversation/language is not understood because it sounds like "French" but conversation is not understood because the listener is a "French".
I do not know why we use this expression
I do not think it is incapability of French people of understanding conversations in particular, but maybe because we are speaking Turkish and a Frenchman couldn't understand a Turkish conversation
Why Frenchman
Je ne sais pas
Can someone explain what's going on here
"It's no data"
Why is there a Chinese 爱 character there
I use all of them
is it normal
We say "Konuya Fransız kaldım" which means "I didn't understand/know the conversation". Also why everyone hates us lol
Iki tane durum var bu deyimin kullanilabilecegi;
1) ornegin iki tane arkadas gecen seneki tatillerindeki komik bir olay hakkinda konusuyorlar
Ucuncu bir arkadaslari geliyor yanlarina ama o ucuncu kisi tatile gitmemis onlarla
Bu iki arkadas konusurken ucuncusu ne hakkinda konustuklarini anlamiyor
Arkadaslari da ona "Sen bu konuya fransiz kaldin" diyor
Cunku, konustuklari konu ile ilgili hic bir sey bilmiyor bu ucuncu kisi
&#x200B;
2) Ornegin, iki tane muhendis bir proje hakkinda konusuyorlar
Yanlarina bir ucuncu kisi geliyor ve bu kisi bir bankaci
Bu iki muhendis proje hakkinda cok fazla teknik terim kullaniyorlar
Bankaci olan kisi de "Ben konustuklariniza Fransiz kaldim" diyor cunku onlarin konustugu teknik terimleri bilmiyor
The context is a famous poet goes to live in France for several years
When he returns to Turkey, he cannot understand what his other poet friends are talking about
His friends tell him "You are French to this topic
" So it is neither about language nor nationality but still interesting imo
I would put my penny to the theory that expression is rooted from old times, where a  westerner is equal to the French, and hence all foreigners are basically French
So a westerner wouldn't understand our language or even a westener speaks Turkish, still wouldn't understand the specific/complicated expressions/conversations
So a foreigner is most probably a westerner
A westerner is same same a French
Probably that is the reason
Taking into consideration that, European influence in Ottoman and Turkish times are mostly via French language
For example, gonorrhea is also called "French Disease/ Tur
Frengi" in Turkish, but not just because of is considered "French" but because it is considered "European/westerner etc". So roughly European=French
Well , Turkey is not getting along with too many countries and France is not the one with worst relations
It’s just an idiom
Highly possible
Its look like anor londo from dark souls rigth

How is this related to Europe
Same thing happened in Turkey/Antalya, they put bike lanes going towards and on the sidelines of the coast, after a year of cars not caring about the bike lane and the ones that do, reporting to the government that they dont want bike lanes, the bike lanes have been removed
I cannot read it but it is probably legal to be used as a parking some hours per day

When I visited the UK I first went to London and a year later I went to Edinburgh and I think London doesn’t stand a chance compared to Edinburgh
I mean Edinburgh has such a refined beauty
Architecturally it is just fascinating and has something the metropolitans and the common tourist destinations like london, paris, venice, istanbul don’t.
I fucking love Scotland, man
My type of country
beautiful city
As far as I know buildings in Edinburgh was made from light sand stone and then they got darker because of the industrial revolution
And I think the main problem when it comes to istanbul is that we had a similar antipariochi like the Greeks did in the 70s so Istanbul’s architectural and historical sites are concentrated in particular zones and there are really ugly neighborhoods in the outer city while in Edinburgh most if the buildings were protected and even the most common building keep up to the architectural standards
Nice read, thanks
Again, I am simply a tourist who visited the two cities
FOR A TOURIST I found Edinburgh more impressive
It’s not an absolute verdict I don’t know how to live like in these cities
I simply think I would rather go to Edinburgh than to London if I visit the UK again
Thanks for the advice

You can say whatever you want
Which is causing reaction from the Turks (as they are already paranoid about everything)
This subject will never be resolved as long as both sides keep their current mentality
Thank you :)
That's the problem, "deniers" says that there is no historical fact that Armenians were **systematically** killed, which is the definition of genocide

I hate Çamlıca Mosque but good photo
sadly there will be a massive earthquake on istanbul next 30 years
Well done you have captured the ugliest mosque in the whole city
I still laugh they went to capadocia with ships
Well actually it was commonly called İstanbul for hundreds of years
And both names are Greek
It’s just that legally the name changes in like 1928 or something
And post office stopped delivering mail to “Constantinople” at that time
Greeks you know probably aren't jerking off to the Byzantine empire and the Megali Idea
The one in Dark Souls 3
How so
The place where the guy stands and the place we look at in the photo both are not in Constantinople
They are up north and were inside the borders of Ottoman Empire before 1453
Cope
It is not Hagia Sophia lol
It is Çamlıca Mosque which was built in 2017
Ah yes, the absolute best part about Istanbul, the many, many adorable cats just roaming around
Truly a paradise for cat people
It's not a huge feat to build such structures any more
The photo is cool but the mosque was an unnecessary project, built by spending millions of dollars
No reason for it other than fulfilling Erdogan's power fantasy, and I'm pretty sure he wants it to be his tomb
because its architecture was copied from Hagia Sophia and the Sultanahmet
(even though it was built in 2017)
You mean this one
Well, I never thought it as a mosque, but they indeed look similar
&#x200B;
Now that we are at it, I have a question for you, something that I have been curious about
Do the mosques (or churches), or in general the architecture and cities of Europe and the Mediterranean basin (i.e. Arab countries) seem exotic and alien to you
Because for me, Chinese (and in general East Asian) buildings, palaces, temples, cities (the historical parts of them) etc
look so different and exotic, even alien, as if it was from a different planet
I wondered whether a Chinese person share the same impression, but in a opposite way
The mosque is the orange dot in [the pic] It was an Ottoman territory century before Constantinople fell
Constantinople is simply Fatih district of current Istanbul
Its population was roughly 40
000 back then
That they built that one is annoying, but I think the end result is going to be pretty nice to be honest, and that one has a way cooler and somewhat more unique design than the camlica mosque
Meh
Not only this mega mosque (that has a capacity of 63k people and never gets full) but also other "iconic" mosques like the one in Taksim Square could have much more modern&contemporary architecture like [this]
But because of Erdogan's Ottoman fetish and need to show off we just poured down millions to this huge concrete replica of medieval mosques in 2017 that has no architectural innovation
Thanks for your input
Well the Hagia Sophia is originally a Greek building, so it IS just as European as the Gothic architecture
Nevertheless I get what you are trying to say
But does the Western European architecture feel unfamiliar or exotic to Chinese, just as the Byzantine or Ottoman architecture does, or does it seem familiar (you seem to imply it does but perhaps I misunderstand)
After all Classical China and Catholic Europe are very different originally
It is a nice thing that they visit
Cultural exchange can only bring positives
I would like to visit China also, sometime
For me, if it wasn’t included with the ridiculous rules of “no bar etc within 300m or whatever, I’d have zero issues
But because of that I lament the addition of more camis, especially in parts of the city that are already full of camis, but at the same time I’m a big fan of beautiful buildings, which are few and far between in İstanbul
I don’t hate our vernacular architecture
I quite like it, but a beautiful building here and there is quite nice
That proposal for Taksim Mosque later was improved to [this] It had suras from Quran carved on its dome and the shadow of the script would fall down on prayers
It would look mystic and gorgeous, tbh and even I (I am not a believer) would be in awe of the beauty of the mosque
Yes, creating a concrete replica of a 15th century mosque implies "we could not develop a new architectural style in the last five centuries and just are nostalgic about it". Sorry I am not really a fan of the Ottoman fetish
Even a replica of Ortaköy mosque would look more modern
If that means you put semen in his coffee he's going to tell on you to Mutti, you guys

Isn't it funny though
Modern day Turkey founded after the Greco-Turkish war, which was a defensive war by Turks against mainland Greeks
So there is some history to it
But present day conflicts arise from disputes on islands
Greek Islands are all over the Aegan sea, some are as close as a few miles to Turkish mainland
And of course there is Cyprus
I don't know why everyone acts like they are an ambassador for their country though

We LOVE sitting

(Unless it's a small city and it's only gonna take 5 mins, then it's pointless to sit)

Even 4chan got blocked REEEEEEEEEEE
Honestly I have no idea how reddit is still open in Turkey since considering how much Erdogan bashing happens here I would have expected it to be one of the first sites that they would block
At least he didn't sell our internet rights to some cable company
I believe our internet will turn to normal when this guy is gone
To be clear once and for all
You are all wrong about one thing
Turkey is neither European nor Asian
TURKEY IS AFRICAN
i can't even open the image without vpn
It's the Islamist stache
Since Islamist AKP scum rules Turkey, everyone holding a political office has the Islamist stache
[Here you can identify social class and political inclination with staches]
We call it a "badem bıyık", or "almond-stache". Almost exclusive to the AKP and their people, including the Gülenists
They may have split, but the 'stache remains the same
It’s because %100 of all ministers are AKP sided and they are all hunks
Hahaha it's kind of mandatory
According to the rumors, which we have no idea if it's true or not, Erdoğan wants people to have a mustache
According to the same rumor it started as a joke but then became real
I mean it's really stupid so it's likely true
image hosts aren't. imgur and i.redd
it are both banned
Strangely enough I can still access 4chan and pretty much everything else from Bilkent (My University), except for Wikipedia which I need a vpn for
So I guess Wikipedia was blocked "specially" or something
Anyways Wikizero is a thing so no biggie
Not to sound elitist or anything, but politicians in Turkey are on the same intellectual level as taxi drivers and janitors
Erdogan didn't go to University, the current PM does not even know how the internet works
Most of the officials went to religious schools and rose to power via connections
There are a few scholarly ones, like Ahmet Davutoglu who has a PhD in Economics and Political Science, but they all got purged because they tried to run the government properly with principles
> He looks like the type of guy that talks about immorality and how people have no manners only to go home and beat his wife
This is exactly what most AKP politicians and hardcore supports are like
Why though
This is not the European Union subreddit as far as I'm concerned
Am moustache, can confirm
I ended up growing into a fully fledged Turk
It doesn’t really matter since all they do is to listen to the big president and do what he says
i.redd
it works for me though I don't think it is banned because that would even make less of a sense since reddit isn't.
Yes but in Turkey full beards are not seen appropriate in government positions or any high-ranking position really
I don't see how looking like a caveman makes you more pious
I can't access i.redd
it for the last 4-5 days

How dare my favorite medieval empire get defeated by another medieval empire, surely this must reflect on my opinion on internet arguments
1453 best year of my life
Where you from
i never saw someone calling the Byzantines as Romans
edit:ah the brigading
The term "Byzantine" is a product of modern historiography
The Byzantines, rather, the Eastern Romans, always referred to themselves as "Romans", the emperors referring to themselves as "Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans" by the end, that is, 1453
The West would call them "Emperor of the Greeks" to delegitimise the Byzantine claim on being the "rightful" successor to the Roman Empire, as they supported the legitimacy of the Holy Roman Empire
Correct, I was a college student when that happened
also it’s Conquest of Constantinople considering the city got better under Ottoman rule
you may think im giving a biased answer but it really has historical merit to it
Ottoman Sultan of the time Fatih took the Conqueror title after the battle since Constantinople was considered unbreachable for many years, and Fatih tried to keep the city unharmed as much as he could
A common misconception is that city lost its spirit after Ottoman conquest but it was still named Konstantiniyye,all the Greeks and non muslims were allowed to stay and take on Ottoman citizenship,and throughout the Ottoman dynasty city was valued and kept as the most advanced city title for many years
So i really don’t see the point of calling it as « fall of Constantinople » as in « fall of Rome ».City didn’t befall to Barbarians who sacked it

I live in turkey but i hate him and most of the turks dont support him they win by stealing votes and stupid people HE IS A DICTATOR in turkey if we say something bad about him they just send us to the prison
Damn this is true ...
Yes
[Insert depressive wojak]
True
Can confirm this post is legit
People would say "he still has around %40-45 percent support (among 100 voters, turnout is around 85-90 so you make the math)" but you should remember that the whole GOVERNMENT of Turkey is basically a propaganda machine right now
He doesn't rule and advertise it to the people, he rules by advertising
A political scientist called his government "A communications government, every action of his is a communications move, targeting his voter base or other governments or investors, doesn't matter

I hope it will end after 2023 election

Where is 128 billion dollars
Mf killed the economy last night, we will see what's coming next
just wait for 2023 the students will take over
fuck that guy
And now theres 128 billion dollar problem
Goverment doesnt say anything, CHP, İYİ Parties stil asking about "where did 128 billion dollars gone
" They even made a propaganda
[The Video]
This video is full of Bullshit
Two factors to consider here: propaganda and polarisation
Erdogan uses to his polarizing rhetoric through all the propaganda channels to divide the people
This way, he managed to get the votes of centrist spineless bigots
This doesn't mean all of his voters are die-hard supporters of him
He uses fear and hatred to attract those bastards
Fortunately/unfortunately, as the economy gets worse, those dumbfucks change their minds
That's why we can't talk about democracy without a proper media and freedom of speech
Why dont you post the [las held elections] Even If it was for mucipalities, it showed a thing or two
You think we actually vote for him
He always rigs the elections, if he were to lose he just says that the opposition cheated and makes another election
Niye downgote atmışlar
Haklısın. Bizim millet akıllanmaz
Some of the voters voted more than one and they burned some votes  (at least i think) but yeah hope he will be gone

Holy crap, in Turkey the rest of the sidewalk would turn and beat the shit out of the abductor
Are we living in the same country
We are only a little bit better than Belarus and our people don't even have balls to protest anything
Nobody would beat anyone for abducting people lol
Well the kids at bogazici clearly have more guts than you or I do
There’s been so many protests lately are you kidding me
And the police (in clear police clothing) have been arresting protestors
A friend of mine has been trying to get his friends out of jail for like two days in a row now
Also I dunno where you live but any kind of disturbance on my street is met by the people of my neighborhood immediately

Same kind of shit goes in Turkey
Erdogan’s channels say anti-opposition, anti-USA/EU/NATO etc kind of crap and whatnot (Whatever Erdo dislikes/opposes)
Poland is just like Turkey but Christian
Poland builds as many churchs as possible , follows nationalistic policy and says everyone is against us
Hmmm
that sounds very similar to TURKEY
This feels and looks all like Turkey in the last 10 years or so
I thought turkey was the only country that used this around Europe
No please no Turkey is surrounded by enemies
All the world against Turkey
It is like one day Erdogan came across on the street with Kacinski and Orban and told them;
„Guys, I have found an awesome strategy, you should definately try it, it works 100%. It is legit”
Never listen him

No way turkey's passport power is that high up
It's only good to use as an oven mitt or a coaster
I have a green turkish passport and i can travel visa free to 164 countries, exactly 67 more than regular turkish passport
suck it europe

im looking turkish it shows 93
Don't be sad bro
Yeah Turkey has been padding these numbers with visa waiver agreements with Djibouti, etc
Meanwhile I cannot get into Greece (driving distance) without a visa
Also, some Turkish municipalities have been trafficking people to Germany with service passports, truly embarrassing stuff

What kind of lunatic parents would want their kids to move out at 16 ? South Eu rocks
I thought we had it bad due to low purchase power but looks like it's pretty similar throughout
In Turkey, yes
Most graduates can't even find a job in their field
The ones lucky enough to find a job generally make minimum wage only
You can't move out with that
I'm 23 studying in the same city w/ parents and i'm on my last year of education and there is no sight of me moving out in near future
And living with your parents even up to 35-40 is kinda acceptable here unfortunately due to economic reasons
Absoluetly true, in turkey you can't leave your home(rich peoples aside) without educating the university because everything is so expensive, you need a good job to buy yourself a house, car etc
If you leave your house in your 18's  you need to work where ever you find if you are not a brilliant person and most probably will need to take credit from a bank because the salary they give you will be 255€ or less, it's in extreme difficulty here
It's a figure of speech
I don't think parents should make their kids work or get them to pay rent before they're at least 18-19
These kids've got a long time comsumed by work ahead of their life already
Why not just let them live their youth without  having them worry about rent and bills and shit
I think it's a dick move and doesn't matter what part of the world you live in
That kid still needs you

Just here to give my two cents
Using the Turkish flag in this graphic, and in general, assuming the Turkish Republic is the successor of the Ottoman Empire in every regard is historically incorrect
Sevres and Lausanne are seperate treaties, there was a period of time ('20-'22) both in Istanbul and Ankara two 'governing mechanisms' existed simultaneously and Turkish Republic forcibly droped all Ottoman images & cultural traits after '23; so much so that the last Assembly of the Ottoman Empire and the second (or third) Assembly of the Turkish Republic had almost no one in common
Kemal Atatürk rebelled against the Ottoman Empire in '19 to start the Anatolian resistance against invading powers
He was deadly serious about cutting all ties with the Ottoman lineage and for the most part, he succeeded in doing so
Now; this does not diminish the magnitude of Armenian Genocide, how traumatic it was for Armenian people as a whole; nor does it absolve the actors behind the Genocide from blame or responsibility
It's just something I personally wish people would think about more, in designing graphics like this and also for trivial stuff like calling the Turkish civ in Civilization games 'Ottoman'. Because Ottoman were not a nationality, it's the name of a royal family that an empire also got named after
Just this, nothing more
*sigh*
if its not against the rules , it wont be taken down
problem is , its little better than trolling to just come to the sub and post this pic without any discussion or meaningful post attached to it
I wonder do people think writing “but what about armenian genocide” on every Turkish related post does anything at all
Like whenever I read a post about Turkey, there’s always one guy that mentions it
It doesn’t even trigger anynone, it’s just annoying
He blamed the Holocaust* on the Dutch, specifically to cause conflict before an election
His party runs on an us-vs
-them mentality
since yesterday the sub is under siege by trolls , people are riled up, its not the best time for cool headed , objective discussion
ever since yesterday , people just flock to r/turkey to post "recognize it" or similar stuff on completely unrelated threads
this picture was shared by atlesat 10 accounts this morning, it gets tiresome
average turk will not recognize it,but every year there is more and more discussion , more people who step up to apologize and call for discussions , sadly , constant trolling and patronizing stuff is not helping the turks who are trying to fight against the circle jerk
The Ottoman governance considered Turks to be peasants in their borders and didn't even speak Turkish
They were different culturally from Modern Turkey which was built on the Turkish identity
>doesn't mean turkey gets a pass
Gets a pass at _what_? Sorry for being Ottomans, I guess
Most of our (Turks of today) ancestors were barely even aware of the war, they were nomads or lived in rural villages
'Turk' was even an insulting term when used on an Ottoman noble
Well, would it change your opinion to find out that between '23 and '50 the alphabet changed, educational system was overhauled, Ottoman clothing such as fez were banned and replaced with Western counterparts, the demographics were shaken up via population exchanges & forced assimilation, economic policies were shifted intensely and new alliances were formed
I'm not here to give Turkey a pass from anything
I'm here arguing, because I'm genuinely tired of people both in Turkey and outside of Turkey automatically equating the Ottoman Empire with the new republic
I thought I made that clear when I specified that this doesn't absolve anyone from blame or diminish the trauma of the genocide for all Armenians
Guess not clear enough for everyone
Ottomans are something 'other than the Turks' though
Ottoman Empire also had Greeks, Armenians, Arabs, Assyrians, Kurds, Jews, Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats, Albanians
The ruling class was Turkish, yes; but same way the Greek culture you mention persisting despite Ottoman dynastic rule; so did Turkish culture
Mind you the ruling elite spoke a mixture of Farsi & Arabic; as opposed to the Central Asian remnant 'folk' Turkish, which Kemal Atatürk made the official language once he came to power
As a Turk living in Greece, I only fully understood what this distinction is once I came here
There is a seperate 'Ottoman' culture that pervaded from the palace, through the governors and the kadıs to the public (I'm talking about sayings, food, arts, entertainment etc
); but was at best a supraidentity, never distinct enough to overwrite existing cultures
You are right, coherence in religion and language through history helped these cultures survive
Greeks are Greeks and Turks are Turks
Both have Ottoman influence
None are complete successors to the Ottoman Empire
Who are 'we'? As in the general population of this subreddit
Are you asking me to tell you if I want people to 'deny' the Armenian Genocide because I'm trying to make a point about the relationship between Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic
Because I'm not
Didn't think I was
I agree %100
There's a great journalist, Hrant Dink, who summed it up best in my opinion
He said 'The Turks don't want to confirm the genocide, because they don't want to accept that their ancestors could have done such a horrible thing'. I agree with him also
I recommend anyone who's interested in Turkish-Armenian relations to look up his speeches and writings
He was a kind, smart, gentle, wonderful man
But he was shot and killed in broad daylight, and the cops who brought his killer in took selfies with the hitman in front of the Turkish flag
As far as I know, no-one apologized for that either
A) Not denying the genocide
B) Not going to take a reply starting with 'Just No' seriously as an intellectually valid commentary on the proceedings
C) Where the hell are Italians considered successors of the Roman Empire, that should be an example *I* should've used
You are right
The CUP was very racially motivated and not that far from the Nazis, ideologically at least
But on a state level, the amount of power they held in late Ottoman period did not translate to the new Republic at all

You just engaged in nationalism

Europe always throws dirt on Turkey
Im just waiting for some Europeans to share some colonialism ideas of several Europe countries and their result of deaths lol
Turkish fathers cries for that too
Yeeeaaah, No
Turkey is a guarantor state in Cyprus obliged to protect lives of Turks in the island
The so called invasion is the right of Turkish government since she is  a guarantor state in Cyprus
Then government used its right due to the acts of terrorism against Turkish people in the island by EOKA
You can verify all of this with a quick google search
Edit:Typo
Welcome to the Balkans where everyone is invader and yet defender
Unpopular opinion: If Cyprus unites, violence will start again which probably will cost even more lives
Aww
Im sorry but ı cant hold myself moore, you and other 'western' subs always looking one sided
I can show you thousends of photographs which like that but Turkish father cries over his sons grave whitch killed by enosis "greek terrorist organization which aimed to asimilate Turks and be unite with greece" this operation triggered by increase of this kind of attack to Turkish villages, and ıts an operation which aimed to end this attacks and end both sides casualties
Do you realize that if military coup in Greece was prefented, massacres wouldn't happen and Turkey wouldn't be on island
Also, everyone deserves to live but children deserves it more than adults with rifles
You should not have try to exterminate your Turkish neighbors
If given chance i would serve in the army for a similar cause
Edit: Butthurt downvote squaaaaad
Don’t forget Syria, Iraq and Lebanon
thanks for ur support
They died 1000 years ago mate invading used to be popular then

They do this shit in every case
No wonder why Erdogan gains so much friction, especially from the Turks living in Europe
Then they accuse Turks of being brainwashed
Behold the Greek brigade will not approve of your post
How dare you have a different opinion
You got it
This time it Turkey should do nothing
And get accused of Turkish Cypriot genocide 50 years later
shut the fuck up bot
You forgot to add that Junta was toppled thanks to the Turkish intervention
Check a few replies below
r/turkey is a political s-hole like r/europe
Thats why theres an alternative r/turkeyjerky lol we just laugh at memes, dude
I suggest the same to you
>The killings of Turkish Cypriots were not done by the republic of Cyprus but by an anti-government terrorist orginization (EOKA B)
So it's okay if your son killed by a terrorist orginization and we don't have to talk about it
We don't have to talk about the actions of Greek Junta
I think you just confessed the hypocrisy of this sub, It's not about the rightness of the operation
I love how you guys see Alexander the Great as hero who actually tried to conquer the known world
Well it depends on how it happens
If it’s peaceful not much would happen
Solution to economy was money laundering, not related to any of this events
Says the British guy
Pretty petty argument
Cyprus is in europe
>Also a lot of Turks say that Greek Cypriot people deserved to suffer because of EOKA B actions, equating all Greek Cypriots with EOKA B. As Turks love to point that PKK =/ Kurds, EOKA B =/ Greek Cypriots
Huh
Where did I say that
Like I said, I wasn't pointing the rightness of the operation or anything
I was talking about the hypocrisy of this sub (and the western world)
Well some people might not like that
I just stated a fact not an opinion altough second part was but Greeks arent ready for facts
They just wanna play victim and score symphaty points here
>I just had to point it out that the atrocities were committed by terrorists that had nothing to do with the ordinary Greek Cypriot people that suffered due to the invasion
I never said anything like that
Same thing goes for Turkish Cypriots as well
>I don't see how what I said was hypocritical
Dude I'm telling this for the third time now
I'm talking about the hypocrisy of the western world - not you, not something personal - and this sub, cuz while Greek Cypriots are heros, no one mentions about the Turkish side
It's not something new, we Turks always experience this hypocrisy
We dont care i just stated a fact you like it or not its up to you
Both events pretty unrelated btw
Whataboutism
I feel like my credit card was somehow charged for even looking at this picture

Mediterranean is full of native white skinned blonde people as much as it is full of olive skinned black haired people
Our racial type is unknown honestly
Because we are Muslim and Asian people think we are freaking something else
But in reality we racially resemble Southern and Balkan Europeans much more than most Western people stereotype us to be
There ARE Turks that fit the Oriental "Brown" stereotype don't get me wrong
But there are LOADS AND LOADS of Turks who look like White Europeans
We are just a hell of a weird country on that sense, but considering our geographical location it makes sense
We aren't called a bridge for nothing
WTF is this

You are seriously underestimating the number of European looking Turks
I would say it’s more than Armenia

Under this sub or lots of subs, it is so common to find the expressions like "Turks genocided Armenians", "You first answer how you genocided Armenians" etc
This things are never a cause of ban or even a reaction of common sense
Please tell me how does this help our "Holy peacekeeping mission"?
On humanist base, I agree almost everything with your comment
However the reality is not that simple
Please comfort me by saying "this expressions doesn't help any to hatred towards Turks".
Let's not fool anyone, If banning something is what the powerful one wants, than it is banned
There is no logic behind it
My own country does this on lots of topics and I hate it with all my heart
When Europeans does it, I have no aim to like it, too

It's fake but in a sarcastic way

What a time to be alive, amirite
This is sarcasm why are you downvoting this
He does whatever the fuck he wants
In rallies his facial expression towards his supporters is sometimes like "you fucking retards, I can rape your mother and you'll still worship me right
There was a video of an AKP supporter who said "If I see Erdoğan and my mother on the same bed, the blame would be on my mother" so it's not like we are that far off from that anyway
*Yawn*. It is a wonder that they launched this at a time when capitalism’s failures are so bluntly apparent

(Not so) Fun Fact
Erdoğan doesn't actually rig elections
About %40 of the country is just too stupid to understand how democracy works
Years ago when he said democracy is a train he will get off at the right station he was being hailed as a beacon of democracy and hope & example for other nearby countries by Europe lol
It is amazing how Europeans now have the surprised pikachu face
The guy never even bothered to hide his intentions
He was the same person
You pampered him for years and now suddenly Erdo terrible
You don't say
FYI: We don’t like Erdoğan because he fucked our economy, not because we want to give lands to anyone
Thank you
The sad thing is he puts the whole population in a miserable situation and people know they are in a shitty situation but he also gives them hope that there are better days to come and blames the shittines on the opposing parties and Gülen (who he befriended in the first place btw)
This is the Orwellian shit we are going through, and people don’t know they are in a populistic scheme, they barely know how to wash their asses
Turkish population is very old like only around 23 percent are 18-25, another 23 percent is children not able to vote, and the rest is these fossils who came from a shitty education, abandoning their villages to prosper in the shitty jobs that a large city like İstanbul offers
Atatürk saw that education was a big problem in those villages, he wanted these “villager institutes” to be built and they taught everything from classic literature to mathematics that a modern citizen needed to know
Then came along these landlords saying these institutes were “communistic” and that they were threatening their position, America didn’t help either: they told that if we wanted the aid of bazillions of shitty tin canned food, we needed to shut down those institutes, and so we did
Now the population needs to shed the older generation at least to level the ground with the current regime, I just hope it betters with time, I can’t do anything else
Era of erdo is ending soon but I don't find westerners sincere on willing turks good
They only wish him fall because of his foreign politics, which is not affecting negatively turkish people
As a turkish, I find it hard to share common enthuasiastism in collaboration with european kids
as a Turk yes it is true
Help
His attitude won't survive
The only reason he managed to remain for so long is that he really managed to use Goebbels tactics to the bit .
&#x200B;
But with current youth, he's nothing but a mockery
No exaggeration
Not even a single "Turkey is not Europe" comment, yeaaaaaaaah based
Sadge :(
Pls save me sos
Damn his Hand remind ne Doom fist
It gets even more sad when you learn that every teen adult is working real hard to get the hell out of Turkey
Agree as a Turkish
Turkey never had modern democracy in the first place
My eyes are full of tears after seeing how our beloved European friends caring about wellfare of Turkish people and democracy
Come on guys just don't be subtle
Be direct
Who in Europe gives a damn about democracy in Turkey and Turkish people's wellfare
You were always okay with him as long as it fit you
Our dear democracy protector Macron loves freedom and democracy
That's why he likes and works with Haftar and Sisi
I like European people, I really do
But your hypocrisy and virtue signalling are killing me
Tr de demokrasi mi vardı aq
Our economy is getting worse and worse each year education is a nightmare people are hungry and İ wish i was born in germany ;(
I really want to do this too
Yes, they somehow think that we don’t like him because we want to give lands or something
He uses religion and fucked our economy so young people doesn’t like him but there are people who thinks Islam will be ruined if he is gone so they still vote for him
There are other reasons too but these are the main ones
[oof]
The education system is getting fucked our economy keeps getting worse each day and people are depressed because they can't live their lives like all otjer people do
Why would we want Iran land
Makes no sense
Wanting it for Azerbaijan is more sensible
You mean, Karabakh
I didnt count Americans when spit out "westerners" because of I guess an ordinary american have no clue what is going on in Turkey
Ofc they are westerners as well
But my words look accurate for mediterrenean coasts to scandinavians, at least among the redditers
Everytime I check any post or comment includes the subject of Turkey, I also see hatred towards to Turkish people or Turkey itself
All people would enjoy a chat with me in a bar suddenly becomes a historic enemy in their minds
It is the issue
Btw thanks for the kind feedback
We dislike Iran and Saudi Arabia too, you’re not alone
And I’m happy to hear you like us
Lovely
Üfff reis gökyüzünden dolar yağdıracak Londra'da ezan sesi yükselecek
Yeah there was an earthquake in İzmir and everyone started panicking about the mutation
We already have, find another land piece
Yes, I have been in Incirlik air base once owing to my dad's business
It definetely creates a emotional bridge between americans and turks in Adana, the city where air base is located
Also I lived in there for 10 years
Yeah covid mutation first seen in the UK
People started panicking about it and there are lots of fake news about it
Fascist is not land piece

I loved their outfits
As a Turk living in Turkey i am just wondering if we sent only our douches to Western Europe or we sent normal people and they became douches there
Immigrants tend to be more rude, more radical and more big-headed and more bigoted than Turkey Turks
Propaganda is the essence of politics
You can't avoid it
Looks like the flag of some dystopic government set in a sci-fi movie
Flag of Imperalists
Totally agree about GDP, Turkish GDP is increasing but it's totally because things got way more expensive
Yes but your own happiness isn't the most important thing in the world
It's easier to escape and harder to work on correcting what is bothering you
And only people who are willing to do the hard work are able to change things for everyone, not only for their unimportant selves
Germany : *_i'm safe_*
I thought we had street view EVERYWHERE in turkey, but seeing the western Europe having much more feels ridiculous to me
Germany, Austria and Turkey has partial street views
I sense something in here
In turkey 120 km/h means drive 132 km/h
10% so I guess the actual limit in Cyprus is 120 km/h. Does the police give you trouble if you drive with 120 km/h ?
Preparing foe the long sleep
Malta aint much bigger than Luxemburg either
Wonder why it's never included
Oh, I'm blind
I don't think they are oppressed victims, I just say they have the right to self-determination
Sorry I made an ignorant comment
So what do you think about Kurds in Turkey and the Middle East
Weird
The right to self-determination is the natural right of every people
Whether a people is cruel or oppressed, the right to self-determination cannot be usurped
The Kingdom of England usurp the Scots 'right to self-determination, just as Turkey usurp the Kurds' right to self-determination
I support the idea of ​​an independent Kurdistan
>All I remember is that turkey was fighting the Kurds who were fighting Assad and Isis
I don't know much about their culture and where their historic land is but it seems as if turkey is trying to prevent them breaking off Turkish territory
Yes, Turkey organized military operations in northern Syria (Rojava) to support Assad and the Ba'ath Party
Another purpose of these operations was ethnic cleansing
Führer explains why Kurds should be [killed]
>''Erdogan: The important thing is to keep such a region under control and to work in a controlled way, and Arabs should live in this region because the Kurds are not suitable for living in this geography
>Announcer: Why
>Erdogan: Because these are desert regions
This is all Erdogan's knowledge of anthropology:Arabs live in the desert, Kurds live in the mountains
An example of what was done to Kurds in Turkey is what happened in [Diyarbakır prison
>32 women who remained in Diyarbakır prison in those years;
* "We were subjected to all kinds of torture, including electricity, but the worst was sexual torture
* "They took the women they raped to the ward with their bloody skirts
* "They put the skirts on our heads, they strip us, they say 'travel'."
* "They came out of the bathroom in a robe and masturbated while looking at us
* "The biggest torture was listening to the screams of other women
* "They forced the women to drink their sewers
The Republic of Turkey is the home of racism and fascism btw kemalism
We must support the Kurdish people who are exposed to this fascism
As someone who knows the history of the Ottoman and the Republic, I say that;
Erdogan = Ataturk + Abdul Hamid II
I hate him and his idols too
All right SÖR.
Okay what the fuck is wrong with Hungary here
I like this drink, whats it called
beer, bier, biere, bierra cervesa, cerveza, cervexa
ah yes good ol garagardoa
Lol öl means die in Turkish
South half of Cyprus:
Ölme
And thats why we love you
Turkey speaks a Turkic Language which is originated all the way from Altai Mountains near modern day Mongolia
And they had the grace to call it bira as god intended
Here's a trivia then: sıra means ''turn'' in Turkish
Weird
Some people are just cruel, man
Did you just forget the glorious kingdom of S E A L A N D?
[It remind me this]
It was because of a political problem that was happened in 2017
I don't remember why it was happened but some pro erdogan fans protest it by squishing oranges and drinking juice lol
Yeah, it's abnormaly cold in Turkey, too
Almost 10 degrees below normal spring temperatures
There was snow in Thessaly, Greece yesterday
It's bizarre to see people who refuse climate change is real, even now
So norway is going to be world's new northern pole
It's so sad to see always poor people suffer from wars
Ofc I have never seen someone rich fighting in front line
As a Turk you should never say such thing as it proves that you have no clue about your own history
Turks lost almost all of their shining generations, from rich to poor, educated to business people during and post WW1
It still stands as one of the main reason why we’re not developed country since it left us only nomadic / village population left in our countryside
No university students, no professors, no good business people, no high elite left due to wars, migrations and political conflicts caused by the war itself
When I said that I remembered our fallen soldiers history againts PKK
The fallens are mostly from villages with poor/non educated places
Ofc they are joining the army for money because he can't find job elsewhere
Like it is his last hope
Not every sergeant die but I hear in news once or more each week
I've stopped even folowing military news long ago
Dunno how it is now
I agree both are unnecessary but uncircumcised dick looks ugly
I mean everybody get circumcised here but still every guy horny as fuck
I don't think it is a serious sensitivity lost
Is this mean uncircumcised guys reach orgasm sooner because more nerve more sexual pleasure
Or they only have greater orgasm than circumcised guys
ah yes
Forza horizon 4
Wow forza horizon 4 is a reality

I hope we don't have to make same folders for Kurdistan :p

In that case I hope they try something radically different than the typical parliamentary or presidential system

The difference between a patriot and a traitor is whether or not they win the war
I'm not from EU but congrats
Very well deserved Catalans
*grabs popcorn*
STRONG CATALONIA
In the moment every revolution seems like it was started by madmen
If the Catalonians can kill more Madrdians then they will have true independence
The only recognition you will get is from occupied territories or countries that just really hate Spain
What happens when the Spanish government stops receiving money from the northeast of Spain
If the Catalans truly view themselves as independence why do their taxes go to someone else
All the businesses, accountants and personal accounts of Catalans would redirect their payments to "Barcelona" or whatever they choose to be the new seat of government
This is how you cripple your former nation if you're vying for independence
Madrid can't send in the troops to beat you down if they can't pay them with your money
This is all dependent on you being the economic engine of said former country though
Romania be like: nonononoyes
â, û and î not in [Turkish Alphabet] but in some words like hâlâ, hükûmet and dinî . Idk why they arent adding that letters in official Turkish alphabet
Lol "qırımtatar tili" literally translates to "Crimean Tatar Language" whereas there is a literal "Tatarça" which looks the more appropriate way to name an language, I wonder why they did not just name it "qırımtatarça" or something like that
But if it continues after saying no, ain't it harrasment
I really do wonder that too
Those letters are clearly needed yet not official

LoL Smyrna
Virtue signaled whataboutism, gibs me my upvotes :D
You are pathetic
I recognize the genocide, but what’s the point of this shit you posted
You wanna be European so bad you inherited their imaginary moral high horse
Smyrna flair, LMAO
Keep jacking off to their little gestures as they continue to exploit half the fucking world
I am irritated by people always commenting based on a person's flair
You guys have to open your minds to the fact people are individuals and you don't have to escalate discussions into these little digs based on stereotypes or based on national policy which individual humans have no control over
I personally don't deny the genocide, you could probably have inferred that based on my comment and so there was no need for you to bring it up and just become another robot that brings up the Armenian Genocide whenever a Turk shares their opinion online
I didn't wish to go down this rabbit hole, but you've roused me
>It's not just the Armenians
Greeks, Assyrians, Kurdish etc
Turkey used to be a pretty diverse country
I am aware of this of course
But pray tell me this, are you aware that each Balkan country and each Caucasus country used to be similarly pretty diverse countries
Every single post-Ottoman State purified their borders in this same way as Turkey did, during the process of and after gaining independence
All were formerly diverse lands that were homogenised by killings, exiles and forced assimilations due to nationalistic and racist fervour during the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire and rise of Nationalism in each new ethnostate
It's why the ratio of Turks and other language speaking Muslims in the Balkans and Caucasus is far less than it was in Ottoman times, it's why the ratio of Christians and Jews in Turkey is far less than it was in Ottoman times
It's not only conflict between religions, even within religions the Christians did this to each other as well and their current lands have less diversity of Christian ethnic groups than they did in Ottoman Times
the land now called Greece had more Slavic speaking Christians in Ottoman Times and the Slavic speaking countries had more Greek speaking Christians in Ottoman Times than they do now
Jews are far less in number across all forementioned lands as well
My beef as a Turk is why we never talk about the "Ethnic cleansing and genocides that occured during the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire" and why the topic is always centered around putting Turks into a corner to admit the Armenian genocide
It's never felt right to me considering the aforementioned history
>Do you judge your fellow Turks the same way you judge foreign genocide deniers, and foreign genociding leaders
Turks don't deny the genocide at an individual level, it's a governmental political position of semantics
Government doesn't even deny the genocide happened, they just have a particular problem with that word
If the subject could be reframed as "Ethnic cleansing and genocides that occured during the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire" I have no doubt Turkey would readily admit it and use the word
>The people who committed the Armenian genocide are like national heroes in Turkey
This is not true
Ah yes Armenia, Europe
Now that, is some good example of a settlement
Well, technically it's just Eurasia anyway
In Orkhon Inscriptions, the Turkish Khaghan Bilga from about 6th century had written that even though he was inclined to convert to Budism, his second in command, Tonyukuk   warned him that China is relentless, allowing themselves to be too reliant to the Chinese will cause long term subordination and they shouldn't be tricked by short-term gains
It's not the same thing maybe, but it still ads-up with today's situation
China is not to be trifled with, they're basically taking over countries via infrastructure deals
Good idea from turkey
Wow

Don't give illiterate ignorant stupid peasants right to vote and expect them to make rational decisions
Democracy is an idealist and overly-optimist concept
You know that they put crap ton of fake YES votes then goverment made them legalright

It's not like red cities are empty deserts

What happened
turkey bad now give upvote
8 hours this post stood up and its from a very obvious agenda pushing account that's supposedly against r/europe's rules
I am sure people  reported it to mods yet its been around for almost a whole day
>No agenda pushing: Refers to accounts which persistently post or comment on one topic and/or attempt to derail normal conversations in order to support their agenda
This rule will be applied especially strictly for new accounts
/r/Europe isn't an outlet for propaganda
What is going on here
Here is a funfact; my mother worked as a Nurse in a Kurdish town in 1980s, when so-called Kurdish independence fighters raided the city, they killed every single person
Even the dogs and sheep
"Ethnic cleansing" towards a terrorist organisation
Good
I am looking forward for it
It's not about Erdoğan at all
Turkey has been suffering from terrorism for decades and when we stop fighting them, they get stronger and explode themselves in our city centers, killing civilians
Even after Erdoğan Turkey won't stop
Keep believing every single propaganda terrorists perform on the Internet but it won't change the reality
No one can do anything about it
As an Erdoğan hater I say that
Lmao the shit people upvote in this sub
It's amazing to me that in this day and age; where we understand that discriminating people based on their skin color or their sexual orientation is wrong, there's this comment section which people discriminate other people based on their **leader**. People are not their leaders
People are not their government
Democracy can not ensure 1 on 1 societal representation
We can't assume all Americans are crooked or all New Zealanders are compassionate because of Donald Trump or Jacinda Ardern
We can't hold up bigoted and ignorant beliefs like "if you visit Turkey you're supporting Erdoğan". We have to go meet all peoples, talk to all peoples and engage with all peoples in this beautiful age of global travel & communications
Top-to-bottom bigotry and isolation will only perpetuate the problem and make more Erdoğan supporters out of the moderate people
Another bullshit fake news about turkey
PKK is a terrorist organisation which do things like Kidnapping, Woman Trade, Slavery, Drug Trade etc
They are an actual terrorist organisation and no we are not attacking Barzani (Leader of Kurdistan) we are attacking PKK and its not ethnic cleansing if that were the case Police would attack kurds in Ankara, İstanbul, Antalya, İzmir etc
Ethnic cleansing
Wtf when was killing terrorists become ethnic cleansing
Why am I not surprised to see this shit every day
I am in Turkey rigth now and I can't see anyone dying
I only can see Kurds having extra rights and priviliges for being a minority
a misleading title with propaganda
this is not about Erdogan
I don't like Erdogan at all but this is a propaganda against Turkey by terrorists
Turkey didn't bomb those places because Kurds live there
There are 18 millions Kurdish people live in Turkey
no one bombs them
Turkey bombs terrorist hideouts
and you people contributing this propaganda which means you are helping terrorist who uses suicide bombers to kill civilians including children
its hard for you to understand because it doesn't happen to you
when you guys outraged by ISIS using suicide bombers and you guys supported your armies bombing ISIS hideouts
its basically same thing
PKK is a terrorist organization
It doesn't matter what they fight for
They kill innocent people, children, teachers, ambush ambulances
This isn't a reliable news source, you are just an anti-turk
Look at that person's profile it's full of fake bullshit news about Turkey
turkey bad, give me upvote
What about israel ? no one gives a shit about this country they are act like douche
Why this sub never say anything about israel's behavior
it doesnt suprise me at all that seems like something erdoğan would do
I dispise this man
He's one of the great aggrevators of tension in especially Syria for years now
But the ''kurdish existence'' this article speaks of is actually an insurgency, recognised as a terrorist organization by US and UN
If they were attempting to make a cleansing, they'd to it in Southeastern towns, where majority are kurdish
Turkey is committing some crimes in the Middle East, I can say
This, is not one of them
So stop bullshitting folks
Russia once published footages of his son-in-law smuggling oil from ISIS territories
Focus on that, that is a real crime
Be that it's a bit old now
Europe, what an easy target for propaganda
They have money, they don't know a single thing about middle East, they hate Turks
Well drop a donation link to them so they can buy you some bombs
Armenian genocide now give upvote
It's the UAE and its because of Erdogan, Qatar and Libya

[THANK YOU
This basically sums up my whole life of commenting on articles about Turkey on the Anglosphere internet
Based
Keep using such heavy words for shit like this and they'll stop meaning what they used to mean
I think the difference is that Europeans, in our modern time, are synonymous with and prided upon their progressive values
So it's always ironic that on a forum that is about Pan-European identity, an identity shaped by aforementioned progressive values, that people display such toxic non-progressive behaviour
It's like they've totally misunderstood what the underlying logic and solidarity behind Pan-European identity is all about
Because of this, Europeans are held to a higher standard than other peoples
Its Turkey, its a nice way of referring to Turkey in a sarcastic comment
To enhance the sarcasm of the comment, i could have said kebab country as well but I didn't
There is no reason, no reference or anything
Just sarcasm and silliness
Seriously there is no reference or anything its just a cheap wordplay
Because its a wordplay from English
Because [Turkey the bird] and [Turkey the country] dude you are way too overthinking
Ow France
The city of freedom, passion, love
Why all the roofs have flues
Seems weird to me
That's just a propaganda
Incredibly skeptical
If such thing happened Russian radars would have probably picked the position of this claimed Turkish F-16 over Armenia
Russia has a base in Armenia after all
And listing sources that only reports the claims of Armenia aren't "sources" on whether this happened or not
This is a fake news
Armenia always do same thing there are no reliable news about that or news source
This is still not confirmed after so many hours
Any update on this
Armenians and greeks strongly believe the jet shut down, turks and azeris strongly believe it is not, so it is a belief issue
I go with do not believe
Any proof
You guys were right, should have not called it fake news and got lots of downvotes for no reason
Here is the proof that Turkey shot down the alleged armenian jet
&#x200B;
Lies
Many hours passed still no confirmation has come
It's very clear this claim isn't true but people are still discussing like it really happened, pretty stupid
I feel like one day Turkey will really shot down one plane and nobody will believe it like that shepard boy story
Its fake news guys
Propaganda
news from armenian propaganda machine they really want to pull russia on their side but they dont know if russia join the party thinks get worse beucuse turkey iran and israel is allready in caucas if russia involve thats mean america involve too
i call bullshit
wasn't us
Fake news
USSR should’ve just said it is Armenian land instead of Azerbaijani in 1980’s...
Still waiting for more news
And still waiting a not proven flair
This kind of claims just further damage everything
Unfortunately mod team is sleeping on this
Armenia occupying a foreign country territory and kill people
who is the lunatic
Finally, someone with a common sense
There is no such thing as fellow Christians when it comes to politics of nations
What do you think this is 1300s or something
Us secular turks stand with you guys
did we ask tho
If you wanna stand with them so much
You can join them, they'll give you an ak47
But you need to hurry cus your Armenian bruuthers are getting wiped out right now
Nooo
Ermenians fucked up army can beat worlds 8th most powerful army nooooo /s
What about the Armenian propaganda machine
My ass
It'll not believe me
Our mighty leader's ego would be wounded
We're able to defend ourself
Thank you for your kind wish that would end up killing my people if it happens
I too hope that one of the largest armies in the world bomb my country and possibly kill the people i love because of the actions of one insane guy
Καλημερα, neighbor
just like the way we're gonna throw you malakas to aegean
> I hope Russia will hit the Turks
Keep dreaming
lol
Yes now We're out of nato cus an idiot Canadian man said so
At the end of the day, We belong to the west
Our relationship with Russia is nothing more than strategic
nato is basically free defence for turkey at this point with no return
Funfact: Turks have a huge drone industury which can destroy Armenian forces in hours (which is showcased in Syrian civil war), therefore no one would risk their pilots lives to shoot down just one plane
If Turkey wanted to participate in that war, it would destroy infastructure and land forces of the Armenians by using drones, not risking their planes and soldiers in dog fights
&#x200B;
Armenians are trying to play "victims" while actively invading Azerbaijani land
Lmao
isnt a proxy war 2 states supporting opposing sides in a rebellion
The unsourced fake news are at it again
İt was ottomans  , i have accepted the Armenian genocide as a Turk but this comment is bullshit
Turkey didn't do that this post is unsourced
aren't you late to rake your forests ? Fuck off
ah yes the spokeperson
I understand Greece and Armenia but why you too
they're taking what's theirs
Now downvote me mothafuckas
You must be pretty stupid to put religion first before your interests
You just cover-up the ugly side of things by using religion such as "how much will I gain from this and what am I going t lose in return"
Same with using Christianity or Islam
**Usa would like to talk to you**
We can't do shit to Russia, believe me, .If they hold the tourist from coming to us
We're fucked
It was one of the worst years for our country when we shot down the Russian jet
are you like the embassador of bulgaria because you act like you do but in fact you are just some rando on the internet
Edit:r
Nah, I think we will be fine with Bulgaria
Not towards Bulgaria
It's pretty positive when it comes to them actually
I'd argue Russia had no intention to take over Ukraine in the first place
They got Crimea and secured their port
They cut Donbass from the rest of the country, giving them an open wound that will keep bleeding and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO at the same time
There is no point in trying to invade an entire country which also happens to be one of the biggest in Europe in terms of landmass
Too much territory to hold onto with a hostile population you need to deal with
Makes absolutely no sense at all from Russian perspective
Similarly with Turkey, I don't even think it will lead to a hot conflict between our countries but even if it does, I'm perfectly sure Turkish borders would remain intact
We don't even share a land border with Russia, it's not like they'll roll the tanks in and try to occupy our land
"I am going to fight for my religion," said no one whatsoever
And religion doesn't tip the scales
People use it as a cover to make them feel better
I dunno, Armenia warned about this specifically yesterday, and now they claim this with no further proof
Seems fishy to me
You said your money was on russia i said that because usa won't like that it isn't so funny and by the way Armenia first attacked
In my opinion Bulgaria won't risk a conflict with a major trade partner
I didn't expect them to like us, i just stated that Turkey does not act hostile towards Bulgaria
Btw lucikly reddit users don't rule their countries, as Bulgaria is friendly with Turkey in real life
Like that's not what they have been doing since the Soviet Union days
Those AK's, Iglas and Atgm's doesn't grow on trees
Well I'm not actually sure about AK's but rest definitely doesn't.
I see this comment here and there many times to arm Kurds but practically they’re being armed for almost 50 years already by many countries
What you guys think of Turkey and Kurds
There are like millions of Kurds waiting to be armed in Turkey so they can cause civil war
This is not Syria
Turkey won the battles against Pkk long ago within its borders and its done deal
There is nobody left to arm, they are all gone to Syria and became YPG, an organization that Turkey started war couple years ago and pushed from its borders again
So again, it’s done deal
The maximum Russians can do provide manpads to YPG and hope downing of more Turkish jets, which Turkey will eventually make more offensives and take more cities within Syria
Even if you’re America, you can’t beat a country mobilizing army in its backyard unless you openly war with them
Can Russia war against Turkey on Turkish border
Yes they can
But they can’t project their full power regarding logistical issues while Turkey can fly over the Syrian skies easily considering the amount of airbases in Turkey
Erdogan does not trust NATO, he knows he is a regional power and whole this shitshow is happening on the region he is the most powerful
That’s the reason of his flex
Ottoman empire is really god example when it comes to how religion is used as cover up
Biggest example is Mehmet the second
And when it comes to Christianty, we saw how Chatolics sacked the İstanbul
They were their religion brothers, I wonder were they thinking the same thing when they were counting the Ortodox golds
I don't know about them being stationed there but this isn't a proof, not even remotely
They often participate in combat excercises with Azerbaijani pilots
This means nothing
Why would we start a conflict with bulgaria
Look at all the places where cocks will be drawn
Your country is run by PiS lol why do you sound like Poland is living in 2100 and Romania is a shithole
Somebody map this in assetto corsa or something
RIP USSR
This looks extremely arbitrary like Baltics central Europe
what
[Fixed it
So Cyprus is in Europe while having a 700km sea between it and mainland Europe, but a stair keeps Turkey out of Europe
How conveniently it includes Cyprus
Cyprus, Malta, Chios, Rhodos and Lesbos aren't part of Europe geographically
Even Lombardia would fit quite well
Hey I ride a bike in Istanbul, and I don't feel like people are trying to kill me, at least, not compared to when I was biking in Chicago
I'm shocked at how much space people in Istanbul give me
Istanbul's roads are narrow and rhere's nowhere to go,but people give me space
Chicago's roads are crazy wide with lots of space to pass, but people were aiming for me there
I was surprised, I thought I'd run into psychopaths a lot
So far I've only run into idiots, and that doesn't bother me so much
Idiots are idiots, they don't pay attention, psychopaths are aiming for you, and I haven't yet experienced that in Istanbul, while it was a near daily occurance in Chicago
I'm honestly amazed, because I really did think Istanbul would have more psychopaths than Chicago
Idiots are predictable, so they're not really a problem, IMO
To be fair though, even my car driving style fits in perfectly in Istanbul, so I guess I've been ready for driving/biking in the city my whole life :P Now that I live there its just perfect for me
I always wish there were less idiots, but I got used to 50% idiots, 2% psychopaths, and 48% OK Drivers in Chicago, and, well, it takes a lot to phase me now
the 10% idiots, .01% psychopaths, and 89
99% OK drivers in Istanbul is a pretty big upgrade for me
And on top of that, in Chicago I spent half my time on paths off of city streets, and it was still miserable overall
Not enough to stop me from biking because its really good for me and a lot of fun, but GOD DAMN are chicago's drivers fucking crazy
Have you ever driven in the U.S.? Compared to the U.S., Istanbul is paradise, and the traffic death rates reflect that
Istanbul is 1/100K, the Safest U.S. City is 3,4/100K, Chicago is 5,5/100K U.S. Average is 10,5/100K Turkey average is 8,7/100K IIRC
WAS THIS ALSO PART OF YOUR PLAN, JOJO
"W-Was this also part of your plan, Joseph
Lol India is one of the richest nation on earth lmfao
>Dutch and Danish standards of living are way better than French or British
That's what happen when you're a small country
It's not even important who is richer than who, all of that is  irrelevant lmfao
France, Danemark and The Netherlands and the UK are four countries with a overhaul small populations
Most of the peple born in those countries can be freacking delighted that they weren't born in some unknown shithole deep in Russia or India
Standards of live can still improve but many European are too focus on themselves and are not able to look around them
> Switzerland than Pennsylvania
What in hell is this logic
> Population doesn't make for a good country
>it was about the fact that 40% of the population still shits in the open because they don't have toilets or won't use toilets
Ok dude
Haha nice job Turkey, keep it up
Doing amazingly there not closing down one of the biggest cities in the world
Oh yeah, totally Erdo-boy let's fucking pray the sickness away, there you go
You don't have to pretend like you care of Turkey
The health system in Turkey is on top 3 in Europe
Btw i'm really worried about Germany
The death rate has been increasing rapidly in [Germany
At] the first,they were testing teens generally,(approximately like %90)
And now they are testing old people and the old people in Germany are dying in pain
Truths hurt
I Like Orange color tint
Lol not surprised
To be honest, people in Turkey subreddit were pointed out the fact that AK Trolls(people who pushes AKP or Erdogan Propaganda) has taken over the subreddit couple months ago
If so gaining popularity in that subreddit may result one person who has government connection to check the subreddit
This shows the why it is high due to there were anti-AKP posts
Didn't even know that the government was aware of Reddit
Not suprised at all
Remove kebab but it is reverse
Lmao, as a Turkish citizen, I expected that
duuude
delet this
I'm Turkish but I've never heard of someone who wants to remove content from reddit
İts probably not from the government
I honestly doubt that the idiots ruling us know about Reddit .
Well, there is anti Russia and anti Turkey posts at least 10 times more than the whole list combined as well
Edit: So nice people are here fanatics even downvote post stating facts
I bet its actually probably more to do with the Syrian conflict
Or maybe it's the kUrDiSh GeNoCiDe
I have seen more pics of French and British Protestors than post criticising Turkey, at least those which reach the frontpage
The whole "Armenian thing" shows how invested and studied in the subject .
It is for porn
Some can argue the opposite bloc is more deserving or rather equally deserving the same criticism
Those are temporary, the criticism Russia and Turkey get is constant
People love to create enemies in their brains and unite against it
Saudi Arabia is 1000 worse than any of the two regarding democracy and posing potential threat to lives of Europeans, but it’s a weak country that pays a lot to Europe, so we see Putin bad, Erdo bad posts 1000 times more
As in the government is requesting porn be taken down on Reddit
[The Reddit admin spez said "Most likely porn"]
Yes, I mean, they shutdown every fucking porn site with URL filtering
Why not request it aswell
Let’s constantly post genocides Europe, Canada, America committed and try to get these countries punished with the discourse, and let’s praise Isis equally just as we do for YPG and let’s talk about puppet regimes Americans are installing by sabotaging countries instead of Putin’s imperialistic dreams and see the results
But if it’s gonna make you more happy and moral high person, let’s not discuss
All those countries listed are angels, Putin is evil, Erdogan is sultan wannabe
Thanks god we have European countries uphold our perfect free lives
Ahhh so they were requesting full subreddits to be blocked
That's interesting
I guess if they can't get it all with imgur and url bans they have to go after the actual subs too
So weird

''Respect my religion that calls you infidels dogs and animals, or I'll kill you because I'm a follower of everything that're holy
What I wonder, how can someone get to this point in his mind
Like, there are a lot of things I just hate, but deciding to kill a random guy as a response is like, what the fuck
As a Turk, I am with France
Fucking cunts are gonna result in Islam being hated even more by the west and thats gonna result in major govt support
DONT G I V E  U P
Hey man, a Turk here
Our relations might not be the best for now, but it doesn't really matter
I wish you and your country best of the luck
I know you all are strong enough to overcome this tough times
Stay safe
They did that after 2 turkish descendent citizen get attack by Armenian protesters
(I don't remember at which country it happened
But it was an European one)
Stop acting like they're just having their daily routine
Bad guess as that event was a response protest agaist beatings of Azeris in an Armenian rally
It was a demonstration to taunt Armenians who did the beating
There is a reason that group literally didn't beat anybody just marched on street
Erdoğan literally has zero reletion with terrorism in europe lol Millions of Turks live there and they don't knife people over religion
Lots of Turks in Europe worship him he can say attack tomorrow and they will but he never done that
Erdoğan's method for dealing insults is suing with his army of lawyers
He just sued Geert Wilders for that reason he proably will do the same with charlie hebdo
Unless the guy is confirmed to be Turkish this comment is massive misunderstanding of the situation in France
Arabs don't really hold Erdoğan as leader of muslims
How is the Nagorno Karabakh war, which is a territorial dispute in which Armenia is officially and internationally recognized as foreign occupiers, related to Islamic terrorism in Europe
Your propaganda driven mentality wants other people to join you in your crusade but France is France
Russia is also Europe, so as Turkey, and Portugal, and Belarus
Stop trying to make it look like there is a race or culture called European
Ahval is anti Turkey newspaper is being funded by America exiled Turkish coup platter Fetullah Gulen, and to claim protesting people are in search of Armenians to kill is just utmost bullshit propaganda
How would a sane person eat this shit
Believe that over hundred people woman and man are searching for a race to kill, where its known Turkish people are not known with terrorism acts
And person who brought this bullshit here is a Greek, even trying to connect such sad event to their classical Turkish hatred to gain political points
I want him gone
But I don’t want him to become a martyr because that’d make things worse
Now imagine this guy fucks your country and you can't even run away
Maybe I am naive but I never understood why Europeans cared so mcuh about Erdoğan
If I lived in Germany I would just turn my head away and keep living in peace
Or rather I would maybe question my own country for having millions of Erdobots
isnt far right growing in europe as a whole
OK, so do you believe it is more plausible that this attack happened because of Erdogan or because of further publishing of Charlie Hebdo cartoons, which was the previous reason for previous attacks as well
Edit: lol at Turkey calling for persecution of Armenians
What world do you live in
You’re right, but if you want to fact check me, you can find many anti-Erdogan democratic pro western people bash Ahval news and refuse to work there
Gulen did not flee coz of Erdogan, he fled our secular regime back then when Erdogan wasn’t even a name
It’s hard to imagine
But all my life I’ve had Erdogan’s party holding power
And I guess I’m not hopeful anymore
I just fail to see things getting better after years of it getting worse, but maybe that’s just the failure of my imagination
Because after all, even if Erdogan goes away, all the people who followed him won’t.
Do you realize not many Muslims or Arabs (which are mostly the attackers in these attacks) follow or like Erdogan
Erdogan only speaks tough like that for his own Muslim followers in Turkey
I highly doubt he has any influence on non-Turks in Europe as almost every Arab I've met in Europe hates him
> by killing Kurds and Armenians
Can you provide examples please
There is no national pride in killing anyone, this is a myth, a lie and ignorant
You're spreading lies about people
People tend to give this organization that much credit, just another Turkey topic
But it’s actually much more deeper than it seems
His house is protected by CIA, the assassinator of Russian Ambassador to Turkey was graduated from his schools and his family was members of this organization
They have lots of schools all around Europe and Africa, he has pictures with pope
They bought lots of officials in American senate and in other countries, I think their idea was to reach places Vatican can not in terms of political influence via religion
(as there are huge masses you can control that way) Erdogan benefitted from them as a vote bloc until they tried to overthrow him
And then the witch hunt started
Overall, for a common person its good news
Evil elephants destroy each other and we ants are not harmed
:) One way or another, Erdogan is purging extreme islamists like illuminati mindset from our state and hunts them globally, and they hunt his reputation back
Win/win
By the way, to let you understand the extend of this organization, 6 months ago 2 flight dispatch in a Turkish airline company got fired, and they disappeared within half an hour, all social medias and such
Turned out they were recording whole office talks but forgot 700 gb recording on the office laptop accidentally, they were asking office people whether they like Erdogan or not, or if coup was staged, to further blackmail them to take them in or replace them with another gulenist person
In the recording you can hear them talking about my brother, nah this one is hard to break, he is not talking about politics at all etc etc
So many years past since coup, but they are still all around in every high ranking position
Still makes me afraid like a horror movie
Just look at these dicks
They think he’s a demigod
> He launched military campaign in Syria where Turkish army mercilessly killed a bunch of Kurds
Are you kidding me
The Kurds you are talking about are members of the YPG, which are the Syrian wing of the Kurdish PKK
They are recognized as terrorists by several NATO nations including the United States
The campaign against the YPG was to secure the Turkish-Syrian border against the YPG
Russia only stepped in after Turkey attacked Assad's forces, not the YPG
Even Lindsey Graham, the fiercest critic of Turkey's involvement in Syria, admitted this:
So can you please stop spreading false information and propaganda
> we are witnesses of increasing number of attack on Armenians
Hate crimes happen on both sides
(which you didn't mention) Needless to say they need to stop from both sides
> They might hate him, but he is giving them justification and encouragement with its statements
No, this is just a huge reach
What's giving them the encouragement is the French people standing up
It has nothing to do with Erdogan
Edit: All political parties, including Erdogans opposition and 90% of the Turkish population supported the Syrian operations
> They would say anything that is in their interest
It's not in his interest as Graham is a fierce critic of Turkey as I said
Graham was the one who called all sorts of sanctions on Turkey, may I remind you
How much longer are you gonna deny the truth
At this point, it seems you will just disregard any evidence I post
> We can see with our own eyes how the conflict in Armenia is unraveling
Yes, the occupying Armenian army is losing ground and Turkey and Israel are supporting Azerbaijan to let them do so
You must've forgot we are allies with Azerbaijan
> about Turkeys army in Syria
Well clearly you're reading from some BS media, friend, because nothing you said so far is true
We in Yurop
But now we broke :(

Cities:Sylines
Killing the soul of a city with a great history for the sake of profit is not what I'd call "intense development" but that's not my business
In today's world, skyscrapers are surely needed in some of bigger cities but I think their number should be limited and they need to be built in a way that doesn't harm the overall harmony of the cityscape
Otherwise, as in the case with Wola, it looks very depressing and sad
Who looks at this photo and feels positive, honestly
What is there to like in this
Using cards benefits banks at cost of small business profits
They get a cut on every purchase + they get to lend you money
Also try to go a month without card
You'll likely spend less
Because cards remove association of money with a limited resource
I'm not a fan of cash either
Ideally we should all use debit card like stuff but it should be much more transparent
Sad thing then polish people are still living quite a shitty life
> I do
I love looking outside my bedroom window, and seeing how those skyscrapers in distance are getting taller and taller every day
Feels really uplifting
I can't blame you
Brain damage and full-fledged love for Americanization is a common occurrence in eastern & central European countries which were subjected to Nazi and communist regimes in the span of a relatively short time
Going from one extreme to the other, I guess
I mean not as good then in Netherlands, France or UK
> Because seeing such a striking proof that things are getting better in a place that used to be filled with misery and post-industrial ruins not so long ago, and finding it depressing and sad is a pretty strong indication of that
All I'm saying is skyscrapers kill the soul of cities and they look fucking ugly
This is why I find it depressing and see no correlation between development and skyscrapers
A city can be very well-developed and great in anything without having them, you know
If skyscrapers were a sign of development, believe me, Istanbul would be the best place in the world to live
This new DLC is great
So when they cops "get theirs" they go back to beating down their fellow countrymen in exchange for the rich man's money
The protesters are just a leveraging tool to the police
You guys sure ain't biased
It's so fucking stupid i couldn't even believe the news
I feel so embarassed to other countries because of what this stupid ignorrant man did
And i also want to say that Erdoğan is an shameless dictator for even playing those videos in a rally
As a Turk I'm very sorry for Dutch folks, my prayers go out to you all
Fascism, racism, ignorance and radicalism are the things we have to fight against together, no matter what religion you believe in
P.S: it's said that this terrorist joined a fight in Chechnya and also he's been arrested in Netherlands due to Isis connections but released after a while
I’m surprised
Turks usually don’t commit terror attacks in Europe
Sorry Netherlands
I think this was the last terrorist attack happening in Europe so far
This is in BBC Turkish
Claim given by a Turkish businessman who lives in Utrecht, it still needs a confirmation tho
“Counter-terrorism police reportedly say the shooting "appears to be a terrorist attack".
I only assumed terrorism because of this
It might be wrong though
Vote by darts
Are those
trash bins
> How to irritate **Europeans** with one sentence
> Has Turkey on the map
This will irritate enough people by itself lol
Anyway, there are a lot of things that can trigger Turks
The suggestion that Arabs=Turks is a good one
Most Turks look down upon Arabs and don't like being associated with them
Other quality trolling questions: "I bet you can't drink alcohol in Turkey", (if victim is female +not wearing a headscarf) "You must feel so free here in Europe, you have to wear that headscarf thing whenever you are outside in Turkey"
Suggesting that a Turkish food is actually not a Turkish food but is a Greek/Bulgarian/Serbian/whatever food will also draw angry comments
After a bit of shitstorm someone rational will point out that these countries shared common history under Ottoman Empire so similarities in culinary are to be expected, this answer satisfies the Turks but tends to trigger Greeks/Bulgarians/Serbians/Whatevers this time
Suggesting that Turks still ride camels and most of Turkey is desert is a good trolling method
I've seen people believing the latter a lot so if anyone is wondering, no, there are no deserts in Turkey
Making overused jokes and memes such as "Turkey
DAE Thanksgiving
" and "It's nobody's business but the Turks" and "Turkish prison" may force a facepalm but nothing major
edit: I forgot the best one, the word Constantinople doesn't trigger Turks but when foreigners say it by expecting to trigger us, it just annoys us that you think we are that simple
We have more complex things to get angry about, like food, or someone claiming Anatolia is rightful Armenian/Kurdish/Greek clay or something
edit2: Bringing up Armenian Genocide in online discussion to score an automatic debate win
"yeah but you committed a genocide" *upvoted through the stratosphere*
edit3: If you make a "is it safe to visit Turkey
" thread in /r/turkey, they will rape your karma

Wait you guys don't like the first two parts
Those are the best parts though
Yeah just added that a few minutes ago
My god we have such a diverse trigger system
Genocide only triggers me if it's brought up in a whataboutist way
Half the threads that mention Turkey, there is at least one comment from some butthurt person saying "Turkey isn't Europe, this shouldn't be here
Gets annoying quickly
I don't know, people seem to have wildly different opinions about it
As a Turk I don't agree with that but I can see why some would
If by partly you mean Thrace then yes I agree
It would make half the population think better of you and other half want to throw you off a cliff
If that's happening in Europe, it's filled with Erdoğan's fanatics so you are more likely to run into an AKP idiot there
Your country disagrees
A lot of Turkish women wear hijab
We call hijab "türban" by the way
To clear misunderstandings, here are some türban photos so we know what we are talking about [1] [2] But wearing türban is not a requirement or enforced by any kind of law
If you want me to give you a percentage
I really don't know
In one city maybe 80% of women wear it, in another city around 20% does
That black ninja outfit though (still can't remember its' name, covers the face and basically every cm of skin) is very, very rare
It's usually Arab tourists wearing that thing
I think it is around 50-50 contrywide but it varies a lot depending on the place
The only actual Ottoman Turkish name for the city is Dersaadet, which is thought to have given by Rum Mehmed Paşa, who was actually a Greek-turned-muslim so there really is no way around a Greek name
And not just Istanbul , most of our city names have greek roots .
It's true, but the government's standing is more complex than that
I am mostly talking about this subreddit
[Look here] What's photographed is literally European soil but there is some butthurt Greek dude bitching about the post
It's annoying to see a bunch of stupid posts at the bottom of every thread
I must admit, I downloaded you without considering the thread we are in and I'll correct my mistake but you realize my statement is factually correct right
> I guess I misinterpreted what you said to mean women would be triggered by the suggestion they wear the hijab and I got confused
But yeah, suggesting they're "forced" to wear it is a legitimate trigger, so long as people are free wear what they like
When I said "you have to wear that veil thing whenever you are outside in Turkey" it was based on a real event
A friend of mine (who wears no burka niqab türban hijab or whatever
maybe bandana sometimes lol) went to Germany one time and someone literally asked "you are forced to wear a hijab in Turkey aren't you
" while she was drinking beer in a bar
She said she was like "wtf" when she heard that
I should have been clearer
Although yes women who wear it are also triggered at the suggestion that they are forced to wear it (even though they are even if they can't admit it, but that's another story)
It should trigger anyone who is a rational human being
It literally means "that big city". Love the Norse simplicity
> It's annoying to see a bunch of stupid posts at the bottom of every thread
Better than seeing them on top
And by nature stupid posts are supposed to be at the bottom
If they are at top then it's time to leave that sub
Yeah it annoys the crap outta me too but you know if someone doesn't make a comment like that, the thread just feels missing lol
Also, downvoted, not downloaded
But I think that may be excused since it is currently 5 a.m. here
And thats why the cat was vibing
The attraction wouldn't persist if the rest of the world looked like that too
It's not the pre-war architecture that attracts people to New York either
The two cities are just unique, each a package of different things
A better way to think about it is the choices you make in constructing a new public building

If I'm not wrong, Navalny is a far nationalist
If it is true, then that means you support a racist
EDIT: Whattttttttttt
Lots of people have downvoted me, lol
If you don't believe me, just go and check yourself
He once said that people of Caucasia are cockroaches
Also he supports annexation of Crimea
Some people say that Navalny is a far nationalist and racist
Of course not, but the problem is Europe supports a racist, ultra nationalist person agains to Putin
It looks like 1930's. In the begining Europe supported Hitler against to Stalin
Have you noticed that they shit white shit on dark  cars and dark shit on white cars
I think they do it on purpose
I am glad that my country helped to Irish people in the times like these

Legacy of colonialism
Edit: Trying to discredit my points below by mentioning the Armenian genocide or Ottoman conquest of Balkans, which don't concern "me", a Turkish individual *at all*, namely using ad hominems, is essentially conceding that my points are all valid and you can't argue against it
People indulging in usage of ad hominems are just either trying to farm karma by "bird country bad" or taking the crimes their countries committed tens of years ago personally, showing an irrational need to defend a malicious practice either they agree with or they are just so indulged in (toxicated) national pride that they can't see the mistakes of the past
Thanks to all people who actually tried to discuss my points

You cant call it summer if it is below 30 degrees
I quit my job and left Estonia last month
It was like 18-20  degrees and even colder in the evening
Now I am melting in Athens but totally worth it
Meanwhile in Turkey one of the cities got 49 degree
I saw 54 too
What the fuck are these recent attacks
How the hell they can just organise so well in the middle of major EU cities
I saw one guy just shooting a defenseless civilian like he's scratching his back, how the hell can be someone so fucked up by whatever he's believing in
I am not an expert but an attack with automatic weapons and multiple terrorists happens without intelligence service noticing can be only explained as sleeping terrorist cells are ordered to attack
This happened in Turkey before, where IS targeted civilians
Fuck terrorists
The world is going mad
Hope everyone is safe but unfortunately ive heard 7 deaths already :(
Some pathetic losers are trying to frame it on Turks, because civilians in Austrian streets spoke Turkish in a clip
The reality is that 400k+ austrians with Turkish origin live and work in Austria
Some local boxers from Turkish origin helped the police against the terrorists
Mods are you going to take action against these  opportunists
This behaviour only causes more polarization among people on this subreddit
I still have the same question: what was the motive
People say it’s islamist extremists but did they officially say that
This is a quote from 2017, he was pissed because some cities and countries didn't allow him to give propaganda speeches in them
It was especially towards Netherlands If I am not mistaken
I am not his supporter or sth but spreading misinformation in such a critical time is a terrible thing to do
You only spread more hate
Thank you for understanding, and stay strong
He is unfortunately like Putin, we cannot get rid of him :(
> And people wonder why the state of israel has to exist and why they have to take such harsh measures, people forget how many hundreds of millions of people still hate jews simply for being jewish
Israel don't get to be cunts just because there are people who are cunts to Jews
It is cool
There is just way too much misinformation being spread by people so it can fit their own agenda
You have probably got baited by twitter
>Trust me the Islamic Jihad for liberation of Palestine, Hezbollah and IICR of Iran aren't fighting Israel because of Palestinian rights, they are fighting Israel because they hate Jews
Which is a damn shame
Secular movements for Palestinian rights have been diluted by Islamism, same as Kashmiri rights in India and Caucasus peoples rights in Russia
I think this comes off as very wholesome because it shows a humanoid side of people in the past

Why do many radical Muslims hate on the values and cultures of the country they immigrate to
Western Europe needs a stricter immigration policy
Why is it that a lot of the Muslims they let in are the radical ones
The whole system needs a revamping
They need to check how this person and his family got to europe and why they were accepted in the first place
So many western secular Turks getting denied of living in europe then you see people like this living freely there and dare to do something like this
Smh
Islam is a religion and also an ideology
Criticizing it is not racism, not even the slightest
Its a meme to rag on America
but memes just like stereotypes are based on truths
The truth is America kind of sucks
Remember, every empire has had a final day
Some bow out and sail in to the sunset, some collapse under the weight of their own idiocy
A nation's politicians are only a reflection of the worth of its citizens
Stupid liars elect stupid liars

Wow, French really hate Philippe Petain
AFAIK even though siktir is associated with Turkey and is a Turkish word it is also widely used in the Balkans and Transcaucasia
Siktir
"Siktir" is absolutely true by the way
We use it every 5 seconds
Sometimes we call " Hassiktir" but as far as I know it has no meaning :)
From what I can remember, Siktir is also in many other balkan languages
Siktir
My Brazilian friend was using caralho in every sentence

Ja this more possible:)

Americans can keep their nonsense to themselves, I'm annoyed when they push their Americentric beliefs on to rest of the world
They don't know not everything in US applies to everyone else
You need hollywood to make movies about ESA
How about making it as useful and productive as NASA first
Do you have a counterpart to Hollywood
If not, I don't think you can
112 is ambulance in turkey
Our correct number is 112, 911 directs to emergency services (ambulance)

It was 43 degrees here two weeks ago
I feel relieved in 36 degrees heat lmao
Haha no in adana (noth of cyprus) its 37 degrees
Libya is literally heat itself so it got copyright claimed
I'm jealous of all these leaders you guys have doing normal human things
They don't look like nouveau riche creeps at all
Meanwhile we got [this]
This is İzmir, the "capital of secularism" in Turkey
Here is approx
5m people and they're here to see the top opposition president candidate Muharrem İnce
Hope for the good of Turkey
Panoramic view
New videos
I was, and am still there, the crowd here is insane
Never saw something like this in my lifetime, this is insane
In the first time since 2013, we have seen hope, this man will save us from the dictator we all hate
UPDATE: After the meeting, I and many more volunteers cleaned up the square and now, we are drinking beers all together while singing the Izmir anthem, everyone here still hyped up and the atmosphere is amazing
Muharrem İnce promised that if he wins, shortly after the election he's going to start visiting European capitals, try to fix the broken relations with the EU and assign an ambassador to Damascus to repair the relations with Syrian government and take back what Turkey under Erdoğan's regime did in Syria
Just those is enough for me to vote for him
Erdoğan can't win the presidency in first turn, I hope İnce will be able to overthrow him in the second
Also there's a high possibility that Erdoğan and AKP will lose the majority in the parliament
As an undergraduate physics student, I hope a physics teacher will be the president
If is there a chance to make this front page, let’s do it in order to get it seen by everyone
Izmir’s population is 4 Million, and there were almost 3 Million people there
Actually in my opinion, Meral Akşener must beat Muharrem İnce in the first round in order to compete against Erdoğan
Because Akşener is a centre-right politician who may easily affect the votes of rightist Erdoğan while getting the support of the leftists because of their anti-Erdoğanism
According to polls she may get approx
53% of the votes against Erdoğan
But who knows, Muharrem İnce is a strong candidate too and he might give us a surprise
Actually, not the head of his party
We like you too :)
He first entered Parliament in the 2002 elections, with the CHP
Looked notably younger - his hair was more, and was black
Anyway, he was always a proper, well-meaning man, with no (or little) scandals to his name
Always said it straight to the AKP, sometimes raging on the podium as the AKP deputies interrupted him all the time
I've supported him to be the CHP leader ever since 2011-2012
The CHP under Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu has turned
more and more unsavoury, to say the least
So, to summarize: He's a folksy physics teacher entered politics, generally a swell fellow, and he's a bit of a maverick within the CHP: Not immensely leftist, not the staunch Kemalist of the Baykal era, basically the closest Turkey gets to a social democrat
And a damn fine one at that
The elections were to take place in 2019, but with some "pressure" from AKP's ally MHP, (right-wing nationalists) it was decided that it was gonna take place in 2018, next sunday
2019 seems like a normal date but if you can match the dots, you will see that many projects, like high infrastructure investments (including several metro lines in Istanbul) are coincidentally planned to be opened just after 2019
This tactic is a very cheap and overused one and I thought they would use it again
But then hit me
Erdogan surely knows that his opponents are the strongest so far, it's all in
So he probably expects the elections to have a second round
I think that's where they will hit opposition the hardest
It is very suspicious that Erdo (compared to his previous elections) played clean and fairly so far
But in the period between the first and second round, that's when shit will hit the fan
He's going to use his infrastructure projects card, his Terrorism card and he is going to play very dirty
As for ballot countings, I plan to stand in my poll station and stare at the officials counting the votes
I will fight them if they make anything wrong
I hope mr
İnce and ms
Akşener are ready for his future strategy because Turkish youth are tired of the cultist-extremist-islamists holding the power and abusing the hell of it
Also, mr
İnce says he will be in the HQ of Elections Institute with an army of lawyers
I hope he will guard our votes
If Erdo once again tries something as cheap as that cat and transformer stuff, I can only hope that Turkish people are not stupid enough to buy that
HDP expressed their support for the candidate against Erdoğan in the second round
But I would not trust it as Kurdish voters are generally conservative and might actually support Erdoğan
He is, but it depends on what Europe means
Yes, the reforms EU asks of Turkey is pretty good, and they should be done so that the country won’t end up a third world country 20 years from now on, regardless of whether EU wants them or not
But joining the EU
I don’t think Turkey has much to gain from it
Turkish economy is around the size of Spain’s already (last I checked, though Spain has half the number of people, so per capita Spain is still higher)
It might be a political goal, and it’s useful to say X, Y, Z is being done for EU membership
But the real gain is the life quality improvements that come from those changes, and EU is just the carrot
I don’t mind joining EU personally, but with so many Turks, at once I understand the criticism, which is completely fair and valid, but at the same time quite hurt with the vessel that criticism is delivered in, which is, “you’re just not one of us, go back to the Middle East where you rightfully belong you camelf###ers”.
Not only Turkey doesn’t have any deserts, it also doesn’t have any camels except those imported from Arabia to appease American tourists
So there’s that
It’s just, you know, 49% of Turkey is exactly like you, me, secular, western, and they already feel like shit about the shape of their country and trying to fix it while apologising about what Turkey is doing right now
Calling Turkey out as a whole based on its current government (which is barely elected) as not one of y’all actually makes people that *are* like everyone here slowly start to decide that they’re just not welcome in that club and move on
For that reason, I read but I don’t even post in r/Europe because I don’t feel super safe here
(Secular Turkish expat living in US)
İstanbul has a very high population
For decades lots of conservative people from the countryside migrated there to find work
You'll find the most modern and backwards people there living together
Its a very mixed bag
I am not very knowledgable about İzmir so other folk can explain that question better
The old IDs had a space on it that indicated your religion, and if you were born into a family that is registered as Muslim you had Islam on your ID as well
It had remained from pre-republic traditions where your religion defined your identity, and there was even a scandal a few years back where citizens of Pontic, Armenian and Jewish descent were still "marked" with the numbers 1, 2, 3 after those labels were removed over time
As far as I know the new IDs don't have them (I actually just came back home and am trying to get one before I leave, because it looks way more legit than the old ones when you're abroad and you need proof of identification when you don't have a passport)
So the 99% figure is definitely unrealistic as only people registered as Christians or Jewish or other religions are registered
You could leave it blank if you'd like by applying to the state, but from what I heard it was an arduous process and it lead to some minor discrimination when dealing with people so most people didn't do it
So a lot of estimates put the actual figure in the 90-95% range for people who call themselves Muslims in any way, and people who practice anything beyond calling themselves that shouldn't be over 50-60%.
I really don’t know
I am and my family is not Muslim but we are also automatically registered as Muslims
In my opinion, the non-believer percentage may be something between 5-10%.
Well it is estimated to be around 90%. Official records assume that everyone (except church/synagogue registered Jewish and Christian individuals) is Muslim unless they go through a ton of paperwork to be counted as non-affiliated
However, the majority of the Muslim population simply identify as Muslim and actually have a non-religious moral code
Turkish people respect their own tradition that passes down from generation to generation rather than the actual teachings of Islam (at least the one that is interpreted by Arabian societies)
If you are to visit some bigger cities you'll often see people drinking at bars which are  usually quite crowded (especially if it's evening or night time) and hear the call to prayer from the mosque at the same time
I know many Turks who drink some days and pray at the mosque during holy days
I don't know any other Muslim majority country that this would be considered normal - maybe except from Azerbaijan (we love you guys
) which is a country that has even more secular (?) population as far as I know
Yes, he has
Have you paid attention
Ending the state of emergency, and having mother tongues to be taught in schools is two
That means that Kurds will be taught Kurdish in public schools, along with many other minorities
His main motto for the foreign affairs is peace with everyone, so I doubt that
It is true that our relations with each other are not the best right now, but please keep in mind that media, especially in Turkey and Greece, can sometimes be on the nationalistic side because of the past
I strongly advise you to not believe the media until this election is settled and statements are made from elected sides
Greek media and politics aren't different from Turkey's in that matter
Create a common enemy to ignore real problems such as economy
Also no one here cares about Greece
I'm not saying no one likes Greece, we just have more important problems such as economy, terrorism and lack of education
No one here dislikes Greece, unlike some vocal minority Greeks I've seen on the internet
>Is the state media talking about the march of is it being ignored
Actually Most of Turkish media is not state owned but mainstream media in Turkey is a like joke and they can't ignore the opposition anymore but  News are full of fake propaganda
All polls suggest huge win for Erdogan and people keep saying opposition has no chance to win
no not really , new system favors the president with wide range of powers
but still, a hostile parilment can be a nice thorn in his side
"Significantly weaker", no
"Seriously undermine his efforts to actually govern the country", yes
For instance, the president can rule by decree, but if the Grand National Assembly passes a law concerning the same subject as a decree, the decree is null and the law is the rule of the day
Needless to say, if the opposition is able to consolidate and actually work together in the GNA, they can be a very, very problematic thing for Erdoğan
Hence, his statement yesterday indicating they "could go for a coalition if they can't reach 300". Ironic, seeing how Erdoğan and his sycophants advertised this new system as putting an end to coalition governments once and for all
Akşener will support and rally for İnce
I'm sure she'll convince some of her right leaning base to vote for him
İnce will also offer Akşener vice presidency
Akşener has a slightly higher chance of beating Erdoğan but İnce is the ideal candidate in my opinion
Secular yet not antagonistic to conservatives, values science highly, looks positively to the West
Also has the man of the people charm, not too elitist
AKP didn't play clean and fair at all
They printed posters that say things like "we will ban headscarf" and put CHP's symbol on them
Aside from this false flag advertising, media still pays much more attention to Erdoğan than others
Erdoğan also said in a meeting that they can "finish the election before it even begins" so at least the guy is letting us know that the election will be rigged to some degree
One of the opposition leaders is in prison even
This isn't a normal election at all
Also, while it's a good idea to guard the ballots, you can't object to legalized fraud techniques
If YSK says unstamped ballots can pass, then unstamped ballots can pass
We should always fight against injustice but things gets tricky when injustice is legal and fighting for justice is not
Unless we buy guns and shoot anyone who tries something funny I don't see how we can stop them from committing fraud
Nationalist and religious votes as well
I don't think Akşener's support by herself will be enough
I seriously doubt that
Central-right voters of the old parties (DYP, ANAP etc) (who are around %15) could support Akşener but they fear CHP so much, they would run back into Erdoğan's arms if İnce becomes his alternative
> Only statistic we do have is, CHP had more Bosniak MPs and more Bosniaks as the official active party members but that also doesn't mean anything for whom the majority of the Bosniaks do cast their votes
And we have that statistic where exactly
The only Bosniak in CHP that I'm aware of was Birgül Ayman Güler and she quit the party few years ago
AKP and MHP have far more Bosniaks in their ranks that I know of
I think the mistake a lot of Europeans make is associating Kemalism to a pro-militarist, or even jingoistic, foreign policy because the founder of the ideology was the leader of the Independence War
Takes some effort - on our part - to explain how Atatürk wasn't jingoistic at all, and instead strove for regional peace every which way he could
> Secular yet not antagonistic to conservatives, values science highly, looks positively to the West
Also has the man of the people charm, not too elitist
Don't you think he is the CHP version of Erdoğan though
Insulting the hotel receptionist, tearing the epaulettes of that general, that silly poem book, that child on the podium the other day
He is gathering the opposition votes for sure, but he is also causing rightists to gather around Erdoğan instead of İnce, out of fear
He has fallen into the trap Erdoğan set up for him, in my opinion
And his supporters are out of mind
Defending the wrongs of him by saying "Erdoğan did it too, why dont you say him anything
" Is this really the way we want our politics work
But how can we blame his supporters when he himself uses the same language
Akşener is the normalizer leader we need in my opinion
For now, at least
You won’t find much disagreement from me for any of those
I’m just sad that what got Hitler and Mussolini elected is still well alive and kicking in 2018 in this old world of ours, after all of us are so well connected to the rest of the world
Turkey should do well to remember, in the very end, we are all Romans
Neither do we need to be, which is my point
A modicum of respect for human rights and democracy is not ‘European values’, it’s *human* values, values which Turkey is failing to satisfy right now
That said, from the fact that you’re writing in Turkish in an international forum tells me that you’re not really interested in an actual discussion, so I’ll leave it at that
I'll add another voice to confirm that Greece is not discussed at all in Turkish politics, just in news, mostly about Tsipras and economic crisis, and usually with some sympathy because you guys are in a really bad position re: more established / economically powerful countries, a position Turkey finds itself in fairly often
I mean, I (and likely most of my generation) really, honestly cannot imagine a world where Greece and Turkey ends up in a military event outside of an unintended accident like a plane crashing or something that happens in Turkey that has nothing to do with Greece (like soldiers escaping the coup want asylum in Greece etc
)  Yeah there are problems, and both Turkey and Greece kind of act like dicks to each other in turns, but ultimately those are gonna be solved sitting on a chair and duking it out via paperwork, not via getting into a shitty situation with another NATO ally
I think the reason that they've not done it yet is that both Turkey and Greece has bigger problems now, not that there's animosity or anything
If anything, Greece is a fairly popular holiday destination within my circle of friends because food/drink/culture it's close enough that you feel safe, but different enough that it still feels exotic and new
A decent portion of Greek cuisine exists as part of the Turkish cuisine, but there are types of Tzatziki (Called Cacık across the shore) that don't exist in Turkey, and stuff like that
So going to Greece to eat is the food equivalent of reuniting with your long lost cousin that you never knew existed
Seriously, the only Turkish invasion you should fear is probably the one that comes with sunscreen and hawaiian shirts
I mean, I'm still a little jumpy when I meet someone that is greek anywhere in the world because I've had some random hostility from them occasionally, but that's becoming less and less of an issue, thankfully
Venizelos didn't nominate Atatürk for the Nobel Prize for nothing
No, no, no
That insult tape was bullshit, and "tearing the epaulets of the general" idea is completely legitimate
A soldier cannot be a partisan, or else he is discharged, end of story
It doesn't matter if that soldier is a hero, or not
He has a duty to not be involved in politics
Children, unlike what many believe, do not have free rein to do as they please
It is the parents' responsibility to keep the child behaving
Contrary to what many Turkish parents would believe, their child is *not* the most precious thing on Earth
There are rules, and good parenting is also teaching your child those societal rules and norms, not allowing your child to tread upon them because you love them so much
İnce does not use the same language
He does not accuse the AKP and MHP voters of being terrorists, for instance, while Melih Gökçek tweets the opposition being terrorists wholesale
He berates Erdoğan, as a person, because frankly, Erdoğan deserves to be berated
He is unqualified, completely inept, and entirely suitable to run a barber shop, not a country
Meanwhile, Erdoğan berates an entire 50% of people
There are similarities, and yet, he is not the CHP's Erdoğan
If he becomes such, the proper democrats of this country will stand up against his wrongs, as well
Right now, getting rid of Erdoğan and his sycophants is the first priority
Akşener, while okay, is far too nationalist for my taste
Either way, I'm fine with voting for whichever one come round two
There is Saffet Sancaklı in MHP
For AKP, not sure about MPs, but Hido is president's advisor and I know of some other people within the party like the last head of youth org
Bosniaks are generally organized within AKP with economic and cultural organizations and so on, but I agree, it doesn't say much about who votes how
Maybe other immigrant groups are more represented in CHP and you extend that to Bosniaks, but I've never heard of a single one in there
I agrrewith your points
What I am against is the language he uses while doing so
Let us remember Erdogan was defending LGBT rights during his campaign in 2002
Hope so, man
If it’s any consolation, even after fifteen years of this stuff, Turkey still defines itself in the context of Europe, for example, the history books that we get taught are almost entirely full of European history (helps that Turkey also plays  a large role in that)
I am reminded of this because I see that you’re from Alsace, we have an entire chapter for this whole Alsace-Lorraine debacle between France and Germany
To graduate high school, I had to write essays on Voltaire, Descartes and Montesquieu
Hell, even the world for high school is “lise”, which might be familiar
because, well, lycee
And even if you think about it - the reason why so many Turkish people feel their country is a shithole is that they compare it to England, Germany, France, not Iran, Iraq or whatever the hell is down south of Turkey
The assumption of what country to compare it to is so implicit that nobody even really consciously thinks about it — Turkey’s cohort comparisons lies in its west, even for its most conservative citizens
So those kind of things, implicit bias, gives me some hope, even the fact that Erdogan is trying SO hard to make it not so for the past two decades and *still* photos like above happen is a testament that Turkey doesn’t really see itself in the Middle East
Time will tell
I’m cautiously hopeful
Fair point, my apologies : )  thanks
I think we can both agree that Turkey was pretty much the worst place to attempt to build a nation state, and that was at best a mixed success
That said, you’re also falling into the same logical hole that you’re blaming the people who built the Modern Turkey 90 years ago — Turkey isn’t western, or non-western, it’s a multitude of things
As you yourself tell, there is no one single Turkey (since you say that Turkey could not be a nation state), but then you make petty ad-hominem arguments about how I am yearning to be European and Western (which I am not, far from it — I think Turkey is best served by being its own thing), implying that your view of Turkey is the only one that matters
I was born and educated in Turkey, I spent majority of my life there, my opinion is just as valid as yours
You want it to be not a western country, fine, you can work towards that, it is a democracy after all
I think it is still, though, so at best, we’ll have to agree to disagree
Honestly, I used to think Turkey wasn’t western when I lived in it
Only when I actually travelled to the non-western world that I realised Turkey is obviously so
You might think you’re so different than a Dane, or a Pole, or an Italian, but compared to a Japanese, a Maori or a Hmong, it is so painstakingly obvious that we are, in the grand scheme of things, bickering over fairly small differences
Nevertheless, my advice would be to travel more
No thoughts at all
Cypriot Turks are doing hell of a better job at trying to fix the situation than Turkey, they will likely be the ones to solve it
Turkey has been fairly uninterested in that problem for the past 20 years beyond ensuring the survival of the Turkish half
Cypriots Turks consistently elect anti-Erdogan candidates (I think)  so I have some hope, but I wish turkey did some more pushing and prodding to make both sides come to an actual conclusion
Turkish side of Cyprus is much more liberal than mainland Turkey and it shows
It would be unthinkable if Cypriot Turks wanted to join the southern part under a given deal, that Turkey would say no
Not only it would cause an international outroar, it is also not Turkey’s decision to make
Northern Cyprus is a fairly separate country that TR isn’t all that happy to be bankrolling to the tune of USA bankrolling Israel, considering the economic size difference of USA and TR
My friend,keep in mind ,greece had a sizeable turkish minority,that also had to leave their homes
and it all started with greek adventure in asia minor following WWI
I’m *not* going to get into who killed more who committed what atrocity when etc
at all after this comment
Because thats not my point
However, as someone with family from Selanik I very well know that the story is two sided and no it does not get personal when I visit Greece
I also know that the Aegean aide of Turkey and Greece is so similar that its hard to hate each other that much
Every single one of them are Biden's spies it's so obvious
Wet European dreams
Jesus, some people take everything face value
I have the ultimate source
Sputnik is a wonderful newspaper haha
What did Georgia do lmao
Can someone explain how and why Turkey isn't on the list
Like we're fighting against Russia in 3 wars and if they attack Ukraine it will be 4
How we're not in this list
Thought this was posted on a Balkan subreddit first
Also, I want to ask: How could this affect Russia or Bulgaria
Where do we submit the form
Let me in
LET ME INNNNNNNN
“shit weather” cracked me up lmao
I always saw them as the most civilized nation that borders my country Turkey
Lol
We won in Armenia, we're doing good in Syria and Libya
Ahh Radegast

I missed that taste so much
Wish it was available in my country also
I wouldn’t miss any excuse to drink 1 more like they did

Wow that's a lot of no votes
I was expecting this to pass unanimously
And therefore very gorgeous
Well I don't but I had the impression that there wasn't a big opposition against gay marriage in Germany

I would like to have seen this before 9/11, and even before and after WW2
Just to see how much history dictates peoples point of view on different races
huehuehuehue
Hide yo daughters hide yo jobs
Wow
Just wow
AFAIK It's because of a scandal in CSU and a leadership battle in SDP
Not sure if this support stays with them
It's unnatural to get this much support in such short time anyways
What is the ideology of Green Party ?
Oh, I didn't know that
I am Turkish so I don't really follow German politics but last week Cem Ozdemir made an interview with a Turkish journalist and I listened about the situation from him
I think just saying 'no' to refugees and having to accept them anyways due to lack of constructive policies is really popular in right-wing circles
Turkey was bored from all the Middle East bullshit so they left
Real European map, no Turkey, not a single soil of it, but half of russia, that's the logic we should all have
Still no transitria
Is that Mississippi with 11
I wish
Nobody asked me, but if you will ask, I think Turkey belongs to Middle East geographically
Just my humble opinion
But if we look culturally, Turkey lost many their values they bring from Asia, and now Turkey is like rainbow about culture, you can see small world in Anatolia
Anyway my English is bad, but I hope you got it
Then just include the European side to the map
Yes
Edit: Actually you don't need that, you can add it anyway if you want
As you can see there are some grey countries on the map without any data
Same can goes for Turkey as well
Meditterenaen is hot
Some parts of turkey are colder than some parts of scandinavia
Marginally but still, nice
middle east is just fucking black
Oh no, pufferfishes are coming
Mediterranean guys we are all gonna die
Fuck
Why Turkey looks so tired
Shit, I did not notice Belarus changed the color of their flag
I was thinking its white and red till now
Here we go again
is this a kind of modern art
Well, thats a shame
Damn, i thought you were remembering the soldiers died fighting against the Spanish
If Turkey was in list, it would be on top
So brave
Half of them from Europe

Haha we are far from modern now
It's fine, I just wasn't sure if it was a Harry Potter reference or some other joke that I didn't get
People in Northern Cyprus have Cyprus/UK passports so they're fine
Estonia's situation was explained in another comment

Does ARM count as "European"? Because they are the biggest in phones
Excuse me guys but I'm Turkish an don't get it
I can only see ordinary German and Dutch people in the picture, where is the joke
Quick, get that baby out of there
Greece and Turkey, made a big smile on my face :)

Yes homo
This was /u/anarcht 's idea at first and I spread it over /r/turkey and in /r/place
Yet no one gives us two the credit; when two subreddits were at war
Still
I believe we as two subreddits accomplished something beautiful today
Hopefully, more to come
We did it Reddit
r/wediditreddit
This is how similar Turks and Greeks are according to cultural psychology;
Source;
Comments at the bottom almost made me hate humanity
tbh
politicians act more friendly towards each other than the people
What's the reality
That Greeks/Turks wake up every morning thinking "dayum, what a fine day do remove kebab/gyro"?
What reality
Turks and Greeks do not hate eachother
Greeks hate Turkish goverment though then again who doesn't?
γεια!
The griefers were T_D afaik
[Please] we are the number 1 in oversized dictator palaces but at least Putin's is prettier
You think that's enormous
Wait until you see ours
Erdoğan's is bigger
You call that enormous
You really should check out ‘Ak Saray’ (White House in Turkish)
It is the Presidential Palace of Turkey
It costs 4 times more than the actual White House in the US
For comparison, US’s GDP is 21 times larger then Turkey’s.
I truly hope you guys can achieve what we couldn't;
Much luck, neighbors

That's a nice tv
i love the bunny paintings though
I thought it's a shoot from Bannerlord
Well that's nice
I hope they actually do some useful things like using more nuclear energy and reduce the fossil fuel usage
Well that's nice
I hope they actually do some useful things like using more nuclear energy and reduce the fossil fuel usage
Well that's nice
I hope they actually do some useful things like using more nuclear energy and reduce the fossil fuel usage
Well that's nice
I hope they actually do some useful things like using more nuclear energy and reduce the fossil fuel usage
As far as im aware nuclear has the lowest fatality rate out of all the energy sources
"The risk" is significantly lower in modern reactors than the older ones, which already had low risks to begin with
As for the cost, nuclear powerplants are expensive to build but really cheap to run
In the long run they are the most cost effective amongst the clean energy sources
And the solution he presents is not avaible in a lot of countries
It is mostly available to countries that have coasts to the oceans
Im pro-renewable but we should replace the fossil fuels with nuclear first to minimize the enviormental damage
Well, i don't really have any numbers to back it up right now to be honest, but with a little digging im sure we could find some
But anyways nuclear powerplants cost at least few billion dollars to build, this is why people think they are expensive at first
But the thing is, uranium that is required to run the powerplant is relatively cheap
And it takes a long time for a reactor to be in need of new supplies of fuel
This makes a nuclear powerplant cost effective in the long run
Why is that not a solution
As far as i know an underground depot with thick lead walls can pretty much keep all the radiation inside
If there is a leakage problem then we can find a solution like creating a huge nuclear waste storing room in a certain unhabited area like in the middle of the sahara desert or something
Why is it being radioactive for long is a problem
They can stay in an underground room for thousands of years
And it's not like we are out of space or anything
And im sure we can find other was like dumping them to space ect later on
Renewables are not yet good enough to replace the fossil fuels
And nuclear energy is the only possible solution right now
It is far better than fossil fuels
Would you rather have poisonous materials on our atmosphere or buried deep in a sealed room in the middle of a desert
It doesn't have more side effects than fossil fuel that's for sure
We are already in for a catastrophic change
But it's still manageable
If we don't immediately stop our fossil fuel usage it is going to have terrible effects for our future generations
And renewables are simply not replacing fossil fuels fast enough
It is no time to be indecisive
In future they can replace fossil fuels, but the thing is we must do something NOW
Even if we stopped all our carbon emissions today, we would feel the effects for the next 1000 years
The situation only gets worse by each passing second
We should uss nuclear instead of fossil fuels and then try to replace them with renewables later
Oh by the way, there already hundreds of nuclear powerplants, especially in France there are plenty
But they are obviously well protected
Im giving you the example of France because if they had any problems, you would feel the effects as well
But it seems that they are pretty safe so far
TIL I live in a desert
Just kidding, great work
Looks perfect  ️
Why half of Anatolia is desert
In Turkey , deserts are just a %1 of all country
Excellent work but I must tell you that Anatolia is way more green than this
Turkey
Not
A. Desert
Country
chile
not you making turkey a desert country
they are gonna drag your ass lmao
(To be honest you should've researched better
Still an amazing job though
The rope in northern Cyprus hahaha
Color choices for Spain and Turkey could be better but other than that, amazing
It’s steppe
9 in turkey
I had over 35 kids in my class
I am calling BS for Turkey
I know children 5 years younger than me had classes of 50 people
I am sure nothing can change this fast
Turkish here
During 1st grade (2001) our class was 60 (wtf)
Anyways, I earned scholarships from some private schools; switched to one of them
They had 10 students in a class, and there were 4 classes total
It puts things in perspective
Those who study at state schools don't really have much chance to learn stuff :(
When i was a first grader in turkey we had 40 children
In İstanbul average is probably between like 40 to 50
In my time my class was 48 and it should have gone up
It's lower when you take the averages of the whole country because other provinces are at a lower population density
Same goes for all countries I'd imagine
Yeah, that's pretty accurate for Turkey
yep, i visited some schools in Istanbul recently and most had 40~ students per class
however i think village schools are a big game changer here (smaller village schools may have 6-7 students per class) ~~and temel liseler, having often less than 20 students per class
edit: forget about the temel liseler, map says primary education
Primary ed tho
I used to watch its cartoon in my childhood
It was so good
Also Turkish dub of Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra was so funny
Turkish translations were splendid
Asterix, Spirou and Fantasio, Lucky Luke, Tintin, I read them all when I was young
My mother threw them all away because she thought it was just garbage
She is always throwing something important away lol
edit: BTW we call Lucky Luke 'Red Kit' for some reason I don't know
Young male adult from Turkey
Had "Asterix : Tour de Gaule" and "Asterix : Legionarre" in my childhood, both in Turkish
I can say that my decades old love for sandals can be traced back to those books
(maybe in some weird psychoanalytical way, because I was afraid of being bullied so much when I was a kid, I somehow identified myself with the Romans who consistently got punched out of their sandals and were terrified by the sight of the Gauls, and adopted the sandal as a part of my meek identity)
We had it in Turkey
I remember watching the movie as a teenager
It was fun actually
But never heard about comics
That Turkish dub was awesome
Laz architect accent was a genius idea
Ferdi Sayışman was a famous calligrapher and did the lettering for many comics around that time
He says that when they decided to publish *Lucky Luke* in Turkey in the mid 1950s, they wanted to use their own name for the character, and adopt the 'Red' from [*Red Ryder*] and 'Kit' from the title character of [*The Adventures of Kit Carson*] both famous Western stories of the time
Thus Red Kit was born
Moreover, Luke's dog Rantanplan was a parody of the famous dog Rin Tin Tin, star of [*The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin*] another Western series
So they removed the parody angle and named the dog Rintintin
Today Rantanplan is arguably more famous than Rin Tin Tin in most of Europe, including Turkey, where he is known as Rintintin
There is a stereotype in Turkey about all architects being Laz
So while every character in the movie speaks with perfect İstanbul Turkish, they had that Egyptian architect guy speaking with a Laz accent
And Laz accent sounds funny to us İstanbullers
Also the dubbers were just talented which is something hard to come by
It seems someone studying [Non-Euclidean Geometry]

What's happening in Azerbaijan
Turkey surprised me
Can you share the source of it
Therefore, maybe we can learn reasons of suicides
Turkey and Greece be like "Why kill ourselves when we have baklava
My psychiatry professor said that usually men prefer aggressive methods while women prefer more non-lethal ones and it's really hard to get a gun license in my country
She said something like men would consider a failed suicide attempt as a weakness while women suicide attempts would be a cry for help or a chance for secondary gain
Not always, mostly depends on cause of the attempt
If it's an impulsive attempt with sudden emotional changes than they regret their choice, see their attempt as a chance and usually accept help immediately
However, if it's a planned attempt with major depression or depression linked mental health problems, then they might see their attempt as failure and be dissappointed in themselves
These ones may take more convincing to take help, and riskier for repeating attempt
Well he's the host, he should be responsible for the oven
In 2k18, every political cartoon is either simple as "Orange man bad" or it's just an overlabeled piece of crap
Show who pays the most
In Turkey we have around 75% taxes on beer at the moment
Basically the movie"purge"
What a coincidence that we have the same color as Greece
i mean peacekeeping is really the sugarcoated version of being partners in a war
i was watching bbq videos throughout the whole europe you notice southern parts throw tomatoes as side while northern parts roast potatoes on charcoal so interesting
You shouldnt put turkey
All of our food is export even though we have agriculture
Where is the turkey ,  bitch  !
Happy birthday Polan
Heh
Noobs
All jokes aside, I think this is terrifying
Yes, I'm sure Poland had very hot summers, say, a century ago as well but what we currently have is very clearly something else
People living in eastern & central Europe literally talk about camping at work to avoid the effects of heatwave or complain about not being productive
In other words, Europe is already a tough place to live in and it's not even July yet
That sounds really, really bad
Luckily for me, this summer has been unusually wet and cool here but we as human beings around the world are getting really fucked
Can Europe sue America, specifically the American Republican party
I can give anything for that god damn i really dont like summer speacily if you are in city like fucking Istanbul its just worst

I miss paczki
During my time in Poland, everytime I would walk to uni and see this little bakery that was making premium quality paczki and I would be giving it to myself as a treat
There was Auchan where I could buy them for cheaper and just as amazing with different sorts of filling
I would always buy them whenever I visited that supermarket
Even though I know they aren’t the healthiest thing around, I just have a fond memory of them
Happy Fat Thursday
Happy heart attack day !
I made them once but it took me 4 hours and a half with all the waiting time
I’m not sure if the process it that long usually but I’d love to make them in a shorter time cause I get excited to eat them as soon as possible
Bread making machine idea is great though, thank you :)
The reason as to why American cars aren’t as “good” as European, specifically German cars has more to do with geography than you think
To put it simply, because America is vast and open it’s roads are mainly straight
Because of this, refined and nuanced handling as a result of more sophisticated suspension design isn’t stressed
Also because of that same reason the cars can of course be bigger and have more un, or improperly sprung weight
The American geography lends itself from getting from A to B as fast as possible and the large displacement tradition of American power-plants reflect this
Whereas in European cars the ability to navigate the tight, narrow and winding roads that were mostly built before cars is preferred and European cars reflect this
Additionally America has this sort of machismo, “authentic” every-man, anti-intellectual, anti-elegant thread that runs through it’s culture; there is a heavy correlation between that attitude in America and where in America the roads run straightest as well
> US multinationals
You realize that this is an oxymoron yes
Who owns these multinationals
It's German pension funds, Chinese billionaires, Qatari Emirs, etc
Of course American billionaires, pension funds and small private investors probably own quite a bit of these companies too, probably a bit more than foreigners, but the same american investors also hold shares in companies founded and headquartered in Europe
Same

And europeans sometimes dare to use the word “brainwashed by propoganda” when I am arguing
This is pathetic
Wait europe really think we are terrorists - turkish man
although ill be affected i wanna see how our govt reacts if we get sanctions, go towards china
I'm done with this boycotting shit, it only related Erdogan but not Turkey
Most of the Turkish people don't do anything regarding it
EU has no idea about what's really going on Turkey but has endless prejudices about everything in here, broad your perspectives, not always Erdogan means all the Turkish people
This sanctions only help erdo
He blame eu for our economies crush
How the fuck you guys connect Turkey with the terrorist attack on France
Go back to 4chan
Turkish society is pretty good rn tbh
The effects of religion is diminishing
In few decades, there will be no religious influence in the politics
What violence
Just because he called Macron an embecile (which he is) and reminded us that we can boycott France doesn't sound violence to me
There are tons of proofs that there weren't any war crimes but
The number of religious people is decreasing like hell in the new generation because of Erdoğan's policies
It really backfired bad in his side
Even religious young people don't care about religious side of politics
>rather than call out terrorists who beheaded a school teacher
We did send support before and after calling for boycott
Even our ministry of religion send their condolences
What would you want us to do
Doing nothing after a French clown publicly disrespect us
By projecting the prophet on building
Isn't that disrespectful

I'm surprised İstanbul isn't yellow - Ankara I know is a bureaucrat city and thusly has very high educational attainment, but I'd have thought that most istanbullu at least finished high school
Turkey doesn't look accurate
What

FUCK
Oops
Ankara will stand alone
Not much surprising
Except for Germany
It's obligatory secondary education process in Turkey
So the map is totally seeming weird tbh
As for tertiary in every cirty has university in Turkey
Not every university is high quality but people are undergoing a tertiary education
Ne cahil milletiz amk,ondan sonra Europe bize niye sövüyor

map is probably wrong istanbul and western anatolia has to be at least yellow

Thats literally factually incorrect lmao
It’s not mandatory to vote as far as I know
Despite that, around 80% of the population does end up voting (that was the number at a fairly recent election)
Not a lot of people don’t vote
I mean maybe like 20-30 years ago, but honestly the CHP voters today are the Turkish tourists you see in Greece ever year
Reminds me of Gezi love to Belarus
Keep going strong
Carry water and food for you and your compariots and don’t forget gas masks and eye protection even sunglasses are good
Brexit is done turn this into a win don’t get lost in the past
Erdogan might be shit on a lot of matter but he started a lot of good things going for Turkey too
When we get rid of him we plan on keeping that stuff
For example he started nationalising our military equipment and we can definitely keep that and start building over it
After he is gone and we are not actively being hated by half of the world we can sell that military stuff you know
Our drones are not worse than American drones right now they are making us loose money tomorrow when Erdogan is gonna Ukraine can buy couple of them
At the end of the day not buying but making your own will be more profitable in the long turn
Right now we have to pay for catching up and it’s a large sum but after that we will be able to produce our own and overall spend less on military equipment
Potential to sell will always be there even if we don’t it’s still better for us
You know we are already selling drones to Pakistan and Tunisia right
By when Erdogan goes away we will sell I meant we will sell to a much wider market I didn’t mean that we are not already selling some of our nationalized equipment
Right now they might be quite expensive but on the long run we will profit
While USA develops equipment by standing on previous technology we have to develop technology from zero but after few year a decade two we will also have something to stand on
Program overall until now costed us 200 million we sold 6 of Anka-S to Tunisia for 240 million dollars
Sure Switzerland incredible example for why Turkey shouldn’t produce their own equipment
Turkish tanks should not be international sales hit It’s enough if they can compete with tanks from other nations
As I said if we keep developing our own stuff and it becomes as successful as the drones I see nothing wrong with continuing
I don’t see why tank project or helicopter can’t be as successful as our drone project
I’m not against licensed production in areas where we will loose too much money and yes Turkey does plan on becoming major power one way or another
As I said we are already profiting in our drone project which had total investment of only 200 million dollars and we sold only 6 of the damn things already in the green
Also by nationalizing I don’t mean entirely government owned rather owned by government and Turkish private companies
There is state of emergency (thats what tureng told me) so this is expected
Not saying its right but not just gay people nobody can do protest in Turkey right now
While there is the chance that it may be banned if it suits the government, it really isn't a political issue in Turkey
As in nobody ever talks about it
80&#37; of turkish **voters ,** Most of Turks don't even vote for Turkish elections
Two things:
AKP got %50,5  and MHP 7% of the votes from Denmark, definitely not 80%.
The participation rate in Denmark is %34
So, only 17% of the population actually voted for them
Majority didn't care enough about the election to vote
Not to defend homophobes, but in Turkey tear gas and otherwise police brutality is the reaction to dissidents and protesters in general, not a specific reaction to a gay pride march
Basically nobody however Erdogan is trying to bring ottoman Turkish to schools so we'll see what happens in the future
Not many but more than you'd think
A great number of people can read arabic text, but they didn't take Arabic language and grammar lessons (for religious reasons
) Since it's Turkish in Arabic alphabet one in five people can understand it I guess
But this map has really archaic words it feels more arabic than turkish
Arabic script is somewhat phonetical and there sound that sound like each other
Match the similar sounding ones and unfortunately throw the rest away (e. g. No vowels) . Thank God we switched to Latin script which covers all the sounds in Turkish
Here is the full alphabet:
a (â) b c ç d e f g ğ h ı i j k l m n o ö p r s ş t u ü v y z
nephew delet this
>  A great number of people can read arabic text,
A great number ~ 0
1% of the society if not lower
1 in 5 is absurd
Just knowing Arabic alone won't allow you to read Ottoman as far as I know and and 1 in 5 people absolutely cant speak Arabic in Turkey
I was talking about this map only, it's a misunderstanding on my part
Any Turk who can read Arabic alphabet will see basic names like Avrupa, Bahr-ul Hint etc

>Turkey
Turkish cities are way way more compact than European ones - Look at İstanbul
We don't have suburbs
They’re literally a member of EU
Dude this “what if”s are even more pointless than denying Cyprus is in Europe
I think you should look up the definiton of European: “relating to or characteristic of Europe or its inhabitants
” Cyprus is European by this definiton
Burundi or Congo are whatever African or Asian country you will bring up are not
And before you bring up Australia again, no they’re not European by this definiton
They’re indeed a part of the Western culture but not exactly European, these two differ
Perhaps don’t speak so certain about these fuzzy concepts before you at least use Google
You’ll just look silly
Like come on what next, denying Germany is Europe
Man, can you drop the Australian subject please
I believe you’re better than this
Australians’ origins are European yes, so are Americans’ and so are South Africans’. But they came to a point where they built their own identity over their European roots
Not even mentioning %100 of their land being in different continents, thousands of kms away from Europe
You can differenciate this easily when you think, please stop acting like there’s no difference between Australia and Cyprus in the sense of being European
If you’re going to accept only the roots of nations as their cultural definiton of today, let’s just accept we all are Mesopotamians and live in peace hm
And if you think Cyprus isn’t Europe because it’s only 80 km away to Asia, just wait till you find out Israel is in Eurovision
The problem is you’re assuming the continent when people are mentioning Europe
Europe isn’t only a geographical term, but also a political and cultural one
You’re confusing “continental Europe” and “Europe”. For example, countries such as Bosnia and Kosovo are in Europe, continentally
But they’re not exactly European as they don’t share cultural and religious values with European countries
> Are you saying Israel is in Europe cause it is in Eurovision
I’m just telling you that European sphere of cultural influence is wider and works differently than you think and goes a little bit beyond the continental Europe
Not as far as Australia though, before you bring it up again
This is like the 4th time I’m explaining meanings of Europe in this single thread
Can you at least try to understand rather than debating for the sake of debating
> So countries like USA and Canada are kinda European as they share religious values (christianity)
So they should be on such maps
i’ll just quit this debate
In Turkey we have 2 poles for what we think over Brits, one side things they are the masters of evil, they control everywhere and every conflict, the puppeteers of America and the real threat is deep british state
The other side is pro British, we think that British are one of the only allies in Europe, at least a neutral ally, not hostile ally like Greece etc
It feels like almost Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria, Greece etc are one pact, British, Spain and all others are another
Maybe it’s because we don’t hear Brits trying to comment over our internal things and urge us this and that and no sanctions and shit
How come %3  British don't know about Ireland ?
Its literally right next to you
It is funnier then you think the number is lower for Norway, Sweden
etc
I love how random some of these are, genuinely made me laugh when I saw that %12 hate Moldova
They call themselves Great Britian , but even they are scared of the might of Albania
Feels weird knowing that Turkey is known more than Russia and Netherlands
After all those anti-Turkish brexit posters, it's really a shock for me to see that amount of positive opinions
TIL turkey is more well known than germany in england
I thought we would be head-to-head with Russia
I'm a bit surprised tbh
Is it possible to not heard of Russia
Wow that was hurtful
I had a very positive opinion of Estonia
Then I watched the movie Klass
Even though I am in Latvia now the sight of a group of teenagers makes me feel uneasy
No idea why a single movie hit me so hard but it destroyed me when I first watched it probably almost ten years ago
It’s in your blood, embrace it
Destroying even the god’s trust is also erotic appeal
I wouldn’t mind Brit rule, at least there would be some sort of class and lots of real football
(not pussy ass football these germans, italians, and french try to pass around)
I don't agree with the way you communicate your message but really, how is expecting the citizens of a country to speak the language of that country is nationalism
I see this being done to Turks all over Europe, they receive a lot of backlash for having Turkish signs, living in all-Turkish neighborhoods and speaking only Turkish
Should I say to the German/French/Dutch etc people that they are nationalistic
They are right, they should learn the language and integrate
With this logic a lot of French people are nationalistic as they have a strong "This is France, speak French" approach
Bro how do you get groceries
Someone's gotta ask the important questions
That's so beautiful

I don't know which language is this, but it's too clear to understand
Idk
Corny
It's mostly basic English, no way 97% of the Netherlands speaks English
My dad claims to speak English, but I know the extent of his skills and believe me it's not very impressive, I assume it's the same with most other countries
The gap between the U.K. and the rest of Europe however does exist
Good idea
For Turkey, primary foreign language is English, followed by German
In fact, there are more people speak German amongst elder people than those speak English as a result of German being the primary foreign language in schools until 80s/90s. There is a relatively big group of francophones since we have French schools in most of the major towns
And of course you can find people speak Arabic fairly easily
Did not include Kurdish as I don’t consider it as a foreign language, it is the mother tongue of ~15% of our population
That's really amazing

Living in Turkey and Erdoğan is the worst leader I have ever seen
He ruined Turkey in two decades
I hope he will lose elections
As a Turk I love this
Sen niye yüzmüyon lan
For all Europeans to know, especially with his decreasing popularity, sanctions and harsh actions against Turkey would work only for Erdoğan
He's on the way to his own downfall
Nobody anticipates him to win another election, even if he does, his majority votes will be gone
He yearns for a new enemy and a new source of agitation
His voter base are just fucking imbecciles who would fall for his ''EU can't handle our swag and trying to block our glorious facts, you see what I'm dealing with here
Destabilising an already suffocating Turkey won't serve nobody, least of all to Europe
Politics isn't that simple
Erdoğan is real football player
Who is that Pókemon
I don't understand why do europeans want to sanctions on Turkey ? Turkey isn't a threat for European Union if you compare Turkey and European Union
Well, its gonna change soon

There is overwhelming violence against women in Turkey
And the first think the absolute ignorant cunts asks: `well, what was she wearing
`, ` what is she doing there this late
The years 1980-1983 were very dark years for Turkey - a paranoid nationalist military junta coupled with guerilla warfare in the countryside and massive political repression
Add torture in military prisons, kangaroo courts, and state-funded assassinations to that
Pardon my French, but the bastard who caused all that died before his jail sentence was approved
Turkey is the country with most arrested journalists
Mostly because at the time, they criticised the government
Delusional
The 1980s were better than 1970s in the sense that there wasn't an undeclared civil war
The 1970s saw much bloodshed, massacres and riots in Turkey as well as an economic crisis and literally no government
So it was *better*, not exactly *good*.
I see another Turk above me has said an iron fist was necessary
While it might have been necessary to rein in far-left and far-right terrorists, nothing can excuse the torture, forced disappearances and arrests
It was a very dark time
No they are not
I think the commentor is emotional in this one and only look at bad things, therefore didin't mention why thr coup happened
In that years the left and right wing fights happened everday
Everday people died because of that political beliefs
The state itself were more islamic than ever (you can look at "kudüs mitingi" which is endorsed by third biggest political party, MSP, at that time)
New religious cults established that time (thanks to MSP again)
Economy was literally shit (the president itself said that "we need even 75 cent"), terrorism was at its peak (politic terrorists killed people in their house, in universities, in cinemas), then there was islamic terrorism where hundreds of alevies killed
Yes, the woman couldn't go outside, the lovers couldn't travel, because they were in fear of being beated by islamics
There were no goverment because nobody was majority
Then there was president elections(cumhurbaşkanı) the 2 candicates couldnt get majority of votes despite election held dozens of times in the senate
My parents, grandparents and the majority of the elders, all says the same thing
"The coup was a necessity and it was known" even the politicians haven't done anything against it
Nobody, even the politicans, against to the coup
Only ones affected by it, *when the coup happened*, were hardcore islamics, hardcore nationalists and terrorists
Everyone knows bad things, political tortures, murders happened after the coup, they weren't necessity, this things must be done in front courts, justice should have been applied
Personally I think, and everyone I know, an iron fist needed for turkey at that time, country was driven to a civil war more than ever
Also, commentor is wrong about paronoidsim of junta
Junta wasn't paranoid they, the terror was real in eastern proviences (I have lived there about 5 years, even a lot of kurds, despite hating military, support the coup because of terrorism *again*)
There were wrongdoings of junta too, they tried to erase kurdish language identity thinking that will erase the terrorism too, but it only strenght it
Correct, but that's something a lot of people know about
The 1980 coup gets very little attention in foreign media
Eh no, hardly relevant at all
In fact, the general who orchestrated the 1980 coup was prosecuted under Erdogan's government
Not to add the CIA and NATO directly supported said military junta
Although the coup helped political Islamism
Before the coup, Turkish identity was considered to be primarily a merger of Central Asia and Anatolia which was emphasized by constant references to the Hittites and whatnot
The coup leaders created the "Turkish-Islamic Synthesis" that considered Islam an essential part of Turkish culture
Cyprus, if I have to
No need for unification talks anymore
People either move to Turkey or Greece
Done

Sorry neighbour but I'd really love to have the big Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea

France and Turkey(not really, ottoman empire) are some of the first countries to legalize homosexuality
France in 1791
Ottomans in 1858
Always been legal in Turkey since its foundation
Whats a proggresive law
Giving people the freedom to not endure pain any longer
Why should suicide be painful when their life is already painful enough
Marriage is unfortunately not legal yet
Nobody forced her to take the job
Suleiman the magnificent: Hey, since we are so deep into the enemy territory, why not take Vienna as well
Army: what could go wrong
*Winged Hussar Noises*
Enver Pasha going sicko mode and attacking Russia because he wanted to build a great Turkic empire with Central Asia
He lost half the fucking country
It's been a while since we passed bruh moments
It's now way beyond this
A 6 months old baby dying of cold in his house with no heating
Or a father committing suicide because he could not buy new pants for his child
(20 tl was found in his pocket, equal to 2€) There are many more
Mother giving hair dryer to elder kid to keep warm and hanging herself in the other room
Have literally no idea about the native language equivalents of the terms I use on a daily basis since I have always learned/taught/been taught/written about them in English
It's a bit disturbing when I have to talk about them in Turkish
I thought I was the only one
I sometimes even have to google them because all I know is the English version of the word and not the word in my language
To be honest I don’t like my accent
I know it is very difficult to pronounce a word correctly
Because, we straight read the word
Writing and sound form of a word is same
It makes hard province it
For Turkey, it is because of prices
An iPhone costs double the price in what it costs in USA with taxes
For a long time it was cheaper to travel to USA and buy iPhone rather than buying in Apple Store in Turkey
Other thing is purchase power of household
minimum wage currently around 300€~ so this limits what technology you can buy while hunger limit for 4 people house hold is 400€~.
In Turkey it is about the prices
While Android phones try to adjust their price wit the economy of the people
Apple usually has a standart price
Stop comparing an os and a device
Android is as good as ios
However many top tier android devices are worse than iphones
Consider comparing google pixels and iphones
Price/Performance
And iPhone users don't bully Android users here
Though I'm not from Adana, I heard from my friends some neighborhoods in there have such places that police can't go in))
İm not ashamed of Istanbul but the im ashamed of the way we treat it
That city deserves better care
The same goes for Istanbul
Porto has personality
I have mostly worked with honest people like they would say if they couldn’t wake up or lost track of time, etc
But there are phases like “There was a car accident
” “Buses were full
” “I forgot something at home and had to return back
” These were what my friends have told or I have heard from someone else
“There was a traffic
” Which often times doesn’t have to be a lie
I just mostly lie about the duration of the traffic, if I’m being late
The interviewee who almost got the job but then got mad at a question and started screaming at the interviewer
Wait
we did that tho
I sense pettiness in this comment
There was some talk of it after the coup but i don't think anyone has actually proposed it into parliament
And even if they do Erdogan himself can't pass it with his coalition alone(by himself he can do a referendum in it) so it's unlikely to happen to say the least
That saidn
#AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Yea, Our ruling party is a bunch if shitheads that seem to get elected because"they built roads"
That said,
#AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I am pretty sure it's a constitutional thing which requires a supermajority to directly pass and Erdogan has only 341 of the 350 required
Edit: Actually he can't even put it to referendum as that requires 360 votes and directly passing is actually 400 votes
I have been taught British English but Internet and Media is heavy influence by American English so that creates problem for my vocabulary
I try to solve the problem by only using British English(speaking as well as writing)
no, even i learned british english at school, I always use american english because i like it more
so because i’m already used to speak american english, i don’t mix them
Yes, that's normal I guess
Here in Turkey, the norm is British English in the classroom so that's basically what you learn
Then you have the popular media predominantly in American English so you pick up lots of things from there as well
The end result is a mix
Learned and learnt
I've never used "lift". I prefer "elevator".
All the names of the Turk rulers’ names
The most popular ones: Kaan/Kağan (means ruler, also referred as Khan in English) , Mete, Teoman, Oğuz (ancestors of Turkish Turks), Alparslan, Atilla (Attila, you all know who), Batuhan etc
There is Cengiz (Ghengis) although he’s a Mongolian ruler, it’s also a Turkish name
There are names from Turkish mythology or eposses such as: Buğra, Ceren, Serenay, Gökhan, Kürşat etc
There are just too many of them
More than I can count
Most of them are from Turkic rulers, mythology, eposses or nature
I’d like to add that we share a lot of common names with Mongolians too
Kaan, Kaǧan, Atilla, Ata, and we have the -han suffix
Like, Gökhan(khan of the sky) Atahan(Forefather khan) and stuff like that
Kaan, or Kaǧan is like a saying double han
Hanhan, if you will
Like king of kings
Aysu, Esin, Beyza, Asena(very cool name imo), Başak, the list goes on
The oldest one I can think of right now is probably Osman, it was the name of Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Empire
We use name Atilla a lot
Baltic German
It’s Arabic, not Turkish
Edit: The name the commenter below said was Abdülahmet or something but he changed it to Osman
Gökhan is from mythology
It means ruler of the sky
Must be written Gökhan
Otherwise it does not make sense
Gök means sky, and the name means King of the Sky
Gokhan simply isn't a thing
Kaan and Kağan are the same, yes
But social backgrounds matter
Kağan is a name given by more educated families, as it is the correct form of the name
Kaan is a lazy version that could be given by a lower class of family
I know, sounds rough
But it is the truth to some degree, as both are considered legit names
I believe it is, Gök Kağan
People who are less educated tend to give Arabic names to their children, as they are more religious and do not consider things like how the Arabic culture is invading ours and corrupting it
My parents are academics, and I have a Turkish name, and I am grateful for it
I wouldn't have wanted an Arabic name, at all
But other than that, we do have variations to some names
But class hierarchy is often indicated by accents and way people speak
Much like how it is in most other countries
>  People in villages will have lower class names than people in cities
This holds true in some regions of Turkey
Nah that never happens but I do forget some Turkish words from time to time and translate the English word in google translate
Sometimes but it doesn’t happen very often
Once I didn’t recognise my own language
I had a friend from Mali who didn’t speak Turkish well so we mostly spoke English
One day, I was translating him to my Türkmen friend and she stopped me mid sentence and said that he’s speaking Turkish
Turns out he switched to Turkish while talking but I didn’t realise and kept on translating Turkish to Turkish
I also forget words which makes me sound pretentious when I say it out loud
The worst part is when they aren’t compatible
Sometimes English is better at describing something, but it sounds icky used in my native
Well, no, it doesn't sound like gibberish
But most of the time I speak English with my friends and at this point we probably speak better English than Turkish
I can relate
My sister and I sometimes bring German to the mix (I took German in high school and she took courses)
My mom has gotten used to it to the point she starts mocking with gibberish sounds
Turkey has the oldest known place of worship, the approximately 12 thousand year old Göbekli Tepe
Santa Claus was born in what is today Turkey
The oldest church in the world is located in Turkey, rumoured to have been founded by Saint Peter
The first female combat pilot was Turkish, along with the first female jet combat pilot and according to some accounts, the first black combat pilot
Turkey has the highest per capita tea consumption, at over 3 kilos per year
Our national anthem is the only anthem in the world that starts with "Fear not
" (Korkma
The oldest man built structure "Göbeklitepe" is situated in Turkey, Şanlıurfa, dating back 12 thousand years ago
Turkey is the most tea consuming country in the world
In Hagia Sophia (which is a museum, obviously
), there is a carved text (dating back to 9th century) by a Viking which says "Halvdan was here
Anatolia has served 3 very important land trade routes which are: Silk Road between China and Anatolia, Royal Road by Darius I. and Spice Roads (mostly by the coast)
This is because Turkey is the bridge between Europe, Asia and Middle East
FunFact: Both Silk Road and Spice Roads were blocked by first Seljuks, which caused the failed crusades, and then by the Ottomans, which started the Age of Discovery (because the Ottomans had closed the roads, Europeans had to find another route
While trying to go around the world, they found America and other routes around Africa
Let me try:
*Last night, (I) my friends with very fancy a restaurant to went
Yeah
It's horrible
This interesting an experience bewill
Grammarour, European Languages to very different
My language actually very simple me according
But others that be don't think
Definitely, but I have a suggestion in addition: Can't we just hold world cups or Olympics permanently in a neutral country/city
It seems like there'll be corruption and crimes swept under the rug no matter who is chosen if we get somewhere new every 4-5 years
Hell, there could be a permanent "International Olympic Village".
I nominate Switzerland
I mean, is qatar bad
If so, yeah, of course
But i havent heard a lot of bad things about qatar, certainly not as much as other countries in the region
Probably just me not paying attention to the news and stuff
I nominate the car parking place in the Vatican
> Switzerland is already seat of all those highly corrupt organizations hosting those events
FIFA and the IOC both have their HQ in Switzerland
Both organizations are highly corrupt deep into their cores
I'm aware, I just couldn't think of another ultra-neutral country large enough to have Olympic sports facilities
oof, thats not good
thats all i can say
Regarding the guardian article, I suggest taking a look at [this flood on Twitter,] it's quite informative
Obviously, Qatar (or the GCC in general) is not the best place in the world to be an immigrant worker in construction, but that article sounds extremely biased with exaggerated numbers and questionable sources
It is sad to see so many people are ready to believe those manipulative numbers in the article without even bothering to see if they have reliable sources or considering how realistic it would be to have 10 work-related deaths per week on average for 10 years between 2010-2020
Qatar has come a long way in terms of workers' rights especially comparing to other countries in the region, and it's all due to the international pressure they face
With the new labor reforms, workers can now change jobs or leave the country without the consent of their current employees, they now have minimum wage with compulsory allowances for food and housing, free healthcare for everyone, etc
This will have positive long-term consequences for everyone in the region in the long run
They still have a long way to go obviously, but what I'm saying is maybe there's a more productive way other than boycotting that gets you some actual results
Erdogan has stated a while back :
"If they have dollar we have God (on our side)"
referring to the economic crisis of the Lira losing value
But there is definitely more stupid things than this
"We'll be a superpower in the year of 2023" -Erdogan
"Our economy is stable and growing the one who says there's an economic crisis are terrorists
" -Erdogan
"We will destroy every piece of nationalism
" (Later on makes an alliance with the nationalist party like a chad and uses natinalist propaganda" -Erdogan
"Say that to the litte Turgut" - Turgut Özal
"Aegea is not a greek lake, neither a turkish like
Because Aegea is not a lake
" -Süleyman Demirel
"Tükeş is son of Turk, Erbakan is son of Islam, Ecevit is son of people, and am i a son of a bitch
" -Süleyman Demirel
"Why we should close the brothels
The people will fuck us if we do that" -Süleyman Demirel
"Close the brothels so that citizens come here to fuck us
-Süleyman Demirel, who served in 7 governments in various positions; he was the prime minister in one of them and also became the president later on (back when that position was purely symbolic)

Devlet Bahçeli (there's two but I remember only one): 2009
Add the numbers, you get: 11
Remove the zero's you get: 29
(in a hyped way) ADD 11 AND 29 TOGETHER, YOU GET 40, IT'S OFFICIALLY OUR 40^TH ANNIVERSARY

how about "40 YAPAR"
"40 YAPAR" -Devlet Bahçeli
I'll ask one out of context question, how do you pronounce the 6^th letter of the politican's first name
Süleyman Demirel was a real memer
Oh that's just straight up karen-like behaviour
hmm, I haven't heard about this before
Pro gamer move
i havent heard that too, we banned it cuz of the infos on YPG/SDF page of wiki
I get the joke but the statement is referring to the political power of the dollar since Trump was threatening with embargo
Hahaha that's gold
He said it to a physicist (Erdal İnönü)
By saying "Little Turgut" he actually meant his grandson lol
I mean you're pretty much there, didn't even notice an error in there
Thanks, I wondered ever since I saw that letter
Well, i didnt know that till u say
Tnx for the info and being sensible :)
Holy crap it's (nearly) exactly the same with me
I was born december 2006, I learned basic vocabulary from minecraft, and the speaking from movies and YouTube vids
The unthinkable happened, mosques are closed(sort of) and Call of Prayer in Turkish as “Don’t come for prayer, do it in your house”.
Context, Erdogan’s main argue on mosques is that opposition(supposedly) has turn them into barn(literally minimum 70 years ago) now Erdogan’s government practically closed the mosques and Erdogan said they Called for Prayer in Turkish which was bad (because showing Arabic and Arab culture as in Islam)
Today gave information in mosques for not to come in Turkish which it considers as Call of Prayer
Current government is actually taking some action
Mosques are closed
Mosques are no more
Finally they did something reasonable
From Istanbul to all Europe, just by a train
Would be superior
Look for my country first if someone has replied or not, if not answer it first then read other replies
I always see them
My dad was so affected by some of them when I was a kid that he would talk about them nonstop
It went on for like a solid two three years
Gonna sound cliche but turkey
You know, the bird
Metan gas
I thougt the pronunciation was weird because I have heard it many times in Turkish
You make the “a” a little longer
There has never been an anti-German sentiment in Turkey in the last 30 years that I can remember
On the contrary, Turkish people who are born in Germany typically end up in some form of Germanophilia if they come back to Turkey for work at some point
We don't have anything against germans but generaly we don't like the Turks in Germany
They are often rich and stupid
Even though they earn there and spend it here they say that Turkey is heaven and germany is hell
And they vote for dictators when they don't even encounter the consequences
Nah we make a lot of dark jokes about them but i guess we like germans in a way
There are a lot of turks that like in germany so it is expected
Oh it might be different among those who reside in Germany, to me it seems the diaspora Turks are overly conservative and nationalistic, much more so than the people living in Turkey, which is more or less expected I guess
Mine is merely a personal observation, of course
I've probably interacted/still interact with 10-20 Germany-born Turkish people tops in my working context
But the general attitude I've seen among them is quite Germany-centric
It seems they have some sort of a "German, good, non-German, bad" mentality while interpreting daily or professional occurrences
I can imagine the things that you frequently see or encounter, really
But your assumption has two major flaws:
You don't get to see/notice the ones who are already integrated well
That's because they just act normal and there's no way to know how many they are
The psychology and sociology of criminal behaviour is way more complicated than one's national identity, if not ethnical
Certain identities are believed to commit more crimes than others; however, empirical research shows that immigrant status and criminal behaviour are actually inversely related ([an example study] What many people seem to suggest as a solution, namely deportation, does not even reduce the crime rates ([an example study]
It's more like a complex web of interacting factors, caused by both immigrants themselves, natives of the host country, the legal system itself, education, culture, and many more
I am just talking about the general prejudice and it's according to some interviews
It's general there are good people all around the world but I am glad you don't have a problem with it
Lol There are a lot of Turks there doing that too
Germans don't like Turks
Oh I personally believe there is at least a group of immigrants who consciously refuse to integrate, which is quite difficult for me to understand
And I believe so both because of my personal observation and the fact that such a conscious refusal has resulted in at least [one theory] related to learning the language of the host country
In social science, apparently it is still an ongoing debate if people actually refuse to integrate or not as I understand from [this] study, which seems to review both arguments
There's also the issue of cultural hybridisation, by the way
Those clusters you've mentioned typically form their own (a third) culture, which borrows from the cultures of both host and home countries but is essentially different from both
And the issue gets even more complicated after that since it reaches a point where those people are accepted neither in their home country or their host country
Btw my country is no big shot too
Their education level are compareable to those in germany or austria
Carefour is French
I thought we owned it becaise we had our old reliable SA(Sabancı Company) symbol on it
It turns out that they just colabrated with each other
I always thought Nokia phones were Japanese until I was informed that it is in fact Finnish
The phone manufacturer casper
I didn't think that it could have been Turkish
I thought it was like American
Really ? isn't "kinder" means children in German ?
I always though Germans give great easy name to a chocolate brand :)
Now, that makes two of us, mate
God bless
What you guys really need is price fixing for certain medical services
The government already allocates enough tax money into health care to give everyone ample health care as is
Not much without a filter
Not many people trust tap water that changes color time to time
I don’t even water my plants with tap water lol
All the time
At this point I dream, think, even remember my memories in English
Do NOT say "Oh, i thought you would be speaking arabic
" or " I didnt know women were allowed to not wear hijabs
Be extra nice to stray animals, especially cats
In the wrong neighborhood you can get hospitalized for kicking a cat
Never talk about politics, religion or sexuality with people you don't know very well
Pretend to like food even if you don't.
Don't be too loud when you're talking in your own language
Only the Japanese and koreans get a pass because we like them very much for some reason
You are expected to take your shoes off when you're in a clean place, such as houses or mosques
People of the same gender might get physical with you, kissing, hugging, putting their hands over your shoulder
It means they're trying to be nice to you
Just go along with it
Old people have very high expectations in terms of respect, be passive when conversing with them
Don’t publicly criticize Erdoğan or you go jail bye bye
-We're not talking Arabic and we're not Arabs and most of the people would be mad if you say "i thought you were arab etc"
-Do not talk about religion with the old people specially in central anatolia
(Western anatolia is more tolerant about it)
-Armenian Genocide (it is not a historical event anymore it became just a political tool so people would disagree with you and won't even listen you)
-Take off your shoes before entering a house
(And a tip never trust the taxi drivers
Never
This doesn't apply to foreigners obviously
Turkish and kurdish speaking
Arabic direved words do exits in turkish but they are very much adapted to turkish
When it comes to religion i would say it is much more religious than Europe but much less religous than the Middle East
The thing about Turkey is that we always live things in extreme
I mean we had the caliphate before the Turkish Republic was founded but right after the Republic was founded we adapted a very french way of secularism where doing things like wearing hijabs in certain places were prohibited
Now we are kind of in a limbo where we dont know what we are doing
If you are interested in this topic and have like 4 hours to spare watch the videos of Kraut about Turkey
(Sorry for being long lol)
I think it is more spoken by refugees
Idk tbh i just hear arabic when my grandma prays lmao
Turkish in general applies to this as it is very different from European languages
A simple example coming to my mind is Assassin's Creed Revelations
It was very clear voice actors had a hard time
By the way in comics Magneto was German Jew if I remember correctly
Writers of the movie probably forgot this and ran as a Polish Jew
Yeah it sounded as if someone was choking them I laugh whenever I see a clip of AC Revelations the people on the street sound even funnier than the ones in cutscenes,another great example of horrendous Turkish voice acting would probably be Uncharted 2 it was a realy good game but the Turkish was realy funky
(the Turkish spoken by guards were bad the dub they did for the game is top notch)
My main problem with games and movies that portray Turkey,West Asia or South America is that disgusting looking yellow tint they use as a filter it looks so bad and the music is always off as well instead of using Turkish music they sometimes use bedouin music I even heard Indian music once
People have no idea what Turkey is like
Exactly
It is like (not all Americans) Americans think outside of their circle (NA/west EU) all the world is same with minor differences
It is also a fact that Turkish language and culture are very different for someone never heard of them
Thank you, I kinda forgot Magneto was in Poland at the start of the movie
That explains everything
People that live in the mountains communicate with guns
You shoot to the air to say hi/im here and the other person shoots back to confirm that he/she heard the gunshot
Yeah, it is very normal to greet people while on hiking
Same in Turkey
If you said to a torrenter "you are a thief" he'd just look at you like you said the world is flat or something
He wouldn't say "you are wrong" he would just be puzzled
That concept is just alien here
People don't want to pay like 1/6 of their wage on one video game
Mutlu Noeller ve Yeni Yılınız Kutlu Olsun
Joyeux Noël et bonne année
In Turkish we have the “German Way” of paying the bill
It means everyone pays for only what they ate
I have no idea why we call it the German Way though
Fransız kalmak means to be left french
It means to feel foreign or you can use it when someone is looking blankly
"*Alman Hesabı*" (German Constant) in Turkish
That's weird and interesting to see, every nation have the same expression with a different nation
We have "Alman usulü" (the German way) for splitting the bill, and "Çingene düğünü" (Gypsy wedding) to refer to a loud crowd of people
Those are the only ones that come to mind
“Alman hesabı” is our phrase for “to go Dutch”. Alman means German in Turkish and the root of the second word (hesap) means “fee/bill”. I believe it comes from Germans’ hard discipline
I’ve witnessed some of them even split the food and mark the juice bottles
Also we have “Fransız kalmak” which means “to not understand the context”. Fransız means French and the whole phrase could be translated as “being French”. I don’t know why French though
In Turkish we have "Olaya Fransız kalmak" (verbatim: "to be all French to something") which means "to be a stranger to something".
I believe you say "be all Greek to something" in English
Are we strong captain
- well acording to french yeah
Erdoğan must be jealous
He had to win a "referendum" and an "election" before he could get those powers
Hungary's trajectory is looking very bad
We're out here, hoping to be democratic again but instead more countries are starting to be like us
Sad
Kicking Hungary out of EU isn't going to kick Orban out of Hungary
Whenever EU is bad with us, Erdoğan uses it like "imperialist colonialists don't like it when we don't obey them" and such rhetoric works magic on the whole nation
A dictator needs enemies to present himself as an underdog to his nation
Remember this comment in the next election in Turkey because I'd bet my ass on the line that Erdoğan is going to fuel a diplomatic crisis with some countries again when that happens
People say things like "let's embargo Turkey" something like that would actually help Erdoğan
Europeans have a really hard time understanding the mind of a dictator and the mentality of a nation that lives under their rule, which is understandable
You might ask "then what should be done
" I don't know
I think these are phases countries have to go through
Intervening accomplishes nothing
I'm not a fatalistic guy at all, but you can't stop a nation from ruining itself
There's always someone else to blame
Authoritarian leaders always create false enemies, they never admit their fault
It happened here too
Erdogan got limitless power, destroyed the economy but won't take responsibility for it
Illiberal democracies tend to keep "the enemy" vaguely defined
That's why all this "Brussels" and "George Soros" business is there
This way you can put any word you want into their mouth, and your people will complete the rest of the definition of "the enemy" depending on their personal thoughts and therefore share the burden of creating propaganda with the people
Creating an adequate amount of propaganda through state channels is not possible unless you got 1984 tier propaganda channels, you have to involve the people
Things being clearly defined is not a good thing for the ruling party
The only thing that should be clearly defined is that the government is good and "the enemy" is bad
By keeping everything everything vague, creation of an alternative reality that most of the nation can believe in becomes easier
I don't know much about Hungary's station, but the way leaders like that act isn't much different wherever you are in the world
Also I doubt EU money is the thing that's keeping Orban from wanting to quit
Money you can't embezzle is not money
And embezzling EU funds should be really difficult I'd imagine
I'd say he wants EU to kick Hungary instead to get some sweet propaganda weapons, as if he'd become a martyr, but I don't know much about it like I said so I might be mistaken
Construction sector is the darling of oligarchs
Erdoğan is fond of it too and it works exactly the same way you said
I see a lot of similarities
Depends on the accent, sure
When rural southerners talk to one another in my presence, I can hardly understand half of what they say
They say in a sarcastic tone “Not everyone has to study
This country needs porters too
” Personally, I find it quite condescending for the people who got the short end of the stick in life
McDonald’s and garbage man also come to mind
We can add body shoppers, textile workers to that list as well
I can't even work at McDonald's (or at least be a cashier) because my math is shit lmao
That if you don’t study well, you’ll end up working at a McDonald’s.
"Eğer okuyup adam olmazsan çöpçü veya inşaatçı olursun, ya da sanayide çalışırsın."
"If you don't study and be a man, you would be a garbageman or a builder, maybe you would be a worker in an industrial area"
Body shoppers or car mechanic
I wish I was a car mechanic though
Earn more than what I do now
Same
Years ago my family doctor told me to become a “water heater repairman” (şofbenci)
Apparently he called a repairman and found out he makes more than my doctor
that all we eat is not Turkey ...
Turkey is not a desert-covered country
We have a very diverse geography and climate here
In spring, you can watch the Bosphorus while blossomed judas trees covers the region and then next day, travel to east to visit some beautiful ski resorts still covered with snow
We have both cold glaciers and sunny, relaxing beaches
Being located in Middle East doesn't mean we live in sandy deserts and ride camels
Poland had penguins too right
It used to be mandatory in here up until 2016
Then some retard in high court thought it was against human rights to force taking shots without parent’s consent
Talk about going backwards
God I hate this government so much
It is unethical to force anyone to take substances in their body
I do not support mandatory vaccinations
As for anti-vax, I blame it on the big corporations who have broken the trust of people
Anti-vax originated from the USA
Looking at the prices of their medicine and shit like the opioid epidemic, why should anyone trust big pharma
Restore trust in the public that you have good intentions in everything and stop fucking up with everything then you wl get people vaxxing again
You are right
Rights for children work differently
Legal guardians are required by law to provide for their children
Deliberately starving a child is legally abuse
Should not vaccinating be abuse as well
Humans get hungry to know when to eat
But there is no natural desire to get vaccinations
However I draw the differences here
Food there is still choice
But a vaccination is a very certain substance
Your analogy to food would be more accurate if parents were force to give their kids milk
If a certain food like milk is singled out then it would be unethical
Yea, no
It isn't the same thing
We have a food called "[gözleme] which also mean observing
I saw a guy selling this food with a label written observing :)
Probably a handicraft symposium (el işi sempozyumu) being translated as hand job symposium
They tried to write handicraft
Maybe father is the cook and she does him
Just a theory
Well, that's good
~~Finally the entire country won't be sold to the Russians for cheap~~
It is about 30 °C and humid but I have learned how to exist within the hotness
Days are not that bad
Sun is hot but i just get under a shade
And there is good airflow too
But nights are the bad one
I cant even sleep
I just get so sweaty and lumpy
When i open the window the cats try to get in, so i cant even open windows
Turn on AC
Shower twice a day
Go out in the evening
That temperature is standard for us but this year we didn’t have winter and summer came early so that kinda sucks
It’s my favourite season but it’s hard to enjoy it when you’re cooked up at home because of pandemic
Edit: grammar
It happens, can't explain
My parents can't do it but I can
I like the weather and sun a lot
Everywhere and everything feels alive in this season
The temperature makes me energetic and joyful
Also, swimming
Beaches are windy in other seasons but in summer, you can truly enjoy it
The breeze coming from the sea feels so nice
I just love everything about it, man
Turkish people are born with their tea cups(the curved ones that are called 'ince belli' in turkish, i don't know how to translate it, a direct translation would be slim waisted but it sounds weird too
“Local Frenchman too angry to yield terrorism”
“Türkiye Devleti bir Cumhuriyettir
State of Turkey is a Republic
This article can’t be changed under any circumstances which is protected by the article 4
Ottoman lovers can keep dreaming
Turkey is a republic
Turkish Republic is a humanitarian, Kemalist Nationalist, secular, social and law-bound state within the context of social solidarity and peace
Turkish Republic, with it’s government and nation is an undividable whole, It’s language is Turkish
It’s flag is a white crescent and a star on a red background
It’s national anthem is the march if independence
It’s capital is Ankara
The first three sections in this constitution can’t be changed and their unchangibility is undisputable
Turkey
**ARTICLE 1-** The State of Turkey is a Republic
Also, Art 4 states that provision of Article 1 (with two other aritcles, 2 and 3
)  shall not be amended, nor shall their amendment be proposed
There’s enough of them to make my blood boil
[This one
There are worse parts of South-East Turkey that suffer from terrorism but my mother's family is from a town called Kilis that had a population of ~100k but now hosts around 150k Syrian refugees due to proximity to the Syrian border
It's a very difficult situation for everyone
The part that has kept this madman in charge ever since I was born
Southeastern Turkey
Most unstable part of our country
There are some terrorist because of the proximity to the middle east
Also the infrastructure is not as good as in the western parts
Central Anatolia
It’s very bland, the climate is dry and it’s underdeveloped
You don’t see many people planning a trip there
I feel sorry for people who has to live there
(That’s excluding Ankara but personally I don’t find it interesting either
Armenian thingy
East parts due to terrorism
All except West ?
(and some minorities in big cities)
Yeah
Ankara isn't interestin either
Sure
Its pretty good
Its stable, beautiful architecture( mostly old Armeanian churches and old russian buildings), good infrastructure
It holds a lot of tourists from within Turkey and also a lot of tourists from Iran
I would recomend visiting this region
Especially city of Kars
Its really beautifull, still needs some renovation tho
There are lots of people in Turkey is not ethnically Turk
But this doesn’t make them terrorist
Most of these terrorist follow separatist movement since 1980’s.
Probably the Coup/Revolution of 27th May 1960
Or there is 3rd May 1944 when pro-nazi authors and politicians were put on trial
That turkish independence war was also a civil war
We were not just fought with greece, allience and armenia but the ottoman sultanate(Istanbul goverment), islamist and kurdish rebellions too
It looks like a sad story 2 years
C’mon Ivaylo you can do better
That is literally one of the most famous battles in Central European history
And it isn't about your country either
Not nazi fascist
It’s also not independence war but liberation war which is very minor mistake but a lot of our historians try to fix this for a long time including Halil Inalcık himself but west seems to no give a fuck
I haven't checked *all* other languages but Turkish (and Azerbaijani I guess) differenciates between witnessed and heard information by adding suffixes
&#x200B;
* geldi (S/He came, I know it for sure
S/He probably is still here)
* gelmiş (S/He came, I learnt it not by witnessing
But the source is probably right)
* geldiymiş (Someone said s/he came, I dont know
* gelmişmiş (Someone said s/he came, I dont believe them
* gelmişti (s/he was here, but might have left
* geldiydi (I know s/he was here, but might have left
In Turkish, we have "Afiyet olsun" and "Kolay gelsin".
Afiyet olsun: It's like "bon appetit" but not exactly the same
It is more like "I wish this dish brings you joy and health
" I believe its origin is Arabic
Kolay gelsin: This is what you say to someone who served you in some way
Like a waiter, bartender, garbageman etc
It roughly means "I wish what you're doing won't tire you much". You can also say that to a random person working like a construction worker or a janitor
I use this phrase a lot and it's driving me crazy when I am abroad as there is no translation
Turkish has gender-neutral pronouns, which I believe to be one of the best features of the language
For example, all the third person pronouns in English (he, she and it) correspond to “o”.
As it is becoming more and more accepted to use “they” as a third person pronoun to avoid referring to a gender or sex, I truly love how that distinction is being naturally averted
japanese doesnt have R or L sounds
it has (R+L)/2 sound
therefore, they cannot differentiate R and L sounds while speaking foreign languages
Also, We don't have grammatical genders
We basically say "O" for 3rd single person
We have that in Turkish too
Depending on the social demography swear words changes
Thats pretty common
cık,
kind of click-ish sound is also existent here
I guess we're talking about the same sound
u/AllinWaker Very interesting questions, thanks
The reporter almost always uses -di to create a credibility
But if they are spessifically mentioning that it is a gathered knowledge, they use -miş. Same with politicians
The person being interviewed will use one of them casually and accordingly
In science, it depends on the person speaking
A researcher who is qualified on the topic will use -di
-mış will be used for topics one does not fully comprehend
In religious stories, -miş is used in my experience
But if the event is being explained in perspective of History -di will be used
In storytelling, just like english, many tenses can be used
If it is an obviously fake story like a fairytale, -miş should be used to get avoid the guilt of lying
This is for what I call "Big city dialect" which is a mix of many others
I believe it varies depending on the region, but I know it applies for South Western dialects
- I've never been to any religion related place, Ive never read Quran or Bible etc etc-
But afaik its "geldi
" for religions as one believes its true cause they believe with their whole heart
Agglutinative gang
Yes, snow example of you is perfectly right
And now you're confusing me
But imagining a reporter speaking with -mış, just feels off
Same for a science or history textbook
They did not see the Big Bang or evolution happening
But a scientist does not use -mış, eventhough logic should work the same with "kar yağmış".
AHH NOW I'VE GOT IT: When we use -mış, it means "I am a secondary source, believe if you trust the source". They don't use -mış, so they mean "I am the source, believe if you trust me". In "kar yağmış", they dont imply a lack of credibility because you can also gather the same info easily
Turkish here, we abolish that few years before
That's horrible in winters, especially if you live in the western parts of the country
Daily life in Istanbul starts before the sunrise
Students go to school at dark, and employees do not see sunlight in a day except the working hours
Also, illumination during the morning increasing the electricty bills
Bad decision
We did that a few years ago and you will really miss the sun
I used to say same thing before my country abolish it
It's not how it works in winter:( Many people cannot see sunlight when they coming back from their work
Also, students have to go school at dark in the morning
Most of Turkey is in GMT+2 anyway
I don't know why our government decided on GMT+3
Even Syria uses +2
We love animals
You can see bird/cat/dog houses/foods everywhere in İstanbul
Domestic cats' original habitat is Anatolia, Turkey and today you can see cats everywhere you go indoors and outdoors
There's even a subreddit for them [/r/TurkishCats/]
Despite still being high, smoking rates in Turkey have gone down significantly in the last 20 years
They were 38% in 2000 and went down to 27% in 2019
High tobacco tax, ban of smoking in indoor places and anti-smoking ads have all helped
We were the second humans to ever build a city and establish ourselves
Those ancient Turks were called Çatal höyük.
While the wild habitat of the domestic cat is Anatolia in Turkey
Now I want to get in jail in Germany, then try if I can escape from it
Then I guess I have to flee somewhere they can't find me, any ideas
Paris or İstanbul
I really think İstanbul would be chaotic enough for a gta game
Civilian motor vehicles are not allowed on the islands
But I agree with Istanbul wholeheartedly l, not because it is my hometown, but the crime, corruption, social satire, crazy driving, beautiful sceneries, hoods that look like shanties, glamorous Bosporus mansions, country clubs are all there
Ideally, you would start in the one side and then the other side of the Bosporus gets unlocked
A good writer might be able to write the best GTA game in Istanbul, and I played all the GTA games over and over again
Definitely would be amazing
Istanbul’s historic areas are very small when compared to the rest of the city, and they are mostly accessible by car
Our taxi drivers usually take the long route and show off the city
Thats is how the taxi driver goes to retirement
If they speak English, it's a tourist trap
Especially for restaurants
Ironic, isn't it
Taxi drivers, they just make your way longer to take more money
You lose more money and arrive your destination later
Sometimes they even tryna trap local people if they don't know around very well
The only affordable places near Raekoja Plats are probably McDonald's and Hesburger
Taxi drivers got Uber banned in Turkey
They are truly sons of bitches
My recommendation for tourists coming to Turkey is to use BiTaksi for at least checking how much the fare is beforehand and using Google Maps or Yandex Navi to avoid taking the long way
The problem with Turkish taxis isn’t the price or the convenience, but the drivers are not vetted so at any time a junkie can be in charge of your life, and the taxis are awful as well
No leg room, smell, etc
You cannot use Uber, they pulled out of the Turkish market
Instead, use BiTaksi to call a taxi, they are rated at the end of the trip like Uber so the experience is overall more positive
Always use a navigation app
The good thing about BiTaksi is you know the approximate fare beforehand if you enter the address, and the address is forwarded to the drivers phone so only minimal interaction is necessary
, and you can pay with your CC
All ride share apps are banned, it’s either a taxi or public transport
I don't like watching football or eating kebab
I don't have relatives in Germany
Oh and, not an avid tea drinker
I don’t like football that much but I do fit in a national cliche
I have relatives in Netherlands, France, Germany and USA
I drink 5-10 glasses of tea in a day
In fact I am drinking tea right now
I am a Turkish nationalist
Feels too fatty for my taste
I'd rather have a ribeye steak or fish
Holy shit
How people write the letter "a" with their hand
Varies, mostly **α.**
In mathematics
"a" for most equations, α for geometry
Writing “a” in handwriting seems pretty difficult to me and I know only one person who writes “a”
I do wish they were joking sometimes but the truth is something is really wrong upstairs
Look that was all janissaries fault ok we won’t have independent armies this time only state army
We tried it and it didn’t work
Too much fat in the foods, my body almost wasn't able to consume the fat
There is a tunnel network under Istanbul that connects the whole city
There are some known entrances but some of them are under some normal houses or are just hiding under some foliage
No one exactly knows where all of the tunnels are
There are some tunnels that just a few locals know about
Also, the studies about the places are mostly in Ottoman Turkish and are kept secret
*Hayli* in Turkish (pronounced "highly") means *highly* for some weird coincidence
*Yabancı* in Turkish means foreigner, comes from the root *yaban* meaning wild
*Yabanjin* in Japanese means stranger, perhaps with wild qualities
Although the two languages are of the same greater language family, it is unlikely that these words have the same origin
We say *pisi pisi* to cats when we call them
Its pronunciation is so similar to English word pussy, that means cat of course
*Malaka* in Greek means asshole, dickhead, stupid, sometimes ignorant person
And Turkish word *malak* means idiot in street slang
Tho they are absolutely not related
In turkish
Pil = battery
Hap = pills
I just had hard time memorizing and confused
I think it literally came from english
It actually means young buffalo
According to TDK, it's Persian
It did not
must have
Greece, Italy, France, Spain, Austria, Switzerland
I like mediterranean and mountains
Austria ,Hungary or germany .they has beautifull roads
Mate, I want to live in Northern countries because I love cold and dark weathers
No, but I always get nervous when my mum talks about Arabs around Arab tourists
Geez, that must've been embarrassing as fuck
Iceland being far away from everyone else is what I like about it, lol
Few years ago I've learned that there are more than one standart deck of playing cards and the one I know was French deck
Never seen any other deck irl
Not just seniors
I think everyone should periodically
It might be more frequently after 70
Below 20 is chilly and I’ll wear jacket
Below 15 is cold, I’ll wear a thicker jacket and maybe scarf
Below 10 is very cold
I’ll wear a thick coat, maybe some hat and scarf
Below 5 is deadly cold
I’ll wear the thickest clothes I own
Below 0, I’ll wear nothing because I’ll be under my blanket in bed, not going outside lol
I second this comment
Strange to see some people are
Being brave
There's also a phrase that I love so much:
"If we built a statue of this guy, there won't be enough  concrete to build his balls
Or we just yell "THERE ISN'T ENOUGH CONCRETE" when someone does something brave
We have an idiom that goes like "if we builld a statue of him, concrete we have won't be enough for his balls" that means he is a great, awesome, clever, brave, trustable person
Badass in Turkish
*"Heykelini diksek taşaklarına beton yetmez
"If we erect his/her sculpture, we won't have enough concrete to fill his/her balls
"Heykelini diksek taşaklarına beton yetmez" (There wouldn't be enough concrete for his balls if we tried to erect a statue of him) is a semi-popular saying used for chad people (internet slang word one, not the country one)
Being brave, it can also mean that someone is successful or manly
Sometimes it gets specific like that guys balls weight 50 kilos
It's used for praising people you admire or feel thankful
Heykelini diksek taşaklarına beton yetmez
If we made a statue of you, we wouldn't have enough concrete for your balls
Is a weirdly common sentence close friends use when the other makes a nice gesture
Friend took care of your work so you could have time with your girlfriend
This is what he is gonna hear next day
Having big balls also means being powerful in a modern world sense
Business men with lots of money and connections are people with heavy balls
I’d say it is “with balls” instead of “big balls” but I suppose if someone is reeeeaaly powerful it can be “ with big balls”
Just turned 18 this year and for next elections anything but the current goverment is ok
Turkish youth smokes a lot, it’s considered a “popular” thing to do and so do a lot of middle aged people
Turkey
Idk percentage but in Turkey they raised tax for tobacco products changed packs to black and put disgusting photos and they banned to sell rolled packs of cigs(they used to sell in tobacco shops it was about 1/4 price of market ones(5₺) ) I was going to buy one back about one month ago but I couldn't afford pack and rolled ones are banned
Market ones are 20₺ (2
3€ )and  5₺(0
5 €) for pre rolled ones I know it sounds cheap but since our economy is 'very good' our minimal vage is 270 Euro it is like you know unsettlingly high for a 17 yo student who tries to survive with 50tl a week
I wish man but I am sure he isn't going to get elected next time but I am worried about who is going to get elected after him it could be worse
I know right it is surreal I was going to buy a pc back few years ago and able to save 3000 tl but it just melt down there
Pc parts prices got insanely high(due to exchange and demand) average pc that will stand me for 5 6 years costs 7-10 k now it is about 3-4 times my dad's monthly income :')
Thank you man best for me is work hard and immigrate
Und ich lerne Deutsch im die Schule
Guten Tag Kind stranger
Man thank you so much have a great day
"So you guys are Arabs right
"Can women even vote in turkey"
Turkey is not an Arab country
Yeah same story with Turkish too
We call it Hollanda
I did not know that Turkey has the most ICU beds per capita in the world
Hope it can save us :(
Portakal in turkish
You never get used to it
Cruise ship intensifies
Unfortunately this looks like an error
This [Wikipedia source] from Ministry of Health Lists lists a total 38
098 ICU-CCB beds, of which 12
402 are newborn ICU units and 1
625 are for children
I'm not sure how the average numbers are calculated, but I'm pretty sure they don't include the newborn units
Still Turkey seems to be one of the leading countries with these numbers
And do sanctions ever work as intended ?
all you do is crippling an economy leading daily life folk to suffer more while the head of the state is gaining more bullets for his "look they are all against us, give me more power so i can protect you" rhetoric
According to this Turkey has 47
You had me at chai
I don't think it is less than 10%, but it certainly is lower than 50%. It seems more like 15-20%
My guess would be around 5% goes topless in private beaches owned by hotels
At least it was more common to see topless 10+ years ago than today
I wouldn’t say there are any woman who dares to do in Public Beaches and some idiot would call the police
In Turkey, i didn't see a single  one sunbathing topless anywhere my whole life
We used to play with legos all the time with my siblings when I was a kid and we weren’t financially great
Sadly, it’s more like an upper class toy now
I’m pretty sure the third one is some drunk Scot swearing at my mom
This video itself is a goldmine but except that, our former First Lady once mixed up "lawmaker" and "lovemaker" while giving a speech
Idk if that counts
The "have you ever had a dream" kid grew up
Who knew
I speech kürsü, one minute
It didnt happened
I swear
They were just playing dead
Nothing kardeş, it's always been fine and orderly in Türkiye
well some armenian stuff
but ragnar was such a cool guy
On which both Greece and Turkey agreed on
Without the exchange, Northern Greece and Western Turkey would have quite a lot of Greek/Turkish-majority areas
I'm not saying it wasn't fucked up, it destroyed families by forced deportation, but I think neither Greece or Turkey wanted to deal with even more racial conflict
It's kind of ironic since Turkey is a nation of genetically mixed Turkic speakers
In my honest opinion, it's a shame we don't have better relations with our neighbor
Considering we lived under the same government (no, I do not consider the Ottoman Empire as Turks in the way modern Turkish people are) in the same geography, there clearly is a shared culture, not to mention our phenotypes being virtually identical
Talking to Greek people abroad gave me a more familiar feel than I expected
For example, it's not that Greeks are stealing Turkish food, they've genuinely been cooking the same food alongside us
That being said, Greeks and Turks get along much better face to face than what you might see on the internet or politics
It's sort of an inside joke at this point
Nevruz
Basically the Indo-Iranian spring and fertility celebrations
[Hıdırellez] the coming of spring on 5-6 May
In the city it's not celebrated as much but the people in our neighborhood at least light a bonfire that we jump over for good health
Also we leave a wish on or under a rose bush that night, then take that wish the next morning and drop it in water
There's also the tradition of the evil eye where people use a nazar amulet for protection from jealous people or bad luck
You can see it on buildings or on people, most often children
The ones you wear look like [this]
I think it's fine, sometimes protection isn't the sole reason
We have a nazar themed decoration on our wall at home and it's mostly there to look pretty
It's not a very serious thing :)
A Turk who doesnt  like tea
A Turk who doesn't drink tea
A Turk that does not eat yogurt/drink ayran(drink made of yogurt)
Unless they have lactose intolerance
Same for a given Turkish person, I guess
Turkish tea in particular
What was Wenger doing, bringing on Walcott that early
Turkish doesn't have a gender system but in Turkish mythology/fairy tales, the Moon is usually depicted as an elderly man while the Sun is depicted as a young woman
Grammatical gender doesn't exist in Turkish language
There are no articles such as der, die, le, la etc
He-she distinction also doesn't exist
As far as I know Hungarian and Finnish are the same
Turkish has no grammatical gender, however in Turkic mythology Moon is male (Ay Ata) and Sun is female (Gün Ana)
It's just Ay (Moon), and Güneş (Sun)
We don't use "the".
Our words aren't gendered
He/she, her/him are the same word in Turkish
But in the old Turkish religion, god of the moon (Ay ata = father/grandfather moon) was a man and the goddess of the sun (Gün ana = mother day) was a woman
No gendered articles in Turkish
That concept is alien to Turkish speakers
turkic mythology\*
He/She/It is just "O".
Yeah Suleiman’s and Fatih’s periods are considered golden age
in 2008, i was 13 back then
my family decided to let me go to the UK all alone for a language school in summer
i got lost at heathrow airport, i followed my gut feelings and called my parents since i got so scared at that moment
they told me to "find my way" and they hung up the phone, i eventually cried more lol
thank goodness i found my way though
when i think back i think it's stupid but it's kinda reasonable since i was 13 with no guided teacher whatsoever
i was also robbed and harassed in lugano, switzerland a couple years ago, that memory still doesn't go away from me though
that man had the audacity to kiss me from my cheek and grop me IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET while robbing me
gross
the last one got me especially and the strange thing is that police didn't even care so i really had to let it go, it's so sad but nevertheless switzerland is lovely
after that time i started to be more cautious since i often travel alone
agreed
it's not your fault, no problem after all
no place is perfect so, besides that event i loved switzerland
In my city
A few months ago there was a nuclear material trade
In my local park some mafia tried to get his hand on enriched uranium
In that night police came and subdued the material
They handed 389 million euro worth of material to usa embassy
My town is a little student town next to the university of 27000 damned souls
Recently our local municipality decided to greet new student with a billboard at the entrance of the town
The thing is one of the people in this said billboard is none other than Selena Gomez photoshopped into wearing a turban
No one knows why they did that
Why they picked Selena Gomez And why made her wearing a turban
We are not sure what is real anymore
Send help
[The billboard ]
Datça is very beautiful
But it is kinda hard to get to so tourists dont really go there
It also has a beautiful ancient city called Knidos
It depends on your field and where you're working
Africa
French
Latin America
Spanish/Portuguese
Central Asia or the Caucasus
Russian
Well, most of secular Muslim countries drink alcohol
Yes, and I don't think any of us thinks that they are Nazi
Yeah, same
It's an obvious political exaggeration
Do you seriously think that Erdoğan believes what he said
And yes, after he said that some Erdoğan supporters could believe that but it is nothing more than 'Germany bad', actually
When someone reads your comment he or she could think that some people in Turkey really belive Germany is still ruled by Nazis or something
(That's what I did understand) Maybe you can change it to " Germany is accused of behaving like Nazi by Turkish President
There is not most hated but we can give a list
For Me:  Erdogan&Adnan Menderes
For Nationalists: II
Abdulhamid (most of the islamist leaders)
For Islamist: Atatürk (he enden caliphate and declared secularism)
For Commies: Every Ottoman sultan, all nationalst parties and also all of the political leaders turkey ever had
For Europeans and half of the Turkey: Erdogan
For Pakistan, Egypt and arabic states: Also Ataturk
For Liberals: All Coup Leaders
For humanists and armenians: Enver Pasha
Sultan 6
Mehmed, Vahdettin is hated because of his collobration with allies
Atatürk probably
Islamists hate him a lot
(He made Turkey a secular state, demolished caliphate and modernized Turkey
) to them, he basically make people irreligious, changed the "magnificent"(!) alphabet and westernised country
everyone except Islamists love Atatürk
(Me too)
as a turk all coup leaders is bad
+add me to
for all you confused people out there, islamists and muslims arent the same people
Nah 60's one was good also it was necessery in 80's the stupidity of the politicians caused the coup
Fair enough
What about Metaxas
I personally like him since he criticed the asia minor campaign
Happy cake day
i think democracy is best way . if people elect bad president ,this is fate of people
army cant invade politics
kanka bence halk kotu lider secsede onlarin kaderi ordu karismamalj her şeye
eskiden ordunun siyasete karismasi gibi sacma bi dusunce vardi 5 cumhurbaskani darbeciydi 12 mart falan ... belki fahri Korutürk yerine cok iyi bi lider geçecekti bunlar ulkeye hizmet yapmadi geregince bence
Totally right for "the Republic of Turkey" but about todays "Sultanate of Erdogan" i can't say same
Aga tabiki demokrasi en iyisi
Tüm darbeler ülke yatışınca demokrasiye devrettiler zaten
Ülkedeki karışıklıktan dolayı seçimde net iyi bir liderin geçeceğini ise hiç sanmıyorum halk tamamen bloklaşmıştı. Darbe elbette iyi bir şey değildir ancak ülkedeki aşırı siyasi kutuplaşmanın bizi götüreceği yer daha da kötüdür. 80 darbesini ben de pek sevmem 80 anayasası aşırı katı idi çünkü ancak 60 darbesini canı gönülden desteklerim
60 anayasası Türkiye Cumhuriyeti tarihindeki en özgürlükçü anayasaydı.
Grammar is hard, really hard, unless u are Hungarian
Pronunciation is also hard too
Its difficult for a lot of people to pronounce letter like ö, ü ı and especlcialy ğ. Germans can easily pronounce this letters but u can hear that they are not Turkish by their accents
Turkish is a soft language
And if an Italian or Spanish would speak Turkish they would sound like a Turkish person if they can handle our letters
Turkish is a non-indoeuropean language so for Europeans,learning turkish can be difficult
I haven't a non-native friend but in TV shows there are many foreign person and they really can speak fluent turkish but still you can probably understand that he/she is foreigner
Happy cake day
agglutinating for life bro !!
Yeap, a lot of our words also similar
For example Elma in Turkish and Alma in Hungarian
And for your information, we view Hungarians as our brothers
We all come from the same place
We are all children of Atilla
Love Hungary
That its agglutinative language
Its the most important thing that people with indo european language group struggle with
You can express a lot of things just by one word
For example göremedik is we couldnt see it
You must learn the parts that you add to the ending of the words
But if you learn that its very easy
We are not related with Hungarians we only lived closely in Asia
We VIEW them as brother
We come from the same place(ASIA)
Asia is pretty big you know its the biggest continent and Hungarians dont realy consider us brothers anyways so no reason to consider them as our brothers
Kardeşim neden bişey bulmaya çalışıyosun
Yazdım gitti tamam boşver
Yes but I don’t think we can while people are working 6 days a week for 12 hours a day for minimum wage
Turkish Economy is not at its peek thus this developments will not change by then
But this can be implemented to many areas with low circulation of people
For example universities
They work around 40-48 hours a week
No, but other Turks might like the idea
Friday is the 'sacred day' for Islam
So having free time on Friday would make it easier to go to the mosque for certain lot
Sorry for what we did
It's not in the example, but I think it fits the question
Turkish and Azerbaijani are quite similar
As a Turkish, I can understand at least 90% of an Azerbaijani text, but it's tiring because of their slightly different alphabeth and some of different words
It sounds like a heavy Eastern accent when listening
It's harder to understand (max 50%, but it's personal)
However, people say you can get the language few ours after landing to the Azerbaijan
As I heard, while listening Azerbaijanis understand Turkish easier than we understand Azerbaijani
Our news channels are in love with Trump and few minutes are reserved everyday about “Trump did/said X” and it’s the most comical part of the news
Usually it was only military activity and the important stuff
US navy hits Syria, gay marriage is allowed etc
Ever since Trump, its every fucking thing
Also they air a lot of footage of Americans being ignorant, not wearing masks and shit, so people here can feel better about themselves
I read the news a lot so more than daily, but between daily and weekly on TV
Not as much as other commenters but I figure that’s because there’s so much going on in our own country
Daily I think
Even if there is nothing big to report, it’s usually an “american cops murdered a black guy again”. Takes the heat off our own murderous cops if nothing else
Everytime
Your president is not stoping
Even in the elections your politicians msking us a propaganda vehicle
For me as a Turk Trump is not a bad president in the outer layers he seems outspoken against middle-eastern terrorism and Chinese influence games
Those are things I hate especially the CCP but Trump then talks incredibly tough but does a worse job than Obama
It’s unbelievable how much influence China gained during his rule while it was literally one of his focuses to stop them
Also you know we got our guy which might not seems as dumb as Trump but he certainly caused as much pain and suffering to our nation as Trump did to yours
I wish Erdo was little more comical but he is just cringy with his cat moustache
Greece and Russia
We came fam
Wait no more
Hello γείτονας :)
I'd say greece and belgium
oh why Turkey
We are Hunnic brothers aren't we :(
Not rivals
Even the most of the islamists are hating them
There is a little racism issue towards arabians specially syrians
Belgium ?We never went to war with them except ww1 we went to war with russia like 13 times
I wasn't talking abaout wars but yeah you're right
oh well bruh
But times have chaned,Suleiman is dead and we love Hungary more than ever
All of our unsuccesfull students go to your country to study medicine for instance lol
It's the actual battle royale that you're fighting against all of balkan states and your own goverment as well
Well there was no historical rivalry between Belgium and us but the Russia is the main guy who killed Ottoman
We, at least, all my friend doesn’t go anywhere but to bed to sleep
It is uncommon to sleep in shower or bathtub
Also we have 3 draining system
One on bottom of shower or bathtub, one on higher on bathtub for preventing over flown and last is in floor for if over flown happens can prevent spreading into house
I'm sorry but modern European cities are never attractive to me
I'm not going to name cities but a city with lots of big buildings are just not worth visiting imo
On the other hand, modern cities that kept their historical look are the best
When they visit İstanbul, they usually only see the historical peninsula
European side has so much more to offer than that
And Asian side of the city has some amazing places you don’t wanna miss
Beşiktaş, Kadıköy, Üsküdar all amazing towns
Kadıköy is the most I like about İstanbul yet so few tourists know about it
The historical peninsula is rich I’ll give it that but it’s packed with people so it hammers the experience
It’s crowded, loud and dirty
Although I prefer the European side (212 over 216), Asian side is cleaner and greener in comparison
And not that crowded
So I think they deserve a visit
Let me explain:
Those hotels are usually all inclusive (as in all you can eat+drink)
So, people are psychologically inclined to consume as much as they can, because they already paid for the whole package
And if it's summer, it's just too hot to go outside
I agree that it's stupid though
Also, a lot of food goes to waste because of this system
Kadıköy has nothing on Beyoğlu imo
But istanbul as a whole is becoming more and more ugly everyday
Back in mid-2000s it was absolutely gorgeous
Now it hurts me to look at the city knowing how it used to be
Istanbul's center is all historic
The mass of skyscrapers are away from the city's center
So I wouldn't count Istanbul as one of those cities
But Ankara is one of them
It doesn't have anything
It used to be just a small town in Ottoman times so there's nothing but buildings
Beyoğlu can be partially considered in the historical peninsula
And it’s becoming more and more ugly everyday as you say
Eh, I enjoy Kadıköy more too
It is the designated part of the city for progressives, after all
But it has nothing that makes you feel like you are living Istanbul
It’s very generic
Only in Beyoğlu you are able to leave a lgbt bar at 4-5 am with your friends to walk in a crowded İstiklal filled with *all* kinds of people, so that you can get some ıslak burger
Surrounded by old, beautiful architecture and new, ugly stores
That’s Istanbul
Like, I’m sure I would be having more fun in Dubai or Las Vegas for example but Sintra is a lot more beautiful
Napoli and Marrakesh stink of piss so much that it hurts to breathe walking the streets, but to me if you prefer Dubai over Marakesh, I find your taste buds inferior to mine
Kadıköy is a lot better than Dubai, though
And in the end all of İstanbul is ugly
It’s 5 mil max capacity city occupied by more than 15 mil
So that’s to be expected
Pezevenk is a pimp in Turkey, but it's something like a brave/fatherly figure in Azerbaijan
(or a businessman) There's a very well known story regarding this, when the Azerbaijani President visited Turkey in the 90's, he called the Turkish President "my pezevenk brother" (my pimp brother) in his speech during a state dinner and the Turkish President responded saying "Siz de az pezevenk değilsiniz" (You're not less of a pimp yourselves)
Azmak is "to get lost" in Azerbaijani Turkish, "to get horny" in Turkish
Düşmek (Düşmək in Az
) means "to fall" in Turkish, but it's something like "to land" in Azerbaijan
So "uçak düştü" means "the plane fell down" in Turkey, but it's "the plane landed" in Azerbaijan
Also "başa düşmək" is an idiom in Azerbaijani Turkish which is something like  "to understand/realize" But the idiom doesn't exist in Anatolian Turkish - so when you say "başa düştüm" it literally means "I fell on the head".
It was extremely confusing watching an English cooking video before learning "pasta" didn't mean "cake" in English
Meme in English  : an image, video, piece of text, etc
, typically humorous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by Internet users, often with slight variations
Meme in Turkish  : Boobs
Pasta:
Turkish: Birthday cake
English: Variously shaped dough products such as penne, linguini and so on
Snake/Sinek (Sound similiar):
Turkish: Fly
English: Long limbless reptile
It:
Turkish: Dog
English: A thing
Argh I have a ton but now you ask I can’t think of any
I wouldn't want to leave Turkey, but it looks like I'll have to due to the economy + being trans
I cant say that I do
There are a lot of problems here
Corruption, fake media, politics etc
I of course with that those problems will end
I really wish that one day I can say that I want to live in my country, but for now, no
I would probably want to move to nordic countries
I am kinda afraid too
As a Turk we face a lot of racism for things that we did not do
People hate us just because they know our government and judge us by them
I don't like living and yes, low incomes due to taxes and our money valuse is so low compared to 10 years ago, if it was like 10 years ago, I would consider it but now no
Plus the feel of being freedom is much more less compared to earlier years, there are much more reasons, like bad education system, increasing religion life style over poor areaes while youngs and young adults aren't interested religion at all
Etc
For people to compare, Renault clio 2020 cheapest 119
900 TL which is 15600 euros, and also the lowest income for workers is 2500 TL so you need to work around 50 months to get a new car
I dunno what to say if even you guys' winters are lack of snow
I probably shouldn't complain about snowless winters in Istanbul
it is rough to leave the place you were born and grew up in yes, but it is preferable to working a dead-end job
I'm thinking either Canada or Belgium, but nothing solid yet
Maybe I won't leave after all, I'll see what Turkey turns to in the next few years
I'm glad you liked Turkey though :)
Out of politics, maybe the best
Because Turkey is located between Balkans, Mediterranian, Black Sea, Middle East and Caucasus combined
You can see so much climate types in here
You don't even need to leave country unless you wanna have a different kind of cultural trip
But with politics, Turkey is a hell which is stuck between Middle East and Balkans geographically
Just think about that, i'm saying Balkans aand Middle East
This is Hellception
I wish we were somewhere more west but still in the Mediterranean area, that's far from Syria lol
too much action happening in a short period of time
1 turkish week equals 6 european months
i used to get bored a lot when i was living in japan
i feel alive again after a long period of time
to the west: the Balkans
to the east: the Caucasus
to the south: the Middle East
I'll have another location thank you very much, although the climate isn't bad
It would be nice if there weren’t so much action
If something happens in our neighbours, it effects us as well
And something always happens
Our internal affairs are also a mess
Apart from that it’s nice to have Black Sea by the north, Aegean by the west, Mediterranean by the south and Marmara in the middle
There’s just so much variety to choose from
The sea, the lakes, mountains, plateaus, historical places, the sun, the rain, the snow
We have them all
Not to mention that long range of variety is applied in gastronomy too
It would be an amazing place to live without all the bullshit
German influenced Alsace
More like extremely French influenced  Elsaß.
Turkey is a really hard country to understand
Inside and outside are really different
You have to live here for like 8 yrs (that makes 2 elections, ya know) at least to understand the whole politic groups of the country
We tried to get a democratic rule first in 1950 and the elected government ended most of the Kemalist revolutions
Then Kemalist military coup happened in 1960 and everything started to get out of control with the Soviet pressure and influence at the same time
The point is, Kemalist revolutions didnt come from bottom
They came from the top, from an elitist community to the standard people
But that is the characteristic of Turkish nation
We worship to our state
Dont rebel against it just like French or other Latin nations do
All coups in Ottoman/Turkish history, came from an elitist community
(last coup not included, they were islamist/gulenist)
Edit:But i'm sure that if Atatürk could live like 15 more yrs, then Turkey would be a paradise nowadays
>that makes 2 elections, ya know
Not anymore
Calling Gulenists Islamists is fucking laughable and there was really no evidence that they did it
tbh, its hard to survive here for 1k years
10 yrs* XD
Well, dont make it that obvious, seems like you are one of them
You can ask every single opposer or AKP supporter in Turkey "Are Gulenists Islamist
" and they will answer it like "Hell, sure" or "This is not real Islamism" XD
Demanding evidence doesn't mean I'm one of them
Yeah that's because they also hate the Gulen movement
only (old) gulenists dont hate from gulenists in turkey, i dont need to prove that to anyone
it is the most true thing in the whole universe probably
Couldn’t have said it better
In most places they aren't really popular
I haven't seen one in Istanbul
In villages they are more popular but still not that popular
I've seen a couple Lada Nivas in my mother's hometown
My uncle is living in the US and had his daughter (who is 1 year older than me) there
As such, even though she is now much more accustomed to the way things are here, my cousin was like a foreigner in Turkey
They come here every summer and her mother came too this one time (her parents are divorced)
However, her mum is a complete foreigner
She was running in a park near our house and then entered the house with her running shoes on
She was saying something to us while on the most white and expensive carpet in the house; both me and my mum were in shock
We find it rude to tell guests what they should do, so we didn't tell her what was wrong
I don't think she did that again though, she probably realised her mistake after seeing my cousin take off her shoes
Other worst part is that after coming back from living where they give away the road for pedestrian
This is how I am going to die
How in hell did she hold herself back from the terlik, I get how she's a guest but I mean the terlik is pretty much a reflex
Oh, taxi drivers in Turkey
It is usually kind of a jokely plead
They are just trying to feel more comfortable by putting you in a dangerous situation
Thats how we do it
Not a child's story but commonly assigned for kids to read: Kaşağı.
The name translates as currycomb (horse comb) and it's about a gorgeous currycomb of a wealthy family
The kids are not allowed to touch it and kids being kids, one if them takes it and combs the rocks, the well, everything
The comb is messed up and when the dad sees this, he angirly asks who did it
Scared, the kid slanders his younger brother
The father beats him up so bad that he dies sometime later
The kid regrets his actions but has to live with it
Erdogan well
He is very tall and has the biggest body mass of them all and well
No one is corrupt as he is
And carries m1 garand by his side in a briefcase
Is there a selection where I can choose I am forced to don’t belong and fit to country that I was born into
People in Turkey are very friendly
For example, you can have a short chat even when buying bagels from a peddler on the side of the road on your way to school
and people gather in cafes and chat
I remember my 7th grade English teacher from the UK telling me this lol
Can I be a part of your family
Gagauz, Azerbaijanian, Crimean Tatar are pretty easy
With some effort Salar and Turkmen are understandable too
One could also get the gist of a text in Uzbek
Gagauz is interesting as well
I found it quite similar to rural Turkish spoken in the Black Sea coast when I was there
They even say "haçan" while talking
Meanwhile Cyprus turkish sounds like they stopped when they reached the peak 60s era turkish movie dialects
I find it very satisfying and cute
Ah great
Got a question then, I'm aware of two theories about their origins
One states that they are the descendants of Izzettin Keykavus's tribe, thus the name comes from Keykavus and becomes Gagauz
Another one simply states that the word is a form of Gök Oğuz (Blue/Celestial Oghuz)
Could any of these be true
Or is there a third theory about the origins of the Gagauz
Ah thanks a lot
And indeed it seems to be quite uncertain
Our love for tea
No matter your ethnicity, religion or language
If you're from Turkey, you just lay back
And enjoy some tea with friends and family
Dancing in weddings
But not your regular dances nor specifically folk
Doesn’t matter how rich you are, or how elegant reception you want, there’s always gonna be oyun havası or halay
I don’t want that kind of music in my future wedding if it ever happens, but I know I’ll make it so because otherwise my relatives would eat me alive
Erik Dalı is the absolute worst imo
It's because Turkish Coffee is famous around the world
We introduced it to Europe after all
Tea can be consumed at any time of the day in Turkey
During breakfast, after breakfast, with a snack, after dinner etc
Coffee is still widely consumed but It's most of time treated a bit more formally
Like when you have guests, you serve them a cup of Turkish coffee
Or when you are on a date, you drink coffee
We don't drink it everytime, but we still drink it a lot
I've never tasted British Tea and I really wonder what it tastes like
We mean "black tea" when we are talking about tea in here
So any different kind of tea is a complete mystery
I really don’t get the appeal of it
And it’s just one movement repeated over and over
Am I missing something here
The absolute worst about these is your relative that you've never heard of says stuff like "Oturmaya mı geldik
" and makes you play
Respect my privacy a little lan
When someone says British Tea, we think about a yellow/brownish tea in a white mug
Turkish Tea on the other hand is served in a curvy glass and it has more of reddish color
Turkey: Döner Kebap
döner, it means "it spins", and well, it spins
they put some meat around a pole and slowly slice it while it's spinning
there are 2 options: meat and chicken (maybe more but i only know these)
DONER KEBAB
one of my favorites
I hope Turkey is also considered in this sub
It's doner kebab
I think its also pretty popular in Europe
pretty much every Turkish food is a fast food
Özür dilerim but wtf
I thought it was Turkish :)
You mean the one invented in 1972 by Kadir Nurman
Its history is much older than that
On the contrary, it is very common and they're hung for national holidays
Literally every 1 out of 5 people hang the national flag outside of their home
Turkey is a very nationalist country
You'll see people having the flag printed on their cars alongside an Ottoman era "Tughra"(the emperors signature) or the word Turuk(meaning Turk in old Turkish) spelled in old(very old) Turkic runes, you'll see it on trucks, you'll see it hanging from peoples balconies, you'll see a gargantuan flag flying in a clear area of the city
Is it annoying
Not if it is not too much
Not very common outside of national holidays though
Apart from celebrations and government buildings, people rarely hang them
[Morning in Balat]
For Turkey (imo) some would be:
Atatürk introducing the new alphabet to the public
Atatürk has so many famous photos and you can see them everywhere in Turkey, but what makes it so iconic is that this one is not from a war or a ceremony, it's just him writing letters on a chalkboard - it's often used as a depiction of the modernization period and I don't think you can find a modern Turkish history book without this photo
Of course Alan Kurdi, a Syrian child, lying dead on a beach in Bodrum
Hands up, I would say it's probably one of the most iconic photos of the decade
"Seyit Onbaşı" lifting an artillery shell
He's a national hero who sunk a British battleship called HMS Ocean in the Gallipoli campaign
Supposedly, his company was almost wiped out by the gunfire from the ship but he got up after the attack and singlehandedly fired three artillery shells (each weighing around 276 kgs) and sunk the ship
The famous photo is a recreation of that moment, but still it's probably in all history books
"Cumhuriyeti biz böyle kazandık" (This is how we earned the republic) A photo from the republic's ten year anniversary celebrations taken in rural Western Anatolia
There are bureaucrats and villagers holding a sign saying "this is how we earned the republic," as a tribute to hardships beared by villagers during WW1 and the Greco-Turkish War
"Lady in red" from Gezi Park Protests of 2013 - a woman wearing a casual red dress, carrying a shopping bag, and getting pepper-sprayed by the police
Hrant Dink's shabby shoes after his murder
He was a loved Armenian-Turkish journalist and there were huge protests with the slogan "We're all Hrant's, we're all Armenians
" all around Turkey when he was murdered by an ultra-nationalist
"Ekmekli Dede" (literally the grandpa with bread)
An old man (Eşref Cengiz) carrying bread loaves while crying in front of a collapsed building which killed 50 people
It might not be the most iconic photo overall, but it's always the first photo the media uses when a natural disaster happens
The picture was taken moments after 1999's Düzce Earthquake and it was the second massive earthquake in the region in 3 months
The quakes destroyed parts of Istanbul and neighboring cities, killed tens of thousands of people and led to the worst economic crisis in the history of Turkey
A small shop owner throwing a cash register to prime minister Bülent Ecevit during that economic crisis in 2001
It's really, really iconic but it's a 10 second video, so I guess it doesn't count
The protester shouts "Mr
Prime Minister, take this, I'm a shop owner
Any photo of [Mustafa Kemal Atatürk] obivously
The mindset
The only people I've encountered are nationalists and as soon as the conversation gets political they're either supporting the police, standing against gender equality, swearing at an ethnicity or denying a genocide
Besides the most practical things, I really hate that no one in This country cares for aesthetics
No, I am not talking about being pretty or some human shit
I say that about anything else
Our shitty apartment buildings, our shitty parks, our shitty roads
If you go into a house of someone I give it a 90% chance that their living room looks straight out of 2001
And the thing is, they aren't even aware of how bad and outdated it looks
Look
Dont comment at me "but people can't afford shit in Turkey" because I know
But I also know "bad taste" isn't a prerequisite for being poor
A single fucking frame on the wall that has a decent cheap print of art straight out of google images will make your living room look 5x better
Stop white-washing everything
We don't deny anything
The historical facts, the laws, the highest court in EU says otherwise
Make your damn research before you jump the bandwagon
None of the reddit users have the credibility, knowledge and expertise in this area than Bernard Lewis for example
The announcement of the military coup on state television
The commanders doing the coup stormed the state television , and made a reporter read the announcement live, on gunpoint
It was the creepiest thing i have ever seen
Link (its in turkish) [
>Finland is quite a militarized country when compared to other western countries:
Being totally neutral is hard
It has some cost
The reward is that almost nobody call you evil because of a war crime thats a big gain
>The reward is more about not being dragged into someone elses wars
Turkey experienced that in WW2
It is still seen as a wonderful choice by the majority of people
>This might come as a shocker, but neutral countries can still commit war crimes and be called evil
True, but at least you won't be treated same as an invader
In Turkey people use 'arşın' for agriculture measurement and a traditional unit of area unit which is called 'dönüm'.
1 arşın² = 0,57417 m²
1 dönüm (ottoman standard) = 919 m²
1 dönüm (modern standard) = 2720 m²
There are some unusual ones that are not used anymore by the general public like: Urup, Kirah, Cerip that were used in different sectors during the Ottoman period
However units such as ayak (feet) and parmak (fingers) are still taught at elementary education level just to give an understanding of the old school measurement systems to kids
Not at all used afaik but there is “Karış”
Which is the strechted  length of you middle and thumb fingers .
There are two that are still in use afaik
* **Dönüm** - 1,000 square meters
Very commonly used for land
* **Çeki** - 226 kilograms
Only used for measuring wood
Not common

Isn't it a natural hot spring
Well, TIL
Agreed on the second part, the whole country is breathtaking
Can I say studying
I mean it is part of culture at the end
Until 7th Grade, I was loving studying learning new stuff everyday, getting better understanding the world, my country, my culture
But Since 7th until end of 2nd year of university
Due to education system, my life just turned into you memorise these so you will be in the best high school in the city
During 6th, 7th and 8th grade, we had to take exams at the end of the year and summary of those number will made up for you to choose high school
Which I was in quite successful one but in this high school, we were forced to chose one type of programme which is similar as classes being chosen in university
We had 3 subjects and one option to each as Math, Balanced and Literature
I have chosen Math because I wanted to be an architect
Which instantly turned out, you have to study Math and Science(Physics, Chemistry and Biology) to get into this university
Which I have to placed in at least 80,000/2,200,000(the year I have taken the class) people to minimum to enter to private university with around 25% to 50% scholarship
So I just studied but not learnt until the exam years
Everyone was trying to learn short cuts but not the actual way to learn it forever
At the end, because i didn’t spend too much time with Turkish Literature I was in 70,000-80,000 which I went to university with 25% scholarship
In these 7 years, I have lost too many time from my teenage years which I would have learnt, practice, change about myself, etc
which has come out at second year of architecture studies where I was used being told what to do which made my worst semester of my education years and let me realise what I have been doing
I have failed 3 important classes that semester
During winter break(ours was 7 weeks long) I have restudied first and second year again to get rid off what I have being doing to succeed
I happy now that I have gotten rid off this part of my past
And still worries me that our education system is worse than when I was studying which was the last years of our highest education have became
After watching Djam I realised how much I love rebetiko too
Thank you
I was and am still enjoying what I am doing
It was a must for me to do it
The worst part is that I will not regain confidence over my decisions until I am sure 100% about it
Old system was designed to progress you but you know someone needed idiotic system for their relatives to pass exams
I don't care what brand, I want Taco restaurant chains
Obviously there aren't any Mexicans living here so there's like only one Taco restaurant per one major city
And they treat tacos as some luxury food so they're expensive as hell
We dont use both of them
We use it as just mail instead
Germany (our ally from WWI)
Russia (Ottoman's enemy for many centuries)
Iran/Persia (we had same ambitions for middle east)
Great Britain (WWI and they always joined our Russia problem)
Greece ( Aegean Islands and Cyprus disputes also population exchange issue)
Byzantium
Austria - Hungary
Russia
France
United Kingdom
1- Central Asian Countries
2- Greece
3- Russia
4- China
5- Not a country, but Islamic history as well
1-East Rome/Byzantine Empire
2-China
3-Russia
4-Generally Arabs
5-South Germans/Hungarians
6-*Allied Powers who tried to invade us after WW1*
7-Iran
Ww1 isn't a big part of Turkish history tho
You should change Germany with China or Austria
It should be higher
If someone were to study our history, they would learn mostly about you guys (counting the eastern roman empire too)
Germany is not relevant except ww1 and studying Turkish history won't reveal much about neither germany nor uk
We are learning about Macedonians, Byzantine and Modern Greece actually
Wow how did you get that idea:) Didn't we establish our republic after ww1 and our history lesson's biggest part is that transition process
But If you say Germany isn't that important yeah maybe you're right
Yes ww1 have a huge role in early modern Turkey but nothing more
At least it's less important than (minimum) 600 year-long Chinese rivalry that caused Islamisation and mass migrations into Anatolia in the first place
Not to mention The Barbarian İnvasion, or first and more than half of our historical data were learned from Chinese sources
I mean belgium did not ban it just legally declared it gambling thus should be subject to gambling regulations which is very fair
Gacha games are notoriously played by tees who are very vulnerable to developing addictions
As long as the game has proper system to check if the person is adult or not and discloses the loot box rates publicly its fine tho
Year 3020, Turkey is still on the negotiation table to join EU
I'd say the European Union would be limited to Northwest and Central Europe(and Scandinavia)
Southern Europe would break apart and be in a never-ending economic crisis, while the Balkans have cycles of jingoism and relative stability as always
A stagnating Russia will be cautiously holding onto the Caucasus and parts of Eastern Europe
Turkey and Greece barking at each other without bite
Essentially the status quo with lower birthrates and economic instability
I'd say India, China or CANZUKUS would be the main power
No one is delusional enough to think we’ll ever join
But yeah, we still are candidates
Sanctions would actually might increase his influence on conservatives because they already think western nations are out to get them
It can go the other direction too of course or we might even see some sort of civil war in the next elections if polarisation grows bigger
I don’t even know anymore
I’m afraid this might make things much worse for us than just economically
I feel hopeless
I think the majority leans on pro-EU
People used to voice their wishes louder but now we don’t think we’ll be able to join at this current state, so it’s not really talked about other than a meme here and there
Now that I think about it, even the memes cooled off
I can only hope we’ll be a worthy member in the future but we have a lot to go before that happens
Most people say something like this lately and if Atatürk could see us today, he would tell us to stop waiting for someone else to save us and start changing the situation ourselves
We had our special meme genre and template called *caps* in 2010s. It was basically a red bar under the image and some text
It was pretty popular for a couple years
Fugg :DDDDDD
We also have uncle that plays with card and slaps it at the table
Inci caps, ah good old days lol
We have nice rivalry with Greece
Our culture is very similar and only religion divides us
Other than that I think we are very close with Azerbaijan and we call Northern Cyprus "our baby homeland".
Azerbaijan for sure
In fact, we call each other "two countries but one nation"
Most people would say Azerbaijan, i agree too but i am going to say Greece, we both hate and love them, its complicated
Even if we fought for years, i always saw Greece as our brother, kind of like a sibling rivalry
The fact that our culture was developed together always made me feel closer to Greek people
There's a saying we use for Azerbaijan: "Tek millet, iki devlet
" which means "One nation, two state
So yeah, it's Azerbaijan
Spain is my dream country to live
Weather is the same, people are warm like us
You also have such a beautiful culture
I don’t think I can survive most of Europe’s climate
I wouldn’t even think to call us brothers but wouldn’t you agree calling it disgusting is a little disrespectful
Yes, but it is considered “yavru vatan” - “offspring/child homeland”
So it is seen as a child of Turkey, the relationship is more paternal than fraternal
In any case I do not consider TRNC a sovereign state so even if most Turks considered it the brother country, I wouldn’t write it here
>Isn't Azerbaijan in Asia
Does it matter
TRNC is getting quite assertive in its domestic politics
So I guess the relationship might become more equal even without a solution to the Cyprus problem
IIRC they even pondered establishing their own military
Of course I’d wish for an united Cyprus in an ideal world though
Je comprends l'Espagnol le mieux, surtout à l'oral, l'İtalien plus a l'écrit
Quand au Roumain et Portugais c'est même pas la peine d'essayer y a que quelques mots par-ci par-là j'arrive a comprendre
Même si elles sont toutes très loin d'être facile pour moi
During the first night after the marriage, where the couple is expected make love; the groom's male friends slap him in the back before he enters the house/bedroom to somehow motivate the poor guy
It only happens in rural towns
There were news where this slapping went too far and the groom had to go to a hospital
Yeah
I'd have a red St
George's Cross over a blue background with a white Byzantine double-headed eagle at the center
I’m not a fan of crescent and star because of its religious meaning
It would be fine without the context behind it though
I also like the colours red and white
i think greek flag is one of the nicest among the world "komşu"(neighbour)
I like the Turkestan flag
Keep the star and crescent but make the colour blue
i think our flag kinda looks arabic with star and cresent and i know that it's not about islam at all
maybe göktürk style flag would be more fitting ideally idk
Definitely No
Even if you are 50 years old and lost your home, job, etc
the moment you mentioned something like this, your room will be ready in couple mins
Even if you are working and staying with your family, they will never ask anything like this until they need your help
Otherwise if they can, they will even help you save money that you worked for
*ENGLAND*
Yes, I moved out of my mothers house at 17 to live with my girlfriend and her grandparents
We were financially independent even at that age so of course we paid them some rent money
Not as much as a normal tenant would pay but just some to help out so we weren’t taking the piss
The difference is whether or not the adult you are living with owns their own house or not - if they don’t and pay rent then they probably could do with a little extra rent money to keep them going
Lmao
But why not saving some of it for their school expenses when they are old enough to go
Or something closer
Cats, whose native land is Turkey, in general and [Tombili the Cat] in particular
We have wolf
It comes from the First Turkic Khaganate
The Hagia Sophia Cat: Gli
She is a 16 year old cat and i think she recently got sick because she is so old
She was even petted by Barack Obama
No actually wolf is more turkish
Name one Turkish wolf
I hear comparisons to either Japanese or Latin languages
Which is fair because I agree
Well, yes
But at least it's not French
Well no offense but when I was in Poland it was sound like buzz
Yep
We all suffer from constant toothache anyway
Thank you to Greece
Even if we don’t talk or get along much(government size)
I am happy that we share things
I wish we were as used to be
But I hope in future
Thank you Poland for being Erasmus Capital for Turkish students
Germany
Glad to hear that
Thank you
Finally
Thanks for the shout out
It's very relieving to hear some gratitude after all
I understand you so much
Same in Turkey
I've never locked a door
Same in here, Turkey

Nöisz
The downfall of the value of the Lira, Erdogan telling a guy who was complaining about low wages to "go and drink tea", Erdogan's son-in-law saying something along the lines of "Let them eat cake"
We are still in the summer in October
It's like 30°C when It's noon
Penalty of living in a beach city
Damn, if Marie Antoinette heard these shits, she would definitely die from jealousy
It really is lol
Helped that he literally gave a box of tea leaves at the man afterwards
"The shopkeeper continued his words by saying that he cannot *bring bread home
* Erdogan responded by saying that it sounded very exagerrated
The shopkeeper then said 'The service sector is in a terrible state
We're in a poor position'. Erdogan told him to "Drink this tea" and gave him tea
Depends on the field of study
Istanbul Technical University, Middle East Technical University and Boğaziçi are probably the most prestigious ones in engineering
Istanbul and Ankara Universities are the most prestigious ones for law degrees
(+Galatasaray University but the language of education is French) Istanbul University (with 2 different campuses) and Hacettepe are the best in Medicine, while Boğaziçi University is the best in positive and social science degrees
But these are all free public universities and private universities like Koç, Sabancı and Bilkent are decent in most fields since they provide more opportunities than public schools most of the time
Istanbul university, Istanbul technical university, ODTÜ, Hacettepe university, Bilkent univercity
2 of these are in top 500 and others are in top 1000 universities in the world
Slovakia
No offence, but it
never comes up in news or anything
It's just there
Same with Liechtenstein
Historically, Poland wasn't around much though
Very sorry, just joking
Peach
It has the same pronouncation with "piç" in turkish which means bastard
The word peach sounds a lot like piç,which means bastard, in Turkish
A Turk commend replied with a Polish Commend
I could get vienna flashback anymoment now
Well i'll put the canons back to the garage than
Enough corrupt that you can’t ask where the earthquake taxes went since 2000(Around 30B-40B€)
Woman who asked it already under investigation
Enough corrupt that you can get more jail time just to criticise government officials than actually killing people
Enough corrupt to burn a forest to built a hotel
Resulted people to create a campaign to reforest that area right after news
Enough corrupt to changing every head state department people with support of government’s party which resulted TÜBİTAK(Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) to not to support projects which couple of months later that project wins internationally awards
This is how we lost our scientist and this is why Erdogan called our scientist to return Turkey
He promised to create same conditions
Enough corrupt that people who support AKP took crazy high amount of money from government to do job which can be done 75-80% less money if it went to another cooperation
Result was after local elections cities that changed to CHP gave out information about how most of the cities about to bankrupt
Enough corrupt that government sided TV Channel asked earthquake survivors who have to live in tent, who knows how long, this question repeatedly “Are you happy
”. They just lost their home
They just become homeless after 20 secs of earthquake
Only thing they have is blankets, a heater works with coal or wood and teapot under a tent
Reporter tries force to make them say “I am happy”.
Enough corrupt that Türk Kızılayı (Turkish Red Crescent) asks for money right after earthquake (10₺ =1,6€) to help earthquake area while they tossed tons of stuff to Syrians without asking money
This shows how AKP values more to Arabs than Turks
While Arabs didn’t call us for condolences but, even if we don’t have nice relations lately, our neighbour Greece was the one who called us right after as well as EU next
So yes, Turkey is corrupt by government side
If you are individual, you won’t see any corruption at all unless you come a cross with people who support government
edit: a word, grammar
In our country half our debt comes from refugees and other comes corruption
Everything is corrupt here in Turkey
a LOT
Economy has gone to shit, we have that dude named Erdoğan which you all know very well, more than half of turkey is currently supporting him
I just wanna leave here, HELP
>Το Ζεϊμπέκικο της Ευδοκίας by Manos Loizos
This is what come to my mind when I think of Greece
It is awesome
I would vote [this song] for Iran
>hope for peace
Yes, always
> BTW we love your music
It is nice to hear that
Btw your suggestion is awesome too
Only that the song I vote is the first come to my mind
Europeans that live in larger cities, can you describe the life in your city
Ah i wish that would take that much for me
I am considered to live close to my school but even that takes at least 45 minutes to go to with public transportation
Oh im really sad that they act like that
Im not suprised tho :/
I would say in Europe standarts cities with 300k+ populations are considered larger cities
But if you live in a city that is considered large only in your country you can still share your experiences i think
Yeah i relate to this
I hope our situation gets better as well
Happy cake day
Lisbon kinda felt like Istanbul to me when I had the chance to visit it
I wasn’t expecting it so it was a nice surprise
The trams especially make it very similar
It’s like a part of Istiklal street from early 00’s.
Bilecik does not exist
Do not listen to propaganda
Have you ever met someone from Bilecik
Exactly
The government is feeding you lies
Somebody already did French monarques so Turkey:
Süleyman, Mehmet, Osman, Selim, Murat, Beyazıt, Orhan
From the sultanate of rum(Anatolian Seljuks): Kılıçarslan, Alparslan
If you go earlier like VI-VIIIth century you have: Bumin, Ashina, Özmiş, Ishbara, Ilig, Qutlugh
(don't know if these really count tho)
About Dora, she teaches English here too
Modern cartoons do to this too much, but in 70-90s localizing the characters names were not so rare with the most known example being popeye characters
(Popeye-Temel reis Bluto-Kabasakal\[lit
rude beard\] Olive-Safinaz)
One of my favourites is Spaceship enterprise vs Atılgan(doesn't have a direct translation, has meaning between adventuresome and aggressive)
Luckily they don't do this nowadays
This is kind of odd to see
In Turkey, as far as I can remember, Dora just teaches Turkish
I always saw it as one of the shows targeted at 1-2 y/o’s because of how primitive it’s language was
Menemen is a Turkish dish, usually eaten for breakfast, which is made of eggs, tomato, green pepper, and (debatably) onion
Whether the onion should be added or not is a very polarizing topic, as you can see [here]
Should pickles be made with lemon juice or vinegar
How  [Menemen] is made
There are two kinds of Turks, people who put onions in, and people that are wrong
Lol same for Turkey we call our omelette "Menemen"
No onion menemen is not menemen, just tomato with eggs
Menemen lacks its soul without onions
Not at all, it's usually eaten straight from the pan with bread
Its name comes from the town [Menemen]
Tembel hayvan (Sloth) = Lazy animal
Köpek balığı (Shark) = Dog fish
Peygamberdevesi (Mantis) = Camel of prophet
Yalıçapkını (Kingfisher) = Womaniser of the
waterside mansion
Eşek arısı (Wasp) = Donkey bee
Devekuşu (Ostrich) = Camel bird
Denizanası (Jellyfish) = Mother of the sea
Sivrisinek (Mosquito) = Sharp fly
**"Ankara'nın Bağları" and "Erik Dalı Gevrektir"**
They are the examples of the most shitty, tortural, and low-class genre in the country
However, these two become really famous and loved by many people
Even there are videos of some Spanish people dancing with it
(what
**"Ankara'nın Bağları"** was my highscool bell-tone:'( **"Erik Dalı Gevrektir"** played in every hour in the bus when I was in a touristic trip
Definitely the new airport in Istanbul - poor transport, there are problems with weather and it costed much, much more than renovating Ataturk Airport would have
Nope
People don't care about it here
Probably due to there being no confirmed cases of the coronavirus
We haven’t have this Coronavirus Panic, yet
But in 2016 Coup, I remember my father have taken a lot of cash in case of there was ban for going out
No, we still pretend that there are no corona cases here
And can someone please explain why toilet paper of all things is the first thing that runs out in a panic situation
Is it because everyone is so food secure but anally obsessed or they don't know of any other way than paper to clean themselves if they need
merak means curiosity in turkish
Satılmış. It literally translates to "Sold
" What kind of a monster would give this name to their child
durmuş (it stopped)
In Turkey the worst name is Murtaza lmao
but why
Why are they bad
It probably stems from rendez-vous, right
I had no idea so I checked Wikipedia and the only international thing I could find was military bands
Al Jazari invented suciton pumps in the 12th century
Also the first air travel was done by Evliya Çelebi in the 17th century
Sword and drum machine also originate in Turkey
Well, Turkish ancestors who used to live in the geographic area of where Turks live now, did invent them
In turkish its röntgen too, weird
Wow swedes be smart
Bologna process was a huge step
ECTS enabled comparing credits very easily
That sucks but isn't that the university's fault
Mount and Blade series
Maybe Crysis games because the founders of Crytek are Turkish but everyone else are German
Mount & Blade series is probably the most popular one
That’s how you know a game is good
I would like to thank Greece for being there for us in our bad days decpite being our main rival country
When we had a huge earthquake Greece was the first country to send help
When Greece was occupied by Germany Turkey sent food and supplies to our Greek friend
We might be rivals, but we will always be there for each other
Love Ellada from Türkiye
I would like to thank Greece for always being there for a light hearted tease
Oh we are in the schengen area finally
Şalgam (shalgam) is a salty, sometimes spicy drink made from radish
Usually consumed with red meat
Ayran is specific to Turkey too, i guess
And Iran maybe
It is yoghurt with water and salt
Also we make Cornelian Cherry juice (got to look the fruit's English) here, it is pretty good
Ayran, yogurt water with salt basically but tasty really good with chicken meals or doner
Şalgam Suyu: Turnip Juice
Mix of water, turnips, black carrots, salt and garlic
Hot peppers if you want it to be hot
It has a bitter taste and It's most of the time consumed with fish
Not everyone might like it
Ayran: This one is more popular
It's basically yoghurt with some water and salt
It's the best friend of döner kebab
It's really tasty
Russians calling beer a soft drink always make me smile
Don’t forget [boza]
Should have remembered that there are a lot of döner restaurants around the world lol
Wouldn't say disgusting but agreeable overall haha
Wow, awesome
Same, out of 138 subs, only one of them is Turkish
I hope one day we could talk and make jokes, too, about who-must-not-be-named
We have one rn, its not taboo but you can get your ass to the jail if you do talk too much bout it
English because I like English as a language a lot
Some of the stuff you meant to hear and understand are also only understandable in English as it would lose its meaning in, say, Turkish
Besides, playing in English allows you to learn words or phrases you might have never heard of before
Not to mention voice acting
Definitely English
It makes it easier to communicate with foreign teammates and also it's hard to find reliable translations for Turkish
Always in English
Even my Steam is in English
Playing games in Turkish just feels weird
I prefer to experience everything originally
Whether it be games or books or movies
If I have the ability to experience something as it should be, I do
my language
English bcz the original is always better
No matter if they are games/films/books
Tea brotherhood
Very few
Even less so with voice acting
Nope total war and mount and blade series has the turkish language but it's quite uniqe to see a turkish translation
I wouldnt say few, a lot of games have Turkish subtitles on PC(mostly indie games) and PS4
If there isn't a offical turkish subtitle, almost always there is a 3rd party patch/mod for it
But i agree, i also use English for every game except Mount&Blade
Unfortunately, most of them are generalized and viewed as conservative, pious, and pro-Erdoganists
Most of them also do lack an adequate education (even Secondary), so their ignorance highly contributes to the existing stereotypes
If you are to visit rural areas in Turkey, you are also highly likely to witness the everlasting conflict between modernist/secularists and conservatives
However, there are also sweet old people who love to tell you their stories, how their great grandfather fought a war and etc, and complain about corrupt urbanization
Depends on the location
Sometimes they are cute sometimes not so much
Better ask the North Europeans, they all went there
Well there’s a poem called [why should we kill peasants] though
couldn’t find the english translation but yeah
I'd say Turkish, English, French and German are already quiiiiite enough
But eh
Won't stop me from learning Chinese
A lot of terrorist attacks happened and are still happening in Turkey
The most notable one for me was the 2015 Ankara bombing
109 people died and 500+ got injured that day
[Soma mine disaster] (2014) was a huge tragedy in our history
787 workers were trapped underground after the explosion, 301 of them died
It caused a major uproar because there were safety breaches
My sympathies for Lebanon
Such a sad year it’s been
i still cannot visit the place where bomb exploded
i hope we don't go through that downward spiral again
Maybe
Im really not sure
Nah that was 2016 and instead of explosions there where tanks and jets for that one
I remember my windows shaking while the jets flew above
The 2015 attacks where confirmed to be done by ISIS
Greece: Yall have an awesome history(and are really hospitable)
Armenia: Well, not a lot of Turks say it so, I'm sorry for what happened in 1915
I hope we can reconcile
Tasty food btw
the Netherlands: I love your architecture
Dutch towns look so pretty
‘the place where god has forgotten ‘(allah in unuttugu yer)
‘Bottom of the hell’ (cehennemin dibi)
"The place God forgot about":
Allahın unuttuğu yer
(Though I translated Allah as the god as it means in arabic, in Turkish it means more like "the Islam God" since there already is a word for gods in general: Tanrı)
“İnin cinin top oynadığı yer
” roughly translation is “where djinni(think as a devil) plays with a ball
” Yeah, I admit it
It is a weird saying
Also "the place where dog dies" (itin oldugu yer)
Should i give a list
we have yoghurt and turkish people believe turks found yoghurt . but in america yoghurt names is greek yoghurt
(fun fact Chobani founder is turkish )
but i believe nations cant have foods,regions can have food
we have same foods with greece and middle east
Turkey is a melting pot of culture
There are citizens from very different ethnicities
There are Turks -other than Turkey’s Turks, there are Azerbaijanis, Turkmen, Kirghiz, Uigur, Uzbek etc
Then there are Kurds with 20 million population
The other minorities include: Albanians, Armenians, Assyrians, Bosniaks, Bulgarians, Chechens, Circassians, Crimean Tatars, Greeks, Lazi, Arabs etc
Even when you’re the same ethnicity, the culture is different from region to region
After the Syrian war, we can include Syrian refugees and other Middle East migrants that followed
Turkey was already a very diverse country and it became even more in the past years
Yeah, we genocided greeks and serbians too why everybody upset with the armenian tho
Sarma - Serbia
Baklava - Greece
Rakı - Greece
Lavaş - Armenia
Pastırma - Armenia
Cacık - Greece
Yoğurt - Greece
Northern Cyprus - Cyprus/Greece
A few genocide issues with Armenia and Greece
Aegean and medditerrian sealines with Greece
And at least a hundred other things that i don't remind right now
Naaah fam they don't know reddit yet
When they learn about it i'll be fucking dead
I don't remember Jews one
We took them as refugees from iberia in 1450's. But yeah Assyrians, Kurds and the other tiny things
1804-1815 Serbians revolted for independence and the suprassion wasn't very friendly they made towers from serbian skulls
You know mate its the jedi way
Even the Kaiser Wilhelm and the Bismarck is ours xd
And you're absouletly right most of our people is retarded ultra-nationalists and their fantasy world is more imaginary than harry potter or lotr
I didn't know that but yeah we're also some kind of hitler ourselves
Of course you can't find because we sold "some" of the Ottoman Archives to the Bulgaria lol
Even my history teachers denied it and i was just smiling wondering how nationalism leaded us to rewriting the history
Yeah thats a 6D chess move
Hazır ol ya da olma, işte geliyorum
Hazır ve ya değil, işte geliyorum
"Hazır ol ya da olma, işte geldim
" is the translation from english to turkish
> I don't understand how so many Turkish citizens seem to give so much support to the current government
Neither do we
Even I can't see the reason behind that
Some people don't see Atatürk as the founder of the country bu as the "traitor" who ended the "great" Ottoman Empire
There is a lot of people thinking the Ottoman Empire was still as powerful as it was in the 15-16th centuries
Even though that was the case, which obviously is not, current situation in Turkey is not good and there are more rasons not to vouch for the current government
Economy is wretched, educational system changes almost every year, foreign affairs are not good, no freedom of speech and a lot of other things
However, the government says things like "We're very powerful", "Our economy is great
", "Other countries are jealous of us
" in public speeches and somehow, people believe
The reason is that when our current prime minister was first elected he was amazing but he definitely got corrupt over time
His supporters are diminishing and as for Ataturk he’s definitely one of the greatest leaders to ever exist no question
> Why does every single neighbor of ours is against us
Tell me about it
Most people are muslim on paper or just believe but doesn't practice
I’ll answer your question
While we are majority Muslim, we are a secular country with no actual restrictions on alcohol, and many Muslims, especially in the western areas are not very religious and don’t have a problem with drinking
That ties me to the other part, Erdogan
Like I said, a good portion of the country isn’t religious, and the other half
votes for Erdogan
This isn’t entirely true but it mainly is like that
A bit like religious people voting for Trump in the USA
Also, I wouldn’t be too afraid to go out as a woman
While our culture does have its flaws, we aren’t like the rest of the Middle East and you should be safe in most areas if you’re careful
Neither do I, pal
The beaches in mainland Istanbul aren’t really that good imo and if you want the best beaches, the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts are the best, but some of the few islands we have are a 30 minute ferry ride away from Istanbul and have great beaches
I wouldn't say amazing
He was definitely better though
Some people were still concerned because of his political thoughts which turned out to be really concerning a couple years after the election
No, of course not
Atatürk is loved and respected by the majority of the population from any kind of political thought
I should have added "Some" before "People
"Thank you for your comment, I will correct it
Wow, I thought you and Moldova were fine
And I thought Ukraine hates Russians instead of considering themselves as Russians
There are no common hatred or love towards Romania in Turkey
We are pretty neutral about Romania I guess
“Fanta” also referred as yellow cola
“Selpak” paper tissues
“Post-it” sticky notes
“Termos” flask
“Jakuzi” hot tub
“Uhu” glue
“Fön” blow drying, “Fön Makinesi” hair dryer
“Orkid” sometimes used for pad
“Tupper” the brand Tupperware bottles
“Jip/Cip” Jeep, 4x4 vehicles
In Turkey:
International brands:
Gilette: *"Jilet"* - Razor
Jeep: *"Jip"* - SUV
Chicklets: *"Jiklet"* or *"Ciklet"* - Chewing gum
(The letter *J* is not native to Turkish)
Bally: *"Bali"* - Rubber glue
Nationally:
Selpak - Tissue paper
Şaşal - Bottled water
Only orange
It’s orange flavoured, the colour is also orange but for some reason people call it yellow lol
A Slovenian friend of mine once admitted having washed his hands with the little tap inside the toilet
We use Anadolu (literally Anatolia) to refer to places that is not İstanbul, even European Turkey is included to Anadolu sometimes
We don't have word for places that is not capital tho (Ankara)
The old generation says "100 numara" (number 100) for toilets
The reason is, during Ottoman period, French was used a lot
I assume in France, toilets in hotels didn't have any numbers on their doors, therefore they were "sans numéro" (numberless/without number)
The pronunciation of sans (without) and 100 (cent) are the same so there was a little misunderstanding in this case lol
Also Turkish "Hindi" means İndian (The country one)
There is a rumor that turkeys were brought by traders coming from India through Turkey
I would say Kurdish
They are the largest minority with 18 million people
There are plenty of kurdish people in turkey
And you can see them talking only kurdish in mostly kurd areas
And i  suppose they talk kurdish in their homes as well
Kurdish or Arabic I don’t know there is millions of Syrian refugees
it's become arabic after some 7-8 million syrian refugees + their children
at least 10m people speak arabic in turkey
If my statistics are correct, about 9% of the Turkish population speaks Kurdish(native or not), easily making it the most spoken second language with about 7
5 million speakers even without English, considering very poor English proficiency in Turkey
Turkish, obviously
It's not the native language of at least 20 mil citizens
PS: Second language ≠ Foreign language
i have to disagree
people often mix kurds with zaza, alawi and other minorities living in eastern part of turkey
kurdish population of turkey is around 8 million and not every kurd can speak kurdish
Yeah i mis-read the question thanks
I taught an MS Office course at a university for about 3 years
I was also shocked by how low their computer literacy levels were
Apparently they're quite ok with user-friendly apps like Facebook or Instagram in addition to games, but they are not really able to solve problems
As a side note, they consistently tended to refuse to read error messages which were telling what to do and call me for help whenever something popped up
Hitting space 5 times for paragraph indents and 20 times for centering the title on MS Word
That's the summary of my experience
The youngest people as I observe learn thing in their own way
They are not challenged by important things like you mentioned
But my brother is 14 years old and learned needed Apple’s, Google’s and school’s ecosystem in 2 weeks with total of 12 hours computer lessons by school
My generation is not much literate in computer as younger generations are
I know how caps lock work, yet, I use shift because it is easy for me to type
Haha indeed, and it was the worst in the last 5 weeks or so when Access was the content
"Mine doesn't work
" everywhere
I can’t think of a weirdly spelled name in Turkish and there’s probably none
The way we pronounce things are exactly how we spell them
Though I would like to give some of classic foreign names’ transformation into Turkish
Jacob is Yakup, David is Davut and Michael is Mikail
I hope those spellings are weird enough for you guys x)
The name ''Kağan'' they mis-pronounce it by writing Kaan''
And, Joseph is Yusuf
Well after reading the comments of native speakers I feel good as if I achieved something big
Thank you guys
No, but planning on studying abroad and possibly moving there permanently
Biggest reasons are the education system, job problems, economic shitshow in my home country
Its called “demiryolu” which means “road of iron”
...what
Technically not “the iron road”
It's called "Demiryolu". Which, yes, means "Iron Road".
It really depends
A German or Dutch Turk wouldn't be controversial at all, while a Greek or Israeli would be very very controversial
Doesn’t your queen come from a German family originally
I mean ethnicity
Nope, newspapers fear the government here
No major ones, flair explains it I guess
Happens when Erdogan's buddies own 90% of news media
Yes
They are right to be so
Yeah, maybe
Still, they are cautious
Its not banned
You only asked a question Why people disliked lol :) no btw it is not banned
It isn't.
We don’t have that
Unfortunalety we don’t have friends,we have interests
Greece
Yup
We are fighting for like centuries but socially i always saw them as friends
I think Iran
The last major war was in 1639 and the border is pretty much the same since then
I believe the first time Turks fought alongside someone was with the Byzantines ironically but we know that didn't last so probably Arabs which started eith the Battle of Talas in 751 where Arabs and Turks fought aganist the Chinese
Thank you Tulip Brother/Sisterhood
How about Azerbaijan
Oh i forgot about Azerbaijan
They are our brothers, that is probably because they are Turks too, i am not that good with politics tho
"Queen Jadwiga"
That's King to you
I looked him up he is 196cm
I am 1
93 and I don’t like it when people are taller than me so probably not
They always say they are our brothers where in reality they brag about how their economy is better and how Turkey is a shit hole so i dont think they like us that much :d
Couldn't agree more
Can’t help it :D
Yes, because they sometimes are the only T-shirts around that are cheap
I gotta say my people don’t get sarcasm which leaves me dry so many times
Turkish people have more of a dark humour and self deprecating jokes
Lots of swearing too which I’m not a fan of
We also like to make fun of other people
I see people from Black Sea region does that a lot as I’ve experienced it my whole life
My relatives are hella mean
My old workplace was like this
Man it was hard
British humour is so good at sarcasm and dark humour, I lived there for a couple of years and people don't really get sarcasm here
Nor do they appreciate dark humour
So I find myself in an awkward situation quite often
(I hope I used nor correctly )
Ah cool
I'm really proud of myself lol
"silivri is cold
" (silivri soğuktur)
Silivri is a district in Istanbul, famous for its prison
basically prisoners of it mostly politicans and people that insulted erdoğan
when someone criticise the current govn't, this joke comes in
basically meaning "you'll need a coat, cuz silivri is cold
Best Greek singer
Armenian genocide
Pro-Erdogan people say Europeans are jealous of us (Turkey)
Rest of us are just having a laugh and use it as a sarcastic joke against them :-)
ahahhahwhah
It didn't happen/ they deserved it
Choose your line and continue
Literally yes
Yep i can not understand the politics about that goverment is trying to change the history lol
Yeah I follow some of countries politics like USA, UK, Germany and Greece
Eventually I hear about other European countries politic news
Not to be offensive or anything but out of all places, it being in Poland makes it 10 times scarier lol
Ohhh perfect
It starts in age 16, usually, for example, you father offers you for a sip
In 17, they can sell you alcohol in restaurants and 18 is the legal age
A local bistro owned by family friends
They already had very few customers before the pandemic and are now deep in debt
First name and last name with the middle name being the name of the father(if he is absent it can be the mother’s name)
You choose to keep your last name or change it when you marry and children take the last name(if parents have different they might have two or the parents can choose which one)
Father: Mahmet Kayaoglu
Mother: Zeynep Kayaoglu
Child: Veysel Mehmet Kayaoglu
I have seen cases where people have two first names and I’m pretty sure it’s legal but it’s usually happens when the mother and father can’t decide a name
The children mostly don’t have two names even in that case though they choose the one legally but use both names
Herding sheep, farming, making bread, cheese, wine
And probably dying at Russo-Turkish war several years later
i would be making kebab
"Its almost harvesting season
Depends which line of my family is considered
If it is my father's side; I would be a farmer in a small village of Kosovo called Gadima if I am not wrong
If it is my mother's side; I might have been something like a cleric or imam in western Turkey
Idk my mom's grandfather was a islamic music writer so I guess he was something like a pious man
Nice job if you ask me, probably pays decent
I guess I couldn't be atheist if I was leaving in early 19th century already
idk but it has to
yes, but not possible because our economy is pretty dependent on china
No, our economic ties to China are too large to risk
definitely, one of the things I hate most about our current government is how much they like to lick ccp's ass
Recognising and cooperating more with the republic of china is definitely something i'd support
sadly nothing
The Republic of Turkey does not recognise the Uyghur genocide
Also one of the places preferred by Uyghurs that manage to escape china is turkey due to cultural and linguistic similarities
But recently Erdogan's government decided to no longer allow Uyghur refugees to turkey and considering even resend those who came
Keep in mind that those are Erdogan's Islamist party and nationalist party-1 that "support" (by support I mean being ccp's dogs because they paid them), other parties like Kemalist party or nationalist party-2 condemn and try to inform people about this topic
He ~~lives~~ in Demre, Antalya, Turkey
P.S. But our man is dead
We just have his tomb
I can’t express the amount of times that americans (or brits) asked me if Turkey was a desert and if we really go around on camels and eat kebabs
Spoiler: we do not
While I was in Istanbul a middle aged woman asked me how could she pass to the "African side". I think she thought Istanbul is on both Europe and Africa or something
That we have deserts and camels
Spoiler alert: We do not
They’re also shocked to see our houses are modern, our skin is white and many women don’t cover up
I was working at a hotel
One of the customer asked me “I didn’t expect Turkey like that”. And I said “beg your pardon
What you meant
”. He replied that, he was expecting that we have deserts and camels, exotic houses, nearly all women covered up, men with longer beard
I guess he was upset what he saw
It doesn’t have something to do with the population but rather the geographical conditions of the country
But 83 million is a lot none the less
Even though most of it live in big cities, it’s hard to find untouched areas in Turkey
Some of our local accounting softwares were only working on Windows XP for too long up until recent years
And they were ugly af to use
This cloud system I don't know but it's a good thing so we should use it tho, our ex prime minster said
When I was a child, I closed down the bank customer service software (that shouldn't be able to be closed) in their computer by using task manager and played Pinball and minesweeper
half the country's identification numbers was leaked
Definetely "Kolay gelsin" phrase which basically means "I hope your job will be easier".
Anything involving TOKİ, which is an agency that constructs social housing
Just soulless apartment blocks
Answering the opposite would be easier to me
Most of the buildings in Turkey designed without sense of aesthetics
People find many architectural concerns unnecessary
The greedy constructors, costumers and also ideologies have too much power over architects
The main objective is designing an affordable buildings to make an huge profit
The result is mostly unfunctional, and boring looking
They try to make it more attractive by adding cheap plaster ormanents, golden color additions, unnecessary LEDs etc
**If they let you to design a regular building instead of a monster, it could be an architectural masterpiece in Turkey
** As a fresh graduated architect, I'm more satisfied to be unemployed instead of designing neo-classical shitty apartments
Yes
It's called "Religion and Morals
They primarily teach Islam and how to be a good person in general (morals and ethics)
Then Christianity, Judaism, Atheism etc
It's mandatory for all students but if your family doesn't want you to take the class, you don't have to
But most people take it anyway because It's an easy subject and it increases your average test results
I had an atheist Russian friend take religion classes just because it was too easy for her
We also have mandatory Philosophy lessons in High School
Does anyone else have them
Religion lessons exists and its curriculum and weight has increased in recent years
Religious lessons are indoctrination and a lot of detail stuff about Islam is taught
Part given to other religions is negligible
Science-denying and defamation of non-theism is prevalent
There is an opt-out for religious lessons
From this thread it seems like even first world countries suffer from propaganda in religious lessons
I'd rather say it used to be pretty much similar to the others described here, can't say it for today
Turkish schools do teach religion
It is quite annoying, as we also get tested on what we learn, and is part of our university exam
As long as society doesn't have anything against it(which they should have), the only logical answer is why not
Unfortunately yes and it’s only gotten worse
Stupid AKP even allowed girls to wear a headscarf in school which is awful because most of them are not done by choice but by being forced by religious nut parents
I’ve had many female friends who stopped wearing headscarves when they gained independence from their parents
“There is no force in religion” my ass
[Çorum] because apparently, it is the "[centre of the world]
Also, this quote also might affect my beliefs:
***“If the world was only one country, Çorum would be its capital”***
\-Napoleon Bonaparte
I want to say istanbul but it would be  strategically wrong
So konya i guess
Its was cultural hub back in the days and so it has great architecture
Chasing the European dream since,well that's not important
Refugee harbor country next door
I think it’s important to them that we don’t join but having good relations with EU is important
Our geopolitical position is the biggest reason for that
They would get 45 kilometers of coastline
Service isn't great, some patients are dicks but there are no major downsides in my opinion
Even in Turkey healthcare is better than USA
No Downsides
Some old women are using this privilege as social meetings
They re chatting, gossip, weaving and looking for a doctor future husband/wife for their adult children while waiting
Lol
>You have the highest survival rates in the world
Also less alcohol and tobacco consumption compared to Europe though
Surprised no one said Turkish
Having more than 1 third person pronoun (like English he/she/it) is still weird for me
So almost all European languages are weird
oi we heard you hate math
how bout we put more math in our language so you ll have to solve more math while doing math
Can you speak Turkish
Yes
I know nearly nothing about the 30 Years War, which is odd because my high school history textbook had an entire chapter about it
Ben de bunu yazacaktım, demek ki okul eğitimi yüzünden bilmemiz gerektiğini düşünüyoruz ama öğrenemiyoruz :)
Translate for Redditors: Came here to write this, seems like we think we should know about this but we can't learn it
we don't know about those things either lol
only mehmed conquered and won
All I know is that Sweden was involved(and its King died on the battlefield), and that
France was on the Protestant side despite being Catholic
I have no idea why my textbook had an enite chapter about it
The war practically barely touched the Ottoman Empire
Interesting
The only thing we learn about Poland is that the Ottomans fought numerous wars with them(and memorizing those treaties was a pain in the ass), and that WW2 started after Germany invaded Poland
The Turkish education system gives a lot of details and information, but it is VERY poor at explaining the wider international context
For example, while we learn that Poland fought against the Ottomans at Vienna, we don't learn *why* Poles fought there
Or why Hitler invaded Poland beyond "he was expansionist".
School typically starts at 9
00 but students are expected to be there some time before that
Lessons are 40 minutes and there are 5-10 minute breaks in between
If you have 8 lessons a day there is a 40-50 minute break after the 4th or 5th lesson
We builded worlds second submarine in 1719 and instead of using it for military purposes we used it for circumcision ceremony of III
Ahmed’s son
We became muslims thanks to the Chinese
Edit for Context:
There was that one time when a European king came to Istanbul, was given a salary(which he spent on bribing government officials) and refused to leave for 5 years until there was a shootout
He took our meatballs too
First:
Sultan abdulaziz who is the first sultan to ever visit a country abroad had a special compartment in his shoes and they put soil from istanbul in it
Because at that point, by law, any place the sultan steps on became his
Second:
During the Irish famine, for some unknown reason Ottoman sultan abdulmecid decides to help by sending 10000 pounds
British ambassador convinces him to send 1000 instead, because Queen Victoria had only donated 2000
He also sends 3-5 ships of food
Keep in mind that ottomans weren't doing that well themselves and we also have 0 relations with Ireland
They didn't even have an embassy here until 1998
Sultan Erdogan's son-in-law ran away with $128B of Reserve Bank money and people who asked about the money got arrested
Hezarfen Ahmet Çelebi (Scientist) designed wings for himself and flew for 3358 meters
From Galata Tower to Üsküdar
And he did this in 1632
Then Sultan sees him flying and decides that he is a dangerous man
Sultan forbids him to live in Istanbul
He dies in modern day Algeria
Hahahhahaha sounds like something that would happen at my job
Umm
Can I have one of those ?
We had the advantage but we ended our advantage in stupid way
In every military aspect there is an example of this
[In the battle of Talas] Karluk Turks were serving against the Chinese Army as mercanaries but China oppresed Turks at the time
However Turks had no other choice
During the Talas Battle, we changed sides and joined Abbasids because we didn’t want to be mercanaries of the China, the side who oppresed us
That battle and oppresion of Chinese caused Turks to have better relationship with Muslims and we became Muslims mainly thanks to that battle
If Abbasids never existed Eastern Roman Empire would probably be the main enemy of China and we would probably become Christians to escape the oppresion of the Chinese
That is very cool, thank you
I thought so too
It's a smart solution to a bs problem lol
An extremely disorganized ad agency
Today is the children's day in Turkey
Also 101 years ago today Grand National Assembly founded and Ottoman government overthrown
Today, the  national sovereignty and children's day
Today is the day our first national assembly was formed in 1920
such is life
If it wasnt for Covid we would normally be on the streets and joining ameteur parades
Its so fun every year
All people would bring flags and flag designed shirts and march to the city centre
This also happens on our other nationel holidays
-Loves from Turkey
Usually, children from all over the world would come in groups, visit the city, usually stay with a local family, hold parades and stay for a couple of days, etc
Its really colorful, quite fun and a unique experience for the visiting kids (probably anyways)
We don’t celebrate Christmas but what whole Europe does for Christmas, we make it for New year
So for us maybe 31st December
Absolutely
Even Greeks and Syrians, who I think look closest to Turks, can be spotted in a crowd by me
There is something distinctive beyond our hair color but I can't quite put it
Almost always
There was [this video] that I had watched
When I saw the girl, I immediately said she's Turkish
To no surprise, I was right
I guess it's because we have smaller eyes and more round face structure
I could only tell by their gestures and clothes
We have everything from blue eyes-blonde hair to dark brown complexions in Turkey
Lol sounds gangsta
I agree
I can’t put my finger on what it is exactly but it’s something to do with nose + hair + skin tone for us but it makes it so easy to spot another Turk
Though, Turkey is sooo genetically diverse that this should not be possible
Depends but i would say: Antalya, Bodrum, the historical areas of Istanbul and Cappadocia
Istanbul, south Aegean region and west Mediterranean region for resort tourism, Pamukkale and Capadocia for the geographical tourism
Istanbul, Kapadokya, Izmir, Pamukkale, and Antalya
There were a lot of tourists especially in Istanbul before covid and tourism is just a big money source for the country
Ananas aldırdım/i ordered to buy a pineapple
Anana saldırdım/ i attacked your mother
Just change the place of the "s"
Şeref siz misiniz
(Are You Şeref)Şerefsiz misiniz
(Do you lack Dignity
) (Şeref is a male name btw)
French
How do they decide whether to use "e" or  "é"?
In Latin based alphabet would be Portuguese, in the ones that I’ve tried to learn
It is like you think it is like similar pronunciation as Italian or Spanish but No they put random sh on “s” and x, ch sounds as “sh”. Pronunciation is the problem
But in every language it would be Japanese
Due to characters
Turkish is hard until it is not
i am sure this is how French pronunciation made up
same
The 'secret articles' in the Treaty of Lausanne will 'end' in 2023 and Turkey will become GLORIOUS overnight
Very Good
There are english texts in Turkish Wikipedia sometimes though
Turkish wikipedia doesn't include a lot of stuff mostly
You would quickly see the differences when you compare it with the english one
Turkish Wikipedia sucks ass
I use it only when absolutely necessary
turkish language wikipedia (vikipedi) is utter shite
few in number and unreliable "article"s.
i don't visit it
however it really grinds my gears when google just dumps vikipedi links on my searches (since my turkish ip address)
Same in Turkey
No it is not
Because we dont find it delicious and good
We would use it for tea
No it is not
Because we dont find it delicious and good
We would use it for tea
City: Too

A lot of Europeans I talk with seem to imagine Ankara as a green, liveable alternative to Istanbul however
Country: Domestic violence is overlooked a lot by the government
It isn't necessarily ignored in the rest of Europe but I've rarely seen Turkish domestic violence reported in EU  media
+ Economic and culturel gap between east and west Turkey
+Endless malign construction in Istanbul
Eeeeeeh
Most other Europeans I've talked with recognize that Eastern and Western Turkey are very different, they just don't know how huge the difference is
Honestly I wouldn't be opposed to letting Eastern regions secede, they lower our averages quite a lot
Yes but I don't think the problems will end
I was very young but I did not expect the atheists to be the majority in (western) Europe
Edit: I don't count people who don't have anything to do with christianity but call themselves Christian as "christian"
Turkey/Georgia
Don't try too hard
It's a mistake I make when I speak English
It's a mistake almost everyone I know makes
Throw some words together and native speakers will understand what you are trying to say
Also for Turkish, don't be scared by new letters
The sound of each letter already exist in your language
For example "Ç" is the sound you make when pronouncing "Ch". It already exists in your language, we just have another way of writing it down
Well speaking for Turkish don't strain yourself to completely correctly use the "çekim" ler (conjugations) as it is not just for the subject but also implies the time
This is pretty natural as our language is fairly a different language than whole European languages
Try to practice pronounciation with someone speaking the standarized Turkish by the way
Someone speaking Turkish in Edirne and someone speaking Turkish in Mardin sound very different, not delve that deep at the first turn
Other than just enjoy it
I think most of you would be interested in seeing most important part of the sentence can all expressed just by the verb
You are right
That sound confused me for a while
Also I meant in English
Sadly I don't know any French
I think thats more of a Mediterrinean thing, assuming you mean thousands of years by 'old as fuck'
Not to engage in a silly race nut there is literally a 2000 y.o. church at 200 meters to my home
And its nowhere near unique in Turkey
When you forget to close the door — “Were you born in village without doors
When you forgot something to say but you know what it is but can’t say it because you can’t thing of the word — “It is on top of my tongue” -not only mothers but universal”
When you pick you nose — “Are there excavation work going on
When you do something uncivilised — “Did you came from mountain
When your room got messy in short time like you did some project and asked your mum to clean it, when your mum sees it, she would say “Did bomb drop here
When you didn’t finish the plate, she would say “It will cry behind your back” which is makes you kind of sad when you are 5 hears old and you finish it just to not make food cry
When you do get instant karma, she would say “God doesn’t have a stick”
This is in our family, I am not sure if other families use it but if you open lights more than you need like living room, kitchen, corridor and bathroom lights are open or you make too much noise in long period, we would say “Are you signalling to astronauts
or Do you want to make sure if astronauts hear us
my mother always says:
I wish I gave birth to stones instead of you
Generally Grandma’s says this as “You left with one skin and one bone”, it means you are too skinny which is not for long after that proverb
I like how Grandma’s are bipolar when it comes to you, first they feed us until we are a wheel then complain why I gained weight
It only applies in York
Easily
I've never had a debate over how a Turkish word is pronounced
You can just put random letters together and everyone will read it the same
If you know the Turkish alphabet, you can pronounce every single word
Turkish
You'll figure out everything letter by letter 95% of the time
The 5% is when somebody uses a very old Ottoman Turkish, Persian, or Arabic-related
(we don't really have straight up Arabic words, and the ones we do aren't spelled or spoken the way it was intended to)
Yep, Turkish is 100% Phonetic
This is often true but not always
You would write "miğde" if you heard the word and never seen it written
Do you pronounce "yarın" as in tomorrow, the same as “yarın” as in indicative form of split
Same here
You write down what you hear and say what you write
Mostly yes
There are some different pronunciations from a minority of people, but most of the population will pronounce the same
They are different words
You could pronounce "yarın" as in tomorrow and everyone can write it down
You could pronounce it as in indicative form of split and everyone can write it down
But this contradicts with "throw some letters together everyone will read it the same". There might be some issues there
It's actually the same
Each letter has one pronunciation and one pronunciation only
So you can hear a word and write it down
Or you can write down a word and everyone will read it the same
If you know Turkish, so you know the difference
Obviously it would be hard for a not native language person
Le trône
(The throne)
I don’t know if this is common but my mum calls it “Taht”(Throne) as like “When will our king leave its throne
” to ask me how long will it take me to get out
Ayak yolu = Foot path (perhaps related to nature calls)
Yüz numara = Hundred number (a misnomer from French where the public toilets were numbered 00, "sans" número, heard as "cent numero", number 100)
We sometimes refer to it as “ayak yolu (foot way)” but I wouldn’t call it poetical
Never heard of it
“sıkıldım”
heheh
it can mean a completely different thing if it’s said wrongly
heh
Of course swear words like "amına koyayım",  "oruspu çocuğu" isn't it a perfect starting for learning a new language
heh
_do_ put dots over it
Kanka (It is the abbreviation for "blood brother" but used as dude or mate nowadays)
Aga (Lord/Master)
Reis (Captain)
Abi (Brother)
Beyler (Gentleman/Guys)
Oğlum (Son)
Thoose are what I recall now
**Kanka**: Shortening of *kankardeşi*, which means *bloodbrother*. We use it as "bro". Sometimes we type it as **knk**.
We mostly use
-Aga ( comes from ağa, which translates to landowner)
-Kanka = dude
-Oğlum = my son
It depends
"Kanka" is the most common, being a shortened version of "Kan kardeşi" or "blood brothers"(I think that is the literal translation
Other common words are abi(short for ağabey, older brother) or abla(older sister)
Kurds and Zaza probably have such words in their own languages as well which are probably used by Turks living in those regions
If we are calling a group (male based) we mostly use  "beyler" [Bey means some sorta sir and -ler (it might be -lar depends on the word) is plural suffix] ;if we are talking with just one friend, we call him "kanka" (some sorta bro but its different) and we also use "oğlum" [It means my son
Yeah its a little bit of weird but we short it as olm (yea i wrote it by how it pronounces) and it becomes a very different word -we mostly use this in argo]
Don't forget -je words like 'broertje' little brother
Thats also sweet
Or 'faka' for more street vibes haha
Bedankt dat je dat hebt uitgespookt
Damn that is interesting
We call Poland "Polonya" right now but Polish language is called Lehçe.
Edit: Ottomans called Poland "Lehistan" tho so you are right about that too
Rulers begin to bring everything that isn't in Istanbul to Istanbul from the newly conquered territories
This includes monkeys from North Africa
The new Sultan, Murad the 3rd, appoints a guy he likes to a high place in the government
Coincidentally that guy absolutely hates monkeys for some reason
He tells the crowds that "Women use monkeys to do bad stuff" and this gets the attention of a few monkey haters around him
In a friday, he and an angry crowd of like-minded monkey haters just say "fuck it" and he fucking hangs every monkey he can find around the city
There weren't any monkeys in Istanbul after that
Sup, Almanya
I don't say we don't have them but I have never seen the boy scouts or the girl scouts in my country
We have a lot of them, the ones in the big cities are well preserved
But the ruins that are forgotten or in small cities are usually destroyed by bounty diggers or villagers(they used stones to make houses)
It was also somewhat popular in Turkey, especially in the internet cafes
People would sit and play wc3 DotA and CS while listening to this stuff
Not so proud of it but still good memories
Why would you feel guilty for Live is Life
The fact that we won't be able to join the EU in the near future
Besides accents, the word he chooses in a patterned way of translated words from his native language makes one distinguished so i be sure
They use the most used definitions for some words without knowing its not the same thing as he meant
Yes, Portuguese are usually pronouncing “Cheap” as “Sheep”.  You end up wondering if they bought it cheap or with sheep
Majority of my whole floor was Turkish, I figured it out 2 weeks later when they spoke Turkish in the kitchen
Between these times, I spoke them in English
Reason it took me so long is that I was one of the first students to arrive and only one Portuguese that came exact same day who become a friend and start to hang out with them more
Not one letter but some dots:
Ölümlü: mortal
Olumlu: possitive
Sık-mak = to bore/ to squeeze
Sik-mek = to fuck
Sıkıldım = I'm bored
Sikildim = I got fucked
That i/ı, İ/I difference is mostly not given attention by foreigners, their pronunciations are also somewhat similar for someone who is not native and the results are quite funny when someone misuses them
Some lazy people like me writes i instead of ı in mobile keyboards and it sometimes creates unwanted situations
Poorly localised programs have this problem too
Note: It's a one letter difference in the root word but vowel harmony makes it multiple
In turkish, I'm bored means "sıkıldım". But if you are using english keyboard instead of turkish and type like that, outcome is being "sikildim" and it means I am f***ed"
It is
We call them "noktalı harfler" which means "dotted letters or letters with dots" so "Ü would be dotted U" so we see them as similar letters even tought they sound really different
We have both i and ı which sounds totally different
we use İ and i for I and i in English
I and ı is a lot different
Turkey is usually free
There are some private colleges but they also give you scholarships if you are succesful enough
If you are from a foreign country, I think there was a small fee but that is all
I think that Turkey might have the cheapest universities in European standarts
Human life, minimum wage, cost of basic living
Supermarkets have 1
5 L water for 0
13€ .
I like them, too until they act like Thor killing the neighbourhood
I like it, especially when electricity is gone
refrigerator - buzdolabı - ice cabinet
Ayçiçeği = Moon flower and the meaning of the word is sunflower
Yumurta sarısı (yolk) also translates to eggyellow in English
This didn't really work because Turkish suffixes replace full words in English
Merhaba, adım Can
Tanıştığımıza memnun oldum
Nerelisin
simple, using only word roots: Hello, name Can
Meeting pleased be
Location
with suffixes: Hello, name-my Can
Meeting-ours-that pleased be-am
Where-er-you
That last word asks which place you belong to, -er- as in Londoner
I was dreaded by the thought of doing this, thanks
Bears and wolves probably
They aren’t exactly near residential areas though
You have more chance of getting attacked by a stray dog than either of those animals
Either the Anatolian leopard or some kind of spider I forgot it's name but it's very deadly
With the humans in first place with a very large margin, third place is shared by ticks, boars, bears and wolves, all of which are challenged by [the kangal dog] as the fiercest non-human animal in Turkey
You have polar bears
I don’t know if I’m excited or terrified by the thought of that
I’m sorry but that’s so metal
Not in the EU day, but when I was solo visiting Frankfurt there was an EU event
I was passing by and they handed me a paper flag
I was happy to fly it all the way through my visit
we are
Similar situation here
It has been so overused by the right wing, flying it for no special reason is a bit weird now
we can switch our position in the continent, if you want :D
[Hababam Sınıfı] \-  Lazy, uneducated students share a very close bond
They live together in the dormitory, where they plan their latest pranks
When a new headmaster arrives, the students naturally try to overthrow him
A comic war of nitwits follows
This film created from book which published in 1957
4 IMDb rating
Everyone knows this film
It is still aired every week in some channels
This one is not universal unfortunately
It is like made for Turkish audience only
Some jokes might not make sense but it is still enjoyable film
\-edit- .[G.O.R.A.] you can try this one, it is from 2004
[The best films of all time from NTV News] for who wants to explore more
We don't have a lot of good movies so I suggest you just watch "Veda"
I am not Italian but I watched “io e te” the topic of the film was not so attractive but the scenes
They were absolutely incredible
Kibar Feyzo from Turkey
These are great movies
I'm still waiting for more from the same team
Thank you for the list
Are these all sad dramas
Can you also recommend something more fun to watch
I was scrolling with the same two movies in mind
Hababam Sınıfı series is excellent, as well as other films by the same group of actors such as [Neşeli Günler] and [Tosun Paşa]
I'd be happily surprised though if any of these films attract any non-Turkish audience
They form a part of the mythology of my generation and I love them
Although not a movie, the Emmy award winning miniseries [Şahsiyet] is totally awesome
You heard this person, Now(!), where didn’t we raid
I would like Boris Johnson to use his rightful claim to the throne of Turkey
Merkel for sure, but does not matter, most of the others would be pretty good too
Can I have Merkel
Our head of state could use cooling off a little bit
Replace Erdoboi with Merkel
She seems super cool
Also, experience in crashing the Greek economy is a huge plus here
I wish you could send her over to us when you're done, like a retiring football player
Big fan of her
The fact that we have no gender system
It makes everything way easier in my opinion
We have letter that has no sound "ğ" it's called soft g, it doesn't make any sound
I like how you can change the sentence order based on your emphasis
Example:
Ben bunu buraya getirdim
I *BROUGHT* this here
(It’s a regular sentence)
Ben buraya bunu getirdim
I brought *THIS* here
Bunu buraya ben getirdim
*I* brought this here
What you emphasise in the sentence changes based on the order
It’s quite useful in conversation
We aren’t sexist like y’all
Makes it easier to communicate with everyone too you aren’t sure which pronoun to use wait you can’t do that they are same for everyone
Oh yeah
Turkish also doesn't have he/she/it
Just use "O" for all of them
[Kinda] ğ makes no sound but it adds lenght to the letter before it
You can listen to google translates translation it pronounces his surname correctly
We guys have so much in common
I keep hearing about that our language have the same words and grammar structures with Finno-Ugric languages
I don't think it's a necessity
We usually say the name of the person who we are talking about
[Kokoreç] (grilled intestines), [işkembe] (tripe) soup, [brain salad] and probably other meals involving offal
[Şırdan] must be up there too due to its interesting shape
Also, one time I let an American friend try ayran and he almost vomited, so maybe that
Brain salad
You boil some brains in vinegar and salt until it's soft and then drain them and cut them and put some olive oil, lemon and vinegar on top and bam you got yourself some (probably healthy) brain salad
Or maybe "Mumbar". I've never personally eaten it or even came across someone who've eaten it but I think that it's popular in the southeast regions
It's made by filling sheep's intestines
Google it
I know it sounds interesting
omg covid 20 might break out from this thread
in turkey some people drinks a soup which sheep's head and foot in it
Şırdan is [abomasum] stuffed with typical dolma stuffing: a mix of rice, ground meat, tomato/pepper paste, and some spices such as cumin and pepper
i know we have pretty similar cuisine but  i was not aware of kokorec is also known in greece until now
it surprised me similarity reaches even to kokorec lol
worked in denmark for a longish period
these are my opinions (i.e. my views; let's not forget opinions are personal :) so please don't flog me)
* the climate is not as bad as the other nordics
i think, it is the best
you still have your windchill and rain but that's about it
but there is general lack of sunlight because it's always damn cloudy
the weather will get to you but not as bad as you think
a minor drawback
* cars are for some reason really expensive
a lot of people drive junkers and honestly i have no idea how they pass the inspection
public transport might be great in the capital area but if you are in somewhere like sønderjylland the public transport sucks
this means you can't buy your groceries in bulk, get ready to cycle a lot in the rain, wait a lot for connection bus/train etc
* anything that is a service is expensive
like getting a haircut, getting a taxi, going to a car mechanic, calling a plumber, delivery etc
conversely, most goods are not that expensive
alcohol, meat, various groceries, electronics etc
* it is a really individualistic society and to be honest people are not really social
this is coming from me, a guy considered almost asocial in turkey
a lot of danes take antidepressants
at least the majority of ones i knew
loneliness is an issue here
* they are not really accepting of foreigners
so don't be surprised if you end up hanging out with a mix of people from venezuela, germany, poland, lebanon, peru etc
sure you will hang out with the locals though almost exclusive to binge drinking
* the language
this might be exclusive to denmark as it is really hard to speak
i could read and write but speaking
it's on a whole another level

* you pay a lot of income tax (near 50%)
still, as net salary you are higher than a lot of EU countries

I think I'm Swede
Wow, thank God I’m not that anxious
If we worked together I’d definitely offer you tea/Turkish coffee and talk about daily things, hobbies, even little personal life details after some time
My problem is people try to talk about personal stuff immediately after meeting
You can get “interrogated” while waiting in line with other people if you try to chit-chat
So, guess we have to find a medium ground
> Kone
pretty damn good elevators though :D
We use quite a lot in messaging but not as much when we are talking but still used in talking
It's used when texting
It was rare and it used to be sound cringe
It's used more in last decade, still not very common
Depends on where
Western parts and coasts (except eastern black sea) we use it alot
> We use quite a lot in messaging
Yes, probably
"Basically the same thing all over again but we're against ourselves this time"
We won against invaders, and we are a great republic now
And another world war happened, and unlike the first, we choose being neutral
We did an operation to cyprus and we are doing many operations on syria now
Well, that was the entire story of Turkey
Or the Sørenga Marina thing
We have a county named "Of" in the Black Sea Region
It's famous for It's delicious tea and lush green mountains
It's located in Trabzon province so you can say "Of of Trabzon" lol
Of, a town in Trabzon, people from Of never say they are from Trabzon tho, they insist that Of is and should be a city
Weird people those are
Happy cake day
Happy cake day
Popeye translated as “Temel Reis”. When it is translated, it will help to intergrade to your culture
In some cartoons, The Hulk is translated as "Yeşil Dev". And it literally translates to "Green Giant".
Lol
Sounds straight out of a sitcom
I can imagine myself taking offense if my neighbor sent me a letter
Well, everybodys a little weird I guess
I remember being surprised that some people sounded much friendlier than others, couldn't tell if it was an accent
Definitely It is Ankara
Nobody likes Ankara except people from Ankara
It is called Gray City
I think it is a soulless city
The only beautiful thing about it is the Mausoleum
Turkey's capital is Ankara, it's not as hated as İstanbul I guess so it's spared
The only thing I've heard about Ankara is that it doesn't have a seashore and is too gray, however this argument is not-so-surprisingly defended by people living in İstanbul or İzmir, which is another big city and either loved or hated for WHOLE different reasons, so yeah
Woaw That is great to have friends like that
But WHAT DID YOU SAID ABOUT ISTANBUL
It is the worst SIN you can commit
Go to guillotine
The sea joke put  smile on my face
It is really rife joke amoung us
Actually It is pretty controversial
One side says it is amazing city to travel not to live
On the other hand some people love it and live there  in spite of all issues or they are dreaming to live there
And lately Istanbulites who are mostly well educated have been leaving the city due to chaos, refugees, security issues, overcrowdness, pollution
They have been going to the south seaside cities such as Izmir, Antalya, Mugla
They are seeking green, happy life which we don't have here unless we are rich
Living at (?) the Anatolian side, have been regularly coming to the European side for half a month and I'm already sick and tired of it
I've been coming to Beşiktaş for so little time yet its chaotic environment makes me want to lay down and cry
Kadıköy, however, or generally the "karşı yaka" as istanbul elitists would call it, is one of the best places one can live in Turkey
I would choose to live in Ankara rather than trying to find my way through Şişli one more time without hesitation
Enjoy the chaos
Istanbul sometimes bother me, choke me although I love the city, vibrant
Then I just fly to Antalya and enjoy the silence and heaven as well :)
I love Kadıkoy and also love Besiktas as well
It is killing me softly but what can i do :)  When I leave the city for summer break i miss it by  1 month
Sisli has great neighborhoods like Bomonti
Visit the old beer factory
I don’t know about Turkey
However, if there is a scandal, I don’t think our sheep population would force the government to collapse
They will be remain silent
And keep support the government
Not at all
We suck at foreign language education
Most people straight up have no knowledge at all
Then, a lot of people who claim to speak English suddenly freeze when it comes to speaking for real
They go "oh I can understand but I can't speak"
Hell, even university professors are like that
Must have that maybe some people have
(and speaking like a native english person is wayy more rare)
Georgia: Cuisine, especially wine
Greece: Music
I can't answer this question because of legal concerns
The president, duh
And I can easily say this for most of Turkey's population
Contain your assumptions
When I went to name my child they told me 'you can name him anything without the letters x, w, q because they don't exist in official Turkish'. I asked again, 'anything
', she said 'anything' with an emphasis
So I guess I could have named him Ferrari Jean-Claude Van Damme
Yes, there are even people named “Roket Atar/Rocket Launcher” and “Bok/Shit”
The smell of cooking kebab or doner
I might also answer "tulip smell" but for that Netherlands is more fitting I guess
I would choose one of black tea, salça, kolonya, or cigarettes
Especially kolonya
To be honest every street in Amsterdam smells weed
Hah, that is really wholesome
But on a serious note, I think it is there is nothing wrong with Netherlands-tulip thing, Turkey might be where it is originated but the country that has absolutely stunning tulip fields and farms is also the Netherlands, in Turkey a few small tulip mosaics is the max you can find
I guess just saying it is common culture for both of our countries is the best option lol
Well, to answer your question i first need to clarify a few things about kebab
Firstly, kebab is not one specific food and rather a wide term used for many dishes
(Example, [both] of [those] images are considered kebab, but they do not look alike each other right
) Etymologically kebab comes from Akkadian or Aramaic language (word origin is disputed) and means something like "meat that been cooked on fire". Of course, its modern usage is different but this should give you an idea of how wide the term is
There are a lot of Kebab types, some of them are Arabic origin some of them are Turkish origin etc, almost every western Asian country has its own traditional kebab
There is even one with greek origin but as the founder of it, Alexander Efendi lived during ottomans times way after Greek independence it never become popular in Greece
[Alexander Kebab]
The most known one (and the one that usually comes to peoples mind when said kebab) is [Adana Kebab] And the second most popular is [the Doner kebab
] According to my research, the most popular kebabs in Germany are those two, who had been around ever since medieval times
They just had been brought to Germany by Turkish diaspora, so it seems wrong to say those are german cuisine just because they are popular in Germany
But as I stated above, if a german chef (or a non-german chef in Germany who identifies as german) founded a new type of kebab there wouldn't be anything wrong with calling it german
But Adana and doner kebabs are definitely not like that
hope this helps fam
I am not sure for my country really
In olden times we loved opium so much that we named a province after it and still use the name
So, idk what will happen if we legalize cannabis
If tobacco is legal, then cannabis definitely should be
Greenland is same as size as, or bigger, than Australia so why Greenland is not a continent
and this was my argue with teacher until she found an encyclopaedia to show me their area in numbers
I kept mixing İsveç(Sweden) with İsviçre(Switzerland) until I learnt where they were on Atlas
You were living in the right timeline
*ROMA INVICTA*
İstanbul for history, religions skyscrapers and modernism
Athens for beauty and history
İzmir for history and foods
Madrid for esspecialy religions
Berlin for understanding what is eu like
London for its atmosphere and economy
Paris for seeing the beauty
Moscow for seeing the modenism and skyscrapers
Vienna for seeing what we couldnt take
[Madenci] It local coffee  brand which I haven’t drank any better one yet
Ayup, my current boyfriend is American
The cultural differences are too awkward sometimes
In turkish  the verb azmak means to come or to get horny while in Azeri and Eastern dialects of Turkey it means to get lost
I tried to spell it, it is pretty hard
For Turkey, the answer is no
But we have 2 types, youth and olds
Old complains time to time how they did things different than when they were in our age
But mostly they know that time has changed, the world has changed since then so they give us advice how to be a better person
At least this is how I encounter these types
By the way, It is rely on respect to each other
Only "O" it means he-she-it
o - means she/he
"O" means he/she/it, basically third person singular pronoun
O : means he ,she ,it   ( we say one word to man,woman and animals)
There's two that come to my mind right off the bat
O = He/She/It
E = Well would be the closest translation, but it's informal
"E yani" would translate to English imperfectly as "well more or less
" If you want to be even more informal a dragged out "e" sound would signify a "go on" that is likely said with impatience or suspicion
Also "e" is commonly used in spoken Turkish as "so
" and a specific way to say "so much".
In addition, Turkish has this letter ğ (soft g) which basically makes the previous vowel longer
So "ağ" is really "aa" and so on
And there we have a few more single vowel words
In Turkey that's a definite yes, along with talking about your possessions (the high-end ones like houses, shops, investments etc)
Asking about someone's earnings is even worse
Regardless, many people tend to do it but then their manners are questioned
Only talk about it if you want to talk about the job market, usually if you are in the same profession
It helps knowing how much you should negociate for when discussing salaries with your employer
Personally I haven't discussed my salary since I started making much more than the average wage and my friends who also make much more than the average dont either
I think black is more popular but green is popular as well
Probably like 60% black 40% green
Both are very popular but I've seen black more than green
Hmm
I can’t decide
Gemlik and Ayvalik are the two regions in Turkey that produce the most olives; and they are both known for their green olives
Well that could be true I'm not exactly an olive expert
It is just most of the people I know consume black olives that is why
But I personally prefer green olives
Not anymore
I used to walk when I was in Primary(2002-2008) literally anywhere
I was living in city over 2 million
My brother in other hand didn’t since we don’t trust the outside anymore
Either he was dropped by my father, walked with my mother or school bus
Depends on the province but in Istanbul not even adults just walk to places such as schools
The city is so large that you have to use some sort of a vehicle to get to places
For example, I am considered to live sort of close to my school but even with that it takes me 30 mins by bus to go to my school
My friends that live in the Asian side (our school is on the European side) have to wake up at like 5
00 am because it takes them 2 hours to go to school
So for small kids a lot of parents prefer private school buses (they are basically buses that specifically pick you from your house and leave you at school and vice versa
yes they are expensive but parents are willing to pay for that) and when they get older they usually start using public transport like subway, tram, buses and even ferries
This is what it looks like
To fix it I think you should add a colon to the end of the flags, like " :flag-de: living in :flag-dk: ".
[Yes, it's fixed] :) np
Turkey should not be considered in this subject
Turkish Republic is not secular in *at least* in this matter
I actually understand older Gokturk Turkish better than Ottoman Turkish
Ottoman has a lot of Persian and Arabic drived words so it is a bit hard
Folk poems and legends from 1600s are somewhat understandable, but a legal document from 1918 may be completely incomprehensible
Ottomas had (what I call it) a dual language system, one for is nobility and state business and one for regular people
Those two languages are both Turkish but the lexicology of the noble one is heavily affected from Persian and Arabic
Things were like that until the language reform in the Republic era in 1930s.
For more information:
**The articles** does not exist in Turkish Language
So, we use them incorrectly
Sometimes we forget to use, sometimes we overuse them
**a/an** is more understandable, but **the** and **the difference between the and a/an** are mystery lol
For the beginners, **a/an** is translated as *bir*(**one**)
(*bir elma* = **one apple, an apple**)
We can't translate **the**: "It doesn't have a meaning" is said to beginners
We use "açmak"(open) both for the act of opening a door or lid, and turning on an electronic device in Turkish
So it's rather common to see Turkish speakers use expressions like "open the lights" or "open the radio".
Another thing I see used is "pulling a photo" - as Turkish uses "çekmek"(pull) for taking photos
Instead of making rookie grammar mistakes, they will TALK TO YOU IN LOUDER TURKISH
We pronounce the word "archive" wrong
We took the word from French, so we try to pronounce it like French in English sentences
Funny thing is I realised that a month ago :)
Haha these encounters are always funny
Me and my couple friends were wandering around Porto streets and they were taking pictures of themselves quite long at famous rabbit pop art while I just wait at the corner
Relative 2 old couple approached and told each other “look at them, why they’re taking pictures etc
” LOUDLY IN SLANG TURKISH
I laughed very hard in front of their faces
You should have seen their red handed faces
It was hilarious
P.s: these couples were only Turkish tourists I encountered at our 3 days Porto visit
I imagine It was vice versa for them
It's compulsory for all Turkish citizens from birth
It's only accepted in Turkey, Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia and Northern Cyprus
Well, as I know it was always the same city
**1600s:** Kostantiniyye
**1700s:** Kostantiniyye

Not much variation
To get a different answer you must go before 1453 and the biggest city in that time was probably Edirne as it was the capital but I'm not sure
I can comfortably say Istanbul, Istanbul, Istanbul, Istanbul and Istanbul
Non-native speakers of English,when did you start learning English and how did you improve your reading and speaking
I first began to learn English at school at 11 years old but until 20,I can't speak,read books and can't watch series and movies
Nowadays I am watching The Big Bang Theory with English subtitles and reading Harry Potter in English for improve my English skills
My reading is still slow but I'm sure that it will be better
So,Non-native speakers of English How did you learn to speak English well
I think I was about 10 years old, that was the time I started getting English lessons at school
Those lessons helped me to learn the basics of English
I improved my English mostly by listening to English songs, watching movies/tv series with English subtitles, playing video games in English
I've met a guy who will come for Erasmus to Kayseri, Turkey
Let me define you the Kayseri
It's geographically in the middle of Turkey
Full of conservative people, economically so bad and it has one of the worst university in Turkey
I'm very surprised and try to convince him to not to come
Then Corona came
Idk what happened next
Two of my class friends went to Greece
I studied in a unknown small city in Italy
It was a great experience
European small cities can provide a good student life
It's easier to discover and ecperience a small city in a limited time
They are more affordable compare to larger cities (maybe Norway is an exceptation)
You don't waste your time in traffic, sometimes you can just walk
When activities are limited, erasmus students find their own way
It strenghten the bonds between them
Someone who likes rain, I guess
Yep, we have Türk Dil Kurumu (Turkish Language Society)
TDK aka Turkish Language Institution
It was founded by Atatürk in early 20th century to protect and improve the Turkish language
Atatürk also changed the alphabet letters from Arabian to Latin which is more fitting for Turkish language, but not as fitting as Cyril according to my Turkish language professor in college
Yes, we have Türk Dil Kurumu (Turkish Language Association)
It is the official regulatory body of the Turkish language
It was founded in 1932 by Atatürk
The institution acts as the official authority on the language (without any enforcement power), contributes to linguistic research on Turkish and other Turkic languages, and is charged with publishing the official dictionary of the language
It is not possible to make an objective list like this but here are three songs I personally love and would like to promote as good Turkish music
First one is from 1974, by the band **3 Hürel**, an all time star rock band composed of three brothers
Their hit song [Sevenler Ağlarmış] is unsurpassed in many ways
When you listen wait until 3'14''.
**Mercan Dede** is one of the big stars of Turkish electronic music
He incorporates sufi music into electronic music pretty well
[Sufi Dreams]
**Fazıl Say** is one of the most internationally famous Turkish musicians, a prodigy of classical music
He is one of the best pianists alive and also a great composer, utilising Turkish themes in his music
[Black Earth]
Bonus: **Peyk** is not such a well known modern rock band but this [Don Kafa Don] is my favorite and I also love the video
It’s not “fully” from my country, it’s a Dutch - Turkish band but the lyrics are full Turkish
Altın Gün - Süpürgesi Yoncadan
Pentagram is one of my favourite heavy metal bands
They are cool, also Anatolian rock is one of the best music genres, ever
You can check Erkin Koray, Cem Karaca and Barış Manço.
We have a march culture in Turkey since the foundation of Mehteran band in the Ottoman Empire many great songs were composed by Turks or Non Turks my favorites are from the 19th and 20th century of the Empire
After reforms of Mahmud II Empire started to westernize her music culture and a lot of songs and marches were composed I will do a list of those songs instead of giving one example:[Gondol Şarkısı ] [Mecidiye Marşı ] <—this march was composed by an Italian
[Mahmudiye Marşı] [İzmir Marşı] and finaly [Meclis-i Mebusan Marşı] there are more songs from early Ottoman era as well but I dont want to make this longer
[My own music] of course
:)))
"Aslan" means "lion" in Turkish
Is that coincidental
I’m really into Slavic folk music just because of them
>wait til 3'14''
What a terrible way to represent Turkey with a long gone empire
For the non-Turkish here, some of these marches are the anthems of the current oppressive islamist regime in Turkey, which like to show the ottoman culture as if it's the ancestral culture of Turkey, paving the way to a monarchic regime in the future
Yes, these people still exist
What
I have never heard even 1 time AKP using Mecidiye march or gondol song or Mahmudiye march what are you trying to say these are songs with no lyrics in them if you want to write an alternative to my songs then do another comment none of these songs are about Islam 2 of them are not even composed by a Muslim
None of these marches are used by AKP I would advise you to read my comment again
I never even said I want the Empire back I dont understand what you are doing
I said "some of these songs" are anthems to the current regime
I didn't say they are islamist
They are imperialistic, as in nostalgic of the times of a long gone empire
But of course you are entitled to like them and show them around
I was just shocked that the only entry from Turkey was not from Turkey :-)
Im not a far right supporter or anything but Turkey is the continuation of the Empire we paid the Ottoman debts and most of the people who formed the republic was from Ottoman traditions and education
None of these song are used by Akp Btw
Okay, we can have different opinions on that
I don't see Turkey as continuation of Ottoman Empire, rather a country that gained independence from it like all the others (you could say the Bulgarians or the Arabs also got Ottoman education and background
) But yes, the last Ottoman capital is in today's Turkey
And I admit I don't know the individual songs; I just say that the current regime loves Ottoman marches instead of Turkish marches and uses it for the said cause
Its okay to have different wiews of course but songs are good and most of them are composed by Turks thats why I said those songs so it fine no problem man
And those songs does not celebrate superiority of a Turkish person over others they are just songs but I of course respect your wiews
Granted, I'm not a Cypriot, but as a Turk this is relevant to my country's foreign policy a lot
Honestly, they should re-unite in my opinion, but that seems to be a pipe dream in the near future
You should ask this on r/Cyprus
This discussion is a mere past-time there
Not a Cypriot but I personally think Cyprus should reunite, but also be an independent state
Not Turkish, not Greek, not British
A separate entity on its own
I am not Cryptiot but I heard from a Northern Cyrptiot guy that the Turkish Cypriots are between meh and sure in reunification while Greek Cypriots are between naaah and meh
First of all, I'm not a Cypriot but I'm Turkish therefore I think I'm related to this topic
Reunification won't solve anything, as it was the thing that caused the problem in the first place
It's been going fine for almost 50 years, Recognizing Northern Cyprus as a State of it's own is  probably the best solution both sides can agree with
Of course a unification would be great but it won't happen due to 2 things first one being "politics" and the second one being the fact that we don't live on a planet where there's no such thing as discrimination
Also from what I've heard neither the greek nor the Turkish part likes non- Cypriots in their country, don't know how true it is though
Correct me I am wrong but when did Turkey not want unification
Far as I know, Turkey was Pro-Unification
All bow before the prophet
its not considered an occupation in Turkey
Yup, we generally do so
I think that the Northern part should make their own decisions and Turkey should stay in the background unless TRNC needs support
But, idk if the unification happens
Turkey and TRNC are too connected
Turkey is the biggest economic partner of TRNC
TRNC is also a place of different laws
They have gambling, a big tourism industry, etc
I don't know what would happen if they join the EU, Turkish people may not be able to visit them that often and that would diminish the economy a little
TRNC is also a somewhat safe heaven for young immigrants
It is a weird way to join the EU
There are people from all around the world to study there, live some time there, then go immigrate to mainland Europe
It is also a good place for Europeans to get cheap surgeries
Last and not least, I know people in Turkey who have summer houses in Cyprus
Idk, what would happen then
We don't even use passports to go to the island, we just use ID's. Many people would have to aquire passports and even visas
Thats all
I am open to questions
Turkey wants to troops to stay there until agreement signed
Greek side wants to gone before agreement is done
As summary, I guess Turkey wants them to stay until an agreement done is for leverage
If agreement not succeed again, World will see Turkey sending troops as aggression so with current international stage would make Turkey loose all EEZ right that it claimed
Turkey doesn’t recognise or signed EEZ because of Island Dispute with Greece in early years of republic
So there will be international court to solve this problem
Turkish and Greek Cypriots should do the unification agreement with approval of Greece and Turkey
Then I am sure if we all are grown enough to sign this agreement, we are grown enough to make unifying to happen
They do have a very distinctive accent yes, but then so do a lot of regions in Turkey proper, so ultimately it doesn’t make them any less Turkish
You know that TRNC founded in 1983 and is independent state in eye of Turkey, right
There will be referendum(like used to) in TRNC about unification which Turkey can’t do anything about it
Since Greece and Turkey protector of each state, I meant approval as just to sign, agree it whatever it comes out
Far as I know, Turkey has accepted what deal come from with protection and survivability of Turkish Part
I don’t know about why Turkey is main negotiator but I can guess as Greek side sees this as invasion and any other country other than Turkey doesn’t recognise this state
So this might be why
Turkey doesn’t have any political control over Cyprus as well
For us, they are independent state
This makes if deal is not what Turkish Cypriots like, this probably will be seen in referendum
Just approve what Cypriots agreed on and make it official
Turkish is protector state of Northern Cyprus which Turkish Army has presence of 35,000 and far as I know Greece is for Southern Cyprus
So approval makes it for both side to accepted reunion
Turkey doesn’t recognise or signed EEZ so what Turkey do looks acceptable for them
If you want to solve this issue, there should be court about Grey Island in Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece to start solving
Naval Supremacy can be gained with NATO and friendly relationship with Cyprus
It is critical for Turkey because nobody wants to enter Arab Country’s Shit Hole to be honest in Turkey
Erdogan’s dreams make him loose voters
They do have different parliament, army, president, government and laws
I do need visa to enter(which ID is enough) and residency permit to study or stay
It is and actual independent country for me and you whether your country recognise it or not
I think referendum shows what actual people of TRNC wants
Depends on how you look at TRNC
For me, it is not a puppet state
It is heavily depended on Turkey due to not being recognised but I don’t think a puppet state can start to drop Turkish Lira and start for making the country acceptable to EU for possible reunion
[President of TRNC,] say “It is considered as red line for North Cyprus to accept fully withdrawal of Turkish Army from Northern Cyprus ask by Greek and Greek Cypriot Side
Aren’t both of them same
Referendum is for future of both
It doesn’t exist, if you don’t recognise it
Nice motto
By the way, do you want me to take you TRNC
You can name whatever you want
At the end, you will have to recognise Northern Side to sign the reunion deal
Some see Turkey as heaven, others as shit show
Turkey is there to protect an independent state from Turkey for its interests
At this point, I think Erdogan doesn’t gives a shit about eye’s of the world, anymore
Whole world to Cyprus: “OMG, 2/5 of country has gone, I wonder what happened
Since I don’t recognise it, it means nothing happened
You are whole again
” It doesn’t matter if you recognise it or not
If it exists, it exists
Mmm maybe [because of this
] I like how you just forget the best part before Turkey sent the army where Greece did coup in Cyprus to make Cyprus join to Greece and before Greeks already removed [rights] which was given to Turks by protecting minorities
[Maybe help if you start reading from 1950’s to get why
Imagine voting against unification which 65% of Turkish Cypriots said “Yes” in 2004 and telling my why unification seems impossible
Yes, Turkey has right to protect its people, same for Greece
Maybe you understand me wrong
I don’t affirm anything other than protection of Turks and TRNC decision of reunion
+: (speaks with a perfect Istanbul accent)
-: "your accent is weird, where exactly are you from
"(with a perfect Istanbul accent)
+: "Wisconsin
"(with a perfect Istanbul accent)
I see this dialogue at least twice in different shows/movies
I don't know, but really wonder what's weird about Wisconsin accent
Unfortunately when I saw Fargo, my English was not good enough to distinguish accents
It was long time ago
But, I can check it now
Thank you for the suggestion:)
Each city has its own dialect, Each district in each city has its own dialect
But differences between district dialect is not seen much as between cities
In city centre, most of the people uses Istanbul Dialect so this is why it is hard to see now
We don't really have different dialects in Turkey
Some regions may use different words for stuff but that's all
But we have different accents
In urban areas like Istanbul
most people speak Istanbul Turkish (the official one)
But in rural areas like the black sea region(especially the northeastern part), southeastern Turkey etc
people there, especially the old ones, will have a different accent
Every region has its own dialect
For example a person from the Aegean region will hardly understand someone from eastern region
But everyone can understand Istanbul Turkish which is the main dialect of Turkish
Not a single nation/ethnicity name but whenever someone gets racist towards Turks over the things Ottoman sultans did I find it a bit amusing — they were barely “ethnic Turk
” considering how many had non-Turkish mothers then they made a kid with another non-Turkish mother and he became the next sultan
Same reason racism is kinda sorta hating yourself in this region and abouts
Any examples of any Turks claiming Homer was Turkic
English, Turkish or even Greek language sources will do
I agree
I’m referring to the racist comments based on ethnicity, over the Ottoman sultans, as I said
Doesn't say he is Turkish, it's just repeating the mythical origins of Homer
As far as we know now that Homer was likely a real person born in Western Coast of Anatolia but any other details are unknown
So saying that he was born in Smyrna is inaccurate, as that is not certain but other than that inaccuracy nowhere is it says he was Turkish
What
It's true that he was likely born in what is today Turkey in Western Coast of Anatolia
Ancient cities of Troy and Ephesus, as well as some of the first human settlements amongst others are also in what is now Turkey, so it's common for tourism related webpages or tours to advertise them as they are attraction
Doesn't mean they are Turkish
You are grasping at some straws here
So you saw some person, who may or may not be serious, say that homer is Turkic
So you went ahead to say that "Turks (in general) claim Homer is Turkish". You might have seen that on youtube or instagram somewhere, that is not falsifiable so it is beyond commentary but no, Turks (in general) don't claim Homer is Turkic
So you can put that to rest now
Amazing how people can just make stuff up saying "dude trust me" as proof
I am sure you have, I have too
For example just yesterday I saw a Greek claim that Trojans were Hellenes but to say that all Greeks believe pre-hellenic Anatolian civilisations to be Hellenes would be inaccurate
It's not taught in your history as such, or shown in your media as such I assume
Similarly, pre-Turkish Anatolian civilisations, including Ionians are taught in Turkish history books as completely distinct entities that are not Turkic
In fact the opposite, Turkish history books emphasise the Turkic ancestry of Turks too much while ignoring Anatolian ancestry of people of Turkey
So you can see how making generalisations like this based on random internet commentaries you read in English might not be accurate, yes
Are you dim
Where did I say Ionians are Turkish
Considering your comprehension it's no wonder you think that Turks believe Homer to be Turkic
I have implied or said no such thing
As I said, now I understand why you think that Turks believe Homer is Turkic
Especially considering that you also believe someone stating Homer was likely born in what is now Western Turkey is claiming that he is Turkish
Revolution history and Atatürkism/Kemalism
The name is pretty self explanatory imo :)
We have mandatory Philosophy lessons in High School
We mainly learn about Ancient Greek Philosophers and their ideas
I've heard other Europeans having Ethics or Religious classes but I've never heard anyone mention Philosophy classes
A class called human rights, citizenship and democracy
lol
We have it
They made me paint a wooden tray in late 90s for some reason
Not in Turkey, lol
The problem caused from the translation
It is actually the history of Atatürk's revolutions
Like the women right to vote or we establishing the rupublic
etc
Edit: I just checked the textbook for the course from internet
It basically covers life of Atatürk and his revolutions
History class covers everything from First Civilizations all the way to the World Wars, but not very detailed
Revolution History covers only the Atatürk Era (1881-1938), in a detailed way
At least a few on the Syrian and Iraqi borders
During holiday times, it is usually on the news, people throwing gifts and stuff to each other over the border to celebrate
Technically they are neighbours living in different countries
Yes, according to some people in Europe 1453 was not a glorious year
Do i even have to give an example
Yes, yes I do
Pijamas
Do Greeks get offended if I sing [“İzmir’in Dağlarında Çiçekler Açar”] Song(March) is not against directly to Greeks but it mentions as all enemies by that time
I, once, read on the news about some songs in Greece to provoke Turkey
I am not sure if it is correct or not
No, but I do get offended
Because that song is just a cover (which is like what, 3-4 years old) of the original song "Kafkasya daglarinda
"  (which is ~100 years old), which has nothing to do with Izmir or Greeks
Since when does Izmir have mountains to sing about
It is true that lyrics have changed after Independence War but it doesn't mean that I am going to ignore one side because of it
Izmir March has same value as Kafkasya March which both of them are very old marches
I explained that in Izmir March there is nothing against to Greeks as well as in Kafkasya March it is about a non-specific enemy
Some(a few) Greeks might be offended due to Izmir March's Lyrics and Izmir's Independence from occupying forces
[Bazı kaynaklarda İzzeddin Hümayi Elçioğlu tarafından I. Dünya Savaşı'nın Kafkasya Cephesi için "Kafkasya Marşı" olarak 1914 yılında bestelendiği bilgisi geçer
Bu kaynaklara göre Türk Kurtuluş Savaşı sonrası sözleri değiştirildi ve "Kafkasya dağlarında" yerine "İzmir'in dağlarında" veya "İnönü Dağları'nda" diye başlayan deyişleri üretildi
Just bought and finished the tutorial of ck3 after hours of Stellaris, lol
I was actually going to play as Byzantium and restore the roman empire but felt like this might have been a bit overwhelming on my first ever play of a genre I never played before (Stellaris is 4x too but you will quickly realise their only similarity is being 4x.)
I am currently playing as Khazaria for my first play, not because they are Turkic but a Jewish state in the middle of Muslims and Christians sounded fun to me
EUIV
England, Netherlands, German minors, Italian Minors
England for colonizing
Netherlands for tall build along with colonization to fight above your weight
German and Italy because small nation into OP shit is fun
Vicky 2
Ottomans, USA, South American nations, Sardinia Piedmont/Italy
Ottomans are fun in Vicky 2 because there is a lot to do and you are challenged in a lot of ways but have enough resources to come out stronger if you play well
USA because larping to share freedom to the world is fun
Also if you meme hard enough you have an isolated area where you can have constant revolutions and can get weird governments while still being a great power
South America because it is a land of equally weak countries and the satisfaction of coming out on top of the continent and becoming a great power
Italy
Same reason as in EUIV but not as OP as Germany
Hoi4: USA, UK, Japan, Italy, USSR, China, Yugoslavia
I like the navy and diversity mechanics of USA, UK, Italy and Japan
Horde armies with USSR and China
Yugoslavia games can just go in any direction
Ottoman Empire or Turkey or Sweden
Because when you play as sweden
I dont know
But ı know that playing the game as Turkey is my mission
Antalya (in Turkey), I'm planning on cycling there
Anywhere in Switzerland
Got weird looks as a solo traveler
Probably yeniköy coast (Köybaşı Street)
I pay attention to license plates so, lots
I've seen Australian, Korean, South African, several American, Pakistani license plates in Turkey and Kazakh, Chinese plates in Germany
I saw one from a South American country in the Netherlands but I can't remember which
Also it's not quite so foreign but slightly relevant, I saw a San Marino license plate in Bulgaria (in Varna iirc)
Years ago, in high school, my friends and I were walking downtown near the Parliament building, and saw a parked minivan with a New York plate
It was a black van with dark tinted windows and we joked that it was a CIA listening van
Californian license plate & Egyptian license plate
&#x200B;
Oh saw some from Tajikistan too when I was in Georgia
Lifted Ford F150 with Trump Stickers and Texas Licenses Plates
I don't know, but I guess that's the likeliest possibility
If it were actually CIA, they probably would have been smart enough to get a local licence plate
Came with English so same
Meaning would be meat in Turkish tought :)
At pronounced as "et" means meat
"Kuyruklu a" which means "a with a tail". Pretty straightforward lol
In Turkish :
**pronounced as** : "et" *(litereally meat)*
**called as :** "kuyruklu a" (*a with a tail*)
1) Any other Turkic State
2) Any state with Turkish Player
3) Europe
4) South Korea or Japan
Azerbaijan, whether it's football or things like Eurovision
We and Azerbaijanis have a saying "one nation, two states" - Azerbaijan is, just like Turkey, a predominantly Muslim Turkic nation with very similar language and culture, we're both located in West Asia and Europe, far away from our ancestral homeland in Central Asia, so we share a special bond, so Turks will always cheer Azerbaijan during various competitions and vice versa
I always cheer for England
Well, that's where Turks originate from
Obviously current Turks have more Anatolian, Balkan, Caucasian and Middle Eastern DNA than Turkic one but some Central Asian ancestry remains to this day along with our language and culture
Because identity > genetics
There are even people who are literally ~100% Laz, Bosnian, Kurdish etc in Turkey who identify as Turks due to being born and raised in Turkey, speaking Turkish, having Turkish names and being Turkish citizens
For example you're a Cypriot, as you may know both Greek and Turkish Cypriots are mostly not actually either Greek ot Turkic in terms of genetics, they bear more similarity to Near Eastern people than they do Southern Europeans or Central Asians
And yet you probably feel more connection to Greeks due to speaking Greek, having a Greek name/surname and practicing Greek culture than to Near Eastern people with whom you share more genetic similarity compared to Greece
Turkish and Greek Cypriots don't differ all that much in terms of genetics, both are essentially the same people assimilated into different cultures/identities, and identity was more important than genetic similarity when it came to war, right
So Turks identify with Turkic culture and people despite not being 100% Turkic anymore, cause an average Turk knows that he'll receive a warm welcome  from his fellow Turkic people despite not being mostly Turkic genetics-wise whether he goes to Bashkortostan and Tatarstan in Russia or Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in Central Asia, while Balkan people won't count him as one of them no matter how much genetic similarity to them he bears
> identities being created by minority extremist groups in Cypriot Turks case the grey wolfs etc
While Turks aren't innocent either don't you think that the issue is also caused by, you know, literal Greek nationalists overthrowing Cypriot government and massacring Turkish Cypriots
Or that far-right nationalist extremism isn't exclusive to the Turkish side in Cyprus but there are Greek nationalists and even literal neo-Nazis among Greek Cypriots too
> Anyway what I am saying is whrn the identification is natural its okay, but not when its enforced by others other countries trying to change our identities for their own gains
Yeah but our conversation wasn't even about that initially, it started with me describing Central Asia as the "ancestral homeland" of the Turks and you objecting
It utterly shocked me how slow the bureaucracy was in France
I mean I've heard how slow it is but I didn't EXPECT this much
Their printing machine was broken so they couldn't print out my residence permit and I couldn't work for a while
Even in Turkey most of the stuff are quick and online so I was baffled a bit
Also portions of food were much more smaller
I love driving
Driving to work while listening to the radio is the highlight of my day
My visit to Germany was heaven
Everyone was driving so smooth, so responsibly, so well mannered
It was as if, the traffic was a river and all of us were flowing with it, in harmony
Didn't know you could drive for hours and not get angry
In France it's the same too
You can travel in the EU for 90 days but you cannot travel outside of EU if you don't register your residence permit
It's kinda complicated in France
When you settle in France you immediately have to go to OFII to register, they call you back 1-2 months later for your residence permit
I was in a small town and the machine was broken apparently so I had to wait for
2,5 months to get my residence permit and I had already registered myself when I came as soon as possible
In Turkey I can print out my diploma from an app it's amazing lol and the banking system is more convenient
Andorra: I don't know anything other than the French President is one of its heads of state
San Marino: Oldest republic still existing so
neat, I guess
Monaco: Gambling
Vatican City: HQ of the largest pedophile organization in the world
Liechtenstein: Why the fuck did you give women the vote so late
dear usa pls don't start another war in our neighbours AGAIN
we already have 7 million refugees(world record)
tnx bye
Good call
US and Iran have been fighting small skirmishes for years anyway and it took too many unnecessary lives
Here you kill 5 people, one of them being a top military leader
Iran will just continue whatever they have been doing for years but will have their decision making take a hit for up to a year
Ain't no war is going to come out of this
Fuck if I know
Yea we're just gonna hop onto planes and invade Austria
We have a long way to go to reach you guys
Why do people act like Turkey conducting a millitary operation in Syria is such crazy news when more or less everyone did it
US, Russia, UK, France, Canada, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates etc, it's basically a free-for-all battle royale territory at this point
There is no way that idiot invades you
As a Turk I can guarantee you even Erdogan can’t be that stupid
> recent bullshit they've been doing
Such as attacking a militia that's literally designated as a terrorist organization in dozens of states, including yours
Bro if I had the means to go to Viena I would have years ago
It is a old forgotten dream
Now we are just dreaming of living above poverty line
I understand, I was talking about the "recent news from Syria" remark - Turkey conducting millitary operations there is hardly an argument when literally everyone and their grandma bombed Syria at this point
Saying that Turkey attacks "Kurdish people" when fighting PKK/YPG is like saying that US attacks Afghans when fighting against Taliban or Muslims when fighting against ISIS
One small group of millitants =/= entire ethnic group
PKK has a long history of carrying out terrorist attacks in Turkey and is designated as a terrorist organization by all countries of NATO & EU as well as some others, Turks are not okay with having their Syrian branch on Turkish borders
This isn't about Erdogan, I hate him yet still support the operation - opposition parties support it as well, it's a matter of national security for us, not politics
>  I still think Erdogan is a bad leader besides that though, seeing how "well"  Turkey's economy is doing
Considering that one Bulgarian lev is like a billion liri ot doesn't sound good
Oh I agree on that, I'm just tired of Western media equating ~40 million Kurds to one millitant Kurdish group that has like 30,000 fighters and therefore presenting attack against said group as attack against "the Kurds". There are literally thousands of Kurds in Turkish millitary participating in the fight against them and even a Kurdish rebel group called Hamza Division that fights *alongside* Turkey against PKK & YPG
P.S. I believe the exchange rate is roughly 1 leva = 3 Turkish liras now, back when I used to study in Bulgaria leva and lira were around the same so we sure have seen better times
r/expextedsabaton
That would be too extreme for us
Yeah, We have one of those and generally they are called "Mom's Homemade Food" or "Mom's Cook"
For example [link ]
They serve essentials of Turkish Cuisine like lentil soup, stuffing, borek, Turkish Dumplings and various of beef and chicken dish
In Turkish:
*kopya* (n.) copy
*kopya çekmek* (v.) to make a copy
Depends on the school
Most private schools have lockers but there usually aren't lockers in government schools
You bring your stuff with your bag
It’s not a norm
Students bring their materials with a backpack everyday
Granted, my high school had lockers in classes
So you can definitely find schools that uses them but it’s out of the ordinary
Also there are closets in every class in elementary school
It’s for the whole class to use but students don’t leave their personal stuff in it
Milyon, Milyar, Trilyon, Katrilyon for million, billion, trillion and quadrillions
106 Milyon
109 Milyar
1012 Trilyon
1015 Katrilyon
Well, there's a milyar over there
So we're not skipping it lmao
That make sense
Istanbul
Under my high school there is an old underground church
It is connects to other underground tunnels leading to Golden Horn
Other than that I guess it's pretty obvious that Istanbul got some 'underground'.
There are many, especially in İstanbul
Most of them are left from Roman/Byzantium era
The most popular one is Basilica Cistern which you can visit
There are also many tunnels, catacombs you can’t access or unaware of really
I dont know but surely there is
Because its Istanbul bro
Honestly aside from all the bad things happening last couple years, we at least have kebab and Döner
Lately it’s our government, sadly
Turns our neighbours against us
Number one in tea consumption
>Hungary has the oldest underground railway in continental Europe
If you don't count [Tünel] in Istanbul
Not exactly “Thank you” but we say “Kolay Gelsin(The job you do may it easy to you-you basically wish their job to be easy-), İyi Günler(Have a good day), Hayırlı İşler(Have auspiciousness businesses)
If you ask something to driver, you start with Thank you then say something like these
But I wouldn’t say it is a custom directly to bus drivers but these are the customs that you can use anywhere
Buses are usually so crowded that you can't even see the driver when getting off
Which country/countries have the most aesthetic borders ?
I personally like how Italy, Greece and Japan looks
I quite like Turkeys to be honest
But might just be bias
Georgia looks like Weeknd’s hair in his early years
Oh, this asked recently ?  I didn't know that
Also yes I agree Cyprus has unique borders
or maybe your flag promote your borders well :)
Well, that was not the question but this is really cool
Yes, I think so I could include the UK as well
I see a puzzle piece when I look at Spain
Such an imagination
Congrats
Some people have really good imagination here
You are one of them for sure :)
Sweden would make too big balls
Finland looks better as balls
Sorry to all Swedish and Finnish people in this sub for that sentence :)
As a turk, this shit pisses me off
Obviously, I can’t say anything about it in public because of the police, but it sucks
Kurds deserve their own state
Erdogan is a fucking horrible ass of a human being
Comments are so one-sided
But I don't blame you, the media
Because you don't have to worry about Syria, Kurds, Turks, immigrants
You just sit on your comfortable couch and watch or read the news
And say "Ooo, Turk bad
Kurd good
". I still don't blame you, how the hell will you know what is happening in Turkey
Who died because of the terrorist attacks of this fuckers
I mean PKK
Who died, let me tell: MY FRIEND
Please don't cross the line when you speak about topics that you are not informed well
Kurdistan
I need much more information about that subject
Did they declare a state in North Syria
&#x200B;
Syrian Kurds(PYD) has publicly shown their support toward to PKK(which is recognised as an terrorist group in USA and EU)
[American Defense Secretary Ashton Carter confirmed "substantial ties" between the PYD/YPG and the PKK
Testifying to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Congress, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, the top U.S. intelligence official, explicitly defined the YPG as the "PKK's militia force in Syria”.] Due to this situation Turkey considers both armed people under these names as Terrorist Organisation
For you this might seem as bravery but for us it seems as on going terror organisation for 40 years which resulted 40,000 people death in Turkey since 1984
While this is going on creating around 1150km long fully controled area by terrorist at Turkey's Border, you can't make Turkey(or any country) to shut about it
I am not even talking about rising Syrian problem in Turkey
Society as well as economy can't hold on anymore
&#x200B;
My opinion about this war is ''This should not happened in the first place when Turkey summited Safe Zone project in 2012 which Syrian Immigration problem just about to start
We could have made this easy for everyone
I'm really sad about this whole thing
I hope he, together with his cronies, faces trial one day, for all of his crimes against this country and humanity
Unfortunately, this is very unlikely
You know who I'm talking about, I can't utter his name
As well as USA should have kicked out of NATO when they entered the Afganistan and Iraq and arming a terror organisation which has  problem with another NATO member
EU is long shot dream of Turkish Citizens
With current government it is impossible
But at the end it is not
Oppressing Kurds, can you extent that topic so I can answer it better
&#x200B;
I am neutral on subject of Kurds deserving their own state
If we let that happen like okay now you take a state
Next thing we know, other minorities will ask for it which might end up as same as Syrian situation all around the globe
But if Iraq government says they can leave the country with peace
I am full on board
Taking a state from Turkey is against Turkey's constitution which [ARTICLE 3- The State of Turkey, with its territory and nation, is an indivisible entity
] Claiming might result a civil war
It started in 1978
These Kurds killed 40,000 people since 1984
Turkey has 14 million Kurds who we live together happily
It is going on since then
Turkey opposed “Safe Zone” in 2012 which nobody listened
Now our society and economy can’t handle 4 million Syrians
Why now
America armed Terrorist Organisation on Turkey’s border which extent 1150km and leaving the area without a control
This is a big security concern to Turkey’s Border
Basically problem is this
Invasion is Bad, this problem should have solved in 2012 but we are (whole world) is stupid enough to push these decisions until people started to die
We are really bad at hiding it
There are approximately 14 million Kurdish People in Turkey and we start in Syria
Economical Sanctions will increase problem much more to be sure
This problem can be solved politically if world stops and listens for a minute what is problem with both sides
I'm not a big fan of what erdo is doing in syria but thats kinda true
This is a very shitty situation but you should know why Turkey is doing this
There are red flags for USA to be kicked out but I've never seen anyone to talk about it
USA shouldn't help them in the first place without any control
&#x200B;
Syrian Kurds(PYD) has publicly shown their support toward to PKK(which is recognised as an terrorist group in USA and EU)

I hope I can help you understand Turkey's point
What would you feel if Turks in Germany wanted to leave Germany
Everyone expect his voters think that way
With Kurds, there is non
With Kurdish Terrorist, we have on going problem for 40 years
I don’t have much geographical knowledge of Germany but like Frankfurt Area(imagine German Turks are being majority in that city) wants to become independent from Germany as to like joining to Turkey
Would you agree allowing that
Would be okay if some German Turks create terror organisation to separate area from Germany since 1978
Would be okay that terror organisation kills 40,000 Germans since 1984
Would you be okay if there is another terror organisation in other city which is bordering to Germany and due to instability around that border now they have 1150km long of area on your border
Would you be okay if that Terror Organisation creates that much land on your border
This is basically this operation is all about
Kurds are not the problem, Those terror organisations are the problem
Turkey doesn’t claim any land from Syria
Just doesn’t want to let those terror organisations to grow on our border
Not Every Kurd, by the way
In 1970’s, there were different groups of people who ranged wanting cultural and linguistic expression to independent Kurdish State within borders of Turkey which is PKK
PKK declared self independent
This is how the problems started
Since 1984, PKK targeted 40,000 people in Turkey, without differencing if they are military personal or civilian
Kurds in Syria is known by supporting PKK
USA knows them as Militia Arm of PKK in Syria
USA armed them now leaving them on Turkey’s border without any control
With current situation, these terror organisations are controlling 1150km area on Turkeys border
This is a big security concern for Turkey
This whole operation could have been solved in 2012 when Turkey suggested a Safe Zone right before mass immigration started
Yes, but I can't tell native speakers apart from other native speakers
Like, if you showed me 10 clips of native speakers talking, and told me 3 of them were from London and the rest were from New York, I would correctly guess one, maybe two Londoners at most
I can distinguish by their accent
However, when its comes to for Swedish person
I think I would have hard times to guess
As a Turk, who is been to Germany and tried the famous Döner shops (so i’ve been told),  I beg the differ
But it might just be preference
Likely so
I appreciate that you even remember the names
Glad you enjoyed those
In Adana, they shoot bullets at sun bcz it was so hot
Whole country is still chuckling about this
Adana is the Turkish equivalent of Florida
Adana, Its one of the 81 cities
Its basically Florida in turkey
Adana
when temperature reaches 40°C, they will fire guns to the sun
they're taking revenge
Yeah they are Turkish
even the name of place sound pretty much Turkish lol
Crete however has Turkish Christians and Muslim greeks
Yeah someone threw a handgreanade to their mother-in-law another guy drove his car to a river to cool the car,another person shot at the sun because it was too hot
One guy used his shotgun to "kill the sun"
man, you got the point
most accurate is probably кырджалы. (I don't know you guys have that ы letter, it's more suitable to specify the I,ı sound in Turkish
Greeks with turkish roots probably
Since after population exchange muslims came to Turkey
It gets hot in south Anatolia, and its very humid as well so it gets very hot
[You asked for it
Well I dislike Turkish music as a whole so I'm not sure which one I would call the worst
Best Greek singer
Thank you for this gold tho
People who living with their families are usually kind of people that have an arranged marriage and live as that with no problem
Also, bringing someone other than your long time partner that your parents know is a bit off
Turkish anthem called İstiklal Marşı means The march of Freedom is very epic one
Every monday and friday we sing it at school
It isn’t long,only 1 minute
I think it's pretty good
"Istiklal Marşı" is Turkey's official anthem, and i am very happy with it
Yeah it is patriotic, it written while Turkish Inpendenece War happening, and its also made for soldiers get improved
It is pretty long, i am translating the first words: "Dont fear, the moon and the star at dawn will not stop burning"
It sounds pretty good
Kahraman ırkımın literally translated into my hero race
Rather than that the poet stands on the idea of nation

Hazelnuts
We produce the most hazelnuts By %80
Nutella gets its hazelnuts from Turkey
So be careful ur Nutella may say things like '' It's Istanbul Not Constantinople'' or '' It's been 567 years  forget it''
They're not so common nowadays
Language itself can be real childish easily
You can make the language sound like 4-5 years old
Other than I can’t think of like that one
Edit: I guess it would be “-mtırak” translates to specify a colour similar to what colour has added on
For example “Sarımtırak” means when you at that colour it bring the though of being yellow but not 100% yellow
Mavimtırak(For Blue), Yeşilimtırak(Green), Kırmızımtırak(Red), etc
There are words for and “and so on” and “etc” like “benzeri(depends on the sentence)” and “falan”. “Yemek memek” is to represent something you can eat but doesn’t specify like a full meal or snack or sandwich etc
and this is grammatically exist not just in some words
“Su mu içsene” Drink something liquid(any type to find solution to problem)
“Araba maraba alsaydınız keşke” I wish you could have bought vehicle something like car(etc
“Uçakta kitap mitap okusaydın” You could have read something like book during the flight
Edit: These are called “İkilemeler or in English Reiteratives”.
You can make to “Yedi kedi yedi” (Seven cats have eaten-this or that-)
It just means "seven cats".
Seven Cats tho
make
Food
Most people don't know it's where heroin comes from
The fields are guarded by military police tho
I think most people do know
I even knew it as a kid and thought I’d get high by eating opium poppy bread
I even got fake “highs” with bread
It's a top export here and USA has been on our asses about it ever since the late 60s.
So they ended up taking extreme precautions like this one to keep things legal
In Turkish there is “kuş dili” which can be translated into English as bird language
After every syllable a -gi -ge -ga -gu -gü is added like “sana söylüyorum”—> “saganaga sögülügüyogorugum” (I am telling you)
yeah, it’s called “kuş dili” which basically means bird language
you add a g after every vowel and put the same vowel after it, for examle take the word “merhaba” which means hello; you say it like “megerhagabaga”
In Ottoman Empire, the most competent heir used to sit on the throne
Later they changed that rule to the eldest son
I’d stop that change
So many incompetent sultans ruled because of it
We even had a sultan with mental deficiency that one time
Such a stupid change
There are thousands of ways we could have avoided The Great War
But I don't think I would want to change it because yes; we might have kept the control over Middle-East, but we wouldn't have the modern Turkish republic created by Ataturk
We'd be just Iran, but on steroids
I'd have Enver Pasha die in the Battle of Çatalca in 1913(so the Ottomans don't headbutt Russia, get smacked, and then blame Armenians and you know the rest)
It would be pretty nice if the Entente didn't refuse to give us the territories we asked for (Aleppo, Mosul, Arbil, Kirkuk, and the Aegean Islands) after the War of Independence
Mustafa I in 17th century
My heart wishes I was able to answer "horse archers" but sadly that isn't what it is

Rakı for sure(no, rakija is another thing)
I've tasted it never, but people tell me it tastes like ouzo
Rakı, i ve not tried but at first shot nobody likes it lol
It tastes sweet and like anise
it's just vodka distilled with star anise
ppl get used to it i guess, lol
I think it's pretty easy, compared to German or French
Yes but actually no
Learning new language is hard over all but for Turkish it is little bit harder than comparing to Germanic and Latin languages
You start with forgetting most of your Turkish knowledge because it basically opposite of most of the time
Sentence Structure, non-agglutinative, Words are not written as you pronounce them, English words are in Turkish is not much(Only 14% Turkish contains foreign based word which highest 2 languages are French and Arabic by 6%), etc
For a person who’s mother tongue as Turkish needs to start like an English baby to learn how speak English
After learning English, other languages like Germanic and Latin become too easy to learn but still hard enough that you have to try harder to maintain your knowledge
Threads about how Europeans are fools for not defending their nation the way Americans told them to
damn I wish I had foreskin
This feels too alien for me
>I know Turkey is a Islamic country
Muslim majority*
>Turkey are there men who for whatever reason dont get circumcised
>how are those men viewed/treated by other Turks & by Turkish society/culture
Seen as people with weird dicks, treated the same as a regular person
>like do you know any Turkish men who are uncut
Not a single one
>do many Turkish men wish they were not circumcised
I have no idea
>And lastly how is foreskin generally viewed in Turkey and what do people think of uncut dicks
They don't know what uncircumcised dicks look like, neither did I for a very long while
People who do know what they look like tend to think they look weird

Saraybosna was built at the time of Ottoman Rule (I mean yeah, Ottomans weren't the first there but they built lots of things and constructed the basics of city), and first name was Bosnasaray iirc, saray means palace in Turkish
Ö brotherhood
Well, Ğ>ß>Ö>Others is more accurate
We have yandex, it's russian but very well localized and quite good
I prefer Google maps tho
In Turkey we have ATLAS
There is no traffic option
Only satellite and terrain, with meteorology
Other than Atlas, we have a map which you can see main roads very detailed
Another one is showing Forestry
There are also municipalities own maps which based on OpenStreetMap but with real traffic data
1₺ = Bottle of Water
10₺ = Chicken Döner
100₺ = A shirt from a mid-tier brand
1 TL = maybe a bottle of water or little chocolate
10 TL = 1 KG orange (maybe) or a packet of Lay's chips
100 TL = low/medium quality earphones
- Taxi drivers endlessly driving around to increase the price of the ride
Another common scam by taxi drivers is relying on your lack of attention and handing you the change from 20 liras even though you gave them 200, or change for 10 liras instead of a 100, for example, if you'll notice they'll keep insisting you gave them less than you actually did
Or sometimes they'll take your money, quickly switch it out with fake equivalent, then hand it back to you claiming that it's counterfeit and they can't accept it while obviously keeping the real thing, or give you a slightly ripped fake banknote and say that you gave them damaged money and they can't take it while they hide the real liras you paid them
- A shoe shiner "accidentally" dropping his brush while walking in front of you and pretending not to notice, then offering you a free shoe cleaning session if you return it to him as a "thank you" gesture
Once he's done the cleaning turns out to be not so free all of a sudden
Some cleaners straight up start cleaning your shoes without permission, then demand money, in other cases several shoe shiner kids will surround you, as one distracts you by cleaning your shoes the others will steal stuff from your pockets of bags
- Friendly dudes or attractive girls chatting you up and bringing you to "their favorite" bar/pub/club that they obviously work at in reality, if it's a girl she might start flirting and ask you to buy her a drink, if it's a guy you just might start drinking together, then it will either turn out that the drinks cost 10x the normal amount or that the place has an "entrance fee" which may cost hundreds of dollars
A bouncer will come to you and force you to pay, if you don't have money they'll take your phone or documents as a deposit that they'll hold on to until you find money and return, or escort you to the closest ATM while threatening you with physical violence in case you fail to pay up
- "Disabled" or "homeless" beggars that actually work for organized crime syndicates - they're actually dropped off in public places every morning and driven back every evening by their "handlers". Usually they're neither homeless nor disabled in reality, or they'll have a kid or someone disabled by their side so that they can abuse and exploit them to guilt you into giving them money
Said disabilities are often *intentionally inflicted on these people by their handlers*, so if you give them money you're only funding their suffering
Taxi drivers are well known with their tourist scams

Very usual
One of my favourite mezes is octopus salad
As a Turkish PhD student in the States, I was very surprised to learn that they don't eat octopus here
I ate octopus only once in Chicago, which was the worst octopus meal I had in my entire life
It was even worse than the almost raw octopus I ate in Japan
&#x200B;
TLDR: We eat octopus in Turkey
&#x200B;
Edit: If any Japanese is reading this, I don't mean to offend you
Raw octopus is just not my thing
Yooo komsu
Mezes are the best kind of food lol
Yeah me too but even though we are dysfunctional siblings we are still siblings
Adana, some guy tried to shoot sun there and another guy drove his car to a river  to cool the car
Adana, which is a province in southeastern Anatolia and hot as fuck
Since some guy there got tired from heat and fired at sun a few years ago, lots and lots of memes about it are being made
Ahahaha was just about to say the same thing
I definitely wouldn't. Turkey is only controversially a European country, under the rule of a corrupt politician like Erdogan but the state structure itself, and daily life in general are quite similar to their EU counterparts
It is a welfare state, first and foremost
The US on the other hand is like a battlefield where the rich win and the poor lose, while the middle-class slowly fades away
Cultural aspects are not attractive as well, they promote the need to consume, Christian values and capitalist propaganda
Unless you are rich enough to maintain your life well, the US is not "The Country of Freedom" but rather "The Country of Utter Doom".
No, I wouldn't want to worry about my life in case I happen to have a serious illness in the future
I also wouldn't want to give away my labour rights (e.g. holidays)
Lastly, although I have completed my education, I like learning as a pastime activity so chances are I'll go for a few associate degrees in the near future in the fields that I enjoy
I can do this here, not there, unless I'm willing to pay for it
My mom won't shut up about my birth, nor will my grandma shut up about the birth of my dad and two uncles
As far as I know, completely normal to talk to family about such experiences
Lahmacun, çiğköfte and içli köfte with a side of şalgam (spicy fermented black carrot juice) always makes me happy
Also tavuk pilav (chicken and buttered rice) with pickles is really good too

Montenegro: Karadağ (Black Mountain)
Hungary: Macaristan (Land of the Magyar)
Belarus: Beyaz Rusya (White Russia)
United Kingdom: Birleşik Krallık (United Kingdom)
Germany: Almanya
Wales: Galler
Albania: Arnavutluk
Egypt: Mısır
Morocco: Fas
Republic of Cyprus: Güney Kıbrıs Rum Yönetimi (Greek Administration of Southern Cyprus)
Egypt is Mısır in Turkish, mısır means corn
We call Netherlands "Hollanda" and Hungary "Macaristan
I believe it's a nation thing
All of those new world countries has no nation
May be other than some south america ones
Even though the exact translation of the UK is "Birleşik Krallık" in Turkish, it is very rarely used that way
We just call it "İngiltere", which means "England
Indeed it is interesting
We call Cpyriot and Anatolian Greeks "Rum"(Roman) but mainland Greeks from Greece are called Yunan/Ionian
>Karadağ - Literal translation from English (or Italian)
Nope
"Црна Гора" means black mountain in Montenegrin language
English and Italian versions of it are also direct translations from Montenegrin
>is Kıbrıs island of Cyprus
Yes, Kıbrıs = Cyprus
>How do you call northeren part
Kuzey Kıbrıs Türk Cumhuriyeti = Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
If the Greek administration that controls the southern part officially call themselves Greek Republic of Southern Cyprus that represents only southern part, Turkey would gladly call them a Republic
Turkey doesn't care what you recognize though
Turkey is just ok with its small beautiful colony in the middle of E. Mediterranean
There are several Old Turkic epics like Ergenekon, Oğuz Kağan, and Alp Er Tunga
There are also Medieval Anatolian epics like Dede Korkut and Köroğlu
In terms of modern literature, there is  the "Kuva-yı Milliye" epic written by Nazım Hikmet, and the "Gallipoli Epic"
If I had to choose I'd go for either Dede Korkut or Kuva-yı Milliye
Not in urban areas
There are mostly dogs, cats and birds on the streets and occasionally squirrels in parks
In rural areas, the list expands to deer, fox, bear, hedgehog, wild boar, hare, snake, mouse, grey wolf, birds of prey etc
It changes depending on where you live because their habitats are different
Turkey is very diverse in that regard
What do you call the Holy Roman Empire in your language
Wanted to know if it includes "germanic or german" word in it
In Turkish, it is called "Kutsal Roma Cermen İmparatorluğu" (Holy Roman Germanic Empire)
It was officially titled as "İmparator" meaning "The Emperor" here in Turkey
It seems like our translators didn't want to spend much time on it lol
But I've never seen anyone call it that
I guess the title didn't really stick
Yes, there is
In fact, the movement had begun about more than a century ago but it only made its way to the official state agenda in 1932
The Turkish Language Association (TDK) was founded shortly after the proclamation of the republic as the regulatory body of Turkish, one of its primary goals being the purification of the language
Around that time, reformation in the Turkish language was nothing new, as there had been strong advocates for a purified Turkish since the late imperial era
Although with the foundation of the TDK, it was formalized
How did it end up
Pretty successfully to be honest
The actions taken to purify the language by replacing the loanwords are now known as the Turkish Language Revolution
Imagine that there was a language predominantly comprised of Persian, French and Arabic loanwords being solely used for the matters of state (which is Ottoman Turkish), and a separate language used by the common people as a “spoken” language (premature form of the modern Turkish which had some foreign influence)
The TDK basically got rid of the rag bag now known to be Ottoman Turkish (which some historians attribute to be a bureaucratic jargon) and laid the basis of the modern Turkish language
ALMOST EVERYTHING CHANGED
Subsequent with the foundation of the association and the adoption of the latin alphabet, some archaic words from Old-Turkic were resurrected and -thanks to the agglutinative nature of Turkish- some new words were created
Much of the newly adopted words from that era (1930s) were accepted by the public, and some were left unused
I would’ve liked to list a few words as an example, but since this comment is now extremely long, I am just going to leave a Wikipedia article on the replacement of loanwords in Turkish:
Long story short, the movement never came to an end
The TDK is still regulating the language and trying to come up with new words to replace the loan ones
Hope that it had interested you
There was a movement but people stopped to care
Only big influence it made was the word "uçak" instead of "teyyare" (which is Arabic) for the word plane
They tried to implement "özçekim" for selfie
But not many people use it today
I tought France was one of the best at that
France is famous for protecting its language from loanwords here
I confuse eight and six, because six is “altı” and eight is “sekiz” which sounds like six in my native language
The word archieve is "arşiv" in Turkish
I assumed they would be pronounced similar as other words that are similar with english like corner and "korner". But believe me they sound really different and I realised that this year
Apperently we pronounce archieve like French not English
Erdogan
On one point he or someone from his party said they are the one who put fridge in house, They are the one who brought water to Istanbul
Some of his followers make him look like, Turkey wasn’t even exist before him, see him like same as Muhammed in some cases higher than him
One woman said “we didn’t have touch screen telephone before Erdogan(means before 2002), we need thank for Erdogan because he makes the deals”. In free market that Turkey has
Soren Kierkegaard
Yes, true
I haven’t met a person in my life that does say ridicule things about Ataturk
Yes, I [worship(people meaning)] him as well
But this doesn’t make me not see his mistakes or treat him as a god
He is a human being with respectful vision for Turkey
I am sure most of people you ask will say similar things like this
One more thing, usage of his picture has increased because Erdogan wanting to erase him and his legacy
[A comment for greater explanation
I honestly don’t think like you
I am a Kemalist and a real follower of the ideas of Kemalism such as:
•Anti Imperialism
•Fulfilled independence
•Turkish Nationalism
•Laicism
But the thing is that Ataturk and his ideals are not thought well enough to the people
Most so-called “Ataturkists” don’t know what he and the nation movement stood for
While Erdoğan tryinf to destroy Ataturk’s legacy those people can not defend Ataturk
Neither can CHP
Erdoğan is trying to surpass Laicism while CHP is letting him to do so
Opposition is miserable and unable to defend the Kemalism
Such party who had once beated imperialist down in Anatolia and buried them into the waves of Medditernean Sea now is following a smooth ideology called Social Democracy
Kemalism is smoothened
The idea of anti-imperialism is destroyed by our application into Nato and the Kemalists and (Obligatory) militarist wiev of our military is completely destroyed by the 2008 Ergenekon and Balyoz plots
Kemalist wiev is dying day by day but the main reason is not Erdoğan it is the so called leftists-Ataturkists passive attitudes and ignorancy of those people
If we could really understand mustafa kemal’s ideals Turkey would be such a different state
I havent see anyone unironically supporting the examples you gave but i know some religious people who dont believe in evolution
There is Flat-Earth Foundation(just one person i guess)
I don’t think majority doesn’t know climate change other than its name
Vaccinates are free so there are few people might exist
But we are ruled by anti-science government so
Anti-Intellectualism is certainly a thing here but i haven’t come across to any antivaxxers, flatters or climate change deniers
Though homeopathy, conspiracies, metaphysics and the occult are very popular here
Doctors prescribing sessions with a wizard clerics or engineers talking about ghosts are common things here
Armenians still hate us, but I doubt they liked us before the gennocide anyway
I mean [Sevres Syndrome] is still alive and mostly defines our foreign relations, so yep, WW1 has a definite effect on our foreign relations
Agreed
I doubt we'll even come close to that in the next decade so don't get your hopes up
Eh, my belidf would have been that if the Ecevit governemnt in the early 2000s hadn't collapsed and AKP hadn't come to government that Turkey would be in or near the EU today but I do understand that there's a power dynamic in the EUP which would be practically destroyed if Turkey joined
The DSP-MHP-ANAP coalition started those reforms but fell apart after the 2001 financial crisis in Turkey, due to poor economic management of the 80s and early 90s, for the death penalty,it hadn't been used since 1991 and needed to be approved by the parliament for it's use and most of those cases were converted into 10 years of prison in a pardon, as for the use of Kurdish language there was nothing aganist it from what I know what AKP did,which was one of the few good things they did, was allowing the Kurdish language to be taught in schools
For the negotiations before AKP we were negotiating to enter the single-market which would've lead into the EU negotiations and almost every party other RP and maybe MHP had a goal to enter the EU so those reforms would have happened no matter what
Yea I can understand that as the EU already has to help countries like Bulgaria,Romania etc
already but maybe in the future

I think you meant mayor instead of major
*Reads the title question*
What the
*Reads the text*
Wow, this is great information
Not that you asked, but younger people seem more nostalgic about the Ottoman Empire than the older generation who are more devoted to the Turkish Republic
Of course the current Erdogan regime supports the empire ideology and that's one reason but also the Turkish population is getting more ignorant about how badly the last Ottoman emperors fucked up, thanks to the historical TV series and lack of history education
One of the last ones, Abdülhamit II, which is so praised today sold Cyprus to UK for gold
Some of the new generation dream of going back to those times also because the future looks really bleak
Fun fact: Ottoman emperors hardly had any Turkish blood
Assuming the first emperor Osman was 100% Turkish, his descendants almost exclusively married non-Turks, mostly non-muslims in fact, and eventually the original "Turkish blood" was highly diluted
In any case, they wouldn't consider themselves Turks but Ottomans and "Turk" was mostly a dirty word, which changed only by the start of Turkey
That's why it is surprising why people of Turkey would own this history so much, but they do
Ottoman
The original question does not say anything about colonial empires
If you have Kurdish name you are from eastern Turkey
Easy to Spot
Or if you have Islamic names you are from Central Anatolia because central anatolia most islamist part of Turkey
If you have original Turkish names you are probably from Western Turkey

Amazing channel if you want to discover 70s rock music
They mostly have english subtitles too
[This] is the worst in my opinion
Her screams make the song unbearable
Gülseren - Rimi Rimi Ley
(2005)
It has a really dark story behind it
The singer Gülseren didn't want to participate with this song
She said it was an awful song and the outfits were ridiculous
When it was time to leave Istanbul and head to Kiev, a woman in charge said "Her thighs are too big, she shouldn't represent us
" Gülseren says that they literally measured her thighs before going
She says she felt like an absolute animal, a puppet
After the contest, she got into severe depression
She was put into medical care multiple times
She lost all her jobs
She recieved so many harsh critics and at one point she considered commiting suicide
Her career was over
Today, she is trying to make a living by being a music teacher
"Çekya" is much more better than "Çek Cumhuriyeti", so I prefer Czechia
Czechia sounds sexy
Yes I do, because nobody calls it the "Federal Republic of Germany" or the "Hellenic Republic" except when you're speaking formally right
You just say "Germany" or"Greece". So why should we make an exception for Czechia
We still want to use Czechoslovakia because we have a famous tongue twister that goes like:
"Siz bizim Çekoslovakyalılaştırabildiklerimizden misiniz ya da Çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklamızdan mısınız?"
And that means
Are you the ones we could make Czechoslovak or are you the ones we couldn't make Czechoslovak

Our current flag is pretty cool
I don't really like the previous ones tbh
I like todays flag the most
Kıskanmak = to be jealous
İmrenmek = to envy
Kıskanmak can be used for envy but never the other way around
It blows my mind how european languages have ton of dialects while Turkic languages maybe have 1 or 2
Mostly people in rural areas speak in their dialect
Turkish, Azerbaijani and Turkmen are from the Oghuz branch of the Turkic language family so communicating is a bit easier than Kazakh
I understand 70-80% of Azerbaijani and 50-60% of Turkmen but i hardly understand Kazakh i can only catch some words if it's spoken slowly
Usually Biontech or Pfizer-Biontech
I never saw it referred to as just Pfizer
For example the minister of health refers to it as only Biontech [here] but that's the more common unofficial usage
News websites usually call it Pfizer-Biontech: example [1] [2] [3]
I think another reason media refers to as Biontech is because it is easy to pronounce
Pfizer is hard to pronounce for average Turk who doesn’t speak german
Yes, that was an important factor, one of the researchers even gave an interview in Turkish
That is true, Turkish people have a hard time pronouncing foreign words
But also keep in mind that Pfizer is not really a new brand in Turkey
They even had a factory at a very prime location right next to the Bosphorus in Istanbul
Their products are in literally every pharmacy
I just looked up his interview with the BBC to compare
He definitely has an accent in Turkish too but it's much lighter than the one he has in English

We also have multiple thank yous in turkish
One of  the most used ones literally translates as "be alive" lol

It was forbidden to wear headscarf or any religious dress while working in government bodies and students with a headscarf were not allowed in universities till 2008
Even we don't eat snails, we export a significant amount of snails to Europe
Turkey gave full equality to the women before many European countries like UK and France
A word can have maybe 10 meanings by different pronouncing styles
Even a profanity can be like this too
Oh btw, we have profanities you can't even imagine
It's history doesn't start with the Ottomans or Seljuks
Surpassing a religious people caused to elect Erdogan  government
Now he is using religion as a control tool and for getting votes
Citizen of Turkey are weird
Rule 1: Do not use anything that you learnt from Turks
Rule 2: Do not say I am bored
There is a good chance you may accidentally say I am fucked
Ok, I will tell you longest profanity I found:

Vatan Partisi, founded by the meme of a man named Dogu Perincek who only gets 0
6 every election
The party is pro-Russia, yet also pro-Communist, but also Kemalist, and yet also extremely Nationalist
Now you might think does anyone take them seriously
To which the answer is very, very rarely
Pirate parties usually promise protection of data, uncensored and free internet and surveying the government on their doings
At least the Turkish pirate party promises these
But the Dutch one seems funny with pirated content lol
It does translate as the "Patriotic Party" in English
Vatan means homeland in Turkish as well, but "Partisi" doesn't exacty mean dedicated, though there seems to be a possible connection
"Partisi" just means "the party of", and is the agglunated version of "Parti", which just means "Party".

Looks very small on the map but one of the major powers in the middle east

I prefer foreign memes
Turkish tv sucks ass
Its a big source for memes ofc
Çanakkale Gelibolu (Gallipoli)
I was in middle school when I first went to Gallipoli
We saw the Çanakkale Martyrs’ Memorial
We’ve been to monuments for both sides
I remember reading the tomb stones
The soldiers weren’t much older than me
Most of them were barely even 20
It was so saddening to realise that these boys had to die to protect their lands and the others were dying for someone else’s cause
They had people who loved them, family, a girlfriend, fiancé. Maybe they had goals to accomplish in life
They had dreams that now were lost forever
It was a heartbreaking and eye opening experience at the same time
It was in school, 10th grade(Sex Ed only)
They talk about this with separate boys and girls
So boys left for girls to learn, girls left for boys to learn
First talks starts about becoming adult and puberty around 7th or 8th grade
in high schools and the family etc but not enough you're learning it with your experiances
isn’t 6th grade too early
What do you mean separately
Ours was in bio class and everyone was naturally together
Our Sex ED was in Biology as well
Teacher let girls out and only boys were in the class for an hour to talk about male part of the job and visa versa for once
It was very detailed class
Most of the other stuff about Sex ED was together in the class
Oh then it is accurate
It is same here as well I thought it like just talking about sex, STDs, projection from STD etc
I thought it as STD, Intercourse, etc
I still think for 11 years old that having sex, STD, etc as young for them to learn
Maybe in age 13-14 would be better for explaining age
I didn’t think it as start of puberty but stuff about puberty is right age to start
Never knew they made it separately
The one in the middle school was separate in my experience too but not high school
Where was your school, if I may ask
It was in Çukurova/Adana
It was an old high school as well
Teacher didn’t change in more than 10 years when I was student there
In primary school, ours wasn’t separate but in high school
We had couple of Sex ED
Like in 9th was about puberty mostly
In 10th it was an actual Sex ED anything you need to know about(only separate one and was detailed one with you can ask any question)
In 11th it was just an seminar about sex
My point is not about encouraging nor they can’t be taught
I just don’t like the idea of 11 years old kid to think about sex just to learn about it
Age 12 we learnt about thing our body are going to go through, etc
This is normal thing to learn
But intercourse or STD, in my opinion, is not that this age to learn about
OP explained about it as puberty and I understand it wrong at first
Turkey(or rather, the Ottoman Empire) hosted a large number of Polish refugees escaping Tsarist and Prussian repression
They even rose to high governmental positions like Governor of Syria
Another Turco-Polish tidbit: The Ottomans never recognized the partitions of Poland, and would intentionally annoy Austrian and Russian diplomats by asking where the Polish representatives were
Australians and New Zealanders
Our only historical interaction was fighting against each other in Gallipoli
While the war was brutal, it was also exceptionally gentlemanly, especially between Anzac troops and Turks
During a commemorative event, Ataturk gave a famous and friendly speech
Australia built a statue of him
Then we named their landing point after them (anzac cove)
One thing led to another and the public sentiment towards Anzac troops are extremely friendly now while the British are portrait as the ruthless, greedy imperial power that sent innocent people from the other side of the world to their deaths
We have relations with Jews and Israel, current government is anti-Israel but many Turks and Jews love each other
During WW2 Turkish government saved many jews from nazis
Government said "They are our people, release them
" so nazis released and we gave turkish pasaports to them
This is why there are more jews in Turkey than any other muslim majority country
Ottomans apperently helped Ireland with the famine which became known in Turkey recently thanks to some youtube videos
India but its more of a trivia
The english call the bird turkey because they bought it through Istanbul and called it Turkey Coq, later becoming just turkey
We however brought it from India and called it Hindi
Which means Indian
Here's an article that explains it better than I do: [
Qajars never recognized it too
And I think Polish people still remembers and respects us for not recognizing their partition
I’ve lived couple of months in Szczecin, Poland in 2017/2018
One day while I was shopping at a store the owner and I got into a conversation and I told him I am from Turkey
Then he immediately mentioned about us never recognizing their partition, and the guy actually played Civilization V Suleiman theme from the speakers in store
And he gifted me a Polish flag key chain
That was definitely a day to remember
The story told here is that Sultan Abdulmecid decides to send 10
000 pounds
But the british ambassador tells him that would be inappropriate, since Queen victoria is only donating 2000 pounds
So instead he sends 1000 pounds and 3-5 ships of food
Wiki page seems to have the sources to back it up
Just habsburg things
I keep comparing western european wages to mine
Shit's depressing
Albanian Muslim Father
Jewish Mother
My father is one of the Albanians that fled to Istanbul during Balkan Wars and when asked his nationality he says he's Turkish
My mom's ancestors are the Jews that fled to Ottoman Empire from Spain hundreds of years ago
When asked she says she's Jewish
Because I was born into a mixed-religion family, my parents let me choose my religion by telling me about both Islam and Judaism
I choose neither
But, I like the cultures of my parents a lot
I celebrate Hanukkah with my mom and my dad joins in too
Mom and I also don't leave dad alone during Ramadan when he fasts
When asked about my nationality, I say I'm a Half-Jewish Turk
Why do I say I'm Turkish even though I probably don't have any % of Turkic DNA in my blood
Well, to that I say: Turkish is my first language, I was born in Turkey and so are my parents
That's it
Unlike many people think, it is "İstanbul", not "Istanbul".
Yeah honestly I find the sound of their names quite lovely
They don’t have any translations to English but I haven’t seen any foreigner pronounce them right
Weirdly the French are always the best at doing it
We have a city named [Batman] .
Afyonkarahisar=Opium Black Castle<---this one is my favourite
Kırklareli=Place of Fourties
Şanlıurfa=Glorious Urfa
Gaziantep=Veteran Antep
Kahramanmaraş=Heroic Maraş
Denizli=With Sea (this city does not have a coast even though the city is called with sea)
+Bodrum <---this place is not a city but a direct translation means Basement
Kırıkkale=Brokencastle
Eskişehir=Old City
Tekirdağ=Tabby Mountain
Düzce=Kinda Flat
Well, I like them in Turkish
But everyone calls Istanbul "Constantinople". And that's something I don't like, bro the Byzantine Empire is gone, it's Istanbul now, get over it
I think we pronounce it quite right because we write it Sofya and reading it like this puts the stress on the “o”.
I have heard Bulgarians say it and it’s almost identical to us
The English often pronounce it like Sophia
Thank you I’m looking forward to visit France too
After all of that virus bullshit
About the “ı” that sound is actually pretty popular especially in Slavic countries too
It’s like “u” in difficUlt”.
We also have a lot of Turkified French words in our language
Yeah, they had a crazy mayor
He also had that crazy project to change the city borders so it would look like Batman symbol on the map
Ah yeah it did indeed . I think they sued DC comics though
The city is a joke itself though it was literally manufactured not to hurt people’s feeling who are from there
Batman was a village and then oil was discovered close to it so a lot of workers moved in and it grew pretty fast
It’s the only place you can become a professional Batman though studying in [Batman University]
Niğde is a place like that and fun fact it literally means “nowhere” in a lot of Slavic languages
Near Salt Lake
I was a old memory but I remember it as plane area with no buildings for a long time
The more far it gets from sea, the more desolated it becomes
Central Anatolia is a fine example
I always wonder if there’s a relation
Everybody tries to move to a bigger city for oppotunities, employement and better lifestyle
Villages already look dead to me
However, due to COVID and how Istanbul becoming unlivable place changed to opposite lately
White-collars took remote working as an opportunity to leave Istanbul and move small Aegean sea-towns
Also during the last year was the first time Istanbul lost its population
While Izmir (the 3rd biggest city) has on high demand because it's smaller city than İstanbul with more secular population compare to rest of the country
Black Sea region is growing as well
Even my family is considering moving back full time instead of a couple of months a year
Is it due to COVID
Nah
Mostly due to stress Istanbul has been causing
Most people don't even have an opinion about how to play rugby
Milks and eggs are not in the refrigerator section at the market but we refrigerate them at home cuz no one likes lukewarm milk ...
I refrigerate some of the eggs and leave some of them outside
I usually have too much eggs
I start to refrigerate milk after it is opened
Not at all
"Can you pack the remains
" is a pretty common question waiters receive in Turkey
Not wasting food is a big deal for many people so taking the remains home can even be seen as a good trait
Turkish QWERTY with ı, ğ, ç, ş, ö, ü on computer
English QWERTY on phone because of my thick thumbs there's not enough space for all buttons
We have F Keyboard but most people use QWERTY with Turkish diacritics (ı, ğ, ü, ş, ö, ç)
While having asked for something you want you sometimes say no though you want it
In Canada, I realized most people did not cover their mouths when yawning
It just felt weird and disgusting to me
I meant close it with your hand
Our constitution has a famous loophole
Article 4 Says article 1,2,3 can’t be changed but you can change article 4 then change article 1,2,3
Management style
- Article 1: The State of Turkey is a Republic
Characteristics of the Republic
- Article 2: The Republic of Turkey, public peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights; loyal to the nationalism of Atatürk, initially based on the fundamental principles of a democratic, secular and social state of law
Unity, Official Language, Flag, National Anthem and Capital of the State
- Article 3: The State of Turkey is an indivisible entity with its territory and nation
Its language is Turkish
Its flag is a white crescent and star and red flag, the shape of which is specified in the law
Its national anthem is the "National Anthem". The capital city is Ankara
Unchangeable Provisions
- Article 4: The provision stating that the form of the State in Article 1 of the Constitution is a Republic, and the qualifications of the Republic in Article 2 and the provisions of Article 3 cannot be changed and proposed to be changed
If you have a doctor report about a mental illness you can still sue people but people can not sue you for anything
Malicious people abuse this like they insult people online and if people reply to their insult with a similar wording, they basically sue you and profit if they win the court
Sounds crazy but some people do this professionally and the government is not doing anything about this
"Seni seviyorum
Geceyi aydınlatan ay misali senin parlayan gözlerin ışık saçıyor gönlüme
Your eyes shines to my heart like the moon who brightens the night
Allahına kurban
Are u szekely
You guys love eachother there
Don’t y’all take 4 wifes
Can u love 4 woman at the same time
Guzum hırkanı giy de üşütmen
Which one do you prefer
Romania or Hungary
Kebab
I hope one day this tyrannic saudi dynasty will parish and people of arabia will see a more equal,secular and modern society
But you must deserve in the first place
Do you have autonomy in Romania such as education in mother tongue
Literally changed the constitution and switched from parliamentary to presidential system (Turkey)
So many things that I can't list here without getting exhausted
Most recently though, he didn't like the results of the Istanbul election as the opposition won by a very slight difference in votes
He deemed it illegitimate and forced another election
People were angry this time and the opposition won with 1 million votes more than the ruling party's candidate
Furthermore, his party is specialised in election fraud
Be more civil and put them in jail so they can’t talk
Dont get me wrong, but are milk-white skinned people able to get a tan
^(Sorry If this sounds offensive
But my mom can only turn into a tomato
Eastern and Central Anatolian accents sound rude and uneducated
Cypriot, Western Anatolian and European accents sound funny and uneducated
Foreign accents are considered cute and funny unless they are Arabic or Farsi, you can face some bad behaviour if you have Arabic or Farsi accents mainly because of the refugees
Other Turkic accents and dialects especially the Central Asian ones sound strong, pure and mighty
Azerbaijani sounds old and Ottoman like
Nearly everyone speaks İstanbulite Turkish in media
(Edited)
Agree with everything except Azeri(?) sounds like the opposite of the way Ottoman elite were speaking
Normal Turkish folk used to speak like Azeri people speaking now back in the day too
No one spoke like the Ottoman elite except for themselves
Yes, foreign accents are mostly considered normal and acceptable but local or native Turkish accents are seemed informal and a sign of lack of education
It actually doesnt mean they are uneducated but somehow people developed the idea of other accents other than Istanbul accent sound uneducated and this causes other accents to disappear so its not a nice thing and this attitude needs to change in my opinion
No, no one cares
In here we have something like that but they are just after your money and it's actually legal somehow
They come take your money an go but if you don't give them they may even kill you
Chicken Breast Pudding/Tavuk Göğsü is a dessert made with Chicken Breast, milk, sugar and flour
Typically most Europeans only know baklava as a Turkish dessert but Chicken Breast Pudding is delicious too
Please learn anything except Döner "Kebab". Döner isn't a kebab properly guys
We literrally have the same food but we call it Kokoreç. Its delicious
Mizeria seems like it could be a distant cousin of tzatziki
It sounds pretty good
I don't understand how kebabs and baklava somehow became the face of Turkish cuisine because I eat those maybe 5 times a year in total and most people can't even afford red meat
I think most people are also aware of things like sarma/dolma and börek, which are far more commonly eaten
I choose: [mantı] meat dumplings with yogurt, [midye dolma] (stuffed mussels), and [kazandibi] caramelised chicken pudding but trust me the chicken has no taste, it's only there for a chewy texture
Also [lakerda] which I put here just because I like it, and [imambayıldı] which I could eat every day
boza is pretty common in turkey too
and şiş kebap in turkish cuisine
Tripe Soup is delicious with garlic, pepper and vinegar
About Döner, well, nobody counts Döner as kebab in Turkey
I don't think I can explain the difference but one day if you visited Turkey, you could see the people, situation and understand why we think like that, probably
You ate everything except the emperor of the street foods, shame on you, really
You should try it when you came here again
Are you talking about [Ayran]
Wait, how do you make  Döner in Germany
It can't be differ much right
I know you use some sauces (sauces are no no) but
>boquerones
That looks closer to something I know as levrek marin, which I make the day before I want to eat it
Lakerda has to wait a few weeks (minimum) before being eaten
> I've talked to throughout Europe also recognized it as a German dish
We got used to see our dishes with Greek names (add a Turkish name -ki suffix and have a Greek food .d)  in West but German spin-off is kinda strange lol
I have tried surströmming, I was 100% prepared to hate it but done properly it wasn't actually that bad
Lakerda is more along the lines of smoked salmon imo, but much saltier and without being smoked
Not much actually
But I should try "German" Döner if I visited Germany for a good comparison and seeing the differences
18, also 2 of the 7 wonders of the ancient world are located here
Everyone should see the well-known sights in Istanbul
But Ephesos, by far, is the most amazing place I've ever been to

We turks discuss about menemen
Onion gang and not onion gang always hate each other
Whether or not sarma/dolma has meat
I grew up with non meaty sarma so I like it better
Personally, I think the meat represses the smell and taste of grape leafs and lemon
Hate is a strong word to use but come on, menemen has onions
tbh every conversation can end up as a food conversation in turkey
I like onions but adding onions to menemen will ruin it and I won't be convinced otherwise
people who eat menemen without onion are psychopaths and should be hanged till death
Truer words never been spoken
Turkland for sure, I'm getting tired of the bird jokes
or Turkia
Something other than a fucking bird name that's for sure
I don't know what I would change it to
Just not Turkey
Oh man, i would definitely change it to something like Turkia or something like that
Something non ethical like "Republic of Anatolia" but Turkey has got some lands over Anatolia and even this comment probably make anger some nationalist redditors, I can't even imagine how people get mad
So maybe something like Turkia, Turkland
*Republic of Asia Minor*, or *Western Asian Republic* or any other name which doesn't make it look like the country is the exclusive property of a single race of people
*Turkey, Turkland, Turkistan*, etc
all make it sound like the country is for Turks only
Turkiye sounds too Persian to my ears, if I could I'd change the Turkish name to "Türkeli" anyhow
Turkland
Sounds nice, explains that it is a land inhabited by Turks
My inspiration for "Turkia" came from Romance languages really
Person who asked the question asked for English name
Well, there are two issues with that:
1) Turkey covers more than just Anatolia, Turkey owns a large amount of land in Mesopotamia and the Caucasus, along with Thrace
2) The word has a poor connotation in Turkey(at least in official usage), as it was(and still is) used by numerous Kurdish nationalist and Maoist terrorist insurgencies
Yes, which I talked about as well, if you had read my original comment
Ahahahah :) -eli is just the Old Turkic version of -stan, nice coincidence though
Exactly, Türkistan is already used(and it could create an impression of being Middle Eastern in English)
Yes, but Turkestan actually DOES exist already
&#x200B;
Oh and, I really dislike Persian loanwords
I'd rather not use -stan
Well, yeah, but it should also be remembered that most of Central and West Asia was under Persian cultural dominance for centuries
That aside, the suffix -stan is used a LOT in Turkish itself(Bulgaristan/Bulgaria, Yunanistan/Greece, Hindistan/India, et cetera)
I personally don't like it since it's a sad attempt for people to show off in most cases and I'm not a billboard but people wear clothing with logos in Turkey
Why is this a thing in Switzerland
Are the apartments too small
Came to agree with the Greek poster
I'm pretty sure we'll be rid of erdoboy in the next election
They already lost Istanbul in local elections
Good thing is, the years of lawlessness and government oppression have "radicalized" the opposition parties for the better
So I'm expecting for a swift recovery
You're welcome to boycott but any sort of open hostility from Europe just gives erdo more PR material, for his bs "taking on the world" image
Just to put your mind at ease:
I am not the head of state obviously but I can say with confidence that war is not a possibility to anyone here
Jets can dogfight, ships could collide(hopefully with no casualties) but I don't think anyone is even considering war here
"-oğlu" means "son of ..."
Whateveroğlu: Son of Whatever
It is actually useful to have a well-known language in the world
English is nice but it would be better if it was french honestly
It pretty much achieved what Esperanto couldn't so I like it
Absolutely not
If it wasn't English, it would have been French or German or some other high-prestige language
Some parts of the world still use other lingua francas where English could not make the effect it made in other parts
E.g. Swahili
or japanese
Iran because of if USA uses NATO as response to conflict, I guess Turkey can be the first target
Syrian and Iraq as non-stable countries which already threatening more countries just than Turkey as refugees
Also having land border makes it worse
Russia, aggression to Ukraine and Georgia which if it escalates, I am guessing NATO will say something when it is near to full invasion of either countries
While I don't currently see any threat, but we do not get along well with most of our neighbors (Armenia, Greece, Syria) and we still have disputes to this day
So, there's that
Bulgaria: I cant see any real problem with them for 31 yrs
Relations are getting better everyday as i observe
So, nope
Greece and Cyprus: I guess
no need to explain
Syria: Yes, it is influenced by Iran with tons of Shia militias, and influenced by Russia a lot
Iraq: Not really, even for Peshmerga (a. k. a. Iraqi Kurdistan)
We have quite good relations with them
But for sure, if Turkey would be more weaker than now, then Peshmerga could be a real threat for us
Iran: YES
They seem really extremist and i think there can/will be only one local power in middle east
This whole stuff depends on USA elections a lot
I love Trump cuz he is a Pro-Turkey and Pro-Israel president
Absolute opposite of Obama
Azerbaijan: Surely not
Two countries, one nation
Armenia: Not a threat for us but a real threat for Azerbaijanis
Georgia: Not a single problem
So, nope again
2 months ago when we opened the Greek border,Erdogan didn't open Bulgarian border,so i think he likes you
you shall fear from the glorious stronk sealand
mediterranian is a silent battlefield in these days buddy  :)
It depends who you refer; branch of PKK, they should feel threaten, a random Syrian shouldn’t. But my point was over refugee crisis
This is not first time that Turkey has taken refugees
>it could be interesting to see the way you see the situation with those countries
Is there any other way to see it
Greeks tried to kill all the turks("genocide" as europeans likes to call it) in Cyprus to unite Cyprus and Greece, like 50 years ago
Oh comment section looks like a mess to me
Let me explain the story for 2019-2020
We have problems on Aegean and Mediterranian Sea for nearly 30 yrs
But in these days the real problem is the declarations of exclusive economic zones
In Eastern Mediterranian Sea, huge amount of natural gas reserves found a few yrs ago
We were dealing with coup and stuff on those days
So we couldnt deal with it
But Greece and Cyprus started to rent some parts of their(?) sea to some energy companies
Nearly 1 year ago, Turkey went to the UN with a theory that Libyan and Turkish nations' exclusive economic zones are meeting on somewhere on the sea
We had this deal with the UN-recognized democraric gov
of Libya
They are struggling against Khalifa Haftar these days in civil war
By that way, we got into Libyan civil war too and Greece got rly mad
Cuz they were thinking those areas are belong to their own exclusive economic zone
You will ask "why are they thinking like that
" They have a very very little island (you cant see it on the map without a zoom) standing around Antalya
And they bound that little island's economic zone to mainland's one
By that way, we cant meet with the Libyan zone
And by that way we can lose our last ally in the Eastern Mediterranian
Another topic is, we got attacked by Russians for 3 times in Syria 3 months ago
EU and NATO decided to not help us with our struggling against Russians, so we let the refugees leave our country through their way on Europe
But why we did that
Because Assad and Russia were trying ro get Idlib province and Idlib had 2 millions of population
We couldnt handle with another migration wave
We had high border tensions with Greece cuz of the refugee wave
Shortly answered
I dont know the EU membership stuff good enough
In Turkey, ppl are aware of that we wont be a part of EU never, also ppl dont wanna be a part of EU too
IDK why we re still contacting for this
About French, yeah actually
We sided with you, Qatar and the British on Mediterranian
We are observing a real chess play going on against France, Greece, Cyprus, Egypt, Saudis and UAE in Libya civil war
Israel seems like gotta change sides
That is why i didnt count them
I didn't agree with you,I want to be a part of EU
Also Israel wasn't an enemy of us,we became rival to them,because of Erdogan
>But keep in mind that both communities commited atrocities
>And you always seem to omit the fact that you invades Cyprus in order to protect The Turkish Cypriots but you ended up staying forever and stared sending illegal settlers to the island
I agree with these partly
Partly because even if there wasnt a second invasion Turkish Cypriots were still gonna stay there forever because it was their right and if there wasnt a second invasion UN would probably recognize the country so more settlers would come anyway
I did not explain the full situation because i dont have to
Question was do you feel threatened by your neighbor countries and i explained why Turks may feel threatened by Cyprus or Greeks what happened after that doesnt matter in this context
Turkey is the first Muslim majority country that recognizes Israel
Sure, Israel was our ally till AKP pop up
But, be realistic please
%50-60 of Turkish ppl care about Palestinians idk why
Even though they were the first Arabs rebelling us :)
But if you ask me, idc them and wanna be partners with Israel again, surely
can you speak it
yeah, you're right
We haven't been a world superpower for over a hundred years, we also aren't one today
Islam will never be moderate or tolerant
And we were really bad at it
Beginning of 1630’s when [Hezarfen Ahmed Çelebi] flew over Bosphorus would be a nice scene to escape
Also it could have [Lagari Hasan Çelebi] to show a successful manned rocket flight
Murat IV was restrict ruler
He banned coffee, alcohol and tobacco
But he died from Alcohol Addiction
By the time, [Evliya Çelebi] was about to starts its journey which will last over 50 years
He travelled to Europe, Ottoman Empire and ended in Egypt
The game can be life time journey of an assassin
1633 - Fire broke out 3 part of the Constantinople, burnt a fifth of the city
During this journey, [Kösem Sultan] was getting more powerful in Ottoman Empire
And became one of the most powerful woman in the Empire
Other one would be this: [Ashina Jiesheshuai] raiding palace with 40 men
Independence War and the Republican Era that follows
The country went through so many changes, I’d like to experience it unfold
There already has been an AC game set in the Ottoman Empire, but if I had to choose another time period, I'd say Istanbul during WW2
Çomars
Didnt read kuran but ready to die for his religion, doesnt know anything about economy, but %100 sure that europe is jealous with our budget
Doesnt know why but keeps voting for akp and erdoğan
Tırreks/Kekos:For those who have no brain due to excessive usage of drugs
They like to blast their distinctive music from their old ass cars
They also like to prey on girls in front of high schools and parks
Usually begs for 50 kuruş (to buy a glue to inhale and trip to) and threatens you if you refuse
For some reason all of tırreks love football and usually a fanatic
Çomars:Çomar is the name of a dog breed but for some reason we use the same name to name our stupid,conservative and ignorant af people
They're usually lower middleclass and they like to own Fiat Doblo's.They're obsessed with Ottoman Empire and approve Erdoğan because of this claims to revive Ottoman Empire
They dislike every religion but Islam(they're obsessed about it aswell)They like to deny every fact that could potentially hurt Erdoğan government
They claim that there's nothing wrong with the country and would like to label everybody who oppose them as "traitor to the country".
Arizona kertenkeleleri (Arizona lizards)
I know it sounds weird
[This guy is one of them
Fun fact: Even though the guy in the picture doesn't wear one, they usually wear adidas here as well
Ours change names every now and then
But in general, they are called "Barzo", "Apaçi" (EN: Apache) or most currently, "Arizona Kertenkelesi" (EN: Arizona Lizard)
Their behavioral pattern is more or less similar to the groups mentioned by the OP
A quick search on youtube gave me [this
Barzo
How are they like
I assume they're not much open to residents of the country but other Turks
(at least that's the case for Turks living in Germany)
Oh that's really interesting
Thanks for the reply
70s was Anatolian Rock which I personally consider to be the golden age of Turkish music, especially the psychedelic pieces:
unfortunately the genre died down in the 80s
Just wanted to tag in Anatolian Rock Revival Project channel on Youtube, which has amazing pieces from that era of Turkish music
&#x200B;
For those who don't know, the genre didn't died down slowly by the way, the 1980 coup and the subsequent censorship and prosecutions of artists killed it pretty much immediately as the 80s began
Man wish I lived those times
Eh, as great was 70s Turkish music was, it wasn't a good time and place to live in
Constant political violence, economic crisis, US embargo and more
Hey buddy, there are also some tribute albums to the 70s and 80s Turkish Folk Rock, same songs by different artists
You might like it I supppose
Some examples;
You can also check Haluk Levent for modern folk rock;
You might be right I don't really know about politics
Azerbaijani : About 95%, almost native, sounds like a Turkish dialect
Turkmen: It's very close and I can understand it pretty well written, spoken it's a little harder
Uzbek : A little less than Azerbaijani but still very close, imagine Turkish spoken with an Iranian accent
Kazakh-Kyrgyz : It sounds similar and we use some common words but otherwise it's a little hard to understand
For French : I can understand Spanish if it's spoken not too fast(About 60-70%),
Italian and Romanian are a bit different, easier written
And Portuguese is almost unintelligible(at least for me)
I can understand Azerbaijani without a problem I can understand Crimean Tatar and Gagauz
But when it comes to Central Asia it becomes very hard,of course  I can understand most of the words but I cant understand when someone speaks
As a Turk I understand 90 percent of azerbaijani but Turkmen thats different
I only understand 50-60 percent of it
I can understand Azerbaijani pretty well
But I can't say the same about Turkmen
Well as a native Turkish speaker i can easily understand Azerbaijani but im unable to form a sentence
Tho it is really easy to communicate
Azerbaijani / Northern Cypriot - 95%/100%
Uzbek / Turkmen - 50%/60%
Kyrgyz / Kazakh - 20%-25%
...and that's about it
If they speak slow, i can understand Azerbaijani pretty well
Also its easier in their written language
But i can’t say the same for Kazakh, Kyrgyz etc
just some words i can understand
Azerbaijani: I can pretty much understand it without effort
There are some words that I don't know but with context it's kind of easy
Turkmen: I can kind of understand this too
Understanding this is harder than understanding Azerbaijani but still not that difficult
Crimean Tatar: Arguably more understandable than Turkmen
Kazakh: Not so much
I can understand some words and some sentences but overall it's difficult to understand
as a turk
azerbajani %99
tatar %98
gagauz %97
turkmen %87
uzbek %65
krgyz %40
kazakh %39
i can totally understand someone who speaks azerbaijani with zero azerbaijani knowledge
thats right we understand azerbajani same nation
Thank you
no im not
like british and american english
there iş some different words and a little bit accent
As far as I'm aware, around 20% of undergraduate programs use English as a medium of instruction partially or fully
There are a few that teach in German and there's at least one university that teaches exclusively in French
In schools, the language of instruction is only Turkish except for the foreign language subjects
Only Turkish but I doubt it'd work to have bilingual education with anything, considering the schools barely manage to teach basic Turkish grammar
We have a kurdish seperatist and autonomus movements
Seperatist movement isn’t peacefull it is terrorism which killed more than 10
000 people including civillian kurds such as başbağlar massacre
Most kurds don’t support PKK however they want some sorts of autonomy
HDP in the other hand claims to be “peacefull” but it is proven that they had connections with pkk
I hope for a kurdish party which really can defend minority rights without any links to terrorist organizations
Kurds deserve equality and they are sick of PKK
Most kurds would prefer Turkey
Which had been their home more than 1000 years
Unfortunetly education rate is very low in kurdish areas and people are suffering under tribal pattern and religious oppression of those tribe leaders
The kurdish people of turkey can be educated and integrated to the society by a land reform and unifiyng policy
We arw all citizens of this country mo matter our ethnic background from Turk to Kurd laze to zaza we are all Turkish
Kurds but not very close to independence in Turkish soil
They have an obvious power in northern iraq and syria but as i say not close to independence in my country
Kurds have been fighting for independence here roughly since the 70s. The PKK has been an active, terrorist, group since the 70s and there have been and are groups in the Turkish parliament fighting for Kurdish Independence, currently HDP is the largest group fighting for it and they have 64 members( roughly 1/10th of the Parliament)
What else can even leave Hungary anymore
Something like Austria-Hungary or just old Hungarian provences
Turkey doesn't have a problem with Kurdish autonomous groups outside Turkey
Current problem in Syria was USA puppeted Kurdish state on its borders sheltering PKK members
However shitty diplomacy and retarded decisions in Syria lead to the current situation
PKK is a marxist-communist armed organization, recognized as a terrorist by EU and NATO
There is nothing to sugar coat this
Putting all of this to the shoulder of Kurdish citizens of Turkey is just stupid and not fair
Turkey should have acted against all those racist behaviors and xenophobia long time ago
As a citizen, I wish there was a Turkey for every Kurdish citizen happily call home
If we want to do this, we can't expect this to happen by neither pan-islamist parties nor terrorist organizations
Kurds are in Iranian culture group
Their main difference is Kurds are sunni while Iranians are shia
If you wanna see how a “Kurdistan” would look like , just look at Iran
Thats impossible
We are related culturally for a long time
Thats impossible for every nation can have their own state
Thats utopia
Kurds can have their state but it must be outside of Turkey
Poison and Venom means Zehir
To do and To make is Yap-mak
Both Earth and world means "Dünya"
Yüz - hundred, swim, face
Yaz - summer, write
Kaz - goose, dig
At - throw, horse
Dolu - full, hail
Ben - me, mole
İç - drink, inside
Tbf Turkish has a lot of these
Swim - Face - Hundred - Shear, all of them is "yüz" in Turkish
I identify with my city
There are not much Turks where my mother comes from so why would I? When I am abroad I am a *Turk* though
If I want to avoid bs questions I just say that I am Georgian and nobody bats an eye
I identify as my town in another city and Balkanite/Mediterranean when talking to foreigners
I would say from smaller to bigger: I am from Adana; in Mediterranean region; in Turkey
Comfortable
I know how to read "comfor" and "table".
But it's ridiculous when they get together
Squirrel
Doing my major in French definitely effed up my English skills
Out of topic but I’ve recently read Murakami’s Colorless and the Japanese character there goes to Finland
Reading it I wondered why Murakami specifically chose Finland in his novel but not somewhere else
I still can’t find any similarities possibly because I haven’t been to either of those places, so could you please share your thoughts on this so that I can have an insight about Murakami’s choice as well
Argentina, Finland and Korea
Finland and Korea, we have some kind of a strange connection
Argentina is just a Turkey in South America, problems with landowners, neighbouring countries; downfall economy and military juntas etc
You made me curious to search about Finland :)
The tought of a Nordic country that have similarities with Turkey is really interesting
Thanks for the clarification
>Turkey is also more unique compared to some of its neighbours
Turkey is an unique blend of them
Have some aspects from all of them
[Cappadocia] is pretty close to me
It's a completely unique piece of scenery shaped by the volcanic ashes of Erciyes volcano and centuries of water and wind erosion
So other worldly
I'm an high schooler
We've got 2 to 4 lessons a day on Teams, also there are 3 government owned TV channels that streams lessons every day
I’m a substitute teacher in a high school
We use the government’s own app called EBA which uses Zoom
But there’s too much traffic on the app so it’s quite challenging to connect
Teachers use Zoom as an alternative which is so much better
Apart from online courses, you can put videos, documents, tests, tasks etc
on the platform
Alas, most students don’t have access to the internet and the ones that do simply don’t care
And the ones that do care have a hard time to connect the app due to the shitty groundwork
We have 2-3 students attending on average
The numbers become 10+ on STEM courses
Though I should add my school is not the best example because most students have poor socioeconomic statuses
The app is actually really nice but they didn’t prepare enough for it
It’s hard to keep the pace in class when I disconnect several times during lessons
And you only have 1 lesson for every class
For example, I teach English
It’s 5 credits so I had 5 periods for every class
I had 5 classes
Multiply it by 5, you get 25
I had extra classes too but they don’t really matter
So, now I that time is reduced to 1
It’s hard to compose 5 hours worth of material into 1
That’s another challenge of the app
But it had to be so because like I said, the the app simply can’t handle so much traffic
The semester is over for the students
The government is preparing for summer schools so kids can keep up
Otherwise, this whole system won’t do any good on its own
I have online lessons 5 days a week, and about 2-3 hours a day
And we use Microsoft Teams
I mean
we have Batman
And some people say that the borders of the city should be like the Batman symbol
It hasn't happened, yet, but it will be the Istanbul earthquake
The most optimist expectation is 100k death, several millions of homeless people and the complete destruction of the economical capital of Turkey
It'll happen because simply lots of people ignored some basic safety rules
Soma Mine Disaster
About 300 people died
>At a funeral I would follow all the religious rituals
Same for me, but it doesn’t make me religious at all
I: I am Turkish/from Turkey
They: Oh, I’ve been in Turkey, such a great country
I love the history
Especially the food
I can not believe food was excellent
If I was living there for couple more months, I am pretty sure I would roll up way back to home
People are so wholesome, friendly
Coastline is just perfect, I never wanted to leave
I’ve been in this city/this town, etc
(Usually follow up with I give some suggestions about places)
I will go there again as soon as I can
I don’t like Erdogan
How is he getting re-elected after what he has done to country
I live in İzmir
It never snows in İzmir
Nope,none (Brussels)
There was no snow in the city of the worlds desire either
Istanbul didn't get any serious snow yet and it is getting very weird
There is a big flu epidemic and people believe once the snow comes it ends, but the snow is not coming this year
TV Sells were popular in 2000’s, later they moved to least popular channel which usually elders watches then it became a meme lastly they moved to Instagram with their scams
Well, not so popular but the "Laz Baba's Surmene Kitchen Knifes" became popular by teleshopping channels ads
[Kırmızılı Kadın. -Woman in Red

Background Information: Sungur said, “We built first aid tents to help to people who got injured in Taksim Square”. When Sungur, who an academician in City Planning Department of Istanbul Technical University, volunteered to join into protesting to stop bulldozers to demolish Gezi Park, she didn’t have any idea that she would become symbol of the protests
[Edit: [Video of her
You can see her walking slowing after few seconds
[Cümhuriyeti biz böyle kazandık. -This is have we won the Republic
Background Information: This picture was taken at the 10th anniversary of the Republic by Hüsnü Kazım Önder
This is small documentary type of photograph that shows how we did won the Independence War
British English
Maybe just because I can understand it but it sounds pretty cool
Out of the European languages I think it has to be Chuvash
Most ottoman sultans are ethnically more slav than Turkish, and the language they spoke was ottoman language (an artificial language, basically Persian but with many Arabic and Turkish words) idk if that counts
Also, tall man is of Muslim Georgian origin but guess that doesn't count too
I don't know how but we never ruled by foreign dynasties
(Ottomans, Seljuks and probably older Turkic states)
Atatürk was born in Thessaloniki, modern day greece
Though, it was ottoman territory back then, so it doesnt really count
Well, Ataturk was born in what is today Greece, but the place was under Ottoman control at the time so I'm not sure if that counts
Other than that
Nah
our current president, i don't want to use his name to not get on some sort of watchlist or anything by algorithm
They are Oghuz Turks
Aren't we talking about foreign dynasties like Windsor for Britian or Habsburgs for Spain
Well, they born in old Seljuk State so they shouldn't count
I guess
My history teacher said that Serbia started the second balkan war
I told her Serbia was supposed to get Albanian lands but since Albania got independent Serbians took some Macedonian cities and of course Bulgarians wasnt happy with that
She said in the book made by state shows Serbia as the aggresor so she had to teach it like that
Questions in university exam comes from state books so she did what she had to do
"Avalanche kills (insert number) villagers"
"Markups on electricity/natural gas/water fees"
"Cold winds from the Caucasus results in below-freezing temperatures"
In Turkey, that would be our national anthem "Istiklal Marsi" written by Mehmet Akif Ersoy
It is written in 1921 during the Greco-Turkish War
Although Turkish people are familiar with all of the 10 verses, a particularly popular one is as follows:
**Bastığın yerleri “toprak” diyerek geçme, tanı,**
Don't dismiss the ground you set your foot on as "earth", know
**Düşün altındaki binlerce kefensiz yatanı.**
Think on thousands who lay beneath, shroudless
**Sen şehit oğlusun, incitme, yazıktır atanı,**
You are the son of the fallen, don't hurt your ancestor
**Verme, dünyaları alsan da bu cennet vatanı.**
Don't give, even if you are offered Earths, this heavenly motherland
To be honest
Nope
Not a lot of movies I've watched feature Turkey but the ones that do treat us like either
1) Generic Middle Eastern Country
2) Generic Balkan Country
3) Belly dancers and camels
Turkey is not portrayed much in movies, either because what we hold dear as cultural high points, things you'd expect moviemakers to make a great movie out of, are/can be vastly different from west's standards
Or because whenever Turkey IS mentioned in a movie or show, it's either some action scene in Istanbul, or some political state the protagonist has to respond to
Luckily, you'd not be out of something to watch thanks to our own domestic movie industry
There are countless Turkish movies that try to go in line with western production qualities, and have engaging stories
We have a plentiful supply of drama and romance movies, with a fair touch of comedy thanks to Cem Yılmaz, and an almost annual production of some Great War/Ataturk/Çanakkale war romance or drama movie
If you'd like to discover these movies, I suggest you tryt o get a list somewhere, and attempt to find subtitled, or perhaps even fully translated versions of the movies
Or the Midnight Express route, which
yeah
Yesn’t. I’d say Turkey is both European and Asian but also neither
It’s just
its own thing
"Go hiking" near the Syrian border in an active no-go zone
In Turkey, Official name is Hollanda
Does it count
Fun to visit but most people just use it as an inspiration and then go to local manufacturers when they decide on what they want
Local manufacturers are cheaper and the end result is more sturdy
Otherwise university students use it frequently because they don’t have time for things like that
Only NATO should exist if their government allows it
I think İncirlik American Base in Adana should be closed just for USA
There should be a NATO station in rotation like every 4-5  years in every NATO country to learn to work with each other
Shops specifically for Polish stuff is pretty rare if not non existent (in a lot of places)
But we have a village in Istanbul made up of Polish people called Polonezköy/Polonez Köyü(Polish Village) or Adampol
I don't know how many Polish people still live there
The history of revolutions in France never ceases to amaze me
Scottish history
I like Italy's history,especially Rome,city state and rennaissance periods
Romania and Crazy Carol II life style
Early years of the republic probably
It is a highly romanticized era, I would like to see how good we were at time
Just after the (Counter-)Coup of 1909
It was the only proper multi-party democracy we'd get until 1950
Would be quite interesting to see people enjoy their newfound freedoms, especially considering the still-multicultural nature of Istanbul at the time
It's now within borders of Turkey now but I would like to see the Empire of Trebizond
I have too many questions
1930s. A new modern republic, rapid increase in every aspect of rights and economy, great times, even just possibility to see Atatürk would worth it
I juts know my country's anthem and also know Azerbaijan's anthem little bit if it counts too
I'm pretty sure it would be *Arka Sokaklar*, a police/crime show
I don't have statistics but I remember watching it when I was in 2nd Grade, and its still running today
I had to google it
apparently its called Ferhunde Hanımlar(Ferhunde Ladies)
It has 1069 episodes according to google
it's been 587 episodes
started in 31 July 2006
Its actually “Ferhunde Hanımlar” with 1780 episodes
I'm from Istanbul, and my family is from a city close to it
So I can only understand accents that are close to the standard one, and the Aegean ones are fine too most of the time
Any accent from the middle, north, or east of the country stresses me out, I need to adjust for a few hours in those cities, in the worst cases I can only understand half of what they're saying
Special mention to the German Turks, theirs is the most confusing one for sure, I was just in the market today and it took me a minute to realize two guys there were actually speaking Turkish
Muğla, some deep parts of south east anatolia, some parts of east black see
But yeah, eagean dialects are sometimes too hard to understand
Same applies to Turkish Cypriots speaking Turkish
Cypriot Turkish is not hard to understand
It's just too cute :)
İt snows 2-3 times in Istanbul but then melts a day later
It used to snow way more back in the day , blame climate change I guess ...
It is seen mostly during teen and university years
People I know took them of when they were around late 20’s as they said it is time to grow up
Depending on your workplace but you can see people with piercings
Still if you have conservative employers, you wouldn’t hired anyways
Depends on the person and the place
It's typically negatively correlated with the level of conservativity
Just today, a young student made it to the internet news for getting fired due to his tattoos
They’re fine
Many of my friends have piercings on their faces, some of them are teachers, paramedic etc
Though I should add man may not be seen as presentable with face piercings
Depends on where you are,
In some places people would not mind,
Some other places the word atheist is an insult
Depends on where you live
Lurther east you go, more bigoted they are
Like you could get killed if you were to simply announce that you don't think god is real, or you don't believe in any religion
Further west, more open
It's almost linear with human development
I believe Izmir has the highest percentage of Atheists
I am an atheist myself
It is not pleasant at all, but they are 1st world problems
It's definetely not like SA or anything, but it is like one of the worst among 1st world countries
People can be very passive aggressive about it
They try to assert their religious culture into your life
If you were to ask that question to the average Turk, you would get "heretics" as an answer
Supporters of Erdogan like to stress that we are a 99% percent Muslim country (a terribly wrong and alienating estimate based solely on what is written on ID cards, which is Muslim by default unless your parents are of a different religion) while I'd say that a sizeable portion of the population is agnostic or deist in practice
Most people identify as Muslims but at most 50%-60% of them practise Islam beyond believing in a God and referring to it as Allah
So the reaction you get for telling that you are an atheist really depends on where you are
You either get a neutral reaction or hostile looks
However, the word "non-believer" is commonly used as an insult by politicians and many average people, although they usually use it unconscious of its implications, as in using ableist language in English (I don't think this is the case with the politicians who use the word though)
So there is a cultural bias against atheism
I personally face (especially from my family) reactions like tongue-clicking too
No one in my family has ever set foot in a mosque for decades, they are secular and okay with me being an atheist, but they still believe in God and think that I'll be punished (they don't want this to happen)
I rarely bring up the fact that I am an atheist because of this; I just nod my head in agreement or say ok when my mum wants me to pray for a certain thing
Laïcité is the best
Yes, West is much more accepting, but central and especially northern Turkey would be more aggresive towards atheists than the east but east is only slightly better
Turkey is urbanised in a toxic and random way so the urban population is too large and too diverse to form a base for any group
I would say that most people with university education are non-religious believers though, yes
That is a crime
I wish, i could write some jokes about Erdogan but i don't wanna find myself in prison at 3 in the morning
There, i said it
Erdogan, he is the tall man
Silivri is cold brother
Custom flair in homapeage of the subreddit
A masterpiece
Damn right
But it's the typical joke we say everyday like "Ohh man, that Erdoğan really pissess me off but i better shut up because prison must be damn cold right now
Just a number you say
Well, so is 911
I think Cyprus is an island so big that it feels like its on Mainland and there is no dispute about Cyprus not being on europe, Cyprus definitely is on Europe
I think OP meant overseas territories like Reunion, Falklands, French Guiana, Ceuta, Melilla etc

If it's just three then, Turkish, English, Indian
If it's three more: Italian, Arabic, Indian

İt's Avrupa     Asya     K. Amerika     G. Amerika     Antarktika     Afrika     and Avustralya or Okyanusya
Those two are used interchangeably
But Avustralya is used more because every continent name start and ends with an "a"
Same
Except we call Australia instead of Oceania
Father said: Whole family used to meet once in a month before my grandpa passed away
We don’t anymore
We all gather depending how close we are, we came early since we live 15 mins away like join the breakfast then talk about ourselves, news, education, life, etc
until we get hungry then women prepare the meal, youths carries it to bakery to be cooked in stone oven
Husbands usually don’t come unless it was weekend
Then usually we take care of garden as well clear some wild grass or clean and water the plants etc
When it is harvested, we get our share as well and this is how the day ends
Mother side: Since my mum lives around 900km away from them it doesn’t happen much often
When we visit Istanbul, it happens the next day
Same as close you are early you come
We talk about ourselves, news, education, life and politics
Politics usually ends up with bashing the history, facts and heat arguments ends nowhere
At the end we all get hungry which my grandma hates someone cooks for her so she would prepare the meal early in the morning
Then we return to talking without no politics
Then people go one by one depending how long it will take them to go back
\- Mustafa Kemal Atatürk
\- Fatih Sultan Mehmet (Mehmed II)
\- Kanuni Sultan Süleyman (Suleiman the Magnificent)
\- Abdulhamit II (Currently became really well known because of Erdogan's love for him)
There are a lot more but after these 4, I seriously doubt it can fulfill "everyone" requirement
- Mustafa Kemal Atatürk
- İsmet İnönü
- Mehmed I
- Suleiman I
- Selim I
- Enver Pasha (maybe
- Abdulhamid II
Mete Khan
Alparslan
Mehmed the Conquerer
Suleiman the Magnificent
Hürrem Sultan
Atatürk
İnönü
I am pretty sure a lot of people know Yavuz Sultan Selim (Selim I)
Mete Khan, İsmet İnönü, Sultan Alp Arslan
Just %15 of the populution have a fethish for incompetent Abdulhamit and you wrote him to your list but forgot these 3
I would add Architect Sinan to this list
I think people also know Osman (I), Nasreddin hoca, Yunus Emre, maybe  Barbaros Hayrettin
>Just %15 of the populution have a fethish
The OP ask for people who are well known not who are liked
>Mete Khan, İsmet İnönü, Sultan Alp Arslan
I believe these known less than Abdulhamit
And Piri Reis
Not known by everyone for sure
But fairly known
But as you said he is not known as Turkish
In fact I thought he was Arabic
>I believe these known less than Abdulhamit
Don't think so
It is just nonsense (I wish you guys use some suffixes, don't change the whole words) like other Euro languages (except Hungarian etc)
No connection with Turkish it is just zero, and also very hard to speak/think/build sentences (at least for me but I think for the other Turks the situation is same)
I like German more
Our language is better because Turkish is gender neutral
You don’t have to mess with She/He/It
Just say O.
I like it
I can express my feeling more clearly
It's very different from turkish which is an altaic language that's not part of the indo-european family
It's because of 2 reasons :
People admire Germans since last periods of Ottoman Empire
Almost everybody has a relative who went to Germany in 60s and 70s.
As a high schooler i am scared
I am not going to go to school for the first week and see what is going on, how the school acts for protecting us
Tho i am guessing the whole school thing will only last a couple of weeks because people are gonna get sick, no matter how many layers of mask they wear, teenagers are not going to give any fucks about distancing and gov probably will have to close schools again
In a speech in 2014, Erdogan stumbled and said "You can not preach my children about honestly earned food, although I have never had my children eat honestly earned food" to another party leader Kilicdaroglu
This was a few months after he was accused of supposedly hiding illegal income in shoe boxes

The Clock Tower, İzmir
Trenches, battle stations and canons from the battle of gallipoli
And yeah that horse statue from "troy" film
Odunpazarı Houses built by Locals also in sivrihisar district and armenian church, and Reşadiye Mosque in city center -Eskişehir Türkey
My hometown bolu has the tomb of hannibal barka
Istanbul - Hard to pick one but my answers would be Hagia Sophia, Galata Tower or Blue Mosque
İt is great that you have admiral in charge of a landlocked country
My turkic compainon we will always try to aid you
Çekiç (pronounced "chekich") Bad ass
I dont know
Different
yes
It's "çekiç" in Turkish they're must be related
It's "Çekiç" in turkish too
Yeah haha I think its pronounced the same
not that different apparently :D
Shocking is a bit too much, but I've personally had the chance to see German, Dutch and French people being surprised in different times over the large number of pubs in the city where I live
They weren't shocked, but they were pleasantly surprised
That here is not a desert
Same in Turkey in many households
Doesn’t everyone do that
I’m so confused
Doesn’t everyone put their toilet paper in the trash or is this just satire
We have here too and it's exactly like how you described
I spend more water and time in the shower trying to set the water temperature to something that doesn't freeze or burn my skin off than actually taking a shower
In Turkey, we learn English from first grade and we have spelling bee competition in usually 5th grade in some schools
Not a country where english is the primary language, but my school used to host spelling bee competitions between classes
I had my education in English completely (except history, geography, Turkish language and literature) so yeah definitely heard of it and participated in it
Simpler times
Same for Turkey too
I thought it was somewhat unique to Turkish seems like most european languages are the same
I wonder why english is so different then
Bold of you assume thah we elect our leader anymore
Yep
That's the exact system we have
But I've never seen Case 2 happen yet :D
It's because we *always* have one dominant political party at elections
For example it goes something like this:
A: 52%
B: 20%
C: 17%
D: 10%
E: 1% others
Not at all
Everyone is talking about school trips to different countries while I never went to a school trip except a Stupid Forest and our Capital
We don’t even go to school trips in my city
###Bruh Moment
Silence
We have mosques with full blast megaphones and they use them for every God damn things
You cannot sleep even 3 hours without interaption
I'll give two, one positive tradition and one negative
Positive: Visiting relatives during religious holidays(the eid and stuff)
Most people are starting to see it as an excuse to go on beach holidays, it seems
Negative: "Bride-taking". The tradition of "requesting" the bride from her father
I see the disappearance of this tradition as a net positive because this heavily objectifies women as the property of their fathers
In İstanbul, people usually drive very slowly in narrow roads, but it's not by choice
Firstly there's a lot of traffic even in small roads
Also, occasionally someone will double park so you will have to swirl around them, which slows you down
And lastly, the potholes/speed bumps would ruin your car unless you're driving an suv
Probably most associated song with us by foreigners is
[Üsküdar'a gider iken]
Which means "while I was going to Üsküdar (it is a district in İstanbul)"
[Wiki]
There are many covers of this song in the Balkans and Middle East
It is probably the most famous Turkish tune if you exclude "Misirlou".
Yeah, it is like Turkish food
We are used to it :D.
We have a city called Batman and batman doesnt even live there
We have a city called Batman
No Batman there as far as I know
Not really no
I've been working in advertising for almost 10 years now
Each year our deadlines get shorter and shorter
Even if I got my dream salary, my life wouldn't change that much because I have almost no time for anything else other than work
Kilis, typical Middle Eastern city
With arabic speaking populition and climate
Most Turkish city
I would say Ankara
Turkey is a really diverse country so my answer would be from the bias of someone raised by Mediterranean/Turcoman parents in Ankara
Out of all cities I've visited, Mardin or Urfa felt really foreign
I'm sure Mardin still has a Turkish *minority* which reinforces the feeling
They seemed out of Iraq or Syria
Artvin also had a different feeling to it, more like Georgia, which isn't surprising because it had been Georgian historically
Typically Turkish would be the inner parts of the Aegean region, IMO
But I feel more at home in Adana or Mersin or Antioch
İstanbul is Normal/Typical
Tunceli feels foreign because it is the only communist province
Hakkari Yüksekova is the most foreign feeling city
In Turkey, Izmir or Istanbul
Yes, these are most popular cities but there are 79 more cities and their cultures are so much different
At some of 79 other cities, for example you can be disgraced by people for having a girlfriend, but at western side it is more common
There are many examples like this
I went there last year for Erasmus and it was amazing
Of course
Teaming with Germany in WW1
Turkey is processing the same mistake right now
Let's wait, what time shows
Happy cakeday
A Turkish folk with more Mediterranean touch would be an excellent fit for İstanbul
Turkish folk is very unique because while it carries Turkic values, it also combines European and Asian styles
Which is the gist of İstanbul, really
For İstanbul, i am thinking of an anatolian rock song, both ethnic and rock at the same time, just like the city, in a perspective, it is overpopulated, dirty and dangerous, but if you live there you mostly dont mind those because you are a part of the city now and you know how to enjoy it
I shall give the love and care for stray animals
If loved and cared well, stray animals will be the spice of the city and they won't be a nuisance
I have seen a lot of pitbulls and bulldogs on reddit with smiles bigger than the happiest idiot in the world
I have seen nature's fiercest predators tamed and giving hugs to their owners who fed them from day one
I believe everyone starts as a blank page (looking at you, Locke) and treats the world the way world treats them
It's even easier to do so with animals
i lived in istanbul for a year and never passed to the european side

We have "Çorba" too
And lots of type of it
Is it similar to the Polish soup
Zurek (or however it is written)
Could be
And I was shocked when I heard you have "İşkembe Çorbası" and you call it "шкембе чорба" too
I know that
But "İşkembe Çorbası" hit me really hard
I guess one of the good examples for this is Romania and their involvement in holocaust
They murdered around 400k jews and roma
England, and Hungary
No, I hope it will stay that way
But our geographical regions are so diverse Economically, Politically and Culturally
In consideration that Russia and Britain is weak and Austria and Germans are doomed
Ottoman Empire would be present with a constuional monarchy and his balkan lands
Considering that all those jeunes turcs whomare present empire would be reformed
Cezzar Ahmet Paşa would be ready to defend Akka
Interesting how Döner had become the late night food in the non-mediterranean Europe
It's more of a lunch food for us
As for the question, It would be one of these: Kokoreç, mussels with rice, tantuni, islak (wet) hamburger
too bad we can't go outside after 9 pm but when this over i'll definitely go and eat some [kokorec]
) at night
unfortunately you guys can't have that in eu:(

It's not very common, just common enough that people don't find it strange
My country was always free
Some Turkish states on Anatolia didnt got raided bt mongols so we were free
Only moment we weren't free was 1920-1922 during Turkish Inpendenence War
Nazi
You were nazis
It wasn't free for a short time after World War 1, between 1919-1923
Istanbul was occupied by British forces and the treacherous Sultan was cooperating with them
Fortunately Atatürk liberated the country and declared that it shall be a republic
Although I would say that semi independent since inner anatolia was free and clashing with the invaders
You probably will be disappointed in every city you visit except Lisboa ehe
There are lots of hidden gems you wont be dissappointed
I can give more examples like; Strasbourg, Naples, San Sebastian, St
Moritz, Ljubljana, Antalya, Bodrum, Delfi and so on
I expected a normal city and found just that, but for what it is I do like it
It was a nice place to spend a few days in, I can't say I was disappointed
Same, They fucked it up but current major is doing great to fix it
What ancient cultures are teached in your country
For example, the Turkish education system mentions many states
Sumer
Babylonians
Akadians
Asyrians
Medians
Persians
Egyptians
Hittites
Greeks
Ionians
Phrygians
Urartu
Macedonia
Phonecia
Huns
Chinese
Indians
Xiognu
Rome
Carthage
Sythian
Lydians
Well, for some of them we just say some sentences and skip it
Like we don't talk about Carthage that much but we usually learn about them in some extent
For example we talk about Sumer and Hittites longer than Rome
Nice, we never talked about Mesoamericans, I think or I just don't remember
We maybe talked about the Maya but very briefly
"Do you know Dan Carlin’s history podcasts
No, are they good
When I think about it, we maybe never talked about the vikings
Our cultures rarely interacted
So, thats why but still a bit weird
I mean our thing is also short but it is like an half an semester at most
But we still learn about them multiple times
Oh really, we never went that deep
We knew some famous leaders and one or two wars but not much else in that regard
We are talking about them actually but very little
Especially before the Discover of America part
Yeah, our curriculum doesn't about America
Not evem the United States of America
Oh, interesting
I will look in to his podcasts
Yeah, fair enough
We only go in detail for Kadesh because thats the first ever written treaty
We don't care about the dates until we go in the middle ages
Of course, we do Middle ages and modern era too but these places are mentioned at least three times throughout the 12 years
A is /a/ as in father
H is /h/ as in hot
Turkish is that simple
I believe it's more like more like 'Hell' or 'Hello'.
Oof, you just made me remember how fucked up the situation is in Cyprus
Fuck the governments who don't want Cyprus to be free
Hey, handsome
Wanna help us topple him
That's true, but I don't think the Greek government would be willing to unite Cyprus unless it is done under the conditions they want, which would undermine equality for all Cypriots
I don't think governments represent the people, they just represent their own and allies' benefits
Germans don't owe us anything, the German government does
I am not against refugees either, and it is horrifying to see them treated like rats here
Even people who oppose to Erdogan are racist towards immigrants, and many are happy to see them go
But the Turkish government doesn't actually help them get to Europe, Erdogan just stated that they won't prevent them from going to the other side of the border
As a result, countless immigrants are trying to reach the other side on inadequate cheap boats, a family even tried to swim in the river that divides Turkey and Greece to reach there
They are left to die
They are also suffering near the border region at night, they only have their backpacks with them and don't know when they can cross the border
It is truly a disaster and it should be incredibly bad to be in their shoes since no one wants them
He made a fool of himself when he lost by a slight margin in Istanbul and forced a re-election
Funnily, the opposition won by a landslide the second time
It is true that he is losing power (his party started splitting up as well), but he is a skilled populist and is currently trying to collect support using nationalistic rhetoric and acts
His days are indeed numbered, but it will still take some years
Mm, yes
Riots in France really excite me
I would love to apply to universities there just to be able to live among people who can stand up for themselves if I knew French
Both
I believe the southern government is a puppet of Greece as much as the northern one is a puppet of Turkey
They disguised as progressives when they first came to power
They were always neo-liberal and started privatising everything, but they also fixed the crippled economy and improved life standards
Erdogan was quite in favour of Western values up until around 2011 - talks with the EU was going so good that many were hopeful we would be in the EU in a few years
They were religious and weren't hiding it (and were allied with the fundamentalist religious organisation which they had a conflict of interest with in 2013 and which was behind the coup attempt of 2016) but seemed to conduct it in a pro-liberty manner; for example, they removed the hijab ban in universities and state institutions
I believe they were still corrupt back then, slowly appointing their partisans to positions in official institutions, favouring them everywhere etc
but it wasn't significant enough to disturb the majority (it was actually liked by the religious rural population and urban lower working-class whose interests were often undermined by the secular governments of the past) and he had the support of businessmen who were pretty content because of the good state of the economy
Things started changing around 2011, when Erdogan started becoming more authoritarian with each passing day
2013 was one of the peaks, when people started resisting his increasing authoritarianism and desire to turn everywhere into a corporate playground
It is also the year in which Erdogan's party split up with the fundamentalists I mentioned; the group, being in control of the police forces, exposed their corruption and arrested many people from Erdogan's government
He survived nonetheless, initiated an aggressive breakdown of any opposition and was still going relatively strong
He used the coup attempt in 2016 as an excuse to exercise total control over the country and made the regime semi-presidential, granting himself immense privileges and power
He became significantly more conservative and nationalist in the past 5 years
The economy is now more fragile than ever because of Erdogan's stupid speeches
He practically controls the Central Bank and thinks his ideas on how to run an economy are more valid than actual economists' (he was originally an imam
), which frightens the investors
This is why most businessmen stopped being in favour of Erdogan, although Erdogan threatens them frequently to get what he wants
And there you go, the story of a man with an iron fist
His authoritarianism is only making him less popular these days, but he has no choice but to hold onto it if he wants to stay
He supports his image using nationalistic nonsense which even he was blatantly against only a few years prior and by trying to arouse a meaningless patriotic feeling in people
The immigrant situation is a part of this: he is the one who opened the borders to them in the first place, citing Muslim brotherhood and stuff, but now he wants to get rid of them because people dislike them - people whose votes are more important to him than ever
I prefer "rest in terror" lol
We would say "Teee anasının amında" (At (one's) mother's cunt)
Ours is much harder, begins with "Bir varmış bir yokmuş. Evvel zaman içinde kalbur zaman içinde, pireler berber iken, develer tellal iken, ben anamın beşiğini tıngır mıngır sallar iken
Yes we do, it's called "jandarma" and it sounds and functions exactly like gendarmarie as far as I can tell
They are the only military force not directly controlled by military high command
Instead they take their orders from the ministry of internal affairs, like the police
Straight outta canton
According to TDK (Turkish Language Association) we took the Italian word *"gendarme"* for jandarma but since French is a Romance language you can tell that it's the same word
Alors je l'ai appris aujourd'hui
Il y a plein de mots transparents je crois
Kahvaltı, means breakfast
Comes from Kahve Altı, which actually means before coffee
It is a tradition to drink Turkish coffee after meals, so it makes sense
It's all surface level
People who actually want to know about it do seperate studies
Simplifying ancient history and then getting progresively more detailed
We start from Stoneage and also learn Mesopotamian history
Ancient Anatolia, Greece, Egypt, India, China(tge last are the least detailed)
Old Turkic states, Islamic political history, Islamic Turkic States, Seljuks, Ottomans and the Republic of Turkey
We start high school at the age of 14
4 years high school and you finish thr high school like at the age of 18
High school should end when at age 17-19
I started university at age 17
I finished bachelor at 22
It supposed to last for 4 years but I made it longer by dropping final thesis twice
Now I am 24 and doing my master thesis
y'all still have conscription over there ?
In here you have to pay a hefty amount to dodge it
It makes sense for Norway since you guys are surrounded by our nato allies
Can you dodge it in there ?
Sorry I often confuse the EU with Nato
Nevertheless,they're surrounded by peaceful countries except for russia
You pay it to the government's account in bank but before you have to file a report
Even if you pay it off you still have to do it for 1 month but it's rather a vacation than actual soldiering
It was used to be 12 months but now it's 6 months and where you're stationed is completely random
Of course,you can put it off by joining university but I believe it's necessary in here since we border some interesting countries(Syria,Iraq,Iran,Armenia)
Does Russia care about Norway though ?
Even if they're not Nato I guess We'd help them anyway
My city has many names, the most recent being Istanbul
It derives from the Greek phrase "εις την Πόλιν" " [is timˈbolin], meaning "in the city" or "to the city", reinterpreted as a single word
And the Muslim population liked it because it sounds like Islam bol, which means "full of islam".
Ottomans also called it the sublime porte, in diplomatic documents
But mostly referred to it as Konstantiniyye, a turkified(or arabizied idk) version of Constantinople
While it was in very common use for centuries, the name was officially changed to Istanbul, in late 20s I think
My village's name was gevurdağ (foreigner mountain) which could also called as foreigner's mountain
Well it was an armenian village in the past so that explains a lot
Don't ask where the local armenians went i can't answer that im too young to go to jail
Artvin's etymology is quite unclear, it was firstly mentioned by Vakhushti of Kartli as "Artvani". Livane is the ancient name of the city also
~~I don't live there though~~
Sometimes in specialized materials such as history books/magazines etc
I have never seen anyone use it in daily speech
Grrrrrrrr
Or just rrrrrr
METU(Middle East Technical University)
Koç University
Istanbul Boğaziçi University, Istanbul Technical University, Middle East Technical University, Cerrahpaşa University in no particular order
My knowledge about universities isn't that good but these should all be good universities
Public: METU (Middle East Technical University), Boğaziçi Üniversitesi
Private: Koç Üniversitesi, Bilkent Üniversitesi, Sabancı Üniversitesi
u forgot Bogazici University
My dorm is literally next to the forest
I see foxes sometimes at night time, just passing through
Turkish dialects aren't so unintelligible that two people speaking in local accent would have (much) difficulty understanding each other
Besides, people from one region who move to another will not speak in their local dialect with people who may not understand it
For example I might pay no attention to my speech to my mom while shopping together but we will speak to the vendor differently
Old people usually just speak in their own accent though
I couldn't imagine asking anyone to speak "normal" Turkish, at most I might ask them to speak more slowly if they have a thick accent
Turkish is standardise on Istanbul Accent
However, talking with older generation, you can use dialect(accent)
or with friends, you can use daily dialect with shortcuts the words, etc
like
Gideceğim and Gitcem mean same but shorter on is used in daily talking
Probably depends on the person
My mother, who's from the northeastern Black Sea, normally speaks in the İstanbul accent but the moment she meets a person from her region she switches to the local accent
I think most older people soften their accents but don't completely switch
Usually there's a slight difference in tone you can hear
I guess it is easier for new generations as they're exposed to the Standard accent more often
Much more strict of in EU and future EU application
By this way there would be no difference between West and East
It's called Mantı(Mahnty), meat covered with dough, made by boiling, then adding yogurt, tomato sauce, pepper and all sorts of spices, and covering it all with butter at the end
It is a truly magnificent food, and I am lucky it originates from my home state, Kayseri
We have “mantı”.
It’s pretty much a dumpling but it’s mostly served with yoghurt and sauce on top
We have the same thing in turkey menemen with onions or without onions
Hmm, I do know this debate from somewhere
Turkey has that original debate for decades (probably centuries) now
**Menemen may be made with onions, but the addition of onions is often debated and is more common when menemen is eaten as a main dish, rather than at breakfast
Man I love Cyprus
My hometown is near to Cyprus close enough to see the silhouettes of the mountains
I've never been there but I want to spen my remaining life there
There's something magical in that Island across the sea     That I can't go     But I can see
For me it is Germany
I don’t know why
I guess old Turkish movies about Turks in Germany diaspora or my lovely old German neighbour who lives in Turkey for nearly 30 years maybe has effect on me
Because of EU laws NA engines are going to disappear tho

This is the song as far as i can remember
Erdoğan
The president
Unfortunately I wasn't able find one unanimously hated as whenever I typed something about an MP commiting a crime HDP MPs getting arrested came out and most of those cases are very controversial and imo are false charges
.... by very very far
Turkey in the past had hang politicians for corruption that doesn't even come close to the daily waste in his palace
Seriously, any second name that could come to mind would be far below his level
Hernan Cortes
Oh hell no, there are lots of idiots loving him, but no
He is literally a dictator
You can find erdogan lovers on the internet easily
They can’t talk proper English,they look like cows and most of them are 40+ years old
The new generation doesn’t like him,they are in the opposition side
That's what dictators are about
At least not enough to win the elections countrywide
At least some people are starting to realize that this guy is using their religion to fuck up the country
I hope that the young generations will change this
Tho if you go to eastern sides of Turkey, people still love him so much
Currently between 20-30% or maybe less
He fucked up the last election and everyone saw it
Now he tries to gain support with a war so he can call for a snap election before the opposition unites under a strong opponent
The way it seems, he wouldn't mind starting a war or pulling off another fake coup and killing more people to stay in power until he dies
An article on wikipedia said that 2016 coup was a self-coup(is this the correct thing to say
) made by Erdoğan
Sınce then we cant use wikipedia here
I use vpn to do research
That is just so selfish
People voting for erdoğan from way over there
1 euro equals to fucking 6 tl here
We are literally poor
And these guys are just saying that he is good, its not that bad etc
Just irritating
They are the hypocrites
They are rich enough to live in Europe but they’d still say erdogan is a world leader
When I say them “Why are you living abroad if he is so good” or asked to “Come back,look our economy is rock-solid” they tend to say “I got my work going here” But we,who can’t move to europe, are stuck sith this idiotic bastards who can’t seem to understand the situation we are in
It is a really fucked up chain of events
I am trying to graduate from college then I’ll live somewhere else where I can be free and live a like normal human being without surrended by morons
A branch of my family lives in Sweden and they are just normal people who hate him more than anything
He's the reason why the more elderly of them can't seriously consider moving back to Turkey, because everything, absolutely everything is between his two lips and extremely unreliable
My point is that it is easier to support a dictator when you are not being directly effected
On the positive side, it looks like we exported disproportionately large amount of dickheads to Europe
I tried to stop that by protesting against it by people who live abroad abd vote for him are seen as hypocrites by opposition side
On the other hand,erdogan lovers love them because they think gastarbeiters represent the Turks out here and they tend to believe everyhting gastarbeiters say
(Europe is collapsed,their money is worthless,no etcihal values,etc
)Believe me when I say the opposition hates the filthy animals who lives abroad and supports erdogan
edit:spelling
The point i am proving is that you cant just talk shit about him like that, if you do, bye
There are dozens of journalists in prison just for talking shit about erdoğan
We are getting similar with north korea, step by step
No, on the contrary, Istanbul had much less of the conservative types when all Europe seemed to have them
It was perhaps because they came from rural parts where they didn't have as many options as in Istanbul and they went to Europe mostly as manual labourers with no education
Now it has changed and there're also a lot of brains migrating
Oh, great
Can't wait to have Erdogan get mentioned a thousand times on this thread
sorry for having a dumbass as a president
Our thin skinned buffoon has been around for longer
45 percent of the country is really retarded though, you can break everything down to its basics and they will still probably say something like "you don't get this yet, you need to grow up
or "It was much worse back in the day, they fixed it and made roads
Azerbaijani is very easy to understand for Turks also Crimean and Gagauz Turkish is understandable as well
One fun fact I've learned recently: "I am lost" in Azeri Turkish means "I am horny" in Anatolian Turkish
So many false friends
The Uyghur language is related to the Turkish language to the extent that you can hold an extremely slow, basic conversation; but it is also not similar enough
I would say they are as similar as German and Swedish to each other
Maybe a bit further than that
There is one Uyghur song that I understand 80%, but daily speech is hard to understand
Written speech is easier to decipher if you make the effort
We also read ancient Turkish literature in high school which is more similar to the modern Uyghur language
All Turkic languages have some similarity to each other
Turkish and Azerbaijan Turkish are very very similar
There is a joke that a Turk who visits Baku will land not knowing Azeri and become fluent in one week
For me, the similarities to Turkish are in this order: Turkish > Azerbaijan Turkish > Gagauz Turkish > Turkmen (Turkmenistan) > Uyghur, Uzbek > Kazakh, Krgyz > Yakut
As I said, some of these could be as far as Swiss German and Icelandic
I know
It is a total mindfuck that people all the way in Western China speak a language related to mine
Also, another mind-blowing fact is the Uyghur language is more similar to ours than Kazakh and Krgyz are, despite being farther from Turkey geographically
I would say this has happened to dialects of Turkish within Turkey as well
The dialects got diluted
Basically nobody speaks the original dialects of their regions anymore
It's sad :(
No idea why
It could be because Uzbek (Karluk branch, same as Uyghur) borders Turkmen (Oghuz branch, same as Turkish and Azeri)

I guess the autonomous territorial unit of Gagauzia is also to claim independence in the case that Moldova's sovereign status change
Not sure about that one though, need confirmation
suprisingly homicide rate in İstanbul very low but femicide is high so your choice
(i explained İstanbul cuz my city is too small to explain)
Depends on which part of the city we are talking about
The slums like Gaziosmanpaşa? Wouldnt want to walk there at night with 30 people protecting me
Richer areas like Levent
I would walk alone without a care in the world
Edit: The City's Istanbul btw
i live in antalya
i feel extremely safe when i walk at night but i am a dude, so
I am living in Istanbul and Makkah(mainly Istanbul), at Istanbul everywhere is not walkable at night just some areas
But at Makkah, there are cops everywhere and no one is messing with you
It's okay for a city of 16 mil
My immediate surroundings are very safe
If you avoid bad neighborhoods you should be fine
Town of 10k. Mostly consist of old or working people so very safe
Might watch out for territorial dogs
It isn't walkable at night, because there is a 2100-0500 curfew due to COVID
Jokes aside, it really depends on where you are
In Tunalı Hilmi
You'd be lucky not to get stabbed by a druggie
In Çinçin
Hell, it's not walkable *at daytime*. In Yenimahalle
Perfectly safe
Although this is from the perspective of a male, I can't speak for non-trans women
I don't think anywhere in Turkey would be very safe for lone women at night, although Ankara is safer than Istanbul in that regard
Edit: Just realized most here have no idea what a Yenimahalle or Tunalı Hilmi or any other district of Ankara is, my bad
Most Turkish historians claim ottomans still would collapse since they didn't reformed theirselves tho

Woah you can buy a whole city with that much money :D our economy is pretty shitty

Usually First 3 is the most popular as pizza sauce but hot sauce is the most popular in my city
Other usually used for french fries or nuggets
Also we have mixed spices for sauce as well which is usually enough
Other than mixed spies you have to pay for each sauce
Finally some restaurant might have different sauce which can be ordered with pizza

Ow, my lovely country Cyprus
I mean the Northern Cyprus
I will live my life after 35 in one of the bays of our country
No I am from Turkey
Whats matter
Yep I said
Because its kinda my second country, do not need visa or passport
And also I love culture of turks and greek
So its a heaven for me :p
"I vow to thee, my country
", Russian military songs, "Viva la quinta brigada" (Spanish revolutionary song), German anthem is so cool also
I know Grave Digger isn't Scottish or Sabaton is Polish but Rebellion and Winged Hussars both are very good songs if they count
Also I think Polyska is patriotic song i also like it very much
I like Merck toch hoe sterck as well, but my favorite has to be My Country, 'Tis of Thee
>The Ottoman Mecidiye Marşı
I see you are a man of culture as well
Yes, yes Ay Carmela
The song starts with the line "Viva la quinta brigada".
I feel like Asian and European in the same time
(I live in East Thrace)
Probably thats the thing what makes us Turkish I guess
Neither but I'm from western part of the country and from what I've gathered it seems like Greece is culturally the closest country even more so than Azerbaijan so if I had to choose, I'd say European
Turkey is a special case
I don't live in Turkey but as a Turk I feel the need to explain us
**Turks are European (Balkan), Asian (Turkic), Anatolian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern (Persian) and Mediterranean
We are not one single thing, we are the embodiment of all of these things mixed together
You just can't classify us as one single entity
So one doesn't feel more European or Asian, one feels everything together
To give you an idea, Turkey borders 7 countries with [7 different alphabets] (if you count Persian and Azerbaijani as different)
So, we are a melting point
Almost whole Europe uses the Latin alphabet, like Turkey, and most of countries doesn't have a neighbour with a different alphabet in Europe, yet we have 7 countries with 7 different
We share similar vibes like Spanish, French, Italian, Egyptian, Greek etc
people as a Mediterranean country which makes us feel close to them compared to North European countries
And we ruled Balkans for so long that we basically share a very similar culture and feel East-European (or they feel like us to be more precise)
That is our European part
On the other hand Anatolia has a unique culture
It was a homeland for many civilizations even before the Greeks and Persians ruled there
Till this day the inner-Anatolia feels different than the other parts of Turkey for a reason
That unique culture lingers on
On the other side we have the Middle Eastern influence through the Persians and the Islam
Persians influenced Turkish and Turkic culture very much, probably the main influence till this day (Turks influenced anyone else they came in contact with except for Persians who influenced Turks)
And Persians are very different to Arabs, don't mix it up
And we ruled Arab lands (Levantine) for also a long time, so there is that
And finally the "umbrella" of everything, Turkic and minorily Caucasian roots
We came from Central Asia and brought that culture with us to Anatolia and mixed there with everyone around us but that stayed our main identity
So we share all of these things, I feel like all of them together
When I talk to an Uzbek, I feel as close as I talk to a Bosnian
I don't feel super close to them, but I feel a nice connection
I see an Italian basically as a christinified Turk as we have very similar cultures except for a different religion
How they treat their families, talk and act warmly that is very close to us (Northern Europeans are cold when it comes to social interactions)
I also see myself as Middle Eastern due to various reasons
The closest answer you will get is this: I feel "Turkish" more than anything else
PS: Most of European languages are classfied as Indo-European
So they share the same root and are branches of that family
Yet Turkish does not belong to that tree, it has its own tree and family
Even though we are neighbors to Indo-European cultures, neighbor to Semitic countries or to Slavic people or once to Chinese people, Turkic languages are on its own and share no roots with anything else
So, that is probably the main reason we see ourselves as "Turkish", it is its own thing as I tried to explain
We harbor all of these mentioned cultures in us under the umbrella of being Turkish
I have always felt European because I have big sympathy for European values
Also I have lived my entire life in Thrace so, more asian than European
Plus, as one of the commenters pointed out, there is no asian identity like there is for European
I feel european, I hate many turkish traditions and don't like my country except Istanbul, I wish could born in eu
I feel europan because I've born and raised in Europe and my family are from balkans
We wuz khanz
There is a quote by Atatürk about the ANZACS which i find very nice: "Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives
you are now lying in the soil of a friendly country
Therefore rest in peace
There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours
You the mothers who sent their sons from far away countries wipe away your tears
Your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace
After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well"
Turkey feels like the center of the world for a reason
It is between Africa, Europe and Asia
I (or we) hope
Since when was Turkey = Erdo
Immigrants are worst Turks I have ever seen, they live in developed countries and 50-60 percent of them are telling "Here is so bad, we miss our home" and they support erdogan
In turkey, people except erdoganists usually support Ataturk
1999 earthquake
One of the most traumatic events of our recent history
The magnitude was 7
5 and tens of thousands of people died or injured
So many building collapsed and trapped the victims that night
There are documentaries of the incident if your stomach can handle
One of the most striking ones for me was a little girl, screaming for help under the ruins
She was later rescued but her family members were still trapped and unresponsive
She was crying “Mom, mom” constantly
It was heartbreaking
Edit: [link]
Probably the '99 earthquakes in İzmit and Düzce that collectively killed about 45
000 people and left more than 250
000 people homeless
There was an episode of The Crown covering Aberfan Disaster
I was shocked while watching it and even more shocked researching it later
One of the most horrible tragedies of the modern times, in my opinion
Apple tea
It's a marketing wonder
Someone managed to put it into the German tourist market and it became the very Turkish thing to have, to bring back home etc
Honestly it doesn't exist in Turkey anywhere other than foreign tourist areas and is not consumed by Turkish people
Sounds like it became a more common thing here in Turkey to have 5 afternoon tea though the whole tea drinking habit came from the British
If the palm of your hand is itchy, you'll get money from somewhere
If an owl lands on a house, a dead will come out of it
If you pour water (on the ground
Literally) after someone travels somewhere, they'll come back faster
Cutting down a fig tree will bring bad luck
Buildings are too close to each other, and walls are almost always thin
It's very hard to find a peaceful silence in big city life
Even at nights
What do you mean by nature
I am just curious because
I thought the Amsterdam Forest and Veluwezoom National Reserve was amazing
I have been to both of them and I thought they were super enjoyable and well preserved
Also Dunes of Texel National park was simply magical
I did not expect it to be look so out of tbis planet
Had such fun time there
And one time we flew to Bergen from Amsterdam with my friends to see the fjords and I think you are so lucky to be so close to Norway and not have the limited daylight and very cold weather (colder than Amsterdam at least) so you can just visit and come back home without having to survive  the cold and dark times of Nordic countries
Never been to Sweden but my friend lives there and wants to move to Netherlands or Germany and visit Sweden in summers only
I am from Turkey so going to those places means 4+ hours of flight and that is why I am jealous and I think I would prefer to live in Netherlands and take camping trips to Sweden
Hmm I get it now
How about Germany
Does it have good nature
Not for a day but like a weekend of hiking
I have always visited big cities in Germany so I have no idea
Istanbul
without a doubt
I can’t decide if Aegean or Mediterranean Region is the best
People who live in big cities where temperatures regularly drop to -20° celcius or lower, how is life then
I especially wonder about Moskvichs
How do you dress to go outside, to work etc
Does everything run normally while it happens
Do cars(especially diesels) struggle to start up
What happens to homeless
Do cargo companies or food delivery work
I only saw such low temperatures(lowest I saw was -17°) in snowboarding trips, and despite dressing like an astronaut(thermal underwear, ski pants, two layers of coat) I felt very cold and looking at my phone was impossible, because my hands stopped being able to move ~30 seconds after removing my gloves
I know places like Yakutsk where -40° is common, but those places usually have very local economies and smaller populations, I ask this question specifically for international metropolitan cities where there's a lot of "stuff" and transportation going on
I live in İstanbul so I never experienced extreme cold like that here, even though sometimes there's thick snowcover here, it's very rarely colder than -5°.
Can you remove your gloves to use the phone though
Even trying to use the skipass was a major pain in the ass for me at -17°, my hands lost any feeling pretty quickly
I work as a developer in Japan too, and I have to write it in English with Japanese mixed for obvious reasons
^(-Japanese are bad at English-)
Comments are full Japanese, variables and other stuff are mixed
I used to be a bit idealist about it and tried to go full English, but then again when you are surrounded by straight out of 4-year university with no IT skill Sato-kuns, you succumb to atrocities like *isKaishi,* *GenchakuCheck(), cdRoll* ^((not "role" sadly))*.*
I believe I can say it started after late 80’s generation to hang out with opposite gender as you described
But Erdogan’s forced Islam changed this a lot
Many of the girls who wear hijab can’t even tell their family to they will meet with a boy
This saddens me that how much we’ve come changed to different direction
Otherwise it is normal to meet people with opposite gender
We say just "Alo" at Turkey and after that we are directly speaking about topic
*alo* or *efendim*.
*aalööööö* is also another variant which tells a lot about the person at the other end of the line :)
We say "alo" too when we answer the phone
Republic of Turkey is founded in 1923
Although if you trace back states on a timeline; Ottoman Empire is founded in 1299, Anatolian Seljuks is in 1077 and Seljuk Empire is in 1037
The Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923 with the declaration of the Republic
If you wanna date back even more Great Hun Empire (204 BC - 216 AD) is known as the first Turkish empire
TBH Huns are considered as a tribal confederacy rather than a Turkish state
They were Turkic, not solely Turkish
Also I don't like stretching the country's history so far into Huns
Yes Huns and Göktürks are our past history but our states is more related with Ottomans and Seljuks
In my opinion, taking Seljuks as a starting point is more appropriate
That's already happening, people who buy property for more than $250,000 automatically receive citizenship, and since wealthy Arabs love buying houses in Turkey it leads to some neighborhoods in Istanbul and many places in Black Sea region to look like Saudi Arabia - nobody speaks Turkish, even shop signs and whatnot are all in Arabic
People with absolutely no knowledge of Turkish that hve nothing to do with this country just randomly get Turkish passports and it pisses me off, as far as I'm concerned language knowledge should be the #1 requirement for citizenship
If I were to move to another country I wouldn't even consider any place that I don't know the language of
Well many locals also can’t speak the language properly so, they would fit in
Now this is my topic
And even ours is worse
Syrians are coming to Turkey without learning our language
But they learn Turkish by being in Turkish people
We cannot even tax their shops because they have no ID
Some of these refugees go to their own country in holidays
And the government is helping them worth of billioms of dollars while its own citizens try to end a month with a minimum wage of $350
And government is giving them citizenship
Thoughts
> ugh, i thought only some tax haven carraibean islands do that :/ that's not how it should work
Foreign investment is good for currently struggling Turkish economy, plus the property developers are obviously lining up the pockets of our political leadership with cash, so they're happy to sell our country for $250k a piece
Damn shame
> That's a bit tough statement
Don't you think it's fine if they come knowing only basics, as long as they're ready to learn
I'm a very social and talkative person, so the language barrier is a big no-no for me
For instance I grew up in Russia and returned to Turkey in my teens, I know Turkish and don't have an accent but I'm not as articulate with Turkish language as people who grew up here and obviously my vocabulary isn't as rich as it is in Russian cause I didn't receive Turkish education or read as many books in Turkish as I did in Russian language
This alone kills me and gets in the way of socializing for me the way I did back in Moscow, if even having lesser vocabulary than locals is frustrating I can't even imagine moving to another country where I don't speak language at all
The issue I take with Arabs is lack of integration or desire to learn the local language, an average Arab in Turkey only hangs out with other Arabs, doesn't know Turkish much, only shops at Arabic shops and buys his meat at Arab butchers, goes to Arabic barbers and Arabic restaurants, etc, which results in neighborhoods and cities with big migrant Arab populations slowly transforming into full-blown Arab territories with women in burkas and men with bushy beards, long white dresses and sandals all over the place, Arabic shop signs and ads on every corner, people speaking Arabic everywhere
It pisses off locals and ramps up the fears of Arabization and Islamization of Turkey, plus ruins the perception of Turkey for other foreigners who visit and see that stuff and might assume these people are Turkish and this is what Turkey normally looks like
-once a week check out the bowls of neighbourhood cats, if empty fill with food (anything edible, those bastards don’t pick food)
-leave the apartment door open so animals can get warm inside during winter
-If it’s a religious day people share food with each other in an apartment
sometimes in turns sometimes all together
-local market, butcher, tailor etc knows everyone in the neighbourhood
You can enjoy a cup of tea any time during the day
-Everyone knows everyone this has advantages and disadvantages
People get together to help you when you re down but you don’t have much privacy
The old babushkas will know about your love life more than you
Being good, sociable and helpful neighbours is very important around here
But I personally hate this notion since it usually results in people gossipping about you and being too curious about what you do, who you're with and etc
So all I do is to say good morning/evening/night when I see them
Other than that, I don't know their names
It is common for our family to know our neighbours
My mum knows 6-7 neighbours in our apartment which helped us or we helped them since we moved in
For example, our next door neighbour lost their just in same week but since we were close to them they told us and we helped them to find a job
And our neighbour in 6th floor helped to pass chemistry test by giving me free private lesson in 4 in the morning
At least for us having good relationship with neighbours helps a lot even if you won’t expected it
Even if there is proverb for it “Don’t buy a house, obtain(gain) a neighbour” “Ev alma, komşu al”
Your comment made me laugh and also made me relieved that I am not alone lol
I even missed the bus a couple of times because of waiting inside
Cat
I am student that studies politics in Ankara it s really easy yo get to the university it only takes 5minutes
İ Am highschool student this is my school way
10 minute walk
8 minute metro (İstanbul)
10 minute walk
total 28 minute
Attila (hungarian) i love this name because atilla is same name in hungarian and turkish
Nikos
I would like to be called Nikos
Sounds like name for pizza tbh
gangster wolfs .street culture
Moving out is only socially accepted when you get married or your parents are not old and can take care of themselves both physically and economically
You are expected to stay home and help with house income
Even if you move out you re still pressured to keep in touch with your family on bidaily basis at least
Family comes first before individualism
Exactly the same here in Turkey
But traditions play a role as well as economical conditions
Things hard to accept but still truth, oof
unfortunately most turk people only know my good boy vlad the impaler and nothing else about romania
My name basically is street name in Poland
[Kantaka]
We don't have camels and don't like Arabic Culture that much in Turkey
It's like a combination of East's and West's culture
And a little Mediterranean culture
Most of population is muslim
But much more secular than other East/Muslim Countries
Our people are warm, hospitable and love teaching culture to tourists
It has a very rich food culture as well
As geographical and historical you can find a lot to visit
I am watching it for the first time
I was in Vienna these days last year, it is nice to see the city again even if it is on the TV :)
Same
I really love it
Turkey has the world's highest density of archaeological sites per area, world's oldest temple in Göbeklitepe (though an older one has recently been found nearby) and 2 of the 7 wonders of the ancient world
To make up for all this pre-Turkish achievements, modern Turkey has more skyscrapers than all Europe combined except Russia
I can tell lots of fun facts if you are interested in dark humor
In rural Anatolia, throwing and breaking eggs on the head/body of the groom at the wedding night is a tradition
I have no idea about the origins of the tradition
A similar thing exists within conscription traditions
The first day that you have less than 100 days to finish your service, people throw things at you, eggs or whatever they have until you become a walking mess
In return, you offer them food and drinks to celebrate
Yes, indeed
In Turkey, those lowlife leaders still think they are a good thing that makes Turkey a civilised country
Nobody asks the people anyway
I don't know Istanbul but the country has 89 operative and 46 under  construction buildings over 150 meters
I counted 52 on this page:
Definitely sütlaç. It's basically a rice pudding made with milk
Mostly consumed by the workers/peasants
Ottoman Empire was a Turkish empire
Wrong it was an empire of one very mixed family, turks were nothing but one of  their many subjects and usually the most ignored one
There are thousands of pre ottoman relics from older Turkic empires all around Anatolia but you can hardly find an ottoman investment other than one or two big buildings
Turks originate from middle east
We are part of the middle east
He means we are not originally from middle east
We are from Asia/Siberia
We lived there for thousand year and came to anatolia in 1071 with Malazgirt war
Ottoman Empire,we only learned just good sides of Ottoman Empire
It was a powerful empire in 15th,16th and 17th centuries,it conquered lots of lands and ruled these lands with justice
In my opinion all empires in the world weren't good or weren't bad
They ruled theirown lands and one day they felt
Wıth good rulers, Ottoman was cool and just but with time and the effect of Islam, we fucked up bad
We learned about all it's rulers in history, and the Siege of Constantinople and stuff, then we learned about The Ottoman Empire in WW1
Thank to Kara Mustafa Paşa for that : )
Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Yokohama, Hiroshima, Nagasaki
Not sure if these are cities:
Okinawa, Hokkaido, Shibuya
Erdoğan by far
Even a majority of his voters don’t really support him
He’s done more harm to the country than any other
He’s undermined the secular and modern views of Atatürk
He’s set the country waaay back
All our neighbours hate us
Economy has been going downhill for years
The unemployment rates are skyrocketed
Tax money is being spent on useless shit nobody ever uses just so he can claim we’re progressing
We are not
Constructing roads isn’t progress
You’d think a party known for their roads would know how to make a decent one
They can’t even deliver that right
Corruption EVERYWHERE
We make politicians and selected few richer while we’re getting poorer day by day
Left has always seen his bullshit
The main nationalist right wing party (MHP) used to oppose AKP but they’re supporting them now which is costing them voters
Some of AKP voters aren’t so happy about the party but they think it’s the “lesser evil”. The die hard fans, I have no words for
I can’t wait for that scum bag to be yeeted out of the politics
For some Erdogan, for some Kılıçdaroğlu, for some Babacan
But everyone hates Perinçek, who, for some reason, is considered nationally relevant despite getting 0
22% of the vote
I think he has switched ideologies a total of five times
How many votes does DENK get
Is it something fully Turkish
Sounds familiar
Sorry my English is not good, did you use 'occupy' as a bad meaning
And I guess "2e kamer" is the name of the Dutch Parliament
In the districts with immigrant density, I believe
Ah, in Turkish we use it for someone who doesn't deserves to be there
For example opposition leaders are oftenly say that Erdoğan occupies the Presidential seat
Thanks for the explanation, I know Dutch politics better now :)
i know some people who do it on pans, but i prefer using a machine where it presses the breads into each other and they get crispier easier
we callt hem tost
Its called "tost" here in Turkey, it has lots of different versions, but the one you can find everywhere is with kaşar(some kind of cheese) and sucuk(some kind of dried meat)
Hosting millions of refugees so they don't ruin your precious countries
Can't say I agree with how erdo's doing stuff
But its just politics I guess
A better example of not nice would be sinking refugee boats and leaving them to die I think
Greece seems to be doing it with no repercussions
The Last Sultan of Ottoman Empire
Boyfriend killed his girlfriend(ex
) and shared on instagram as it is finished with date and time
Admitting to killing her
This type of male violence against woman has upraised under current government which they don’t so shit about it
Other than citizen, celebrities are doing ads or public speeches to educate people and woman who is under abusive relationship to survive if there will be an attack like this
Mass suicides
4 family member killed themselves with cyanide because of living difficulties due to too many debt which made them nearly impossible to survive without any help
Same as a father did this to his family
Killing the mother, kid(s?) and himself with cyanide
Erdoğan’s university diploma
Somebody sued him for not having any university diploma or diploma which given under education which is less 4 year and this means he is illegally president of Turkey since 2014 (not 2002)
I think current situation is now in EHRC
Any citizen with connection to government is spending our taxes as in their private life
Imagine person who worked for around 1,500€ 3 years ago won 500,000€ bid to use as commercial of 2 most iconic and historic building in Istanbul
Other part is that Istanbul Major(opposite of Erdogan) which biggest city by economics did go in as well but didn’t called in for bid
This is against the law and now they are suing this bid
A father wanted to investigate his daughters murder
They said it was suicide but Criminal Lab and other scientific departments said this can be suicide by evidence
Now case’s statue changed to murder
I don’t which side what defence is doing but they wanted to father into mental hospital due to his daughter’s death
He just wants justice to person who did this to his daughter
Edit: Changed the years in Erdogan
Our economy
Yes, Black Sea Region
They use fish as like salt
It is everywhere
>>not knowing some words
Is there also a standard form of Hungarian that is free from dialects, like Hochdeutsch or Istanbul Turkish
If yes, do people use that form while interacting with people from other regions
Oh thanks a lot for the explanation really
Here the standard is Istanbul Turkish, and it's also more or less the written form
But some suffixes are shortened in all dialects (e.g. the future tense suffix) so those are always different in written Turkish
The differences are mainly based on accent and intonation in addition to the pronunciation of suffixes in general
Regional differences also exist among some words, which are typically influenced by the neighbour languages or archaic words
In general, you can identify the region one comes from quite accurately judging by the accent and the words used, if any
But the more educated one is, the more likely s/he is to speak the standard form, or at least try to do so
Having a strong accent is typically tried to be avoided as it is perceived a bit too rural in general
Before 2018, General Staff of Turkish Republic was the highest branch of the army and didin't connected to Ministry of Defence, after 2018 it attached to Ministry of Defence and rhe ministry become the highest branch
I'm not a muslim
i hate tea and baklava
I don't drink tea
How do you do, fellow Kafir
More than %90 of the Turks in Turkey are muslim
At least thats what they say
They do, people still think Turkey is an islamic country and cant handle the thruth that people can be non-muslim
Of course i am not talking about every single person in Turkey but they are a  large majority, simply the same people who voted for Erdoğan for years
To my friends, yes
To my family, no
They can be very fanatic about islam, so it is better that way since we consider the fact that i am still living with them
I’m so French to that subject
— that means I know nothing about it
"Being French to a subject" means having no idea/info about that subject
But I don't know the origin of the saying
Being 'French' to something, meaning not knowing anything about the subject
This may sound weird but youtube channel Kraut which is an Austrian youtube channel made a  [3 part serie for history of Turkey in English (I linked the first video)] This semi documentary starts from Central Asian Turks to Erdoğan
I would recommand it
3 episodes and 4 hours
It's really a great documentary
I'd also like to recommend Kraut on YouTube not only for his Turkish Series which were truly brilliant, but also for his other stuff as well
Turkish oil wrestling - a local traditional national sport that has been around for centuries
Men wear nothing but tight leather shorts (!), rub tons of oil on each other - you're supposed to rub oil on your opponent and he's supposed to rub it on you as a sign of mutual respect (!!), then these hairy, oily, shiny, muscular half-naked guys wrestle in front of the public and the whole point is to put your hands inside of your opponent's shorts as deep as possible (!!!), and if you defeat an older wrestler you then kiss his hand (!!!!)
And yes, it looks as homoerotic as it sounds
Can't make this shit up
EDIT: here's a video for you guys -
When you come to visit your significant other’s family to ask their permission to marry, your SO makes coffee to serve
If it is salty, it means she doesn’t want to marry to you
If it is sweet or way to sweet, she definitely wants to marry you and you drink all of it to show you really want this marriage
But now, uneducated people changed this into only salt coffee and you have to drink it all to show your intention to this marriage as well as to show how rough a guy you are
Some people made it worst that they put, eggs and other stuff into to coffee to make it harder challenge which ended up killing the their future husband
My grandparents does the same
We even have soup version of this and I always wonder why
I don’t know if they air this on Christmas time in Turkey, too but they definitely air Looney Tunes and Disney dubbed cartoons in the morning and Home Alone during the day and finish up with some good films at the end during first day of the year
It is, lol
Somebody needs to capitalize on this and organize trips to oil wrestling tournaments for gay tourist groups
Hell, I'm sure some might want to participate as well and not just watch
> Turkey
you have some explaining to do
Fun fact: Homosexuality got decriminalized in the Ottoman Empire in 1858
Decades earlier than most other countries
Which may or may not be connected to this wrestling
Enver Pasha was really not a cool dude
For Turkey or formerly Ottoman Empire, the dumbest 2 things were:
1st while controlling the seas (the Mediterranean) granting nations to use the seas in exchange for money
We didn't realize the power of it until it was too late
While we had the power for more than hundreds of years, we could have controlled all European countries + would have our own access to South America, Africa and Asia
We gave that away basically for peanuts
2nd dumbest thing was to push forward to the West a.k.a underestimating the Russians
The Russians were settled in a tiny village when we were across 3 continents
Underestimating them and giving them space and letting them evolve freely in our steppes was a big mistake
Instead of pushing to Vienna, we should have pushed for North (above Crimea) and seal the deal with the Cental Asian steppes where already Turkic people lived for centuries
The reason why the Ottomans fell apart was the Russians
We got our asses kicked a lot by them because our focus was in the West
caring religion too fucking much and ignoring science developments
Don't forget the time when the Sultan (Osman II) was overthrown and tortured (and allegedly raped) to death for wanting to do army reforms
Liechtenstein ’s is pretty unique, I don’t see any competition here
Winner is clear
Luxemburg and Netherlands because of their color
I just like yellow lisance plates
Iconic design of the classic UK plates are also amazing, but their plastic material looks quite unsatisfying
Also, their europanized lisance plates looks horrible
I also like tiny versions of the Italian, Finnish and Swedish lisance plates
We learn and write it without a line
Z with the line is very rare
Maybe, it was more frequent in many decades before
Honestly, I've seen both
I write it without a line though
Mostly without a line but i saw lot of people write with line
About 30% of the people use 2 or more names
Most of the time, one of it is one of your dads parent's name and other one is the name that your mom wants
Those names are used like 2 main names rather than a main and middle name
Me and most of my friends uses one name with his relatives and other name for friends or other people
Generally, your family uses the ancestral name and friends use the shorter one if there is no one with same your name
But it depends of course

Basically this girl with a Kangal:
Maybe throw in a Turkish cat and she lives in the maiden's tower
Tomyris could be a nice representation of Turkish women
But i can't imagine it as a child movie lmao
>What do they look like
Thanks to our ancestors, we have no idea
Lmao
Just put some random central asian women on the role and we will be ok
Eheheeh
>Do they have an animal sidekick
Her horse of course
She was a shaman
>Magical powers
She was a ruler of a civilitation where women had a voice and treated respectful and almost equally with men
And it was 2000+ years ago
Isn't that magical enough
Edit: Google says that she was the first woman ruler
Soo, that's also sound magical
They sacrifice themselves for Soviet Russia
[Göbekli Tepe] [Hagia Sophia] [Sultan Ahmet Mosque(Blue Mosque)] - Each building has a unique style and a history
[Dolmabalçe Palace] - Personal favourite for single building
Designed for The Empire and become new heart of the city
[Old Istanbul] - I love visiting these areas in Istanbul because they are full of history and lives
Different people like Turks, Greeks, Armenians, French, English and many more people lived in these areas with their mark standing still to date
These people created a culture which can’t be seen in today’s life but if you look for it, you will find these people in the city
Taxi drivers hands down
Police officers, sure
I am not sure if it is hate but there is a huge distrust towards the judges and prosecutors
> This system isn't exactly popular
Irrelevant, but why
I always thought this church*-tax* is fucking brilliant and we should have it in Turkey too
Yeah all of them make sense, although I still prefer this system over our system, which mosques and other religious related costs are directly funded from the budget
The only thing I wouldn't accept is that your employer knows your affiliation
It can arrangeable, though
I thought the government keeps some of those tax money for the administration cost
If not, then it makes sense
> I'm honestly surprised the Turkish state is funding their mosques directly considering its secular nature
Actually the idea was to control all the mosques and prevent any kind of radicalism by making them civil servant
It surely worked to some extent, but it also had so many adverse affects, which is kind of irrelevant to this topic
Anyways, now we have a government that uses mosques as its political propaganda tool, so it kind of backfired for the moment
In short, I'm just pissed that my tax-money is being spent on some mosques
Well Turkey allows double citizenship but I am going to express something else
There mustn't be allowance for dual citizenship for Turks IMO
The diaspora is abusing their rights, thus they come to Turkey once a year and they think it's all sunshine and rainbows
They are completely silent when we ask why they pay 6K euros for military service if they love their country so much or why they won't return to Turkey
They have no idea of life in Turkey, they are delusional and they must be expelled
&#x200B;
*nawww diaspora turks are upset I see*
I like seeing all countries ridiculed, including my own
Insults are not nice though, for any country
Why not
Not saying they're funny but why particularly Greece
I'm aware
It probably extends to Caucasus, Iran and maybe Levant too, considering my central Anatolian mother also does it
Fun fact: The female version of monster is monstress
Hej, tack så mycket
I opened this account 8 years ago
I was very interested in Swedish culture as some interested in Japanese (Started with Swedish metal music)
Went to Stockholm 2 times, and liked the city a lot, learned the language to some extent, followed news, youtube channels in Swedish etc, but in years intensity of my passion kind of fade away
At some point I thought about finding a job there
But It takes a great effort to find a job in EU from non-EU countries
So it's still kind of dilemma for me
About the weather, I went to Stockholm in February and August
In August it was pretty good
26 degrees is perfect for Summer
In February it was around -8 but humidity made it more comfortable
Language transfer is great
I am listening their Greek classes and it's pretty good
Yes I actually discovered their Turkish course first when I was bored and decided to see how do people learn Turkish lol
I listened just the first few and liked it quite a bit
I can't make comments about the quality of the course with just a few podcast but their technique is very effective especially for languages with little to none relation like Turkish and Greek (or most European languages
Turkish is quite different)
And thanks for the warning
I'll keep this in mind
His Turkish pronunciations are also not great especially vowels and the "L" letter but I guess it's easier to learn for a foreigner with some accent
Promises made by Political Parties
If they promised something during the elections and after being the government, There should be a different department from government to check if they manage to do their plans
If they don’t, there should be repeat elections and banning that party to be in government
If they lied to gain votes, reelection
etc
Sounds of prayer call from mosques
They are irritating and disrespectful
I don't know if you guys have the same problem with church bells
Horn, siren and alarm sounds on the radio
Cigarettes and (maybe) alcohol
What is the hate against alcohol after banning cigarettes
Does alcohol consumption change behaviours in society
Cigarettes,alcohol,adultery
A part of me was cut and taken from me when I was 2 and couldn't defend myself
Law isn't supposed work like this
Our religion order circumcision to us
There isn't a singular objective reality
Everyone has their own version of reality
This makes truth subjective
Which means truth is defined by those with power
And criminalizing lying would be the first step towards a totalitarian society where everyone abides by the state's truth or is punished
I propose another solution: people can stop being absolute gullible retards and don't believe in everything they read instead
Massive cost
What about all the people employed thanks to the existence of cigarettes
I'm not defending cigarettes, but the world isn't black and white
Also if cigarettes enter the illegal drug category, there will be a rise in crime, smuggling, and black market production, and rise of costs on war against drugs
Incarceration of cigarette smokers and producers will be even more costly as jails start to fill up
Like I said it's not black and white
Amen to this
Can you give me an example
What has society been changing due to alcohol consumption in Sweden
It is hard for me to observe the changes in a country where alcohol consumption is lower than average in Europe
If you are muslim,you have to be circumcised
Is Julian Assange a traitor
Let's say that's what the government brands him as
And you came up and said he isn't. You will be prosecuted for not following the ruling party's narrative
What about God
How is it going to work in a country with blasphemy laws
Life isn't 2+2=4
Everyone perceives life through their filters and creates their own reality
This is how human mind works
One might say the sky is purple and the other says the sky is green and they both would be right in their own worlds
Life isn't black and white
One day you are a terrorist the other day you are freedom fighter
One day you are fighting for democracy and freedom the other day you fight for oil
One day you are fighting Eastasia and the other day you are fighting Eurasia, if you know what I mean
In a complex world like this, creating and protecting one absolute and objective truth, one way to look at things, one way to interpret the world is not possible
What you say can work in a system similar to China or North Korea but it can in no way work in a multi-party democracy
Voters need to take some responsibility for their actions instead of blaming everything on some nebulous "system". There will always be bad people, we can only limit them to some extent
Taking it too far is how you get a dystopia
If people are stupid enough, criminalizing lying would solve nothing
There are other forms of manipulation as well
There are a lot of different shades between a lie and a truth
And not everyone lies out of malice
Like I said people create their own worlds and their own realities
I mean it's not some distant past when some people on Earth thought Aryan race is superior to others
Believe me, if "lying" was criminalized during the feudal times, we couldn't have advanced this far
I once paid something like 0
75 CHF  for a beer to a German guy who brought a 24 case at a bbq party
He gave me the price after I asked for one
After 4 years, I'm still processing it
No articles
In these covid days, i am trying to learn german
After one year, i started to feel the article tbh
I wish i had "feelings" about speaking also
Yeah we have a lot of Indian series on certain channels
They are really bad lol
“Çomar”s they are old fashioned people, they don’t question, trust without any condition in politics(like you did something good for them, they will turn their asses for you to fuck”, they usually vote for Erdogan, doesn’t like progress, likes licking asses of people, if it is islam related, it is true then, they like to follow fake news and happy with their minimum wage which right about under 400€ like they can spend 100€ per month and save 300€ while poverty line of Turkey is 1100€ and starvation line is around 350€. I am amused that how they can survive with this excellent intelligent in Turkey’s wildlife and their life style should be documentary voice by National Geographic guy that makes voice over on animal documentaries
I don’t know if it is a streotype type but Turkish elders are really funguys when they are not talking
Their actions are funny and watchable
The thing I hate is we are portrayed in movies as if we live in a desert and all the woman living here wear burqa or hijab
No, we are not an islam state, Turkish Republic has no official religion although (my guess) %70 of the people are muslims
We turks have same laziness (i heard it from a person went to greece) but nobody talks about it
Also you may heard that, there is a racist stereotype in Turkey "Greeks love swimming" this is about greece losing and getting back to aegean isles in the Turkish Inpendenece War (1920-1922)
This is mostly used by kids tbh :P.
Jeez dude calm down
You made me laugh, thank you kind stranger
Happy cake day
Silent, but talk way too much
This is a good situation to say "bruh" very loudly
At least we had a little democracy back then
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk
It will probably take hours to explain what he did for us and my english is not that good when it comes to politics
You can just research it
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk for most people, as the founder of the secular republic
Those who are too conservative would probably disagree, though
But who cares, really
Battle of Gallipoli
Only once
When Mehmet II conquered Constantinople, he entitled himself as "Kaiser-i Rûm (Cesar of Rome)". Also he setted up an Italian campaign to conquer Rome but he lived only enough to see the capture of Otranto Castle
Anatolian Seljuks was called  Sultanate of Rûm but it was because they were formed at old Roman lands
It was more like geographical rather than political
Sorry if my grammar is bad
Just Ottoman Empire
As far as I know, only the Greek patriarchy in Istanbul recognized that claim
And I'm not sure about the chronology, but the Russian Empire made the same claim too
Does anybody know if anyone else recognized Mehmet II as the Ceasar of Rome back then
I see you are a man of culture as well
Taxis which some try to take the long route if he does you can call the police to give him a big fine
(Use Bitaksi App to call one like Uber)
Kebab Restaurant where serves rice next to a kebab(read the menu before ordering it because people who own that place should not be earning any money and send to the deepest place in hell as well as on the planet)
Don’t shop in Every Souvenir Store (Don’t but anything in first souvenir store you see because you might end up getting Chinese ones which there are at same price as local shops with nice hand carving or handmades)
Taxis especially for tourists
Yes,only thinks that should come with a kebab is a bread and some greens
It solely based on memorization and we almost never get to learn the logic behind the stuff we learn, which really sucks as we therefore can't project it into reality ublike in other systems like IB,IGSCE etc
And religion is completely useless as the people that want to learn it already do as their parents generally push it to them while those who don't care at all just sit there often trying to get some sleep as no one really cares or listens to the class
Forced to memorise to pass, Skills other than math is taught as unimportant, Richer you are the better education you get, Under qualified teachers, Every lesson is taught random stuff which doesn’t make it to big picture, If you don’t study, education system will kill you basically
i was gonna write exact same thing for Turkey
I was in Spain last year, although i loved the country there is a lot to criticise in many aspects such as education, politics etc like Turkey
Probably haggis
I didn't expect it to taste well at all
"Greek"...
Tzatziki = Cacik
It is a Turkish dish, not Greek
The word tzatziki is just their way of spelling the word Cacik
All of them okay in here
british occupation flag
when we fight against 5 countries (Turkish İndepence War) UK control İstanbul
UK want do puppet country after Turkish İndepence War
this flag not created by turks but its historical and everybody hate this
mesela
i love both cyprus flag love from turkey <3
whats first cyprus flag
can you send link
thats interesting i live in turkey and i live in bosnian town
mostly they have bars and they hang yugoslavia flags around bar

Osmanlı selçuklu göktürk aç abi sıkıntı yok bizim ülkede
tamam kardeşim yanlis okumusum basliktaki aren't i are diye okudum sağolasın dedigin doğru aklima sadece ingiliz manda plani bayrağı geldi
i saw this i suppose first flag has big differences between present flag . i didnt know thats first flag
i think its nice
The reason why I know how to pronounce this “muvaffakiyetsizleştiricileştiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmişsinizcesine” - meaning "As though you are from those whom we may not easily be able to make into a maker of unsuccessful ones
" or I just say the question that they asked in Turkish
Greece
We need to educate our people ngl
And both sides need to start compromising
Uhmm where should I start
To fix things, we have to elect AKP out first
Then the rest will follow I hope
Though I don’t think the problems in East would be solved so easily
We don’t really hate you per se but Turkish people in Bulgaria have suffered so much, so I guess that raises a negativity
And I’ve always got the feeling that you’re not very fond of us
Backgammon / Turkey
We also have [Okey
] Maybe considerable for second national game
We have same game called “kızma bilader” means “don’t be upset brother” in Turkey
Fun fact, Okey is invented when card games were banned in coffee shops
It's practically a card game with tiles
our capital city probably
since not very touristic (internationally)
it ranks the 2nd by population

Sincap(From Persian): An animal comes from Squirrel Family Tree, lives on trees, usually eats fruit, has too many hair, long tail, has tiny body, Değin(II), Çekelez(Sciurus Vulgaris)
Pronunciation: Sin-job, words in english is the closes you can get as pronunciation in Turkish
Squirrel
That pretty specific but aight, it's "Sincap".
Sincap
Sin=Same pronounciation in english
Cap= can be pronounced like “job” but a little tougher
Its pretty easy for non-natives to pronounce
We should stop looking like cool guy which doesn’t(edit: i meant doesn’t but wrote does) speaks much kind of foreign policy
This hurts Turkey the most where you can let anyone to talk about you and don’t saying anything which is easy for to be accused doing something way out of the line
And we need a new government
Armenian genocide and supporting Palestine instead of Isreal
Yes, yes we do
And I have never met someone who doesn't.
Recep Tayip Erdoğan its sadly 50/50 hopefully in 5 years that will change
menemen (a traditional dish in turkey) is better with/without onions
Soccer if you are from opposite team you are dead specially if there is a Derby
People hate each other because of that
I was a nice name change I think
A lot of people changed quite fast, and even in Turkey, I hear and read comments that either use Çekya(Czechia) or use Çek Cumhuriyeti(Czech Rebuplic) first and correct themselves to Çekya
I guess people didn't really liked the old name
And everyone hates each other because of football (türküm)
If you are interested, I believe most songs of Duman are popular in karaoke here
[Duman - Bu Akşam]
[Duman - Senden Daha Güzel]
[Duman - Her Şeyi Yak]
Affiliated with Arabs in every expect
Only thing that we have common with Arabs is the religion which we still have huge difference in that
Whenever I see Turkey is in a film, they show it like any other desert city in Arab World
There are camels(we don’t have camel as usual but in couple touristic places), women fully closed in black(majority of women in Turkey doesn’t use any type of hijab while fully covered in Black like ninja exist within Arabs in Turkey), men dressed up in white (only imams or some religious people wear those which is very rare), they shot scenes in areas where drought happens every summer to show it like a muslim country that you would expect, Police cars from 1970’s but actually there is not much difference from any European Country and the most importantly any information most likely to be not true or true but not accurate
No, We are not one of the state of Arabia and not every woman wear headscarf or obligated to wear headscarf in here
Okay, Turkey are a Muslim country but it doesnt means we ride camels and speak arabic
Tbh we dont ride camels
There is NO camels except the camels at zoo
And we dont speak arabic
There is still so many neo-ottomanist (nationalist) people but yea Turkey is a modern country, i think
We do not ride camels to get somewhere and not everyone in Turkey wears hijab or burqa
Another thing is, get ready, Istanbul is not the capital of Turkey
Hans bring out ze Flamenwerfer

That is why you eat so much garlic, to differentiate yourself from the vampires

Yes, I can since I was 2 years old and 2 Wheel since I was 4 years old but I haven’t ridden for 5 years
I would really like to see a game about the Spanish Civil War
Brotherland for Azerbaijan and Little Homeland for Cyprus
Also Rumeli (Roman Land) for all of Balkans

Mfw manly hairy arm

they are arabs
we fuck donkeys
Is it bad meaning other than related to Mongols
If not, then it is historically true statement which we are related
"It started in 1939 and ended in 1945
Germany - Italy - Japan fought against USSR - Britain - USA
Germany lost
The war ended when USA bombed Hiroshima & Nagasaki in Japan with 2 atomic bombs
That's it, this is more or less the only paragraph about WW2 in history books in my whole high school life
We just sat and watched
im in high school and i still havent been taught a thing about ww2 so far
This is good to know
When I was in high school, the history teachers pretended like nothing ever happened after Atatürk died in 1938
No WW2, no Cold War, no crisis, no coups, nothing
We were neutral throughout the war (if we exclude last moments of war when we declared war on Germany), thus it didn't affect us who killed who
In school they emphasize a looot more on WW1 and Turkish war of independence btw
Well
(winks in ottoman)
Everytime of ottomans
The Ottoman Empire and Old Middle Asian Turks
Probably Kırıkkale
It's a province that neighbors Ankara and It's sole purpose is to keep Ankara's air clean by building all the factories there
And the funny thing is, the word Kırıkkale means "Broken Castle". And even It's mayor said It's a "meh" city
Here's a depressing [photo] of it
I am from Izmir
People tend to call my way of talk "uneducated and lazy" and "not-cute".
Normally I can speak closer to standard turkish if I am surrounded by non-izmirians, but once I get started to speak with my family and friends from hometown, shit gets real
To be honest, speaking standard Turkish is tiring
Well, noone speaks standard Turkish anyway
Isn't the capital city supposed to have the standard accent
Why is that the case in Sweden
sende (on you) ≠ sen de (you too)
onlarınki (the thing that's theirs) ≠ onların ki (it's theirs, though)
kârımı paylaşıyorum (I'm sharing my income) ≠ karımı paylaşıyorum (I voted for DSP)
The architecture was pretty cool, I don't think Turkey has anything to compare to Brooklyn Bridge, at least in terms of *modern* architecture
Been up in Empire State as well, amazing view
The amount of homeless people, trash on the streets along with the quality of the subway was pretty fucking depressing though
The city could use a lot of investment into utilities
Hahahaha
It was "crazy thief" here
Hahaha is there any anti-russian sentiment there
how did you even get into those situations, OP
> When I was around 10, an adult man groped my butt while we were in a crowded bus
> When I was around 11, boys in my class used to touch the girl's butt and private area and run away
> A one night stand penetrated me without a condom when I had said "no" multiple times beforehand
wow
im so sorry
did these events traumatize you
> 28 year old
thats old
Ironically the Turkish in Germany are whining about "gurbet", telling us how hard it is live abroad and how they love Erdoğan
I watched a video about Turkish immigrants who are living in the UK and supporting Brexit
I was utterly amazed at their way of thinking, it was the stupidest thing
Also I used to have a Polish pen-pal type of thing for a little while 6-7 years ago and she was also talking about the conservatives in your country
It sounded insane, even for middle schooler(?) me
They are literally everywhere here
Apparently been around since at least 1938 too
Barış Özcan
He is a TedX talker and makes videos about everything
From Books he recommends to who Stephen Hawking was
And some of his videos have English subtitles so everyone can check him out
140journos, kind of a documentary news type of channel, This is the best one for me
Barış Özcan, kind of a scientific channel, more like giving informations about things that you might never thought of - i watch him time to time
Doğa İçin Çal, Translation is “Play For The Nature”, Every year they release a song which mostly old folk song(s) which around 60 people sings it, even celebrities joins too, to gain more recognition for nature in public - recommended for Greeks too since there are couple songs which we share
tvMisha, I like her energy into the videos, I can see myself, when sometimes helps me to watch something joyful
Enes Batur gang rise up
Ünsal Ünlü. He's one of the very few news commentators left who can openly criticise the government today
It is more something to do when you are first introduced and in formal settings (if you are going to some other company for business for example, you would shake hands)
In informal settings (between friends and family) it generally evolves to cheek kisses
Myself
Cats I guess, I am more of a reptilian guy
My Country
Fucking cats everywhere, especially in Istanbul
Continent
In Europe, I believe cats are slightly more popular
Asia is too big to speak generally, region-wise Western, Central and northern asia cats are more popular while in southern and eastern Asia dogs are more popular
Personal: Cats
National: Definetely dogs
Cats are everywhere in western Turkey and people get along with them well though
Continental: I have no idea
Turkey is like the non-official cat country of the internet
I’m a cat person as well but dogs are nice too
I am a cat person,Turkey is very well knows with all animals really, but specifically with cats
Plus cats have a special spot within Islam so people hold them dearly
But overall, I'd say Europe is a dog continent, and Asia is a cat continent
Transcontinental gang lez goo
Turkey has quite a few languages despite the latest homogenisation of the culture
Laz language, offshoot of old Greek still spoken in the Black Sea region
The famous whistling language, which doesn't have words but melodies, is whistled in the mountains of Black Sea
There is the Zaza language, which is another Kurdish dialect distinct from Gourmanji (widely known as the Kurdish)
Other languages which are spoken as native languages by minorities in Turkey are Azeri, Turkoman, Karapapak, Bosniak, Bulgarian, Greek, Aramean, Arab, Circassian, Georgian and Abkhazian
ASML is well-known to Turkish engineers
The fez is banned but nobody wears it seriously anyway so it's not enforced
At this point it's just a costume
>Making fun of the German president (not chancellor) is being punished
If enforced, a law like this is one of the best tools to be abused by a tyrant
It's a ticking timebomb I can guarantee you that
We also had that law
We didn't notice it either and look where that lead us
Criticism is abstract in nature, any criticism of the government can be twisted and bent into "insulting the president".
If we can count Istanbul, definitely Istanbul
If not, Athens
1-Istanbul (One of the most important cities in the world, not just Balkans)
2-Athens (Base of the Western culture)
3-Sarajevo (Jerusalem of the Europe)
Well, half(actually more like 60%) of it is in Thrace
Which is Balkan
Well, most of the financial centers and the population is on the European part
But then, the Asian part is also pretty important
In any case, even if you count the European part only it'd be the most populous Balkan city
Pretty solid evidence for both the pre-Turkic history and Turkic history of Anatolia
Every now and then people find fragments of ancient statues or temples, not even counting the structures that remain standing
Many people view history biased
For example, we are not Mongols and we are not Arabs too
Often such a result is due to distorted expressions
Even if we look at the thousand years that passed with our arrival in Anatolia, we have a dense history
There is already before
Credit Cards with NFC, Cash(only applies for minibuses), -insert city name- Card or Tickets
But Government is now changing to one card system for every city and transportation
We have a card you can put money in, you also can download the app and pay with your phone or you can use your credit card to pay but no one does that
Same, except we do it only when we board
There are also chip readers in train and metrobus stations that you hold your card against, it automatically calculates the amount of money to be repaid when you exit the bus/train
we say the first food cones to mind ends with an "i"
peynir=cheese
sosis=sausage
piliç=chicken
Ask whatever you want but dont ask camels
We dont use them here
Erdoğan is getting weaker, i hope he wont be our president in a few years
The tallest person on earth and the person with the biggest nose are turkish and live in Turkey
Also technically money was invented in Turkey by Lydinans
Also also Turkey is the country with the highest consumption of tea
I think it was around 631 days or something like that
I saw a video about it today lol
>kebab shops are in turmoil, doners are woefully incomplete
The fuck kinda döner do you people eat
Turkey would be in shambles
You can’t have Döner, Kebap of İskender without potatoes
Apparently some people even put yogurt in döner
Now that's just gross
Imma throw up
Just no yogurt, please
Basketball is pretty crazy here when it's with fans
We have had all kinds of violence in basketball
We would be the uncle that starts up shit with absolutely everyone on the dinner table for no reason that everyone reacts awkwardly to the presence of
We would also talk about how everything used to be better back in the day
Probably sit with Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and definitely cook with them
Enjoy the food, get drunk and try to kill each other while arguing which Empire was the best
Argue with Greece about who invented the food, then tell them that their version of it tastes like shit anyway
Can we cook
Balkans are a cursed place
That’s a second ideal table
Wars with Muslim states while Turks were Tengrist
Also Romans
It is exactly opposite in Turkey
We were taught very well about WW1
On the other hand WW2  was just a few paragraphs on books unless you take an advanced history class
Probably, It is because of we did not take part in
I have learnt nearly everything on my own
I just want to ask
Did you guys get taught about the battle of Gallipoli
Or they just skipped it
it seems awesome, kinda peace/anti war propaganda
We always talk about wars which were mostly won, tactics, commanders, sultans
We talk about  how our ancestors were great soldier and how they ruled the world
We do not talk about a lot about people and their sufferings
I think,The Republic Era and WW1 are in the context  you mentioned
At a minimal level, so it's not a tradition
The tradition is to make sure that mothers are over-protective and children are not given a chance to develop their personality as individuals
i think what makes this sub at least functional for a Turk like myself is the low subcount
which makes it less toxic compared to r/europe
Aged 21 and I don't remember I have gone once
The doctor thing kinda scary
Some people don't even know what is the Seljuk Empire
Literally everything can i say
Because they even taught us the second political parties' ideologies, I personally would be surprised if they taught anybody abroad
We must read your book about how to forge a country
The Country Of White Lilies
Dude we were your archnemesis
We learn some stuff about your country
We learn about you in history and religion class
The book was made mandatory by Atatürk in the 1930s. It isn't mandatory now but still, some schools make us read it
It is a quick read
It tells us how a nation succeeds
It tells how Finland wasn't autonomus while it was in Sweden
And then the Russians conquered it and gave it autonomy
It tells about some of the reforms in education and bureocracy
I recommend it to you
You can finish it on a long bus ride
How friendly do you consider your country for non-EU expats/immigrants ?
Do expats/immigrants have a hard time making things work out for them or integrating to the culture of your country ? How do natives view non-Eu immigrants ?
For me idk
One of my friends said that she would never tell where she is from just in case
She has blond hair and fair complexion so people don't usually think that she is turk right away
One of my other friends said that he would always be sure to be well-groomed
But my brother who stayed in Gröningen for a bit said that he didn't encounter anything bad
Is it because of prejudice or culture when it comes to Africans or people from the middle East ? Do you think someone from these countries who is completely integrated with the German culture and has the same mindset ,shares the same values  will be treated same as let's say a Japanese immigrant ?
I think expat means someone who works in a foreign country but doesn't plan on staying there on the long term whereas immigrants are permanent residents .
Damn I got triggered reading this , I don't want to be associated with any of that especially the BMW disco music part lol .
No idea tbh
I know and the wierd thing is Turks from Turkey don't like Turks in Germany either bc of these stereotypes and their behaviours
Not all of us have pizza cutter, so we use knifes
But scissors
Doesn't feel right
Justinian 1: Eastern Roman Empire was very big under his reign
Constantine XI: Was a good rival
One of the few, not evil Emporer
So I'd say that's a good choice
Black sea region, or eastern Turkey in general,really
Adana, south eastern turkey, mostly populated by immigrants
Its Florida of turkey basically
İstanbul: Let's take the city of the world's desire, run it somewhat alright for a few centuries, then completely fuck it up with immigration, unplanned growth and chaos after the 60s. 17 million people with some who have never seen the sea even though the city is surrounded by sea on al sides
Still has some of the most beautiful areas though
And I have been to many, many cities around the world
Ankara: Let's take a small town that is somewhat strategically safe during the Liberation War and make it the capital and completely fuck it up with unplanned growth and immigration
But has a very modest population, all of whom work for the government in one way or another
Nobody loves the city but I do
İzmir: Let's take a Greek town and leave it alone for centuries and then completely fuck it up with unplanned growth and immigration after the 60s. But let's also fill it with lots of beautiful girls and good people
They're too proud of themselves for my taste but it's a good place overall
2 hour drive to any wonderful holiday spot
>  involuntary treatment,
It might be true, but I'm sure that there are some laws that protect the kid's healthy
What happens if a kid gets cancer and the parents don't want the treatment
It's a genuine question btw, not rhetorical
Carl Gustav XII is Demirbaş Şarl (Ironhead Sharl)
and Charles the Fifth translates to “Şarlken” Don’t know why
If it counts, the stereotype about Jewish people with money has never been my experience at all
Including the tourists from Israel
I worked at a 5-star hotel for nearly 2 years and have close friends who still do
We haven't noticed any difference at all with most other groups I can think
We *could* name at least three groups of people who are offensively cheap with money, they are not one of them
Ooh I can't give names but let's just say it's not a nation in Europe, America, or Australia
their understanding of tips is limited to coins
They can spend $2,000 on their dinner, have extra requests from the staff, but will tip like 10 pennies
And they even give that in rude "take this generosity and leave, peasant" ways
Their political state is also "generous to themselves/to their own wealthy, super cheap with helping others
don’t go eastern cities where the kurds are majority and in west turkey just avoid where the kurds, gypsies and romans live, just a couple of neighbourhoods
What are some good rock/metal songs from your country for my playlist ?
Hi, recently I am making a playlist from rock/metal music from different countries
I made up some rules for my playlist
\- The song has to be in the native language (in one of them if there are more than one)
\- There need to be one song from each country
\- It would be great if the song involve a national instrument (optional)
\- It would be great if the song have some distinctive elements about the country (optional)
Thank you
i think it's [Baris Manco - Donence]
but especially with local insturments: [Cem Karaca & Mogollar - Obur Dunya]
&#x200B;
for Turkey
Model - Buzdan Şato
You definitely should check it out
The group is no longer active but the song never gets old :)
>Villagers of Ioannina City
Definitely got my attention
Thank you
That's a lot of song to listen :)
The song is pretty good
It took the place for Hungary for now
>Viikate - Pohjoista Viljaa
This filled the place for Finland for now unless something better will come
It is pretty great
>It’s quite ”light” metal though, takes influences from Finnish shlager
No problem at all
I added metal to the question just to add verity
I think I will go with Iron Maiden for UK
Since I know a lot more music from us
This is the hardest decision :)
And that helped a lot with Bulgaria
Thank you
Italy's place currently filled with your [2021 Eurovision participant] :)
It will stay until something better will come
>punk rock band than a metal band
This is fine
I don't look for metal groups specifically
I look for hard rock/heavy metal genres
You suggestion is also good
I like punk rock
"Ies" got into the list
I really liked the band as well
But Romania will be hard since I heard some great rock songs from Romania before
The HU is already in the list
Amazing, added to the list
>I wouldn't say that they qualify as a rock band
The band don't have to be Rock band
The song should be, also "Zitti e buoni" is currently in the list for Italy, but it can change
Thanks for the suggestions I will check them
>Also in case you are eventually missing any countries, there are some
>incredible lists
> over at
>r/IndigenousMetal
> that might help you
This helped a lot thank you
>I see the others suggested you VIC for Greece
I think it fits very nicely to your criteria, they are awesome
I chose the band for my list the real question is which song
It really is great
> Also in case you are eventually missing any countries, there are some [incredible lists] over at [r/IndigenousMetal] that might help you
Also thank you for the suggestion I will check it out
I know :)
Turkey would be a lot harder than other countries since I know a lot more songs
>Extremoduro
Song in this link is in the list for Spain for now
It is pretty great
Thank you
The song is actually pretty great
But yeah it conflicts with native language rule
lol i did not notice your flair
anyways, wish you great day
>Falconer - Vid rosornas grav
I know this song and loved it but forgot its name
Yeah this will be the one for Sweden
Thanks
Aa Türk müydün hiç dikkat etmemiştim hahaha :))
My initial plan is to put one per country it would be really crowded anyways because it won't be limited with Europe, but there will be a lot of replacements when I found better song from a country
So I am always open for suggestions :)
Erdoğan and his beloved Abdülhamit
Kenan Evren, the commander-in-chief during the coup of 1980 was probably the worst
An 17 year-old leftist kid (Erdal Eren) was sentenced to death although the decision was overruled by the supreme court twice
His age was ruled to be one year older by the court to make the execution possible
Evren's comment was sarcastic:
"Should we feed them (for the rest of their lives) instead of hanging them
He was also sarcastic about the 1961 constitution since he found it "too democratic". He said:
"That constitution was too loose for us
We'd started to play in it".
On freedom of speech:
"We don't tell our intellectuals to stop thinking
It's just enough if they don't tell their thoughts to others".
Erdoğan ( still president) won 3 elections
Most of my people are dumb
Kösem Sultan, a female regent who tried to have the ruler murdered
> atrocities
you mean genocide
In that terms, Armenian Genocide wasn't a genocide either since most of Armenian wasn't even re-located specially the ones were at western side of Anatolia
When did I deny anything Turkey has ever done
I'm sick of hypocrisy of other countries
If some another country has done similar things it is atrocities
if Turkey has done, it is genocide
fuck this shit
The hypocrisy part is negligible of the incident
Noone bites an eye about what Belgium had done in there but when it comes to Turks, everyone goes nuts
Btw, you are the first person who said Ottomans not Turks about genocide
Turkish:
Teşekkürler - exact translation: thanks
Teşekkür ederim- e.t.: I thank
Çok teşekkürler- e.t. Many/very thanks
Sağol- e.t. Be alive/live (a very delicate way to thank someone, not so formal tho
Sağolasın- May you be alive (another delicate way, with more gratitude)
Sayende- Under your shadow/with your shadow/thanks to your shadow (this is arguably the most delicate way to thank someone for their effort and help
Saye comes to Turkish from Persian, meaning shadow
Their shadow represents the indirect effects their efforts might have on a persons actions/wishes)
Teşekkür ederim: singular
Teşekkür ederiz: plural
Ministry of Education gives a 100 book recommendations list each year with small changes
60  book from Turkish literature, 30 from foreign literature, 10 others and theaters
Students, teachers or they together choose which books they will read
"Autobahn" or as it is in Turkish "Otoban"
We have some
Kuruş, bitter, vasistas, şnorkel, şalter, zeplin, general, dikta, dekan, element, genetik, otoban, revir
These are some of the German words in the Turkish language
There are more if you're interested
I had long hair for 10+ years
Never heard a negative comment about it
Except playful comments from immediate family
It was big no-no in high school though
Every monday they would check us for hair and beard length
If it's just beard you could shave in the bathroom but if it was hair, they wouldn't let you in
I had to jump through the school wall to get in, for the last month of high school
My hair was very long until August and every male i know (except my dad) was ok with it
Girls was jelous tho
lmao
peygamberdevesi
it means "prophet's camel"
weird
"Peygamberdevesi". Which means "Prophet's camel".
It's made of two words "Peygamber" (prophet, Persian) and "Deve" (camel, Turkish)
"Peygamberdevesi" roughly translates to THE PROPHET CAMEL
Peygamber devesi
Which translates to “camel of the prophet”. Why
I don’t know :(
[Tarkan - Şımarık] (also known as Kiss Kiss but literal translation is Sassy) might be the most popular song internationally
You have probably heard of [kuzu kuzu by tarkan ] but these days its [patlamaya devam by isyan tetick]
It seems like we tried to balance our relations with Nazi Germany by being nice but not so nice
We were kind of neutral to them through most of the war
Germany wanted us to enter the war on their side and even promised us land but fortunately we refused it
Not in Europe but I have visited Alanya Kalesi, it's in Antalya

The war of independence, the declaration of the republic, abolishment of the khalifate and the sultanate, and the reforms after that
Turkish war of independence, resulting to the formation of the secular republic and start of the reformation era led by one of the most influental person of the 20th century, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk
That's a pretty interesting protest, i was really amazed when i first heard about the singing revolution
Sick
We have war if independence too
yeah, but when the ottomans collapsed literally everyone decided to invade anatolia, and we kicked them out in the war of independence, abolished the sultanate, and declared a republic
Empire lost at WW1
Sultan gave country to British, Italian, French, Greek, Armenian
Most succesful soldier of the WW1, Mustafa Kemal started a war of independance in 1919
He fought against all that countries and abolished Sultanate in 1922
He declared the republic in 1923
We are a country that smaller than 100, but we had a major change after war of independence
But I would answer as the reforms after the war not the war itself
Well, in theory, we are still secular
But in act, we are not even secular as much as theocratic UK since 1981
Or greece who just adopted secularism
In fact, we are among the most religiously/conservatively governed secular countries
Anti-secularization policies were started back in 1950s, but thankfully, they weren't able to make much progress since they were acting against Ataturk's reforms and they dragged Turkey into an enormous economic crisis that effected 70% of the population, which led to a coup taking over in 1960
Nearly all of the anti-secularization progress were made after the 1981 coup
That coup was backed by the USA's McCarthyist government and intelligence agencies
After that, Turkey started turning into a pro-conservative politically corrupt country
Which led to the today's Erdogan era
From Ottoman Empire actually
There were two different ruling points after WW1
One as a rebel government in Ankara ruled by Atatürk, one in İstanbul ruled by the Sultan
The war was actually against the countries involved in [the treaty of Serves]
Treaty of Sevres was way worse than Treaty of Versailles
Also British, Italian and French were there o colonize those lands
You’re like the anti-Greek
Next you’ll tell me you don’t like to take on debt
Same, a family of 4 in turkey consumes at least 6 breads  a day
It's a Balkan thing
Zeugma museum(Gaziantep City), Istanbul aviation museum, Topkapı palace, Maiden's tower, Beylerbeyi palace, war museum, pera museum, mısır apartmentz papadoulos apartment, few more apartments, modern art gallery, archeology museum, islam technology and science museum, sea museum, Yerebatan cistern, whole Üsküdar, Fatih, Beyoğlu, Karaköy districts, camondo stairs and a lot more
Damn I love Istanbul
>archeology museum
Can confirm
I like archaeology - only in an amateur sense - and 2 years ago I went to the Istanbul archaeology museum for my birthday
I spent 6 hours there and would have probably stayed much longer if I didn't have other plans
(I went back of course
) It's my personal favorite tied with the Anatolian Civilizations Museum in Ankara
Some others to mention: Istanbul toy museum, Koç Museum, Naval Museum in Beşiktaş, Archaeological museum in Antalya, Çorum Museum (for Hittite history)
Oh yes, I forgot to type about those
Thanks
I am guessing Greece and Turkey’s answer would Cyprus if we don’t consider water as a border
Other than it would be Italy for Turkey
I would say its actually the best city or the second best, has all the advantages of İstanbul, but also has the advantages of having about 1/3 of istanbuls population
and also has a proper mayor now
In our capital people don’t know how to drive, outside of our capital people know how to drive
ankara: kickass mayor
rest of the cities: utter shite mayors
it is
or rather it was until recently since it got rigged
It is and almost everyone buys it
No one thinks that they would win, but everyone still keeps buying it
In Turkey, replace every "Christmas" with "New Year" and that's it
So yeah
We have a New Year Lottery
In Turkey, it is also New Year's Eve
Well, we don't celebrate Christmas anyways
Eastern(most) region or Western (most) region for entirely different reasons
East: There are lots of Kurdish citizens living there and already have some seperatist movements
(The topic is really contravertial and I don't feel knowledgeble enough)
West: Much less likely to secede
There is an obvious West-Rest division on political views
Western part is a lot more secular and richer than rest of the country
do i really need to answer
south-eastern Kurdish separatism is already a thing,
there are some eastern Anatolian Armenian speaking "pockets"
there are also laz people but to my knowledge, they never tried to secede from neither turkey nor ottomans
While I don't think its likely for the Southeast to secede, it is the only region that has some kind of reason to
For those who don't know Turkish geography, that means regions where Kurds are the majority or a very large minority
[This] map may help you understand
It is Turkish but its mainly numbers so you can understand
Red is Erdoğan, Blue is secular votes, Purple is Kurdish votes with a bit
exaggeration
But the previous map changed after the last [local elections] But I prefer general elections as indicator
People don't vote to mayors as they vote to government
In this new map brown is ally of Erdoğan, red is secular, purple is Kurdish, orange is Erdoğan
Look at the other map on my other reply to u/young_chaos
İstanbul voted secular on latest election on 2019
Even tough it was local elections it still had really big impact on Turkish politics
In fact government didn't accept the results and remade the elections just in İstanbul just to be defeated with a bigger margin
İstanbul is just Pygmy Turkey
I think we share this sentiment with most Balkan countries: stray dogs are not seen as problems
They are well taken care of and are our friends
Cats are everywhere in Turkey but no one sees them as stray
It's more like they are where they belong
They own this country, their homeland
Touristic places have big populations of stray dogs, usually pedigree, due to people going on holidays with a new puppy and leaving it there
our streets are full of stray animals but we don't see it as a problem
They are not strays, they are community *members* that we like to take care of
Massive fucking problem, every other day on the news there is someone who got mauled by the packs of dogs
Worse, "animal rights activists" get up and raise hell whenever someone suggests fixing the problem
The cats are fine though
We love our cats
In Turkey, we want and feed them all
Cats and dogs are live happily
You cans watch on Google and YouTube
There is a short film about it called 'Kedi' or 'the cat'
it's a colossal problem here in turkey
and the people exacerbate it
those so called "animal lovers" are actually very cruel people
they leave food on the street and prevent the animal control (municipalities) do their job
why
for a quick instagram photo or just for a quick pet
if you love animals so much, get one indoors at your home
don't just leave bit of leftovers just for easing your mind
what happens in reality: cats and dogs eat garbage and breed
more misery is spread
no developed nation has this stray problem
In Turkey, there are stray packs almost everywhere
They're fed so they are hardly aggressive
[they are a problem if you are old or a child]
In Turkey we don't call free cats "strays". They happily live where they have always lived and are usually taken care of by people
but stray dogs are kind of a problem but cats are lovely
In every street you will see atleast two stray cats
Stray dogs are not a problem as well
They are since there are so many of them they are very hungry and they attack everything they see
One of my friends work in a industrial area and he always tells me how dogs there attack cars and rip their parts of
That’s kinda how the food chain works though
Do you get mad when cats eat rats
Dogs in cities are fed and usually very friendly but if they live in rural areas with a pack they have to be more wild and territorial if they want to survive
Cats are better predators than dogs are so they are a threat for them
It’s a normal reaction
So its a problem
No, i dont want to put myself in danger just because bunch of people love stray dogs
that kind of dogs are in big places like karşıyaka (i live in izmir so i am giving places in izmir as an example)
In smaller neighbourhoods dogs even attack people
There are shelters for dogs already
What do you suggest
Kill stray dogs or turn shelters into kill shelters
I believe we should put most of these stray dogs in to shelters but the problem with that is shelters are very low quality
There are not enough shelters
If you don’t turn them into kill shelters -shelters that kill dogs/cats after a certain time limit- shelter option is not an option
Leave it as it is, kill stray dogs, turn shelters into kil shelters: you need to choose between one of these because another option is not economically feasible
Kebab is not a sandwich its a way of preparing meat Döner which is a type of meat,between two breads is a sandwich
Kebab is a different food group its incorrect to call a Döner Kebab a Kebab
Ankara is the brain and Istanbul is the heart of Turkey
Ankara makes decisions government is there
Istanbul is economically, historically and with population it is like second capital
Far as I know Turkey is centralised
I heard that Amsterdam has a flag
Is that true
Interesting
I used to think cities (or states) having flags was only in the US but apparently a lot of cities have flags
Hatay did have a flag, but they were independent at the time
We have coat of arms for every city but only hatay has a flag
Most of the coat of arms have a mosque on them
During my studies, we didn’t have any required but recommended list
The most difficult one was Nutuk
It was recommended to read in 8th grade and it is full of words that I didn’t know and experience was like you can read it but don’t understand a thing at all
This is why I have hard time remembering it
You can work your butt of in highschool to get in the first 1000 to study medicine for 7 years and start working for 350 euros a month
Turkey moment
There's something about Swedish that sounds so melodic, so I'll have to go with that
Government propoganda, TRT
But we also have different popular channels too
TRT1=(Turkish Radio Television) used to only tv channel in turkey back in the day now they produce turkish tv series about turkish history such as :
Diriliş Ertuğrul(Osman's father),
Kuruluş Osman(ottoman emp
founder),
Payitaht Abdülhamit (one of last and significant ottoman sultan)
And some series about Turkish war of independence
they are nice and some are very popular around south america asia and africa
They produce tv series with our tax money
You forgot to mention they are a state propaganda channel
yeah, they produce propoganda series like [Teskilat] [Kizilelma] [Ertugrul] or [Filinta] with our taxes
I guess they do, their production quality is better than older years
You can't answer negative questions with yes/no
İf someone asks you "Didn't you go there ?", no matter you say yes or no, you will be saying that you didn't go there so in order to avoid confusion, you have to reconstruct the entire sentence like: No/Yes, I didn't/did go there
Not a big deal but annoys me a lot
There are too many foreign words in our language
People use too many foreign words when it isn't needed and it's annoying
We have a circumflex for when vowels have different pronunciations but nobody ever uses them so it is common to make reading mistakes
For example, hâla(yet, still, regardless) is generally written the same as but pronounced different than hala(aunt on paternal side per blood)
Regarding the hala point, we also have annoyingly specific terms for family, like baldız(sister-in-law), bacanak(the husband of one's wife's sister) or görümce(the sister of one's husband) or elti(the wife of one's husband's brother)
Confusing, I know
Yeah it bugs the hell out of me too
They’re mostly pretentious college kids who thinks using an English word in a sentence makes them look intelligent or cool
It doesn’t.
Karakter means charachter in Turkish lol
French, Persian, Arabic are the most common ones as far as i know
Although for French people  wouldn't know it's French, they'd think it was English
For example words ending with -tion
>when people use the english word when there's an equivalent
> but do people use it noo lets just take the english word and pronounce it wrong
This is the exact situation
Why use stupid fake words (customised from their origins to try to fit the Turkish language) when you can use the proper ones in your own language
It drives me crazy
There is a small movement about this situation but it isn't well heard as far as I know
Nonetheless people directly assume that you're a "Türkçü/Ülkücü" (that's what nationalists get called) when you use the actual Turkish word instead of some stupid Persian/Arabic words and phrases
#####TLDR; we're on the same page
Exactly lol
We have the same thing in Turkish
*Ottoman Empire intensifies*
Greece, Bulgaria, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Georgia
Well, this should be fun
Closest relations or geographically to capital
If its the former, that'd be Azerbaijan
Happy marriage
If it's the latter, that'd be Bulgaria
Not exactly a happy marriage but it could be managed, considering we far outnumber them and I don't think the relations are as bad as say, Greece or Armenia
idk
When I would see Switzerland having 4 official languages I didn't realize it was regional so I thought everyone spoke all those 4 languages + English
I was incredibly impressed since I was struggling so hard just to learn English
In turkish Sweden is "İsveç" and Switzerland is "İsviçre". I believe most people in Turkey are just like you
always has been
well, this applies to 80% of western europeans

That's a surprise now
I have a feeling that he's known better abroad than inland

Not sure about the name but "Miracle in cell no
It is really popular
It used to be more popular at these days beards were referred as  "makeup of the males". This is changing thought, there are a lot of teenage girls in Turkey that admire beardless Korean man in K-pop videos
Kind of but it's kinda hard for turkish people to grow moustache cause not being indo-european and all
Yes kind of
[This] would be Islamist moustache
[This] would be Turanist moustache
These are not that common strong symbols anymore but still exist and avoided by people with opposing ideas
Yes kind of
That moustache can change a lot
Turanist moustache has much more stable look
I am hesitant to say something good because we thrive when we are the underdogs but do dogshit when we think we are good
And it looks like we are in form right now, so we will lose against Wales and Swiss :D and draw against Italy
My realistic expectation is to reach round of 16
If we reach round of 16 and exit the tournament, I would feel dissatisfied but not disappointed
If we reach quarter-finals, it would be above my expectations and would feel satisfied
More than that is a bonus
I think our defense is very elite this year but we lack offensive power
So it should be enough in the group stage but after that it just comes to luck
We have a good generation this time, I hope we can use that

Considering Turkish is spoken by more than 75 million people as a native language and the fact that Turkish speakers generally have poor English, absolutely not
Thanks to our bad education system students at only private schools can speak decent english so there is no risk for Turkish
I guess the Turkish "eşkıya" who were some kind of bandits, although they also usually did vigilantism in areas without law&order
They remained commonplace in rural Turkey until the 1940s when finally stamped out by the gendarmerie
So that's where Turkish "haydut"(outlaw) comes from
Haydut here, means bandit, i love how all our cultures connect at one point
In the future
In 1924

Lol not all of them are from a single country
Nevermind my answer
6 total and 3 of them are in Istanbul so I wouldn’t call it easily accessible
daha fazladir
ankara, bursa, antalya, izmir var
belki baska bir sehirde daha vardir ya da ankara'da 2 tane olabilir
Senin dediklerin showroom kardeşim muhtemelen Wikipedia 6 diyo ben İstanbul dışında hiç görmedim ama İstanbulda 3 var ona eminim
Tabi update’lenmemiş olma ihtimali fazla
yok ben de baktim sitesine toplam 7 tane var
birkac tane de siparis noktasi var ayri olarak
Nah, not much of a problem
Everyone's black around here
Most people here are agreed that turkey is transcontinental and kind of its own thing
You'd rarely encounter someone who identifies as just European or Asian
As for the European part, it certainly is in Balkans
Depends on the region you are in mostly
North East of turkey is influenced by Russians , therefore Caucasian while south eastern turkey is dominated by middle eastern culture
West of Ankara , however is considered European
Generally speaking, I consider Turks  a mixture of middle eastern and Balkan culture
>Most people here are agreed that turkey is transcontinental and kind of its own thing
You'd rarely encounter someone who identifies as just European or Asian
This is more of a cultural or identity thing
Turks don't fit themselves to either middle east or Europe but people don't think Anatolia is its own continent lol :)
Turkey is a pretty diverse country
most Germans think we are hairy Arabs since we sent you our peasants as workers but when Germans have a trip to urban parts of Turkey they are surprised
Because we are not living in a movie, yes we do
I think shoes are pretty disgusting to wear in houses, we have slippers for indoors instead
Döner
There are 2 versions of it, chicken döner can be very cheap
But it can be dangerous too
Chicken is not too safe to eat from cheap places
Tacos
*(if i can consider georgia as my country)* [mcdonalds] [in batumi] ate once there, i have to admit that the place makes you wanna eat there
[İzmir’in Dağlarında Çiçekler Açar
] Even if this is different version of Caucasian March but this has the meaning of Greeks finally left city of Izmir
As well as representing end of Independence War
(Edit) [You can check out this version as well
[Hey Onbeşli] Story behind is that when 15 years old kids went to front line in Çanakkale(Gallipoli) as a soldier
[Different version of this song to get more attention towards nature
(with English subtitles)]
Each city or area has its own songs but these are known by nearly everyone
These songs are what I can think of right now
You can add more if there are other songs as well
İzmir Marşı.
İzmir Marşı, it's a song about the Turks entering İzmir (Which was invaded by Greeks) during The Turkish War of Independence
No, its very uncommon thing
Also they are so cute how dare people ate them OwO
O_o
Oh shit, just opened the thread to do that, and called out by top comment :D
Fun fact: We pronunce 10 as “on”. So Neon is very easy to learn
Ne10
lets see
As a general rule, it seems that elements widely found in pre-industrial society have Turkish names that obviously do not fit with their symbols:
Kurşun(Pb)
Kükürt(S)
Demir(Fe)
Çinko(Zn)
Gümüş(Ag)
Altın(Au)
Kalay(Sn)
Elements discovered later on tend to fit:
Uranyum(U)
Karbon(C)
So, most elements out there "make sense" but the vast majority talked about in daily life do not, hydrogen and helium being notable exceptions
Pretty much none unless you are in big cities
Also excluding pizza&pasta
Döner ftw
do you like kebab
are you greek
why you write this
i dont understand
It is always said geography is destiny whenever something happens
**Süleyman the Magnificent** (1494-1566) who was the 10
Sultan and among many things he was a very good poet
His divan (a collection of poems) has this famous 4 liner, where the first 2 ones are used in everyday life when the context arrives
*Halk içinde mûteber bir nesne yok devlet gibi*
*Olmaya devlet cihânda bir nefes sıhhât gibi*
*Saltanat didükleri ancak cihân gavgâsıdır*
*Olmaya baht u saadet dünyâda vahdet gibi*
**Translation**:
*There isn't another respected object among people like fortune*
*Fortune isn't worth as much as a healthy breath in this world*
*The thing as they call reign is just a world's struggle*
*There shan't be any happiness in this world without unity*
PS: today we use the word "devlet" as "state". So insead of the word "fortune", you can switch it with "state". It gives more depth to the poem as Süleyman was a statesman
How are we using this in daily life and in popular media
When we want to say that there is nothing more valuable than health, then we quote Süleyman
Saying that even our most powerful ruler (or one of the most powerful ruler) did say that as the ruler of everything
Even he acknowledged that there is something more important than ruling/fortune/reign
I love it because I don't remember we have played against Italy so far and we are going to play other matches in Azerbaijan, so we are a kind of host to the games
We played against Italy in Euro 2000 group stage
But yeah it has been a while
I am also happy that we will play in Azerbaijan
We call it "ve işareti" or "ve imi" meaning "and sign". Or we just call it "ampersant".
It isn't officially used in Turkish but I believe there's a Turkish version of it as well
Made with combining V and E in a calligraphic way like Æ.

Salad and meat is enough
Maybe some tomato sauce
1) Geographic location
Ankara is pretty much at the center of Turkey
2) When it first became capital, it was a railway hub
3) It had a pretty strategic location and wasn't occupied by the Entente during the War of Independence, making it a prime spot to base the Kemalist government in
4) Ataturk wanted to build a new city to symbolize the break from the past
Ankara, which was a small town at the time, was the perfect place to build the modern European-style metropolis Ataturk envisioned, compared to Istanbul which was a major city with a population of 900,000
Mostly because of its strategic location in the geographical centre of Turkey
Also, the parliament coordinated the war efforts from Ankara, so it was a symbolic decision
The other option would be Istanbul but it had been the capital of the empire for hundreds of years and thus was symbolising the monarchy; not to mention that it was dangerously close to the border now that the country has lost most of her land in the Balkans
Because Ankara is harder to invade compared to the old Ottoman Capital İstanbul and at the centre of Anatolia
Also its people supported the Independence War which allowed Atatürk and his friends to open a senate and organise elections
İstanbul was the last capital of Ottoman Empire
But İstanbul wasn't a safe place due to WW1 and monarchy losing its authority at Ottoman Empire
So they decided to build a parliament to declare democracy in the country
But first they needed to make sure it's at a safe place
So they chose Ankara, which is nearly in the middle of the land
Even after the parliament building being reconstructed 2 more times, Ankara is still the capital of Republic of Turkey
Oh, Istanbul’s population growth wasn’t natural, most of it was driven by immigration from lesser-developed provinces
For comparision, Turkey’s population grew about 8 times in 100 years(10 million to 83 million), while Istanbul grew 20 times(900,000 to 18 million estimated)
Ankara grew by 100 times, from 50,000 to 5 million today
My grandfather did his military service in Istanbul in the late 1950's. While I'm sure his eyes are tinted by nostalgia to a degree, he says the Istanbul of that time was way better - "a lot of green spaces, no concrete monsters and little traffic" in his words
It's a shame most of its beauty was destroyed
And Antwerp was probably the commercial center of Low Countries
Amsterdam rose because the new Dutch state blockaded Antwerp, and the trade then got rerouted to Amsterdam
During the 80 Years' War, the elites from Holland had gained major influence, so they actually were against recapturing Antwerp in the later years of the war
In summary, I think Amsterdam became first a very important city and then the capital because the Dutch lost Antwerp during 80 Years' War
Sikimden aşağı kasımpaşa - Below my dick kasımpaşa (Kasımpaşa is a name of an area in İstanbul)
Çok da fifi - very much fifi (I have no idea what fifi is
Çok da sikimde - It's very much on my dick (There is an irony here
We mean It's not on my dick
I  believe we can say the same for the Çok da fifi
Yes we have “Umdumda değil/ önemsemiyorum” which mean “I don’t care” but then we also have “takmıyorum” which literally mean I don’t wear same as wearing jewellery which in Turkish is “Takı” and I think that’s where the word “takmak” derived from
Its really sounding natural when you say it in Turkish though
I don’t care about you at all = Seni hiç takmıyorum which literally translate to I don’t wear you at all
“Sikimde değil” translates to “Not on my dick“ yet it means “I don’t care“. I suppose this is a slang but still you wouldn’t understand it
Koy götüne - Fuck its ass
You forgot most used one which is: "Sikimde değil
" Literal translation: "It's not on my dick
Yeah weird thing is it’s used by both sexes lol

CRITICAL HIT
IDK Why people are that mad over a caricature
As a muslim macron doing well ı dont want known as terrorist because of some idiots
I'm an exmuslim from Turkey
I have to say that most of our people doesnt pray daily
At highest it can be %10 percent
Not more of it
But as you know
Erdogan supporters are always acts like they are the most religious ones
Etc etc
When this thing happened in our country most of us really devastated
As you can guess the akp supporters normalised it somehow
Our youth is growing open-minded and not-religious
This is my only hope
And I also hope that We will be in eu with our european brothers and sisters with good meanings and civilised in the future
Im kinda full of thoughts as you can see
Thats why I needed to write something at the comments
Thanks you for reading

french presidents use it alot
Honestly Apple probably would have switched on their own at some point
They invested enough into the USB-c standard already
Now they have somebody to point at when the consumers grab their pitchforks
I'm sure plenty here remember what happened last time Apple changed their iPhone connector
And there are waaaay more iPhones out there now
I appreciate if anyone who interested and followed this news to help me understand the law
How can you decide the what will the universal charger
Share the percentage of market or its technology
How can you make sure that this one type of charger will help power high power laptop as well as lower powered laptop
Will this be overkill for low energy consuming laptop
Will/Can this law prevent companies doing design faults to make them buy their cable only
Apple will probably just include a USB-C to Lightning adapter in EU sales and call it complaint
Look at all of the happy Europeans here, not worried about Net Neutrality
Be more like Europe, America
*unzips*
The fifth and sixth pictures grabbed my attention
From what I understand, one looks like a shopping mall and the other is a home improvement retailer
It is more interesting to see that not only they are getting rid of billboards and signs found in private buildings and highways, they are also doing the same on the stores themselves
It feels like the country has a sign that reads ''This country uses product placement in its streets'' at the aiprort
\>  Street lights turn on at 5 PM when the sun is still up
Man same thing in Turkey
It's such a small thing but would make a great difference if every country did it properly
At least where I live half the street lights are broken and some streets are basically pitch black so it evens out a little at least
> United States of America
Pfff
Yes, that's idiotic
They should have driven cars everywhere and consumed as much as they could, right
What's idiotic about a striking protest to make your point very clearly
The responsibility doesn't fall to one country or region
I'm beginning to think it's too late and mankind doesn't have what it takes for unprecedented changes
Everyone around the world really needs to change their lifestyle so the world will have a chance
Otherwise the world is gonna give us some unprecedented changes soon
Unlike [this guy] they probably know what they're doing and are aware of the dangers
They are not gonna drop dead, don't worry
Moreover, even if they somehow died, they'd still deserve respect
It would be a very unfortunate way to go but they are not some YouTube pranksters, they would have died to protest with the hope of finding a solution for the most important problem the humanity has ever faced
Mamma mia grazie tante
She doesn't have a point, this is flat out populism
Ronaldo isn't paid by public organisations, unless she believes she lives in a country that is organised as a communist state, her argument is just invalid
Her standards of living has nothing to do with footballers' income
Ronaldo can say ''I pay at least 600 000 euros per month for that million I get, not my fault that you don't get a decent money''
Besides, is there a proper base amount of income to find a treatment
Like, if she was paid 10 000 a month, would she be responsible
Simple case of demand and supply
Football players earn that much because people keep wasting money on football
Stop watching football, don't buy apparel, stop betting
But it's not gonna happen
The masses need something to forget about their misery for a while
I dunno man seems like robbery to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I strongly believe nations such as GB or germany should give back these wonders to country of origins
at least with reperations
(the prices it took to uncover and carry these to their homeland)
I have visited british museum and was shocked to learn %15 of all museum is from turkish homeland and  % 8 was from greece
mouseleum of halicarnassus
which is an ancient world wonder was for example stolen from turkey illegaly
But turkey could not get it despite 30 years of justice seeking
Both turkey and greece have strong archeological museums
this is a value created in this lands it is not just to take it to distant locations for glory
it may be the best museum in the world but most of the items have been stolen
UK have tons of stolen artifacts around the world and should give them back
Step 1: steal shit
Step 2: "SHARING IS CARING
Although the situation is slightly different, the way Turkey and Hungary handled the artifact situation was pretty examplary I'd say
Turkey and Hungary renovated Ottoman remnants together, adding plaques that explain their significance and also other works by their architects/funders which are mostly in Turkish borders
More tourism revenue for Hungary, more advertising for Turkey's tourism/culture
Again, not exactly the same because those are mostly whole buildings and not smaller artifacts, but if both sides are willing there are always possible mutually beneficial solutions to be found
I'm a pretty tidy and careful person, so you wouldn't have a problem with it if I stormed a really messy guy's apartment, beat him and stole his shit because it'll be safer and last longer with me
Military artifacts have different traditions about them and Moldova never formally requested it afaik, but I'd personally argue it should be returned if requested as well
Looks cute
I hope turkey will have its second Female president after erdoğans wild ride
polls show he is to go
But I hope it will be a women
Women of  great positions are always giving courage to millions
Was sitting on this for a while eh
US bombs Iran to stone age
Millions of Iranian refugees go to Iraq / turkey / Pakistan (Iran has 4x population of Syria), with none of the countries having resources to take any
So, some (millions) go to EU
Far right surge in EU, potentially increasing anti-EU rhetoric
EU needs to do something to stop US from attacking Iran
I'd even say it's existential for EU
Suleimani was the most powerful military figure in Iran and declared as a war hero by the Islamists in 90s. Now they are talking about a retaliation(s) against this act
I despise Iran's current regime but I hope this doesn't drag my country to a series of battles(I think war has a very little chance to occur) since Erdogan likes to be seen powerful
I assume if this escalates, NATO will join due to its geography and situation that Turkey in Syria
Can America and Middle East do their fight on where it is not bordering to Turkey

LOL what's the point of acting like Trump is the only guy who wants war
Your country is a war machine
It has been like this since the day it was established
Trump is just the guy you have in this decade
You've had tens of those in the past
Most likely, you'll keep having them in the future as well
I don't blame average American citizen for what the US government is doing but please stop virtue signalling and singling others out because it looks kinda funny
This is your country
This is what it does
It fights wars, sells guns, makes money
It is relentless, is always hungry for blood, wants total domination and has great propaganda skills
Trump is an actor among many others
Blame the foundations of your country, not some random citizen who thought electing Trump could be a better choice

The child in the left made me laugh
If the bold green implies majority then this is easily the worst map I seen about this topic
This is highly inaccurate I can't believe how this map is allowed to be even posted in this day
Its completely random the green parts are not based on anything and overlap with lands we knew had kurdish or arabic minority
Someone looking at this mapn will think half of Turkey was majority Armenian
Fully ignores the Armenian minority that still exists in Turkish borders
Light green should be exist in good chunk of the eastern Turkey
Genocide is real but it doesn't excuse this blatant incorrect map
Point of genocide remembrance days is to remember the correct history and to take a stand against political revisionism it loses its point when we just lie in other direction
**Copy pasting the OC's description from source:**
I know it’s not the first map regarding the Armenian population before and after the Genocide
But I have decided to do an own map which is a little bit more detailed and better looking
It should be considered that the Armenian population at that time was divided between 3 Empires
The Persian Empire, the Ottoman empire and since 1828 the Russian Empire
I have used different sources for the different parts of the map at different time periods
Keep in mind that not all green dots represent an Armenian majority
They can represent an Armenian majority, as well as a significant or visible Armenian community (mostly in reference to the larger cities such as Kayseri, Tabriz, Halep or Adana which had, as a whole, a Muslim majority, but a visible Armenian city quarter or community
The light green color is representing the coherent Area
To let you understand how I have worked and which sources I have used:
**The historical part of the map**
For the Ottoman part of Armenia i have used [the work of Sevan nisanyan]
It’s in Turkish but I had a bit help with the translation
He has made a detailed map about Armenian geographical name changes and Armenian settlements in the 19th Century - the second map I have actually used for this map
The difference is that Armenian geographical name changes are places which were originally Armenian - probably in the ancient and early medieval times
But in the run of time, since the 11 century, several conquests, forced emigrations and the settlement of Muslim - Turkish & Kurdish nomads, has changed the demographic distribution
The Armenian population shifted to the south and westwards
For the Russian part I have used a [ethnic map of the 19th Century]
The Persian part was a bit difficult, because there are no much ethnical maps
I have used [this wikipedia article] which list Armenian churches in Iran
By my logics everywhere, where a Armenian church is, was most probably also a Armenian village or at least a Armenian community
I have put these locations [into my Map] and colored them
Most of these locations are in the Iranian province West Azerbaijan (not to confound with the Azerbaijani republic in the Caucasus)
West Azerbaijan (Iran) was in some time periods also a part of the Armenian kingdoms - part of the Armenian provinces Vaspurakan and Barska hayk (= Persian Armenia - in Armenian language)
But there are also some in Isfahan, which are located in central Iran because in 1604 many Armenians were deported by shah Abbas in view of his scorched earth strategy during the Persian-Ottoman wars in the 17th century
**The todays part of the map**
After the world war the Armenian community in turkey was nearly fully destroyed
the last remaining significant Armenian communities are in Istanbul
The village [Vakıflı] (in Hatay) is known as the last remaining Armenian village in Turkey
Because it was added to French-Syria after the world war and then given to Turkey again in 1939
There is also a village southward of it called Kessab
But its located in Syria in the immediate border to Turkey
I have used [this Wikipedia article] for Syria
In the northeast of Turkey (Rize province) there are 2 villages inhabitant by [Hemshin Armenians] \- Armenians who were Islamized in the 15th century and lost their connection to the Christian Armenian community
But I have not included them, because they have lost their connection to the Armenian community many centuries ago and identify themselves rather as Turks as Armenians
This is also why they were not considered as Armenians by the Ottoman government and stayed in their villages
There is an unknown number of krypto/hidden Armenians in the eastern provinces, who have converted to Islam and changed their identity to Kurds or Turks
The Armenian community in Nakhichevan (Azerbaijan) was expelled in the first world war as well
But there was still an Armenian community left in Karabakh/Artsakh, Ganja, Semaxka, as well as in Absheron
But after the Karabakh war in 1988 the Armenian community in Azerbaijan was expelled as well
With Exception of Nagorno Karabakh, which is de-facto separated from Azerbaijan but still internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan
It should be considered that before the Karabakh war there was an Azerbaijani community in Armenia as well
In the east side of Lake Sevan, parts of the Syunik province and Yerevan
But after the Karabakh war they were expelled as well
So for the republic of Armenia today, I have used this map of the [population density] Just a bit more colored
For Georgia i have used these 2 maps
The Persian part was again difficult, because there are no precise Datas
Or at least I have not found them
But during the Genocide there was Ottoman campaign in Persia
Many Armenians were expelled from Iranian Azerbaijan
And after the Islamic Revolution there was a huge emigration
**Some other maps which I have used as an orientation were these ones**
What a pity
One of the shameful marks on our history
It's even more shameful we have people denying it
They say shit like "they deserved it". Monsters some of these people, I tell you, monsters
They made the situation so bad, mods outright ban you in history subs if you even DISCUSS the genocide, like the numbers and "operations". Shame
Who wants to bet how long until this gets locked
strange timing, again /s
Let the downvotes come
This is a terrible map with little to no accuracy either in the 1915 or modern part of it
Yes its started 105 years ago
>the Kurdish who took over a bunch of land
Kurdish people have been living in Syria & ME for thousands of years
The Hamidian massacres mostly happened in Anatolia proper
It was a divide and conquer approach
Not to forget all the Turks who got killed during Enosis by Georgios Grivas in Cyprus too
We all have done bad things
But what Greece has done to Turkey outweights to what Turkey did
Like the invasion of Ismir and many more
There is even a hollywood movie featuring Russel Crowe about it called the Water Diviner
Please,Turkey doesn't want to join to EU anymore,I think all world has seen that how EU works,after Coronavirus Pandemic,your EU will collapse
I humbly disagree my friend
There are about 13-18 million kurdish people in Turkey, including my Math teacher
They used the source wrong the one about Turkey is a map of villages that had Armenian names and were changed later on in Turkification of Turkey its not a map of Armenian majority regions those villages could have any number of different ethnicities
Also many of those villages are small settlements thats why they are dots meanwhile OP's map gives the impression that bold green areas are majority Armenian
Its not suprising that you don't care about history one bit I cleared my post a bit more to prevent you people from acting like idiots towards me but guess I was not fast enough
Why would anyone with a brain bitch slap a race that isnt even minority in the country
Im not saying its ok to bitch slap them if they are minority but if you treat them equal in your country why would you treat them badly outside the borders
I dont know how much you know about Syrian civil war but Turkey sent its forces just to create a safe zone
There are already 6-8 million Syrians Turkey
In that safe zone there are at least 1
5 million Syrians

Politicians and media lies constantly about anything
There can't be reelections and re-referendums just because they did something they always do
It's the voters responsibility to weed out misinformation before making decisions
> in democracy it's not like you vote once and that's it
Neither it is voting repeatedly until the sheeple make the the choice you want
People talk big about democracy but in the end everyone hates democracy if it gets the result they don't want and love democracy if it gets the result they want
You can't even elections every week in case someone changes their mind
People need to take some responsibility for their actions, but it's easier to blame things on the system
What if UK has a referendum again and they decide to stay, but then never have a referendum on this topic ever again
Shouldn't UK have a "should we leave EU" referendum every 3 years because apparently that's what democracy is
> And no, misinforming the public and willingly lying are not ok things to do and again, referendums have been remade for less
Yeah lying is bad
So are earthquakes, death and stepping on a puddle of water with socks on

What's next

People from all over the world, please take your fucking vote seriously
> After the historic 2016 Brexit vote in Britain, a survey conducted within days of the initial vote suggested that a number of Britons (7% of those who voted Leave*) immediately regretted their vote to Leave and would vote to Remain, instead, if given the chance
Reasons given by some people were that they were trying to cast a protest vote and "didn't think it would actually count".

You know right, there's a difference between a prophet and a politician
Why
Prophets has to live in modesty for making their commune bigger
Politicians are the generally the opposit
Yes, you have that right
But doing it is also disrespect
So, i also have every right to call you insensitive a..hole
That's what 1
8 billion people believe
What's wrong with respecting that
Well, that's true
There 1000's of article that criticize Islam
We're not against it
Drawing a prophet is already seen as disrespect at İslam
But mocking him with drawing
You can see why we see it as disrespect
Also
>Same with people who believes there's a magic skydaddy who thinks it's wrong to masturbate or that women are of less worth than men
That's not what Muslims believes
Majority is not salafi
Does it matter
>Mocking with a drawing is fucking harmless
Noone says it hurts
We're saying it's disrespect to our believes
Just because something is harmless doesn't mean it's respectful
>Islamic states do treat women less, stop pretending they're not
Yeah, the salafi ones do that
I'm assuming you've never heard Bektashi sect or Anatolian İslam in general
Ignorance is cureable you know

There is two versions of Europe:

Turkey isn’t in Europe, though

ugh

According to Europe,Turkey isn't a European country
So,why is Turkey here ?

Would not change the result
Radical secularism of Turkish institutions then would still hold true which would result in  support for AKP in public still because they still would have the “abused by power” narrative that Turks love to root for
Getting sick of coalitions in public and also for foreign investors would also still hold true and AKP would still commit to neo-liberal project of the west and would still get that financial support from the west
Those are much bigger factors for AKP’s 2002 election win than the 2001 crisis
Hell, there is not even a narrative like “AKP fixed 2001 crisis” in Turkey, people talk about and give that credit to Kemal Derviş and say AKP continued his economic policies
Of course the latter point is/was a praise of AKP within neoliberal and liberal circles both within Turkey and foreigners but never given them the lion share of credit
Watched them getting called terrorists and being sent to prisons literally made for them live on tv
I disagree, first even if one more party joined the parliament AKP wouldn't have a majority and secularist parties would have feared a second "28 February Incident" not to mention there were many DSP and ANAP and other such party supporters voting AKP for purely economic reasons which would take away votes from AKP and likely would put DYP,ANAP and MHP over the threshold
How would getting sick of coalitions make people vote for AKP exactly
And their neoliberal policies were held by ANAP aswell
It might not be AKP fixed the 2001 crisis but it is the narrative that they made the economy grow, which was mostly thanks to the pre-AKP reforms under the DSP-MHP-ANAP government, the economic boom Turkey experienced would have happened largely under the DSP-ANAP-MHP governemnt if the election had taken palce in 2004
I am not saying they wouldn't be large party, I would expect them to be the main oppositiin but they wouldn't able to ride the wave of the economic boom
I guess our main disagreement comes from:
a) I think centre right voters voting for AKP mainly happened because of the support of western neoliberal investors so it’d have happened regardless because I believe they would not support a coalition like that as they were looking for political stability
b) ANAP was dying anyway to me and even though they had the same neoliberal policies, their party was not going to start inspiring confidence again in both their voters who switched to AKP and also foreign investors no matter what
The root of my thinking of this is mostly due to “Derviş fixed 2001” narrative
You also say AKP does not have that narrative
Yeah, they have the narrative of economic growth but that narrative took place *after* 2004 imo and hence that coalition would not have the narrative of them fixing 2001 like AKP does not have it
The other root of it is that I think foreign investors were done with coalitions and passionately rooted for political stability even if your argument with regards to public opinion changing with election being in 2004 and them seeing economy being fixed during coalition government and switching to supporting them is valid
You can't break that cycle because it's the essence of nations
There will always be nations hating each other for what their grand-grand-grand-whatever parents did to each other, those nations wouldn't exist without that hatred

Why America's presidential election system is not based on popular votes
I thought Trump was losing in 2016 because I didn't fully know America's electoral system that time
Getting millions less votes than your rival and being elected as president seems wrong to me
Biden got 4 million more votes, but in some states if around 20 thousand people voted differently, Trump would be president again thanks to electoral college
This is weird
After the Trump i hope they don't start randomly bombing the Middle East again
Sorry but we are too full to get more refugees
Dear Americans if you again have intentions to bomb middle east, aftermath please take the refugees to your country
Don't put another economic burden on your dear poor nato ally
I hope this election will be good for World Politics
Probably most of us saw that coming from miles away
right
As a pro eurasian I'm happy, With this election Turkey will be able to leave Nato and make an alliance with Russia and China
If we do this we can prevail all region
yep literally the biggest reason i was hoping he would win
i hope he can do good even without the senate
Yeah buddy we're expecting sanctions, too
And probably start a new war in some 3rd world country and cause another migrant wave
He IS the senate
Why tho
Trump was better than let's say Bush or Obama
No new wars
And more pressure to China
Although there are 50 states in America, elections seem to be lead by only 9-10 states
Presidential candidates only really concentrate at these swing-states
Doesn't seem right to me
Actually I'm not a pro eurasian
I only wanted to see European people response when I wrote this
And I have seen that lots of European redditors have mental problem, because If I had said that I'm pro EU intstead of I'm pro eurasia, people would have downvoted me again
You are right but, you are wrong too
I know, Turkey isn't a super super super power but, Turkey is one of the big powers in mediterranean and middle east
Turkey's military power is strong and also Turkey has military bases over 10 countries in these areas and with military power Turkey has influence on these countries
Yes, Russia and China isn't ally but, they are close to eachother and Turkey has strategical location for Russia and China
Turkey is important for Russia because of straits and mediterranean and Turkey is important for China because of Economic
That's what we're hoping
Though Biden might make our lives considerably harder, the problem starts at the top of our own country and that's exactly what needs to change
he can still do plenty with executive orders though right
and in any case democrats would better win the the reruns in georgia this january
You say that like it's impossible
Only thing Islamists hate is other Islamists
Obama had no a good record on that for comparison
His actions in middle east was far more severe than even Bush could accomplish
Sry but Trump being anti-war was much more preferable and Democrats are not reliable on this issue
Let's see which random country will Biden bomb

Why no Turkey
where tf is turkey
All of Europe is just a giant forest
So Turkey is not European
The UK blows my mind because it feels like we have so many trees
I think I've seen on these things that Turkey has more forest cover than UK
I suppose it's just that at a micro-level, the parts of UK I live in have a higher than average forest cover and the parts of Turkey I go to have lower than average forest cover
sweden nice
Imagine being assigned to protect some rainbow chalk

Norilsk not Europe
It's ministry, so it is a govertnment institution
You must obey the protocols when hiring for government
In free market, nobody cares who you are hiring
Look at all those female majority, white majority or black majority companies
It's not against the law
You can hire a street vendor instead of a MBA graduate for your companies CEO position
But when it's for government there should be some rules
For example; today in my country(Turkey) daughter of the state council member appointed to very high position as a "judge" at her first day at the job
Ironically, these people are graduated from law school and gonna bring justice to this country
No, it was never like that
It is true that there was only one election to elect the president and the vice president, in which the candidate that received the highest number of votes would become the president and the one that received the second highest would be the vice president
However, electors used to cast two votes
One of the electors would be given the task to vote for the president and not to vote for its running mate
By design the difference in electoral college cannot be less than 6, if it is not tied, so the opposition candidate had no chance of winning the presidency/vice presidency
Rest in peace my buddy
This sub is much more far right than European average though
Just check threads about immigration and then actual numbers in polls about immigration in Europe
Since mid-2000's far right is on an internet crusade, anywhere they aren't kicked out of they will eventually end up controlling because regular people don't want to deal with their bs and leave whereas your average neonazi has nothing better to do than pissing people off online
Mods let them have their fun, sub ended up here
If it was deliberate or just a misguided attempt to communicate and uphold free speech, that's a question for the mods
Idk, there are plenty of German fascists here as well
The "right wing" here on this sub doesn't really look like regular European right either, it's more like fringe neonazis than traditional conservatives
My best friends are studying in Munich and I visit them often so I can say with some confidence I know what a conservative right wing German looks/thinks/speaks like
Met the kind of "right wing" types you see here once or twice max irl
Judging by this sub alone one would think 1/3 of all Germans were a bit to the right of AfD lol
Sure, how can you know someone's political alignment from a contemporary political discussion right
Maybe the guy that thinks immigrant boats in the Mediterreanean should be sunk is a leftist, who knows
If the "strict immigration" here refers to drowning refugees, yes, it is a far right position
an accident, terror attack or something to do with gilets jaunes
Why are they downvıting you isnt this a legit question
As a turk that join gezi this peaceful protest are useless
You merely adopted the shame
Governments should disincentivize being anti-vaxx
I mean we shouldn't purge them all and we should give them the opportunity to be anti-vax but it should come with a great cost for them
75-80% vaccination in a society is sufficient to protect the country
Uhh
Looks like someone was really proud of his/her kid's drawing
Brilliant
So many protests everywhere
Thanks
Dude, that was 4 years ago
Erdogan used that coup to full extend and become defacto dictator of the country
Fire of Reichstag kind of shit but this time someone really started the fire
Bro I literally made the same joke today FUCK
> my 13 year old ass
You're still only a baby now lmao
Man I'm old af
"We are now at a point where words end in the fight against terrorism
We are now at a stage where this should be put at the forefront,"
Erdogan also said this he had some decency back then
One simple question; was attacking and killing isis members an oppression and ethnic cleansing against Arabs
If no, i beg for someone to explain to me why is it for Kurds in case of another acknowledged terrorist organization which i lost friends to their attacks
Open the border
My first comment on reddit, been here more than 1 year indeed, just haven't posted nothing
It's difficult to see any hatred word or insult by Turks to the 'Kurds' (not terror groups) since the operation has begun, unless we are insulted
All we do is expressing ourselves and trying to explain the need and necessity of this operation as citizens of a country which has been target of terror attacks countless times, lost thousands of lifes, fought against terrorism for decades, which borders on Syria and Iraq
And against all those sensible reasons, what we get from other countries is just nonsense false claims and accusations like ethnic-cleansing, Kurdish genocide etc
Just nonsense
Those MPs shown in the image are the member of a party which has close ties to the terrorist group PKK (which recognised as a terrorist group by EU,US,NATO)  and its Syrian affiliate YPG
So that's quite normal for police officers to prevent them from making a provocative speech which will explicitly or implicitly praise terrorist groups
Anyways, explanation of this image is that simple
So I want to move on
As I said at the beginning we are trying to explain our situation logically, as best as we can
While getting accusations from other countries, we're getting many things worse than accusation from the people, hateful words, insults, blames, racism
Absolute impudence and disrespect in brief
I'm always fully careful on the words I say and on the sentences I make, to avoid to seem like someone how you anti-turks want me to seem as
And when it comes to talk about Turks, Turkey, our ancestors and our history everybody feels free to say whatever the fuck they like
You keep trying to defame our history with your rotten arguments
You think you can be racist against Turks as you blame Turks for being racist and fascist
You don't even want to see the vandalism and wildness under the name of protests in your countries
Turks are getting attacked and injured by PKK supporters and Kurds only because they are Turks but what all you peace-lovers do is turning a blind eye to this cruelty, neither condemning nor saying anything about it
You think that any Turk on earth deserve to get killed and beaten because the Turks are blood-thirsty barbarians right ? Is this because you've been educated with the one-sighted genocide, war crime stories which made up by propaganda lobbies and never ever given a thought to search the history, facts, to see any truth
Or you Europeans just like having animosity towards Turks
That makes more sense, and better than believing in empty baseless lies
Because there must be some fucking reasons to ignore the reality of a terrorist group right
This is not only Kurds who treated like this, people are treated like this in Turkey
All you need to do is search the news before pointing one face of the coin to accuse something
[This is the democracy Kurds face in Germany
Civilians and journalists have been attacked by Hundred of German Police to leave the area when they were trying to make statement
It might be to protect them tho
Its not just erdoğan
Many secular turks are also this anti-democratic
It works well for erdoğan as he easily tames opposition by using hate against kurds
As a Turk, I confirm this
They support Erdoğan blindly but have no idea on what the fuck is up here
I'm pro-opposition but all i'm seeing is Erdoğan farming voters left and right
I think one of the main things uniting Turks is the Europeans reaction especially, Americans too but the Turkish-US relations went to shit years ago
I try to keep an open mind but it seems like in general we're either portrayed as barbarians who want to genocide every Kurd in the world and drink their blood or we're portrayed as the nazis 2
Trkey was always this way towards kurds, in fact even worse
If you keep supporting terrorists Erdogan never gonna fall, that's how he gets his power from his base
Lol
Ehh who cares about what Turks say anyway
literally *all of them* are brainwashed
What do you know about Turkish political system, especially HDP and its members, if I may ask
Yes they are
How are we doing a genocide if we have 20M Kurds in the country
It's only common with most Erdogan supporters (who make up less than half the country)
Yep, because of the tensions between radical secularists and politically Islamists, political oppression in different forms always happened basically
Also some marxist-leninist movements too for a few decades
Like, radical secular tradition of Turkish politics is really radical and well, political Islamists are political Islamists
But those were mostly between different fractions of power and never had an autocracy like this or long years of power like this from a politically Islamist politician
My point was it is easy to change the words or doesn’t show other side of the story
Every protest is treated like this in Turkey
Nothing particularly against Kurds
It's by no means a surprise that countries are condeming us, I saw it coming but I didn't expect to see such a reaction from European citizens and media
Sometimes it almost seems like i'm reading The Onion
I was expecting the media to explain the differences between Rojava, Iraqi Kurdistan (whom Turkey helped build and support) but they simple seem to label them as "kurds".
From what i've seen some people have a hard time differentiating between Turks supporting the army and Turks supporting Erdoğan which is understandable because Erdoğan makes it seem like he's the one risking his life on the ground
Thank you, but by you I meant West
They shouldn't have been in the parliement in the first place
These "politicians" open up Abdullah Öcalan(founder of PKK) flags and PKK(internationally recognized terrorist organization) flags on their rallies
I mean
it's a fucking mess
Kurdish mothers gather up in front of their buildings and ask their sons back from mountains, they force Kurdish children to be terrorists, so these politicians are basically terrorists in suits
Then give me numbers, if there is a genocide show me how many have been "cleansed", how many have been killed
Edit: I see, only downvotes but no answer
I didn't know i was the entire turkish government and I don't follow erdoğan endorsed news
I see no genocide other than people saying genocide, either provide a solid proof or shut up
Civillian casulties in this 11 days of operation is so far 120, what a lousy genocide my forefathers rolling in their graves
Wow i didn't know dutches did an arab genocide
Before you say the obligatory wHaTaBoUtIsM, this is to point out your hypocrisy
I like how your entire argument is my argument is flawed
11 day going on operation with 120 civillian death is genocide
Single airstrike with 70 civillian death is not genocide
And its not a completely unrelated war
Champ de Mars
Me neither

True story
You do realize the entire europe saw many wars and occupations, right
If western europe could get back up after WW2 which was only decades ago, maybe stop blaming the ottoman empire for your problems that collapsed a century ago
It ended a CENTURY ago
Long before all of you were born
This is a new world and has been so for years
I say the same thing when people blame WWI for Turkey’s problems
If other countries got back on their feet and/or did better and not you, stop talking about second and third parties and focus on what YOU have been doing wrong
This entire region is master of whining and accusing others instead of taking responsibility and discussing solutions
P.S. WW2 was extremely destructive financially
Its affect lasted for years
P.P.S.  The assumption the Balkans would do better without the Ottoman occupation is nothing but an assumption
Good guys vs
bad guys
Geologically Anatolia is very new
It used to be a sea
There was also a landmass where the Aegean is
Anatolia rose and Aegean sank
There is a lake called 'Tuz Gölü', which means Salt Lake which a left over from that era
Creating a bosphorus from Black Sea to Arctic Sea would solve the issue
At geography like that it kinda becomes meaningless if a country's European or not
Armenia is just Caucasian, which some could call an extension of Europe
As for Turkey, the European and Asian parts aren't even noticably different
It's kind of a useless thing to debate about
Hot take: Anything to the east of Czechia doesn't qualify as core Europe
It was a horrible attack on secular values
A big left-wing Turkish newspaper tried to print their Muhammed cartoons in solidarity with French but they were raided by police
Imagine actually thinking human life matters lul
Some people I talked to in the streets legit said “they deserved it” about the Hebdo attacks
I’d like to assume that only a fringe minority thinks that, but my experience tells me otherwise
You guys could not begin to comprehend how most Muslims are
If I criticised Mohammad in a public space, I think I’d get beaten to near death by almost everybody in a 10 meter radius
Worst part is, Turkey is THE most secular and moderate Muslim country
People get capital punishment for this in others
in their mind it was jihad, so legitimate by Islam
Im an ex muslim and you are bullshitting people
Eh, Cumhuriyet is one of the more journalistic newspapers
They’re centre left and very concerned about the de-secularisation of Turkey, hence your perceived islamophobia
But keep in mind that Muslims read that newspaper
Also, any Middle Eastern newspaper will shit on Israel, that’s just a given
Israel killed Turkish charity workers on an aid ship, we’re still bitter about that haha
I really can not understand American neo-nazis
Their grandfathers fought against Nazis, were killed by them and they symphatise them
damn dude lol
Politicians should be as well fed as the most malnourished citizen in their country
One drone to rule them all
I find it cute when Americans learn about Centerism and how the Democrats are not actually on the Left
Also how when they find out that everything on the left is not Socialism
'A lot' is superior to a locked number that is now a ratio of 1:750,000
America has two upper houses
And when I look at USA all I see is "centre-right versus right".
Good luck passing a law
I disagree, such parliament is just one big distraction and an illusion of democracy
With two big parties, it boils down all the bullshit filler and single-issue parties into two choices
Much more efficient
Either way its hard to get everyone to agree with each other, but that's democracy
Still, It's easier and more efficient than getting 10 parties to agree with each other
American system is able to do more big changes easily than the European one
It is completely ridiculous to compare the European system to the American one, they operate completely different and a different constitution also states have less autonomy than in the EU
My saying is that the EU would be much more efficient if there were only 2 parties
What's up with Bursa having that single highest live on the map
Wow, Turkey is really empty
And here our president who believes building presidential palaces improve the international standing
Yeah but when the same person wants to fund corono aid through donations there is no point

nothing at all

What you can get here with 12

In Turkey, 8 euros will get you around 8 mbps download and 0

You get 100mb for twice that in Turkey

Good job Greece
I hope I can see the day when MHP is treated as such in Turkey but yeah I am not holding my breath
Great job neighbours, congratulations
It's really interesting how much we share in common with Greece
Turkey followed a similar path of military interventions and far-right extremism supplanted by religious fundamentalist notions and historic/cultural revisionism
And these happened in NATO member countries under strict oversight of USA, UK and rest of NATO/Europe
They simply didn't care the values of democracy, liberty and equality getting abandoned just so they can use us all as buffer states against "communism" and USSR
Sadly, while Greeks punished their generals, we ended up glorifying them, their collaborators and successors run the country now
Glory To The Red Army

How much money are airlines losing over this
Are they going to hugely increase the prices in the summer now
I wonder why they didn't wait for 2 more days to post it
Anti fascists are the real fascists guys
This is so fucking wrong, USSR is the country that stopped the Nazis
What
I didnt claim that
Can you even read
USSR was preparing for the war against Nazis from the start, it is dumb to think they are somehow equal or allies
And that guy is right that capitalist were appeasing Nazis
It is recorded history
The only surprise was that Nazis attacked earlier than they thought
It was a known public opinion in both countries that they were each others biggest enemies
read the preparations part
Edgy 14 year olds: communism is great
We declared this day some anti-communist day because Britain and France didn't make an agreement with USSR so that anti-communist Nazi Germany and communist USSR would fight each other to death and then western capitalists would just exploit them afterwards but it didn't go as planned and USSR decided to fight Nazi Germany after getting stronger and made a deal to not get attacked in the meantime so that's why we treat them like allies because why not lolz
Btw never question why Britain literally gave Czechoslovakia to Hitler, we clearly are not allies of Nazis as those communists
I think this was what you meant
There's a few reasons, one being what Capitalism has done to my country
In an effort to combat Communist groups in the South-East, (who everyone calls Kurds(but there were significant ammounts of Turks as well))  the CIA funded far-right winged terrorism (The Grey Wolves and Alparslan Türkeş) who killed left-winged students or activists who wanted to stop the USA from putting ships in the Bosporus
I know people who lost relatives to them
This and a few other things make it very difficult for me ti support Capitalism

I don't know if I am picking those because they're more familiar to me, but it looks like it is based on the Turkish one and others added onto it

I disagree it's required to be clarified
Everybody understand third world countries with poor healthcare but not everybody will realize being in US when there is a global pandemic is a big risk
The idea that you are fucked if you get sick in US as a non-citizen with no insurance is not something a lot of people from Europe realize
You overestimate the knowledge of random young adult who has never worried about this before

Uh no almost nobody denies it btw
Its just all turks are together when foreigners says it
If I a Turk go and say to a Turk he will most likely not deny it cuz its true ffs
But the numbers are wrong its not 1

It is interesting, that you can visit Turkey to chill
Anything above 25 degrees is too much for me

You can hate radical islam all you want, Europeans did this to themselves
Either not let them in, not let them radicalized or dont trigger them
It's like you have a bees nest in your home that you try to live with them

The Qur'an clearly says "don't kill any human being, if you do, you will go to hell

Turkish language doesn't have gendered pronouns too
Same in Turkish
I think Google has an option to translate for both genders for languages like Hungarian, Finnish, Turkish etc
This above picture happens if that feature is disabled
Same in turkish, we have "O"
Detroit Become Human
Same in Turkish
"O gitti" means "He/She/It went" . Google Translate haves bad time when it try to translate gender neutral things
Same in Turkish, "o" means he, she and it
In Turkish, "O" means he/she/it, same goes for Hungarian too I suppose
It is too crazy that two tribes moved to Europe 500 years apart and kept similarities between the languages
Edit: Google Translate just picks a gender if you try this in Turkish, results will be "He is beautiful
He is clever
He reads
He sews
etc".
Nice
Non gender language stronk
I thought only Turkish had this
Thank you for enlightmenting
The pronoun in Turkish is also "O".

Thank god in Turkey there are heavily anti-government and leftist newspapers still operating in Turkey like sözcü and cumhuriyet
Wait, what's with that Soros guy
Erdogan and his party also like to blame him in every opportunity
Ahahahah in Turkey it's totally the opposite
> I wonder if people would react differently if it was a 'fuck all (insert random minority)' sticker
Would people react differently if a person from an ethnic majority group (that has the priviledge and power than entails) makes a racist commentary towards minorities (who have disadvantages and disenfranchisement that entails)
Compared with the subject of this article which is a citizen (little guy, no power) making a commentary on authority figures (powerful figures)

We have state owned propaganda machines in our TVs 24/7 too, I can understand you to my bones

Iskender kebap, on the other hand, is the best way to eat doner by far
I strongly recommend, but it should be done properly
It is not something the average kebap shop at the corner of your street can do

What am I supposed to do with this information
I have never heard of this event until now
This is incredibly sad holy fuck
I wish we could all just get along
What is the story behind it
That's 8

I'm so fucking sick and tired of right wing governments everywhere enough bruuh enough pls
My question would be; Is the West Poland more or less liberal than East Germany
cool shitpost
Is the weather always like that there
Looks miserable
EDIT: Let me detail
This fog is very nice if it's less than 15-20 days a year or smth, but if it's more it's bad
looks similar to ireland a bit

Turkish version "Fransiz kalmak/I am French to the conversation" does not imply the "French Language". It basicly express that " I am foreigner to this conversation like a Frenchman"
So it is not about the conversation/language is not understood because it sounds like "French" but conversation is not understood because the listener is a "French".
I do not know why we use this expression
I do not think it is incapability of French people of understanding conversations in particular, but maybe because we are speaking Turkish and a Frenchman couldn't understand a Turkish conversation
Why Frenchman
Je ne sais pas
Can someone explain what's going on here
"It's no data"
Why is there a Chinese 爱 character there
I use all of them
is it normal
We say "Konuya Fransız kaldım" which means "I didn't understand/know the conversation". Also why everyone hates us lol
Iki tane durum var bu deyimin kullanilabilecegi;
1) ornegin iki tane arkadas gecen seneki tatillerindeki komik bir olay hakkinda konusuyorlar
Ucuncu bir arkadaslari geliyor yanlarina ama o ucuncu kisi tatile gitmemis onlarla
Bu iki arkadas konusurken ucuncusu ne hakkinda konustuklarini anlamiyor
Arkadaslari da ona "Sen bu konuya fransiz kaldin" diyor
Cunku, konustuklari konu ile ilgili hic bir sey bilmiyor bu ucuncu kisi
&#x200B;
2) Ornegin, iki tane muhendis bir proje hakkinda konusuyorlar
Yanlarina bir ucuncu kisi geliyor ve bu kisi bir bankaci
Bu iki muhendis proje hakkinda cok fazla teknik terim kullaniyorlar
Bankaci olan kisi de "Ben konustuklariniza Fransiz kaldim" diyor cunku onlarin konustugu teknik terimleri bilmiyor
The context is a famous poet goes to live in France for several years
When he returns to Turkey, he cannot understand what his other poet friends are talking about
His friends tell him "You are French to this topic
" So it is neither about language nor nationality but still interesting imo
I would put my penny to the theory that expression is rooted from old times, where a  westerner is equal to the French, and hence all foreigners are basically French
So a westerner wouldn't understand our language or even a westener speaks Turkish, still wouldn't understand the specific/complicated expressions/conversations
So a foreigner is most probably a westerner
A westerner is same same a French
Probably that is the reason
Taking into consideration that, European influence in Ottoman and Turkish times are mostly via French language
For example, gonorrhea is also called "French Disease/ Tur
Frengi" in Turkish, but not just because of is considered "French" but because it is considered "European/westerner etc". So roughly European=French
Well , Turkey is not getting along with too many countries and France is not the one with worst relations
It’s just an idiom
Highly possible
Its look like anor londo from dark souls rigth

How is this related to Europe
Same thing happened in Turkey/Antalya, they put bike lanes going towards and on the sidelines of the coast, after a year of cars not caring about the bike lane and the ones that do, reporting to the government that they dont want bike lanes, the bike lanes have been removed
I cannot read it but it is probably legal to be used as a parking some hours per day

When I visited the UK I first went to London and a year later I went to Edinburgh and I think London doesn’t stand a chance compared to Edinburgh
I mean Edinburgh has such a refined beauty
Architecturally it is just fascinating and has something the metropolitans and the common tourist destinations like london, paris, venice, istanbul don’t.
I fucking love Scotland, man
My type of country
beautiful city
As far as I know buildings in Edinburgh was made from light sand stone and then they got darker because of the industrial revolution
And I think the main problem when it comes to istanbul is that we had a similar antipariochi like the Greeks did in the 70s so Istanbul’s architectural and historical sites are concentrated in particular zones and there are really ugly neighborhoods in the outer city while in Edinburgh most if the buildings were protected and even the most common building keep up to the architectural standards
Nice read, thanks
Again, I am simply a tourist who visited the two cities
FOR A TOURIST I found Edinburgh more impressive
It’s not an absolute verdict I don’t know how to live like in these cities
I simply think I would rather go to Edinburgh than to London if I visit the UK again
Thanks for the advice
I  really want to visit Glasgow when this whole corona business ends

You can say whatever you want
Which is causing reaction from the Turks (as they are already paranoid about everything)
This subject will never be resolved as long as both sides keep their current mentality
Thank you :)
That's the problem, "deniers" says that there is no historical fact that Armenians were **systematically** killed, which is the definition of genocide

I hate Çamlıca Mosque but good photo
sadly there will be a massive earthquake on istanbul next 30 years
Well done you have captured the ugliest mosque in the whole city
I still laugh they went to capadocia with ships
Well actually it was commonly called İstanbul for hundreds of years
And both names are Greek
It’s just that legally the name changes in like 1928 or something
And post office stopped delivering mail to “Constantinople” at that time
Greeks you know probably aren't jerking off to the Byzantine empire and the Megali Idea
The one in Dark Souls 3
How so
The place where the guy stands and the place we look at in the photo both are not in Constantinople
They are up north and were inside the borders of Ottoman Empire before 1453
Cope
It is not Hagia Sophia lol
It is Çamlıca Mosque which was built in 2017
Ah yes, the absolute best part about Istanbul, the many, many adorable cats just roaming around
Truly a paradise for cat people
It's not a huge feat to build such structures any more
The photo is cool but the mosque was an unnecessary project, built by spending millions of dollars
No reason for it other than fulfilling Erdogan's power fantasy, and I'm pretty sure he wants it to be his tomb
because its architecture was copied from Hagia Sophia and the Sultanahmet
(even though it was built in 2017)
You mean this one
Well, I never thought it as a mosque, but they indeed look similar
&#x200B;
Now that we are at it, I have a question for you, something that I have been curious about
Do the mosques (or churches), or in general the architecture and cities of Europe and the Mediterranean basin (i.e. Arab countries) seem exotic and alien to you
Because for me, Chinese (and in general East Asian) buildings, palaces, temples, cities (the historical parts of them) etc
look so different and exotic, even alien, as if it was from a different planet
I wondered whether a Chinese person share the same impression, but in a opposite way
The mosque is the orange dot in [the pic] It was an Ottoman territory century before Constantinople fell
Constantinople is simply Fatih district of current Istanbul
Its population was roughly 40
000 back then
That they built that one is annoying, but I think the end result is going to be pretty nice to be honest, and that one has a way cooler and somewhat more unique design than the camlica mosque
Meh
Not only this mega mosque (that has a capacity of 63k people and never gets full) but also other "iconic" mosques like the one in Taksim Square could have much more modern&contemporary architecture like [this]
But because of Erdogan's Ottoman fetish and need to show off we just poured down millions to this huge concrete replica of medieval mosques in 2017 that has no architectural innovation
Thanks for your input
Well the Hagia Sophia is originally a Greek building, so it IS just as European as the Gothic architecture
Nevertheless I get what you are trying to say
But does the Western European architecture feel unfamiliar or exotic to Chinese, just as the Byzantine or Ottoman architecture does, or does it seem familiar (you seem to imply it does but perhaps I misunderstand)
After all Classical China and Catholic Europe are very different originally
It is a nice thing that they visit
Cultural exchange can only bring positives
I would like to visit China also, sometime
For me, if it wasn’t included with the ridiculous rules of “no bar etc within 300m or whatever, I’d have zero issues
But because of that I lament the addition of more camis, especially in parts of the city that are already full of camis, but at the same time I’m a big fan of beautiful buildings, which are few and far between in İstanbul
I don’t hate our vernacular architecture
I quite like it, but a beautiful building here and there is quite nice
That proposal for Taksim Mosque later was improved to [this] It had suras from Quran carved on its dome and the shadow of the script would fall down on prayers
It would look mystic and gorgeous, tbh and even I (I am not a believer) would be in awe of the beauty of the mosque
Yes, creating a concrete replica of a 15th century mosque implies "we could not develop a new architectural style in the last five centuries and just are nostalgic about it". Sorry I am not really a fan of the Ottoman fetish
Even a replica of Ortaköy mosque would look more modern
If that means you put semen in his coffee he's going to tell on you to Mutti, you guys

I believe he refers to Mahmud, not "Mehmedites"
Easy

Isn't it funny though
Modern day Turkey founded after the Greco-Turkish war, which was a defensive war by Turks against mainland Greeks
So there is some history to it
But present day conflicts arise from disputes on islands
Greek Islands are all over the Aegan sea, some are as close as a few miles to Turkish mainland
And of course there is Cyprus
I don't know why everyone acts like they are an ambassador for their country though
Its just obvious that people just downvoted you because you are turkish I just can’t understand some people

As a Turk, the fact that people in Europe stand up in the metro even though there are seats is so weird to me
We LOVE sitting
Man if Erdogan ever did that
As I've said, we love sitting

(Unless it's a small city and it's only gonna take 5 mins, then it's pointless to sit)

Even 4chan got blocked REEEEEEEEEEE
Honestly I have no idea how reddit is still open in Turkey since considering how much Erdogan bashing happens here I would have expected it to be one of the first sites that they would block
At least he didn't sell our internet rights to some cable company
I believe our internet will turn to normal when this guy is gone
To be clear once and for all
You are all wrong about one thing
Turkey is neither European nor Asian
TURKEY IS AFRICAN
i can't even open the image without vpn
It's the Islamist stache
Since Islamist AKP scum rules Turkey, everyone holding a political office has the Islamist stache
[Here you can identify social class and political inclination with staches]
We call it a "badem bıyık", or "almond-stache". Almost exclusive to the AKP and their people, including the Gülenists
They may have split, but the 'stache remains the same
It’s because %100 of all ministers are AKP sided and they are all hunks
Hahaha it's kind of mandatory
According to the rumors, which we have no idea if it's true or not, Erdoğan wants people to have a mustache
According to the same rumor it started as a joke but then became real
I mean it's really stupid so it's likely true
image hosts aren't. imgur and i.redd
it are both banned
Strangely enough I can still access 4chan and pretty much everything else from Bilkent (My University), except for Wikipedia which I need a vpn for
So I guess Wikipedia was blocked "specially" or something
Anyways Wikizero is a thing so no biggie
Not to sound elitist or anything, but politicians in Turkey are on the same intellectual level as taxi drivers and janitors
Erdogan didn't go to University, the current PM does not even know how the internet works
Most of the officials went to religious schools and rose to power via connections
There are a few scholarly ones, like Ahmet Davutoglu who has a PhD in Economics and Political Science, but they all got purged because they tried to run the government properly with principles
> He looks like the type of guy that talks about immorality and how people have no manners only to go home and beat his wife
This is exactly what most AKP politicians and hardcore supports are like
Why though
This is not the European Union subreddit as far as I'm concerned
Am moustache, can confirm
I ended up growing into a fully fledged Turk
It doesn’t really matter since all they do is to listen to the big president and do what he says
i.redd
it works for me though I don't think it is banned because that would even make less of a sense since reddit isn't.
Yes but in Turkey full beards are not seen appropriate in government positions or any high-ranking position really
I don't see how looking like a caveman makes you more pious
I can't access i.redd
it for the last 4-5 days
Among ALLLL the sites you can ban why imgur and reddit's own image hosting site
It's like my own government fucking teasing me deliberately
it doesn't work for me

This doesn't matter much on Reddit (since you can still click on the small "display image" button on posts to see the full images, though this is inconsisten from ISP to ISP, but even then you can consistently see images if you

How dare my favorite medieval empire get defeated by another medieval empire, surely this must reflect on my opinion on internet arguments
1453 best year of my life
Where you from
i never saw someone calling the Byzantines as Romans
edit:ah the brigading
The term "Byzantine" is a product of modern historiography
The Byzantines, rather, the Eastern Romans, always referred to themselves as "Romans", the emperors referring to themselves as "Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans" by the end, that is, 1453
The West would call them "Emperor of the Greeks" to delegitimise the Byzantine claim on being the "rightful" successor to the Roman Empire, as they supported the legitimacy of the Holy Roman Empire
Correct, I was a college student when that happened
also it’s Conquest of Constantinople considering the city got better under Ottoman rule
you may think im giving a biased answer but it really has historical merit to it
Ottoman Sultan of the time Fatih took the Conqueror title after the battle since Constantinople was considered unbreachable for many years, and Fatih tried to keep the city unharmed as much as he could
A common misconception is that city lost its spirit after Ottoman conquest but it was still named Konstantiniyye,all the Greeks and non muslims were allowed to stay and take on Ottoman citizenship,and throughout the Ottoman dynasty city was valued and kept as the most advanced city title for many years
So i really don’t see the point of calling it as « fall of Constantinople » as in « fall of Rome ».City didn’t befall to Barbarians who sacked it

People would say "he still has around %40-45 percent support (among 100 voters, turnout is around 85-90 so you make the math)" but you should remember that the whole GOVERNMENT of Turkey is basically a propaganda machine right now
He doesn't rule and advertise it to the people, he rules by advertising

This video is full of Bullshit
Two factors to consider here: propaganda and polarisation
Erdogan uses to his polarizing rhetoric through all the propaganda channels to divide the people
This way, he managed to get the votes of centrist spineless bigots
This doesn't mean all of his voters are die-hard supporters of him
He uses fear and hatred to attract those bastards
Fortunately/unfortunately, as the economy gets worse, those dumbfucks change their minds
That's why we can't talk about democracy without a proper media and freedom of speech
Why dont you post the [las held elections] Even If it was for mucipalities, it showed a thing or two
You think we actually vote for him
He always rigs the elections, if he were to lose he just says that the opposition cheated and makes another election
Niye downgote atmışlar
Haklısın. Bizim millet akıllanmaz
Some of the voters voted more than one and they burned some votes  (at least i think) but yeah hope he will be gone
Mal cok bosver aw
Bide burda ulkene irkcilik yapilsa savunsan erdogani savunuyorsun diyorlar mal bunlar
Ben ırkçılığı savunmam
sen değil kardeşim bu sub da ülkene ırkçılık yapılsa erdağının götünü öp derler herkesi erdoğanı destekliyor diye biliyorlar :d
And nobody gives a fuck
Holy crap, in Turkey the rest of the sidewalk would turn and beat the shit out of the abductor
Are we living in the same country
We are only a little bit better than Belarus and our people don't even have balls to protest anything
Nobody would beat anyone for abducting people lol
Well the kids at bogazici clearly have more guts than you or I do
There’s been so many protests lately are you kidding me
And the police (in clear police clothing) have been arresting protestors
A friend of mine has been trying to get his friends out of jail for like two days in a row now
Also I dunno where you live but any kind of disturbance on my street is met by the people of my neighborhood immediately
The Baltics would share Ukraine's fate without NATO and EU
Without a doubt
Serbia isnt
edit: serbia wasnt in the warsaw pack my bad
Wait really
I thought they belonged
We also have this as turks; Bird massacare with one stone
Poland is alone :(

I could give an even more absurd example from Turkey

Queen Elizabeth II: *Wait for me Louis*
Turkey is the same, almost word for word
So are Russia and Hungary, apparently
Why has the world come to this
So Turkey is Islamic version of Poland
Change poland with turkey and its literally same here
Same kind of shit goes in Turkey
Erdogan’s channels say anti-opposition, anti-USA/EU/NATO etc kind of crap and whatnot (Whatever Erdo dislikes/opposes)
Poland is just like Turkey but Christian
Poland builds as many churchs as possible , follows nationalistic policy and says everyone is against us
Hmmm
that sounds very similar to TURKEY
This feels and looks all like Turkey in the last 10 years or so
I thought turkey was the only country that used this around Europe
No please no Turkey is surrounded by enemies
All the world against Turkey
It is like one day Erdogan came across on the street with Kacinski and Orban and told them;
„Guys, I have found an awesome strategy, you should definately try it, it works 100%. It is legit”
Never listen him
Shit they even have similar names
Now kith

Ily so much *now give me a passport
Even if I could visit 135 countries visa-free, I wouldn't. Turkish lira has less worth than Turkish passport lol
No way turkey's passport power is that high up
It's only good to use as an oven mitt or a coaster
I have a green turkish passport and i can travel visa free to 164 countries, exactly 67 more than regular turkish passport
suck it europe
türkiii besttttt
is this old
im looking turkish it shows 93
Don't be sad bro
Yeah Turkey has been padding these numbers with visa waiver agreements with Djibouti, etc
Meanwhile I cannot get into Greece (driving distance) without a visa
Also, some Turkish municipalities have been trafficking people to Germany with service passports, truly embarrassing stuff
Hopefully we will get rid of these cockroaches with the next election

What kind of lunatic parents would want their kids to move out at 16 ? South Eu rocks
I thought we had it bad due to low purchase power but looks like it's pretty similar throughout
In Turkey, yes
Most graduates can't even find a job in their field
The ones lucky enough to find a job generally make minimum wage only
You can't move out with that
I'm 23 studying in the same city w/ parents and i'm on my last year of education and there is no sight of me moving out in near future
And living with your parents even up to 35-40 is kinda acceptable here unfortunately due to economic reasons
Absoluetly true, in turkey you can't leave your home(rich peoples aside) without educating the university because everything is so expensive, you need a good job to buy yourself a house, car etc
If you leave your house in your 18's  you need to work where ever you find if you are not a brilliant person and most probably will need to take credit from a bank because the salary they give you will be 255€ or less, it's in extreme difficulty here
It's a figure of speech
I don't think parents should make their kids work or get them to pay rent before they're at least 18-19
These kids've got a long time comsumed by work ahead of their life already
Why not just let them live their youth without  having them worry about rent and bills and shit
I think it's a dick move and doesn't matter what part of the world you live in
That kid still needs you
I thought this was a Turkish problem
At least you guys stand up

No one care EU in Turkey
Who wants to join this club ? Europe is dying and no one fucking care this club
We will see, Britain left EU and others will left too, be sure
Radicals will come to power in EU countries and these radicals will destroy EU
Just here to give my two cents
Using the Turkish flag in this graphic, and in general, assuming the Turkish Republic is the successor of the Ottoman Empire in every regard is historically incorrect
Sevres and Lausanne are seperate treaties, there was a period of time ('20-'22) both in Istanbul and Ankara two 'governing mechanisms' existed simultaneously and Turkish Republic forcibly droped all Ottoman images & cultural traits after '23; so much so that the last Assembly of the Ottoman Empire and the second (or third) Assembly of the Turkish Republic had almost no one in common
Kemal Atatürk rebelled against the Ottoman Empire in '19 to start the Anatolian resistance against invading powers
He was deadly serious about cutting all ties with the Ottoman lineage and for the most part, he succeeded in doing so
Now; this does not diminish the magnitude of Armenian Genocide, how traumatic it was for Armenian people as a whole; nor does it absolve the actors behind the Genocide from blame or responsibility
It's just something I personally wish people would think about more, in designing graphics like this and also for trivial stuff like calling the Turkish civ in Civilization games 'Ottoman'. Because Ottoman were not a nationality, it's the name of a royal family that an empire also got named after
Just this, nothing more
*sigh*
if its not against the rules , it wont be taken down
problem is , its little better than trolling to just come to the sub and post this pic without any discussion or meaningful post attached to it
I wonder do people think writing “but what about armenian genocide” on every Turkish related post does anything at all
Like whenever I read a post about Turkey, there’s always one guy that mentions it
It doesn’t even trigger anynone, it’s just annoying
He blamed the Holocaust* on the Dutch, specifically to cause conflict before an election
His party runs on an us-vs
-them mentality
since yesterday the sub is under siege by trolls , people are riled up, its not the best time for cool headed , objective discussion
ever since yesterday , people just flock to r/turkey to post "recognize it" or similar stuff on completely unrelated threads
this picture was shared by atlesat 10 accounts this morning, it gets tiresome
average turk will not recognize it,but every year there is more and more discussion , more people who step up to apologize and call for discussions , sadly , constant trolling and patronizing stuff is not helping the turks who are trying to fight against the circle jerk
The Ottoman governance considered Turks to be peasants in their borders and didn't even speak Turkish
They were different culturally from Modern Turkey which was built on the Turkish identity
>doesn't mean turkey gets a pass
Gets a pass at _what_? Sorry for being Ottomans, I guess
Most of our (Turks of today) ancestors were barely even aware of the war, they were nomads or lived in rural villages
'Turk' was even an insulting term when used on an Ottoman noble
Well, would it change your opinion to find out that between '23 and '50 the alphabet changed, educational system was overhauled, Ottoman clothing such as fez were banned and replaced with Western counterparts, the demographics were shaken up via population exchanges & forced assimilation, economic policies were shifted intensely and new alliances were formed
I'm not here to give Turkey a pass from anything
I'm here arguing, because I'm genuinely tired of people both in Turkey and outside of Turkey automatically equating the Ottoman Empire with the new republic
I thought I made that clear when I specified that this doesn't absolve anyone from blame or diminish the trauma of the genocide for all Armenians
Guess not clear enough for everyone
Ottomans are something 'other than the Turks' though
Ottoman Empire also had Greeks, Armenians, Arabs, Assyrians, Kurds, Jews, Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats, Albanians
The ruling class was Turkish, yes; but same way the Greek culture you mention persisting despite Ottoman dynastic rule; so did Turkish culture
Mind you the ruling elite spoke a mixture of Farsi & Arabic; as opposed to the Central Asian remnant 'folk' Turkish, which Kemal Atatürk made the official language once he came to power
As a Turk living in Greece, I only fully understood what this distinction is once I came here
There is a seperate 'Ottoman' culture that pervaded from the palace, through the governors and the kadıs to the public (I'm talking about sayings, food, arts, entertainment etc
); but was at best a supraidentity, never distinct enough to overwrite existing cultures
You are right, coherence in religion and language through history helped these cultures survive
Greeks are Greeks and Turks are Turks
Both have Ottoman influence
None are complete successors to the Ottoman Empire
Who are 'we'? As in the general population of this subreddit
Are you asking me to tell you if I want people to 'deny' the Armenian Genocide because I'm trying to make a point about the relationship between Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic
Because I'm not
Didn't think I was
I agree %100
There's a great journalist, Hrant Dink, who summed it up best in my opinion
He said 'The Turks don't want to confirm the genocide, because they don't want to accept that their ancestors could have done such a horrible thing'. I agree with him also
I recommend anyone who's interested in Turkish-Armenian relations to look up his speeches and writings
He was a kind, smart, gentle, wonderful man
But he was shot and killed in broad daylight, and the cops who brought his killer in took selfies with the hitman in front of the Turkish flag
As far as I know, no-one apologized for that either
A) Not denying the genocide
B) Not going to take a reply starting with 'Just No' seriously as an intellectually valid commentary on the proceedings
C) Where the hell are Italians considered successors of the Roman Empire, that should be an example *I* should've used
You are right
The CUP was very racially motivated and not that far from the Nazis, ideologically at least
But on a state level, the amount of power they held in late Ottoman period did not translate to the new Republic at all

Nationalism kills, end of discussion really
People arguing from a nationalist perspective are laying the groundwork for further killing
Internationalism is the only way
And to Europeans agreeing with this, don’t think I am only talking of Turkish nationalism
Don’t see yourself as independent from *that* nationalism, because you are not
And if you think you are, congratz
You just engaged in nationalism
There is nothing more entertaining than watching all the Balkanposters fight over dumb stuff
This is the youtube comment section all over again
Europe always throws dirt on Turkey
Im just waiting for some Europeans to share some colonialism ideas of several Europe countries and their result of deaths lol
Turkish fathers cries for that too
Yeeeaaah, No
Turkey is a guarantor state in Cyprus obliged to protect lives of Turks in the island
The so called invasion is the right of Turkish government since she is  a guarantor state in Cyprus
Then government used its right due to the acts of terrorism against Turkish people in the island by EOKA
You can verify all of this with a quick google search
Edit:Typo
Welcome to the Balkans where everyone is invader and yet defender
Unpopular opinion: If Cyprus unites, violence will start again which probably will cost even more lives
Aww
Im sorry but ı cant hold myself moore, you and other 'western' subs always looking one sided
I can show you thousends of photographs which like that but Turkish father cries over his sons grave whitch killed by enosis "greek terrorist organization which aimed to asimilate Turks and be unite with greece" this operation triggered by increase of this kind of attack to Turkish villages, and ıts an operation which aimed to end this attacks and end both sides casualties
Do you realize that if military coup in Greece was prefented, massacres wouldn't happen and Turkey wouldn't be on island
Also, everyone deserves to live but children deserves it more than adults with rifles
You should not have try to exterminate your Turkish neighbors
If given chance i would serve in the army for a similar cause
Edit: Butthurt downvote squaaaaad
Don’t forget Syria, Iraq and Lebanon
thanks for ur support
They died 1000 years ago mate invading used to be popular then
What
Turk bad
Only turk kill
They do this shit in every case
No wonder why Erdogan gains so much friction, especially from the Turks living in Europe
Then they accuse Turks of being brainwashed
Behold the Greek brigade will not approve of your post
How dare you have a different opinion
You got it
This time it Turkey should do nothing
And get accused of Turkish Cypriot genocide 50 years later
shut the fuck up bot
You forgot to add that Junta was toppled thanks to the Turkish intervention
Check a few replies below
r/turkey is a political s-hole like r/europe
Thats why theres an alternative r/turkeyjerky lol we just laugh at memes, dude
I suggest the same to you
>The killings of Turkish Cypriots were not done by the republic of Cyprus but by an anti-government terrorist orginization (EOKA B)
So it's okay if your son killed by a terrorist orginization and we don't have to talk about it
We don't have to talk about the actions of Greek Junta
I think you just confessed the hypocrisy of this sub, It's not about the rightness of the operation
I love how you guys see Alexander the Great as hero who actually tried to conquer the known world
Well it depends on how it happens
If it’s peaceful not much would happen
Solution to economy was money laundering, not related to any of this events
Says the British guy
Pretty petty argument
Cyprus is in europe
>Also a lot of Turks say that Greek Cypriot people deserved to suffer because of EOKA B actions, equating all Greek Cypriots with EOKA B. As Turks love to point that PKK =/ Kurds, EOKA B =/ Greek Cypriots
Huh
Where did I say that
Like I said, I wasn't pointing the rightness of the operation or anything
I was talking about the hypocrisy of this sub (and the western world)
Well some people might not like that
I just stated a fact not an opinion altough second part was but Greeks arent ready for facts
They just wanna play victim and score symphaty points here
>I just had to point it out that the atrocities were committed by terrorists that had nothing to do with the ordinary Greek Cypriot people that suffered due to the invasion
I never said anything like that
Same thing goes for Turkish Cypriots as well
>I don't see how what I said was hypocritical
Dude I'm telling this for the third time now
I'm talking about the hypocrisy of the western world - not you, not something personal - and this sub, cuz while Greek Cypriots are heros, no one mentions about the Turkish side
It's not something new, we Turks always experience this hypocrisy
We dont care i just stated a fact you like it or not its up to you
Both events pretty unrelated btw
Whataboutism
I feel like my credit card was somehow charged for even looking at this picture
Why hold debates, when you don't have to
Just buy the media and make them just compliment your work

It is same situation in Turkey too

Because I've seen this same kind of ignorance shown towards White looking, "wow you don't look Turkish" Turks
Mediterranean is full of native white skinned blonde people as much as it is full of olive skinned black haired people
Our racial type is unknown honestly
Because we are Muslim and Asian people think we are freaking something else
But in reality we racially resemble Southern and Balkan Europeans much more than most Western people stereotype us to be
There ARE Turks that fit the Oriental "Brown" stereotype don't get me wrong
But there are LOADS AND LOADS of Turks who look like White Europeans
We are just a hell of a weird country on that sense, but considering our geographical location it makes sense
We aren't called a bridge for nothing
WTF is this
Soviet attack again
But not Turkey lol
You are seriously underestimating the number of European looking Turks
I would say it’s more than Armenia
When are we gonna get protests

With one side of the medal, what you say is rational
However you do not see the other side of the medal tbh
Under this sub or lots of subs, it is so common to find the expressions like "Turks genocided Armenians", "You first answer how you genocided Armenians" etc
This things are never a cause of ban or even a reaction of common sense
Please tell me how does this help our "Holy peacekeeping mission"?
On humanist base, I agree almost everything with your comment
However the reality is not that simple
Please comfort me by saying "this expressions doesn't help any to hatred towards Turks".
Let's not fool anyone, If banning something is what the powerful one wants, than it is banned
There is no logic behind it
My own country does this on lots of topics and I hate it with all my heart
When Europeans does it, I have no aim to like it, too
Mine did that, he'd base his lessons on activities on the news

Meanwhile in Turkey: We are afraid of protesting despite the government f*cking us everyday
It's fake but in a sarcastic way
Erdogan really appointed himself
This is a sarcastic document about it
Aren't we lucky as Turks
What a time to be alive, amirite
This is sarcasm why are you downvoting this
He does whatever the fuck he wants
In rallies his facial expression towards his supporters is sometimes like "you fucking retards, I can rape your mother and you'll still worship me right
There was a video of an AKP supporter who said "If I see Erdoğan and my mother on the same bed, the blame would be on my mother" so it's not like we are that far off from that anyway
*Yawn*. It is a wonder that they launched this at a time when capitalism’s failures are so bluntly apparent
Sorry but this made me and a couple friends laugh like crazy

I completely agree with you regarding Erdoğan's regime, but as you said, Turkey has been waiting in line way before Erdoğan came to power

Erdoğan doesn't actually rig elections
About %40 of the country is just too stupid to understand how democracy works
Years ago when he said democracy is a train he will get off at the right station he was being hailed as a beacon of democracy and hope & example for other nearby countries by Europe lol
It is amazing how Europeans now have the surprised pikachu face
The guy never even bothered to hide his intentions
He was the same person
You pampered him for years and now suddenly Erdo terrible
You don't say
FYI: We don’t like Erdoğan because he fucked our economy, not because we want to give lands to anyone
Thank you
The sad thing is he puts the whole population in a miserable situation and people know they are in a shitty situation but he also gives them hope that there are better days to come and blames the shittines on the opposing parties and Gülen (who he befriended in the first place btw)
This is the Orwellian shit we are going through, and people don’t know they are in a populistic scheme, they barely know how to wash their asses
Turkish population is very old like only around 23 percent are 18-25, another 23 percent is children not able to vote, and the rest is these fossils who came from a shitty education, abandoning their villages to prosper in the shitty jobs that a large city like İstanbul offers
Atatürk saw that education was a big problem in those villages, he wanted these “villager institutes” to be built and they taught everything from classic literature to mathematics that a modern citizen needed to know
Then came along these landlords saying these institutes were “communistic” and that they were threatening their position, America didn’t help either: they told that if we wanted the aid of bazillions of shitty tin canned food, we needed to shut down those institutes, and so we did
Now the population needs to shed the older generation at least to level the ground with the current regime, I just hope it betters with time, I can’t do anything else
Era of erdo is ending soon but I don't find westerners sincere on willing turks good
They only wish him fall because of his foreign politics, which is not affecting negatively turkish people
As a turkish, I find it hard to share common enthuasiastism in collaboration with european kids
as a Turk yes it is true
Help
His attitude won't survive
The only reason he managed to remain for so long is that he really managed to use Goebbels tactics to the bit .
&#x200B;
But with current youth, he's nothing but a mockery
No exaggeration
Not even a single "Turkey is not Europe" comment, yeaaaaaaaah based
Sadge :(
Pls save me sos
Damn his Hand remind ne Doom fist
It gets even more sad when you learn that every teen adult is working real hard to get the hell out of Turkey
Agree as a Turkish
Turkey never had modern democracy in the first place
My eyes are full of tears after seeing how our beloved European friends caring about wellfare of Turkish people and democracy
Come on guys just don't be subtle
Be direct
Who in Europe gives a damn about democracy in Turkey and Turkish people's wellfare
You were always okay with him as long as it fit you
Our dear democracy protector Macron loves freedom and democracy
That's why he likes and works with Haftar and Sisi
I like European people, I really do
But your hypocrisy and virtue signalling are killing me
Tr de demokrasi mi vardı aq
Our economy is getting worse and worse each year education is a nightmare people are hungry and İ wish i was born in germany ;(
I really want to do this too
Yes, they somehow think that we don’t like him because we want to give lands or something
He uses religion and fucked our economy so young people doesn’t like him but there are people who thinks Islam will be ruined if he is gone so they still vote for him
There are other reasons too but these are the main ones
[oof]
The education system is getting fucked our economy keeps getting worse each day and people are depressed because they can't live their lives like all otjer people do
Why would we want Iran land
Makes no sense
Wanting it for Azerbaijan is more sensible
You mean, Karabakh
I didnt count Americans when spit out "westerners" because of I guess an ordinary american have no clue what is going on in Turkey
Ofc they are westerners as well
But my words look accurate for mediterrenean coasts to scandinavians, at least among the redditers
Everytime I check any post or comment includes the subject of Turkey, I also see hatred towards to Turkish people or Turkey itself
All people would enjoy a chat with me in a bar suddenly becomes a historic enemy in their minds
It is the issue
Btw thanks for the kind feedback
We dislike Iran and Saudi Arabia too, you’re not alone
And I’m happy to hear you like us
Lovely

Yeah there was an earthquake in İzmir and everyone started panicking about the mutation
We already have, find another land piece
Yes, I have been in Incirlik air base once owing to my dad's business
It definetely creates a emotional bridge between americans and turks in Adana, the city where air base is located
Also I lived in there for 10 years
Yeah covid mutation first seen in the UK
People started panicking about it and there are lots of fake news about it
Fascist is not land piece

As a Turk living in Turkey i am just wondering if we sent only our douches to Western Europe or we sent normal people and they became douches there
Immigrants tend to be more rude, more radical and more big-headed and more bigoted than Turkey Turks
Propaganda is the essence of politics
You can't avoid it
Looks like the flag of some dystopic government set in a sci-fi movie
Flag of Imperalists
Totally agree about GDP, Turkish GDP is increasing but it's totally because things got way more expensive
Yes but your own happiness isn't the most important thing in the world

Germany : *_i'm safe_*
I thought we had street view EVERYWHERE in turkey, but seeing the western Europe having much more feels ridiculous to me
Germany, Austria and Turkey has partial street views
I sense something in here
In turkey 120 km/h means drive 132 km/h
10% so I guess the actual limit in Cyprus is 120 km/h. Does the police give you trouble if you drive with 120 km/h ?
Preparing foe the long sleep
Malta aint much bigger than Luxemburg either
Wonder why it's never included
Oh, I'm blind
I don't think they are oppressed victims, I just say they have the right to self-determination
Sorry I made an ignorant comment
So what do you think about Kurds in Turkey and the Middle East
Weird
The right to self-determination is the natural right of every people
Whether a people is cruel or oppressed, the right to self-determination cannot be usurped
The Kingdom of England usurp the Scots 'right to self-determination, just as Turkey usurp the Kurds' right to self-determination
I support the idea of ​​an independent Kurdistan
>All I remember is that turkey was fighting the Kurds who were fighting Assad and Isis
I don't know much about their culture and where their historic land is but it seems as if turkey is trying to prevent them breaking off Turkish territory
Yes, Turkey organized military operations in northern Syria (Rojava) to support Assad and the Ba'ath Party
Another purpose of these operations was ethnic cleansing
Führer explains why Kurds should be [killed]
>''Erdogan: The important thing is to keep such a region under control and to work in a controlled way, and Arabs should live in this region because the Kurds are not suitable for living in this geography
>Announcer: Why
>Erdogan: Because these are desert regions
This is all Erdogan's knowledge of anthropology:Arabs live in the desert, Kurds live in the mountains
An example of what was done to Kurds in Turkey is what happened in [Diyarbakır prison
>32 women who remained in Diyarbakır prison in those years;
* "We were subjected to all kinds of torture, including electricity, but the worst was sexual torture
* "They took the women they raped to the ward with their bloody skirts
* "They put the skirts on our heads, they strip us, they say 'travel'."
* "They came out of the bathroom in a robe and masturbated while looking at us
* "The biggest torture was listening to the screams of other women
* "They forced the women to drink their sewers
The Republic of Turkey is the home of racism and fascism btw kemalism
We must support the Kurdish people who are exposed to this fascism
As someone who knows the history of the Ottoman and the Republic, I say that;
Erdogan = Ataturk + Abdul Hamid II
I hate him and his idols too
All right SÖR.
Okay what the fuck is wrong with Hungary here
I like this drink, whats it called
beer, bier, biere, bierra cervesa, cerveza, cervexa
ah yes good ol garagardoa
Lol öl means die in Turkish
South half of Cyprus:
Ölme
And thats why we love you
Turkey speaks a Turkic Language which is originated all the way from Altai Mountains near modern day Mongolia
And they had the grace to call it bira as god intended
Here's a trivia then: sıra means ''turn'' in Turkish
Weird
Some people are just cruel, man
Did you just forget the glorious kingdom of S E A L A N D?
[It remind me this]
It was because of a political problem that was happened in 2017
I don't remember why it was happened but some pro erdogan fans protest it by squishing oranges and drinking juice lol
Yeah, it's abnormaly cold in Turkey, too
Almost 10 degrees below normal spring temperatures
There was snow in Thessaly, Greece yesterday
It's bizarre to see people who refuse climate change is real, even now
So norway is going to be world's new northern pole
It's so sad to see always poor people suffer from wars
Ofc I have never seen someone rich fighting in front line
As a Turk you should never say such thing as it proves that you have no clue about your own history
Turks lost almost all of their shining generations, from rich to poor, educated to business people during and post WW1
It still stands as one of the main reason why we’re not developed country since it left us only nomadic / village population left in our countryside
No university students, no professors, no good business people, no high elite left due to wars, migrations and political conflicts caused by the war itself
When I said that I remembered our fallen soldiers history againts PKK
The fallens are mostly from villages with poor/non educated places
Ofc they are joining the army for money because he can't find job elsewhere
Like it is his last hope
Not every sergeant die but I hear in news once or more each week
I've stopped even folowing military news long ago
Dunno how it is now
I agree both are unnecessary but uncircumcised dick looks ugly
I mean everybody get circumcised here but still every guy horny as fuck
I don't think it is a serious sensitivity lost
Is this mean uncircumcised guys reach orgasm sooner because more nerve more sexual pleasure
Or they only have greater orgasm than circumcised guys
ah yes
Forza horizon 4
Wow forza horizon 4 is a reality

I hope we don't have to make same folders for Kurdistan :p

In that case I hope they try something radically different than the typical parliamentary or presidential system

The difference between a patriot and a traitor is whether or not they win the war

Very well deserved Catalans
*grabs popcorn*
STRONG CATALONIA
In the moment every revolution seems like it was started by madmen
If the Catalonians can kill more Madrdians then they will have true independence
The only recognition you will get is from occupied territories or countries that just really hate Spain
What happens when the Spanish government stops receiving money from the northeast of Spain
If the Catalans truly view themselves as independence why do their taxes go to someone else
All the businesses, accountants and personal accounts of Catalans would redirect their payments to "Barcelona" or whatever they choose to be the new seat of government
This is how you cripple your former nation if you're vying for independence
Madrid can't send in the troops to beat you down if they can't pay them with your money
This is all dependent on you being the economic engine of said former country though
Romania be like: nonononoyes
â, û and î not in [Turkish Alphabet] but in some words like hâlâ, hükûmet and dinî . Idk why they arent adding that letters in official Turkish alphabet
Lol "qırımtatar tili" literally translates to "Crimean Tatar Language" whereas there is a literal "Tatarça" which looks the more appropriate way to name an language, I wonder why they did not just name it "qırımtatarça" or something like that
But if it continues after saying no, ain't it harrasment
I really do wonder that too
Those letters are clearly needed yet not official

Fantastic move
We need to replace these statues with monuments (whether humans or not) that we can objectively agree are of virtuous figures who helped develop solidarity, education, egalitarianism, health and social services, equality etc

LoL Smyrna
Virtue signaled whataboutism, gibs me my upvotes :D
You are pathetic
I recognize the genocide, but what’s the point of this shit you posted
You wanna be European so bad you inherited their imaginary moral high horse
Smyrna flair, LMAO
Keep jacking off to their little gestures as they continue to exploit half the fucking world
I am irritated by people always commenting based on a person's flair
You guys have to open your minds to the fact people are individuals and you don't have to escalate discussions into these little digs based on stereotypes or based on national policy which individual humans have no control over
I personally don't deny the genocide, you could probably have inferred that based on my comment and so there was no need for you to bring it up and just become another robot that brings up the Armenian Genocide whenever a Turk shares their opinion online
I didn't wish to go down this rabbit hole, but you've roused me
>It's not just the Armenians
Greeks, Assyrians, Kurdish etc
Turkey used to be a pretty diverse country
I am aware of this of course
But pray tell me this, are you aware that each Balkan country and each Caucasus country used to be similarly pretty diverse countries
Every single post-Ottoman State purified their borders in this same way as Turkey did, during the process of and after gaining independence
All were formerly diverse lands that were homogenised by killings, exiles and forced assimilations due to nationalistic and racist fervour during the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire and rise of Nationalism in each new ethnostate
It's why the ratio of Turks and other language speaking Muslims in the Balkans and Caucasus is far less than it was in Ottoman times, it's why the ratio of Christians and Jews in Turkey is far less than it was in Ottoman times
It's not only conflict between religions, even within religions the Christians did this to each other as well and their current lands have less diversity of Christian ethnic groups than they did in Ottoman Times
the land now called Greece had more Slavic speaking Christians in Ottoman Times and the Slavic speaking countries had more Greek speaking Christians in Ottoman Times than they do now
Jews are far less in number across all forementioned lands as well
My beef as a Turk is why we never talk about the "Ethnic cleansing and genocides that occured during the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire" and why the topic is always centered around putting Turks into a corner to admit the Armenian genocide
It's never felt right to me considering the aforementioned history
>Do you judge your fellow Turks the same way you judge foreign genocide deniers, and foreign genociding leaders
Turks don't deny the genocide at an individual level, it's a governmental political position of semantics
Government doesn't even deny the genocide happened, they just have a particular problem with that word
If the subject could be reframed as "Ethnic cleansing and genocides that occured during the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire" I have no doubt Turkey would readily admit it and use the word
>The people who committed the Armenian genocide are like national heroes in Turkey
This is not true
Ah yes Armenia, Europe
Now that, is some good example of a settlement
Well, technically it's just Eurasia anyway
In Orkhon Inscriptions, the Turkish Khaghan Bilga from about 6th century had written that even though he was inclined to convert to Budism, his second in command, Tonyukuk   warned him that China is relentless, allowing themselves to be too reliant to the Chinese will cause long term subordination and they shouldn't be tricked by short-term gains
It's not the same thing maybe, but it still ads-up with today's situation
China is not to be trifled with, they're basically taking over countries via infrastructure deals
Good idea from turkey
Wow

Don't give illiterate ignorant stupid peasants right to vote and expect them to make rational decisions
Democracy is an idealist and overly-optimist concept
You know that they put crap ton of fake YES votes then goverment made them legalright
Remember that "Yes" won, so enough people live in the red areas and enough people voted yes in blue ares to win the referendum
It's not like red cities are empty deserts

What happened
turkey bad now give upvote
8 hours this post stood up and its from a very obvious agenda pushing account that's supposedly against r/europe's rules
I am sure people  reported it to mods yet its been around for almost a whole day
>No agenda pushing: Refers to accounts which persistently post or comment on one topic and/or attempt to derail normal conversations in order to support their agenda
This rule will be applied especially strictly for new accounts
/r/Europe isn't an outlet for propaganda
What is going on here
Here is a funfact; my mother worked as a Nurse in a Kurdish town in 1980s, when so-called Kurdish independence fighters raided the city, they killed every single person
Even the dogs and sheep
"Ethnic cleansing" towards a terrorist organisation
Good
I am looking forward for it
It's not about Erdoğan at all
Turkey has been suffering from terrorism for decades and when we stop fighting them, they get stronger and explode themselves in our city centers, killing civilians
Even after Erdoğan Turkey won't stop
Keep believing every single propaganda terrorists perform on the Internet but it won't change the reality
No one can do anything about it
As an Erdoğan hater I say that
Lmao the shit people upvote in this sub
It's amazing to me that in this day and age; where we understand that discriminating people based on their skin color or their sexual orientation is wrong, there's this comment section which people discriminate other people based on their **leader**. People are not their leaders
People are not their government
Democracy can not ensure 1 on 1 societal representation
We can't assume all Americans are crooked or all New Zealanders are compassionate because of Donald Trump or Jacinda Ardern
We can't hold up bigoted and ignorant beliefs like "if you visit Turkey you're supporting Erdoğan". We have to go meet all peoples, talk to all peoples and engage with all peoples in this beautiful age of global travel & communications
Top-to-bottom bigotry and isolation will only perpetuate the problem and make more Erdoğan supporters out of the moderate people
Another bullshit fake news about turkey
PKK is a terrorist organisation which do things like Kidnapping, Woman Trade, Slavery, Drug Trade etc
They are an actual terrorist organisation and no we are not attacking Barzani (Leader of Kurdistan) we are attacking PKK and its not ethnic cleansing if that were the case Police would attack kurds in Ankara, İstanbul, Antalya, İzmir etc
Ethnic cleansing
Wtf when was killing terrorists become ethnic cleansing
Why am I not surprised to see this shit every day
I am in Turkey rigth now and I can't see anyone dying
I only can see Kurds having extra rights and priviliges for being a minority
a misleading title with propaganda
this is not about Erdogan
I don't like Erdogan at all but this is a propaganda against Turkey by terrorists
Turkey didn't bomb those places because Kurds live there
There are 18 millions Kurdish people live in Turkey
no one bombs them
Turkey bombs terrorist hideouts
and you people contributing this propaganda which means you are helping terrorist who uses suicide bombers to kill civilians including children
its hard for you to understand because it doesn't happen to you
when you guys outraged by ISIS using suicide bombers and you guys supported your armies bombing ISIS hideouts
its basically same thing
PKK is a terrorist organization
It doesn't matter what they fight for
They kill innocent people, children, teachers, ambush ambulances
This isn't a reliable news source, you are just an anti-turk
Look at that person's profile it's full of fake bullshit news about Turkey
turkey bad, give me upvote
What about israel ? no one gives a shit about this country they are act like douche
Why this sub never say anything about israel's behavior
it doesnt suprise me at all that seems like something erdoğan would do
I dispise this man
He's one of the great aggrevators of tension in especially Syria for years now
But the ''kurdish existence'' this article speaks of is actually an insurgency, recognised as a terrorist organization by US and UN
If they were attempting to make a cleansing, they'd to it in Southeastern towns, where majority are kurdish
Turkey is committing some crimes in the Middle East, I can say
This, is not one of them
So stop bullshitting folks
Russia once published footages of his son-in-law smuggling oil from ISIS territories
Focus on that, that is a real crime
Be that it's a bit old now
Europe, what an easy target for propaganda
They have money, they don't know a single thing about middle East, they hate Turks
Well drop a donation link to them so they can buy you some bombs
Armenian genocide now give upvote
It's the UAE and its because of Erdogan, Qatar and Libya

[THANK YOU
This basically sums up my whole life of commenting on articles about Turkey on the Anglosphere internet
Based
Keep using such heavy words for shit like this and they'll stop meaning what they used to mean
I think the difference is that Europeans, in our modern time, are synonymous with and prided upon their progressive values
So it's always ironic that on a forum that is about Pan-European identity, an identity shaped by aforementioned progressive values, that people display such toxic non-progressive behaviour
It's like they've totally misunderstood what the underlying logic and solidarity behind Pan-European identity is all about
Because of this, Europeans are held to a higher standard than other peoples
Its Turkey, its a nice way of referring to Turkey in a sarcastic comment
To enhance the sarcasm of the comment, i could have said kebab country as well but I didn't
There is no reason, no reference or anything
Just sarcasm and silliness
Seriously there is no reference or anything its just a cheap wordplay
Because its a wordplay from English
Because [Turkey the bird] and [Turkey the country] dude you are way too overthinking
Ow France
The city of freedom, passion, love
Why all the roofs have flues
Seems weird to me
That's just a propaganda
Incredibly skeptical
If such thing happened Russian radars would have probably picked the position of this claimed Turkish F-16 over Armenia
Russia has a base in Armenia after all
And listing sources that only reports the claims of Armenia aren't "sources" on whether this happened or not
This is a fake news
Armenia always do same thing there are no reliable news about that or news source
This is still not confirmed after so many hours
Any update on this
Armenians and greeks strongly believe the jet shut down, turks and azeris strongly believe it is not, so it is a belief issue
I go with do not believe
Any proof
You guys were right, should have not called it fake news and got lots of downvotes for no reason
Here is the proof that Turkey shot down the alleged armenian jet
&#x200B;
Lies
Many hours passed still no confirmation has come
It's very clear this claim isn't true but people are still discussing like it really happened, pretty stupid
I feel like one day Turkey will really shot down one plane and nobody will believe it like that shepard boy story
Its fake news guys
Propaganda
news from armenian propaganda machine they really want to pull russia on their side but they dont know if russia join the party thinks get worse beucuse turkey iran and israel is allready in caucas if russia involve thats mean america involve too
i call bullshit
wasn't us
Fake news
USSR should’ve just said it is Armenian land instead of Azerbaijani in 1980’s...
Still waiting for more news
And still waiting a not proven flair
This kind of claims just further damage everything
Unfortunately mod team is sleeping on this
Armenia occupying a foreign country territory and kill people
who is the lunatic
Finally, someone with a common sense
There is no such thing as fellow Christians when it comes to politics of nations
What do you think this is 1300s or something
Us secular turks stand with you guys
did we ask tho
If you wanna stand with them so much
You can join them, they'll give you an ak47
But you need to hurry cus your Armenian bruuthers are getting wiped out right now
Nooo
Ermenians fucked up army can beat worlds 8th most powerful army nooooo /s
What about the Armenian propaganda machine
My ass
It'll not believe me
Our mighty leader's ego would be wounded
We're able to defend ourself
Thank you for your kind wish that would end up killing my people if it happens
I too hope that one of the largest armies in the world bomb my country and possibly kill the people i love because of the actions of one insane guy
Καλημερα, neighbor
just like the way we're gonna throw you malakas to aegean
> I hope Russia will hit the Turks
Keep dreaming
lol
Yes now We're out of nato cus an idiot Canadian man said so
At the end of the day, We belong to the west
Our relationship with Russia is nothing more than strategic
nato is basically free defence for turkey at this point with no return
Funfact: Turks have a huge drone industury which can destroy Armenian forces in hours (which is showcased in Syrian civil war), therefore no one would risk their pilots lives to shoot down just one plane
If Turkey wanted to participate in that war, it would destroy infastructure and land forces of the Armenians by using drones, not risking their planes and soldiers in dog fights
&#x200B;
Armenians are trying to play "victims" while actively invading Azerbaijani land
Lmao
isnt a proxy war 2 states supporting opposing sides in a rebellion
The unsourced fake news are at it again
İt was ottomans  , i have accepted the Armenian genocide as a Turk but this comment is bullshit
Turkey didn't do that this post is unsourced
aren't you late to rake your forests ? Fuck off
ah yes the spokeperson
I understand Greece and Armenia but why you too
they're taking what's theirs
Now downvote me mothafuckas
You must be pretty stupid to put religion first before your interests
You just cover-up the ugly side of things by using religion such as "how much will I gain from this and what am I going t lose in return"
Same with using Christianity or Islam
**Usa would like to talk to you**
We can't do shit to Russia, believe me, .If they hold the tourist from coming to us
We're fucked
It was one of the worst years for our country when we shot down the Russian jet
are you like the embassador of bulgaria because you act like you do but in fact you are just some rando on the internet
Edit:r
Nah, I think we will be fine with Bulgaria
Not towards Bulgaria
It's pretty positive when it comes to them actually
I'd argue Russia had no intention to take over Ukraine in the first place
They got Crimea and secured their port
They cut Donbass from the rest of the country, giving them an open wound that will keep bleeding and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO at the same time
There is no point in trying to invade an entire country which also happens to be one of the biggest in Europe in terms of landmass
Too much territory to hold onto with a hostile population you need to deal with
Makes absolutely no sense at all from Russian perspective
Similarly with Turkey, I don't even think it will lead to a hot conflict between our countries but even if it does, I'm perfectly sure Turkish borders would remain intact
We don't even share a land border with Russia, it's not like they'll roll the tanks in and try to occupy our land
"I am going to fight for my religion," said no one whatsoever
And religion doesn't tip the scales
People use it as a cover to make them feel better
I dunno, Armenia warned about this specifically yesterday, and now they claim this with no further proof
Seems fishy to me
You said your money was on russia i said that because usa won't like that it isn't so funny and by the way Armenia first attacked
In my opinion Bulgaria won't risk a conflict with a major trade partner
I didn't expect them to like us, i just stated that Turkey does not act hostile towards Bulgaria
Btw lucikly reddit users don't rule their countries, as Bulgaria is friendly with Turkey in real life
Like that's not what they have been doing since the Soviet Union days
Those AK's, Iglas and Atgm's doesn't grow on trees
Well I'm not actually sure about AK's but rest definitely doesn't.
I see this comment here and there many times to arm Kurds but practically they’re being armed for almost 50 years already by many countries
What you guys think of Turkey and Kurds
There are like millions of Kurds waiting to be armed in Turkey so they can cause civil war
This is not Syria
Turkey won the battles against Pkk long ago within its borders and its done deal
There is nobody left to arm, they are all gone to Syria and became YPG, an organization that Turkey started war couple years ago and pushed from its borders again
So again, it’s done deal
The maximum Russians can do provide manpads to YPG and hope downing of more Turkish jets, which Turkey will eventually make more offensives and take more cities within Syria
Even if you’re America, you can’t beat a country mobilizing army in its backyard unless you openly war with them
Can Russia war against Turkey on Turkish border
Yes they can
But they can’t project their full power regarding logistical issues while Turkey can fly over the Syrian skies easily considering the amount of airbases in Turkey
Erdogan does not trust NATO, he knows he is a regional power and whole this shitshow is happening on the region he is the most powerful
That’s the reason of his flex
Ottoman empire is really god example when it comes to how religion is used as cover up
Biggest example is Mehmet the second
And when it comes to Christianty, we saw how Chatolics sacked the İstanbul
They were their religion brothers, I wonder were they thinking the same thing when they were counting the Ortodox golds
I don't know about them being stationed there but this isn't a proof, not even remotely
They often participate in combat excercises with Azerbaijani pilots
This means nothing
Why would we start a conflict with bulgaria
Look at all the places where cocks will be drawn
Your country is run by PiS lol why do you sound like Poland is living in 2100 and Romania is a shithole
Somebody map this in assetto corsa or something
RIP USSR
This looks extremely arbitrary like Baltics central Europe

[Fixed it
So Cyprus is in Europe while having a 700km sea between it and mainland Europe, but a stair keeps Turkey out of Europe
How conveniently it includes Cyprus
Cyprus, Malta, Chios, Rhodos and Lesbos aren't part of Europe geographically
Even Lombardia would fit quite well
Hey I ride a bike in Istanbul, and I don't feel like people are trying to kill me, at least, not compared to when I was biking in Chicago
I'm shocked at how much space people in Istanbul give me
Istanbul's roads are narrow and rhere's nowhere to go,but people give me space
Chicago's roads are crazy wide with lots of space to pass, but people were aiming for me there
I was surprised, I thought I'd run into psychopaths a lot
So far I've only run into idiots, and that doesn't bother me so much
Idiots are idiots, they don't pay attention, psychopaths are aiming for you, and I haven't yet experienced that in Istanbul, while it was a near daily occurance in Chicago
I'm honestly amazed, because I really did think Istanbul would have more psychopaths than Chicago
Idiots are predictable, so they're not really a problem, IMO
To be fair though, even my car driving style fits in perfectly in Istanbul, so I guess I've been ready for driving/biking in the city my whole life :P Now that I live there its just perfect for me
I always wish there were less idiots, but I got used to 50% idiots, 2% psychopaths, and 48% OK Drivers in Chicago, and, well, it takes a lot to phase me now
the 10% idiots, .01% psychopaths, and 89
99% OK drivers in Istanbul is a pretty big upgrade for me
And on top of that, in Chicago I spent half my time on paths off of city streets, and it was still miserable overall
Not enough to stop me from biking because its really good for me and a lot of fun, but GOD DAMN are chicago's drivers fucking crazy
Have you ever driven in the U.S.? Compared to the U.S., Istanbul is paradise, and the traffic death rates reflect that
Istanbul is 1/100K, the Safest U.S. City is 3,4/100K, Chicago is 5,5/100K U.S. Average is 10,5/100K Turkey average is 8,7/100K IIRC
WAS THIS ALSO PART OF YOUR PLAN, JOJO
"W-Was this also part of your plan, Joseph
Lol India is one of the richest nation on earth lmfao
>Dutch and Danish standards of living are way better than French or British
That's what happen when you're a small country
It's not even important who is richer than who, all of that is  irrelevant lmfao
France, Danemark and The Netherlands and the UK are four countries with a overhaul small populations
Most of the peple born in those countries can be freacking delighted that they weren't born in some unknown shithole deep in Russia or India
Standards of live can still improve but many European are too focus on themselves and are not able to look around them
> Switzerland than Pennsylvania
What in hell is this logic
> Population doesn't make for a good country
>it was about the fact that 40% of the population still shits in the open because they don't have toilets or won't use toilets
Ok dude
Haha nice job Turkey, keep it up
Doing amazingly there not closing down one of the biggest cities in the world
Oh yeah, totally Erdo-boy let's fucking pray the sickness away, there you go
You don't have to pretend like you care of Turkey
The health system in Turkey is on top 3 in Europe
Btw i'm really worried about Germany
The death rate has been increasing rapidly in [Germany
At] the first,they were testing teens generally,(approximately like %90)
And now they are testing old people and the old people in Germany are dying in pain
Truths hurt
I Like Orange color tint
Lol not surprised
To be honest, people in Turkey subreddit were pointed out the fact that AK Trolls(people who pushes AKP or Erdogan Propaganda) has taken over the subreddit couple months ago
If so gaining popularity in that subreddit may result one person who has government connection to check the subreddit
This shows the why it is high due to there were anti-AKP posts
Didn't even know that the government was aware of Reddit
Not suprised at all
Remove kebab but it is reverse
Lmao, as a Turkish citizen, I expected that
duuude
delet this
I'm Turkish but I've never heard of someone who wants to remove content from reddit
İts probably not from the government
I honestly doubt that the idiots ruling us know about Reddit .
Well, there is anti Russia and anti Turkey posts at least 10 times more than the whole list combined as well
Edit: So nice people are here fanatics even downvote post stating facts
I bet its actually probably more to do with the Syrian conflict
Or maybe it's the kUrDiSh GeNoCiDe
I have seen more pics of French and British Protestors than post criticising Turkey, at least those which reach the frontpage
The whole "Armenian thing" shows how invested and studied in the subject .
It is for porn
Some can argue the opposite bloc is more deserving or rather equally deserving the same criticism
Those are temporary, the criticism Russia and Turkey get is constant
People love to create enemies in their brains and unite against it
Saudi Arabia is 1000 worse than any of the two regarding democracy and posing potential threat to lives of Europeans, but it’s a weak country that pays a lot to Europe, so we see Putin bad, Erdo bad posts 1000 times more
As in the government is requesting porn be taken down on Reddit
[The Reddit admin spez said "Most likely porn"]
Yes, I mean, they shutdown every fucking porn site with URL filtering
Why not request it aswell
Let’s constantly post genocides Europe, Canada, America committed and try to get these countries punished with the discourse, and let’s praise Isis equally just as we do for YPG and let’s talk about puppet regimes Americans are installing by sabotaging countries instead of Putin’s imperialistic dreams and see the results
But if it’s gonna make you more happy and moral high person, let’s not discuss
All those countries listed are angels, Putin is evil, Erdogan is sultan wannabe
Thanks god we have European countries uphold our perfect free lives
Ahhh so they were requesting full subreddits to be blocked
That's interesting
I guess if they can't get it all with imgur and url bans they have to go after the actual subs too
So weird

''Respect my religion that calls you infidels dogs and animals, or I'll kill you because I'm a follower of everything that're holy
What I wonder, how can someone get to this point in his mind
Like, there are a lot of things I just hate, but deciding to kill a random guy as a response is like, what the fuck
As a Turk, I am with France
Fucking cunts are gonna result in Islam being hated even more by the west and thats gonna result in major govt support
DONT G I V E  U P
Hey man, a Turk here
Our relations might not be the best for now, but it doesn't really matter
I wish you and your country best of the luck
I know you all are strong enough to overcome this tough times
Stay safe
They did that after 2 turkish descendent citizen get attack by Armenian protesters
(I don't remember at which country it happened
But it was an European one)
Stop acting like they're just having their daily routine
Bad guess as that event was a response protest agaist beatings of Azeris in an Armenian rally
It was a demonstration to taunt Armenians who did the beating
There is a reason that group literally didn't beat anybody just marched on street
Erdoğan literally has zero reletion with terrorism in europe lol Millions of Turks live there and they don't knife people over religion
Lots of Turks in Europe worship him he can say attack tomorrow and they will but he never done that
Erdoğan's method for dealing insults is suing with his army of lawyers
He just sued Geert Wilders for that reason he proably will do the same with charlie hebdo
Unless the guy is confirmed to be Turkish this comment is massive misunderstanding of the situation in France
Arabs don't really hold Erdoğan as leader of muslims
How is the Nagorno Karabakh war, which is a territorial dispute in which Armenia is officially and internationally recognized as foreign occupiers, related to Islamic terrorism in Europe
Your propaganda driven mentality wants other people to join you in your crusade but France is France
Russia is also Europe, so as Turkey, and Portugal, and Belarus
Stop trying to make it look like there is a race or culture called European
Ahval is anti Turkey newspaper is being funded by America exiled Turkish coup platter Fetullah Gulen, and to claim protesting people are in search of Armenians to kill is just utmost bullshit propaganda
How would a sane person eat this shit
Believe that over hundred people woman and man are searching for a race to kill, where its known Turkish people are not known with terrorism acts
And person who brought this bullshit here is a Greek, even trying to connect such sad event to their classical Turkish hatred to gain political points
I want him gone
But I don’t want him to become a martyr because that’d make things worse
Now imagine this guy fucks your country and you can't even run away
Maybe I am naive but I never understood why Europeans cared so mcuh about Erdoğan
If I lived in Germany I would just turn my head away and keep living in peace
Or rather I would maybe question my own country for having millions of Erdobots
isnt far right growing in europe as a whole
OK, so do you believe it is more plausible that this attack happened because of Erdogan or because of further publishing of Charlie Hebdo cartoons, which was the previous reason for previous attacks as well
Edit: lol at Turkey calling for persecution of Armenians
What world do you live in
You’re right, but if you want to fact check me, you can find many anti-Erdogan democratic pro western people bash Ahval news and refuse to work there
Gulen did not flee coz of Erdogan, he fled our secular regime back then when Erdogan wasn’t even a name
It’s hard to imagine
But all my life I’ve had Erdogan’s party holding power
And I guess I’m not hopeful anymore
I just fail to see things getting better after years of it getting worse, but maybe that’s just the failure of my imagination
Because after all, even if Erdogan goes away, all the people who followed him won’t.
Do you realize not many Muslims or Arabs (which are mostly the attackers in these attacks) follow or like Erdogan
Erdogan only speaks tough like that for his own Muslim followers in Turkey
I highly doubt he has any influence on non-Turks in Europe as almost every Arab I've met in Europe hates him
> by killing Kurds and Armenians
Can you provide examples please
There is no national pride in killing anyone, this is a myth, a lie and ignorant
You're spreading lies about people
People tend to give this organization that much credit, just another Turkey topic
But it’s actually much more deeper than it seems
His house is protected by CIA, the assassinator of Russian Ambassador to Turkey was graduated from his schools and his family was members of this organization
They have lots of schools all around Europe and Africa, he has pictures with pope
They bought lots of officials in American senate and in other countries, I think their idea was to reach places Vatican can not in terms of political influence via religion
(as there are huge masses you can control that way) Erdogan benefitted from them as a vote bloc until they tried to overthrow him
And then the witch hunt started
Overall, for a common person its good news
Evil elephants destroy each other and we ants are not harmed
:) One way or another, Erdogan is purging extreme islamists like illuminati mindset from our state and hunts them globally, and they hunt his reputation back
Win/win
By the way, to let you understand the extend of this organization, 6 months ago 2 flight dispatch in a Turkish airline company got fired, and they disappeared within half an hour, all social medias and such
Turned out they were recording whole office talks but forgot 700 gb recording on the office laptop accidentally, they were asking office people whether they like Erdogan or not, or if coup was staged, to further blackmail them to take them in or replace them with another gulenist person
In the recording you can hear them talking about my brother, nah this one is hard to break, he is not talking about politics at all etc etc
So many years past since coup, but they are still all around in every high ranking position
Still makes me afraid like a horror movie
Just look at these dicks
They think he’s a demigod
> He launched military campaign in Syria where Turkish army mercilessly killed a bunch of Kurds
Are you kidding me
The Kurds you are talking about are members of the YPG, which are the Syrian wing of the Kurdish PKK
They are recognized as terrorists by several NATO nations including the United States
The campaign against the YPG was to secure the Turkish-Syrian border against the YPG
Russia only stepped in after Turkey attacked Assad's forces, not the YPG
Even Lindsey Graham, the fiercest critic of Turkey's involvement in Syria, admitted this:
So can you please stop spreading false information and propaganda
> we are witnesses of increasing number of attack on Armenians
Hate crimes happen on both sides
(which you didn't mention) Needless to say they need to stop from both sides
> They might hate him, but he is giving them justification and encouragement with its statements
No, this is just a huge reach
What's giving them the encouragement is the French people standing up
It has nothing to do with Erdogan
Edit: All political parties, including Erdogans opposition and 90% of the Turkish population supported the Syrian operations
> They would say anything that is in their interest
It's not in his interest as Graham is a fierce critic of Turkey as I said
Graham was the one who called all sorts of sanctions on Turkey, may I remind you
How much longer are you gonna deny the truth
At this point, it seems you will just disregard any evidence I post
> We can see with our own eyes how the conflict in Armenia is unraveling
Yes, the occupying Armenian army is losing ground and Turkey and Israel are supporting Azerbaijan to let them do so
You must've forgot we are allies with Azerbaijan
> about Turkeys army in Syria
Well clearly you're reading from some BS media, friend, because nothing you said so far is true
We in Yurop
But now we broke :(

Cities:Sylines
Killing the soul of a city with a great history for the sake of profit is not what I'd call "intense development" but that's not my business
In today's world, skyscrapers are surely needed in some of bigger cities but I think their number should be limited and they need to be built in a way that doesn't harm the overall harmony of the cityscape
Otherwise, as in the case with Wola, it looks very depressing and sad
Who looks at this photo and feels positive, honestly
What is there to like in this
Using cards benefits banks at cost of small business profits
They get a cut on every purchase + they get to lend you money
Also try to go a month without card
You'll likely spend less
Because cards remove association of money with a limited resource
I'm not a fan of cash either
Ideally we should all use debit card like stuff but it should be much more transparent
Sad thing then polish people are still living quite a shitty life
> I do
I love looking outside my bedroom window, and seeing how those skyscrapers in distance are getting taller and taller every day
Feels really uplifting
I can't blame you
Brain damage and full-fledged love for Americanization is a common occurrence in eastern & central European countries which were subjected to Nazi and communist regimes in the span of a relatively short time
Going from one extreme to the other, I guess
I mean not as good then in Netherlands, France or UK
> Because seeing such a striking proof that things are getting better in a place that used to be filled with misery and post-industrial ruins not so long ago, and finding it depressing and sad is a pretty strong indication of that
All I'm saying is skyscrapers kill the soul of cities and they look fucking ugly
This is why I find it depressing and see no correlation between development and skyscrapers
A city can be very well-developed and great in anything without having them, you know
If skyscrapers were a sign of development, believe me, Istanbul would be the best place in the world to live
This new DLC is great
So when they cops "get theirs" they go back to beating down their fellow countrymen in exchange for the rich man's money
The protesters are just a leveraging tool to the police
You guys sure ain't biased
It's so fucking stupid i couldn't even believe the news
I feel so embarassed to other countries because of what this stupid ignorrant man did
And i also want to say that Erdoğan is an shameless dictator for even playing those videos in a rally
As a Turk I'm very sorry for Dutch folks, my prayers go out to you all
Fascism, racism, ignorance and radicalism are the things we have to fight against together, no matter what religion you believe in
P.S: it's said that this terrorist joined a fight in Chechnya and also he's been arrested in Netherlands due to Isis connections but released after a while
I’m surprised
Turks usually don’t commit terror attacks in Europe
Sorry Netherlands
I think this was the last terrorist attack happening in Europe so far
This is in BBC Turkish
Claim given by a Turkish businessman who lives in Utrecht, it still needs a confirmation tho
“Counter-terrorism police reportedly say the shooting "appears to be a terrorist attack".
I only assumed terrorism because of this
It might be wrong though
Vote by darts
Are those
trash bins
> How to irritate **Europeans** with one sentence
> Has Turkey on the map
This will irritate enough people by itself lol
Anyway, there are a lot of things that can trigger Turks
The suggestion that Arabs=Turks is a good one
Most Turks look down upon Arabs and don't like being associated with them
Other quality trolling questions: "I bet you can't drink alcohol in Turkey", (if victim is female +not wearing a headscarf) "You must feel so free here in Europe, you have to wear that headscarf thing whenever you are outside in Turkey"
Suggesting that a Turkish food is actually not a Turkish food but is a Greek/Bulgarian/Serbian/whatever food will also draw angry comments
After a bit of shitstorm someone rational will point out that these countries shared common history under Ottoman Empire so similarities in culinary are to be expected, this answer satisfies the Turks but tends to trigger Greeks/Bulgarians/Serbians/Whatevers this time
Suggesting that Turks still ride camels and most of Turkey is desert is a good trolling method
I've seen people believing the latter a lot so if anyone is wondering, no, there are no deserts in Turkey
Making overused jokes and memes such as "Turkey
DAE Thanksgiving
" and "It's nobody's business but the Turks" and "Turkish prison" may force a facepalm but nothing major
edit: I forgot the best one, the word Constantinople doesn't trigger Turks but when foreigners say it by expecting to trigger us, it just annoys us that you think we are that simple
We have more complex things to get angry about, like food, or someone claiming Anatolia is rightful Armenian/Kurdish/Greek clay or something
edit2: Bringing up Armenian Genocide in online discussion to score an automatic debate win
"yeah but you committed a genocide" *upvoted through the stratosphere*
edit3: If you make a "is it safe to visit Turkey
" thread in /r/turkey, they will rape your karma
edit4: [this is how my national pride looked like after going through my inbox] turkey stronk and relevant im not triggered there is something in my eye :'c

Wait you guys don't like the first two parts
Those are the best parts though
Yeah just added that a few minutes ago
My god we have such a diverse trigger system
Genocide only triggers me if it's brought up in a whataboutist way
Half the threads that mention Turkey, there is at least one comment from some butthurt person saying "Turkey isn't Europe, this shouldn't be here
Gets annoying quickly
I don't know, people seem to have wildly different opinions about it
As a Turk I don't agree with that but I can see why some would
If by partly you mean Thrace then yes I agree
It would make half the population think better of you and other half want to throw you off a cliff
If that's happening in Europe, it's filled with Erdoğan's fanatics so you are more likely to run into an AKP idiot there
Your country disagrees
A lot of Turkish women wear hijab
We call hijab "türban" by the way
To clear misunderstandings, here are some türban photos so we know what we are talking about [1] [2] But wearing türban is not a requirement or enforced by any kind of law
If you want me to give you a percentage
I really don't know
In one city maybe 80% of women wear it, in another city around 20% does
That black ninja outfit though (still can't remember its' name, covers the face and basically every cm of skin) is very, very rare
It's usually Arab tourists wearing that thing
I think it is around 50-50 contrywide but it varies a lot depending on the place
The only actual Ottoman Turkish name for the city is Dersaadet, which is thought to have given by Rum Mehmed Paşa, who was actually a Greek-turned-muslim so there really is no way around a Greek name
And not just Istanbul , most of our city names have greek roots .
It's true, but the government's standing is more complex than that
I am mostly talking about this subreddit
[Look here] What's photographed is literally European soil but there is some butthurt Greek dude bitching about the post
It's annoying to see a bunch of stupid posts at the bottom of every thread
I must admit, I downloaded you without considering the thread we are in and I'll correct my mistake but you realize my statement is factually correct right
> I guess I misinterpreted what you said to mean women would be triggered by the suggestion they wear the hijab and I got confused
But yeah, suggesting they're "forced" to wear it is a legitimate trigger, so long as people are free wear what they like
When I said "you have to wear that veil thing whenever you are outside in Turkey" it was based on a real event
A friend of mine (who wears no burka niqab türban hijab or whatever
maybe bandana sometimes lol) went to Germany one time and someone literally asked "you are forced to wear a hijab in Turkey aren't you
" while she was drinking beer in a bar
She said she was like "wtf" when she heard that
I should have been clearer
Although yes women who wear it are also triggered at the suggestion that they are forced to wear it (even though they are even if they can't admit it, but that's another story)
It should trigger anyone who is a rational human being
It literally means "that big city". Love the Norse simplicity
> It's annoying to see a bunch of stupid posts at the bottom of every thread
Better than seeing them on top
And by nature stupid posts are supposed to be at the bottom
If they are at top then it's time to leave that sub
Yeah it annoys the crap outta me too but you know if someone doesn't make a comment like that, the thread just feels missing lol
Also, downvoted, not downloaded
But I think that may be excused since it is currently 5 a.m. here
And thats why the cat was vibing
The attraction wouldn't persist if the rest of the world looked like that too
It's not the pre-war architecture that attracts people to New York either
The two cities are just unique, each a package of different things
A better way to think about it is the choices you make in constructing a new public building

If I'm not wrong, Navalny is a far nationalist
If it is true, then that means you support a racist
EDIT: Whattttttttttt
Lots of people have downvoted me, lol
If you don't believe me, just go and check yourself
He once said that people of Caucasia are cockroaches
Also he supports annexation of Crimea
Some people say that Navalny is a far nationalist and racist
Of course not, but the problem is Europe supports a racist, ultra nationalist person agains to Putin
It looks like 1930's. In the begining Europe supported Hitler against to Stalin
Have you noticed that they shit white shit on dark  cars and dark shit on white cars

Legacy of colonialism
Edit: Trying to discredit my points below by mentioning the Armenian genocide or Ottoman conquest of Balkans, which don't concern "me", a Turkish individual *at all*, namely using ad hominems, is essentially conceding that my points are all valid and you can't argue against it
People indulging in usage of ad hominems are just either trying to farm karma by "bird country bad" or taking the crimes their countries committed tens of years ago personally, showing an irrational need to defend a malicious practice either they agree with or they are just so indulged in (toxicated) national pride that they can't see the mistakes of the past
Thanks to all people who actually tried to discuss my points

You cant call it summer if it is below 30 degrees
I quit my job and left Estonia last month
It was like 18-20  degrees and even colder in the evening
Now I am melting in Athens but totally worth it
Meanwhile in Turkey one of the cities got 49 degree
I saw 54 too
What the fuck are these recent attacks
How the hell they can just organise so well in the middle of major EU cities
I saw one guy just shooting a defenseless civilian like he's scratching his back, how the hell can be someone so fucked up by whatever he's believing in
I am not an expert but an attack with automatic weapons and multiple terrorists happens without intelligence service noticing can be only explained as sleeping terrorist cells are ordered to attack
This happened in Turkey before, where IS targeted civilians
Fuck terrorists
The world is going mad
Hope everyone is safe but unfortunately ive heard 7 deaths already :(
Some pathetic losers are trying to frame it on Turks, because civilians in Austrian streets spoke Turkish in a clip
The reality is that 400k+ austrians with Turkish origin live and work in Austria
Some local boxers from Turkish origin helped the police against the terrorists
Mods are you going to take action against these  opportunists
This behaviour only causes more polarization among people on this subreddit
I still have the same question: what was the motive
People say it’s islamist extremists but did they officially say that
This is a quote from 2017, he was pissed because some cities and countries didn't allow him to give propaganda speeches in them
It was especially towards Netherlands If I am not mistaken
I am not his supporter or sth but spreading misinformation in such a critical time is a terrible thing to do
You only spread more hate
Thank you for understanding, and stay strong
He is unfortunately like Putin, we cannot get rid of him :(
> And people wonder why the state of israel has to exist and why they have to take such harsh measures, people forget how many hundreds of millions of people still hate jews simply for being jewish
Israel don't get to be cunts just because there are people who are cunts to Jews
It is cool
There is just way too much misinformation being spread by people so it can fit their own agenda
You have probably got baited by twitter
>Trust me the Islamic Jihad for liberation of Palestine, Hezbollah and IICR of Iran aren't fighting Israel because of Palestinian rights, they are fighting Israel because they hate Jews
Which is a damn shame
Secular movements for Palestinian rights have been diluted by Islamism, same as Kashmiri rights in India and Caucasus peoples rights in Russia
I think this comes off as very wholesome because it shows a humanoid side of people in the past

Why do many radical Muslims hate on the values and cultures of the country they immigrate to
Western Europe needs a stricter immigration policy
Why is it that a lot of the Muslims they let in are the radical ones
The whole system needs a revamping
They need to check how this person and his family got to europe and why they were accepted in the first place
So many western secular Turks getting denied of living in europe then you see people like this living freely there and dare to do something like this
Smh
Islam is a religion and also an ideology
Criticizing it is not racism, not even the slightest

Sounds like a weird sex story
Americans can keep their nonsense to themselves, I'm annoyed when they push their Americentric beliefs on to rest of the world
They don't know not everything in US applies to everyone else
You need hollywood to make movies about ESA
How about making it as useful and productive as NASA first
Do you have a counterpart to Hollywood
If not, I don't think you can
112 is ambulance in turkey
Our correct number is 112, 911 directs to emergency services (ambulance)
1€ = 6

It was 43 degrees here two weeks ago
I feel relieved in 36 degrees heat lmao
Haha no in adana (noth of cyprus) its 37 degrees
Libya is literally heat itself so it got copyright claimed
I'm jealous of all these leaders you guys have doing normal human things
They don't look like nouveau riche creeps at all
Meanwhile we got [this]
This is İzmir, the "capital of secularism" in Turkey
Here is approx
5m people and they're here to see the top opposition president candidate Muharrem İnce
Hope for the good of Turkey
Panoramic view
New videos
I was, and am still there, the crowd here is insane
Never saw something like this in my lifetime, this is insane
In the first time since 2013, we have seen hope, this man will save us from the dictator we all hate
UPDATE: After the meeting, I and many more volunteers cleaned up the square and now, we are drinking beers all together while singing the Izmir anthem, everyone here still hyped up and the atmosphere is amazing
Muharrem İnce promised that if he wins, shortly after the election he's going to start visiting European capitals, try to fix the broken relations with the EU and assign an ambassador to Damascus to repair the relations with Syrian government and take back what Turkey under Erdoğan's regime did in Syria
Just those is enough for me to vote for him
Erdoğan can't win the presidency in first turn, I hope İnce will be able to overthrow him in the second
Also there's a high possibility that Erdoğan and AKP will lose the majority in the parliament
As an undergraduate physics student, I hope a physics teacher will be the president
If is there a chance to make this front page, let’s do it in order to get it seen by everyone
Izmir’s population is 4 Million, and there were almost 3 Million people there
Actually in my opinion, Meral Akşener must beat Muharrem İnce in the first round in order to compete against Erdoğan
Because Akşener is a centre-right politician who may easily affect the votes of rightist Erdoğan while getting the support of the leftists because of their anti-Erdoğanism
According to polls she may get approx
53% of the votes against Erdoğan
But who knows, Muharrem İnce is a strong candidate too and he might give us a surprise
Actually, not the head of his party
We like you too :)
He first entered Parliament in the 2002 elections, with the CHP
Looked notably younger - his hair was more, and was black
Anyway, he was always a proper, well-meaning man, with no (or little) scandals to his name
Always said it straight to the AKP, sometimes raging on the podium as the AKP deputies interrupted him all the time
I've supported him to be the CHP leader ever since 2011-2012
The CHP under Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu has turned
more and more unsavoury, to say the least
So, to summarize: He's a folksy physics teacher entered politics, generally a swell fellow, and he's a bit of a maverick within the CHP: Not immensely leftist, not the staunch Kemalist of the Baykal era, basically the closest Turkey gets to a social democrat
And a damn fine one at that
The elections were to take place in 2019, but with some "pressure" from AKP's ally MHP, (right-wing nationalists) it was decided that it was gonna take place in 2018, next sunday
2019 seems like a normal date but if you can match the dots, you will see that many projects, like high infrastructure investments (including several metro lines in Istanbul) are coincidentally planned to be opened just after 2019
This tactic is a very cheap and overused one and I thought they would use it again
But then hit me
Erdogan surely knows that his opponents are the strongest so far, it's all in
So he probably expects the elections to have a second round
I think that's where they will hit opposition the hardest
It is very suspicious that Erdo (compared to his previous elections) played clean and fairly so far
But in the period between the first and second round, that's when shit will hit the fan
He's going to use his infrastructure projects card, his Terrorism card and he is going to play very dirty
As for ballot countings, I plan to stand in my poll station and stare at the officials counting the votes
I will fight them if they make anything wrong
I hope mr
İnce and ms
Akşener are ready for his future strategy because Turkish youth are tired of the cultist-extremist-islamists holding the power and abusing the hell of it
Also, mr
İnce says he will be in the HQ of Elections Institute with an army of lawyers
I hope he will guard our votes
If Erdo once again tries something as cheap as that cat and transformer stuff, I can only hope that Turkish people are not stupid enough to buy that
HDP expressed their support for the candidate against Erdoğan in the second round
But I would not trust it as Kurdish voters are generally conservative and might actually support Erdoğan
He is, but it depends on what Europe means
Yes, the reforms EU asks of Turkey is pretty good, and they should be done so that the country won’t end up a third world country 20 years from now on, regardless of whether EU wants them or not
But joining the EU
I don’t think Turkey has much to gain from it
Turkish economy is around the size of Spain’s already (last I checked, though Spain has half the number of people, so per capita Spain is still higher)
It might be a political goal, and it’s useful to say X, Y, Z is being done for EU membership
But the real gain is the life quality improvements that come from those changes, and EU is just the carrot
I don’t mind joining EU personally, but with so many Turks, at once I understand the criticism, which is completely fair and valid, but at the same time quite hurt with the vessel that criticism is delivered in, which is, “you’re just not one of us, go back to the Middle East where you rightfully belong you camelf###ers”.
Not only Turkey doesn’t have any deserts, it also doesn’t have any camels except those imported from Arabia to appease American tourists
So there’s that
It’s just, you know, 49% of Turkey is exactly like you, me, secular, western, and they already feel like shit about the shape of their country and trying to fix it while apologising about what Turkey is doing right now
Calling Turkey out as a whole based on its current government (which is barely elected) as not one of y’all actually makes people that *are* like everyone here slowly start to decide that they’re just not welcome in that club and move on
For that reason, I read but I don’t even post in r/Europe because I don’t feel super safe here
(Secular Turkish expat living in US)
İstanbul has a very high population
For decades lots of conservative people from the countryside migrated there to find work
You'll find the most modern and backwards people there living together
Its a very mixed bag
I am not very knowledgable about İzmir so other folk can explain that question better
The old IDs had a space on it that indicated your religion, and if you were born into a family that is registered as Muslim you had Islam on your ID as well
It had remained from pre-republic traditions where your religion defined your identity, and there was even a scandal a few years back where citizens of Pontic, Armenian and Jewish descent were still "marked" with the numbers 1, 2, 3 after those labels were removed over time
As far as I know the new IDs don't have them (I actually just came back home and am trying to get one before I leave, because it looks way more legit than the old ones when you're abroad and you need proof of identification when you don't have a passport)
So the 99% figure is definitely unrealistic as only people registered as Christians or Jewish or other religions are registered
You could leave it blank if you'd like by applying to the state, but from what I heard it was an arduous process and it lead to some minor discrimination when dealing with people so most people didn't do it
So a lot of estimates put the actual figure in the 90-95% range for people who call themselves Muslims in any way, and people who practice anything beyond calling themselves that shouldn't be over 50-60%.
I really don’t know
I am and my family is not Muslim but we are also automatically registered as Muslims
In my opinion, the non-believer percentage may be something between 5-10%.
Well it is estimated to be around 90%. Official records assume that everyone (except church/synagogue registered Jewish and Christian individuals) is Muslim unless they go through a ton of paperwork to be counted as non-affiliated
However, the majority of the Muslim population simply identify as Muslim and actually have a non-religious moral code
Turkish people respect their own tradition that passes down from generation to generation rather than the actual teachings of Islam (at least the one that is interpreted by Arabian societies)
If you are to visit some bigger cities you'll often see people drinking at bars which are  usually quite crowded (especially if it's evening or night time) and hear the call to prayer from the mosque at the same time
I know many Turks who drink some days and pray at the mosque during holy days
I don't know any other Muslim majority country that this would be considered normal - maybe except from Azerbaijan (we love you guys
) which is a country that has even more secular (?) population as far as I know
Yes, he has
Have you paid attention
Ending the state of emergency, and having mother tongues to be taught in schools is two
That means that Kurds will be taught Kurdish in public schools, along with many other minorities
His main motto for the foreign affairs is peace with everyone, so I doubt that
It is true that our relations with each other are not the best right now, but please keep in mind that media, especially in Turkey and Greece, can sometimes be on the nationalistic side because of the past
I strongly advise you to not believe the media until this election is settled and statements are made from elected sides
Greek media and politics aren't different from Turkey's in that matter
Create a common enemy to ignore real problems such as economy
Also no one here cares about Greece
I'm not saying no one likes Greece, we just have more important problems such as economy, terrorism and lack of education
No one here dislikes Greece, unlike some vocal minority Greeks I've seen on the internet
>Is the state media talking about the march of is it being ignored
Actually Most of Turkish media is not state owned but mainstream media in Turkey is a like joke and they can't ignore the opposition anymore but  News are full of fake propaganda
All polls suggest huge win for Erdogan and people keep saying opposition has no chance to win
no not really , new system favors the president with wide range of powers
but still, a hostile parilment can be a nice thorn in his side
"Significantly weaker", no
"Seriously undermine his efforts to actually govern the country", yes
For instance, the president can rule by decree, but if the Grand National Assembly passes a law concerning the same subject as a decree, the decree is null and the law is the rule of the day
Needless to say, if the opposition is able to consolidate and actually work together in the GNA, they can be a very, very problematic thing for Erdoğan
Hence, his statement yesterday indicating they "could go for a coalition if they can't reach 300". Ironic, seeing how Erdoğan and his sycophants advertised this new system as putting an end to coalition governments once and for all
Akşener will support and rally for İnce
I'm sure she'll convince some of her right leaning base to vote for him
İnce will also offer Akşener vice presidency
Akşener has a slightly higher chance of beating Erdoğan but İnce is the ideal candidate in my opinion
Secular yet not antagonistic to conservatives, values science highly, looks positively to the West
Also has the man of the people charm, not too elitist
AKP didn't play clean and fair at all
They printed posters that say things like "we will ban headscarf" and put CHP's symbol on them
Aside from this false flag advertising, media still pays much more attention to Erdoğan than others
Erdoğan also said in a meeting that they can "finish the election before it even begins" so at least the guy is letting us know that the election will be rigged to some degree
One of the opposition leaders is in prison even
This isn't a normal election at all
Also, while it's a good idea to guard the ballots, you can't object to legalized fraud techniques
If YSK says unstamped ballots can pass, then unstamped ballots can pass
We should always fight against injustice but things gets tricky when injustice is legal and fighting for justice is not
Unless we buy guns and shoot anyone who tries something funny I don't see how we can stop them from committing fraud
Nationalist and religious votes as well
I don't think Akşener's support by herself will be enough
I seriously doubt that
Central-right voters of the old parties (DYP, ANAP etc) (who are around %15) could support Akşener but they fear CHP so much, they would run back into Erdoğan's arms if İnce becomes his alternative
> Only statistic we do have is, CHP had more Bosniak MPs and more Bosniaks as the official active party members but that also doesn't mean anything for whom the majority of the Bosniaks do cast their votes
And we have that statistic where exactly
The only Bosniak in CHP that I'm aware of was Birgül Ayman Güler and she quit the party few years ago
AKP and MHP have far more Bosniaks in their ranks that I know of
I think the mistake a lot of Europeans make is associating Kemalism to a pro-militarist, or even jingoistic, foreign policy because the founder of the ideology was the leader of the Independence War
Takes some effort - on our part - to explain how Atatürk wasn't jingoistic at all, and instead strove for regional peace every which way he could
> Secular yet not antagonistic to conservatives, values science highly, looks positively to the West
Also has the man of the people charm, not too elitist
Don't you think he is the CHP version of Erdoğan though
Insulting the hotel receptionist, tearing the epaulettes of that general, that silly poem book, that child on the podium the other day
He is gathering the opposition votes for sure, but he is also causing rightists to gather around Erdoğan instead of İnce, out of fear
He has fallen into the trap Erdoğan set up for him, in my opinion
And his supporters are out of mind
Defending the wrongs of him by saying "Erdoğan did it too, why dont you say him anything
" Is this really the way we want our politics work
But how can we blame his supporters when he himself uses the same language
Akşener is the normalizer leader we need in my opinion
For now, at least
You won’t find much disagreement from me for any of those
I’m just sad that what got Hitler and Mussolini elected is still well alive and kicking in 2018 in this old world of ours, after all of us are so well connected to the rest of the world
Turkey should do well to remember, in the very end, we are all Romans
Neither do we need to be, which is my point
A modicum of respect for human rights and democracy is not ‘European values’, it’s *human* values, values which Turkey is failing to satisfy right now
That said, from the fact that you’re writing in Turkish in an international forum tells me that you’re not really interested in an actual discussion, so I’ll leave it at that
I'll add another voice to confirm that Greece is not discussed at all in Turkish politics, just in news, mostly about Tsipras and economic crisis, and usually with some sympathy because you guys are in a really bad position re: more established / economically powerful countries, a position Turkey finds itself in fairly often
I mean, I (and likely most of my generation) really, honestly cannot imagine a world where Greece and Turkey ends up in a military event outside of an unintended accident like a plane crashing or something that happens in Turkey that has nothing to do with Greece (like soldiers escaping the coup want asylum in Greece etc
)  Yeah there are problems, and both Turkey and Greece kind of act like dicks to each other in turns, but ultimately those are gonna be solved sitting on a chair and duking it out via paperwork, not via getting into a shitty situation with another NATO ally
I think the reason that they've not done it yet is that both Turkey and Greece has bigger problems now, not that there's animosity or anything
If anything, Greece is a fairly popular holiday destination within my circle of friends because food/drink/culture it's close enough that you feel safe, but different enough that it still feels exotic and new
A decent portion of Greek cuisine exists as part of the Turkish cuisine, but there are types of Tzatziki (Called Cacık across the shore) that don't exist in Turkey, and stuff like that
So going to Greece to eat is the food equivalent of reuniting with your long lost cousin that you never knew existed
Seriously, the only Turkish invasion you should fear is probably the one that comes with sunscreen and hawaiian shirts
I mean, I'm still a little jumpy when I meet someone that is greek anywhere in the world because I've had some random hostility from them occasionally, but that's becoming less and less of an issue, thankfully
Venizelos didn't nominate Atatürk for the Nobel Prize for nothing
No, no, no
That insult tape was bullshit, and "tearing the epaulets of the general" idea is completely legitimate
A soldier cannot be a partisan, or else he is discharged, end of story
It doesn't matter if that soldier is a hero, or not
He has a duty to not be involved in politics
Children, unlike what many believe, do not have free rein to do as they please
It is the parents' responsibility to keep the child behaving
Contrary to what many Turkish parents would believe, their child is *not* the most precious thing on Earth
There are rules, and good parenting is also teaching your child those societal rules and norms, not allowing your child to tread upon them because you love them so much
İnce does not use the same language
He does not accuse the AKP and MHP voters of being terrorists, for instance, while Melih Gökçek tweets the opposition being terrorists wholesale
He berates Erdoğan, as a person, because frankly, Erdoğan deserves to be berated
He is unqualified, completely inept, and entirely suitable to run a barber shop, not a country
Meanwhile, Erdoğan berates an entire 50% of people
There are similarities, and yet, he is not the CHP's Erdoğan
If he becomes such, the proper democrats of this country will stand up against his wrongs, as well
Right now, getting rid of Erdoğan and his sycophants is the first priority
Akşener, while okay, is far too nationalist for my taste
Either way, I'm fine with voting for whichever one come round two
There is Saffet Sancaklı in MHP
For AKP, not sure about MPs, but Hido is president's advisor and I know of some other people within the party like the last head of youth org
Bosniaks are generally organized within AKP with economic and cultural organizations and so on, but I agree, it doesn't say much about who votes how
Maybe other immigrant groups are more represented in CHP and you extend that to Bosniaks, but I've never heard of a single one in there
I agrrewith your points
What I am against is the language he uses while doing so
Let us remember Erdogan was defending LGBT rights during his campaign in 2002
Hope so, man
If it’s any consolation, even after fifteen years of this stuff, Turkey still defines itself in the context of Europe, for example, the history books that we get taught are almost entirely full of European history (helps that Turkey also plays  a large role in that)
I am reminded of this because I see that you’re from Alsace, we have an entire chapter for this whole Alsace-Lorraine debacle between France and Germany
To graduate high school, I had to write essays on Voltaire, Descartes and Montesquieu
Hell, even the world for high school is “lise”, which might be familiar
because, well, lycee
And even if you think about it - the reason why so many Turkish people feel their country is a shithole is that they compare it to England, Germany, France, not Iran, Iraq or whatever the hell is down south of Turkey
The assumption of what country to compare it to is so implicit that nobody even really consciously thinks about it — Turkey’s cohort comparisons lies in its west, even for its most conservative citizens
So those kind of things, implicit bias, gives me some hope, even the fact that Erdogan is trying SO hard to make it not so for the past two decades and *still* photos like above happen is a testament that Turkey doesn’t really see itself in the Middle East
Time will tell
I’m cautiously hopeful
Fair point, my apologies : )  thanks
I think we can both agree that Turkey was pretty much the worst place to attempt to build a nation state, and that was at best a mixed success
That said, you’re also falling into the same logical hole that you’re blaming the people who built the Modern Turkey 90 years ago — Turkey isn’t western, or non-western, it’s a multitude of things
As you yourself tell, there is no one single Turkey (since you say that Turkey could not be a nation state), but then you make petty ad-hominem arguments about how I am yearning to be European and Western (which I am not, far from it — I think Turkey is best served by being its own thing), implying that your view of Turkey is the only one that matters
I was born and educated in Turkey, I spent majority of my life there, my opinion is just as valid as yours
You want it to be not a western country, fine, you can work towards that, it is a democracy after all
I think it is still, though, so at best, we’ll have to agree to disagree
Honestly, I used to think Turkey wasn’t western when I lived in it
Only when I actually travelled to the non-western world that I realised Turkey is obviously so
You might think you’re so different than a Dane, or a Pole, or an Italian, but compared to a Japanese, a Maori or a Hmong, it is so painstakingly obvious that we are, in the grand scheme of things, bickering over fairly small differences
Nevertheless, my advice would be to travel more
No thoughts at all
Cypriot Turks are doing hell of a better job at trying to fix the situation than Turkey, they will likely be the ones to solve it
Turkey has been fairly uninterested in that problem for the past 20 years beyond ensuring the survival of the Turkish half
Cypriots Turks consistently elect anti-Erdogan candidates (I think)  so I have some hope, but I wish turkey did some more pushing and prodding to make both sides come to an actual conclusion
Turkish side of Cyprus is much more liberal than mainland Turkey and it shows
It would be unthinkable if Cypriot Turks wanted to join the southern part under a given deal, that Turkey would say no
Not only it would cause an international outroar, it is also not Turkey’s decision to make
Northern Cyprus is a fairly separate country that TR isn’t all that happy to be bankrolling to the tune of USA bankrolling Israel, considering the economic size difference of USA and TR
My friend,keep in mind ,greece had a sizeable turkish minority,that also had to leave their homes
and it all started with greek adventure in asia minor following WWI
I’m *not* going to get into who killed more who committed what atrocity when etc
at all after this comment
Because thats not my point
However, as someone with family from Selanik I very well know that the story is two sided and no it does not get personal when I visit Greece
I also know that the Aegean aide of Turkey and Greece is so similar that its hard to hate each other that much
Every single one of them are Biden's spies it's so obvious
Wet European dreams
Jesus, some people take everything face value
I have the ultimate source
Sputnik is a wonderful newspaper haha
What did Georgia do lmao
Can someone explain how and why Turkey isn't on the list
Like we're fighting against Russia in 3 wars and if they attack Ukraine it will be 4
How we're not in this list
Thought this was posted on a Balkan subreddit first
Also, I want to ask: How could this affect Russia or Bulgaria
Where do we submit the form
Let me in
LET ME INNNNNNNN
“shit weather” cracked me up lmao
I always saw them as the most civilized nation that borders my country Turkey
Lol
We won in Armenia, we're doing good in Syria and Libya
Ahh Radegast
One of the best beers in the world in my opinion
I missed that taste so much
Wish it was available in my country also
I wouldn’t miss any excuse to drink 1 more like they did
>226 voted no
Wow that's a lot of no votes
I was expecting this to pass unanimously
And therefore very gorgeous
Well I don't but I had the impression that there wasn't a big opposition against gay marriage in Germany
Jesus christ Slovakia
I would like to have seen this before 9/11, and even before and after WW2
Just to see how much history dictates peoples point of view on different races
huehuehuehue
Hide yo daughters hide yo jobs
Wow
Just wow
AFAIK It's because of a scandal in CSU and a leadership battle in SDP
Not sure if this support stays with them
It's unnatural to get this much support in such short time anyways
What is the ideology of Green Party ?
Oh, I didn't know that
I am Turkish so I don't really follow German politics but last week Cem Ozdemir made an interview with a Turkish journalist and I listened about the situation from him
I think just saying 'no' to refugees and having to accept them anyways due to lack of constructive policies is really popular in right-wing circles
Turkey was bored from all the Middle East bullshit so they left
Real European map, no Turkey, not a single soil of it, but half of russia, that's the logic we should all have
Still no transitria
Is that Mississippi with 11
I wish
Nobody asked me, but if you will ask, I think Turkey belongs to Middle East geographically
Just my humble opinion
But if we look culturally, Turkey lost many their values they bring from Asia, and now Turkey is like rainbow about culture, you can see small world in Anatolia
Anyway my English is bad, but I hope you got it
Then just include the European side to the map
Yes
Edit: Actually you don't need that, you can add it anyway if you want
As you can see there are some grey countries on the map without any data
Same can goes for Turkey as well
Meditterenaen is hot
Some parts of turkey are colder than some parts of scandinavia
Marginally but still, nice
middle east is just fucking black
Oh no, pufferfishes are coming
Mediterranean guys we are all gonna die
Fuck
Why Turkey looks so tired
Shit, I did not notice Belarus changed the color of their flag
I was thinking its white and red till now
Here we go again
is this a kind of modern art
Well, thats a shame
Damn, i thought you were remembering the soldiers died fighting against the Spanish
If Turkey was in list, it would be on top
So brave
Half of them from Europe

Are you trying to spell "Umbridge"?
Haha we are far from modern now
It's fine, I just wasn't sure if it was a Harry Potter reference or some other joke that I didn't get
People in Northern Cyprus have Cyprus/UK passports so they're fine
Estonia's situation was explained in another comment
Crimeans were given Russian passports by Putin
Does ARM count as "European"? Because they are the biggest in phones
Excuse me guys but I'm Turkish an don't get it
I can only see ordinary German and Dutch people in the picture, where is the joke
Quick, get that baby out of there
Greece and Turkey, made a big smile on my face :)

THEY ARE TAKING OVER TROY

Much love Hellas <3
Yes homo
This was /u/anarcht 's idea at first and I spread it over /r/turkey and in /r/place
Yet no one gives us two the credit; when two subreddits were at war
Still
I believe we as two subreddits accomplished something beautiful today
Hopefully, more to come
We did it Reddit
r/wediditreddit
This is how similar Turks and Greeks are according to cultural psychology;
Source;
Comments at the bottom almost made me hate humanity
tbh
politicians act more friendly towards each other than the people
What's the reality
That Greeks/Turks wake up every morning thinking "dayum, what a fine day do remove kebab/gyro"?
What reality
Turks and Greeks do not hate eachother
Greeks hate Turkish goverment though then again who doesn't?
γεια!
The griefers were T_D afaik
[Please] we are the number 1 in oversized dictator palaces but at least Putin's is prettier
You think that's enormous
Wait until you see ours
Erdoğan's is bigger
You call that enormous
You really should check out ‘Ak Saray’ (White House in Turkish)
It is the Presidential Palace of Turkey
It costs 4 times more than the actual White House in the US
For comparison, US’s GDP is 21 times larger then Turkey’s.
I truly hope you guys can achieve what we couldn't;
Much luck, neighbors

That's a nice tv
i love the bunny paintings though
I thought it's a shoot from Bannerlord
Well that's nice
I hope they actually do some useful things like using more nuclear energy and reduce the fossil fuel usage
Well that's nice
I hope they actually do some useful things like using more nuclear energy and reduce the fossil fuel usage
Well that's nice
I hope they actually do some useful things like using more nuclear energy and reduce the fossil fuel usage
Well that's nice
I hope they actually do some useful things like using more nuclear energy and reduce the fossil fuel usage
As far as im aware nuclear has the lowest fatality rate out of all the energy sources
"The risk" is significantly lower in modern reactors than the older ones, which already had low risks to begin with
As for the cost, nuclear powerplants are expensive to build but really cheap to run
In the long run they are the most cost effective amongst the clean energy sources
And the solution he presents is not avaible in a lot of countries
It is mostly available to countries that have coasts to the oceans
Im pro-renewable but we should replace the fossil fuels with nuclear first to minimize the enviormental damage
Well, i don't really have any numbers to back it up right now to be honest, but with a little digging im sure we could find some
But anyways nuclear powerplants cost at least few billion dollars to build, this is why people think they are expensive at first
But the thing is, uranium that is required to run the powerplant is relatively cheap
And it takes a long time for a reactor to be in need of new supplies of fuel
This makes a nuclear powerplant cost effective in the long run
Why is that not a solution
As far as i know an underground depot with thick lead walls can pretty much keep all the radiation inside
If there is a leakage problem then we can find a solution like creating a huge nuclear waste storing room in a certain unhabited area like in the middle of the sahara desert or something
Why is it being radioactive for long is a problem
They can stay in an underground room for thousands of years
And it's not like we are out of space or anything
And im sure we can find other was like dumping them to space ect later on
Renewables are not yet good enough to replace the fossil fuels
And nuclear energy is the only possible solution right now
It is far better than fossil fuels
Would you rather have poisonous materials on our atmosphere or buried deep in a sealed room in the middle of a desert
It doesn't have more side effects than fossil fuel that's for sure
We are already in for a catastrophic change
But it's still manageable
If we don't immediately stop our fossil fuel usage it is going to have terrible effects for our future generations
And renewables are simply not replacing fossil fuels fast enough
It is no time to be indecisive
In future they can replace fossil fuels, but the thing is we must do something NOW
Even if we stopped all our carbon emissions today, we would feel the effects for the next 1000 years
The situation only gets worse by each passing second
We should uss nuclear instead of fossil fuels and then try to replace them with renewables later
Oh by the way, there already hundreds of nuclear powerplants, especially in France there are plenty
But they are obviously well protected
Im giving you the example of France because if they had any problems, you would feel the effects as well
But it seems that they are pretty safe so far
TIL I live in a desert
Just kidding, great work
Looks perfect  ️
Why half of Anatolia is desert
In Turkey , deserts are just a %1 of all country
Excellent work but I must tell you that Anatolia is way more green than this
Turkey
Not
A. Desert
Country
chile
not you making turkey a desert country
they are gonna drag your ass lmao
(To be honest you should've researched better
Still an amazing job though
The rope in northern Cyprus hahaha
Color choices for Spain and Turkey could be better but other than that, amazing
It’s steppe
9 in turkey
I had over 35 kids in my class
I am calling BS for Turkey
I know children 5 years younger than me had classes of 50 people
I am sure nothing can change this fast
Turkish here
During 1st grade (2001) our class was 60 (wtf)
Anyways, I earned scholarships from some private schools; switched to one of them
They had 10 students in a class, and there were 4 classes total
It puts things in perspective
Those who study at state schools don't really have much chance to learn stuff :(
When i was a first grader in turkey we had 40 children
In İstanbul average is probably between like 40 to 50
In my time my class was 48 and it should have gone up
It's lower when you take the averages of the whole country because other provinces are at a lower population density
Same goes for all countries I'd imagine
Yeah, that's pretty accurate for Turkey
yep, i visited some schools in Istanbul recently and most had 40~ students per class
however i think village schools are a big game changer here (smaller village schools may have 6-7 students per class) ~~and temel liseler, having often less than 20 students per class
edit: forget about the temel liseler, map says primary education
Primary ed tho
I used to watch its cartoon in my childhood
It was so good
Also Turkish dub of Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra was so funny
Turkish translations were splendid
Asterix, Spirou and Fantasio, Lucky Luke, Tintin, I read them all when I was young
My mother threw them all away because she thought it was just garbage
She is always throwing something important away lol
edit: BTW we call Lucky Luke 'Red Kit' for some reason I don't know
Young male adult from Turkey
Had "Asterix : Tour de Gaule" and "Asterix : Legionarre" in my childhood, both in Turkish
I can say that my decades old love for sandals can be traced back to those books
(maybe in some weird psychoanalytical way, because I was afraid of being bullied so much when I was a kid, I somehow identified myself with the Romans who consistently got punched out of their sandals and were terrified by the sight of the Gauls, and adopted the sandal as a part of my meek identity)
We had it in Turkey
I remember watching the movie as a teenager
It was fun actually
But never heard about comics
That Turkish dub was awesome
Laz architect accent was a genius idea
Ferdi Sayışman was a famous calligrapher and did the lettering for many comics around that time
He says that when they decided to publish *Lucky Luke* in Turkey in the mid 1950s, they wanted to use their own name for the character, and adopt the 'Red' from [*Red Ryder*] and 'Kit' from the title character of [*The Adventures of Kit Carson*] both famous Western stories of the time
Thus Red Kit was born
Moreover, Luke's dog Rantanplan was a parody of the famous dog Rin Tin Tin, star of [*The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin*] another Western series
So they removed the parody angle and named the dog Rintintin
Today Rantanplan is arguably more famous than Rin Tin Tin in most of Europe, including Turkey, where he is known as Rintintin
There is a stereotype in Turkey about all architects being Laz
So while every character in the movie speaks with perfect İstanbul Turkish, they had that Egyptian architect guy speaking with a Laz accent
And Laz accent sounds funny to us İstanbullers
Also the dubbers were just talented which is something hard to come by
It seems someone studying [Non-Euclidean Geometry]

What's happening in Azerbaijan
Turkey surprised me
Can you share the source of it
Therefore, maybe we can learn reasons of suicides
Turkey and Greece be like "Why kill ourselves when we have baklava
My psychiatry professor said that usually men prefer aggressive methods while women prefer more non-lethal ones and it's really hard to get a gun license in my country
She said something like men would consider a failed suicide attempt as a weakness while women suicide attempts would be a cry for help or a chance for secondary gain
Not always, mostly depends on cause of the attempt
If it's an impulsive attempt with sudden emotional changes than they regret their choice, see their attempt as a chance and usually accept help immediately
However, if it's a planned attempt with major depression or depression linked mental health problems, then they might see their attempt as failure and be dissappointed in themselves
These ones may take more convincing to take help, and riskier for repeating attempt
Well he's the host, he should be responsible for the oven
In 2k18, every political cartoon is either simple as "Orange man bad" or it's just an overlabeled piece of crap
Show who pays the most
In Turkey we have around 75% taxes on beer at the moment
Basically the movie"purge"
What a coincidence that we have the same color as Greece
i mean peacekeeping is really the sugarcoated version of being partners in a war
i was watching bbq videos throughout the whole europe you notice southern parts throw tomatoes as side while northern parts roast potatoes on charcoal so interesting
You shouldnt put turkey
All of our food is export even though we have agriculture
Where is the turkey ,  bitch  !
Happy birthday Polan
Heh
Noobs
All jokes aside, I think this is terrifying
Yes, I'm sure Poland had very hot summers, say, a century ago as well but what we currently have is very clearly something else
People living in eastern & central Europe literally talk about camping at work to avoid the effects of heatwave or complain about not being productive
In other words, Europe is already a tough place to live in and it's not even July yet
That sounds really, really bad
Luckily for me, this summer has been unusually wet and cool here but we as human beings around the world are getting really fucked
Can Europe sue America, specifically the American Republican party
I can give anything for that god damn i really dont like summer speacily if you are in city like fucking Istanbul its just worst

I miss paczki
During my time in Poland, everytime I would walk to uni and see this little bakery that was making premium quality paczki and I would be giving it to myself as a treat
There was Auchan where I could buy them for cheaper and just as amazing with different sorts of filling
I would always buy them whenever I visited that supermarket
Even though I know they aren’t the healthiest thing around, I just have a fond memory of them
Happy Fat Thursday
Happy heart attack day !
I made them once but it took me 4 hours and a half with all the waiting time
I’m not sure if the process it that long usually but I’d love to make them in a shorter time cause I get excited to eat them as soon as possible
Bread making machine idea is great though, thank you :)
The reason as to why American cars aren’t as “good” as European, specifically German cars has more to do with geography than you think
To put it simply, because America is vast and open it’s roads are mainly straight
Because of this, refined and nuanced handling as a result of more sophisticated suspension design isn’t stressed
Also because of that same reason the cars can of course be bigger and have more un, or improperly sprung weight
The American geography lends itself from getting from A to B as fast as possible and the large displacement tradition of American power-plants reflect this
Whereas in European cars the ability to navigate the tight, narrow and winding roads that were mostly built before cars is preferred and European cars reflect this
Additionally America has this sort of machismo, “authentic” every-man, anti-intellectual, anti-elegant thread that runs through it’s culture; there is a heavy correlation between that attitude in America and where in America the roads run straightest as well
> US multinationals
You realize that this is an oxymoron yes
Who owns these multinationals
It's German pension funds, Chinese billionaires, Qatari Emirs, etc
Of course American billionaires, pension funds and small private investors probably own quite a bit of these companies too, probably a bit more than foreigners, but the same american investors also hold shares in companies founded and headquartered in Europe
Same

And europeans sometimes dare to use the word “brainwashed by propoganda” when I am arguing
This is pathetic
Wait europe really think we are terrorists - turkish man
although ill be affected i wanna see how our govt reacts if we get sanctions, go towards china
I'm done with this boycotting shit, it only related Erdogan but not Turkey
Most of the Turkish people don't do anything regarding it
EU has no idea about what's really going on Turkey but has endless prejudices about everything in here, broad your perspectives, not always Erdogan means all the Turkish people
This sanctions only help erdo
He blame eu for our economies crush
How the fuck you guys connect Turkey with the terrorist attack on France
Go back to 4chan
Turkish society is pretty good rn tbh
The effects of religion is diminishing
In few decades, there will be no religious influence in the politics
What violence
Just because he called Macron an embecile (which he is) and reminded us that we can boycott France doesn't sound violence to me
There are tons of proofs that there weren't any war crimes but
The number of religious people is decreasing like hell in the new generation because of Erdoğan's policies
It really backfired bad in his side
Even religious young people don't care about religious side of politics
>rather than call out terrorists who beheaded a school teacher
We did send support before and after calling for boycott
Even our ministry of religion send their condolences
What would you want us to do
Doing nothing after a French clown publicly disrespect us
By projecting the prophet on building
Isn't that disrespectful
>Turkey has funded terrorism in Xinjiang forever and Erdogan has been on attack mode also forever

I'm surprised İstanbul isn't yellow - Ankara I know is a bureaucrat city and thusly has very high educational attainment, but I'd have thought that most istanbullu at least finished high school
Turkey doesn't look accurate
What
The
FUCK
Oops
Ankara will stand alone
Not much surprising
Except for Germany
It's obligatory secondary education process in Turkey
So the map is totally seeming weird tbh
As for tertiary in every cirty has university in Turkey
Not every university is high quality but people are undergoing a tertiary education
Ne cahil milletiz amk,ondan sonra Europe bize niye sövüyor

map is probably wrong istanbul and western anatolia has to be at least yellow

Thats literally factually incorrect lmao
It’s not mandatory to vote as far as I know
Despite that, around 80% of the population does end up voting (that was the number at a fairly recent election)
Not a lot of people don’t vote
I mean maybe like 20-30 years ago, but honestly the CHP voters today are the Turkish tourists you see in Greece ever year
Reminds me of Gezi love to Belarus
Keep going strong
Carry water and food for you and your compariots and don’t forget gas masks and eye protection even sunglasses are good
Brexit is done turn this into a win don’t get lost in the past
Erdogan might be shit on a lot of matter but he started a lot of good things going for Turkey too
When we get rid of him we plan on keeping that stuff
For example he started nationalising our military equipment and we can definitely keep that and start building over it
After he is gone and we are not actively being hated by half of the world we can sell that military stuff you know
Our drones are not worse than American drones right now they are making us loose money tomorrow when Erdogan is gonna Ukraine can buy couple of them
At the end of the day not buying but making your own will be more profitable in the long turn
Right now we have to pay for catching up and it’s a large sum but after that we will be able to produce our own and overall spend less on military equipment
Potential to sell will always be there even if we don’t it’s still better for us
You know we are already selling drones to Pakistan and Tunisia right
By when Erdogan goes away we will sell I meant we will sell to a much wider market I didn’t mean that we are not already selling some of our nationalized equipment
Right now they might be quite expensive but on the long run we will profit
While USA develops equipment by standing on previous technology we have to develop technology from zero but after few year a decade two we will also have something to stand on
Program overall until now costed us 200 million we sold 6 of Anka-S to Tunisia for 240 million dollars
Sure Switzerland incredible example for why Turkey shouldn’t produce their own equipment
Turkish tanks should not be international sales hit It’s enough if they can compete with tanks from other nations
As I said if we keep developing our own stuff and it becomes as successful as the drones I see nothing wrong with continuing
I don’t see why tank project or helicopter can’t be as successful as our drone project
I’m not against licensed production in areas where we will loose too much money and yes Turkey does plan on becoming major power one way or another
As I said we are already profiting in our drone project which had total investment of only 200 million dollars and we sold only 6 of the damn things already in the green
Also by nationalizing I don’t mean entirely government owned rather owned by government and Turkish private companies
There is state of emergency (thats what tureng told me) so this is expected
Not saying its right but not just gay people nobody can do protest in Turkey right now
While there is the chance that it may be banned if it suits the government, it really isn't a political issue in Turkey
As in nobody ever talks about it
80&#37; of turkish **voters ,** Most of Turks don't even vote for Turkish elections
Two things:
AKP got %50,5  and MHP 7% of the votes from Denmark, definitely not 80%.
The participation rate in Denmark is %34
So, only 17% of the population actually voted for them
Majority didn't care enough about the election to vote
Not to defend homophobes, but in Turkey tear gas and otherwise police brutality is the reaction to dissidents and protesters in general, not a specific reaction to a gay pride march
Basically nobody however Erdogan is trying to bring ottoman Turkish to schools so we'll see what happens in the future
Not many but more than you'd think
A great number of people can read arabic text, but they didn't take Arabic language and grammar lessons (for religious reasons
) Since it's Turkish in Arabic alphabet one in five people can understand it I guess
But this map has really archaic words it feels more arabic than turkish
Arabic script is somewhat phonetical and there sound that sound like each other
Match the similar sounding ones and unfortunately throw the rest away (e. g. No vowels) . Thank God we switched to Latin script which covers all the sounds in Turkish
Here is the full alphabet:
a (â) b c ç d e f g ğ h ı i j k l m n o ö p r s ş t u ü v y z
nephew delet this
>  A great number of people can read arabic text,
A great number ~ 0
1% of the society if not lower
1 in 5 is absurd
Just knowing Arabic alone won't allow you to read Ottoman as far as I know and and 1 in 5 people absolutely cant speak Arabic in Turkey
I was talking about this map only, it's a misunderstanding on my part
Any Turk who can read Arabic alphabet will see basic names like Avrupa, Bahr-ul Hint etc

This makes it seem like Istanbul doesn't have many people lol
This map doesn't convey magnitude, at all

>Turkey
Turkish cities are way way more compact than European ones - Look at İstanbul
We don't have suburbs
They’re literally a member of EU
Dude this “what if”s are even more pointless than denying Cyprus is in Europe
I think you should look up the definiton of European: “relating to or characteristic of Europe or its inhabitants
” Cyprus is European by this definiton
Burundi or Congo are whatever African or Asian country you will bring up are not
And before you bring up Australia again, no they’re not European by this definiton
They’re indeed a part of the Western culture but not exactly European, these two differ
Perhaps don’t speak so certain about these fuzzy concepts before you at least use Google
You’ll just look silly
Like come on what next, denying Germany is Europe
Man, can you drop the Australian subject please
I believe you’re better than this
Australians’ origins are European yes, so are Americans’ and so are South Africans’. But they came to a point where they built their own identity over their European roots
Not even mentioning %100 of their land being in different continents, thousands of kms away from Europe
You can differenciate this easily when you think, please stop acting like there’s no difference between Australia and Cyprus in the sense of being European
If you’re going to accept only the roots of nations as their cultural definiton of today, let’s just accept we all are Mesopotamians and live in peace hm
And if you think Cyprus isn’t Europe because it’s only 80 km away to Asia, just wait till you find out Israel is in Eurovision
The problem is you’re assuming the continent when people are mentioning Europe
Europe isn’t only a geographical term, but also a political and cultural one
You’re confusing “continental Europe” and “Europe”. For example, countries such as Bosnia and Kosovo are in Europe, continentally
But they’re not exactly European as they don’t share cultural and religious values with European countries
> Are you saying Israel is in Europe cause it is in Eurovision
I’m just telling you that European sphere of cultural influence is wider and works differently than you think and goes a little bit beyond the continental Europe
Not as far as Australia though, before you bring it up again
This is like the 4th time I’m explaining meanings of Europe in this single thread
Can you at least try to understand rather than debating for the sake of debating
> So countries like USA and Canada are kinda European as they share religious values (christianity)
So they should be on such maps
i’ll just quit this debate
In Turkey we have 2 poles for what we think over Brits, one side things they are the masters of evil, they control everywhere and every conflict, the puppeteers of America and the real threat is deep british state
The other side is pro British, we think that British are one of the only allies in Europe, at least a neutral ally, not hostile ally like Greece etc
It feels like almost Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria, Greece etc are one pact, British, Spain and all others are another
Maybe it’s because we don’t hear Brits trying to comment over our internal things and urge us this and that and no sanctions and shit
How come %3  British don't know about Ireland ?
Its literally right next to you
It is funnier then you think the number is lower for Norway, Sweden
etc
I love how random some of these are, genuinely made me laugh when I saw that %12 hate Moldova
They call themselves Great Britian , but even they are scared of the might of Albania
Feels weird knowing that Turkey is known more than Russia and Netherlands
After all those anti-Turkish brexit posters, it's really a shock for me to see that amount of positive opinions
TIL turkey is more well known than germany in england
I thought we would be head-to-head with Russia
I'm a bit surprised tbh
Is it possible to not heard of Russia
Wow that was hurtful
I had a very positive opinion of Estonia
Then I watched the movie Klass
Even though I am in Latvia now the sight of a group of teenagers makes me feel uneasy
No idea why a single movie hit me so hard but it destroyed me when I first watched it probably almost ten years ago
It’s in your blood, embrace it
Destroying even the god’s trust is also erotic appeal
I wouldn’t mind Brit rule, at least there would be some sort of class and lots of real football
(not pussy ass football these germans, italians, and french try to pass around)
I don't agree with the way you communicate your message but really, how is expecting the citizens of a country to speak the language of that country is nationalism
I see this being done to Turks all over Europe, they receive a lot of backlash for having Turkish signs, living in all-Turkish neighborhoods and speaking only Turkish
Should I say to the German/French/Dutch etc people that they are nationalistic
They are right, they should learn the language and integrate
With this logic a lot of French people are nationalistic as they have a strong "This is France, speak French" approach
Bro how do you get groceries
Someone's gotta ask the important questions
That's so beautiful

I don't know which language is this, but it's too clear to understand
Idk
Corny
It's mostly basic English, no way 97% of the Netherlands speaks English
My dad claims to speak English, but I know the extent of his skills and believe me it's not very impressive, I assume it's the same with most other countries
The gap between the U.K. and the rest of Europe however does exist
Good idea
For Turkey, primary foreign language is English, followed by German
In fact, there are more people speak German amongst elder people than those speak English as a result of German being the primary foreign language in schools until 80s/90s. There is a relatively big group of francophones since we have French schools in most of the major towns
And of course you can find people speak Arabic fairly easily
Did not include Kurdish as I don’t consider it as a foreign language, it is the mother tongue of ~15% of our population
That's really amazing

Living in Turkey and Erdoğan is the worst leader I have ever seen
He ruined Turkey in two decades
I hope he will lose elections
As a Turk I love this
Sen niye yüzmüyon lan
For all Europeans to know, especially with his decreasing popularity, sanctions and harsh actions against Turkey would work only for Erdoğan
He's on the way to his own downfall
Nobody anticipates him to win another election, even if he does, his majority votes will be gone
He yearns for a new enemy and a new source of agitation
His voter base are just fucking imbecciles who would fall for his ''EU can't handle our swag and trying to block our glorious facts, you see what I'm dealing with here
Destabilising an already suffocating Turkey won't serve nobody, least of all to Europe
Politics isn't that simple
Erdoğan is real football player
Who is that Pókemon
I don't understand why do europeans want to sanctions on Turkey ? Turkey isn't a threat for European Union if you compare Turkey and European Union
