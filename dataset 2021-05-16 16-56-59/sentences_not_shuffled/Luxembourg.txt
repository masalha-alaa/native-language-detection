Luxembourg only became a secular state in 2014 and one of our mayor papers was primarily owned by the archdiocese until very recently
Fair point, but a lake in the middle of the sea would be a bit of a waste
I was just about to suggest Belgium so we would have access to the sea, but am changing my choice to France
Smaller coast for us but we get to keep fries
Bit of a hike for Switzerland, isn't it
Tbh we have the recipe for fries, so ...
Um, excuse me ... Can you not all decide to flood us
We have not hurt anyone recently
Plus we have your money hostage
My mom is Belgian and my aunt owns a friterie in Belgium, what do you do now, my family can just take over the entirety of Benelux with that knowledge
OK this is true
Bit hard to flood Scotland, tho
Free public transport
Pretty big thing
Free public transport, I'd say is progressive
Honestly nobody even paid for tickets for years, so it isn't nothing new if you ask me
He's as useless now as he has always been
2-3 years ago there was some ad campaign for charity
Picture of a homeless guy and the text said something like: Poor Paul only gets 4000 (four thousand) euros per month, lets donate to help him and people like him
Minimal wage roughly is half that for qualified workers and 1/3 for non qualified
Hm well people either living in really small flats in the southern cities or northern, working from morning to evening only earning the minimum wage, getting heavy support from the central government or else they most likely will have a really rough time at the end of the month
If you are lucky you live in an apartment which is not too hot in the summer and easy to keep warm in the winter
Sadly many live in really old houses or apartments which need renovations but they lack the money to do it
Luxembourg
I can find the flairs but they don't stick on me for whatever reason
Did I miss some instructions or what
I don't really care about my accent
My SOs have said it's cute, native speakers understand, what else one may want
The beautiful thing about English is that even people who have learned only the very basics and have an accent still can be understood
Unlike, for example, French where you make one easy mistake and all sense goes out of the window, even native speakers don't understand, let alone two beginners trying to talk between themselves
Native English speaker here, I find your accent to be absolutely adorable and I wish you felt more comfortable with it
in luxembourg almost everyone has an iphone but i don’t think it’s representative of europe
Same, still have the 3T, but I have been wanting to upgrade for some time now
However all the new models are so ridiculously expensive that I will probably just keep me 3T
Exactly, and as you said, OnePlus is also not exactly cheap anymore:(
Esch-sur-Alzette
Known as the poor, drug, gang and criminal city of Luxembourg
Even though it is not that bad
Please add Bonn
It was overwhelming underwhelming
I was shocked considering it was the former capital of Westgermany
There’s a lot worse in Luxembourg like wayyyy worse
Ettelbruck, Rodange, Petange and Differdange are way worse imo
Lol nah it is the poorest Region in Luxembourg with one of the highest unemployment rate but yeah peasants indeed XD
Uh no
Out of all communes only Reisdorf has more people without a job than Esch
And Reisdorf is really small so
And none of those you mentioned are worse than Esch
Granted Differdange has some social problems too but it is not even close to Esch
Even Ettelbrück, often known as the nordic Esch has waaaaay less problems than Esch
That has way more to do with the demographics of the city rather than the city itself
Edit: Following your logic New York is way worse than North Dakota because it has a higher unemployment level
Source:
Hello it is PERCENTAGES
Not total numbers
Or how would a little commune like Reisdorf has more unemployment than Esch
This is ridiculous
DEMOGRAPHICS dude, not just the number of habitants
Damn
Over 14% of the people in Reisdorf are unemployed, so out of 100 there are around 14 people without work
It is followed by Esch, then Differdange etc
So in Esch there are more unemployed people within 100 than for example Differdange
Another statistic:
2018 Canton Esch unemployment : 7
20%
Esch: 10
10%
Differdange : 8
56%
Dudelange : 6
75%
Pétange : 7
33%
Now tell me how are those Cities and Town worse than Esch
Both in absolute numbers and percentage
Ok now I get it
You don’t know what demographics are
Let me give you a fairly simple example
Esch is one of the cities in Luxembourg with the youngest population
For various reasons (systematic and non-systematic) young people have a hard time finding a job
Thus Esch has one of the biggest unemployment rates which is extremely related to its demographics rather than its infrastructures and/or governance
Now you can agree or not up to you, I don’t really care
Consider this my last message already spent way too much time on this
Edit: basing the quality of a city on its unemployment rate will severely restrain your possible conclusions
Stay stafe
No Differdange and Pétange has a younger population than Esch while only Dudelange has a little older population by an average of merely 1-2 years
Demographic doesn't play a significant role to consider it a possibility
And thanks you stay safe too
Ah yes I can cofirm
I see you are a man of culture as well
Fun fact, there is a region called "Province de Luxembourg" in Belgium, which has the exact same eblem as the grand duchy of Luxembourg
The province de luxembourg is even bigger than Luxembourg
It used to be a part of Luxembourg, but because they were french speaking they became a part of belgium
In the last few years it was discussed to hold a referendum in the province because a lot of belgiums in the province want to be a part of luxembourg, because the province is very poor and because of the political instability in belgium
But Luxembourg was like "Nah fam we re good", because it would have cost too much and of course we didnt want to get our neighbour into political trouble
Yeah but just imagine those belgiums would have actually voted to be a part of the grand duchy, this would have triggered a chain reaction
After this belgium would have probably fell apart
Luxembourg : The one member that keeps everyone together when everyone looses theirs minds
Also Finances
The Rich guy that drives to work in a supercar only to steal his coworkers lunches there
They want to strategically reopen all public schools by May 18
The classes will be divided into two and only one half of the students will go to school and the other one will stay at home doing revision
We have to retake all the tests from the first semester and the first half of the second semester
What’s also bizarre is that they allow the children to not wear masks inside the school building, because the risk of affection is lower apparently
Luxembourg is the only country (EDIT: With Liechtenstein) which was part of the Holy Roman Empire and the German Bund that never became part of the German Reich or the BRD
Luxembourgish is only spoken by 300k people, and eventough its the official language here, its not an official language in the EU
Luxembourg banned everything that looked and sounded too german out of our language after WW2
Luxembourg had a mighty fortess that was called "Gibraltar of the north". It was never conquered but in 1867 we had to destroy it because it nearly lead to a war between the european powers
The Church and the state werent seperated until 2015
The catholic church used to be very powerful they owned the biggest newspaper (luxemburger wort) until 3 months ago
Bonus: We still call the german prussians
Even our politicians call them prussians but only in unofficial speeches
Last existing Grand Duchy
All public transport is free
We won the Eurovision song contest 5 times (3rd best) and we haven't participated since 1994
The Schengen area is named after a pretty insignificant Luxembourgish town at the crossing of our borders with France and Germany where the treaty was signed
ArcelorMittal has its headquarters in Luxembourg making the worlds largest steel producer essentially Luxembourgish
The beams for the New World Trade Center were cast here
We have our own language and don't all speak German like some assume
In total we learn at least four languages at school, Luxembourgish, German, French and English
Wanted to get that out as well
I never knew about 5 what the fuck
>44% of individual income goes to taxes
Isnt this normal
Or is this the case for every income class
In Luxembourg the lower classes pay less taxes but the higher classes have to give 50% of their income away
Yes it is
Ita like serbian and russian, they are similar but at the same time quiet different
My Gf is from serbia and she said that she isnt able to have a conversation with a russian but she is able to guess the topic when she reads russian
Its the same for german and luxembourgish
Germans have a hard time to understand anything that we speak (they often confuse it with dutch) but they can guess the topic when they read luxembourgish
Wow you totally right dude
Ive never tought about this
In school we actually learn that we are the only country
Jesus how ignorant
Its sad that there are no actual pictures left
But the leftovers are still visible today
You can visit them and the underground tunnels are still active
And as the other guy said, its really cool to chill on the leftovers with your friends during summer
>I guess you could say they were part of the German Reich in WW2, but so was Luxembourg
Psshht dont tell this to a Luxembourger, if you do then they reply that its not true, that they never stopped fighting and that the germans were never able to gain fully control of Luxembourg
Oh and they will also paint your house yellow and come and lynch you at night
(that happened to the german collaborators after ww2)
But yeah I get what you want to say
Its different, in germany you spell the "ch" as "ch" in luxembourgish you spell every ch as "sch".
Ich would be spelled Isch in luxembourgish
But to give an example of what exactly I mean:
Dehnen (to stretch) is nearly the same in luxembourgish
But in luxemburgish you would write "Deenen".
Its pronounced nearly the same way, but we simply banned the "H" in those words because its a german thing
(I took dehnen as an example because its nearly the same)
Good question
But to understand this you have to understand the luxembourgish history and its culture
Luxembourg used to be under french and german influence
The rich in Luxembourg town always spoke french, cause they taught it is a superior language
The normal people on the other hand kept speaking their language - > Luxembourgish
Our constitution is in french
Why they havent changed it yet
Because they argue that it would be too complicated to that
Our language had several reforms since WW2, that doesnt make it easier
Eventough we have our own language, most newspapers are still in german or french
(or a mix)
Back when the EU was created (I mean in the 50s but Idk the english word) the debates in our parliament were still held in french
(The same reason -> superior language)
So our gov tought it would be better when we also speak french on the international stage
Nowadays everything is in luxembourgish, but dont expect our governement to change anything
They push french more than our language because they are profiting from it
Most doctors are french and for a lot of luxembourgers it is really hard to express their health problems in french
(me included btw)
So lots of us want that at least them must speak lux
But nope, no way
In fact, in the opinion of our Governement (its a coalition of 3 parties - socialists, greens and liberals) its kind of racist to demand that they speak or understand our language
We have 50% immigrants here, and Im so glad that a lot of them (and I mean a lot) decide by themselve to learn our language, because our gov wouldnt care
More people than ever before are speaking our language, they are not the problem (eventough the british arent willing to learn the language lol)
And yes I understand why its hard for a french frontier worker to learn our language, but then just support and encourage him and dont say "No its racist".
Yes another guy already pointed this out
Its my fault, but we also learn in our school that we are the only country lol
Bold of you to assume we aren't the only Grand Duchy in the world
I think the reason why we learn it is because Luxembourg was heavily connected to prussia
Our militarys were working together and they financed huge parts of our industry
They were pretty pissed when we said that we wont join the Reich and called us a parasite
They even wanted to annex us, but the UK and France guaranteed our independence
(because we destroyed our fortress few years earlier)
In WW1 they wanted to annex us again, but, as you know, they lost
But our Grand Duchesse drank tea with the Kaiser and that lead to a crisis after the war
She was removed from the throne and died few years after that
(she was very young)
In WW2 Hitler said that we are german, have always been germans and will always be germans
He called it "Heim ins Reich".
He wanted to deport 35k Luxembourgers (15% of our population back then) because they werent german enough
The whole country also striked during that time
Back then People started to say: "Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir si, mir wëlle jo këng Praisen gin".
Which means: "We want to stay what we are, no we dont want to become prussians".
The first part of the sentence is still used today and is our national motto
It even has its own wiki page:
And thats probably why we learned that in school, every Luxembourger is damn ass proud that the germans were never able to annex us
When Juncker called the president of Hungary Orban, a dictator and gave him a light smack on the face
But it sounds more like "th" afaik
My natural inclination is to look for my own countryfolk, but I catch myself and make sure I read everyone else's responses too
Often, yes, about 3 x every hour
Those ads and a few documentaries about fighting poachers make an impression that all there is in Africa is sick kids and dying rhinos
Rare and surprising to see there are cities with people who wear something else than tribal attire
Latvia
Soviet era at school when we were allowed a bit of Latvian history (general one was all about USSR) then we had this "700 years of slavery" story as Germans conquered Latvia in early 13th century
Well, Germans of the time and territory of the time
Germans were the landowners and upper class till WW1 when independent Latvia was born
During all that long time people were mixing and mingling, I don't think you can find many Latvians without at least some German DNA, many have German surnames
There were tensions stemming from class differences that translated as national because the class and nation was the same
Germans claimed they brought us culture
We claimed we were better off before they came and could have achieved better if we weren't their colony
German = rich, desirable with a pinch of jealousy
Then right before WW2 Molotov-Ribentrof pact was signed in 1939 and Soviet army occupied Latvia (and other Baltic countries)  in 1940
They also claimed to bring us culture
1940 is called The Terrible Year, Soviet power killed right and left for the fun of it
Ask any family history, there will be lost most of their members in 1940, during WW2 or after it (after
) Killed, sent to die in Siberia
So when German army came in during WW2 they were regarded as saviours
Fight the devil with Belzebul
Simply liked those who killed less
Germany apologized, Germany paid contributions
Russia said we have to be grateful for what it did and kept Abrene region
When finally in the 1990ies we could actually meet Germans in person we didn't have bad feelings
Came as a surprise when some Germans personally apologised both for the 700 years and WW2
We were working together on international project so was wise to clear any old hurt there might be
I told some of the WW2 stories I had heard from grandparents, they told some from their perspective how Russians behaved in occupied Germany
The old Generation: Yes
My Generation: No, we see the germans as our brothers
But yeah the old people still say a lot of racist things against germans
And the germans are still called prussians
Our national motto is: "Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn, mir wëlle jo keng preisen ginn"
Which means: " We want to stay what we are and definitely not become prussians"
But in recent years we and our politicians have only used the first part of the sentence
*We want to stay what we are*
However, when you tell any Luxembourger that their language is german or that Luxembourgers belong to germans they are getting angry af
Its just a thing that you dont say and if you do its even probable that the other one will punch you in the face
(not me)
But during world cups etc, the most young people here Support germany
We also watch german tv and often prefer germans over the french
(dont know why)
EDIT: Its worth mentioning that our problems with germany began in 1867
The following years they often tried to annex us and called us parasites etc
Well in Dutch save is "sparen", so not too far off
Yes
I only drink tap water
I am always surprised when someone doesn't.
I use about two anglicism per sentence
Granted, I use them mostly in certain contexts
There are some topics you hear about so often in English that you just start using the English vocabulary
However I would know most of these words in Luxembourgish too if I took more time before talking
When I start talking French I get real blockades where I can not think about the French but only the English words
Calling us French, German or Belgian just because we're a small country between those three
Or not recognising us as a country at all (We're not a part of Germany
Joking about the size of our country/population/number of people that actually speak Luxembourgish is fine, just don't do that too much or it becomes annoying
Everyone does that and we've heard all the Jokes, so if you have to, just make you fucking joke and move on
Thank you
Same in Luxembourgish, there is no translation for "Netherlands" other than "Holland"
Oh yeah, Luxembourgish people totally were the baddies for being forcibly recruited or being shot for showing resistance against the nazi occupation…
Well we arent and werent german speaking
Hitler want us to speak german but as a Luxembourger you should know what happened
Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn
We're cool here
And now's the time to learn a bit more about Luxembourg ;)
Yes, but we're taught German and French in primary school as well
I'll never deny that there were people against fascism or nationalism in every country at that time
But there's a difference of a nation clearly being the aggressor and a nation declaring war neutrality at the very beginning and still being invaded a few days afterwards
Elo verstinn ech net, wat deng Fro mat mengem Commentaire iwwert den Zweete Weltkrich ze dinn huet… Bréng bësse Klorheet eran mat dénger Ausso, wannechgeliwwt
Nur ein Joke, Brudi
I need to question your premise
Pretty much all data¹ (wiki link below) I can find shows less than 1 year average life expectancy difference between the most developed EU countries
Usually a few decimals
- I can't find the details but you can bet 1 year is likely within margin of error, i.e. it's not necessarily significant
It's also not enough to question "why" as the variations seem tiny in a rather chaotic space — at least, you want to look at longitudinal studies, taking entire generations into account, because a yearly snapshot is clearly too limited to make demographic conclusions
- Life expectancy should be somewhat differentiated from quality of life, the picture is much more complex
Otherwise good luck explaining that longer life expectancy in China than US correlates with *good living*... (there's really much more to this picture, and it's counter-intuitive in some cases)
But again, within a year of difference, it is almost meaningless to compare because simple genetic or tropic variations could explain such small discrepancies (stochastic)
For an exhaustive answer, and a much deeper insight, I would suggest reading for example the Human Development Report² by the UNDP (UN Development Program)
It's a small book (250ish pages) worth of insights on all these things and much more
Link to pdf below
Look at table 1 on page 300 for instance, it paints a slightly different picture than mere life expectancy
Consider table 3 as well (Inequality-adjusted), see the Inequality in life expectancy (6th column)
It's always a partial picture for such multidimensional matters
Also raw life expectancy at birth is far from telling you the whole piture, *healthy* ("health-adjusted" on the Wiki page) life expectancy is much more significant subjectively (how many years without disease), and the difference relates directly to healthcare costs for that age group
You may also find that inequality in education is maybe worse than inequality in life expectancy, and so suddenly Asian countries like HK or Singapore are much less appealing despite their strong showing in development indexes within the European pack
I would tell you that in general, once you've got the tools for the best life expectancy (healthcare system, medical sector well trained, good population habits, etc), it generally comes down to inequalities within a country — because this impacts the richest decile as much as others
You definitely want to take a look at Richard Wilkinson's TED talk *How economic inequality harms societies*³ in that regard (video link below, maybe watch that first)
Complex topic, but Spain, France, Italy, the UK, Ireland or Germany are very much within the same ballpark, not different enough that you'd want to look solely at biological factors (and the Development Index of Ireland must conversely be contrasted by comments in this topic, it's not all roses either
) Let's just admit that for now, we collectively top these charts on Earth, along with a few Asian democracies (Japan, SK, HK, Singapore, etc
It's a shame that Taiwan is not represented in this study)
Just my 2 cts
Also remember no individual is a statistic
You or I wouldn't personally live 4 months more or less if we moved from France to Spain or back, obviously
List of countries by life expectancy:
(This is where China and US sit at 41 and 42 respectively, for reference)

I haven't seen any film where they would try to speak my native language but I also know Russian
There is a clip running on tv right now, I think it's an ad for some film that will be on soon, I'm to busy rolling on the floor laughing to notice what exactly it is
So there's 3 guys in a car crossing a border and a Russian border guard asks for passports:
\- Ваш паспорт!  (\[vash pasport\] your passport)
\- Ваш паспорт! The bearded passenger repeats just slightly off
Border guard:  Это я сказал (\[eto ja skazal\] I said it)
And the passenger mocks him what is supposed to be: Это я говорю (\[eto ja gavarju\] I say it) but what he says sounds like throat gurgling
Whole dialog is 10 words only
The tv we are on repeats this scene every half an hour and my UK husband says they could never come up with a better comedy judging from my reaction
Hearing Luxembourgish, Portugese, English, German, French, Chinese when taking a walk in Luxembourg City
In a short time period
Supermarket is French, Cafe is Portugese, Bank is English, Administration in French, Newspapers in German/French/Luxembourgish
For people not habituated its pure chaos
First thing i can confirm
Yeah here also
I only have met one woman who had some not too convincing arguments against vaccination but she doesn’t have kids, so her opinion doesn’t change much
Proof that adding a bit of French to your text doesn’t always class it up: [“Petite bites, big compliments”.]

That's fantastic
Grammar for one, couple, many
And what would be the swear word for "park"? Because theoretically the dog may be walked around the block too
If you insert the vowels you get Russian četvert (1/4) and smerč (actually a tornado)
Haha, yes, that's true
Summer or winter time I don't care, doesn't matter how the hour is called
Right now we have the same time zone from Lithuania - Poland border to Spain - Portugal border, 3800 km, no way the same hour looks the same all over this huge area
Main thing for me: please stop the constant moving of the clock
All the reasons why it's justified are just BS
And actually it had to stop already, I think March 2020
Or 2019

Why is it still done
Our prime minister and deputy prime minister are gay
Shouldn't  considered  to be something special but in todays society it still is
According to the conspiracy theory if the "Kalergi-plan" the European Union was created for the "great replacement" another shity right wing conspiracy theory formerly known as the "white genocide" and since the first ideas of Pan-europeanism everyone is in on the plan

Yes
We joke about reconquering the province de luxembourg in belgium
Fun fact, some years ago the province wanted to join us, but we said no
We also joke about reconquering the german and french parts
Well we even joke about reconquering bohemia and brandenburg
There is already a majority of luxembourgers living on the german and belgium border (in one german village a luxembourger is the mayor) but pshht dont tell them
> reconquering a part of another
Me: *Hold my flag
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I felt like nobody would ever ask
Yeah getting parts of Belgium back lol, they even have the balls to call that entire province Luxembourg and keeping the red lion, scandalous
Don't know about other countryman but from my point of view Trier wouldn't survive without Luxembourgish tourists and so many of them work in our country
By now it belongs more to us then to the Germans
And when we are at it, the Belgium named a province after my country
They are begging for it to be conquered
Sabatons songs about the winter war are better tho
Isnt Orban even "joking" about reconquering greater hungary
(Idk if this is the english word, but I mean the borders from 1920)
Hey belgium, we will help you but give us the province de luxembourg back
Sincerly,
A concerned neighbour
I mean, every european nation is joking about reconquering Konstantinople, especially the catholic ones, because of the crusades
A lot of germans in the west also joke about conquering Luxembourg
(reconquer is the wrong word, we were part of the german bund but we were never part of the german reich or BRD)
Source: Im studying in germany
But Luxembourg used to be a private territory of your king and not a part of the netherlands
>Luxembourg should have been brought back under the control of the Netherlands in 2013
Nahh sorry mate, but we can divide belgium if you want to
You guys take the northern part and we take the south
Brussels can stay an own country
Rightful Luxembourgish clay
And we should conquer some land including Bitburg back
Lol
Nah, we're using the money to buy Russia
`;)` Easier than defeating Putin directly
I'd love to hear your method to arrest a country though, I've had enough of France and I think they should be arrested before they hurt themselves too much
(hopefully a giant /s is implicit
Didnt he revealed a monument of greater Hungary a few weeks ago
He also said other things that even outraged the prime minister of croatia
There you go:
Yeah just form a country together
*Sad luxembourgish noises
I mean there is nothing called BeNeLux right
As you maybe know, we are already doing this
There are some german villages with luxembourgish majorities on the border
In one village, a Luxembourg is the mayor
In a few years it will be ours, but psshht dont tell them
All according to medieval plan I see, nice
Really
I dont really understand Orbanas politics in general to be honest
(I dont even talk about the immigration politics)
He is against the influence of Soros but at the same time he welcomes russian and chinese influence
I mean dude, wtf
But to be honest I can understand why some hungarians are still mad at the decisions from 1920, it was simply unfair (in my opinion) that hungary lost 2/3 of its territory
1/3 would have been enough
(I mean it were the habsburgers who wanted the war)
EDIT: But at the same time Im convinced that europeans should stop arguing over god damn borders
Jesus we are all that small, nobody in europe should care about borders anymore
2 days of paid leave when you move to a new home
Not exactly the same thing, but my husband will sometimes say things like “I’ll cut the grass until Thursday”. Like, steady on, I don’t expect you to do it with nail scissors :)
That took a turn
I kind of did already
I lived in Germany for 5 years
I love the people, their food and beer culture and even their annoying administrative ways
Since I do not mind the cold and short dark days, Sweden or Norway might be cool to try and live in
If I wanted a sunnier option, I'd either go to the South of France or Portugal
Those are my picks
There are places where public transport doesn’t really take you places even if it theoretically exists

Kind of cute haha
How did Belgium not have 40° last year and 28-35° this year
Have lived on about 57N latitude, around Xmas and Midsummer we had roughly 4 h of light/dark and 20 h opposite
In winter it feels like there is no day at all: you wake up in dark, go to work in dark, then there is a flick of foggy day in the office window, and then it's dark again, every day feels like overtime because of how long after dark you get off work
Yes, all kinds of light decorations help, Xmas lights, light festivals, alarm with light, whatever
But it's depressing
A bit better when there's actually white (reflective
) snow on the ground, worse in November with all the wet snow/ice rain and wind
On the other hand summers are perfect, lots of light, long days, all green, nice and cosy
But you have to be used to the amount of light too
Foreigners from more southern parts were complaining they can't sleep when the bright sun shines in their bedroom shortly after midnight
Was quite an urgency to find blackout curtains
And water in the sea very rarely is warmer than +17\*C, a bit warmer in lakes and rivers but I would say +20 is the highest you normally find
Fun fact: migratory birds come all the way from Africa or South of Europe because of the long days, then they can feed the chicks almost non-stop
Here in Luxembourg its more like this:
- "Ah yes this guys once said hello and this woman once gave me a pencil, so lets give both of them a vote"
We have up to 23 votes which we can distribute however we want
Luxembourg is small af, so everyone knows everyone
We dont really have a populist party so its fine
EDIT: I mean you can meet the foreign minister in the sauna nearly every weekend lol
I'm young and yet only voted twice
We have eight parties I'd consider important enough to may get involved in the formation of our government so there is already some representation of different ideas
I voted less informed then I wanted, not reading through the manifestos but voted for parties that promote policies I believe in
There is no truly dominant party left in Luxembourg so I felt pretty free to vote for whoever I wanted not needing to consider majorities afterwards
Summing up I wasn't forced to vote for a lesser evil
600k people are living here but only 300k can vote because there are 50% immigrants
During the day there are often nearly 1 million in the country because there are so many frontier workers
‘Oh, isn’t that a city in Belgium/Germany/France/the Netherlands

This is ofteb translated to "castle burning", but in this case "Buerg" doesn't mean "Castle", but comes from the Latin 'burere', "to burn". So a more accurate translation would be "Burn Burning", as "Brennen" is luxembourgish for "burning" or "to burn".
On the first Sunday in Lent (the so called "Buergsonndeg", "Burning Sunday" apparently) the local youth organisations and/or the local fire department build a bonfire with a Cross in it's center
These structures can be huge, as high as 15 meters  and more in some places
Than, after sunset, a torchlight procession will walk to the bonfire and it will be lit by those torchlights
Although I'm sure the KKK would be proud of this tradition, it originates as an old celtic tradition to frighten the winter ghosts and to make sure, that they leave in order for spring to come
At the end of the winter we burn Crosses in all over the country
Like this we want to dislodge the winter
Try Picardy or Brittany
In the future everyone will have to mostly work part time anyways
Otherwise there won’t be enough jobs
I strongly believe in it
I loved my trips to Japan, Israel or the US but coming home, seeing the gentle wheat fields and lush forests with small villages literally every kilometre from the plane over France or Poland and just the feeling of being home, even though I just landed in Paris or Frankfurt, is very strong
There is definetely a european identity
Every european who has already visited a non european country which isnt our neighbour or called USA, knows this
We share so much history, an our history is very connected
We tend to believe that our cultures are so damn different and yes there are some major differences, especially if you compare a northern country like Sweden with a southern country like greece, but at the end of the day they are still pretty similar
You can make rough difference between northern, southern and western, eastern european culture, but then again for non european people those differences are pretty similar
Lets take China for example, a country which is bigger than the european continent and it has a larger population
There are many different cultures in china, maybe as much or even more as in Europe, they also have different languages
Nevertheless nobody would argue that there isnt a chinese identity
Its pretty much the same for europe, well we arent a country, but we are all very homogeneous
True
I feel Luxembourgish but I am also European
I will always be a little happier to meet other European people cause I feel connected to them in some way
Idk why
Oh hi fellow Luxembourger
I think for us Luxembourgish people it's also much easier to feel European because we already have a big diversity in our own country and we're never far from other European nations
I was, why are you asking
I don't think we have one
Hm some say Beligum, Switzerland, also Island or Irland but most do it as gags
Surdus absurdus
And dinja in Russian is a melon
Exotic fruit and food, like melons, coffee, tea, chocolate, even cucumbers came to new areas together with their old names
Some came to different areas from different starting places, like tea in some languages is called chai depending where from it was first imported
I dont like to live here
The country is growing too fast and we have big real estate bubble that will burst in the future
Housing has become so expensive that a normal person wont be able to buy something in the future
Luxembourg has become the country of the rich
Period
And the governement dont care at all
So yeah whatever man
Yes there are many advantages to live here, but I simply dont care anymore
Furthermore I wont be able to get a job because my french is too bad
I will move to germany, thats more than sure
Actually, I already live there because Im studying there
My experience: People in germany are much more friendly (well most of them) and its simply better to live there
I also like belgium, but then I have the problem of my bad french again
Austria is also pretty nice
I still live in Luxembourg, but Im studying in Germany and I also have a small Appartement there
I will leave Luxembourg as soon as Im finished
Housing has become unaffordable and my french is too bad to get a job
Because of some decisions in the last few years french has become more important than ever before (eventhough luxembourgish is the national language and german is an official language aswell)
And as I said my french is simply not good enough and its considered racist/nationalist to say people should speak luxembourgish
(eventough it should be obligated in hospitals etc, but thats just my opinion)
So I decided to try my luck in Germany, Austria, Italy or Belgium
And how do you say "cake" in Swedish
God that sounds like my hell
God that sounds like my hell
An hour
I can visit 4 countries in a single day just by accident: Luxembourg, Belgium, France, Germany
Counted, I've been to 20 European countries, including traditionally religious ones, and no, never seen anything close to that
Walked a pilgrimage and still no
In Luxembourg we have 2 flags, the official one that looks like the dutch one, we almost never use
The second one with a red lion is the one to go with
If there is only one Luxembourger that participates in a sporting event abroad like the tour the france, everybody uses the flag to give him credits and out of proud that finally one guy made it
We still make jokes about it but its too much in the past so nobody cares
But naming the province after our country and also taking exactly the same flag was really a big fuck you to us hahaha
I feel like Germany is the country where the wars that happened, are still the most obvious and unforgettable
Which is kinda
understandable, because your (edit: great-)grandparents started the last war haha
But it is impressive how hard your ancestors did work in the end, to make sure you won't forget about it
Germany is the only country where I feel like WW2 plays sich a HUGE role
Why do people always take everything so literal  isn't it obvious that I am not talking about 12 years old
Like who blames children
My grandparents were children too
One side of my grabdparents are Italians
Does that mean they were Nazis or followers of Mussolini
Which is logical, cause they were children
No idea what their parents did though, I only know that they were starving during WW2
And I'm claiming most of us would do horrible things if someone threatened to kill us or our family
(I hope y'all don't get me wrong, I love Germany
I am not trying to blame anyone here lol)
Yeah never said it's a bad thing haha
I just meant that it is the only country where WW2 still feels kinda present and not like history
No matter which city I visited, there are always many stories about it
Berlin being the most historical of them all
Well I don't feel like "your country" makes it any more inclusive cause it is still your grandparents
Plus it still sounds like the whole country was at fault
And how does it make people feel any better who suffered under Nazi Germany to be included
I am not talking about German Jewish people, or German anti-nazi protestors (Sophie Scholl etc) when I am talking about the people who started the war
I think that's kinda obvious, no
Well all I am saying is, that to me I know that there are German people whose grandparents never were Nazis and I don't want them to feel adressed by this post
Definitely but that's why I'm saying that Germany seems to be the country that was affected the most by past wars until today
:) That's why it is impressive, that their ancestors made sure they won't forget instead of being like other countries who downplay it all
Well you are right there
Especially US Americans get generalized a lot
Yeah I don't agree with some parts but that's fine
Well problem is that is great-grandparents AND grandparents
The other person is right
I am 23 and mine were around 10+ when the war ended
so your grandparents were just incredibly young
But if it eases your mind I'll add "great" in the original comment
3000 ri should be roughly around 1700km (since it is based on the chinese li, I assume that at least the ri mentioned in the anthem should still based on the Chinese instead of the Japanese measurement)
The London Underground might be first, but the Moscow metro kicks its arse aesthetically
Same here, I think "Mail" is even more commonly used than "e-Mail".
I think it would not be  genuine to leave out the HRE
It’s clearly a German proto state on what is today mostly German speaking territory
The idea of a German nation may be new but the cultural connection that all the small kingdoms/ dukedoms shared were still present
It’s true that modern nations like Italy or Czechia were part of it but the core was always mostly German imo
I know he’s a horrible paedo, but leaving his eyes unblurred like that is nightmare fuel
>Like for example, France and Belgium are very close as we share the same language, a patrimony somewhat related, etc
Yo France dont steal our brother
*This was written by the Bel-Lux Brotherhood*
>and Luxembourg is too rich and couldn't be bothered by outside problems
You [sure] I mean nearly 20% poverty rate is not really
Rich
Oh and did mention that [working poor is only in romania a bigger problem
And because Im in the mood, we have the [3rd highest youth unemployment rate, after spain and greece]
Ahh yes god damn this rich Luxembourg
EDIT: Im not mad, its just funny that everybody always thinks that we are rich eventough the reality is much more complex
I just tought our dutch brother would know this :(
I mean, I wouldnt even have a problem with that
A federalist Benelux country in swiss style would be a great idea in my opinion
In such a state we would immediately be one of the most important countries in europe and at the same time the interests of the minorities (like luxembourgers) would still be protected because of the (swiss) federalism
Didnt Luxembourg say we would rejoin when you guys would have a king again
And btw, Luxembourg wasnt part of the netherlands itself, it was owned by your king because he wanted to call himself "grand-duc".
Even if you earn 5k in Luxembourg, you dont live "damn well". In fact you wont even be able to buy a house
Maybe a 30m2 Appartement for 300k on the landside
But only if the bank gives you the credit, because you need to have 30% of those 300k. But guess what its nearly impossible to get these 30% because the rents are also too high
Nowadays 75% of the land is owned by 3% of the people
When you are poor in Luxembourg it means that you wont be able to rent an Appartement
So either you are lucky and get one of those social Appartements or you will end on the streets
If you have a nice family who has enough rooms to take you, good for you, if not
Well leave the country just as the 35k luxembourgers who already did this
(did I mention that only 320k luxembourgers "exist" in total
Being poor is just as bad here as it is in every other european country
Maybe not as bad as in tunisia for example, but why should we compare rich european nations to developing countries
The salaries are high, but they are often not high enough
You will need to earn at least 7k to have a decent life here, but only on the landside then
And honestly its simply not worth it
If you inherit some real estate you have won the jackpot, because then you are a millionaire
But otherwise
You can live on the border, then its totally worth to work in Luxembourg, but a lot of people are doing this and being stuck in a traffic jam for 4 hours a day is simply not worth it in my opinion
I will leave luxembourg because Im too poor to live here
I wont inherit anything and I wont be able to buy anything
I ll move to belgium, germany or northern italy Im not sure yet
But I think its going to be germany
The country has been sold to some rich dudes who buy our Appartements because they know its a good investement
(and then they stay empty because it would be to hard to get rid of the renter)
Its going to be fun as soon as the bubble bursts
EDIT: sorry for the long text, but its just really depressing to talk about this
I know but those statistics are a bit incorrect
50% of the people who work here are cross border workers
(nearly 300k)
The high GDP per capita is partly due to the country's large share of cross-border workers in total employment
While contributing to GDP, these workers are not taken into consideration as part of the resident population which is used to calculate GDP per capita
Thats why our gdp per capita is a lot too high
(its in german sorry)
But yeah our salaries are still high, but as I said they are not high enough
No no hes got a point
Luxembourg is the only country which was part of the HRE and the german bund but never joined the german reich
The prussians were actually pretty pissed, because our militarys used to work togehter and they built our industry
After we said "no" to them, they called us a parasite and wanted to annex us
But GB and France guaranteed our independence
In 1914 they occupied us and wanted to annex us in case they would win
Our grand duchesse drank tea with the kaiser, thats why she was removed from the throne after the war
In WW2 hitler tried it again, he considered us as germans and called it "Heim ins Reich". (Back home into the reich)
He prohibited our language and forced our boys into the wehrmacht
They had to fought on the eastern front and lot of them ran over in order to fight with the soviets
Other fled immediately with their families in order to fight with the british forces
Hitler nearly recuited 5% of our population and the ones who didnt want to serve were shot and their families deported
(their familied were also deported after they ran over to the soviet side)
Hitler also wanted to deport nearly 20% of our population because they werent german enough
After the war, the german collaborators were shot, Gaulleiter Gustav Simon was "stolen" from us imprisonment and then beaten to death by luxembourgish forces in Luxembourg
The other german collaborators had needed to leave their house and were deported into germany
And we had a reform of our language, everything that seemed too german was banned
Actually our national motto is "Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn, mir wëllen jo keng preisen gin"
Which means: We want to stay what we are and dont want to become prussians
Nowadays germany is considered as our closest ally, and germany is loved by most luxembourgers (during the world cups, luxembourgers usually support germany for example)
Replace ours with the red lion
Our flag looks dutch
Thanks to Belgium and the Netherlands for being awesome Partners
Benelux united
Thank you Switzerland for being such a pretty country
Djonn méid his wéi tu e tewwërn sru se dark forrëst, ounli tu faind aut sett hi forgott se manni
Portuguese: Jon maid his uai tu a távern tru de darque forest, ónli to find aute hi forgót his moni
Since I know English, this might be a bit wrong, but eh
Džon meid his vei tu e tavern trū ze dark forest onlī tu faind aut zat hī forgot ze manī.
(Latvian)
Den John mescht sein wee zu enger traverne duerch den Dark Forest, nemme fier rauszefannen dad hien säi Geld vergiess hued
I mean we had the gibraltar of the north but it sadly got dismantled because french people are a bunch of pussys
Don't you like beer
Our natural landscape, our castles, our little villages and our capital city are all beautiful, we make amazing beer and wine, we have a Grand Duke, everyone speaks at least 4 languages, the food is great and public transport is free
Just saying
Hal de Bak du Schäissfranzous
En français svp
Sure but Belgian beer is still more interesting as a whole
See Trappists and lambics for example
J'avoue, je suis français
It's not about giving an European feeling nor is it a tourist trap
It's just people opening restaurant serving food from their origin country
The rest of the world doesn‘t know a lot about us
There‘s people in Germany, which is right next to us, that don‘t know that we have our own language
While most people in the world know at least the stereotypes about Germany, like they wear Lederhosen, drink a lot of beer, especially when it‘s Oktoberfest etc
I think the only thing people really know about us is „Banks“. But f.ex
the fact that we have, just like Germany, our own little annual fair, the Schueberfouer, is something people don‘t know about
Smaller countries are just ignored a lot
When you're abroad or on holiday and you meet someone from your country, this person is instantly your best friend
Also, the probability is very high that you have common friends
**News**
It’s a mixture of national and local news
If you take a look at the Luxembourgish newspaper for example, you get national and international news just like your usual newspaper from a bigger country
Turn a few pages and you get to see short articles about elder ladies donating 700€ for a charity, about a car accident near village X and how the commune of Y got a new firetruck
**Traveling**
Before the Euro became a thing, it was completely normal to have German Mark or French Franc at home, just in case you’d like to go on a shopping trip over the border during the weekend
And before there was the Schengen agreement, make sure you brought along a small present for the border check like a few bottles of beer, so they let you through faster
**Politics**
Changes in politics can happen very fast or very slowly
We had Jean-Claude Juncker as our Prime Minister for over 18 years and his party was at the top for multiple decades in a row
But at some point he made an oopsie, we held a referendum and formed a new parliament, all in the same year
In Luxembourg its totally normal to watch the news and tv channels in general from other countries
(especially germany and france)
We have our own tv channels but still, its a luxembourgish thing
Its also normal to speal up to 4 languages every day
And its normal that we cross the borders at least once a week
Same for our neighbours btw
Hm well first there is the 'mess' or bless with the languages
We can speak so many different languages but the sad thing is also that many foreigners don't learn the local language because 'no one uses it or everyone already know their language so why bother'. Furthermore everything is closer, you don't need to take a 'daytrip' only to get something or to get somewhere
It is really convenient
And lastly well we can always joke about getting some pieces of lands back without everyone going crazy and call you a nazi or some sort, people take the joke as a joke
You don't get the essence of a "true" small country
SEE
How
You are right next to us
1) Makes sense but still
2)I guess I should be happy that we don‘t have some very annoying, incompetent and racist person as president
3) That might have to do something with the fact that there‘s not a lot of Luxembourgish media
I can only name rather ridiculous songs, not anything serious, the only movies that I know of are for children, or„Superjemp“, or Sawah (it plays for the most part in Luxembourg and there is some Luxembourgish in it, it‘s actually on Netflix)
But the thing is, you wouldn‘t watch or listen to it anyways, because Luxembourgish media is normally in Luxembourgish and, while we speak both German and French, the countries around us, don‘t speak our language, so you would have to watch it with subtitles and I feel like no one would do that because the stuff we have actually isn‘t that good, because why would we make movies in a language that no one understands
In Portuguese donkey means "burro". But it also means "stupid", literally
Luxembourgish features the delightful term of the Pimpampel meaning butterfly
I speak four languages and I can confidently say that Pimpampel is simply the best name for those wonderful insects
I don’t really like it (reminds me of pimple), but keisecker and kaweechelchen are awesome words
In Luxembourgish too :)
Never forget the Getëppelt Meppel
You’ve stumped me with that one, I’m afraid (and more importantly, my native Luxembourgish husband too)
A dotted
Fire salamanders are called Getëppelte Meppel
Most of them went abroad but for example science fiction was invented by a Luxembourgish guy who migrated to the states, or first colour photos but that lad went to France
The only dude who stayed in Luxembourg and did something great would maybe be Henri Tudor who created the first commercial lead-acid battery (the first lead-acid battery however was created by a French man tho)
In Luxembourg we call them "Giëlemännecher", yellow men, it's also the name of a bird, the yellowhammer
The name comes from the yellow uniforms the members of the fascist party in Luxembourg wore
Well we are so small that there are almost no to none, the only indie game I know is Sigi - a fart for Melusina and it is not famous too so
Thanks Germany for the cheap groceries
Thanks France for the cheap labours
Thanks Belgium for being our bigger brother
Even though France and Germany played ping pong with us and Belgium tried to eat us whole up when they gained independence, at the end it all helped us out in a way :)
We got a local producer called Rosport also making a soda apple juice called Rosport Pom's
Sumol is portuguese
That explains why we have it too in Luxembourg haha
Hey it is also buy able in Luxembourg haha
Oh I absolutely love Rivella, drank a lot back then in middle school
Really depends on the jokes
I do sometimes joke with my German friends about WW2 but I wouldn't do it if you don't know the rules
like if you haven't been around Germans a lot, it's bettee to not make jokes
Tho jokes about nazis and how stupid they are, are always welcome
I like to play in German
As a kid I always played games like Pokemon in German and to this day I refuse to play Pokemon in any other language because I love the German Pokemon names
Also I prefer German over English so it's not a difficult choice
French tho
dunno
Not a thing in Luxembourg
They would only be possible on the plateaus in the North as the rest of the country gets way less snow and even there they wouldn't hold more then a day max
Not anywhere close to what happened in Beirut, but since you asked: [the Bommeleeër affair ]
It technically happened in Belgium but it was right on the border - the [Martelange disaster] A truck carrying 47,000L of fuel missed a turn, crashed into a bridge and exploded, killing 22, injuring 47 and starting dozens of fires
My Italian colleague told me she was there when the Bologna bombing happened, sounded terrifying (obviously enough)
I just looked it up and it was the 40th anniversary the other day
Honestly, I had never heard of it before she told me
Crazy to see they’re still investigating it
I love Bologna, by the way
Seems like it would be a great place to live
LOVE IT
Growing up, my family of 5 drank at least 3 liters a day
that’s because they milk the bulls too
That's it
The place where a huge meteorite fell over 100 years ago
It is right in the middle of nowhere and only known for the meteorite
Having a weird-ass language
(Well, dialect if you wanna be more precise
) The Dutch get all the credit, though
Luxembourgish is one of the wierdest languages I know
It has grammatical rules, but I, for one, cannot comprehend them and the pronounciation varies from French-sounding to almost Dutch
P.S for the OP:
Que região é que come caracóis
Nunca ouvi falar disso
Oof
I completely forgot about Welsh, sorry about that
No Norte, acho que não é. Pelo menos, eu nunca comi nem vi nos restaurantes
Pois
No Norte é mais frango e leitão.
We got older cities with a certain architecture to them
In most city centers construction rules forbid to erect skyscrapers
I know London has that wierd law where you can't block the view on Saint Paul Cathedral
European urbanism is different and skyscrapers are no part of it
Well here in  Luxemburg we call ball pens "Bic"
Razors are most offtenly reffered to as "Gilette"
And we call most offroad vehicles Jeep
Yes, kite and dragon mean “Draach“ in luxemburgish
The literal translation of kite from French into English would be *flying deer* but as far as I remember the etymology is the same (dragon) but the spelling somehow changed and turned it into a deer instead
Edit: it's the same word for both in Luxembourgish
This, but with fellow countrymen
Maybe she was asking you where the restroom was
All the time
Look at the dimensions of Luxembourg
There also are no border checks at all inside the EU
There are people coming to Luxembourg everyday from the surrounding countries to work here and vice versa
Also, small correction, it's not exclusive to the EU, or true fir every member, it's sbout the so called Schengen Agreement
Schengen btw is a town in Luxembourg on the German French tri-border area
Personally, before CoViD 19 began, I went home every second weekend, crossing two borders to do so
Within EU you don't have to be a citizen of that country where you live or work
You can be citizen of A, live in B, cross over for work to C, go shopping to D, on holiday to E and so on
And to tease Americans it's all covered by free healthcare
Before lockdowns were a thing weekly grocery shopping trip either to Germany or France
Belgium is less interesting but they got the closest Ikea
Now we are a bit confused as we can't get to the usual shops, at least not that easy
Or just for a dog walk
Depends on the mood
A little further but still easy reachable are the Netherlands and Switzerland, maybe not a day trip but ok for a weekend
Only need ID the same as locally, you have to have some ID always
And for dogs EU dog passport with marks of vaccinations
Mind that most countries are small and some are very tiny, you make 1 wrong turn on the autobahn and you are out of your country
Edit: and about 200 000 people come in for work daily
In a country with 600 000 residents
And Grand Region around Luxembourg with parts of neighbouring countries
And now there are no phone roaming fees in EU, you pay for the calls from/to another country the same as normally at home
But school trips need lots of planning, you can't just take a bunch of underage kids and drop them off in the middle of an empty field for a few weeks
It has to be interesting, dynamic, educational, within reasonable price, safe, comfortable enough
Schools know their trip locations and rarely change them
On mobile phone
Because for me it's literally the same as after the roaming fees were cancelled there is no aditional cost for any calls be it from home country to abroad, abroad - home, abroad - abroad different combinations of countries, all are covered by subscription, I don't have to watch how long I talk to my family and from where
The same as mobile internet
Maybe because that list is for business
Or maybe you have to rise a big stink about it
My plan for when I retire
Saving for a motorhome now and then go, stop whenever there's something interesting, explore, go again
Some country borders have been pulled this way and that way like a too narrow blanket, people living in border areas just wake up in a different country one morning
It reflects on the language
I mean if they can't even stop on pedestrian walks, they will certainly drive around the Arc de Triomphe at high speed
I haven't been in Paris but I've had several experiences with French drivers
French if we exclude all the French people who come here for work but don't live here or it would be Luxembourgish
It will be totally legalized soon here
So yeah seems like even the governement is a fan of it
But yes most young people are smoking it
But oh boi it will be fun for our neighbours as soon as we legalize it
Yes
Im high
Level is very good, very rarely do I see any mistakes
I am currently abroad to go to university, but I'll probably go back home after I graduated, unless there's a good job offering I could get
There wasn't a real university in Luxembourg until the early 2000s, so it is still the norm for students to go abroad, mostly in Germany, Belgium and France, but there are a lot of students from Luxembourg all around Europe
Yes
Moved from Portugal to Luxembourg when I was 11 (I’m 24 now)
And couldn’t be more grateful
Thanks to that move,
I now speak 6 languages, I’m doing a masters degree and live in a great tiny country and can see quite a good future for myself
I sometimes wonder what my life would have been if I had stayed in my little rural village somewhere in the Portuguese mountains
It's "iron lane" not iron road in Luxembourgish(Eisenbunn), but that's but a small technicality
In German(Eisenbahn), it's also iron lane, in French(chemin de fer), it's iron path
Yep, nonsense text and some random year number
Lately I've even seen geographical coordinates
I looked one up and it was some point in the North Sea east of Scotland
Maybe an offshore oil drilling platform
Or just completely random
The only Lithuanian I know is like a big, goofy puppy who loves basketball
I would have guessed more like Estonians or Finns
Although I know a Latvian girl also who is the most cheerful person on the planet, so maybe it’s all dumb stereotypes
Belgians are the dumbest people alive
I'm really interested in European politics but happen to know most about German politics followed by British
I lack a real understanding of French politics and have little idea what happens in Spain except fir separatist movements
Once something gets internationally relevant like Poland's and Hungary's efforts to abolish democracy I will have heard of it
What I lack in knowledge in national politics I make up for with my understanding of the politics of the European Union mostly
It's fascinating
Seeing how long a country can go without government is so interesting
Those wierd seperatist movements are similarly interesting
They spent nearly two years to form a government coalition
They had no formal government
People working in the ministries will still do there jobs and live continues but no one is in governing the country
When I was a librarian, my watch always went wrong from using the magnet machines
Also, the library was in an old psychiatric asylum, so I suppose that was spooky too
Peasant and herbal medicine healer as in the family
Without the modern medicine and cosmetics I would be a horrible looking witch with crooked and missing teeth, wart on the face, gray hair, limping badly and have a hunch
That is if I somehow managed to survive all the incidents and illnesses our medicine of today so far has pulled me out of
Infusions can only do so much
Probably death or a maid/slave of the Preussen man (before Germany got founded) Luxembourg got taken by the Preussen so yeahhh not very cool
What kind of logic is that
The communists won the civil war and have control over the main land
They are the legitimate government of mainland China
Edit: I'm obviously not in favor of the CCP and would personally like to see a regime change
We're in the same boat
International companies can never decide if we're a German or French speaking country (I don't even expect for them to support Luxembourgish)
Some titles on Netflix are not available in their original English but only in German or French
A lot of websites automatically only allow a german or french
The Amazon website doesn't differentiate between interface and content language
I want it to be in English but then it also often automatically translates french and german product descriptions to English what I don't want
If I change the settings to German, it translates english descriptions to German what I also don't want
I was surprised when I travelled to Spain and no one wanted to share
In my opinion France should lead the way in the EU
France  has always preserved the european culture and wasnt afraid to say no to the US
... But then again there is germany who keeps sucking the balls of the US, Russia and turkey
They also have the strongest military in europe in general
They are highly trained, they have their own military industry and they have one of the highest Budgets here
Some say that turkey have a stronger army, but their equipment isnt as modern as the french one and their soldiers arent as trained
They only problem France has is that their economy has stagnated the last 2 decades
They need reforms but yeah nobody has the political power to do it
Is the book "For Whom the Bell Tolls"?
So I don't know much about African or South American history, but I'm not ashamed of that
I feel like I should probably know more than I do about the American War of Independence
EDIT: This is /AskEurope
Anything East of Poland, south of Russia and pre WW1 is basically a big ? for me, unless you go back into antiquity
The Müllertal, Luxembourg's little Switzerland
Our Country is ideal for tourists in most places but the Müllertal is a little above the competition
To clarify, I understand touristy as ideal for sightseeing in this context
If you want to know some tourist traps, I know none
Most would know that a state or a bigger city is in America but also would not know which city is in which state, except the most famous ones, and some even don't know which is a state and which is a city
"That name sounds American".
Yes
Open borders, single currency, no customs inside, different countries, different climate, rich history
Happy 25 years
It's compulsory in Luxembourg
I am quite surprised that it is that rare
Those numbers mean that even Luxembourgish is more frequently spoken
It mainly surprises me because Ireland still is much larger then Luxembourg
Considering both, its size and its population
I can understand the different circumstances but still would have guessed wildly different numbers
This is beautiful
In Luxembourg it is the norm to drink tap water but we have quite old piping do we drink bottled water
Wroclaw is the first I haven't heard of
I've heard of most of them however with a poignant lack of Polish and Romanian cities or Eastern Europe more broadly, however reading the comments here I know some by older names (Szczecin and Brno)
The only city I hadn't heard of outside of Eastern Europe was Murcia in Spain
Just know atleast a bit of German and French then you're good
Learn french and german first
Super helpful advice, thank you

The border between Luxembourg and Germany is mostly* defined as the Moselle, Sauer (or Sûre if you will) and Our rivers
The fun part: it's not a line through the rivers or along the rivers, but the rivers themselves
So the whole shape, that's created by the river is a condominium (under the sovereignty of both countries)
*mostly, because there's one small part near the City of Vianden where the border circles around the castle instead of following the river in order for the castle to be part of Luxembourg

What do you call the supermarket (or is that just in Norway)
Clearly I need to visit Sweden to expand my knowledge of regional supermarkets
Darn, no reason to visit Sweden now
We do have some here and there but most are just ruins and barely any left
One of the reconstructed and really beautiful view on the landscape is [the roman funeral at Bech Kleinmacher] Further north there is a [villa] near the oldest Town of the country but onky ruins are left
Then there was also [a small city]  (arguably the most important and impressive remains in the city)
Not too much is still known, everything is in ruin and there are still remainings not yet found
The best preserved is a [mosaic] found in Vichten (where a replica is there nowadays)
One can see it while visiting the National Museum of History and Art in Luxembourg City
There one can also see some smaller stuff found in Luxembourg (coins for example)

We have a lot of people working here that don't speak Luxembourgish, so most people just start a conversation in French and the other reply in French just to find out after some time that both actually speak Luxembourgish

I can't answer you first question about university prices in Luxembourg cause I'm studying in Belgium, but rent is quite high here
There's probably student housings for much cheaper though, if you're applying early enough to get one
What I can say though, is that their aim for the University of Luxembourg is for it to become an international university as opposed to one attracting Luxembourgers, so studying in English shouldn't be a problem
Alcohol, cigarettes, gas, coffee
but thats it
Fuel, because fuel taxes are low in Luxembourg
Alcohol, Tobacco, gasoline, taxes
Luxembourg:
Diesel for under an Euro the liter,
The 95 Gazoline is 1,01 € the liter
It’s awesome awesome and the price will fall even more
Heavy alcohol and cigarettes
In Luxembourg, it's an official holiday
Other EU members are supposed to follow
Not really, at least far less than the national flag on Grand-Duke's day, but at least it's been a national holiday over here for a few years now
When they introduced it here, the government said that apparently every member state is supposed to have that holiday in the future but for now it seems as we're the only ones who have it

In that case, thanks for educating my to know better
Yes, but regarding the context of the discussion here, the entry difficulties are a valid point to be brought up
To work somewhere, you ideally have a residence there first, making the living cost a real entry blockade
Finding a suitable workplace isn't always evident even ignoring that
Higher living costs will also always be a burden on poor people and never is all poverty self-inflicted

The language is a sensitive topic here
There are actually luxembourgers who will get very angry when you tell them that luxembourgish is similar to german
Its because of our history with germany/prussia
Since the creation of the german reich they tried to annex us and called us parasites
Then in WW2 Hitler tried to convince us that we are germans, luxembourgish was forbidden and we had to speak german
Everywhere were posters which said: "Luxembourger you are german and your language is german"
Well this backfired of course, so Hitler decided that he has to deport everyone who isnt german enough
(the plan was to deport 40% of our population, at the end only 7% were deported because of the ongoing war)
The deported ones were replaced with germans from the balkans and Alsace
Luxembourgish became the most important part of our identity back then
Furthermore Luxembourgers were forced to fight with the germans on the east front, a lot of them tried to change sites there, but sadly the soviets often shot them before they reached them
At the same time Luxembourgers were used as cannon fodder because the germans looked down on us
(eventough they said we were germans)
Those boys were told every day that they are germans and that they have to fight for the führer eventough they hated the nazis as much as the soviets
So yeah after the war there was a widespread racism towards germans and collaborators were often lynched at night
There was also a reform to ban everything from our orthography that looked too german
And people started to use french words for words that sounded too german
Our national motto is: We want to stay what we are
It used to be: We want to stay what we are and we dont become prussians/germans
(because we still call germans prussians but nowadays without hard feelings)
So yeah its still a sensitive topic nowadays, some people still get very angry when you tell them luxembourgish is similar to german
(especially the older generation)
I don't understand Dutch, Flemish, Frisian and Afrikaans at all
Maybe a word here and there but mostly not
Low German is somewhat understandable but still have to put my whole concentration on it
Fun fact: when I was in the Netherlands and talked with my friends in Luxembourgish people thought we were natives and talked with us in Dutch which was weird and confusing
But they didn't understand us
Luxembourgers have to actually learn German, it doesn't come automatically although it's easier than some other languages
Luxembourgish is much softer sounding than German
For foreigners who are learning Luxembourgish knowing German or Dutch does help a little but they are different enough that you need to learn, can't just sail through
Mir kënnen et jo mol austesten, villäicht verstees de mech am Enn awer nach
Wee weess alles ass méiglech haha
Well its worth mentioning that most germans actually never learn luxembourgish because they have a lot of problems in pronouncing our language
They usually start speaking a whole new language which is weird mix of luxembourgish and german
I mean you can understand them and they understand luxembourgish but it just sounds weird
Eventough I speak both languages I cant speak their version of luxembourgish/german
Nope it wouldnt
People really just got a problem when people say its like german or its just a german accent
And this is because of our history
And I also wanted to state that nowadays our hard feelings towards germans are gone
We even have a huge cemetery for their fallen soldiers in WW2
The cemetery is even bigger than the american one
(and the american one has the grave of General Patton)
But yeah its mainly because the nazis wanted to destroy our identity, and the language was something like our last resort to clearly show the world that we are not germans
It is quite similar to german but following a conversation will take a lot of practice if you only know standard german
Maybe as intelligible to germans as swiss german
Lots of french words in there too which makes it a bit tricky
Gramatically it is also very similar to german (it loses the genitiv declination like many dialects do too)
I'm not from there but I do have lots of friends from there
The language there is German but in the southern part (St Vith) they have a dialect that's pretty close to Luxembourgish so you could have a conversation between a Luxembourger speaking Luxembourgish and a Belgian speaking that dialect with both understanding each other
People from around Eupen (northern part of the region) usually don't understand Luxembourgish though
Ops, ops, ops, there is no German speaking part of Belgium
The Wallonian part of Belgium speaks French and the Flemish part - Dutch
Luxembourgish is spoken in Luxembourg only
Even if the part of Belgium nearest to Luxembourg really is called Luxembourg too they still speak French there
Yes almost, I said:
We can test it, maybe at the end you do understand me
Who knows everything is possible haha
Wasn't that hard I guess :D
Edit: forgot the haha at the end
Its has its origines from a dialect
But I know some people who are not able to speak german, like my father for example
And most luxembourgers have a weird accent when they speak german
(like Junckers accent)
.. But yeah the language is a very sensitive topic here and nobody will ever call it a dialect and when you they will probably get very angry and call you a nazi
Im made another comment on the reason why, here is the text:
>The language is a sensitive topic here
>There are actually luxembourgers who will get very angry when you tell them that luxembourgish is similar to german
>Its because of our history with germany/prussia

Gustav Simon the former Gaulleiter was kidnapped from american detention and then beaten to death here in Luxembourg, because people from the resistance and the governement didnt want to see him in front of a trial
>There was also a reform to ban everything from our orthography that looked too german

>Our national motto is: We want to stay what we are

>So yeah its still a sensitive topic nowadays, some people still get very angry when you tell them luxembourgish is similar to german or even a dialect
(especially the older generation)
I know you are german, so no worries nowadays the hard feelings are gone, we even have a bigger cemetery for the german soldiers here than for the american soldiers
If you want to know more about this topic you can watch the "Heim ins Reich" documentary on youtube
Yeah that really helps and it sounds similar too
Enn is Ende for example
I understood what you meant and its possible to talk about this with some people nowadays but always choose your words wisely
My opinion is that Luxembourgish nowaydays is a proper language
It has its own grammar and orthographie which is in fact very different to the german one
But this doesnt mean that its very close to german
Its still a relatively new language and at the start of the last century it was 100% a dialect
But even today its very close to moselfränkisch
Oh I didn't know that haha, in Luxembourgish it is an
Quite like it actually
Never heard of anyone here who hates our capital
The biggest complaints are always about the insane amount of construction sites and they are right >.>
Yeah we like it
Mmmh im from the east and people from L City are often portrayed as snobbish pricks and feel themselves better by using excessive french slang in their language
I agree its worse in DE for example
I think Luxembourg is somewhat unique in that aspect
We have 3 official languages: Luxembourgish, French and German
People who have gone through the Luxembourgish education system will know and will be able to speak these 3 languages
Apart from these 3 languages we also learn English at school
You get taught German in 1st grade, you start with French in 2nd grade and English in 8th grade
Luxembourgish is usually on the school schedule from 1st grade just until 7-8th grade
In primary school you usually just read stories in Luxembourgish and in 7th grade I was thought some grammar as well, but not too much
Note that even though we aren't taught Luxembourgish as thouroughly as German, French and English, it's the language in which I and most people in Luxembourg talk to each other in the everyday life
School subjects are often taught verbally in Luxembourgish, but are written and read either in French or German
Example: In biology class, my teacher taught and explained everything in Luxembourgish but the sheets she handed out and her PowerPoint were in French and we also had to write tests in French
Apart from all this, you need to know that 47% (2019) of the population are immigrants
The big majority of these 47% are EU-citizens and a lot of them are from Portugal or are of Portuguese descent
I have to mention, that there are "immigrants" who have been living in Luxembourg for decades, may even feel Luxembourgish but just don't have the Luxembourgish citizenship because they don't need to, because we live in the Schengen area
Young people like me, who have been born in Luxembourg to immigrant parents will know 5 languages and this is pretty normal here
A lot of people I know speak 5 languages
My parents though, they know their mother tongue and they know French, no Luxembourgish
This is the case for a lot of immigrants
Since everyone speaks French, by only knowing French you will have no issue at all living and working in Luxembourg for a long time but it will be more difficult for you to integrate into the "native" Luxembourgish society
So yeah, to respond to your last question specifically
You're definitely at a loss if you don't speak Luxembourgish and French well and it's uncommon for the young generation to know less than 4 languages (Luxembourgish, French, German, English)
If you don't know these 4, there will be situations where you won't be able to communicate with the person in front of you
It's expected to be fluent in French, German and often English too
Luxembourgish is considered to be an advantage
Most job offers expect at least 3 of these languages as not optional
Yeah some Luxembourgish people dislike speaking French for whatever reason
There are tours all around the historical heritage of our capital and I prefer thosr to any museum in particular
Most of our Museums are quite standart
Two that stood out to me however were the City museum and the National military history museum in Diekirch
The second one is basically only about the battle of the bulge though
I love it when people try to speak any of my native languages
Maybe the people in Luxembourg were just annoyed because you wanted to talk to them in French haha
Money, iron ore or the smell of fertiliser
With the number of construction sites we currently got here concrete could work as well
Other alternatives include: diesel and tabacco
I'd call coffee the better choice because a pizza smell is a nearly impossible thing unless you define what pizza we are talking about making it to specific
Those are rookie numbers
But is there a Margeritha smell that isn't just Oregano and Basilic
In Luxembourg it will still be about half of a normal man's salary that goes straight into living
Yo what half of the salary
Where the f.. do you live
About 60-70% for normal people is far more correct, maybe not for the fonctionnaires and bank employees but for the rest its more than 50% unless you live somewhere in the north where nobody really wants to live
I'm sorry for me naiv questions
I grew up on pizzas made from Bosnians and Portugueses
Nah, as long as I don't visit Italy I can live with the sin I commit by eating Portuguese pizza
Hm only 5
Well Amsterdam, Colmar, Prague, Athen and Saint Petersburg
In my mind the 0 signals it's a date written
Like you can write 01
21 or 01/02/21 or 01
02 or 01/02 and it's clearly a date but if you just write 1
2 or 1/2 you can mix it with anything
Might be a matter of taste, but I say yes
Ive never had a luxembourgish gf
My first gf was french
The cultural differences werent that big
My ex gf was from croatia and my current gf is from serbia
There aren some differences, but it are minor differences
But Ive learned one thing:
**Never** talk about the 90s. **Simply dont**.
In my family we have half a dozen to a dozen different nationalities, depending how you count
14 languages (some speak 4 or 5 but they also overlap)
Lingua franca is English
Living in 4 countries
And some more where some of us has lived a longer while
I like to have either a place to stay or insiders knowledge about the cities I go to visit
Maybe we have already rubbed of the edges but cultural differences don’t seem too big
The same you could find within one nation just family traditions and personal preferences
2 stories:
Once my ex gf asked me why my grandpa and my whole family was able to forgive the germans
Context: The nazis killed all of my family, only my grandpa survived as a kid and thats also the reason why I dont know where my family actually comes from and what my real family name is
(we dont look like luxembourgers, we have the latino look)
And I replied, that after the war people wanted to move on and that we (Luxembourgers) tried to forgive them
It were the nazis who killed my family not the germans in general
And then she replied that she cant understand this and that she wont ever forget serbians
Then I replied that this is stupid, that hate only leads to hate and that nearly 30 years after the war its time to move on
Oh well she didnt share my opinion
Then my current gf and her family are from kosovo during the war they were forced to leave their house so they fled to serbia
In serbia a bomb from the NATO hit their house where they stayed, afer this they fled to Luxembourg where they became refugees
(and stayed)
Once we were talking about serbia and the eu and I said why isnt serbia just accepting the independence of kosovo, because of the law of nations
(right of self-determination)
After a long discussion she even started to cry and I realised that this topic is simply too complex to be understand by a western european
But I honestly think that I helped both of them because Im strictly against nationalism
Nowadays my gf sees a lot of things with other eyes which is good
a for and, e for anyway
It's a personal thing
My father for example never wants to talk about it while others openly discuss it
Idk dude
The semi presidential modell was established by Duverger to describe the political system of france
However your system is a bit more complicated because as soon you have the cohabitation situation, your president is weak af
(Cohabitation - > the Opposition party has the power in the parliament)
The official languages are Luxembourgish, French and German
Additionally, almost everyone speaks English, except for older generations
>What languages are the schools or the government in
In school, German, French and English are taught in undergrad
Discussions in the parliament are in Luxembourgish, legislation is generally in French, but all government documents are available in Lux, Fr, Ger, Engl and also Portoguese
>How early do they have you start learning the other language(s)
If I remember correctly, we have started to learn German at 6, then French at 7 and English at 12/13
Also, non-language classes such as history, geography, math, etc
were taught in German until highschool and after that in French
Luxembourg here: mostly everyone born and raised in Luxembourg knows at least 3 languages and are more or less fluent with it (luxembourgish, french, german) and most people even know 4 or even 5 languages (second generation kids from immigrants) or highly educated people
Sure there are also immigrants here who only either knows 1 or 2 languages (for example french people only knowing french which is enough since most people know french too)
Luxembourgish as 52% of the population are Luxembourgers
Although in the private sector the most common languages are French and to a lesser extent English
You might hea people mostly talking in French or Englishbwith each other at work, because they're a lot a commuters (over 200k per day) coming to Luxembourg, so Luxembourgers talk to them in the language they are able to speak
>Sounds like a cool place to live for language freaks like me
Definitely
However life can be a bit boring compared to big European cities
Yes its a German dialect (Moselle Franconian)
You would surely understand it
I studied in Vienna and most peoole could understand almost everything
I think most people including myself consider it as a separate language, as it has been enriched by many French words (differentiatly pronounced)
However, the historical roots of Luxembourgish is a German dialect
>Isn't this a controversial matter in Luxembourg
I think the large majority does not care at all
This is why Luxembourgish is not recognized as an offical language in the EU, as the costs of translating every EU documents would be way too high for our small population, that can read them in either German, French or English
Is using Roman numerals for the century number in common writing a Polish thing
I'm not sure if I'm being trolled, but no, I (native British English speaker) was taught to write "thirteenth century" or, more casually "13th century"
Every day's a school day
Well Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg and Luxembourg, from Luxembourg
I'm not sure if the capital Luxembourg city was ever on the second spot
If it ever happened it was somewhere between 1850 and 1975 during the height of the ARBED (later Arcelor) and then Esch-sur-Alzette would have been larger
Esch certainly was more important during that time even getting an airport of its own for a little while
Liège is larger then Brussels
Didn't expect that
No not really, honestly
Depends on how stereotypical the person looks
I just guess if someone has very distinct blonde hair and white skin, he came from north
In general yes but the north is fairly big
Many very different countries
That would be like those fun map divisions Beer Europe/Wine Europe etc, the same Blond Europe/ Brunette Europe
Unless I hear them talk I can't tell
And even then it's not accurate
Most can't tell apart Finnish - Estonian, Latvian - Lithuanian, most Slavic languages
German is spoken over several countries and if you don't know the differences, it's all the same
Fashion choices only work if they are tourists, if they are foreigners living in the country after a few years they dress as locals
yes we have most of those in luxembourgish
except "armes würstchen", we would use  "aarmen däiwel". we also don't use the leberwurst one, I only recently learned about leberwurst/leberkäs, we don't eat that here
Of course we eat Leberwurst and Leberkäs / pâté in Luxembourg
Thing is just that nowadays most people do not eat it anymore
French people often think that Luxembourgers speak only German and german people often think that we speak only French (though not that many) and no one ever thinks that we speak Luxembourgish too
Watching people realize that we speak four languages pretty fluently is so funny
I don‘t know what they think we speak but German people realising that I know more about the grammar of their language than they do is just hilarious
Really
You didn't know this as a Belgian
Aren't all languages made up
The problem is that Luxembourgers immediately switch to another language if they detect that you're not fluent in one
If your German has an accent we switch to French or English and the other way around
French people in shops or restaurants of course don't do that and their English is mostly non-existant
Probably Spanish or Portugueuse (largest minority in Luxembourg comes from Portugal)
People working in restaurants and shops are mostly from nearby France or Belgium so they will expect you to speak French
Our press is mostly in German, sometimes in Luxembourgish or French
Schools start with German and later French
The government speaks in Luxembourgish but laws and official statements are mostly written in French
I don't get that reference
Mostly trilingual or quadrilingual (English gets taught in high school), though some have more of a working knowledge of either French or German depending on their background
Luxembourgers are often better in German, families of portugueuse or italian origin better in French
Most Luxembourgers do
A lot have an immigration background (Portugal, Italy) so they speak another language with their parents than they do with their friends of their own generation or in school
Well this even applies to Luxembourg, there are many different dialects here
Miseler, Minetter, Stater, Éisleker and more, which is crazy if you think about how small the country is
Newest historic research thinks that they were invented in Paris
But I have to admit, the best french fries are always from Belgium
Except the fact is people say ‘Brussels’ regarding European-level decisions because they don’t actually know who they mean
The European Council
The European Parliament
The European Commission
People have very strong opinions about the way the EU runs - but they often don’t actually know anything about it
And most of what they do know is lies told by people like Boorish Johnson
We are the only with Luxembourgish for sure
When you want a more exciting answer, depending on the section you took you get two different math courses
Don't know if that's common or not but I doubt it
Also some courses might never come up in outher countries till university or are subjects like technical drawing taught in college in other countries too
Edit: Other nicher classes include Educi Education of citizenship and it's counterpart Civic which is basically the same
And accounting is a college class as well
We have it as a subpart of later art classes
Danish is okay, I understand the context . Flemish, English, german and Low german is easy
Luxemburgish is home game, since I’m luxemburgish
Yes
Home clothes are nice but not for office
And I have dog walking clothes that can get muddy or torn on branches and I'll not be sorry
According to the Internet it is "um Neiluerenzscheierhaff" (21 letters), single one would be Schlënnermanescht (17 letters)
Honestly Idk, I dont want to sound ignorant but as soon as I cross tje border to germany or belgium it just feels already a lot less rich, some people here even say that the 3rd world starts across the border
(I mean a bus driver earns about 80k at the end of their career here, some engineers with a masters degree dont earn that much in germany)
I have never been to monaco but most other countries where I have been had lot less good infrastructures and were generally more poor
However countries like Sweden, norwegen and Denmark had some places which seemed pretty rich
EDIT: and everybody who says we dont pay taxes, inform yourself lol
Every normal citizen has to pay an income tax which is nearly as high as the one in germany, except for lower salaries, which is fair
Big companies used to get low taxes, which was a Crime and supported by a small elite
Its the main reason why the Juncker governement lost its majority, it nearly destroyed our country
Deauville in Normandy is most definitely the wealthiest place I've ever been to
The entire town consists of expensive estates and as expensive cars parking right in front of them
Even though less then four thousand people live there they got a massive yacht port, a prestigious casino and a horse racing track
A ton of Luxembourgish people buy appartements in and around Knokke and the Belgian coast in general but especially Knokke because its prestigious for whatever reason
While some parts are quite nice calling Knokke overrated is probably warranted
I always thought that it was cool seeing Estonian cars in town because that’s pretty exotic (even if they are in the Schengen area)
It wasn’t until way later that I realised, that the 'E' on the liscence plates in front of the Spanish embassy is in fact for Spain and not Estonia lmao
I also know Russians tell their e-mail address like "name doggy server dot country"
Belgium and Netherlands
As a luxembourger, i never get to cheer on my nation on any tournament so i tend to cheer on germany
In nearly every team sport there is a qualifying phase to qualify for the main tournament
We cant qualify for any tournament because we re too bad to get through qualifying
We played portugal in the qualifying phase of the 2020 european championship
At the soccer match against portugal there were i think more portuguese fans than luxembourgish fans
honest answer: people call us a microstate all the time and it really hurts our feelings :(
>Luxembourg
>Not sure if it's a microstate, to be honest
I rarely think about it
I've been told it's the place to buy Bitcoin from
Officially its not, because we are much bigger than the microstates and we will hit 1million people in the next 20-30 years
We also have a large diaspora on the borders
Luxembourgers are the largest minorities there
For example, in some german and belgian cities, the mayors are luxembourgers
Its all according to our old plan, a growing population and a diaspora to reclaim our land
(especially luxembourg belgium)
Ive never heard that you can buy bitcoin here

Is that in  reference to the wars
Because I think it's our strong point haha
I feel like someone should challenge you to come up with an F1 fact for every country
On that note, I grew up around the corner from Bruce McLaren Drive
And had no idea who that was

Luxembourg is not a microstate though
Sure it's small, but compared to microstates, it's huge
that's what my girlfriend keeps telling me
how about centistate and we call it even
we hear it a lot and it hurts our feelings
True, but that also meant that there was no prolonged fighting in our country, so I guess that's a silver lining
this is cute, i like it
a wee state
at least you have coastline
The way it feels from my perspective is that microstate = unimportant
The prefix micro is used as a diminutive both literally and figuratively
Not that there's logically anything wrong with being a microstate, but i believe that deep down everyone wants to feel important
"i have a wee fetish" said the Brit
"oh, what is it

The US is a warmonger and it is time for Europe to get it’s shit together and create their own defense pact without the US
Further destabilisation of the region will undoubtedly create a new refugee crisis and this is the last thing the EU needs right now
We should act in our own interest not that of the US
Can I get all my news from you
Belgium, probably
It's the only country that we'd allow to invade us
O corpo é que paga, by António Variações
One of the best songs I've ever listened to
Unfortunately, many people around the world won't experience it, since it's in Portuguese
You got Luxembourg who loves those songs though ;) Ok granted
we speak the language
A shit the Holz one really boomed in German speaking countries, even 7 year olds always said “Ich und mein Holz” constantly
Being smol and often mistaken as a french or german city
The first with an openly gay prime and highest percentage of workers coming from outside of Luxembourg
Also highest trust in media outlets
Number of official languages ( french, luxemburgish, german ) . 47% of foreigners
Last grandduchy in the world
The front door next to the driver is for entrance only so I say hello when I enter the bus
Exits are in the middle and at the other end which would make it awkward to shout thanks though the entire bus
Can tell it's not native accent but usually can't tell where from
Dutch is a Germanic language, their accents are not that different, for all I know it could just as well be one of the native ones I haven't heard yet
Russian and other Slavic on the other hand are very easy to spot
Written: no
Hearing: yes always
It is easy to point out someone isn't native English speaking
Omg hahaha
“I need you to write that report until Monday” (instead of by Monday) is also a giveaway for Germans
Dutch accents sound the best if we're talking about broken English
Like the Dutch accent in English sounds so cool
I don't think I've ever heard a Flemish person speaking English
Plus I can barely hear a difference between Dutch and Flemish, I am sorry haha
This woman has the cliché Luxembourgish accent
If you ask me, it just sounds like a farmer
No other explanation, we just sound like farmers with a mix of German haha
The best solution would be create a Benelux country with a swiss style federation
(im switzerland every kanton has its own constitution, and every kanton also has its own parliament) like this we would be one of the strongest nations in europe and at the same time it would solve your problen because the interests of minorities would still be protected and the federal governement wouldnt be that important
>You guys all understand Dutch and also act like you do
That's just a lot easier
Well Luxembourgers dont understand dutch but we do understand french
(have to learn it in school)
>Question: why would we Dutch want that
>I mean, you Luxembourg are rich and that's nice, Flanders is good too, but
>Couldn't we donate Wallonië to France
I mean as I said, in a swiss modell the kantons are relatively independent, so there wouldnt be much of a problem
And the dutch would would profit aswell, because their country would become a lot more important from one day to another and at the same time they would stay relatively independent and they could protect their culture
I mean the dutch are always joking about reannexing Luxembourg and Belgium
Oh god please why you had to remind me of our disgrace of a ghetto song
I’m just waiting for that Luxembourgish comment which either says “The North” or “The South” of the country, I’m still waiting
Scrolled down to look for this comment
Also waiting for someone to ask "Wait, Luxembourg has a North or a South
Ha, we often even have three names for villages (official french and/or german and then the luxembourgish one)
Like Ulflingen in German, Troisvierges in French and Ëlwen in Luxembourgish; it's the same town
Town signs feature at least two names
Any kind of rap
Like seriously [here] is an example
If you listen to the lyrics closely, you'll hear nonsense
He doesn't even know what he's talking about
This was life-changing
These would be a great basis for a Sitcom called “Welcome to the Bundes-Irrsinn” which would be similar to “The Office” but with actually no work at all compared to it
It‘s a boring piece of shit
Royal gala, big red, pink lady, granny smith, and at least some 2-3 less known varieties that I have forgotten the names
And 2-3 different pears
Use this to cut the eggs for salad: slice once, turn the egg, slice again perpendicularly, get more or less cubes, mix with whatever else goes in the salad
To actually get heroine you need to add acetic acid anhydride ( simply vinegar wont work lol ) to acetylate the 2 oh groups of morphine ( = diacetylmorphine )
Also you need to transform it into a hcl salt to have a stable compound
So heroin is semisynthetic and while its precursor morphine is found in poppies itself isnt
I think its very hard to actually get a proper yield with very crude methods that these junkies used
But you actually have lots of opiate alcaloids like morphine or its precursor drug codeine ( methylmorphine ) or papverine in opium poppies so to get high no neeed to do that
But heroin is more potent than morphine and due to these acetly groups is a lot more lipophilic and gives a way better rush ( especially iv )
Heroin itself a bit like codeine gets metabolized to morphine in the body ( heroin > monoactylmorphine > morphine ) so it really is the same but gets much more efficient absorbed by tissues
Stay away from opiates
I used tramadol recreationally a few times and while its very nice ( floaty, nodding off) it burns itself into your memory
I found other drugs like dxm or lsd much, much more euphoric than tramadol but its a nice clearheaded, completely worryfree mental high while your body feels very heavy, painfree and warm
You are way more sober in your head than eg benzos or alk or even weed but i you have problems it solves than better than most other drugs, and thats exactly why you shouldnt think about trying it if you have a smwth addictive personality
I know tramadol has serotonin action, and to a junkie it would be to weak and stimmy, but without opiate tolerance it was pure heaven
Its the devil
Its qualitative worryfree euphoria that makes it so tempting, but it not even comes close ( even if i was nodding the fuck off and breathing slowly ) to mdma, weed/dxm, lsd
in terms of quantitative euphoria
Also dont make tea out of poppies you have grown
You can easily kill yourself if you have no tolerance, no way to get a right dosage
Only way would be to extract opium latex and to smoke it
Not that i had ever done it, no thanks
Andy Schleck losing the chain of his bike which prevented him from winning the tour de france for Luxembourg
Dude thanks, now I don't need to come up with a response for Luxembourg
Under the condition that united Benelux doesnt end up like Belgium today because of cultural differences
Luxembourg has a national maximum price on petroleum products (Gasoline, Diesel, Heating Oil etc
) These prices are updated every day
This is also the reason, why so many people cross the border to fill up their car, turn around and drive back home
I'd like to borrow recognition from Germany
Hunnegdrepp meaning honey liquor
I think that gives the taste away
English as language is pretty basic
The only really confusing thing is the spelling: I can’t write a word if it’s spelled letter by letter
At some point I get tangled, give up, and ask to name the letters the German or Spanish way
I lot of towns here get separate Luxembourgish, German and French names
I can't name them all but here are some examples:
Lëtzebuerg (lu) - Luxemburg (de) - Luxembourg (fr)
Ëlwen (lu) - Ulflingen (de) - Troisvierges (fr)
Heischent - Heiderscheid (de + fr)
Iechternach - Echternach (de + fr)
Veianen/Veinen - Vianden (de + fr)
Niederkäerjeng - Niederkerschen - Bascharage
Péiteng - Petingen - Pétange
Kéideng - Ködingen - Koedange
Cliärref/Klierf - Clerf - Clervaux
Wëntger - Wintger - Wincrange
Helzen - Helzingen - Hachiville
As said, this is only an excerpt
Nearly every village in this country will have a slightly different name
There are also some Luxembourgish names for places outside the country
We call:
Paris - Paräis
Aachen - Oochen
Liège - Léck
Brussels - Bréissel
Bastogne - Baaschtnech
The list goes on
The only one we have, Luxembourg
We call it 'Lëtzebuerg' though
Geoportail
lu, it's fantastic
And on mobiliteit
lu there is a map too, mobiliteit
lu and it corresponding app are a service of our public transport but it includes ways by car, e-car, bike, on foot, etc shown on a highly detailed map of our country
It is probably the same map as offered by goeportail but I'm not sure
1€: no idea
maybe instant noodles
Nothing else
Maybe one vegetable
10€: depends on where you shop
can't even get a pizza for 10 bucks in most restaurants so this is hard to answer for me
100€: also depends
Can be one pair of jeans, a shopping cart for 1-3 people (again depends on where you shop) or
idk hha I can't make things up
I can only dream of this haha
AHAHA the 10€ is hilarious
But honeatly, stroopwafels are amazing, I miss them
One of my favorite things to eat
And fuck you because im very hungry now:/
I love octopus w a little oil and garlic
edit : weirdly enough i hate shrimps
Once they are on your plate you eat them, not discuss philosophical problems
Doesn't it rain a lot in Galicia
I would like to go there for a while, a little longer than just tourist visit, may be a few months up to half a year, but no more
Would go to the most interesting places that I have read or seen films about
My Great American Tour
I'm clearly not willing to live there or give up my very cosy European social security
>Portland Oregon
you call it a small city and it has more inhabitants than my whole country
I'd say "Ierzebulli" and "Gromperekichelcher" would qualify
Ierzebulli is somewhere between soup and mashed peas with sausage thrown in and Gromperekichelcher are fried potatoe discs
The German have the later one as well and depending on region call them "Kartoffelpuffer" or "Reibekuchen"
We mostly make French Carbonara with the boyscouts
We once had a Finnish partner group on a camp and they doubled the culinary heresy but not buying any cream because we still had milk there
Can't recommend
Probably just means names for countries that have a different etymological root than the English name
I'd say it's "Renert  _oder de Fuuss am Frack a Maansgréisst_" (which translates to "Renert _or the fox in white tie and man's hight_")
Although I have to admit that I never read it
It's a Luxembourgish adaptation of "Reinecke Fuchs" by the German author Goethe, but with a lot more of political satire mixed in
Or Hildebrandslied
But that happens in the final version as well
He summons an Earth Ghost in the first act (Nacht) and the ghost tells him that he's pathetic and vanishes again
With A2 it's impossible imo
There is so much difficult vocabulary and depth in there, that reading Faust only becomes feasible and enjoyable at B2 or C1 Level
Hell I've studied German nearly all my life now and this is just not A2 material - as far from it as possible
Haha no worries, I'm reading it right now so it's fresh in my memory (and I'm loving it so far
Don't worry, it's a bit unfair as Faust is mandatory for the Abiturklausur (sorry I don't know the English word for that one) in Luxembourg if you take german in your final year, what most people do
So every student from Luxembourg knows some verses by heart and knows the details of the story and it's many many interpretations
It has been like that for almost half a century and it shall always remain like that
(At least no one intended to change that part of the exam so far)
> Still, a very good book
I have to agree with that one, it's far better than Homo Faber, the other 'all time classic' we had to study that year
Yea I really don't like that he is remembered so much for Homo Faber
Fortunately we read _Andorra_ and _Don Juan oder Die Liebe zur Geometrie_ the year before and those were quite good
Do you mean in History, Literature or culture
Because in that case both
Being cramped between 2 grand powers of Europe, you kinda have to look both ways to get along with everyone, which is important if you want to survive between Napoleon and Bismarck
But the upside is, that you can take the best of both worlds an therefore improve your way of life an your culture in general ;)
Well it's complicated
Luxembourgish, German and French are official languages and are therefore used often, but the law itself is written in French so although you can communicate with authorities in any of those languages (and english as well) and they have to awnser you in the same language, the default language if you're contacted by them (parking ticket, Covid-test invitation, etc) is french
&#x200B;
I'd say most people watch TV and read the news predominantly in German and Luxembourgish, but many watch French TV as well
Although it mostly depends on your personnal preferances and what you grew up with
English media is gaining in popularity and many younger Luxembourgers like to watch Netflix in English as well
And of course you shouldn't forget the sizable minorities; almost half of Luxembourgs Residens are immigrants nontheless, who often will consume their media in portuguese, italian, spanish, dutch, croatian, montenegran, polish, ... (you get the idea)
And all of those people have an impact on our culture as well
So in short: it's a big mix of all with a Luxembourgish core
>Does it affect the "national identity" of Luxemburg
It didn't change the national identity but rather became it
Old truely Luxembourgish traditions are still around and won't go away anytime soon
The influence of all the migrants added to this feeling to the point that you could argue Luxembourg became the melting pot that the US always wanted to be
Openmindedness, hospitality and multiculturalism became a big part of our identity and we're proud of it
This has also been happening for a very long time, [a documentary] had noted that already back in the 50s!
&#x200B;
>especially after the world wars i guess
10 points for you
Although the law had been mostly in French since Napoleon reformed everything back in the day, the German sections were all translated in the late 40s.
Well in private, Luxembourgish is used more than German, but the media is consumed more in German than Luxembourgish, so there's that
I detest everything about it
I'm not a football fan so that makes it even more clean cut to me
The FIFA is and has always been one of the most corrupt institutions on the globe
Handing a World Cup to Qatar only proves this to me
However decide to play football in the desert in air-conditioned stadiums should be brought before trial and held accountable for such idiocy seen our climate crisis
Qatar has no history with the sport at all, making it not even comparable to the World Cup in South Africa, a country where football at least is a popular sport
The fact that the stadium in the desert are also build under working conditions comparable to labour camps is merely the final nail in the coffin for a World Cup I believe should just be boycotted
I have heard the term Hellegt Réimescht Räich being used in Luxembourgish, just the _vun Däitscher Natioun_ isn't used very often
So just like in English, it's called Holy Roman Empire, ditching the _Germanic_ part
Short answer: Yes
Long answer: it depends on the teacher
Officially in German until 4e/10th Grade (so age 15-16) an after that in French
But many teachers talk to the kids informally in Luxembourgish, using the appropriate official language only in written form
No, this wasn't stupid at all :D
Most of them do
English is an exception _obviously_, and I believe Economics is only taught in French as you only have that from 11th Grade on if at all
On the other hand, those who have history of arts and music have it only in German
And Math is a bit different, the switch there happens 3 years earlier in 7th Grade
Auto mobile = self walk/move
Politically correct English language
Americans expect the whole world to know what fucked up shit they did to each other 70 or 100 or 200 years ago and avoid the words they used then
Sometimes I feel like they shit in the English dictionary and then tell us not to use it because it stinks
And racism everywhere
For Europe they are all Americans
Agreed
16 in some European countries
Soon there will be no acceptable way to describe anybody who is not paper white
Haha
Luxembourg : rich
Snobby
Finance center
Renting prices through roof
Multicultural ( more foreigners than natives )
Lot of history
By far most important city
International
Picturesque espec old town
Esch : criminal . Drugs
( not srious)
Echternach : Oldest city
East near german border
Has a very nice church — Basilica
Grevenmacher/Wormeldange/Remich : Wine' ( riesling, elbling )
Sunny
Miseler Land
Wiltz : In the north ( éislek - ösling )
Farmers with weird accent, cold
I live in neither of these
What about Malatya
was there in high school:) beautiful city
Luxembourg has 12 places that have the title of a "Stad", meaning "town". Out of these 12 towns, Luxembourg City is the only one to call itself a city since it has over 100k inhabitants
Hey they were busy
I still don't know why but Luxembourg is filled with different dialects
They vary, some may only effect how a specific syllable is pronounced while others have a unique vocabulary
Nearly every major town in the North will have some sort of dialect
It's ridiculous considering the size of the country
So Luxembourgish has its origines in german
As you maybe know german has a lot of dialects
Luxembourgish used to be a german dialect too, but nowadays its an own language - a pretty young one
But yes we do have dialects
Some villages still have their own dialects, but the most important dialects are from the moselle area, from the minette (the south) and from the oesling, which is the north of the country
There used to be more dialects which you could hardly understand, but most of them dont exist anymore
Luxembourg is quite the important financial center
Esch/Alzette used to be very important for our industry but the glory days of our mining industry are long over and this country isn't really vital for Arcelor Mittal anymore
Currently we got the Hub Bettembourg, a new logistics center, the Cargo Center in Luxembourg and then there is the plan to attract the upcoming space mining industry whuch will probably be centered in Luxembourg city as well
It all started with our steel industry and once that started to decline our government started to diversify its efforts to attract a variety of businesses
That's why we tried to become attractive for financiers and the logistic sector and now try to be there at the birth of the space sector
I guess we also have a small IT business running here but that's mainly because IT companies are profiting from our tax system
Luxembourg = Finance
Literally every building is a bank
English: Thanks
Luxembourgish: merci
French: merci
German: danke
Spanish: Gracias
Italian: grazie
Portuguese: obrigado
Russian: spasibo
Dutch: dank
Swedish: Tack
Most of the steel used in the One World Trade Center came from Luxembourg
Echternach
Went there to high school, oldest city in Luxembourg ( funded by Wilibrord in 697 ), was one of the most powerfull monasteries in the early middle age
Very nice stituated near the german border, has also the largest roman villa northern of the alps
5000 people live there
small but fine
If I remember right, there is a community in Romania which speaks nearly the same Language as we in Luxemburg
Don't ask me why, but yeah its true
EDIT: ah there you go:
Half-French half-German here
I was born in Germany but raised in Luxembourg ( I spent only one year in Germany), so I am really divided here
If I can I will identify as both but since I recently also got the luxembourgish nationality I now tend to just say European
However if I have to pick one I tend to say Germany
Interestingly all my siblings who have French as mother tongue identify as French
I rarely manage tl finish all of my dish, especially pasta
So I always take it home with me
The more fancier the restaurant the smaller the portion and you need a looking glass to find it
Big plate, a symbolic piece of food in the middle, some sauce "artistically" smeared on the empty parts of the plate
Feels more like a sample than the real thing
Even those places where the portion size is good, still it's reasonable for an adult to finish it all or so much of it that taking it anywhere doesn't make sense
But yes, restaurants do have boxes for leftovers and there's no problem getting them
I believe the concept of Moscow as the “third Rome” is based on religion, rather than on ties to the ancient empire
From an Orthodox perspective, Byzantium becomes the “second Rome” after the Great Schism (if not after the fall of Rome, I’m not sure), and then Moscow inherits the title after the fall of Byzantium
Moscow thus positions itself as the capital of the third great Christian empire, inheritor and defender of the purest form of the Christian faith
Luxembourg's Kniddelen are delicious
They are flour dumplings (the kind without filling) served with bacon and sometimes they get backed with a little cream and a tiny bit of cheese
I just realised that there's an incredible lack of French replies here so I wanted to answer in there behalf being very familiar with the French culinary scene
It's a crime that Tarte flambée hasn't become as wide spread as pizza
While tarte flambée isn't really obscure (at least I hope so) it should have spread across the globe cause its amazing
For those who don't know tarte flambée is made from a thin dough covered in creme, sliced onion, bacon and sometimes other ingredients such as a variety of cheeses or mushrooms
In contrast to pizza, you can even turn it into a good dessert by making on with caramelised apples
Luxembourg got the exact same thing
We call it Ierzebulli (pea mud)
Kniddelen are definitely underrated as a national dish, even within Luxembourg
I wouldn't be surprised if they are the most eaten traditional food together with Gromperekichelcher
Biterballen are way better though
However they share some similarities to the fricadel, one being that I totally don't want to know all the ingredients
I'd argue that both of those dishes are also by far our best dishes
Being honest, food prices are also different in Germany
I study in Aachen and whenever I go back home I'm shocked at the difference
In Luxembourg Flammkuchen and Pizza have similar prizes with the former being somewhat cheaper and both always cost more then 10€.
Well I think Iertsebulli is also up there, they're far better than traditional _Judd mat Gaardebounen_
I don't know about Rhône but it made its way to Luxembourg
Pain surprise is often served on official government run occasions here
You could always upset everyone by just keeping the name of your country in your language
Serafima
Would even like it for myself but it is very foreign and only met very old women who had the name
I know
The one I was together in language classes should be well over 100 by now
Probably dead
Wasn't even a nice babushka
Still the name has the taste I like
Oh, no, please
My mom read a book nobody else knew about and liked one personage there and now I have an ugly name and nobody even remembers the book
No, I didn't read it, tried but it was way too boring even with the added curiosity about my name
If you need a Latvian name ask here, the system is too chaotic to explain, but I can tell if the one's you picked from a phone book or wherever do sound ok
Being between Germany and France was probably the most fucked up location a tiny country could have
Kind of explains our national logo "we want to stay who we are". Today we love our neighboors though
I feel that
Please not, you guys already took half of our country
Revenge is sweet haha
Not for Christmas but for Sylvester/New Year's Eve everyone's watching [Dinner For One]
Letzeboia
Not really a thing, but we had the [Peasant's War] over 200 years ago
In our language it's still called War of the bats because the peasants revoluted against french taxes with bats and scythes as they didn't have any guns
In Luxembourg, the first 6 years of primary school are entirely taught in German
The following 7 years of highschool are then taught in French
However kids with an immigration background, which are very common,  have difficulties with the german in primary school
Oh boy, here in Luxemboug we are obligated to learn 4 different languages
The first language I learned was luxembourgish, in the first grade we started to learn german (nowadays its french as far as I know), in second grad we started to learn french and in 8th grade we started to learn english
I some classes you also have to learn an additional language like spain, italian or portuguese
(I visited a class with a lot of maths, languages werent our priority)
Our school books are either in french or german
(math books mostly in french for example)
But the courses are usually held in luxembourgish (while using french or german books)
Well the first 6 years aren't entirely in German
You start to learn French in 2nd or 3rd grade
Only non-language classes (like math, physics, history) are in German for 6 years (aka
primary school) and one by one switch to French in secondary school
And don't forget that you learn English too, starting in 8th or 9th grade
Of course they dont teach French in German
Yes, but as you described it, you could think that you learn French only in secondary school, and don't learn any English, which is not the case
And the prevalence of French in secondary depends on if you're doing classique or technique
Technique remains mainly German
I live in a town so there isn't a huge identity linked to it even if there are noticeable differences in between Luxembourg's towns
There are dialects to be found in single towns
I feel most at home within my region and that even past Luxembourg's border as the Ardennes are mainly Belgian and extended a little into Germany on top of covering Luxembourg's North
Due to the Luxembourgish language I do also somewhat adhere to our national identity
Worcestershire sauce
Mainly because more than half the letters aren't pronounced and the other half make sounds that are foreign to my native language
_Kaweechelchen_
Yea, checks out
Thanks to the Québec Canada is incredibly close to France, Belgium and also Luxembourg
Luxembourg has some nice natural reserves
I suggest looking up the "Naturpark Our", "Naturpark Obersauer" and the "Mellerdall". Posting a single picture wouldn't properly represent those regions and posting a dozen galleries isn't tgat productive either
The Mellerdall should be the most unique and beautiful place
It's also called Luxembourg's little Switzerland
There are several lakes in Latvia with similar floating islands
Ops
Sorry
On November 6th, 2002, [Luxair Flight 9642] from Berlin to Luxembourg crashed 2 miles short of the runway
It was caused by an error of the pilot, due to thick fog
It is our only commercial plane crash since WW2, and claimed 20 lives, including [Michel Majerus] a decently famous Luxembourgish artist
Every frenchman: "You don't pay taxes" and "So how is it to be rich
"Where are you from
"I'm from Luxembourg
:)"
"OMG it's so rare to find a Luxembourger
What is it like being rich
"Yeah well,... not everyone is rich here you know
"But Luxembourg is like a little Switzerland right
"Not really
"Okay, but can speak Luxembourgish
Is it even a thing
Isn't like a German dialect
*"No
Very symbolically in Luxembourg
But February is usually quite cold, there may be some snow still this winter
We have had snow in April
I'd you're counting Luxembourg
Advantages are ambitious programs like free public transport and legalisation of recreational weed
Certain goods are very cheap (alcohol, cigarettes, petrol)
One big disadvantage I see and I think this might be a bit unique to Luxembourg, is the apparent parallel societies of Luexmbourgers and foreigners/their descendants
I guess anywhere people foreigners and natives will keep to themselves but it feels much more pronounced because of the small size of Luxembourg and disproportionate amount of foreigners
Oh, and it can get real fucking boring here
Some Luxembourgers resent the fact that Luxembourgish is slowly losing in numbers and therefore don't like speaking French/German/English
Which I do understand, death of ones own language is always sad
Not that it excuses them being rude to you
I do doubt that it was because you're a minority though, I myself am one and have never felt like people have treated me differently because of it
That's Liechtenstein
Finnish - so melodic
Scottish English - sexy
Spanish
Greek and French are absolutely beautiful
I hear French quite enough in my daily life but I rarely hear Greek being spoken in public which I wish would happen more
Silbo
And the spoken version - Guanche
We celebrate it with "three kings cake" (roughly translated) a pie made from puff pastry with frangipane filling, sometimes with apples to present an alternative
Inside the cake/pie there's a little figurine
Whoever finds it gets to wear the cheap cardboard crown you get with the cake/pie
That's all we really do to celebrate the 6th of January
Sorry I got no recipe
Never baked one
I checked and you will find at when searching French Galette des rois
If it qualifies, there is the famous (in Luxembourg) "Mir wölle bleiwe wat mir sinn" or in English "we want to remain who/what we are". It comes from a well known song text by Michel Lenz and is our country's motto
If a part of a song text doesn't qualify it's probably "Hier steh ich nun ich armer Tor und bin so klug als wie zuvor" from Goethe's Faust because half of all people in the country where forced to memorise quotes from that book in school
I would love to read smth from Pessoa, but can't speak Portuguese unfortunately
Did he also write novels (that you would recommend)
I'd feel less bad to read a translated novel than translated poetry
Our gov didnt want IKEA in our country (dont remember why)
.. So they built it literally 100metres away from our border on the belgium side
Nevertheless, IKEA is pretty popular here, but its also seen as a low budget furniture store with furniture that you only can build once
France also has good cider but they treat it completely different handling it like wine while on the British Isles it's handled more like beer
I generally prefer the English kind but French red cider is delicious and every local cider in Normandy is just excellent easily beating most brewed in England
Not making fries like a Belgian is just doing it wrong
I can accept steakhouse fries in some cases like served with fish and chips but in general Belgian fries are great while other countries fry cardboard
Belgium has some great cheese coming from its abbeys as well
Goes well with the beer
Belgium cheese is quite soft while remaining a rigid cheese, so nothing like brie
Even though Luxembourg is tiny there is a massive discrepancy between the North and the South
In the North you will still find snow in April in some places
In the South you will see the last of it mid march if it even stays so long and or snows at all
The North of Luxembourg is part of the Ardennes and so subject to quite some snowfall
The couple last years have been lacking snow in general though
They are accepted but at the same time you don't see them on people with high paying jobs
Latvia: three main confessions (Catholic, Lutheran, Russian Orthodox) and a bunch of smaller ones all claim they have 50-90% of population as followers but in reality very few people are actually religious
Up to the point where one clergy person circles through all the churches on a schedule instead of having one per church
So most likely atheist or indifferent is the default
Spanish, Italian and some slavonic language
I already speak English, German and French, so Spanish and Italian seem like logical next choices, maybe Chinese would be smarter then Italian though and then any slavonic language, because once I know one, I heard it's quite easy to pick up more
Same in Luxembourg
On sunday we often go to my gradmas house
Then my father, his brothers and me usually start to talk about something
It usually gets louder and louder and at some point its like shouting
Its always fun
Not much
Those who already have a job, usually get the minimum wage which is about 1900 or 2300 when you are qualified
Most of them either still live at home or in very small appartements because housing is too expensive and you cant afford anything with those salaries
(especially not around the capital)
However when you work for the state, then you will usually earn much more
When you have a master you will get around 5500 the first year
After 3 years its already at 7000
It will go up until 16000 at the end of your career
With a bachelor it is a bit less an with a highschool diploma also less
But in order to work for the state you have to pass several exams
Thats why everything here is fucked up
You wont earn anything in the private sector and at the same time you will earn a bunch of money in the public sector
>Banking there pays well tough, no
Depends
50% of the banks left since 2008 so its hard to get a good job
Our salaries dropped because of the frontier workers, they are ready to do the job for 2k because after taxes its still 1800 (you dont pay much taxes when you dont earn a lot)
But its devastating for the people who live here
We also have 50% immigrants here which were also ready to do those jobs for much less money
However today they suffer the most under this situation, because Luxembourgers can work for the state and get a nice salary, but nom-Luxembourgers are not allowed
A bus driver who is a state employee earns about 6k before taxes, in the private sectore they only earn about 2,5k thats insane
The North would be more populated, have less thick accents and be more diverse in terms of nationaliyy/country of origin
If infrastructure and housing switched places too, it would be way more developed-ish and less rural
Luxembourg would have the highest density of population in the whole world in the North and the lowest in the South
It would be a huge problem as the North has not enough place to have so many people and in the South each person would own a street of houses
It's not
I think it is illegal in all of Europe and should get you a fine
This doesn't mean that public urination doesn't happen in larger cities though
Especially cities filled with tourists
Amsterdam handles the problem really well with their public FREE urinals
On another note discreetly pissing into the woods or bushes at the side of the road outside a city is ok
You my friend obviously haven't heard angry francophone people honk at you yet
Just honk at least once a day
Passive aggressively
I thinks its our usage of 3 languages ( luxemburgish, german, french ) in daily life, written and spoken
It can be very confusing
You got the right way of doing things, I like it
Well here no one expect you to buy your own house or apartment nowadays anymore (at least those I know including my friends and so)  ( today it got announced that [prices increased by a lot even during the pandemic ] More and more people get higher education compared to the past so the least go to work with 16 now
Since nobody lives there can we have it back
Pretty neat
I can get to Germany, France and Belgium within 30 minutes haha
I live in Luxembourg not unusual to pass by our three neighboring countries in a single day
Hello neighbour
Do you live in Trier
Just the most obvious one
I think they save paper and put pages in languages according to where they send the stuff to
It's super annoying here as all instructions and medicine leaflets don't have the English version
I bought one 10 years ago, it's still in the kitchen
Although my husband likes all modern stuff and we have another one with bells and whistles
And why not peel them over the right bin
Thanks, I'll try it
If I do potatoes I sit in front of the bin, elbows on knees, peels fall in the bin
Easy
Drive
Try walking in high heels on cobblestones
If you can then try it after a drink
De Feierwon is a clear pick here seen how it was a contender to be our national anthem
Luckily it isn't because it directly brings up Prussia and would thus have aged quite poorly
Reasons for luxembourgish:
Only about 300-400k are speaking luxembourgish which means it would be a fair choice because 99% would have to learn it
If it's interesting bet I've been there at least once
Within about 50-100 km
Also within 5 km walked all the shortcuts between houses, unnoticeable paths to the forest/in the forest, even local Ikea shortcuts
Medicine, IT, Economics, Law degrees are paid well
School teacher is also an option ( yeah thyre paid highest in the world )
50% is employed by the state so you have a stable job and get paid very well ( but never well enough to buy a house
Its terrible )
From personal experience i know way too many people who study psychology, we dont even need that many
Im biology student ( bsc ) in Germany , but plan to work in Luxembourg ( first in research, then idk ) in ecology/ conservation or neuroscience
In Luxembourg it is inevitable to not know french atleast and english ( latter mainly in it )
Laws are written in french so there is no way around it
Luxembourgish and German are also nice to know, but especially the latter is not that important
Biology it depends things like biotech or genetics are growing very fast and paid well, classic disciplines like zoology, ecology (:/) or botany dont have that many jobs or job growth
But i expect conservation biology to become much more important due to climate crisis, extinction and pollution — we depend on it
The easiest way for me would to be teacher in a high school, but i dont think i would have the nerves to do that :p.
Best to do is studying medicine, we have way to few doctors and source large amounts of medical professions from France or Belgium
But i was never interested in it, especially interactions with patients was a no go for me
Just move to luxembourg, do a master in a subject you are interested in, apply for a job in the public sector (well you have to become Luxembourger first) an earn 6100 pre tax in your first year
However, If you apply for a job in the private sector your salary will be around 3k even for engineers
So yeah in Luxembourg a philosopher in the public sector earns more than an engineer in the private sector
(not native luxembourger here, but lived long enough)
from what i've experienced, a conbination of german and english is already pretty good, and you'll get away with not knowing any luxembourgish
the real mvp is french, though, as it's the most commonly known and used language in day to day situations
if you've gone through the luxembourgish school system, you'll be fluent in at least french, german, and luxembourgish
Da du sowieso Deutsch redest kann ich auch auf Deutsch antworten
Mit Deutsch alleine kommst du hier nicht mehr so weit, vieleicht im Osten (aber obs du dort eine Arbeit finden würdest welche deinem Diplom entspricht bezweifele ich) oder in einzelnen Unternehmen, aber sonst ist Französisch und Englisch schon ein Muss
Englisch allerdings auch nur in der Finanzbranche und einzelnen Unternehmen
(auch IT)
Französisch ist aber natürlich ein Muss
Sogar unsere Gesetzgebung ist auf Französisch
Luxemburgisch solltest du als Deutscher auch recht schnell lernen
Die Sprache wurde zwar nach dem 2Wk "entgermanisiert" und trotzdem ist sie immer noch eine germanische Sprache
Im Gegensatz zu den Franzose verstehen auch die meisten Deutschen nach ein paar Jahren lux
Aber naja ich sags mal so, wenn du einen Job in Deutschland oder Österreich findest, wo du auch noch eine gute Rentenvorsorge findest, dann würde ich auf jedenfall als Ausländer in diesen Ländern bleiben
Der Immobilienmarkt ist unmöglich, man zahlt für ein 30m2 Studio auf dem Land 200k €.
Gleichzeitig gibt es im Privatbereich Lohndumping, da die vielen Grenzgänger und teilweise auch Immigranten (wobei dies eher früher der Fall war - Luxemburg hat 50% Ausländeranteil) die Löhne halt extrem drücken
Klar im Finanzsektor und in verschiedenen IT Firmen kann man auch viel verdienen, aber solch gute Jobs findet man auch bei euch
Über 50% der Luxemburger arbeiten für den Staat
Dort gab es kein Lohndumping und ähnliches
Ein Busfahrer der für den Staat bzw Gemeinde fährt, verdient fast 6000Brutto (wegen Schichten usw) im Privatsektor sind es oft nicht mal 3000 (der Mindestlohn beträgt knapp 2000)
Aber ja wie gesagt, wenn du aber etwas studiert hast wo du keine Ahnung hast was du arbeiten sollst, dann lohnt sich der Luxemburger Staat definitiv
6000 Anfangsgehalt und mit Promotionsexamen kann das bis auf 11k raufgehen (dann zahlt man allerdings 50% Steuern) und das ist auch hier verdammt viel
my parents both work in the financial sector, don't speak a word of french, and get along just fine, so i guess it also depends on the industry
and actually originally from your big neighbor country, poland
Rip Luxembourg
Takes more than four beers and 11:45 pm but definitely a dürüm
Being in the middle of nowhere is often called "in the middle of the Pampa" or also "um Hond hannen": at the dog's behind

That could just mean that the law works as intended don't you agree
I see, so you don't think the law is working as intended
Or just unnecessary
You finish high school at either 19 or 20
The year you start school isn't based on the calendar year you're born in but rather on the academic year
Edit: there's 6 years of elementary school and 7 of high school
Ettelbréck's name originates from the town's history
Apparently the Huns under Attila crossed the Alzette there
Ettel comes from Attila while Bréck is Luxembourgish for bridge thus coming together as Attila's bridge
Edit:
I also know the origin of Luxembourg so I might as well share it here
It's was named after a castle that was build there
Lucilinburhuc was the name given to it meaning little castle and from there the name Luxembourg evolved
Interesting
Luxembourg city has a district called Hamm
That one probably has the same origin then
University of Luxembourg
Why
Because it's the only one
That does sound fun
All-around great comment, 10/10
I mean, "pecuniary turpitude" – Google results show that you're the first person to write those words since 1885
Anything over 50kph is high-speed to Americans
Yep
Horses running and huts burning
I had the same problem coming up with a Luxembourgish one
For Luxembourg I guess that the French beignets count because we somewhat share culinary culture with France
Maybe that there is a similar situation for Switzerland of foreign dumplings crossing the border
As I don’t live in the country that issued my passport it’s always a pain in the ass to renew that or ID card
Involves lots of traveling either to my country or to the nearest embassy which is not near at all, need a few days off work to get there on a working day working time
So from practical point I would love to be able to renew an EU passport in the place where I actually live
EU member states
Why are you asking
I’m very sure this situation is not unique for country combination or people
I'd say Juncker, we basically just chased him out and sent him to Brussels
I believe that you should have a right to decide over the politics of the country you reside in
It also makes sense in an ever mire globalised world and the especially interconnected countries of Europe
I'd also say that this could help against the rise of far right populism because I rather doubt that immigrants are all that happy with xenophobic rhetoric
Non di Jëfft nach mol - when someone isn't behaving

My native language - no
My husband's native language - no
The language of the country we both live in - no
Sometimes it's a challenge to find native speakers within the respective country
It's mostly English everywhere
Occasionally some of the other big languages like German, French, Russian
I live in Luxembourg and for work reasons I was in 5 different countries in one day: Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands
It’s so easy
Shitty roads, amazing beer and friendly Walloons
We would have access to the sea if it weren't for those meddling Belgians

Well, that was a mistake
Well y'all have Belgium, WI
wait a minute
During the day my room is about 21-23 degrees
In the morning and during the night 15-18 degrees
20-23\*C depending on how far from radiators or windows the thermometer stands
We don't even use all the radiators that are in the apartment and ones we do use are not full on, both right now and in colder winter too
The best option for unsafe places is to have that special wallet you toss to the mugger, one with a few shops client cards without your name, expired better, a bit of coins, some notes not too much
Believable but not your whole life in it
I was driving through a small town somewhere in the middle of Poland
There was a family waiting by zebra crossing
I stopped
They looked at me like I had 2 heads
Crossed
The father almost kissed the ground in front of my car
I looked at them like they had 2 heads
Clearly they never expected a car to stop
Definitely Schueberfouer, it dates back to October 1340 created by John the Blind (John I of Luxembourg, king of Bohemia)
It is the biggest fair in Luxembourg and the Greater region, one of the largest in whole Europe with annually over 2 million visitors within 3 weeks

I could maybe buy an apartment when I'm lucky
Usually you don't get real estate in Luxembourg under 500k.
There's event that thing called Paris syndrome - extreme disappointment after a visit to Paris
Fun fact : Diacetylmorphine aka heroine was discovered by felix hoffmann
Albert hofmann ( swiss ) discovered lsd
Our capital has a quarter that's at the bottom of a valley and is simply called Grund (ground)
Another quarter is called Neudorf (new village), coincidentally also in a valley
Yep, the city has a lot of valleys
Pros: High wages, very easy to visit France, Germany or Belgium, some nice castles, many languages spoken by the entire population, politics are not nearly as divise as in other countries, economy is doing well and the future looks pretty bright
&#x200B;
Cons: Constant and I mean CONSTANT construction sites everywhere, nightlife is pretty lame, a lot of trafic, the country (esp the north) is not well connected even though it's pretty small
It has already been dealt with to an extent and our economy is diverse enough to take a beating
Also it’s not an issue because we are a sovereign country and we can decide how we want to collect taxes
It’s perfectly legal and nobody can argue otherwise because there are no international guidelines on how to collect taxes
We are certainly not an island somewhere in the ocean that belongs to the UK
Housing and rent prices
It gotten so BAD that lots of young people live in Belgium or Germany because they cant afford it
Believe me
Its worse here
Depends on how you look at it I guess
Some trace our state, the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, as far back as 963, when Count Siegfried obtained the "Bockfiels" and a castle called " Lucilinburhuc" from the monastery in Trier in exchange for some land around what is today Liège in Belgium (if I am not mistaken)
We existed as a county in the HRE for some time and also a dynasty, known as the Luxembourg dynasty, ruled the HRE, Bohemia and apparently Hungary for some time between 1308 and 1437
The fate of Luxembourg was linked to the city and fortress of Luxembourg
I could say more about the general history of it, but that would go to far
The state we know today has really been born in the year 1839, when we got our independence because a treaty inside the family (Nassau-Family-pact ?), that ruled the Netherlands at the same time, forbade an female heir to the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, which ended the personal union between the Dutch and the Luxembourgish
Something like that
A few years back I would have been able to answer this question a lot better, but since then I needed the space in my brain for other stuff
So here have some wikipedia links with some more general info of those topics I mentioned briefly:
963
Count Siegfried I ( founder of the house of luxembourg, but which has NOTHING to do with dynasty of Luxembourg/Nassau, our current monarchs ) bought Lucilinburhuc ( little castel ) on the Bockfels, which today is in Luxembourg City ( also the name of the country originated from there )
1354 — its now a dutchy
After 1815, its a grandduchy
Real indepence so to say comes in 1890  ,  when the personal union with Willhelm I of Netherlands ended ( sexist reasons) and the current monarchy ruled
Before this, Luxembourg was ruled by HRE ( some emperors in 15 century where from House of Luxembourg), Spanish Netherlands, Personal union with Netherlands
Also 2 short occupations by our lovely neighboors in the 20th century;)
Luxembourg today is the only Grandduchy to exist and as Liechtenstein, a relict from the HRE
Situated between France and Germany, which led to a few nasty disputes in the 19th century
Also from 15—1850 approx, Luxembourg was known as the Gibraltar of the North due to massive fortifications of the main city — it was destroyed because F and DE wanted it, you can see the remnants as the Kassemattes and a few walls in L. City
This strategic value as buffer was the main reason because were indepent today and not absorbed in France or Germany
In Luxembourg you either know someone with a van and ask them for a favour (like we do for almist everything) or you rent one
I don't know many people who drive around with drywall, construction enterprises are the only ones and they all drive around in vans
Moving couches, as said, you either have connections or you rent
A lot of people will also just get creative and with enough imagination most things fit into regular cars
Yes
It was a nightmare because of the god awful kitchen and teacher wasn’t the nicest
Does most of people know how to cook
I'm a US citizen from birth, but I'm a Luxembourg citizen thanks to their citizenship-by-ancestry program
I did not have to learn Luxembourgish
I know that a nation's language is important to its cultural identity, but I think there are cases where learning it shouldn't be necessary
For instance, I speak French, so I have no issue interacting with my countryfolk
For me, learning Luxembourgish would occupy mental resources and might ultimately detract from my ability to contribute to the economy
But in a country like Germany, where the national language is used in the workplace, I think learning the language should be mandatory
tldr, learning the language should be required only when you can't function in society without it
I pretty much know everyone in the neighbourhood and am acquainted to most of them
There's a lot of Portuguese immigrants in the street so we all get along very well
We also throw a neighbourhood party every year in May, where everyone is invited to come to the party organizer's yard and eat lunch/dinner
That's about it in Luxembourg
In 2008, the Grand Duke vetoed a law that would have legalized euthanasia, so Parliament amended the constitution to take away his legislative power
The tv series Battlestar Galactica used the word 'frack' as a replacement for 'fuck'. Completely unrelated but that word is an often used actual swear word in Luxembourgish
Because they were afraid to actually call some kind of demon they don't know exists and don't know how to sent it back where it came from
Even if they don't believe demons exist in the first place
Err on the safe side
Luckily the new Dublin bus  didn't show up there
The linguistic origin goes back to the german 'verrecken' which means 'to die a wretched death', but it is used the same as 'fuck' though with no sexual conotation and not in verb form
Maybe they are stuck in some cinema space somewhere
Of course
We call them Frittebuud
Came here to say this
Legend
Most of our contribution is historical
Being a founding member of the EU, housing a lot of institutions and having housed the Union as a whole back in the days
Of course I should also mention that the Schengen agreement is named after the Luxembourgish town it was (partially, it was on tge German border) signed in
I guess the Benelux nations can claim to be the spiritual fathers of the Union as a whole
Founding members of the ECSC:
Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany
Luxembourg is more like one big suburb when it comes to how it feels like
The country has hundreds of towns though
Most have less then 10k inhabitants but what do you expect in a country of 600k people
Benelux area
This doesn't fully apply to Luxembourg but Belgium and the Netherlands are the most densely populated countries on earth
As said, most of Luxembourg feels like one suburb
There are tons of villages with barely three people living there but they are never more then 5 minutes by car apart from each other
Not quite
Most of the North is but forests and fields
It's complicated
I'd suggest geoportail
lu as the best mapping tool for Luxembourg
You can swap it to English and they got all kinds of maps, probably giving you the best possible overview of it all you'll get without visiting
Odd, the English wikipedia page on Vetrov doesn't seem to mention Scheer at all
The mayor of our third largest city did renovation works on his backyard shed without approval from the Ministry of Environment
He was forced to resign as both mayor and MP
12 municipalities have town/city status
Not restricted to just one nationality but in many European countries I've been to the locals ask "are you a jew
" If you're stingy or overly concerned about money
Mentioning only the ones that were not mentioned here already
We have some of those Latvia too but apparently translated from other languages
Pay in Polish money = steal
Dressed like an English lord = very well dressed
Annoying like a Lithuanian beggar
Safe as in a Swiss bank
Smart as a Jew
Mongolian tugrik = worthless currency
Tokyo = far away place
Same here, we have a similar character, who's completely black and he is knows for punishing bad children by whipping the with branches
Thank God none as said something against it for now
Remich had a new gare routiere installed a few years back, so that’s something
My dad calls me "Quetschi" which is the cute form of prune
and my mom used to call me "Mausi", cute form of mouse lol
Cigarette littering
Agree 100% but I have a question
I was born and raised in the states so I was circumcised at birth
My question is this: is circumcision mostly a "my loss" sort of thing, or will potential partners (either women or gay men) be turned off by it
Idk really but everyone does it
More fines and biodegeagable filter should be mandatory
Or smoke with joint filters:)
Thats sadly only a part of the problem
Tobacco accumulates heavy metals and radioactive elements while growing,  also Nicotine itself is toxic for the environnement
At the Attert there is the Kropemann
It's a man living in the river and when children come to close to the river and don't pay attention, he hooks them in
Nowadays the tale is used as an excuse for the Kropemannsfest a festival in Redange and to sell you baguettes with a hook there
I'm losing my mind over this, people don't drink their own alcohol
I've lived in Luxembourg, UK, Netherlands and people always drink their own stuff at a party
I've never been to a party in Luxembourg where you brought your own drinks
That's not really a custom here
The Red Lion sucks though
A flag should be simple, a kindergartner should be able to draw it
Try that with the red lion
How many tails
Are they split or not
And what's with the boner
Red-White-Blue forever
Yeah, the Luxembourgish flag sucks, I hope we change that one already
Something
with Afri-Cola
/r/whereisthis/
Ha, it's "Kaweechelchen". Try pronouncing that
No idea about the origin of the name though
Kaweechelchen coming from Kau Eicheln meaning an animal that eats Nuts (acorn) And I see that it could be pretty difficult for non native speakers
Eggs go in the fridge
Never seen any other way
I thought it was Americans who didn’t keep eggs in the fridge
My line is rather between plane and car
I find trains very stressful because:
I have to watch out for my stop, for the transit stop, for any foreign language announcements that go something like "if you are travelling to A destination, you have to be in B numbered carriage, the others will go to C or to depot". Mind the name of A destination is one of 10 the city has in different languages and not necessarily the one I know, I have forgotten which number carriage I was on, if my destination is not A then I have to know at least 2 different lines to deduct if my stop is on the way to A or to C. Also too often trains just stop at a small town in the middle of nowhere and announce they are not going any further, do what you want, if they feel generous they give you a bottle of water
At midnight, after travelling the whole day, when you expected to be at your destination by afternoon
Luggage
Kinda there is no restriction, but how much can I carry
And you have to leave your suitcase far away from your seat and just hope somebody doesn't mix it with theirs
Tags don't help if "mixing" happens on purpose
This is mostly about Belgian and somewhat about German trains
In Latvia trains are reliable and spacious
So I go by plane if it's just me and stay at the destination short time, which means I only have a small luggage, short parking time at the airport, short dog and child sitter time
If it's a longer vacation and involves hauling over family (kids, dogs, side gig stuff) which would mean tickets for all people, expensive tickets and restrictions how many dogs can be on a flight, lots of luggage to manage, then I go by car
Stuff them all in job done
So far I mostly used the plane but not because I like it
Sadly it remains cheaper for a lot of places and I mostly crossed larger bodies of water when travelling in Europe to go to Crete, Ireland, England, Mallorca and Finnland
For other trips I travelled a lot by car and camper to places like Brittany and Denmark
I plan to start train trips after the pandemic however and visit places like Barcelona and Prague making travel by train more convenient
In my opinion you can't draw a proper line between train and plane by distance because it really depends on train tickets and network density
Depends on the length of the trip as take-offs are the most damaging part of the flight
Taking a huge metal bird into the air is incredibly energy intensive while flying at great heights is comparatively tame and thus over long distances planes can win out against cars
It is really difficult to give ultimate statements though as it also really depends on how many people are in the car
A little bit the Second World War when the country had a real enemy that re-enforced the national identity
Apparently I have quite the Luxembourgish accent but Juncker became president of the european commission with on so whatever
In Luxembourg we speak french and german fluently but we have a luxembourgish accent in both
German people react by ignoring the accent most of the time
Sometimes they ask us where we're from and then give us compliments on how good our german is
In Belgium its exactly the same with the french language
French people however immediatly tell us that we re not french, that we have a strong accent, that it sounds funny and so on
If we say a mistake, most people mock us on that too and dont take us seriously
We got Fausti
He is one of our most famous musicians but it isn't very serious music
I think they are around a long time, decades, even cheap ones have this double function
yeah the eyeball spoon thing was really weird
Latvia: men shake hands but women usually not
I have managed to avoid handshakes for many years
Luxembourg city, the capital of Luxembourg country: I live about 5 km from work
That would take me 10-20 minutes by car but as the government doesn’t allow car parkings any more I have to go by bus and that takes me at least an hour and a half each way
Not possible by bicycle as part of the short way is up a cliff like up a wall
The same for walking: in rain or dark that cliff is a killer
Would have to go around and that ads distance
Also totally relay on car for all food shopping
I walk or take the bus everywhere
Love it and not tempted at all to consider getting a car
I have a yearly travel card and that’s it
No need to pay on spot or scan anything
Cash, card or you can send a text
Although public transport will be free here soon
We're making public transport free in March and I haven't had to pay for it in years, so I actually don't really know
Being asked if that isn't a part of Germany happens nearly never but when someone asks it the blood starts boiling
He means the cherry plum, or mirabelle
I don't care for football but I'll be there when we get you for calling it soccer
You just can't do that
More seriously now, in general any sport has the potential to end in violence once alcohol gets involved
In Europe, basketball and handball can be quite popular depending on the region, even ice hockey in a more limited circle
There's however not much to be said about Europe as a whole there and violent fans are rare outside of the world of football
In Luxembourg football is untouchable, especially among Portuguese communities, followed by basketball
Cycling is also extremely popular in the country but the Tour de France isn't known for hooligans
And it was a Dutch who first translated Japanese into a European language
He documented Hiragana and so on
Edit: The Portuguese were the first, however around 3000 loanwords from Dutch were used at some point and several remain today
There even was a study called 蘭学, which translated to Dutch learning
Oh you‘re right, I‘m sorry
I will edit it
Learning Luxembourgish isn't easy because there aren't enough courses to do so
It is hard to fit in like you where born in Luxembourg, however nobody will ever care
Our capital is becoming increasingly English speaking so French is loosing importance making it more immigrant friendly
In general people here do prefer to speak Luxembourgish, but we are so used to speaking four different languages all the time that immigrants should have a manageable situation
Luxembourg is however hyper unfriendly to everyone when it comes to housing
No, Monday is not a day off
However, I get credited 1 extra day off to use when I please
Bare minimum once, average twice, often 3 or 4 times depending
I'm a personal trainer
People often joke about the northern part of Luxembourg which is called Oesling or Eisleck (in Luxembourgish)
Its 30% of the country but compared to the rest not much people living there
We often joke that the only things that exists there are incest, hayfields and forest
They also got only one big road and have a weird accent
The other part of the country is called "Gudland" which literally means "Good Land", I mean this says enough
*This was written by the Gudland Gang*
> > _"Gudland"_
Dude, you can't even spell "Guttland" (English orthography: "Gutland") correctly
This proves why Éislek-people are better ;D
Jokes aside, the main reason why the North is still so sparsely populated is that there are laws in place, that prevent small towns from growing as fast as they could
Which is a shame, because keeping these places artificially small just adds to the shortage on the housing market
I thought the national consensus would be looking down on Esch-Alzette
The only one I can think of that's actually in Luxembourgish:
[Ech Wees Et Nik-Weakonstruction]
[Bommeleeër Affär] stuff for some serious spy films and conspiracy theories
i can tell you that the tram in luxembourg is absolutely unnecessary
>I know that Luxembourg is a country and a region of Belgium
Yes because it used to be part of Lux but after the belgian revolution, belgium gained its independence from the netherlands and we didnt
(in a first step)
We even wanted to be a part of belgium because we also fought with them in the revolution
However Luxembourg was property of the dutch King (we werent part of the netherlands, we were his private property)
And because of Luxembourg he was part of the german bund
Furthermore he had the status of a grand-duc in the german bund
Luxembourg back then was splitted in half
The one half spoke french and the other one a very early version of luxembourgisch, considered as luxembourgish german
After the revolution they gave the french speaking part belgium
So we didnt gain our independence and we also lost 50% of our land
But no worries we will reconquer the province de luxembourg in a first step (simply put luxembourgers there who live there and then claim the land, the same what putin did with the crimea and yes its already happening) and after that a BeNeLux Country under great luxembourgish rule will be established
And then it will be about to conquer the Ruhrgebiet in germany
After this the country should be strong enough to start establishing a european country, under luxembourgish rule of course
All according to our old plan which still lies in the drawer of our grand duc
I feel offended
We are small but we exist
I think we in Luxembourg officially have a "high consumption" of cigarettes and alcohol apparently but it is mostly outsiders buying them
If you pay like 2€ less per pack, it does add up
It is absolutely not unnecessary, traffic in Luxembourg city is already a disaster today
In future it‘s even gonna be worse
The tram is one of many solutions to this problem
Your sin shall never be forgotten
For the longest times (decades), last year highschool students had to read *La Peste* by Camus and Goethe's *Faust*
Other common reads in the last 2-3 years of highschool include *L'étranger* (Camus), *Das Parfüm* (Süskind), *Die Verwandlung* by Kafka and, in English, *1984* and *Of Mice and Men*
Interesting, we read a lot of the same books
Faust, Die Physiker, Jugend ohne Gott etc
In the last year of secondary education we read "Der Trafikant” as well
Have you ever heard of that book
It's not common, and almost always it's either the long hair and beard viking combo, or it's the hipster/hippie man bun thing
I don't know how any individual personally feels about anybody else's hair, it's hard to imagine it being a point of interest let alone concern, but in terms of how "society" views them it's not a social issue
We are all tax criminals, rich af and spoiled
Stop it please
we're a microstate
A rather small state
Ok, I'll bite (USA/Chicago)
* Great health insurance
* On-site breakfast and lunch
* Unlimited time off
* Gym stipend
* Phone stipend
* Company laptop
* $60k salary
* $10k/year of company stock
Edit: This is not representative of most Americans
My benefits are better than ~95% of the country
Yeah I think unlimited time off is mostly a benefit for the employer since they don't have to pay out when the employee leaves the company
Luxembourg because I'm a dual citizen (US/LU)
Nope, large multinational corp
The major downside is that my work-life balance is wack
I work 50-hr weeks
it's very difficult for me to relax, too
i feel like im constantly at risk of losing my job and going into debt
a health savings account is an account that you can put money into to pay for medical expenses
The money is taken out of your paycheck pre-tax, so you get like a 30% savings by using it
Yeah
I'm planning to move to Europe in the next year or two
I'm just so exhausted at the end of the day
It'll be hard to give up the salary though
I do, but I also have student loan debt
I'm surprised - didn't know it was state to state
I just want to escape the hyper-capitalist culture of my homeland
I'm constantly on edge and feeling like I'm one misstep away from homelessness
Honestly for me the one defining moment in German history would be the unification of Germany in 1871
WW1 and it’s consequences are super important as well imo
That's so specific
What about other kinds of parties

Well, with a cold draft you can catch a cold even when it's 40 degrees

Most museums in Luxembourg city are quite nice but it will depend on your preferences
My personal opinion is that historical museums are the speciality thanks to the casemates of our fortress the history museum Dräi Eechelen and the City museum
In the rest of the country there is our museum for military history in Diekirch, however it is completely about the battle of the bulge and the mining museum in Rumaldange, among others
If you visit with a larger group, I think you can do tours around the fortress of Luxembourg but only with rendez-vous
My most recommended museum is the Musée national d'Histoire et d'Art, a wonderful museum filled with historical artefacts and art
Other art museums include the Villa Vauban for painting from the 17th to the 19th century and the Mudam for contemporary art
The last remaining museum I would recommend is our museum for natural sciences
There is 0 KFC in Luxembourg but quite a few on the borders from other countries
Netherlands
"nice petrol station", at least its something :(
Legalization of marijuana and gay marriage and free public transportation for everyone
I think the news already made the round but in Luxembourg all public transport is free, this includes train, bus and tram
The system was implemented about a year ago on the first of March 2020
Travelling first class still costs you and I think it is priced at 8 or 6 Euro for a day ticket
Before last year it was still incredibly cheap
First, all public transport worked on a unified ticket and there were absolutely no controls in buses anyway, second public transport was free for everyone under the age of 20 already back then
Those that had to actually buy a ticket bought either a two-hour ticket for 2 Euros or a day ticket for 4
If you took a train without ticket, no fine was enforced but you had to buy a ticket at a higher (still laughable) price
I still know that it was a ticket for 5 bucks but can't remember if it was a two-hour ticket or a day ticket
There were also tickets for an entire year and there were carnets with tickets for a week at a reduced price I can't remember
Hello friend
I really don't understand how the DB can commit the atrocious act of being terrible and expensive
I use the Belgian rail every two weeks and I profit greatly from the Go-pass
For 6,90 euro you can travel from any Belgian station to another given you're under the age of 26
A cross a border on my journey raising the price 2 bucks
Buying tickets inside a train also raises the price for about 2 bucks except when the controller is especially friendly
Side note, I'd like to ask a Belgian, how do you perceived the SNCB as my experience with them has been exceptionally well so far
The worst thing about German rail is that it doesn't even get better while getting more expensive
Germany is the bane of transeuropean railway networks but the DB still asks high prices
Is the company completely private or in a government coop
Strange
I regularly pass Liège and it doesn't seem to be that way there even though its among Belgium's largest urban areas
How do you manage to get a government run railway this shitty
Luxembourg's rail is also always late and some trains get cancelled outright but they come at least once per hour, are usually replaceable by bus on its free
I'm not familiar with the SNCF
The only thing I know is that Germany's "high-speed" rail is a joke when you compare it to the TGV without knowing the difference in price
A TGV's top speed is nearly double that of Germany's ICE
If you don't know, you should never privatise rail
The privatisation of rail is among the greatest failures of neoliberalism because competition doesn't work on a railway network were only one train can pass at a time
Privatising infrastructure is pure stupidity
As said, no experience with the French trains
A TGV can go up to 574
8 km/h
The most popular TV channel is RTL (Radio, Telé, Lëtzebuerg)
They’re not necessarily the best but they are pretty good overall
Yeah I'm okay with that, but we want to keep the tax haven status if that's fine with y'all
Desperanto so to say
Our national monument
Belgium
Latvian: 1-10 have unique names, similar to most other European languages
11-19 all say a bit shortened version of "last number over 10". From 20 on: two tens, three tens, etc
21 = two tens one and then the same pattern till 99 = nine tens nine
4x20 wouldn't be too bad, it's confusing as it literally says 4 20 and without enough context no way to know if it's 80 or 4,20
In my home town the old barracks now house asylum seekers
I think in Bastogne they got a nice second live by being refurbished into a history museum
Did not expect that someone names my mother tongue
I'd rather describe Luxembourgish as a Germanic language with a lot of French loanwords (History and all)
The Dutch angle probably has to do with the fact that both languages has the same ancestor
Either way: Glad you like hearing our language
English should be everybody's first language, you can learn and speak your historical language as an academic or cultural practice
Look around the world
It's more important that we are able to communicate well, than that such and such language is preserved as a living language
No joke, we have their mailbox but no single store
Luxembourg has none
But Belgium has one right next to the border with Luxembourg
And in this context, "right next to" can be understood as "Their secondry parking lot can't be square, otherwise it would cross the border"
Luxembourg has Nobel Prize winners
I just googled them and I am amazed by those guys
For Ukraine I'd say probably Lenta za Lentoju (Лента за Лентою) which I think is a patriot song from the second world war though I could be wrong
Most meat we eat is eather beef, pork or chicken, but you can also find other meats like duck, horse or rabbit in supermarkets or on restaurant menus
Not unusual but I would say that rabbit is the least found though

A lot of italian, french and asian restaurants
There are also some American one and Indian
Luxembourg
You're welcome
If it does break up then there will be only England out of EU, the rest may well hurry back in
Yes, but seems the Brexit they voted for was not the same they got
We have our own language in Luxembourg
It draws it’s origin in the old German, so it’s pretty close to what German and Dutch are today, but different enough as well
You’re definitely a troll, the said amount is only the money going out, there is also money coming in as well and then there are other services granted by the EU that make up for it for a large portion
I did partake in this tradition once, though not in Germany but in Luxembourg as that’s where I live
I was surprised to learn of it when I was invited to another luxembourgish Household who does partake as well
Yes most of us speak luxembourgish daily, it’s taught in the early schools years too if a family happens to not know it
Would like to visit
The touristy places seem tempting
Maltese Victory Day combines many great historical victories
But I know a few dozen Maltese people from work
Strangely impolite: they don’t exchange greetings in office corridors although we have talked and know each other by name
I stopped greeting them after a few years meeting them regularly like every week or so
Looks that was acceptable
Damn, you were ready to go with that information
Well formulated by Macron
As others have said already, it's sad that he even has to defend these fundamental values but some people apparently haven't understood what it *means* to be living in a country like France
Good

Perfect Brexit Metaphor
A fish rots from the head down
In Luxembourg we had the same problem with the 2015 referendum
One of the three questions asked was if foreigners should have a right to vote
Since we have almost 50% foreigners living in Luxembourg  my thoughts were that this would be a good thing, but the question in the referendum was so stupidly asked (like "should foreigners have the right to vote
"), with no further explanations given what this would mean, that at the end only 21% voted for
One of the goals of the referendum was to get the right to vote for foreigners
And 21% is a shame in my opinion (as a european)
But people were just told, by populist and conservative parties that the foreigners would take something away from them
Funny fact is, that foreigners would only have been able to vote (after a positive referendum) after having lived here for at least ten years
Google luxembourg referendum 2015
Well I guess in the Cities it's like 80% and in rural areas around 30%
Rightly so

Prague is a beautiful city

We've had a tiny bit of snow in Munich 2 days ago
I don't remember when was the last time when it snowed this early
Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité!
I got this reference
In Luxembourg all public transportation will be free in March 2020
We are a small country, but it's a good start
Where are all these polls made
I mainly use it to cut my cigars
Ha, joke's on you, Luxembourg-City's river has **two** syllables
Soundtrack : Blood Fire Death by Bathory /m/
Pff, we use *Paräis*. Yep, we added an umlaut in Luxembourgish
On the other hand compromise in a two party system would be stupid beyond belief
Imagine if Biden were to make compromises and take up talking points from Trump
The problem however isn't that compromises are bad but that a two party system is horrible
I favour different viting systems but the French two round system for the presidential election does its job quite well
Proportional voting also works out well
Belgium just went through the worst outcome of a proportional voting system not having a standing government for nearly two years, yet they are doing fine
Just because a system "works" doesn't mean its good
Absolute monarchy works to a certain extent
A two party system is a functional form of governance, however not a particularly democratic one
Limiting a democracy into two options is horrible
Claiming that such a system limits extremism is also bollocks, see Trump's victory
Coalition building fulfills a similar purpose when it comes to the formation of a government while discourse and debate in a parliament are a positive thing and thus even extreme opinions should be allowed to a certain degree if tgey are representative
Having permanent consensus can also be damaging to public discourse
It represents both stability and stagnation
When it comes to America the better of the people also used to exclude an awful lot of the people
Belgium didn't leave the Paris agreement and there were no riots on the street
The system contributes to that problem though

I was 18 years old and I remember very well that the girl I was dating back then was in paris that night
I was able to contact her for the entire weekend and I remember that I was hell
She wasnt hurt or anything but I didnt know that

I get the meme, but some of yous don't seem to understand how thoroughly Kanye tarnished his own brand over the last few years, even just through his politics

> I made the point that China is a more reliable/predictable partner than the US currently
And I think he licked you pretty good in response
China is a dictatorship
Of course it is "reliable" and "stable
" That's what every dictatorship sells itself on
Do you really want the tumult of elections every four years
Or do you want "stability"? The Swiss might call us more reliable if you accept my rule
Let's stop using the word "cancel", nobody knows how to use it and it doesn't apply here
People do remember things
Kanye should actually hope that they do, because he was much more likable in the past both sonically and as a person
The guy is a household name and still got laughed off the stage running for president
He needs a complete rehabilitation of his image and health to even warrant discussion
A well-lit speedbump tbf
Everyone would prefer the Italians, except of course French people
That's the reason why Italian cuisine is better (imo), simple, cheap to make and tastes awesome

France has like 60 nuclear reactors,but they are old and many of them need renovations

Really the shortest

Of course there are haha
I just don't happen to have an accent which is sad
Pssssssssssh ! Tell this no one about this problem
This [one] is much more intersting
That's not true at all
True, but people don't usually go around and confront people with those stereotypes upon meeting them
Lots of people don't think about that
Some don't even know where Luxembourg is exactly but they know it's something with "banks and taxes". Nice to meet you too lol
Thank you for including Luxembourgish !
think you're right, Germany would newer just hang bicycles and leave them on display that's just wasteful
They would melt them and build tanks

Well China is most likely lying about it
**I think Germany, Austria, BeNeLux and the Northern countries should help the South deal with the virus crisis and the economic crisis which would follow**
Let's discount the effect of artificial economics such as the common market and tariffs from the US/China etc
Europe is so well connected and dense
To ship all those Mercedes, BMWs, Volkswagen
over to the US, China, Japan
that's much more expensive .
This is just one example of many . You want your trading partners to do well
**That said, the whole thing is enraging because the South thinks they are in the right and they are perfect, and the North is evil and bad
As in every system if you tune it down the social hatred towards rich people, they'd do the right thing on spontaneusly
Because it's in their own interest to do so when they project themselves in the future**
**Attacking and shaming rich people and countries would always make them focus on the present and prevent them to focus on the future and do the right thing (for them and for you
and for the EU) , the South should recognize their errors and humbly ask help to the North, having people from Germany and Denmark come over to do courses and form personnel in the Public Administrations, and efficiency in general**

As far as I know in my country polls about religion are not allowed
I totally agree muslims are disliked because of their ideology instead of the terrorism
I would find it totally unacceptable for my daughters to be in a relationship with a muslim because of Islam's build-in suppression of women
I also make absolutely sure that my daughters are aware of this
I would even have difficulties trusting atheists with a muslim background for that matter
Any other human (race, gender, ...) would be totally acceptable
Sometimes I need these kinds of posts to assure me that I'm not completely fucked (not yet, anyway) because no one ever seems to mention Europe when it comes to these things
As it is the newest poll it could be a direct reaction to the nomination of Laschet as the Union's candidate for chancellor even though it probably still is of from the current actual average as the shift from older polls is massive
Robert Habeck recently published a book outlining clear criticism towards capitalism and the Greens always had the most overlap with die Linke at least according to both parties' manifestos
I am pretty confident that they would go for G-R-R were they to become largest party after the election
Programmatically they are nearly incompatible with the Union and the Greens could establish themselves as the single center party if the CDU were to actually loose the election by a significant margin, a move not possible within a coalition with them
Not siding with the Union could however also lead to that parties further downfall leaving the Greens without peers
Concerning the Greens willingness to go through with their program, I think that's a thing nobody can tell

We actually have a lot of tourists each year
Luxembourg is actually pretty popular for People who want to do a roadtrip through western europe
We have the lowest gaz prices and a very good connection the autobahns of our neighbours
And you can catch a direct train to Paris, Bruxelles, Cologne, Francfort, Nancy and some other cities
Most people you make a stop here in Luxembourg use the time to visit the city or the southern part of the country
But yeah honestly there are better places to visit
Oh an btw the most tourists that come here each year are from the netherlands
They all come camping here, I dont even know why, I mean Luxembourg and the netherlands are pretty similar
The only difference is the language and the fact that we have some tiny mountains
Now honestly why do so fricking many dutch people spend their money for a vacation in Luxembourg  each year

No, because Luxembourg is part of Benelux

I haven't been to Vilnius in a few years, but even as somewhat of a scrooge, I never had a problem finding good bars with cheap beer in the city center
I live in a big American city now and miss those cheap nights out

What's upboat
The worst part is the drivers
How come 100% of people in Belgium are genuinely awful in cars
I do
I just find a lot of bad drivers from Belgium
Maybe just luck

I would think more like 20
We were 13 and I can imagine it's the case in many villages
Pretty much anyone in Europe
As a Belgian my father had a very extensive comic book collection and I read them all
Asterix, Le petit Spirou, Gaston Lagaffe, Tintin, Spirou & Fantasio, Le Scrameustache, Blake & Mortimer, Lucky Luke, Les Schtroumpfs, Boule & Bill, Achille Talon, Buck Danny, Léonard, Chick Bill, Ric Hochet, Yoko Tsuno, Les Tuniques Bleues, XIII, Largo Winch, Les petits hommes and many more
Pretty much my whole childhood revolved around comics
Yeah the machinery was very well drawn, I also loved the multi part story arcs they were great
Why is there data from Lichtenstein but non from Luxembourg
That offends me
What war(s) was Luxembourg involved in and how exactly
Maybe during the yugoslavian wars
*suffocates in British*
If it's free then you're the product
Nobody speaks about the over 10 million Russian people that died in the War
Thats because if it weren\`t Russia everybody would be speaking German,also the Russians and post-Soviet countries are still suffering greatly from the Deaths in the War
They joined the war because Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the US declared War on Japan,and then Germany declared war on the US,even if they didn\`t have too
But the US was more busy with the Pacific War then with Europe
True, USA is one win and one draw vs England in the World Cup
I hate that for foot wear it's always Italy that's used

Germans could probably beat that number, and we share a border with them
Only 3% didn't hear about us
Hell yeah bois; we're famous
same goes for american english
Same in Luxembourg
That's what their president speaks right
I think A2 comes close
Benelux is the reason why we got so many products including a Dutch description here in Luxembourg
When I was a kid I never understood as nobody here speaks Dutch
It‘s because some of our products are exported to Belgium/Holland as well while others are imported from there
Im glad i live in luxemburg
As long as you can tell it apart from out (correct) flag I'm good
The Luxembourg alternate flag is so much better than our official one :/
And the train link from Brussels to Luxembourg
Silver lining: we were more homogeneous language wise after that
Hi there, compatriot
There’s literally 3 of us on reddit, ha
Now that we’re done with the formalities: That alternate flag is called *Roude Léiw* (red lion), you peasant

I thought this was new corona cases for a second
A friend of mine and I like to travel to your country (Sweden, for those who don't see the flair) for canoe trips every couple of years
This year should have been our 10 year "anniversary" but Corona had other ideas
It may not seem long ago but even here, we used to have mixed weather on our trips, sunny days, rainy days, and rarely temperatures over 25 degrees
The last two times we went though the temperatures were more often above 25 than they were below and one time we weren't even allowed to make fire (2018) because it hadn't rained in like 2 months
The water level on the lake was well below normal judging by the coastlines, there were way less mosquitos and other nuisances on the bright side but yeah
weird being in Sweden and having south of France weather for weeks at a time
Thanks god for that
Went to the US for a 2 week vacation and got a SIM card there
Got robocalls  probably every other day
Luxembourg has passed that for sure
The Findel is a rather cold spot, so for anyone along the Mosel river, it must have passed the 40 mark
Hey luxembourgish person here, we had above 40° C yesterday , we were at about 40,5°
More like Korrem with a throaty 'r'.
I don't understand some of this
Why go all the way back to proto-indo-european  for English, German, Dutch, etc
But stop at proto-Italic for French, Italian, Spanish, etc
Seems quite arbitrary
Luxembourg only became a secular state in 2014 and one of our mayor papers was primarily owned by the archdiocese until very recently
Fair point, but a lake in the middle of the sea would be a bit of a waste
I was just about to suggest Belgium so we would have access to the sea, but am changing my choice to France
Smaller coast for us but we get to keep fries
Bit of a hike for Switzerland, isn't it
Tbh we have the recipe for fries, so ...
Um, excuse me ... Can you not all decide to flood us
We have not hurt anyone recently
Plus we have your money hostage
My mom is Belgian and my aunt owns a friterie in Belgium, what do you do now, my family can just take over the entirety of Benelux with that knowledge
OK this is true
Bit hard to flood Scotland, tho
Free public transport
Pretty big thing
Free public transport, I'd say is progressive
Honestly nobody even paid for tickets for years, so it isn't nothing new if you ask me
He's as useless now as he has always been
2-3 years ago there was some ad campaign for charity
Picture of a homeless guy and the text said something like: Poor Paul only gets 4000 (four thousand) euros per month, lets donate to help him and people like him
Minimal wage roughly is half that for qualified workers and 1/3 for non qualified
Hm well people either living in really small flats in the southern cities or northern, working from morning to evening only earning the minimum wage, getting heavy support from the central government or else they most likely will have a really rough time at the end of the month
If you are lucky you live in an apartment which is not too hot in the summer and easy to keep warm in the winter
Sadly many live in really old houses or apartments which need renovations but they lack the money to do it

I can find the flairs but they don't stick on me for whatever reason

I don't really care about my accent
My SOs have said it's cute, native speakers understand, what else one may want
The beautiful thing about English is that even people who have learned only the very basics and have an accent still can be understood
Unlike, for example, French where you make one easy mistake and all sense goes out of the window, even native speakers don't understand, let alone two beginners trying to talk between themselves
Native English speaker here, I find your accent to be absolutely adorable and I wish you felt more comfortable with it
in luxembourg almost everyone has an iphone but i don’t think it’s representative of europe
Same, still have the 3T, but I have been wanting to upgrade for some time now
However all the new models are so ridiculously expensive that I will probably just keep me 3T
Exactly, and as you said, OnePlus is also not exactly cheap anymore:(
Esch-sur-Alzette
Known as the poor, drug, gang and criminal city of Luxembourg
Even though it is not that bad
Please add Bonn
It was overwhelming underwhelming
I was shocked considering it was the former capital of Westgermany
There’s a lot worse in Luxembourg like wayyyy worse
Ettelbruck, Rodange, Petange and Differdange are way worse imo
Lol nah it is the poorest Region in Luxembourg with one of the highest unemployment rate but yeah peasants indeed XD
Uh no
Out of all communes only Reisdorf has more people without a job than Esch
And Reisdorf is really small so
And none of those you mentioned are worse than Esch
Granted Differdange has some social problems too but it is not even close to Esch
Even Ettelbrück, often known as the nordic Esch has waaaaay less problems than Esch
That has way more to do with the demographics of the city rather than the city itself
Edit: Following your logic New York is way worse than North Dakota because it has a higher unemployment level
Source:
Hello it is PERCENTAGES
Not total numbers
Or how would a little commune like Reisdorf has more unemployment than Esch
This is ridiculous
DEMOGRAPHICS dude, not just the number of habitants
Damn
Over 14% of the people in Reisdorf are unemployed, so out of 100 there are around 14 people without work
It is followed by Esch, then Differdange etc
So in Esch there are more unemployed people within 100 than for example Differdange
Another statistic:
2018 Canton Esch unemployment : 7
20%
Esch: 10
10%
Differdange : 8
56%
Dudelange : 6
75%
Pétange : 7
33%
Now tell me how are those Cities and Town worse than Esch
Both in absolute numbers and percentage
Ok now I get it
You don’t know what demographics are
Let me give you a fairly simple example
Esch is one of the cities in Luxembourg with the youngest population
For various reasons (systematic and non-systematic) young people have a hard time finding a job
Thus Esch has one of the biggest unemployment rates which is extremely related to its demographics rather than its infrastructures and/or governance
Now you can agree or not up to you, I don’t really care
Consider this my last message already spent way too much time on this
Edit: basing the quality of a city on its unemployment rate will severely restrain your possible conclusions
Stay stafe
No Differdange and Pétange has a younger population than Esch while only Dudelange has a little older population by an average of merely 1-2 years
Demographic doesn't play a significant role to consider it a possibility
And thanks you stay safe too
Ah yes I can cofirm
I see you are a man of culture as well
Fun fact, there is a region called "Province de Luxembourg" in Belgium, which has the exact same eblem as the grand duchy of Luxembourg
The province de luxembourg is even bigger than Luxembourg
It used to be a part of Luxembourg, but because they were french speaking they became a part of belgium
In the last few years it was discussed to hold a referendum in the province because a lot of belgiums in the province want to be a part of luxembourg, because the province is very poor and because of the political instability in belgium
But Luxembourg was like "Nah fam we re good", because it would have cost too much and of course we didnt want to get our neighbour into political trouble
Yeah but just imagine those belgiums would have actually voted to be a part of the grand duchy, this would have triggered a chain reaction
After this belgium would have probably fell apart
Luxembourg : The one member that keeps everyone together when everyone looses theirs minds

The Rich guy that drives to work in a supercar only to steal his coworkers lunches there
They want to strategically reopen all public schools by May 18
The classes will be divided into two and only one half of the students will go to school and the other one will stay at home doing revision
We have to retake all the tests from the first semester and the first half of the second semester
What’s also bizarre is that they allow the children to not wear masks inside the school building, because the risk of affection is lower apparently
Luxembourg is the only country (EDIT: With Liechtenstein) which was part of the Holy Roman Empire and the German Bund that never became part of the German Reich or the BRD
Luxembourgish is only spoken by 300k people, and eventough its the official language here, its not an official language in the EU
Luxembourg banned everything that looked and sounded too german out of our language after WW2
Luxembourg had a mighty fortess that was called "Gibraltar of the north". It was never conquered but in 1867 we had to destroy it because it nearly lead to a war between the european powers
The Church and the state werent seperated until 2015
The catholic church used to be very powerful they owned the biggest newspaper (luxemburger wort) until 3 months ago
Bonus: We still call the german prussians
Even our politicians call them prussians but only in unofficial speeches
Last existing Grand Duchy
All public transport is free
We won the Eurovision song contest 5 times (3rd best) and we haven't participated since 1994
The Schengen area is named after a pretty insignificant Luxembourgish town at the crossing of our borders with France and Germany where the treaty was signed
ArcelorMittal has its headquarters in Luxembourg making the worlds largest steel producer essentially Luxembourgish
The beams for the New World Trade Center were cast here
We have our own language and don't all speak German like some assume
In total we learn at least four languages at school, Luxembourgish, German, French and English
Wanted to get that out as well
I never knew about 5 what the fuck
>44% of individual income goes to taxes
Isnt this normal
Or is this the case for every income class
In Luxembourg the lower classes pay less taxes but the higher classes have to give 50% of their income away
Yes it is
Ita like serbian and russian, they are similar but at the same time quiet different
My Gf is from serbia and she said that she isnt able to have a conversation with a russian but she is able to guess the topic when she reads russian
Its the same for german and luxembourgish
Germans have a hard time to understand anything that we speak (they often confuse it with dutch) but they can guess the topic when they read luxembourgish
Wow you totally right dude
Ive never tought about this
In school we actually learn that we are the only country
Jesus how ignorant
Its sad that there are no actual pictures left
But the leftovers are still visible today
You can visit them and the underground tunnels are still active
And as the other guy said, its really cool to chill on the leftovers with your friends during summer
>I guess you could say they were part of the German Reich in WW2, but so was Luxembourg
Psshht dont tell this to a Luxembourger, if you do then they reply that its not true, that they never stopped fighting and that the germans were never able to gain fully control of Luxembourg
Oh and they will also paint your house yellow and come and lynch you at night
(that happened to the german collaborators after ww2)
But yeah I get what you want to say
Its different, in germany you spell the "ch" as "ch" in luxembourgish you spell every ch as "sch".
Ich would be spelled Isch in luxembourgish
But to give an example of what exactly I mean:
Dehnen (to stretch) is nearly the same in luxembourgish
But in luxemburgish you would write "Deenen".
Its pronounced nearly the same way, but we simply banned the "H" in those words because its a german thing
(I took dehnen as an example because its nearly the same)
Good question
But to understand this you have to understand the luxembourgish history and its culture
Luxembourg used to be under french and german influence
The rich in Luxembourg town always spoke french, cause they taught it is a superior language
The normal people on the other hand kept speaking their language - > Luxembourgish
Our constitution is in french
Why they havent changed it yet
Because they argue that it would be too complicated to that
Our language had several reforms since WW2, that doesnt make it easier
Eventough we have our own language, most newspapers are still in german or french
(or a mix)
Back when the EU was created (I mean in the 50s but Idk the english word) the debates in our parliament were still held in french
(The same reason -> superior language)
So our gov tought it would be better when we also speak french on the international stage
Nowadays everything is in luxembourgish, but dont expect our governement to change anything
They push french more than our language because they are profiting from it
Most doctors are french and for a lot of luxembourgers it is really hard to express their health problems in french
(me included btw)
So lots of us want that at least them must speak lux
But nope, no way
In fact, in the opinion of our Governement (its a coalition of 3 parties - socialists, greens and liberals) its kind of racist to demand that they speak or understand our language
We have 50% immigrants here, and Im so glad that a lot of them (and I mean a lot) decide by themselve to learn our language, because our gov wouldnt care
More people than ever before are speaking our language, they are not the problem (eventough the british arent willing to learn the language lol)
And yes I understand why its hard for a french frontier worker to learn our language, but then just support and encourage him and dont say "No its racist".
Yes another guy already pointed this out
Its my fault, but we also learn in our school that we are the only country lol
Bold of you to assume we aren't the only Grand Duchy in the world
I think the reason why we learn it is because Luxembourg was heavily connected to prussia
Our militarys were working together and they financed huge parts of our industry
They were pretty pissed when we said that we wont join the Reich and called us a parasite
They even wanted to annex us, but the UK and France guaranteed our independence
(because we destroyed our fortress few years earlier)
In WW1 they wanted to annex us again, but, as you know, they lost
But our Grand Duchesse drank tea with the Kaiser and that lead to a crisis after the war
She was removed from the throne and died few years after that
(she was very young)
In WW2 Hitler said that we are german, have always been germans and will always be germans
He called it "Heim ins Reich".
He wanted to deport 35k Luxembourgers (15% of our population back then) because they werent german enough
The whole country also striked during that time
Back then People started to say: "Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir si, mir wëlle jo këng Praisen gin".
Which means: "We want to stay what we are, no we dont want to become prussians".
The first part of the sentence is still used today and is our national motto
It even has its own wiki page:
And thats probably why we learned that in school, every Luxembourger is damn ass proud that the germans were never able to annex us
When Juncker called the president of Hungary Orban, a dictator and gave him a light smack on the face
But it sounds more like "th" afaik
My natural inclination is to look for my own countryfolk, but I catch myself and make sure I read everyone else's responses too
Often, yes, about 3 x every hour
Those ads and a few documentaries about fighting poachers make an impression that all there is in Africa is sick kids and dying rhinos
Rare and surprising to see there are cities with people who wear something else than tribal attire
Latvia
Soviet era at school when we were allowed a bit of Latvian history (general one was all about USSR) then we had this "700 years of slavery" story as Germans conquered Latvia in early 13th century
Well, Germans of the time and territory of the time
Germans were the landowners and upper class till WW1 when independent Latvia was born
During all that long time people were mixing and mingling, I don't think you can find many Latvians without at least some German DNA, many have German surnames
There were tensions stemming from class differences that translated as national because the class and nation was the same
Germans claimed they brought us culture
We claimed we were better off before they came and could have achieved better if we weren't their colony
German = rich, desirable with a pinch of jealousy
Then right before WW2 Molotov-Ribentrof pact was signed in 1939 and Soviet army occupied Latvia (and other Baltic countries)  in 1940
They also claimed to bring us culture
1940 is called The Terrible Year, Soviet power killed right and left for the fun of it
Ask any family history, there will be lost most of their members in 1940, during WW2 or after it (after
) Killed, sent to die in Siberia
So when German army came in during WW2 they were regarded as saviours
Fight the devil with Belzebul
Simply liked those who killed less
Germany apologized, Germany paid contributions
Russia said we have to be grateful for what it did and kept Abrene region
When finally in the 1990ies we could actually meet Germans in person we didn't have bad feelings
Came as a surprise when some Germans personally apologised both for the 700 years and WW2
We were working together on international project so was wise to clear any old hurt there might be
I told some of the WW2 stories I had heard from grandparents, they told some from their perspective how Russians behaved in occupied Germany
The old Generation: Yes
My Generation: No, we see the germans as our brothers
But yeah the old people still say a lot of racist things against germans
And the germans are still called prussians
Our national motto is: "Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn, mir wëlle jo keng preisen ginn"
Which means: " We want to stay what we are and definitely not become prussians"
But in recent years we and our politicians have only used the first part of the sentence
*We want to stay what we are*
However, when you tell any Luxembourger that their language is german or that Luxembourgers belong to germans they are getting angry af
Its just a thing that you dont say and if you do its even probable that the other one will punch you in the face
(not me)
But during world cups etc, the most young people here Support germany
We also watch german tv and often prefer germans over the french
(dont know why)
EDIT: Its worth mentioning that our problems with germany began in 1867
The following years they often tried to annex us and called us parasites etc
Well in Dutch save is "sparen", so not too far off
Yes
I only drink tap water
I am always surprised when someone doesn't.
I use about two anglicism per sentence
Granted, I use them mostly in certain contexts
There are some topics you hear about so often in English that you just start using the English vocabulary
However I would know most of these words in Luxembourgish too if I took more time before talking
When I start talking French I get real blockades where I can not think about the French but only the English words
Calling us French, German or Belgian just because we're a small country between those three
Or not recognising us as a country at all (We're not a part of Germany
Joking about the size of our country/population/number of people that actually speak Luxembourgish is fine, just don't do that too much or it becomes annoying
Everyone does that and we've heard all the Jokes, so if you have to, just make you fucking joke and move on
Thank you
Same in Luxembourgish, there is no translation for "Netherlands" other than "Holland"
Oh yeah, Luxembourgish people totally were the baddies for being forcibly recruited or being shot for showing resistance against the nazi occupation…
Well we arent and werent german speaking
Hitler want us to speak german but as a Luxembourger you should know what happened
Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn
We're cool here
And now's the time to learn a bit more about Luxembourg ;)
Yes, but we're taught German and French in primary school as well
I'll never deny that there were people against fascism or nationalism in every country at that time
But there's a difference of a nation clearly being the aggressor and a nation declaring war neutrality at the very beginning and still being invaded a few days afterwards
Elo verstinn ech net, wat deng Fro mat mengem Commentaire iwwert den Zweete Weltkrich ze dinn huet… Bréng bësse Klorheet eran mat dénger Ausso, wannechgeliwwt
Nur ein Joke, Brudi
I need to question your premise
Pretty much all data¹ (wiki link below) I can find shows less than 1 year average life expectancy difference between the most developed EU countries
Usually a few decimals
- I can't find the details but you can bet 1 year is likely within margin of error, i.e. it's not necessarily significant
It's also not enough to question "why" as the variations seem tiny in a rather chaotic space — at least, you want to look at longitudinal studies, taking entire generations into account, because a yearly snapshot is clearly too limited to make demographic conclusions
- Life expectancy should be somewhat differentiated from quality of life, the picture is much more complex
Otherwise good luck explaining that longer life expectancy in China than US correlates with *good living*... (there's really much more to this picture, and it's counter-intuitive in some cases)
But again, within a year of difference, it is almost meaningless to compare because simple genetic or tropic variations could explain such small discrepancies (stochastic)
For an exhaustive answer, and a much deeper insight, I would suggest reading for example the Human Development Report² by the UNDP (UN Development Program)
It's a small book (250ish pages) worth of insights on all these things and much more
Link to pdf below
Look at table 1 on page 300 for instance, it paints a slightly different picture than mere life expectancy
Consider table 3 as well (Inequality-adjusted), see the Inequality in life expectancy (6th column)
It's always a partial picture for such multidimensional matters
Also raw life expectancy at birth is far from telling you the whole piture, *healthy* ("health-adjusted" on the Wiki page) life expectancy is much more significant subjectively (how many years without disease), and the difference relates directly to healthcare costs for that age group
You may also find that inequality in education is maybe worse than inequality in life expectancy, and so suddenly Asian countries like HK or Singapore are much less appealing despite their strong showing in development indexes within the European pack
I would tell you that in general, once you've got the tools for the best life expectancy (healthcare system, medical sector well trained, good population habits, etc), it generally comes down to inequalities within a country — because this impacts the richest decile as much as others
You definitely want to take a look at Richard Wilkinson's TED talk *How economic inequality harms societies*³ in that regard (video link below, maybe watch that first)
Complex topic, but Spain, France, Italy, the UK, Ireland or Germany are very much within the same ballpark, not different enough that you'd want to look solely at biological factors (and the Development Index of Ireland must conversely be contrasted by comments in this topic, it's not all roses either
) Let's just admit that for now, we collectively top these charts on Earth, along with a few Asian democracies (Japan, SK, HK, Singapore, etc
It's a shame that Taiwan is not represented in this study)
Just my 2 cts
Also remember no individual is a statistic
You or I wouldn't personally live 4 months more or less if we moved from France to Spain or back, obviously
List of countries by life expectancy:
(This is where China and US sit at 41 and 42 respectively, for reference)

I haven't seen any film where they would try to speak my native language but I also know Russian
There is a clip running on tv right now, I think it's an ad for some film that will be on soon, I'm to busy rolling on the floor laughing to notice what exactly it is
So there's 3 guys in a car crossing a border and a Russian border guard asks for passports:
\- Ваш паспорт!  (\[vash pasport\] your passport)
\- Ваш паспорт! The bearded passenger repeats just slightly off
Border guard:  Это я сказал (\[eto ja skazal\] I said it)
And the passenger mocks him what is supposed to be: Это я говорю (\[eto ja gavarju\] I say it) but what he says sounds like throat gurgling
Whole dialog is 10 words only
The tv we are on repeats this scene every half an hour and my UK husband says they could never come up with a better comedy judging from my reaction
Hearing Luxembourgish, Portugese, English, German, French, Chinese when taking a walk in Luxembourg City
In a short time period
Supermarket is French, Cafe is Portugese, Bank is English, Administration in French, Newspapers in German/French/Luxembourgish
For people not habituated its pure chaos
First thing i can confirm
Yeah here also
I only have met one woman who had some not too convincing arguments against vaccination but she doesn’t have kids, so her opinion doesn’t change much

If you insert the vowels you get Russian četvert (1/4) and smerč (actually a tornado)
Haha, yes, that's true
Summer or winter time I don't care, doesn't matter how the hour is called
Right now we have the same time zone from Lithuania - Poland border to Spain - Portugal border, 3800 km, no way the same hour looks the same all over this huge area
Main thing for me: please stop the constant moving of the clock
All the reasons why it's justified are just BS
And actually it had to stop already, I think March 2020
Or 2019

We joke about reconquering the province de luxembourg in belgium
Fun fact, some years ago the province wanted to join us, but we said no
We also joke about reconquering the german and french parts
Well we even joke about reconquering bohemia and brandenburg
There is already a majority of luxembourgers living on the german and belgium border (in one german village a luxembourger is the mayor) but pshht dont tell them
> reconquering a part of another
Me: *Hold my flag
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I felt like nobody would ever ask
Yeah getting parts of Belgium back lol, they even have the balls to call that entire province Luxembourg and keeping the red lion, scandalous
Don't know about other countryman but from my point of view Trier wouldn't survive without Luxembourgish tourists and so many of them work in our country
By now it belongs more to us then to the Germans
And when we are at it, the Belgium named a province after my country
They are begging for it to be conquered
Sabatons songs about the winter war are better tho
Isnt Orban even "joking" about reconquering greater hungary
(Idk if this is the english word, but I mean the borders from 1920)
Hey belgium, we will help you but give us the province de luxembourg back
Sincerly,
A concerned neighbour
I mean, every european nation is joking about reconquering Konstantinople, especially the catholic ones, because of the crusades
A lot of germans in the west also joke about conquering Luxembourg
(reconquer is the wrong word, we were part of the german bund but we were never part of the german reich or BRD)

But Luxembourg used to be a private territory of your king and not a part of the netherlands
>Luxembourg should have been brought back under the control of the Netherlands in 2013
Nahh sorry mate, but we can divide belgium if you want to
You guys take the northern part and we take the south
Brussels can stay an own country
Rightful Luxembourgish clay
And we should conquer some land including Bitburg back
Lol
Nah, we're using the money to buy Russia
`;)` Easier than defeating Putin directly
I'd love to hear your method to arrest a country though, I've had enough of France and I think they should be arrested before they hurt themselves too much
(hopefully a giant /s is implicit
Didnt he revealed a monument of greater Hungary a few weeks ago
He also said other things that even outraged the prime minister of croatia
There you go:
Yeah just form a country together
*Sad luxembourgish noises
I mean there is nothing called BeNeLux right
As you maybe know, we are already doing this
There are some german villages with luxembourgish majorities on the border
In one village, a Luxembourg is the mayor
In a few years it will be ours, but psshht dont tell them
All according to medieval plan I see, nice
Really
I dont really understand Orbanas politics in general to be honest
(I dont even talk about the immigration politics)
He is against the influence of Soros but at the same time he welcomes russian and chinese influence
I mean dude, wtf
But to be honest I can understand why some hungarians are still mad at the decisions from 1920, it was simply unfair (in my opinion) that hungary lost 2/3 of its territory
1/3 would have been enough
(I mean it were the habsburgers who wanted the war)
EDIT: But at the same time Im convinced that europeans should stop arguing over god damn borders
Jesus we are all that small, nobody in europe should care about borders anymore
2 days of paid leave when you move to a new home
Not exactly the same thing, but my husband will sometimes say things like “I’ll cut the grass until Thursday”. Like, steady on, I don’t expect you to do it with nail scissors :)
That took a turn
I kind of did already
I lived in Germany for 5 years
I love the people, their food and beer culture and even their annoying administrative ways
Since I do not mind the cold and short dark days, Sweden or Norway might be cool to try and live in
If I wanted a sunnier option, I'd either go to the South of France or Portugal
Those are my picks
There are places where public transport doesn’t really take you places even if it theoretically exists
And non-dangerous drivers would be happy to sit comfortably in a bus, read or play on the phone instead of doing the work of driving themselves and paying for parking
Ecology would win
Kind of cute haha
How did Belgium not have 40° last year and 28-35° this year
Have lived on about 57N latitude, around Xmas and Midsummer we had roughly 4 h of light/dark and 20 h opposite
In winter it feels like there is no day at all: you wake up in dark, go to work in dark, then there is a flick of foggy day in the office window, and then it's dark again, every day feels like overtime because of how long after dark you get off work
Yes, all kinds of light decorations help, Xmas lights, light festivals, alarm with light, whatever
But it's depressing
A bit better when there's actually white (reflective
) snow on the ground, worse in November with all the wet snow/ice rain and wind
On the other hand summers are perfect, lots of light, long days, all green, nice and cosy
But you have to be used to the amount of light too
Foreigners from more southern parts were complaining they can't sleep when the bright sun shines in their bedroom shortly after midnight
Was quite an urgency to find blackout curtains
And water in the sea very rarely is warmer than +17\*C, a bit warmer in lakes and rivers but I would say +20 is the highest you normally find
Fun fact: migratory birds come all the way from Africa or South of Europe because of the long days, then they can feed the chicks almost non-stop
Here in Luxembourg its more like this:
- "Ah yes this guys once said hello and this woman once gave me a pencil, so lets give both of them a vote"
We have up to 23 votes which we can distribute however we want
Luxembourg is small af, so everyone knows everyone
We dont really have a populist party so its fine
EDIT: I mean you can meet the foreign minister in the sauna nearly every weekend lol
I'm young and yet only voted twice
We have eight parties I'd consider important enough to may get involved in the formation of our government so there is already some representation of different ideas
I voted less informed then I wanted, not reading through the manifestos but voted for parties that promote policies I believe in
There is no truly dominant party left in Luxembourg so I felt pretty free to vote for whoever I wanted not needing to consider majorities afterwards
Summing up I wasn't forced to vote for a lesser evil
600k people are living here but only 300k can vote because there are 50% immigrants
During the day there are often nearly 1 million in the country because there are so many frontier workers
‘Oh, isn’t that a city in Belgium/Germany/France/the Netherlands
Also calling Lëtzebuergesch a dialect will piss lots of people off
I would probably go Italian for the main course, but the French have you beat for dessert/cheese course I’m afraid
> To be fair, Luxembourg is a microstate
Don't get me started
For 40 years lived 200 m from a quite lonely beach that would look inviting if you were into nudism
Never saw a single topless/nudist woman
Nowadays people tend to wear something with sleeves to cover from the sun
His French sounds really good
I know French people who are worse at it and I certainly am worse myself
I think that would be Buergbrennen
This is ofteb translated to "castle burning", but in this case "Buerg" doesn't mean "Castle", but comes from the Latin 'burere', "to burn". So a more accurate translation would be "Burn Burning", as "Brennen" is luxembourgish for "burning" or "to burn".
On the first Sunday in Lent (the so called "Buergsonndeg", "Burning Sunday" apparently) the local youth organisations and/or the local fire department build a bonfire with a Cross in it's center
These structures can be huge, as high as 15 meters  and more in some places
Than, after sunset, a torchlight procession will walk to the bonfire and it will be lit by those torchlights
Although I'm sure the KKK would be proud of this tradition, it originates as an old celtic tradition to frighten the winter ghosts and to make sure, that they leave in order for spring to come
At the end of the winter we burn Crosses in all over the country
Like this we want to dislodge the winter
Try Picardy or Brittany
In the future everyone will have to mostly work part time anyways
Otherwise there won’t be enough jobs
I strongly believe in it
I loved my trips to Japan, Israel or the US but coming home, seeing the gentle wheat fields and lush forests with small villages literally every kilometre from the plane over France or Poland and just the feeling of being home, even though I just landed in Paris or Frankfurt, is very strong
There is definetely a european identity
Every european who has already visited a non european country which isnt our neighbour or called USA, knows this
We share so much history, an our history is very connected
We tend to believe that our cultures are so damn different and yes there are some major differences, especially if you compare a northern country like Sweden with a southern country like greece, but at the end of the day they are still pretty similar
You can make rough difference between northern, southern and western, eastern european culture, but then again for non european people those differences are pretty similar
Lets take China for example, a country which is bigger than the european continent and it has a larger population
There are many different cultures in china, maybe as much or even more as in Europe, they also have different languages
Nevertheless nobody would argue that there isnt a chinese identity
Its pretty much the same for europe, well we arent a country, but we are all very homogeneous
True
I feel Luxembourgish but I am also European
I will always be a little happier to meet other European people cause I feel connected to them in some way
Idk why
Oh hi fellow Luxembourger
I think for us Luxembourgish people it's also much easier to feel European because we already have a big diversity in our own country and we're never far from other European nations
I was, why are you asking
I don't think we have one
Hm some say Beligum, Switzerland, also Island or Irland but most do it as gags
Surdus absurdus
And dinja in Russian is a melon
Exotic fruit and food, like melons, coffee, tea, chocolate, even cucumbers came to new areas together with their old names
Some came to different areas from different starting places, like tea in some languages is called chai depending where from it was first imported
I dont like to live here
The country is growing too fast and we have big real estate bubble that will burst in the future
Housing has become so expensive that a normal person wont be able to buy something in the future
Luxembourg has become the country of the rich
Period
And the governement dont care at all
So yeah whatever man
Yes there are many advantages to live here, but I simply dont care anymore
Furthermore I wont be able to get a job because my french is too bad
I will move to germany, thats more than sure
Actually, I already live there because Im studying there
My experience: People in germany are much more friendly (well most of them) and its simply better to live there
I also like belgium, but then I have the problem of my bad french again
Austria is also pretty nice
I still live in Luxembourg, but Im studying in Germany and I also have a small Appartement there
I will leave Luxembourg as soon as Im finished
Housing has become unaffordable and my french is too bad to get a job
Because of some decisions in the last few years french has become more important than ever before (eventhough luxembourgish is the national language and german is an official language aswell)
And as I said my french is simply not good enough and its considered racist/nationalist to say people should speak luxembourgish
(eventough it should be obligated in hospitals etc, but thats just my opinion)
So I decided to try my luck in Germany, Austria, Italy or Belgium
And how do you say "cake" in Swedish
God that sounds like my hell
God that sounds like my hell
An hour
I can visit 4 countries in a single day just by accident: Luxembourg, Belgium, France, Germany
Counted, I've been to 20 European countries, including traditionally religious ones, and no, never seen anything close to that
Walked a pilgrimage and still no
In Luxembourg we have 2 flags, the official one that looks like the dutch one, we almost never use
The second one with a red lion is the one to go with
If there is only one Luxembourger that participates in a sporting event abroad like the tour the france, everybody uses the flag to give him credits and out of proud that finally one guy made it
We still make jokes about it but its too much in the past so nobody cares
But naming the province after our country and also taking exactly the same flag was really a big fuck you to us hahaha
I feel like Germany is the country where the wars that happened, are still the most obvious and unforgettable
Which is kinda
understandable, because your (edit: great-)grandparents started the last war haha
But it is impressive how hard your ancestors did work in the end, to make sure you won't forget about it
Germany is the only country where I feel like WW2 plays sich a HUGE role
Why do people always take everything so literal  isn't it obvious that I am not talking about 12 years old
Like who blames children
My grandparents were children too
One side of my grabdparents are Italians
Does that mean they were Nazis or followers of Mussolini
Which is logical, cause they were children
No idea what their parents did though, I only know that they were starving during WW2
And I'm claiming most of us would do horrible things if someone threatened to kill us or our family
(I hope y'all don't get me wrong, I love Germany
I am not trying to blame anyone here lol)
Yeah never said it's a bad thing haha
I just meant that it is the only country where WW2 still feels kinda present and not like history
No matter which city I visited, there are always many stories about it
Berlin being the most historical of them all
Well I don't feel like "your country" makes it any more inclusive cause it is still your grandparents
Plus it still sounds like the whole country was at fault
And how does it make people feel any better who suffered under Nazi Germany to be included
I am not talking about German Jewish people, or German anti-nazi protestors (Sophie Scholl etc) when I am talking about the people who started the war
I think that's kinda obvious, no
Well all I am saying is, that to me I know that there are German people whose grandparents never were Nazis and I don't want them to feel adressed by this post
Definitely but that's why I'm saying that Germany seems to be the country that was affected the most by past wars until today
:) That's why it is impressive, that their ancestors made sure they won't forget instead of being like other countries who downplay it all
Well you are right there
Especially US Americans get generalized a lot
Yeah I don't agree with some parts but that's fine
Well problem is that is great-grandparents AND grandparents
The other person is right
I am 23 and mine were around 10+ when the war ended
so your grandparents were just incredibly young
But if it eases your mind I'll add "great" in the original comment
3000 ri should be roughly around 1700km (since it is based on the chinese li, I assume that at least the ri mentioned in the anthem should still based on the Chinese instead of the Japanese measurement)
The London Underground might be first, but the Moscow metro kicks its arse aesthetically
Same here, I think "Mail" is even more commonly used than "e-Mail".
I think it would not be  genuine to leave out the HRE
It’s clearly a German proto state on what is today mostly German speaking territory
The idea of a German nation may be new but the cultural connection that all the small kingdoms/ dukedoms shared were still present
It’s true that modern nations like Italy or Czechia were part of it but the core was always mostly German imo
I know he’s a horrible paedo, but leaving his eyes unblurred like that is nightmare fuel
>Like for example, France and Belgium are very close as we share the same language, a patrimony somewhat related, etc
Yo France dont steal our brother
*This was written by the Bel-Lux Brotherhood*
>and Luxembourg is too rich and couldn't be bothered by outside problems
You [sure] I mean nearly 20% poverty rate is not really
Rich
Oh and did mention that [working poor is only in romania a bigger problem
And because Im in the mood, we have the [3rd highest youth unemployment rate, after spain and greece]
Ahh yes god damn this rich Luxembourg
EDIT: Im not mad, its just funny that everybody always thinks that we are rich eventough the reality is much more complex
I just tought our dutch brother would know this :(
I mean, I wouldnt even have a problem with that
A federalist Benelux country in swiss style would be a great idea in my opinion
In such a state we would immediately be one of the most important countries in europe and at the same time the interests of the minorities (like luxembourgers) would still be protected because of the (swiss) federalism
Didnt Luxembourg say we would rejoin when you guys would have a king again
And btw, Luxembourg wasnt part of the netherlands itself, it was owned by your king because he wanted to call himself "grand-duc".
Even if you earn 5k in Luxembourg, you dont live "damn well". In fact you wont even be able to buy a house
Maybe a 30m2 Appartement for 300k on the landside
But only if the bank gives you the credit, because you need to have 30% of those 300k. But guess what its nearly impossible to get these 30% because the rents are also too high
Nowadays 75% of the land is owned by 3% of the people
When you are poor in Luxembourg it means that you wont be able to rent an Appartement
So either you are lucky and get one of those social Appartements or you will end on the streets
If you have a nice family who has enough rooms to take you, good for you, if not
Well leave the country just as the 35k luxembourgers who already did this
(did I mention that only 320k luxembourgers "exist" in total
Being poor is just as bad here as it is in every other european country
Maybe not as bad as in tunisia for example, but why should we compare rich european nations to developing countries
The salaries are high, but they are often not high enough
You will need to earn at least 7k to have a decent life here, but only on the landside then
And honestly its simply not worth it
If you inherit some real estate you have won the jackpot, because then you are a millionaire
But otherwise
You can live on the border, then its totally worth to work in Luxembourg, but a lot of people are doing this and being stuck in a traffic jam for 4 hours a day is simply not worth it in my opinion
I will leave luxembourg because Im too poor to live here
I wont inherit anything and I wont be able to buy anything
I ll move to belgium, germany or northern italy Im not sure yet
But I think its going to be germany
The country has been sold to some rich dudes who buy our Appartements because they know its a good investement
(and then they stay empty because it would be to hard to get rid of the renter)
Its going to be fun as soon as the bubble bursts
EDIT: sorry for the long text, but its just really depressing to talk about this
I know but those statistics are a bit incorrect
50% of the people who work here are cross border workers
(nearly 300k)
The high GDP per capita is partly due to the country's large share of cross-border workers in total employment
While contributing to GDP, these workers are not taken into consideration as part of the resident population which is used to calculate GDP per capita
Thats why our gdp per capita is a lot too high
(its in german sorry)
But yeah our salaries are still high, but as I said they are not high enough
No no hes got a point
Luxembourg is the only country which was part of the HRE and the german bund but never joined the german reich
The prussians were actually pretty pissed, because our militarys used to work togehter and they built our industry
After we said "no" to them, they called us a parasite and wanted to annex us
But GB and France guaranteed our independence
In 1914 they occupied us and wanted to annex us in case they would win
Our grand duchesse drank tea with the kaiser, thats why she was removed from the throne after the war
In WW2 hitler tried it again, he considered us as germans and called it "Heim ins Reich". (Back home into the reich)
He prohibited our language and forced our boys into the wehrmacht
They had to fought on the eastern front and lot of them ran over in order to fight with the soviets
Other fled immediately with their families in order to fight with the british forces
Hitler nearly recuited 5% of our population and the ones who didnt want to serve were shot and their families deported
(their familied were also deported after they ran over to the soviet side)
Hitler also wanted to deport nearly 20% of our population because they werent german enough
After the war, the german collaborators were shot, Gaulleiter Gustav Simon was "stolen" from us imprisonment and then beaten to death by luxembourgish forces in Luxembourg
The other german collaborators had needed to leave their house and were deported into germany
And we had a reform of our language, everything that seemed too german was banned
Actually our national motto is "Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn, mir wëllen jo keng preisen gin"
Which means: We want to stay what we are and dont want to become prussians
Nowadays germany is considered as our closest ally, and germany is loved by most luxembourgers (during the world cups, luxembourgers usually support germany for example)
Replace ours with the red lion
Our flag looks dutch
Thanks to Belgium and the Netherlands for being awesome Partners
Benelux united
Thank you Switzerland for being such a pretty country
Djonn méid his wéi tu e tewwërn sru se dark forrëst, ounli tu faind aut sett hi forgott se manni
Portuguese: Jon maid his uai tu a távern tru de darque forest, ónli to find aute hi forgót his moni
Since I know English, this might be a bit wrong, but eh
Džon meid his vei tu e tavern trū ze dark forest onlī tu faind aut zat hī forgot ze manī.
(Latvian)
Den John mescht sein wee zu enger traverne duerch den Dark Forest, nemme fier rauszefannen dad hien säi Geld vergiess hued
I mean we had the gibraltar of the north but it sadly got dismantled because french people are a bunch of pussys
Don't you like beer
Our natural landscape, our castles, our little villages and our capital city are all beautiful, we make amazing beer and wine, we have a Grand Duke, everyone speaks at least 4 languages, the food is great and public transport is free
Just saying
Hal de Bak du Schäissfranzous
En français svp
Sure but Belgian beer is still more interesting as a whole
See Trappists and lambics for example
J'avoue, je suis français
It's not about giving an European feeling nor is it a tourist trap
It's just people opening restaurant serving food from their origin country
The rest of the world doesn‘t know a lot about us
There‘s people in Germany, which is right next to us, that don‘t know that we have our own language
While most people in the world know at least the stereotypes about Germany, like they wear Lederhosen, drink a lot of beer, especially when it‘s Oktoberfest etc
I think the only thing people really know about us is „Banks“. But f.ex
the fact that we have, just like Germany, our own little annual fair, the Schueberfouer, is something people don‘t know about
Smaller countries are just ignored a lot
When you're abroad or on holiday and you meet someone from your country, this person is instantly your best friend
Also, the probability is very high that you have common friends
**News**
It’s a mixture of national and local news
If you take a look at the Luxembourgish newspaper for example, you get national and international news just like your usual newspaper from a bigger country
Turn a few pages and you get to see short articles about elder ladies donating 700€ for a charity, about a car accident near village X and how the commune of Y got a new firetruck
**Traveling**
Before the Euro became a thing, it was completely normal to have German Mark or French Franc at home, just in case you’d like to go on a shopping trip over the border during the weekend
And before there was the Schengen agreement, make sure you brought along a small present for the border check like a few bottles of beer, so they let you through faster
**Politics**
Changes in politics can happen very fast or very slowly
We had Jean-Claude Juncker as our Prime Minister for over 18 years and his party was at the top for multiple decades in a row
But at some point he made an oopsie, we held a referendum and formed a new parliament, all in the same year
In Luxembourg its totally normal to watch the news and tv channels in general from other countries
(especially germany and france)
We have our own tv channels but still, its a luxembourgish thing
Its also normal to speal up to 4 languages every day
And its normal that we cross the borders at least once a week
Same for our neighbours btw
Hm well first there is the 'mess' or bless with the languages
We can speak so many different languages but the sad thing is also that many foreigners don't learn the local language because 'no one uses it or everyone already know their language so why bother'. Furthermore everything is closer, you don't need to take a 'daytrip' only to get something or to get somewhere
It is really convenient
And lastly well we can always joke about getting some pieces of lands back without everyone going crazy and call you a nazi or some sort, people take the joke as a joke
You don't get the essence of a "true" small country
SEE
How
You are right next to us
1) Makes sense but still
2)I guess I should be happy that we don‘t have some very annoying, incompetent and racist person as president
3) That might have to do something with the fact that there‘s not a lot of Luxembourgish media
I can only name rather ridiculous songs, not anything serious, the only movies that I know of are for children, or„Superjemp“, or Sawah (it plays for the most part in Luxembourg and there is some Luxembourgish in it, it‘s actually on Netflix)
But the thing is, you wouldn‘t watch or listen to it anyways, because Luxembourgish media is normally in Luxembourgish and, while we speak both German and French, the countries around us, don‘t speak our language, so you would have to watch it with subtitles and I feel like no one would do that because the stuff we have actually isn‘t that good, because why would we make movies in a language that no one understands
In Portuguese donkey means "burro". But it also means "stupid", literally
Luxembourgish features the delightful term of the Pimpampel meaning butterfly
I speak four languages and I can confidently say that Pimpampel is simply the best name for those wonderful insects
I don’t really like it (reminds me of pimple), but keisecker and kaweechelchen are awesome words
In Luxembourgish too :)
Never forget the Getëppelt Meppel
You’ve stumped me with that one, I’m afraid (and more importantly, my native Luxembourgish husband too)
A dotted
Fire salamanders are called Getëppelte Meppel
Most of them went abroad but for example science fiction was invented by a Luxembourgish guy who migrated to the states, or first colour photos but that lad went to France
The only dude who stayed in Luxembourg and did something great would maybe be Henri Tudor who created the first commercial lead-acid battery (the first lead-acid battery however was created by a French man tho)
In Luxembourg we call them "Giëlemännecher", yellow men, it's also the name of a bird, the yellowhammer
The name comes from the yellow uniforms the members of the fascist party in Luxembourg wore
Well we are so small that there are almost no to none, the only indie game I know is Sigi - a fart for Melusina and it is not famous too so
Thanks Germany for the cheap groceries
Thanks France for the cheap labours
Thanks Belgium for being our bigger brother
Even though France and Germany played ping pong with us and Belgium tried to eat us whole up when they gained independence, at the end it all helped us out in a way :)
We got a local producer called Rosport also making a soda apple juice called Rosport Pom's
Sumol is portuguese
That explains why we have it too in Luxembourg haha
Hey it is also buy able in Luxembourg haha
Oh I absolutely love Rivella, drank a lot back then in middle school
Really depends on the jokes
I do sometimes joke with my German friends about WW2 but I wouldn't do it if you don't know the rules
like if you haven't been around Germans a lot, it's bettee to not make jokes
Tho jokes about nazis and how stupid they are, are always welcome
I like to play in German
As a kid I always played games like Pokemon in German and to this day I refuse to play Pokemon in any other language because I love the German Pokemon names
Also I prefer German over English so it's not a difficult choice
French tho
dunno
Not a thing in Luxembourg
They would only be possible on the plateaus in the North as the rest of the country gets way less snow and even there they wouldn't hold more then a day max
Not anywhere close to what happened in Beirut, but since you asked: [the Bommeleeër affair ]
It technically happened in Belgium but it was right on the border - the [Martelange disaster] A truck carrying 47,000L of fuel missed a turn, crashed into a bridge and exploded, killing 22, injuring 47 and starting dozens of fires
My Italian colleague told me she was there when the Bologna bombing happened, sounded terrifying (obviously enough)
I just looked it up and it was the 40th anniversary the other day
Honestly, I had never heard of it before she told me
Crazy to see they’re still investigating it
I love Bologna, by the way
Seems like it would be a great place to live
LOVE IT
Growing up, my family of 5 drank at least 3 liters a day
that’s because they milk the bulls too
That's it
The place where a huge meteorite fell over 100 years ago
It is right in the middle of nowhere and only known for the meteorite
Having a weird-ass language
(Well, dialect if you wanna be more precise
) The Dutch get all the credit, though
Luxembourgish is one of the wierdest languages I know
It has grammatical rules, but I, for one, cannot comprehend them and the pronounciation varies from French-sounding to almost Dutch
P.S for the OP:
Que região é que come caracóis
Nunca ouvi falar disso
Oof
I completely forgot about Welsh, sorry about that
No Norte, acho que não é. Pelo menos, eu nunca comi nem vi nos restaurantes
Pois
No Norte é mais frango e leitão.
We got older cities with a certain architecture to them
In most city centers construction rules forbid to erect skyscrapers
I know London has that wierd law where you can't block the view on Saint Paul Cathedral
European urbanism is different and skyscrapers are no part of it
Well here in  Luxemburg we call ball pens "Bic"
Razors are most offtenly reffered to as "Gilette"
And we call most offroad vehicles Jeep
Yes, kite and dragon mean “Draach“ in luxemburgish
The literal translation of kite from French into English would be *flying deer* but as far as I remember the etymology is the same (dragon) but the spelling somehow changed and turned it into a deer instead
Edit: it's the same word for both in Luxembourgish
This, but with fellow countrymen
Maybe she was asking you where the restroom was
All the time
Look at the dimensions of Luxembourg
There also are no border checks at all inside the EU
There are people coming to Luxembourg everyday from the surrounding countries to work here and vice versa
Also, small correction, it's not exclusive to the EU, or true fir every member, it's sbout the so called Schengen Agreement
Schengen btw is a town in Luxembourg on the German French tri-border area
Personally, before CoViD 19 began, I went home every second weekend, crossing two borders to do so
Within EU you don't have to be a citizen of that country where you live or work
You can be citizen of A, live in B, cross over for work to C, go shopping to D, on holiday to E and so on
And to tease Americans it's all covered by free healthcare
Before lockdowns were a thing weekly grocery shopping trip either to Germany or France
Belgium is less interesting but they got the closest Ikea
Now we are a bit confused as we can't get to the usual shops, at least not that easy
Or just for a dog walk
Depends on the mood
A little further but still easy reachable are the Netherlands and Switzerland, maybe not a day trip but ok for a weekend
Only need ID the same as locally, you have to have some ID always
And for dogs EU dog passport with marks of vaccinations
Mind that most countries are small and some are very tiny, you make 1 wrong turn on the autobahn and you are out of your country
Edit: and about 200 000 people come in for work daily
In a country with 600 000 residents
And Grand Region around Luxembourg with parts of neighbouring countries
And now there are no phone roaming fees in EU, you pay for the calls from/to another country the same as normally at home
But school trips need lots of planning, you can't just take a bunch of underage kids and drop them off in the middle of an empty field for a few weeks
It has to be interesting, dynamic, educational, within reasonable price, safe, comfortable enough
Schools know their trip locations and rarely change them
On mobile phone
Because for me it's literally the same as after the roaming fees were cancelled there is no aditional cost for any calls be it from home country to abroad, abroad - home, abroad - abroad different combinations of countries, all are covered by subscription, I don't have to watch how long I talk to my family and from where
The same as mobile internet
Maybe because that list is for business
Or maybe you have to rise a big stink about it
My plan for when I retire
Saving for a motorhome now and then go, stop whenever there's something interesting, explore, go again
Some country borders have been pulled this way and that way like a too narrow blanket, people living in border areas just wake up in a different country one morning
It reflects on the language
I mean if they can't even stop on pedestrian walks, they will certainly drive around the Arc de Triomphe at high speed
I haven't been in Paris but I've had several experiences with French drivers
French if we exclude all the French people who come here for work but don't live here or it would be Luxembourgish
It will be totally legalized soon here
So yeah seems like even the governement is a fan of it
But yes most young people are smoking it
But oh boi it will be fun for our neighbours as soon as we legalize it
Yes
Im high
Level is very good, very rarely do I see any mistakes
I am currently abroad to go to university, but I'll probably go back home after I graduated, unless there's a good job offering I could get
There wasn't a real university in Luxembourg until the early 2000s, so it is still the norm for students to go abroad, mostly in Germany, Belgium and France, but there are a lot of students from Luxembourg all around Europe
Yes
Moved from Portugal to Luxembourg when I was 11 (I’m 24 now)
And couldn’t be more grateful
Thanks to that move,
I now speak 6 languages, I’m doing a masters degree and live in a great tiny country and can see quite a good future for myself
I sometimes wonder what my life would have been if I had stayed in my little rural village somewhere in the Portuguese mountains
It's "iron lane" not iron road in Luxembourgish(Eisenbunn), but that's but a small technicality
In German(Eisenbahn), it's also iron lane, in French(chemin de fer), it's iron path
Yep, nonsense text and some random year number
Lately I've even seen geographical coordinates
I looked one up and it was some point in the North Sea east of Scotland
Maybe an offshore oil drilling platform
Or just completely random
The only Lithuanian I know is like a big, goofy puppy who loves basketball
I would have guessed more like Estonians or Finns
Although I know a Latvian girl also who is the most cheerful person on the planet, so maybe it’s all dumb stereotypes
Belgians are the dumbest people alive
I'm really interested in European politics but happen to know most about German politics followed by British
I lack a real understanding of French politics and have little idea what happens in Spain except fir separatist movements
Once something gets internationally relevant like Poland's and Hungary's efforts to abolish democracy I will have heard of it
What I lack in knowledge in national politics I make up for with my understanding of the politics of the European Union mostly
It's fascinating
Seeing how long a country can go without government is so interesting
Those wierd seperatist movements are similarly interesting
They spent nearly two years to form a government coalition
They had no formal government
People working in the ministries will still do there jobs and live continues but no one is in governing the country
When I was a librarian, my watch always went wrong from using the magnet machines
Also, the library was in an old psychiatric asylum, so I suppose that was spooky too
Peasant and herbal medicine healer as in the family
Without the modern medicine and cosmetics I would be a horrible looking witch with crooked and missing teeth, wart on the face, gray hair, limping badly and have a hunch
That is if I somehow managed to survive all the incidents and illnesses our medicine of today so far has pulled me out of
Infusions can only do so much
Probably death or a maid/slave of the Preussen man (before Germany got founded) Luxembourg got taken by the Preussen so yeahhh not very cool
What kind of logic is that
The communists won the civil war and have control over the main land
They are the legitimate government of mainland China
Edit: I'm obviously not in favor of the CCP and would personally like to see a regime change
We're in the same boat
International companies can never decide if we're a German or French speaking country (I don't even expect for them to support Luxembourgish)
Some titles on Netflix are not available in their original English but only in German or French
A lot of websites automatically only allow a german or french
The Amazon website doesn't differentiate between interface and content language
I want it to be in English but then it also often automatically translates french and german product descriptions to English what I don't want
If I change the settings to German, it translates english descriptions to German what I also don't want
I was surprised when I travelled to Spain and no one wanted to share
In my opinion France should lead the way in the EU
France  has always preserved the european culture and wasnt afraid to say no to the US
... But then again there is germany who keeps sucking the balls of the US, Russia and turkey
They also have the strongest military in europe in general
They are highly trained, they have their own military industry and they have one of the highest Budgets here
Some say that turkey have a stronger army, but their equipment isnt as modern as the french one and their soldiers arent as trained
They only problem France has is that their economy has stagnated the last 2 decades
They need reforms but yeah nobody has the political power to do it
Is the book "For Whom the Bell Tolls"?
So I don't know much about African or South American history, but I'm not ashamed of that
I feel like I should probably know more than I do about the American War of Independence

The Müllertal, Luxembourg's little Switzerland
Our Country is ideal for tourists in most places but the Müllertal is a little above the competition

Most would know that a state or a bigger city is in America but also would not know which city is in which state, except the most famous ones, and some even don't know which is a state and which is a city

Yes
Open borders, single currency, no customs inside, different countries, different climate, rich history
Happy 25 years
It's compulsory in Luxembourg
I am quite surprised that it is that rare
Those numbers mean that even Luxembourgish is more frequently spoken
It mainly surprises me because Ireland still is much larger then Luxembourg
Considering both, its size and its population
I can understand the different circumstances but still would have guessed wildly different numbers
This is beautiful
In Luxembourg it is the norm to drink tap water but we have quite old piping do we drink bottled water
Wroclaw is the first I haven't heard of
I've heard of most of them however with a poignant lack of Polish and Romanian cities or Eastern Europe more broadly, however reading the comments here I know some by older names (Szczecin and Brno)
The only city I hadn't heard of outside of Eastern Europe was Murcia in Spain
Just know atleast a bit of German and French then you're good
Learn french and german first
Super helpful advice, thank you

The border between Luxembourg and Germany is mostly* defined as the Moselle, Sauer (or Sûre if you will) and Our rivers
The fun part: it's not a line through the rivers or along the rivers, but the rivers themselves
So the whole shape, that's created by the river is a condominium (under the sovereignty of both countries)
*mostly, because there's one small part near the City of Vianden where the border circles around the castle instead of following the river in order for the castle to be part of Luxembourg
Hi from New Zealand: fun fact, we call them kiwifruit and reserve the word kiwi for birds and people

What do you call the supermarket (or is that just in Norway)
Clearly I need to visit Sweden to expand my knowledge of regional supermarkets
Darn, no reason to visit Sweden now
We do have some here and there but most are just ruins and barely any left
One of the reconstructed and really beautiful view on the landscape is [the roman funeral at Bech Kleinmacher] Further north there is a [villa] near the oldest Town of the country but onky ruins are left
Then there was also [a small city]  (arguably the most important and impressive remains in the city)
Not too much is still known, everything is in ruin and there are still remainings not yet found
The best preserved is a [mosaic] found in Vichten (where a replica is there nowadays)
One can see it while visiting the National Museum of History and Art in Luxembourg City
There one can also see some smaller stuff found in Luxembourg (coins for example)

Usually I never rewatch a show or movie
This happens on a daily basis here
We have a lot of people working here that don't speak Luxembourgish, so most people just start a conversation in French and the other reply in French just to find out after some time that both actually speak Luxembourgish

I can't answer you first question about university prices in Luxembourg cause I'm studying in Belgium, but rent is quite high here
There's probably student housings for much cheaper though, if you're applying early enough to get one
What I can say though, is that their aim for the University of Luxembourg is for it to become an international university as opposed to one attracting Luxembourgers, so studying in English shouldn't be a problem
Alcohol, cigarettes, gas, coffee
but thats it
Fuel, because fuel taxes are low in Luxembourg
Alcohol, Tobacco, gasoline, taxes
Luxembourg:
Diesel for under an Euro the liter,
The 95 Gazoline is 1,01 € the liter
It’s awesome awesome and the price will fall even more
Heavy alcohol and cigarettes
In Luxembourg, it's an official holiday
Other EU members are supposed to follow
Not really, at least far less than the national flag on Grand-Duke's day, but at least it's been a national holiday over here for a few years now
When they introduced it here, the government said that apparently every member state is supposed to have that holiday in the future but for now it seems as we're the only ones who have it

Hello, small, way too expensive European neighbour  though I envy you for your Icelandic translated Disney movies, I wish we had those in Luxembourgish
In that case, thanks for educating my to know better
Yes, but regarding the context of the discussion here, the entry difficulties are a valid point to be brought up
To work somewhere, you ideally have a residence there first, making the living cost a real entry blockade
Finding a suitable workplace isn't always evident even ignoring that
Higher living costs will also always be a burden on poor people and never is all poverty self-inflicted

The language is a sensitive topic here
There are actually luxembourgers who will get very angry when you tell them that luxembourgish is similar to german
Its because of our history with germany/prussia
Since the creation of the german reich they tried to annex us and called us parasites
Then in WW2 Hitler tried to convince us that we are germans, luxembourgish was forbidden and we had to speak german
Everywhere were posters which said: "Luxembourger you are german and your language is german"
Well this backfired of course, so Hitler decided that he has to deport everyone who isnt german enough
(the plan was to deport 40% of our population, at the end only 7% were deported because of the ongoing war)
The deported ones were replaced with germans from the balkans and Alsace
Luxembourgish became the most important part of our identity back then
Furthermore Luxembourgers were forced to fight with the germans on the east front, a lot of them tried to change sites there, but sadly the soviets often shot them before they reached them
At the same time Luxembourgers were used as cannon fodder because the germans looked down on us
(eventough they said we were germans)
Those boys were told every day that they are germans and that they have to fight for the führer eventough they hated the nazis as much as the soviets
So yeah after the war there was a widespread racism towards germans and collaborators were often lynched at night
There was also a reform to ban everything from our orthography that looked too german
And people started to use french words for words that sounded too german
Our national motto is: We want to stay what we are
It used to be: We want to stay what we are and we dont become prussians/germans
(because we still call germans prussians but nowadays without hard feelings)
So yeah its still a sensitive topic nowadays, some people still get very angry when you tell them luxembourgish is similar to german
(especially the older generation)
I don't understand Dutch, Flemish, Frisian and Afrikaans at all
Maybe a word here and there but mostly not
Low German is somewhat understandable but still have to put my whole concentration on it
Fun fact: when I was in the Netherlands and talked with my friends in Luxembourgish people thought we were natives and talked with us in Dutch which was weird and confusing
But they didn't understand us
Luxembourgers have to actually learn German, it doesn't come automatically although it's easier than some other languages
Luxembourgish is much softer sounding than German
For foreigners who are learning Luxembourgish knowing German or Dutch does help a little but they are different enough that you need to learn, can't just sail through
Mir kënnen et jo mol austesten, villäicht verstees de mech am Enn awer nach
Wee weess alles ass méiglech haha
Well its worth mentioning that most germans actually never learn luxembourgish because they have a lot of problems in pronouncing our language
They usually start speaking a whole new language which is weird mix of luxembourgish and german
I mean you can understand them and they understand luxembourgish but it just sounds weird
Eventough I speak both languages I cant speak their version of luxembourgish/german
Nope it wouldnt
People really just got a problem when people say its like german or its just a german accent
And this is because of our history
And I also wanted to state that nowadays our hard feelings towards germans are gone
We even have a huge cemetery for their fallen soldiers in WW2
The cemetery is even bigger than the american one
(and the american one has the grave of General Patton)
But yeah its mainly because the nazis wanted to destroy our identity, and the language was something like our last resort to clearly show the world that we are not germans
It is quite similar to german but following a conversation will take a lot of practice if you only know standard german
Maybe as intelligible to germans as swiss german
Lots of french words in there too which makes it a bit tricky
Gramatically it is also very similar to german (it loses the genitiv declination like many dialects do too)
I'm not from there but I do have lots of friends from there
The language there is German but in the southern part (St Vith) they have a dialect that's pretty close to Luxembourgish so you could have a conversation between a Luxembourger speaking Luxembourgish and a Belgian speaking that dialect with both understanding each other
People from around Eupen (northern part of the region) usually don't understand Luxembourgish though
Ops, ops, ops, there is no German speaking part of Belgium
The Wallonian part of Belgium speaks French and the Flemish part - Dutch
Luxembourgish is spoken in Luxembourg only
Even if the part of Belgium nearest to Luxembourg really is called Luxembourg too they still speak French there
Yes almost, I said:
We can test it, maybe at the end you do understand me
Who knows everything is possible haha
Wasn't that hard I guess :D
Edit: forgot the haha at the end
Its has its origines from a dialect
But I know some people who are not able to speak german, like my father for example
And most luxembourgers have a weird accent when they speak german
(like Junckers accent)
.. But yeah the language is a very sensitive topic here and nobody will ever call it a dialect and when you they will probably get very angry and call you a nazi
Im made another comment on the reason why, here is the text:
>The language is a sensitive topic here
>There are actually luxembourgers who will get very angry when you tell them that luxembourgish is similar to german
>Its because of our history with germany/prussia

>Then in WW2 Hitler tried to convince us that we are germans, luxembourgish was forbidden and we had to speak german

Gustav Simon the former Gaulleiter was kidnapped from american detention and then beaten to death here in Luxembourg, because people from the resistance and the governement didnt want to see him in front of a trial
>There was also a reform to ban everything from our orthography that looked too german

>Our national motto is: We want to stay what we are

>So yeah its still a sensitive topic nowadays, some people still get very angry when you tell them luxembourgish is similar to german or even a dialect
(especially the older generation)
I know you are german, so no worries nowadays the hard feelings are gone, we even have a bigger cemetery for the german soldiers here than for the american soldiers
If you want to know more about this topic you can watch the "Heim ins Reich" documentary on youtube
Yeah that really helps and it sounds similar too
Enn is Ende for example
I understood what you meant and its possible to talk about this with some people nowadays but always choose your words wisely
My opinion is that Luxembourgish nowaydays is a proper language
It has its own grammar and orthographie which is in fact very different to the german one
But this doesnt mean that its very close to german
Its still a relatively new language and at the start of the last century it was 100% a dialect
But even today its very close to moselfränkisch
Oh I didn't know that haha, in Luxembourgish it is an
Quite like it actually
Never heard of anyone here who hates our capital
The biggest complaints are always about the insane amount of construction sites and they are right >.>
Yeah we like it
Mmmh im from the east and people from L City are often portrayed as snobbish pricks and feel themselves better by using excessive french slang in their language
I agree its worse in DE for example
I think Luxembourg is somewhat unique in that aspect
We have 3 official languages: Luxembourgish, French and German
People who have gone through the Luxembourgish education system will know and will be able to speak these 3 languages
Apart from these 3 languages we also learn English at school
You get taught German in 1st grade, you start with French in 2nd grade and English in 8th grade
Luxembourgish is usually on the school schedule from 1st grade just until 7-8th grade
In primary school you usually just read stories in Luxembourgish and in 7th grade I was thought some grammar as well, but not too much
Note that even though we aren't taught Luxembourgish as thouroughly as German, French and English, it's the language in which I and most people in Luxembourg talk to each other in the everyday life
School subjects are often taught verbally in Luxembourgish, but are written and read either in French or German
Example: In biology class, my teacher taught and explained everything in Luxembourgish but the sheets she handed out and her PowerPoint were in French and we also had to write tests in French
Apart from all this, you need to know that 47% (2019) of the population are immigrants
The big majority of these 47% are EU-citizens and a lot of them are from Portugal or are of Portuguese descent
I have to mention, that there are "immigrants" who have been living in Luxembourg for decades, may even feel Luxembourgish but just don't have the Luxembourgish citizenship because they don't need to, because we live in the Schengen area
Young people like me, who have been born in Luxembourg to immigrant parents will know 5 languages and this is pretty normal here
A lot of people I know speak 5 languages
My parents though, they know their mother tongue and they know French, no Luxembourgish
This is the case for a lot of immigrants
Since everyone speaks French, by only knowing French you will have no issue at all living and working in Luxembourg for a long time but it will be more difficult for you to integrate into the "native" Luxembourgish society
So yeah, to respond to your last question specifically
You're definitely at a loss if you don't speak Luxembourgish and French well and it's uncommon for the young generation to know less than 4 languages (Luxembourgish, French, German, English)
If you don't know these 4, there will be situations where you won't be able to communicate with the person in front of you
It's expected to be fluent in French, German and often English too
Luxembourgish is considered to be an advantage
Most job offers expect at least 3 of these languages as not optional
Yeah some Luxembourgish people dislike speaking French for whatever reason
There are tours all around the historical heritage of our capital and I prefer thosr to any museum in particular
Most of our Museums are quite standart
Two that stood out to me however were the City museum and the National military history museum in Diekirch
The second one is basically only about the battle of the bulge though
I love it when people try to speak any of my native languages
Maybe the people in Luxembourg were just annoyed because you wanted to talk to them in French haha
Money, iron ore or the smell of fertiliser
With the number of construction sites we currently got here concrete could work as well
Other alternatives include: diesel and tabacco
I'd call coffee the better choice because a pizza smell is a nearly impossible thing unless you define what pizza we are talking about making it to specific
Those are rookie numbers
But is there a Margeritha smell that isn't just Oregano and Basilic
In Luxembourg it will still be about half of a normal man's salary that goes straight into living
Yo what half of the salary
Where the f.. do you live
About 60-70% for normal people is far more correct, maybe not for the fonctionnaires and bank employees but for the rest its more than 50% unless you live somewhere in the north where nobody really wants to live
I'm sorry for me naiv questions
I grew up on pizzas made from Bosnians and Portugueses
Nah, as long as I don't visit Italy I can live with the sin I commit by eating Portuguese pizza
Hm only 5
Well Amsterdam, Colmar, Prague, Athen and Saint Petersburg
In my mind the 0 signals it's a date written
Like you can write 01
21 or 01/02/21 or 01
02 or 01/02 and it's clearly a date but if you just write 1
2 or 1/2 you can mix it with anything
Might be a matter of taste, but I say yes
Ive never had a luxembourgish gf
My first gf was french
The cultural differences werent that big
My ex gf was from croatia and my current gf is from serbia
There aren some differences, but it are minor differences
But Ive learned one thing:
**Never** talk about the 90s. **Simply dont**.
In my family we have half a dozen to a dozen different nationalities, depending how you count
14 languages (some speak 4 or 5 but they also overlap)
Lingua franca is English
Living in 4 countries
And some more where some of us has lived a longer while
I like to have either a place to stay or insiders knowledge about the cities I go to visit
Maybe we have already rubbed of the edges but cultural differences don’t seem too big
The same you could find within one nation just family traditions and personal preferences
2 stories:
Once my ex gf asked me why my grandpa and my whole family was able to forgive the germans
Context: The nazis killed all of my family, only my grandpa survived as a kid and thats also the reason why I dont know where my family actually comes from and what my real family name is
(we dont look like luxembourgers, we have the latino look)
And I replied, that after the war people wanted to move on and that we (Luxembourgers) tried to forgive them
It were the nazis who killed my family not the germans in general
And then she replied that she cant understand this and that she wont ever forget serbians
Then I replied that this is stupid, that hate only leads to hate and that nearly 30 years after the war its time to move on
Oh well she didnt share my opinion
Then my current gf and her family are from kosovo during the war they were forced to leave their house so they fled to serbia
In serbia a bomb from the NATO hit their house where they stayed, afer this they fled to Luxembourg where they became refugees
(and stayed)
Once we were talking about serbia and the eu and I said why isnt serbia just accepting the independence of kosovo, because of the law of nations
(right of self-determination)
After a long discussion she even started to cry and I realised that this topic is simply too complex to be understand by a western european
But I honestly think that I helped both of them because Im strictly against nationalism
Nowadays my gf sees a lot of things with other eyes which is good
a for and, e for anyway
It's a personal thing
My father for example never wants to talk about it while others openly discuss it
Idk dude
The semi presidential modell was established by Duverger to describe the political system of france
However your system is a bit more complicated because as soon you have the cohabitation situation, your president is weak af
(Cohabitation - > the Opposition party has the power in the parliament)
The official languages are Luxembourgish, French and German
Additionally, almost everyone speaks English, except for older generations
>What languages are the schools or the government in
In school, German, French and English are taught in undergrad
Discussions in the parliament are in Luxembourgish, legislation is generally in French, but all government documents are available in Lux, Fr, Ger, Engl and also Portoguese
>How early do they have you start learning the other language(s)
If I remember correctly, we have started to learn German at 6, then French at 7 and English at 12/13
Also, non-language classes such as history, geography, math, etc
were taught in German until highschool and after that in French
Luxembourg here: mostly everyone born and raised in Luxembourg knows at least 3 languages and are more or less fluent with it (luxembourgish, french, german) and most people even know 4 or even 5 languages (second generation kids from immigrants) or highly educated people
Sure there are also immigrants here who only either knows 1 or 2 languages (for example french people only knowing french which is enough since most people know french too)
Luxembourgish as 52% of the population are Luxembourgers
Although in the private sector the most common languages are French and to a lesser extent English
You might hea people mostly talking in French or Englishbwith each other at work, because they're a lot a commuters (over 200k per day) coming to Luxembourg, so Luxembourgers talk to them in the language they are able to speak
>Sounds like a cool place to live for language freaks like me
Definitely
However life can be a bit boring compared to big European cities
Yes its a German dialect (Moselle Franconian)
You would surely understand it
I studied in Vienna and most peoole could understand almost everything
I think most people including myself consider it as a separate language, as it has been enriched by many French words (differentiatly pronounced)
However, the historical roots of Luxembourgish is a German dialect
>Isn't this a controversial matter in Luxembourg
I think the large majority does not care at all
This is why Luxembourgish is not recognized as an offical language in the EU, as the costs of translating every EU documents would be way too high for our small population, that can read them in either German, French or English
Is using Roman numerals for the century number in common writing a Polish thing
I'm not sure if I'm being trolled, but no, I (native British English speaker) was taught to write "thirteenth century" or, more casually "13th century"
Every day's a school day
Well Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg and Luxembourg, from Luxembourg
I'm not sure if the capital Luxembourg city was ever on the second spot
If it ever happened it was somewhere between 1850 and 1975 during the height of the ARBED (later Arcelor) and then Esch-sur-Alzette would have been larger
Esch certainly was more important during that time even getting an airport of its own for a little while
Liège is larger then Brussels
Didn't expect that
No not really, honestly
Depends on how stereotypical the person looks
I just guess if someone has very distinct blonde hair and white skin, he came from north
In general yes but the north is fairly big
Many very different countries
That would be like those fun map divisions Beer Europe/Wine Europe etc, the same Blond Europe/ Brunette Europe
Unless I hear them talk I can't tell
And even then it's not accurate
Most can't tell apart Finnish - Estonian, Latvian - Lithuanian, most Slavic languages
German is spoken over several countries and if you don't know the differences, it's all the same
Fashion choices only work if they are tourists, if they are foreigners living in the country after a few years they dress as locals
yes we have most of those in luxembourgish
except "armes würstchen", we would use  "aarmen däiwel". we also don't use the leberwurst one, I only recently learned about leberwurst/leberkäs, we don't eat that here
Of course we eat Leberwurst and Leberkäs / pâté in Luxembourg
Thing is just that nowadays most people do not eat it anymore
French people often think that Luxembourgers speak only German and german people often think that we speak only French (though not that many) and no one ever thinks that we speak Luxembourgish too
Watching people realize that we speak four languages pretty fluently is so funny
I don‘t know what they think we speak but German people realising that I know more about the grammar of their language than they do is just hilarious
Really
You didn't know this as a Belgian
Aren't all languages made up
The problem is that Luxembourgers immediately switch to another language if they detect that you're not fluent in one
If your German has an accent we switch to French or English and the other way around
French people in shops or restaurants of course don't do that and their English is mostly non-existant
Probably Spanish or Portugueuse (largest minority in Luxembourg comes from Portugal)
People working in restaurants and shops are mostly from nearby France or Belgium so they will expect you to speak French
Our press is mostly in German, sometimes in Luxembourgish or French
Schools start with German and later French
The government speaks in Luxembourgish but laws and official statements are mostly written in French
I don't get that reference
Mostly trilingual or quadrilingual (English gets taught in high school), though some have more of a working knowledge of either French or German depending on their background
Luxembourgers are often better in German, families of portugueuse or italian origin better in French
Most Luxembourgers do
A lot have an immigration background (Portugal, Italy) so they speak another language with their parents than they do with their friends of their own generation or in school
Well this even applies to Luxembourg, there are many different dialects here
Miseler, Minetter, Stater, Éisleker and more, which is crazy if you think about how small the country is
Newest historic research thinks that they were invented in Paris
But I have to admit, the best french fries are always from Belgium
Except the fact is people say ‘Brussels’ regarding European-level decisions because they don’t actually know who they mean
The European Council
The European Parliament
The European Commission
People have very strong opinions about the way the EU runs - but they often don’t actually know anything about it
And most of what they do know is lies told by people like Boorish Johnson
We are the only with Luxembourgish for sure
When you want a more exciting answer, depending on the section you took you get two different math courses
Don't know if that's common or not but I doubt it
Also some courses might never come up in outher countries till university or are subjects like technical drawing taught in college in other countries too
Edit: Other nicher classes include Educi Education of citizenship and it's counterpart Civic which is basically the same
And accounting is a college class as well
We have it as a subpart of later art classes
Danish is okay, I understand the context . Flemish, English, german and Low german is easy
Luxemburgish is home game, since I’m luxemburgish
Yes
Home clothes are nice but not for office
And I have dog walking clothes that can get muddy or torn on branches and I'll not be sorry
According to the Internet it is "um Neiluerenzscheierhaff" (21 letters), single one would be Schlënnermanescht (17 letters)
Honestly Idk, I dont want to sound ignorant but as soon as I cross tje border to germany or belgium it just feels already a lot less rich, some people here even say that the 3rd world starts across the border
(I mean a bus driver earns about 80k at the end of their career here, some engineers with a masters degree dont earn that much in germany)
I have never been to monaco but most other countries where I have been had lot less good infrastructures and were generally more poor
However countries like Sweden, norwegen and Denmark had some places which seemed pretty rich
EDIT: and everybody who says we dont pay taxes, inform yourself lol
Every normal citizen has to pay an income tax which is nearly as high as the one in germany, except for lower salaries, which is fair
Big companies used to get low taxes, which was a Crime and supported by a small elite
Its the main reason why the Juncker governement lost its majority, it nearly destroyed our country
Deauville in Normandy is most definitely the wealthiest place I've ever been to
The entire town consists of expensive estates and as expensive cars parking right in front of them
Even though less then four thousand people live there they got a massive yacht port, a prestigious casino and a horse racing track
A ton of Luxembourgish people buy appartements in and around Knokke and the Belgian coast in general but especially Knokke because its prestigious for whatever reason
While some parts are quite nice calling Knokke overrated is probably warranted
I always thought that it was cool seeing Estonian cars in town because that’s pretty exotic (even if they are in the Schengen area)
It wasn’t until way later that I realised, that the 'E' on the liscence plates in front of the Spanish embassy is in fact for Spain and not Estonia lmao
I also know Russians tell their e-mail address like "name doggy server dot country"
Belgium and Netherlands
As a luxembourger, i never get to cheer on my nation on any tournament so i tend to cheer on germany
In nearly every team sport there is a qualifying phase to qualify for the main tournament
We cant qualify for any tournament because we re too bad to get through qualifying
We played portugal in the qualifying phase of the 2020 european championship
At the soccer match against portugal there were i think more portuguese fans than luxembourgish fans
honest answer: people call us a microstate all the time and it really hurts our feelings :(
>Luxembourg
>Not sure if it's a microstate, to be honest
I rarely think about it
I've been told it's the place to buy Bitcoin from
Officially its not, because we are much bigger than the microstates and we will hit 1million people in the next 20-30 years
We also have a large diaspora on the borders
Luxembourgers are the largest minorities there
For example, in some german and belgian cities, the mayors are luxembourgers
Its all according to our old plan, a growing population and a diaspora to reclaim our land
(especially luxembourg belgium)
Ive never heard that you can buy bitcoin here

What makes you say our placement is unlucky
Is that in  reference to the wars
Because I think it's our strong point haha
I feel like someone should challenge you to come up with an F1 fact for every country
On that note, I grew up around the corner from Bruce McLaren Drive
And had no idea who that was

Luxembourg is not a microstate though
Sure it's small, but compared to microstates, it's huge
that's what my girlfriend keeps telling me
how about centistate and we call it even
we hear it a lot and it hurts our feelings
True, but that also meant that there was no prolonged fighting in our country, so I guess that's a silver lining
this is cute, i like it
a wee state
at least you have coastline
The way it feels from my perspective is that microstate = unimportant
The prefix micro is used as a diminutive both literally and figuratively
Not that there's logically anything wrong with being a microstate, but i believe that deep down everyone wants to feel important
"i have a wee fetish" said the Brit
"oh, what is it
" replied the American
The US is a warmonger and it is time for Europe to get it’s shit together and create their own defense pact without the US
Further destabilisation of the region will undoubtedly create a new refugee crisis and this is the last thing the EU needs right now
We should act in our own interest not that of the US
Can I get all my news from you
Belgium, probably
It's the only country that we'd allow to invade us
O corpo é que paga, by António Variações
One of the best songs I've ever listened to
Unfortunately, many people around the world won't experience it, since it's in Portuguese
You got Luxembourg who loves those songs though ;) Ok granted
we speak the language
A shit the Holz one really boomed in German speaking countries, even 7 year olds always said “Ich und mein Holz” constantly
Being smol and often mistaken as a french or german city
The first with an openly gay prime and highest percentage of workers coming from outside of Luxembourg
Also highest trust in media outlets
Number of official languages ( french, luxemburgish, german ) . 47% of foreigners
Last grandduchy in the world
The front door next to the driver is for entrance only so I say hello when I enter the bus
Exits are in the middle and at the other end which would make it awkward to shout thanks though the entire bus
Can tell it's not native accent but usually can't tell where from
Dutch is a Germanic language, their accents are not that different, for all I know it could just as well be one of the native ones I haven't heard yet
Russian and other Slavic on the other hand are very easy to spot
Written: no
Hearing: yes always
It is easy to point out someone isn't native English speaking
Omg hahaha
“I need you to write that report until Monday” (instead of by Monday) is also a giveaway for Germans
Dutch accents sound the best if we're talking about broken English
Like the Dutch accent in English sounds so cool
I don't think I've ever heard a Flemish person speaking English
Plus I can barely hear a difference between Dutch and Flemish, I am sorry haha
This woman has the cliché Luxembourgish accent
If you ask me, it just sounds like a farmer
No other explanation, we just sound like farmers with a mix of German haha
The best solution would be create a Benelux country with a swiss style federation
(im switzerland every kanton has its own constitution, and every kanton also has its own parliament) like this we would be one of the strongest nations in europe and at the same time it would solve your problen because the interests of minorities would still be protected and the federal governement wouldnt be that important
>You guys all understand Dutch and also act like you do
That's just a lot easier
Well Luxembourgers dont understand dutch but we do understand french
(have to learn it in school)
>Question: why would we Dutch want that
>I mean, you Luxembourg are rich and that's nice, Flanders is good too, but
>Couldn't we donate Wallonië to France
I mean as I said, in a swiss modell the kantons are relatively independent, so there wouldnt be much of a problem
And the dutch would would profit aswell, because their country would become a lot more important from one day to another and at the same time they would stay relatively independent and they could protect their culture
I mean the dutch are always joking about reannexing Luxembourg and Belgium
Oh god please why you had to remind me of our disgrace of a ghetto song
I’m just waiting for that Luxembourgish comment which either says “The North” or “The South” of the country, I’m still waiting
Scrolled down to look for this comment
Also waiting for someone to ask "Wait, Luxembourg has a North or a South
Ha, we often even have three names for villages (official french and/or german and then the luxembourgish one)
Like Ulflingen in German, Troisvierges in French and Ëlwen in Luxembourgish; it's the same town
Town signs feature at least two names
Any kind of rap
Like seriously [here] is an example
If you listen to the lyrics closely, you'll hear nonsense
He doesn't even know what he's talking about
This was life-changing
These would be a great basis for a Sitcom called “Welcome to the Bundes-Irrsinn” which would be similar to “The Office” but with actually no work at all compared to it
It‘s a boring piece of shit
Royal gala, big red, pink lady, granny smith, and at least some 2-3 less known varieties that I have forgotten the names
And 2-3 different pears
Use this to cut the eggs for salad: slice once, turn the egg, slice again perpendicularly, get more or less cubes, mix with whatever else goes in the salad
To actually get heroine you need to add acetic acid anhydride ( simply vinegar wont work lol ) to acetylate the 2 oh groups of morphine ( = diacetylmorphine )
Also you need to transform it into a hcl salt to have a stable compound
So heroin is semisynthetic and while its precursor morphine is found in poppies itself isnt
I think its very hard to actually get a proper yield with very crude methods that these junkies used
But you actually have lots of opiate alcaloids like morphine or its precursor drug codeine ( methylmorphine ) or papverine in opium poppies so to get high no neeed to do that
But heroin is more potent than morphine and due to these acetly groups is a lot more lipophilic and gives a way better rush ( especially iv )
Heroin itself a bit like codeine gets metabolized to morphine in the body ( heroin > monoactylmorphine > morphine ) so it really is the same but gets much more efficient absorbed by tissues
Stay away from opiates
I used tramadol recreationally a few times and while its very nice ( floaty, nodding off) it burns itself into your memory
I found other drugs like dxm or lsd much, much more euphoric than tramadol but its a nice clearheaded, completely worryfree mental high while your body feels very heavy, painfree and warm
You are way more sober in your head than eg benzos or alk or even weed but i you have problems it solves than better than most other drugs, and thats exactly why you shouldnt think about trying it if you have a smwth addictive personality
I know tramadol has serotonin action, and to a junkie it would be to weak and stimmy, but without opiate tolerance it was pure heaven
Its the devil
Its qualitative worryfree euphoria that makes it so tempting, but it not even comes close ( even if i was nodding the fuck off and breathing slowly ) to mdma, weed/dxm, lsd
in terms of quantitative euphoria
Also dont make tea out of poppies you have grown
You can easily kill yourself if you have no tolerance, no way to get a right dosage
Only way would be to extract opium latex and to smoke it
Not that i had ever done it, no thanks
Andy Schleck losing the chain of his bike which prevented him from winning the tour de france for Luxembourg
Dude thanks, now I don't need to come up with a response for Luxembourg
Under the condition that united Benelux doesnt end up like Belgium today because of cultural differences
Luxembourg has a national maximum price on petroleum products (Gasoline, Diesel, Heating Oil etc
) These prices are updated every day
This is also the reason, why so many people cross the border to fill up their car, turn around and drive back home
I'd like to borrow recognition from Germany
Hunnegdrepp meaning honey liquor
I think that gives the taste away
English as language is pretty basic
The only really confusing thing is the spelling: I can’t write a word if it’s spelled letter by letter
At some point I get tangled, give up, and ask to name the letters the German or Spanish way
I lot of towns here get separate Luxembourgish, German and French names
I can't name them all but here are some examples:
Lëtzebuerg (lu) - Luxemburg (de) - Luxembourg (fr)
Ëlwen (lu) - Ulflingen (de) - Troisvierges (fr)
Heischent - Heiderscheid (de + fr)
Iechternach - Echternach (de + fr)
Veianen/Veinen - Vianden (de + fr)
Niederkäerjeng - Niederkerschen - Bascharage
Péiteng - Petingen - Pétange
Kéideng - Ködingen - Koedange
Cliärref/Klierf - Clerf - Clervaux
Wëntger - Wintger - Wincrange
Helzen - Helzingen - Hachiville
As said, this is only an excerpt
Nearly every village in this country will have a slightly different name
There are also some Luxembourgish names for places outside the country
We call:
Paris - Paräis
Aachen - Oochen
Liège - Léck
Brussels - Bréissel
Bastogne - Baaschtnech
The list goes on
The only one we have, Luxembourg
We call it 'Lëtzebuerg' though
Geoportail
lu, it's fantastic
And on mobiliteit
lu there is a map too, mobiliteit
lu and it corresponding app are a service of our public transport but it includes ways by car, e-car, bike, on foot, etc shown on a highly detailed map of our country
It is probably the same map as offered by goeportail but I'm not sure
1€: no idea
maybe instant noodles
Nothing else
Maybe one vegetable
10€: depends on where you shop
can't even get a pizza for 10 bucks in most restaurants so this is hard to answer for me
100€: also depends
Can be one pair of jeans, a shopping cart for 1-3 people (again depends on where you shop) or
idk hha I can't make things up
I can only dream of this haha
AHAHA the 10€ is hilarious
But honeatly, stroopwafels are amazing, I miss them
One of my favorite things to eat
And fuck you because im very hungry now:/
I love octopus w a little oil and garlic
edit : weirdly enough i hate shrimps
Once they are on your plate you eat them, not discuss philosophical problems
Doesn't it rain a lot in Galicia
I would like to go there for a while, a little longer than just tourist visit, may be a few months up to half a year, but no more
Would go to the most interesting places that I have read or seen films about
My Great American Tour
I'm clearly not willing to live there or give up my very cosy European social security
>Portland Oregon
you call it a small city and it has more inhabitants than my whole country
I'd say "Ierzebulli" and "Gromperekichelcher" would qualify
Ierzebulli is somewhere between soup and mashed peas with sausage thrown in and Gromperekichelcher are fried potatoe discs
The German have the later one as well and depending on region call them "Kartoffelpuffer" or "Reibekuchen"
We mostly make French Carbonara with the boyscouts
We once had a Finnish partner group on a camp and they doubled the culinary heresy but not buying any cream because we still had milk there
Can't recommend
Probably just means names for countries that have a different etymological root than the English name
I'd say it's "Renert  _oder de Fuuss am Frack a Maansgréisst_" (which translates to "Renert _or the fox in white tie and man's hight_")
Although I have to admit that I never read it
It's a Luxembourgish adaptation of "Reinecke Fuchs" by the German author Goethe, but with a lot more of political satire mixed in
Or Hildebrandslied
But that happens in the final version as well
He summons an Earth Ghost in the first act (Nacht) and the ghost tells him that he's pathetic and vanishes again
With A2 it's impossible imo
There is so much difficult vocabulary and depth in there, that reading Faust only becomes feasible and enjoyable at B2 or C1 Level
Hell I've studied German nearly all my life now and this is just not A2 material - as far from it as possible
Haha no worries, I'm reading it right now so it's fresh in my memory (and I'm loving it so far
Don't worry, it's a bit unfair as Faust is mandatory for the Abiturklausur (sorry I don't know the English word for that one) in Luxembourg if you take german in your final year, what most people do
So every student from Luxembourg knows some verses by heart and knows the details of the story and it's many many interpretations
It has been like that for almost half a century and it shall always remain like that
(At least no one intended to change that part of the exam so far)
> Still, a very good book
I have to agree with that one, it's far better than Homo Faber, the other 'all time classic' we had to study that year
Yea I really don't like that he is remembered so much for Homo Faber
Fortunately we read _Andorra_ and _Don Juan oder Die Liebe zur Geometrie_ the year before and those were quite good
Do you mean in History, Literature or culture
Because in that case both
Being cramped between 2 grand powers of Europe, you kinda have to look both ways to get along with everyone, which is important if you want to survive between Napoleon and Bismarck
But the upside is, that you can take the best of both worlds an therefore improve your way of life an your culture in general ;)
Well it's complicated
Luxembourgish, German and French are official languages and are therefore used often, but the law itself is written in French so although you can communicate with authorities in any of those languages (and english as well) and they have to awnser you in the same language, the default language if you're contacted by them (parking ticket, Covid-test invitation, etc) is french
&#x200B;
I'd say most people watch TV and read the news predominantly in German and Luxembourgish, but many watch French TV as well
Although it mostly depends on your personnal preferances and what you grew up with
English media is gaining in popularity and many younger Luxembourgers like to watch Netflix in English as well
And of course you shouldn't forget the sizable minorities; almost half of Luxembourgs Residens are immigrants nontheless, who often will consume their media in portuguese, italian, spanish, dutch, croatian, montenegran, polish, ... (you get the idea)
And all of those people have an impact on our culture as well
So in short: it's a big mix of all with a Luxembourgish core
>Does it affect the "national identity" of Luxemburg
It didn't change the national identity but rather became it
Old truely Luxembourgish traditions are still around and won't go away anytime soon
The influence of all the migrants added to this feeling to the point that you could argue Luxembourg became the melting pot that the US always wanted to be
Openmindedness, hospitality and multiculturalism became a big part of our identity and we're proud of it
This has also been happening for a very long time, [a documentary] had noted that already back in the 50s!
&#x200B;
>especially after the world wars i guess
10 points for you
Although the law had been mostly in French since Napoleon reformed everything back in the day, the German sections were all translated in the late 40s.
Well in private, Luxembourgish is used more than German, but the media is consumed more in German than Luxembourgish, so there's that
I detest everything about it
I'm not a football fan so that makes it even more clean cut to me
The FIFA is and has always been one of the most corrupt institutions on the globe
Handing a World Cup to Qatar only proves this to me
However decide to play football in the desert in air-conditioned stadiums should be brought before trial and held accountable for such idiocy seen our climate crisis
Qatar has no history with the sport at all, making it not even comparable to the World Cup in South Africa, a country where football at least is a popular sport
The fact that the stadium in the desert are also build under working conditions comparable to labour camps is merely the final nail in the coffin for a World Cup I believe should just be boycotted
I have heard the term Hellegt Réimescht Räich being used in Luxembourgish, just the _vun Däitscher Natioun_ isn't used very often
So just like in English, it's called Holy Roman Empire, ditching the _Germanic_ part
Short answer: Yes
Long answer: it depends on the teacher
Officially in German until 4e/10th Grade (so age 15-16) an after that in French
But many teachers talk to the kids informally in Luxembourgish, using the appropriate official language only in written form
No, this wasn't stupid at all :D
Most of them do
English is an exception _obviously_, and I believe Economics is only taught in French as you only have that from 11th Grade on if at all
On the other hand, those who have history of arts and music have it only in German
And Math is a bit different, the switch there happens 3 years earlier in 7th Grade
Auto mobile = self walk/move
Politically correct English language
Americans expect the whole world to know what fucked up shit they did to each other 70 or 100 or 200 years ago and avoid the words they used then
Sometimes I feel like they shit in the English dictionary and then tell us not to use it because it stinks
And racism everywhere
For Europe they are all Americans
Agreed
16 in some European countries
Soon there will be no acceptable way to describe anybody who is not paper white
Haha
Luxembourg : rich
Snobby
Finance center

Multicultural ( more foreigners than natives )
Lot of history
By far most important city
International
Picturesque espec old town
Esch : criminal . Drugs
( not srious)
Echternach : Oldest city
East near german border
Has a very nice church — Basilica
Grevenmacher/Wormeldange/Remich : Wine' ( riesling, elbling )
Sunny
Miseler Land
Wiltz : In the north ( éislek - ösling )
Farmers with weird accent, cold
I live in neither of these
What about Malatya
was there in high school:) beautiful city
Luxembourg has 12 places that have the title of a "Stad", meaning "town". Out of these 12 towns, Luxembourg City is the only one to call itself a city since it has over 100k inhabitants
Hey they were busy
I still don't know why but Luxembourg is filled with different dialects
They vary, some may only effect how a specific syllable is pronounced while others have a unique vocabulary
Nearly every major town in the North will have some sort of dialect
It's ridiculous considering the size of the country
So Luxembourgish has its origines in german
As you maybe know german has a lot of dialects
Luxembourgish used to be a german dialect too, but nowadays its an own language - a pretty young one
But yes we do have dialects
Some villages still have their own dialects, but the most important dialects are from the moselle area, from the minette (the south) and from the oesling, which is the north of the country
There used to be more dialects which you could hardly understand, but most of them dont exist anymore
Luxembourg is quite the important financial center
Esch/Alzette used to be very important for our industry but the glory days of our mining industry are long over and this country isn't really vital for Arcelor Mittal anymore
Currently we got the Hub Bettembourg, a new logistics center, the Cargo Center in Luxembourg and then there is the plan to attract the upcoming space mining industry whuch will probably be centered in Luxembourg city as well
It all started with our steel industry and once that started to decline our government started to diversify its efforts to attract a variety of businesses
That's why we tried to become attractive for financiers and the logistic sector and now try to be there at the birth of the space sector
I guess we also have a small IT business running here but that's mainly because IT companies are profiting from our tax system
Luxembourg = Finance
Literally every building is a bank
English: Thanks
Luxembourgish: merci
French: merci
German: danke
Spanish: Gracias
Italian: grazie
Portuguese: obrigado
Russian: spasibo
Dutch: dank
Swedish: Tack
Most of the steel used in the One World Trade Center came from Luxembourg
Echternach
Went there to high school, oldest city in Luxembourg ( funded by Wilibrord in 697 ), was one of the most powerfull monasteries in the early middle age
Very nice stituated near the german border, has also the largest roman villa northern of the alps
5000 people live there
small but fine
If I remember right, there is a community in Romania which speaks nearly the same Language as we in Luxemburg
Don't ask me why, but yeah its true
EDIT: ah there you go:
Half-French half-German here
I was born in Germany but raised in Luxembourg ( I spent only one year in Germany), so I am really divided here
If I can I will identify as both but since I recently also got the luxembourgish nationality I now tend to just say European
However if I have to pick one I tend to say Germany
Interestingly all my siblings who have French as mother tongue identify as French
I rarely manage tl finish all of my dish, especially pasta
So I always take it home with me
The more fancier the restaurant the smaller the portion and you need a looking glass to find it
Big plate, a symbolic piece of food in the middle, some sauce "artistically" smeared on the empty parts of the plate
Feels more like a sample than the real thing
Even those places where the portion size is good, still it's reasonable for an adult to finish it all or so much of it that taking it anywhere doesn't make sense
But yes, restaurants do have boxes for leftovers and there's no problem getting them
I believe the concept of Moscow as the “third Rome” is based on religion, rather than on ties to the ancient empire
From an Orthodox perspective, Byzantium becomes the “second Rome” after the Great Schism (if not after the fall of Rome, I’m not sure), and then Moscow inherits the title after the fall of Byzantium
Moscow thus positions itself as the capital of the third great Christian empire, inheritor and defender of the purest form of the Christian faith
Luxembourg's Kniddelen are delicious
They are flour dumplings (the kind without filling) served with bacon and sometimes they get backed with a little cream and a tiny bit of cheese
I just realised that there's an incredible lack of French replies here so I wanted to answer in there behalf being very familiar with the French culinary scene
It's a crime that Tarte flambée hasn't become as wide spread as pizza
While tarte flambée isn't really obscure (at least I hope so) it should have spread across the globe cause its amazing
For those who don't know tarte flambée is made from a thin dough covered in creme, sliced onion, bacon and sometimes other ingredients such as a variety of cheeses or mushrooms
In contrast to pizza, you can even turn it into a good dessert by making on with caramelised apples
Luxembourg got the exact same thing
We call it Ierzebulli (pea mud)
Kniddelen are definitely underrated as a national dish, even within Luxembourg
I wouldn't be surprised if they are the most eaten traditional food together with Gromperekichelcher
Biterballen are way better though
However they share some similarities to the fricadel, one being that I totally don't want to know all the ingredients
I'd argue that both of those dishes are also by far our best dishes
Being honest, food prices are also different in Germany
I study in Aachen and whenever I go back home I'm shocked at the difference
In Luxembourg Flammkuchen and Pizza have similar prizes with the former being somewhat cheaper and both always cost more then 10€.
Well I think Iertsebulli is also up there, they're far better than traditional _Judd mat Gaardebounen_
I don't know about Rhône but it made its way to Luxembourg
Pain surprise is often served on official government run occasions here
You could always upset everyone by just keeping the name of your country in your language
Serafima
Would even like it for myself but it is very foreign and only met very old women who had the name
I know
The one I was together in language classes should be well over 100 by now
Probably dead
Wasn't even a nice babushka
Still the name has the taste I like
Oh, no, please
My mom read a book nobody else knew about and liked one personage there and now I have an ugly name and nobody even remembers the book
No, I didn't read it, tried but it was way too boring even with the added curiosity about my name
If you need a Latvian name ask here, the system is too chaotic to explain, but I can tell if the one's you picked from a phone book or wherever do sound ok
Being between Germany and France was probably the most fucked up location a tiny country could have
Kind of explains our national logo "we want to stay who we are". Today we love our neighboors though
I feel that
Please not, you guys already took half of our country
Revenge is sweet haha
Not for Christmas but for Sylvester/New Year's Eve everyone's watching [Dinner For One]
Letzeboia
Not really a thing, but we had the [Peasant's War] over 200 years ago
In our language it's still called War of the bats because the peasants revoluted against french taxes with bats and scythes as they didn't have any guns
In Luxembourg, the first 6 years of primary school are entirely taught in German
The following 7 years of highschool are then taught in French
However kids with an immigration background, which are very common,  have difficulties with the german in primary school
Oh boy, here in Luxemboug we are obligated to learn 4 different languages
The first language I learned was luxembourgish, in the first grade we started to learn german (nowadays its french as far as I know), in second grad we started to learn french and in 8th grade we started to learn english
I some classes you also have to learn an additional language like spain, italian or portuguese
(I visited a class with a lot of maths, languages werent our priority)
Our school books are either in french or german
(math books mostly in french for example)
But the courses are usually held in luxembourgish (while using french or german books)
Well the first 6 years aren't entirely in German
You start to learn French in 2nd or 3rd grade
Only non-language classes (like math, physics, history) are in German for 6 years (aka
primary school) and one by one switch to French in secondary school
And don't forget that you learn English too, starting in 8th or 9th grade
Of course they dont teach French in German
Yes, but as you described it, you could think that you learn French only in secondary school, and don't learn any English, which is not the case
And the prevalence of French in secondary depends on if you're doing classique or technique
Technique remains mainly German
I live in a town so there isn't a huge identity linked to it even if there are noticeable differences in between Luxembourg's towns
There are dialects to be found in single towns
I feel most at home within my region and that even past Luxembourg's border as the Ardennes are mainly Belgian and extended a little into Germany on top of covering Luxembourg's North
Due to the Luxembourgish language I do also somewhat adhere to our national identity
Worcestershire sauce
Mainly because more than half the letters aren't pronounced and the other half make sounds that are foreign to my native language
_Kaweechelchen_
Yea, checks out
Thanks to the Québec Canada is incredibly close to France, Belgium and also Luxembourg
Luxembourg has some nice natural reserves
I suggest looking up the "Naturpark Our", "Naturpark Obersauer" and the "Mellerdall". Posting a single picture wouldn't properly represent those regions and posting a dozen galleries isn't tgat productive either
The Mellerdall should be the most unique and beautiful place
It's also called Luxembourg's little Switzerland
There are several lakes in Latvia with similar floating islands
Ops
Sorry
On November 6th, 2002, [Luxair Flight 9642] from Berlin to Luxembourg crashed 2 miles short of the runway
It was caused by an error of the pilot, due to thick fog
It is our only commercial plane crash since WW2, and claimed 20 lives, including [Michel Majerus] a decently famous Luxembourgish artist
Every frenchman: "You don't pay taxes" and "So how is it to be rich
"Where are you from
"I'm from Luxembourg
:)"
"OMG it's so rare to find a Luxembourger
What is it like being rich
"Yeah well,... not everyone is rich here you know
"But Luxembourg is like a little Switzerland right
"Not really
"Okay, but can speak Luxembourgish
Is it even a thing
Isn't like a German dialect
*"No
Very symbolically in Luxembourg
But February is usually quite cold, there may be some snow still this winter
We have had snow in April
I'd you're counting Luxembourg
Advantages are ambitious programs like free public transport and legalisation of recreational weed
Certain goods are very cheap (alcohol, cigarettes, petrol)
One big disadvantage I see and I think this might be a bit unique to Luxembourg, is the apparent parallel societies of Luexmbourgers and foreigners/their descendants
I guess anywhere people foreigners and natives will keep to themselves but it feels much more pronounced because of the small size of Luxembourg and disproportionate amount of foreigners
Oh, and it can get real fucking boring here
Some Luxembourgers resent the fact that Luxembourgish is slowly losing in numbers and therefore don't like speaking French/German/English
Which I do understand, death of ones own language is always sad
Not that it excuses them being rude to you
I do doubt that it was because you're a minority though, I myself am one and have never felt like people have treated me differently because of it
That's Liechtenstein
Finnish - so melodic
Scottish English - sexy
Spanish
Greek and French are absolutely beautiful
I hear French quite enough in my daily life but I rarely hear Greek being spoken in public which I wish would happen more
Silbo
And the spoken version - Guanche
We celebrate it with "three kings cake" (roughly translated) a pie made from puff pastry with frangipane filling, sometimes with apples to present an alternative
Inside the cake/pie there's a little figurine
Whoever finds it gets to wear the cheap cardboard crown you get with the cake/pie
That's all we really do to celebrate the 6th of January
Sorry I got no recipe
Never baked one
I checked and you will find at when searching French Galette des rois
If it qualifies, there is the famous (in Luxembourg) "Mir wölle bleiwe wat mir sinn" or in English "we want to remain who/what we are". It comes from a well known song text by Michel Lenz and is our country's motto
If a part of a song text doesn't qualify it's probably "Hier steh ich nun ich armer Tor und bin so klug als wie zuvor" from Goethe's Faust because half of all people in the country where forced to memorise quotes from that book in school
I would love to read smth from Pessoa, but can't speak Portuguese unfortunately
Did he also write novels (that you would recommend)
I'd feel less bad to read a translated novel than translated poetry
Our gov didnt want IKEA in our country (dont remember why)
.. So they built it literally 100metres away from our border on the belgium side
Nevertheless, IKEA is pretty popular here, but its also seen as a low budget furniture store with furniture that you only can build once
France also has good cider but they treat it completely different handling it like wine while on the British Isles it's handled more like beer
I generally prefer the English kind but French red cider is delicious and every local cider in Normandy is just excellent easily beating most brewed in England
Not making fries like a Belgian is just doing it wrong
I can accept steakhouse fries in some cases like served with fish and chips but in general Belgian fries are great while other countries fry cardboard
Belgium has some great cheese coming from its abbeys as well
Goes well with the beer
Belgium cheese is quite soft while remaining a rigid cheese, so nothing like brie
Even though Luxembourg is tiny there is a massive discrepancy between the North and the South
In the North you will still find snow in April in some places
In the South you will see the last of it mid march if it even stays so long and or snows at all
The North of Luxembourg is part of the Ardennes and so subject to quite some snowfall
The couple last years have been lacking snow in general though
They are accepted but at the same time you don't see them on people with high paying jobs
Latvia: three main confessions (Catholic, Lutheran, Russian Orthodox) and a bunch of smaller ones all claim they have 50-90% of population as followers but in reality very few people are actually religious
Up to the point where one clergy person circles through all the churches on a schedule instead of having one per church
So most likely atheist or indifferent is the default
Spanish, Italian and some slavonic language
I already speak English, German and French, so Spanish and Italian seem like logical next choices, maybe Chinese would be smarter then Italian though and then any slavonic language, because once I know one, I heard it's quite easy to pick up more
Same in Luxembourg
On sunday we often go to my gradmas house
Then my father, his brothers and me usually start to talk about something
It usually gets louder and louder and at some point its like shouting
Its always fun
Not much
Those who already have a job, usually get the minimum wage which is about 1900 or 2300 when you are qualified
Most of them either still live at home or in very small appartements because housing is too expensive and you cant afford anything with those salaries
(especially not around the capital)
However when you work for the state, then you will usually earn much more
When you have a master you will get around 5500 the first year
After 3 years its already at 7000
It will go up until 16000 at the end of your career
With a bachelor it is a bit less an with a highschool diploma also less
But in order to work for the state you have to pass several exams
Thats why everything here is fucked up
You wont earn anything in the private sector and at the same time you will earn a bunch of money in the public sector
>Banking there pays well tough, no
Depends
50% of the banks left since 2008 so its hard to get a good job
Our salaries dropped because of the frontier workers, they are ready to do the job for 2k because after taxes its still 1800 (you dont pay much taxes when you dont earn a lot)
But its devastating for the people who live here
We also have 50% immigrants here which were also ready to do those jobs for much less money
However today they suffer the most under this situation, because Luxembourgers can work for the state and get a nice salary, but nom-Luxembourgers are not allowed
A bus driver who is a state employee earns about 6k before taxes, in the private sectore they only earn about 2,5k thats insane
The North would be more populated, have less thick accents and be more diverse in terms of nationaliyy/country of origin
If infrastructure and housing switched places too, it would be way more developed-ish and less rural
Luxembourg would have the highest density of population in the whole world in the North and the lowest in the South
It would be a huge problem as the North has not enough place to have so many people and in the South each person would own a street of houses
It's not
I think it is illegal in all of Europe and should get you a fine
This doesn't mean that public urination doesn't happen in larger cities though
Especially cities filled with tourists
Amsterdam handles the problem really well with their public FREE urinals
On another note discreetly pissing into the woods or bushes at the side of the road outside a city is ok
You my friend obviously haven't heard angry francophone people honk at you yet
Just honk at least once a day
Passive aggressively
I thinks its our usage of 3 languages ( luxemburgish, german, french ) in daily life, written and spoken
It can be very confusing
You got the right way of doing things, I like it
Well here no one expect you to buy your own house or apartment nowadays anymore (at least those I know including my friends and so)  ( today it got announced that [prices increased by a lot even during the pandemic ] More and more people get higher education compared to the past so the least go to work with 16 now
Since nobody lives there can we have it back
Pretty neat
I can get to Germany, France and Belgium within 30 minutes haha
I live in Luxembourg not unusual to pass by our three neighboring countries in a single day
Hello neighbour
Do you live in Trier
Just the most obvious one
I think they save paper and put pages in languages according to where they send the stuff to
It's super annoying here as all instructions and medicine leaflets don't have the English version
I bought one 10 years ago, it's still in the kitchen
Although my husband likes all modern stuff and we have another one with bells and whistles
And why not peel them over the right bin
Thanks, I'll try it
If I do potatoes I sit in front of the bin, elbows on knees, peels fall in the bin
Easy
Drive
Try walking in high heels on cobblestones
If you can then try it after a drink
De Feierwon is a clear pick here seen how it was a contender to be our national anthem
Luckily it isn't because it directly brings up Prussia and would thus have aged quite poorly
Reasons for luxembourgish:
Only about 300-400k are speaking luxembourgish which means it would be a fair choice because 99% would have to learn it
If it's interesting bet I've been there at least once
Within about 50-100 km
Also within 5 km walked all the shortcuts between houses, unnoticeable paths to the forest/in the forest, even local Ikea shortcuts
Medicine, IT, Economics, Law degrees are paid well
School teacher is also an option ( yeah thyre paid highest in the world )
50% is employed by the state so you have a stable job and get paid very well ( but never well enough to buy a house
Its terrible )
From personal experience i know way too many people who study psychology, we dont even need that many
Im biology student ( bsc ) in Germany , but plan to work in Luxembourg ( first in research, then idk ) in ecology/ conservation or neuroscience
In Luxembourg it is inevitable to not know french atleast and english ( latter mainly in it )
Laws are written in french so there is no way around it
Luxembourgish and German are also nice to know, but especially the latter is not that important
Biology it depends things like biotech or genetics are growing very fast and paid well, classic disciplines like zoology, ecology (:/) or botany dont have that many jobs or job growth
But i expect conservation biology to become much more important due to climate crisis, extinction and pollution — we depend on it
The easiest way for me would to be teacher in a high school, but i dont think i would have the nerves to do that :p.
Best to do is studying medicine, we have way to few doctors and source large amounts of medical professions from France or Belgium
But i was never interested in it, especially interactions with patients was a no go for me
Just move to luxembourg, do a master in a subject you are interested in, apply for a job in the public sector (well you have to become Luxembourger first) an earn 6100 pre tax in your first year
However, If you apply for a job in the private sector your salary will be around 3k even for engineers
So yeah in Luxembourg a philosopher in the public sector earns more than an engineer in the private sector
(not native luxembourger here, but lived long enough)
from what i've experienced, a conbination of german and english is already pretty good, and you'll get away with not knowing any luxembourgish
the real mvp is french, though, as it's the most commonly known and used language in day to day situations
if you've gone through the luxembourgish school system, you'll be fluent in at least french, german, and luxembourgish
Da du sowieso Deutsch redest kann ich auch auf Deutsch antworten
Mit Deutsch alleine kommst du hier nicht mehr so weit, vieleicht im Osten (aber obs du dort eine Arbeit finden würdest welche deinem Diplom entspricht bezweifele ich) oder in einzelnen Unternehmen, aber sonst ist Französisch und Englisch schon ein Muss
Englisch allerdings auch nur in der Finanzbranche und einzelnen Unternehmen
(auch IT)
Französisch ist aber natürlich ein Muss
Sogar unsere Gesetzgebung ist auf Französisch
Luxemburgisch solltest du als Deutscher auch recht schnell lernen
Die Sprache wurde zwar nach dem 2Wk "entgermanisiert" und trotzdem ist sie immer noch eine germanische Sprache
Im Gegensatz zu den Franzose verstehen auch die meisten Deutschen nach ein paar Jahren lux
Aber naja ich sags mal so, wenn du einen Job in Deutschland oder Österreich findest, wo du auch noch eine gute Rentenvorsorge findest, dann würde ich auf jedenfall als Ausländer in diesen Ländern bleiben
Der Immobilienmarkt ist unmöglich, man zahlt für ein 30m2 Studio auf dem Land 200k €.
Gleichzeitig gibt es im Privatbereich Lohndumping, da die vielen Grenzgänger und teilweise auch Immigranten (wobei dies eher früher der Fall war - Luxemburg hat 50% Ausländeranteil) die Löhne halt extrem drücken
Klar im Finanzsektor und in verschiedenen IT Firmen kann man auch viel verdienen, aber solch gute Jobs findet man auch bei euch
Über 50% der Luxemburger arbeiten für den Staat
Dort gab es kein Lohndumping und ähnliches
Ein Busfahrer der für den Staat bzw Gemeinde fährt, verdient fast 6000Brutto (wegen Schichten usw) im Privatsektor sind es oft nicht mal 3000 (der Mindestlohn beträgt knapp 2000)
Aber ja wie gesagt, wenn du aber etwas studiert hast wo du keine Ahnung hast was du arbeiten sollst, dann lohnt sich der Luxemburger Staat definitiv
6000 Anfangsgehalt und mit Promotionsexamen kann das bis auf 11k raufgehen (dann zahlt man allerdings 50% Steuern) und das ist auch hier verdammt viel
my parents both work in the financial sector, don't speak a word of french, and get along just fine, so i guess it also depends on the industry
and actually originally from your big neighbor country, poland
Rip Luxembourg
Takes more than four beers and 11:45 pm but definitely a dürüm
Being in the middle of nowhere is often called "in the middle of the Pampa" or also "um Hond hannen": at the dog's behind
Tell him "We only release them at night
There will be next time, promise
That could just mean that the law works as intended don't you agree
I see, so you don't think the law is working as intended
Or just unnecessary
You finish high school at either 19 or 20
The year you start school isn't based on the calendar year you're born in but rather on the academic year
Edit: there's 6 years of elementary school and 7 of high school
Ettelbréck's name originates from the town's history
Apparently the Huns under Attila crossed the Alzette there
Ettel comes from Attila while Bréck is Luxembourgish for bridge thus coming together as Attila's bridge
Edit:
I also know the origin of Luxembourg so I might as well share it here
It's was named after a castle that was build there
Lucilinburhuc was the name given to it meaning little castle and from there the name Luxembourg evolved
Interesting
Luxembourg city has a district called Hamm
That one probably has the same origin then
University of Luxembourg
Why
Because it's the only one
That does sound fun
All-around great comment, 10/10
I mean, "pecuniary turpitude" – Google results show that you're the first person to write those words since 1885
Anything over 50kph is high-speed to Americans
Yep
Horses running and huts burning
I had the same problem coming up with a Luxembourgish one
For Luxembourg I guess that the French beignets count because we somewhat share culinary culture with France
Maybe that there is a similar situation for Switzerland of foreign dumplings crossing the border
As I don’t live in the country that issued my passport it’s always a pain in the ass to renew that or ID card
Involves lots of traveling either to my country or to the nearest embassy which is not near at all, need a few days off work to get there on a working day working time
So from practical point I would love to be able to renew an EU passport in the place where I actually live
EU member states
Why are you asking
I’m very sure this situation is not unique for country combination or people
I'd say Juncker, we basically just chased him out and sent him to Brussels
I believe that you should have a right to decide over the politics of the country you reside in
It also makes sense in an ever mire globalised world and the especially interconnected countries of Europe
I'd also say that this could help against the rise of far right populism because I rather doubt that immigrants are all that happy with xenophobic rhetoric
Non di Jëfft nach mol - when someone isn't behaving
Non di Kass - when someone isn't behaving
Schmonk mer de Gatt (Jéinesch) - Suck my a**
My native language - no
My husband's native language - no
The language of the country we both live in - no
Sometimes it's a challenge to find native speakers within the respective country
It's mostly English everywhere
Occasionally some of the other big languages like German, French, Russian
I live in Luxembourg and for work reasons I was in 5 different countries in one day: Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands
It’s so easy
Shitty roads, amazing beer and friendly Walloons
We would have access to the sea if it weren't for those meddling Belgians
> stopped at a rest area near Liège
Well, that was a mistake
Well y'all have Belgium, WI
wait a minute
During the day my room is about 21-23 degrees
In the morning and during the night 15-18 degrees
20-23\*C depending on how far from radiators or windows the thermometer stands
We don't even use all the radiators that are in the apartment and ones we do use are not full on, both right now and in colder winter too
The best option for unsafe places is to have that special wallet you toss to the mugger, one with a few shops client cards without your name, expired better, a bit of coins, some notes not too much
Believable but not your whole life in it
I was driving through a small town somewhere in the middle of Poland
There was a family waiting by zebra crossing
I stopped
They looked at me like I had 2 heads
Crossed
The father almost kissed the ground in front of my car
I looked at them like they had 2 heads
Clearly they never expected a car to stop
Definitely Schueberfouer, it dates back to October 1340 created by John the Blind (John I of Luxembourg, king of Bohemia)
It is the biggest fair in Luxembourg and the Greater region, one of the largest in whole Europe with annually over 2 million visitors within 3 weeks
(born and raised in )
Both sweet and salty popcorn are good in their own ways

I could maybe buy an apartment when I'm lucky
Usually you don't get real estate in Luxembourg under 500k.
There's event that thing called Paris syndrome - extreme disappointment after a visit to Paris
Fun fact : Diacetylmorphine aka heroine was discovered by felix hoffmann
Albert hofmann ( swiss ) discovered lsd
Our capital has a quarter that's at the bottom of a valley and is simply called Grund (ground)
Another quarter is called Neudorf (new village), coincidentally also in a valley
Yep, the city has a lot of valleys
Pros: High wages, very easy to visit France, Germany or Belgium, some nice castles, many languages spoken by the entire population, politics are not nearly as divise as in other countries, economy is doing well and the future looks pretty bright
&#x200B;
Cons: Constant and I mean CONSTANT construction sites everywhere, nightlife is pretty lame, a lot of trafic, the country (esp the north) is not well connected even though it's pretty small
It has already been dealt with to an extent and our economy is diverse enough to take a beating
Also it’s not an issue because we are a sovereign country and we can decide how we want to collect taxes
It’s perfectly legal and nobody can argue otherwise because there are no international guidelines on how to collect taxes
We are certainly not an island somewhere in the ocean that belongs to the UK
Housing and rent prices
It gotten so BAD that lots of young people live in Belgium or Germany because they cant afford it
Believe me
Its worse here
Depends on how you look at it I guess
Some trace our state, the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, as far back as 963, when Count Siegfried obtained the "Bockfiels" and a castle called " Lucilinburhuc" from the monastery in Trier in exchange for some land around what is today Liège in Belgium (if I am not mistaken)
We existed as a county in the HRE for some time and also a dynasty, known as the Luxembourg dynasty, ruled the HRE, Bohemia and apparently Hungary for some time between 1308 and 1437
The fate of Luxembourg was linked to the city and fortress of Luxembourg
I could say more about the general history of it, but that would go to far
The state we know today has really been born in the year 1839, when we got our independence because a treaty inside the family (Nassau-Family-pact ?), that ruled the Netherlands at the same time, forbade an female heir to the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, which ended the personal union between the Dutch and the Luxembourgish
Something like that
A few years back I would have been able to answer this question a lot better, but since then I needed the space in my brain for other stuff
So here have some wikipedia links with some more general info of those topics I mentioned briefly:
963
Count Siegfried I ( founder of the house of luxembourg, but which has NOTHING to do with dynasty of Luxembourg/Nassau, our current monarchs ) bought Lucilinburhuc ( little castel ) on the Bockfels, which today is in Luxembourg City ( also the name of the country originated from there )
1354 — its now a dutchy
After 1815, its a grandduchy
Real indepence so to say comes in 1890  ,  when the personal union with Willhelm I of Netherlands ended ( sexist reasons) and the current monarchy ruled
Before this, Luxembourg was ruled by HRE ( some emperors in 15 century where from House of Luxembourg), Spanish Netherlands, Personal union with Netherlands
Also 2 short occupations by our lovely neighboors in the 20th century;)
Luxembourg today is the only Grandduchy to exist and as Liechtenstein, a relict from the HRE
Situated between France and Germany, which led to a few nasty disputes in the 19th century
Also from 15—1850 approx, Luxembourg was known as the Gibraltar of the North due to massive fortifications of the main city — it was destroyed because F and DE wanted it, you can see the remnants as the Kassemattes and a few walls in L. City
This strategic value as buffer was the main reason because were indepent today and not absorbed in France or Germany
In Luxembourg you either know someone with a van and ask them for a favour (like we do for almist everything) or you rent one
I don't know many people who drive around with drywall, construction enterprises are the only ones and they all drive around in vans
Moving couches, as said, you either have connections or you rent
A lot of people will also just get creative and with enough imagination most things fit into regular cars
Yes
It was a nightmare because of the god awful kitchen and teacher wasn’t the nicest
Does most of people know how to cook
I'm a US citizen from birth, but I'm a Luxembourg citizen thanks to their citizenship-by-ancestry program
I did not have to learn Luxembourgish
I know that a nation's language is important to its cultural identity, but I think there are cases where learning it shouldn't be necessary
For instance, I speak French, so I have no issue interacting with my countryfolk
For me, learning Luxembourgish would occupy mental resources and might ultimately detract from my ability to contribute to the economy
But in a country like Germany, where the national language is used in the workplace, I think learning the language should be mandatory
tldr, learning the language should be required only when you can't function in society without it
I pretty much know everyone in the neighbourhood and am acquainted to most of them
There's a lot of Portuguese immigrants in the street so we all get along very well
We also throw a neighbourhood party every year in May, where everyone is invited to come to the party organizer's yard and eat lunch/dinner
That's about it in Luxembourg
In 2008, the Grand Duke vetoed a law that would have legalized euthanasia, so Parliament amended the constitution to take away his legislative power
The tv series Battlestar Galactica used the word 'frack' as a replacement for 'fuck'. Completely unrelated but that word is an often used actual swear word in Luxembourgish
Because they were afraid to actually call some kind of demon they don't know exists and don't know how to sent it back where it came from
Even if they don't believe demons exist in the first place
Err on the safe side
Luckily the new Dublin bus  didn't show up there
The linguistic origin goes back to the german 'verrecken' which means 'to die a wretched death', but it is used the same as 'fuck' though with no sexual conotation and not in verb form
Maybe they are stuck in some cinema space somewhere
Of course
We call them Frittebuud
Came here to say this
Legend
Most of our contribution is historical
Being a founding member of the EU, housing a lot of institutions and having housed the Union as a whole back in the days
Of course I should also mention that the Schengen agreement is named after the Luxembourgish town it was (partially, it was on tge German border) signed in
I guess the Benelux nations can claim to be the spiritual fathers of the Union as a whole
Founding members of the ECSC:
Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany
Luxembourg is more like one big suburb when it comes to how it feels like
The country has hundreds of towns though
Most have less then 10k inhabitants but what do you expect in a country of 600k people
Benelux area
This doesn't fully apply to Luxembourg but Belgium and the Netherlands are the most densely populated countries on earth
As said, most of Luxembourg feels like one suburb
There are tons of villages with barely three people living there but they are never more then 5 minutes by car apart from each other
Not quite
Most of the North is but forests and fields
It's complicated
I'd suggest geoportail
lu as the best mapping tool for Luxembourg
You can swap it to English and they got all kinds of maps, probably giving you the best possible overview of it all you'll get without visiting
Odd, the English wikipedia page on Vetrov doesn't seem to mention Scheer at all
The mayor of our third largest city did renovation works on his backyard shed without approval from the Ministry of Environment
He was forced to resign as both mayor and MP
12 municipalities have town/city status
Not restricted to just one nationality but in many European countries I've been to the locals ask "are you a jew
" If you're stingy or overly concerned about money
Mentioning only the ones that were not mentioned here already
We have some of those Latvia too but apparently translated from other languages
Pay in Polish money = steal
Dressed like an English lord = very well dressed
Annoying like a Lithuanian beggar
Safe as in a Swiss bank
Smart as a Jew
Mongolian tugrik = worthless currency
Tokyo = far away place
Same here, we have a similar character, who's completely black and he is knows for punishing bad children by whipping the with branches
Thank God none as said something against it for now
Remich had a new gare routiere installed a few years back, so that’s something
My dad calls me "Quetschi" which is the cute form of prune
and my mom used to call me "Mausi", cute form of mouse lol
Cigarette littering
Agree 100% but I have a question
I was born and raised in the states so I was circumcised at birth
My question is this: is circumcision mostly a "my loss" sort of thing, or will potential partners (either women or gay men) be turned off by it
Idk really but everyone does it
More fines and biodegeagable filter should be mandatory
Or smoke with joint filters:)
Thats sadly only a part of the problem
Tobacco accumulates heavy metals and radioactive elements while growing,  also Nicotine itself is toxic for the environnement
At the Attert there is the Kropemann
It's a man living in the river and when children come to close to the river and don't pay attention, he hooks them in
Nowadays the tale is used as an excuse for the Kropemannsfest a festival in Redange and to sell you baguettes with a hook there
I'm losing my mind over this, people don't drink their own alcohol
I've lived in Luxembourg, UK, Netherlands and people always drink their own stuff at a party
I've never been to a party in Luxembourg where you brought your own drinks
That's not really a custom here
The Red Lion sucks though
A flag should be simple, a kindergartner should be able to draw it
Try that with the red lion
How many tails
Are they split or not
And what's with the boner
Red-White-Blue forever
Yeah, the Luxembourgish flag sucks, I hope we change that one already
Something
with Afri-Cola
/r/whereisthis/
Ha, it's "Kaweechelchen". Try pronouncing that
No idea about the origin of the name though
Kaweechelchen coming from Kau Eicheln meaning an animal that eats Nuts (acorn) And I see that it could be pretty difficult for non native speakers
Eggs go in the fridge
Never seen any other way
I thought it was Americans who didn’t keep eggs in the fridge
My line is rather between plane and car
I find trains very stressful because:
I have to watch out for my stop, for the transit stop, for any foreign language announcements that go something like "if you are travelling to A destination, you have to be in B numbered carriage, the others will go to C or to depot". Mind the name of A destination is one of 10 the city has in different languages and not necessarily the one I know, I have forgotten which number carriage I was on, if my destination is not A then I have to know at least 2 different lines to deduct if my stop is on the way to A or to C. Also too often trains just stop at a small town in the middle of nowhere and announce they are not going any further, do what you want, if they feel generous they give you a bottle of water
At midnight, after travelling the whole day, when you expected to be at your destination by afternoon
Luggage
Kinda there is no restriction, but how much can I carry
And you have to leave your suitcase far away from your seat and just hope somebody doesn't mix it with theirs
Tags don't help if "mixing" happens on purpose
This is mostly about Belgian and somewhat about German trains
In Latvia trains are reliable and spacious
So I go by plane if it's just me and stay at the destination short time, which means I only have a small luggage, short parking time at the airport, short dog and child sitter time
If it's a longer vacation and involves hauling over family (kids, dogs, side gig stuff) which would mean tickets for all people, expensive tickets and restrictions how many dogs can be on a flight, lots of luggage to manage, then I go by car
Stuff them all in job done
So far I mostly used the plane but not because I like it
Sadly it remains cheaper for a lot of places and I mostly crossed larger bodies of water when travelling in Europe to go to Crete, Ireland, England, Mallorca and Finnland
For other trips I travelled a lot by car and camper to places like Brittany and Denmark
I plan to start train trips after the pandemic however and visit places like Barcelona and Prague making travel by train more convenient
In my opinion you can't draw a proper line between train and plane by distance because it really depends on train tickets and network density
Depends on the length of the trip as take-offs are the most damaging part of the flight
Taking a huge metal bird into the air is incredibly energy intensive while flying at great heights is comparatively tame and thus over long distances planes can win out against cars
It is really difficult to give ultimate statements though as it also really depends on how many people are in the car
A little bit the Second World War when the country had a real enemy that re-enforced the national identity
Apparently I have quite the Luxembourgish accent but Juncker became president of the european commission with on so whatever
In Luxembourg we speak french and german fluently but we have a luxembourgish accent in both
German people react by ignoring the accent most of the time
Sometimes they ask us where we're from and then give us compliments on how good our german is
In Belgium its exactly the same with the french language
French people however immediatly tell us that we re not french, that we have a strong accent, that it sounds funny and so on
If we say a mistake, most people mock us on that too and dont take us seriously
We got Fausti
He is one of our most famous musicians but it isn't very serious music
I think they are around a long time, decades, even cheap ones have this double function
yeah the eyeball spoon thing was really weird
Latvia: men shake hands but women usually not
I have managed to avoid handshakes for many years
Luxembourg city, the capital of Luxembourg country: I live about 5 km from work
That would take me 10-20 minutes by car but as the government doesn’t allow car parkings any more I have to go by bus and that takes me at least an hour and a half each way
Not possible by bicycle as part of the short way is up a cliff like up a wall
The same for walking: in rain or dark that cliff is a killer
Would have to go around and that ads distance
Also totally relay on car for all food shopping
I walk or take the bus everywhere
Love it and not tempted at all to consider getting a car
I have a yearly travel card and that’s it
No need to pay on spot or scan anything
Cash, card or you can send a text
Although public transport will be free here soon
We're making public transport free in March and I haven't had to pay for it in years, so I actually don't really know
Being asked if that isn't a part of Germany happens nearly never but when someone asks it the blood starts boiling
He means the cherry plum, or mirabelle
I don't care for football but I'll be there when we get you for calling it soccer
You just can't do that
More seriously now, in general any sport has the potential to end in violence once alcohol gets involved
In Europe, basketball and handball can be quite popular depending on the region, even ice hockey in a more limited circle
There's however not much to be said about Europe as a whole there and violent fans are rare outside of the world of football
In Luxembourg football is untouchable, especially among Portuguese communities, followed by basketball
Cycling is also extremely popular in the country but the Tour de France isn't known for hooligans
And it was a Dutch who first translated Japanese into a European language
He documented Hiragana and so on
Edit: The Portuguese were the first, however around 3000 loanwords from Dutch were used at some point and several remain today
There even was a study called 蘭学, which translated to Dutch learning
Oh you‘re right, I‘m sorry
I will edit it
Learning Luxembourgish isn't easy because there aren't enough courses to do so
It is hard to fit in like you where born in Luxembourg, however nobody will ever care
Our capital is becoming increasingly English speaking so French is loosing importance making it more immigrant friendly
In general people here do prefer to speak Luxembourgish, but we are so used to speaking four different languages all the time that immigrants should have a manageable situation
Luxembourg is however hyper unfriendly to everyone when it comes to housing
No, Monday is not a day off
However, I get credited 1 extra day off to use when I please
Bare minimum once, average twice, often 3 or 4 times depending
I'm a personal trainer
People often joke about the northern part of Luxembourg which is called Oesling or Eisleck (in Luxembourgish)
Its 30% of the country but compared to the rest not much people living there
We often joke that the only things that exists there are incest, hayfields and forest
They also got only one big road and have a weird accent
The other part of the country is called "Gudland" which literally means "Good Land", I mean this says enough
*This was written by the Gudland Gang*
> > _"Gudland"_
Dude, you can't even spell "Guttland" (English orthography: "Gutland") correctly
This proves why Éislek-people are better ;D
Jokes aside, the main reason why the North is still so sparsely populated is that there are laws in place, that prevent small towns from growing as fast as they could
Which is a shame, because keeping these places artificially small just adds to the shortage on the housing market
I thought the national consensus would be looking down on Esch-Alzette
The only one I can think of that's actually in Luxembourgish:
[Ech Wees Et Nik-Weakonstruction]
[Bommeleeër Affär] stuff for some serious spy films and conspiracy theories
i can tell you that the tram in luxembourg is absolutely unnecessary
>I know that Luxembourg is a country and a region of Belgium
Yes because it used to be part of Lux but after the belgian revolution, belgium gained its independence from the netherlands and we didnt
(in a first step)
We even wanted to be a part of belgium because we also fought with them in the revolution
However Luxembourg was property of the dutch King (we werent part of the netherlands, we were his private property)
And because of Luxembourg he was part of the german bund
Furthermore he had the status of a grand-duc in the german bund
Luxembourg back then was splitted in half
The one half spoke french and the other one a very early version of luxembourgisch, considered as luxembourgish german
After the revolution they gave the french speaking part belgium
So we didnt gain our independence and we also lost 50% of our land
But no worries we will reconquer the province de luxembourg in a first step (simply put luxembourgers there who live there and then claim the land, the same what putin did with the crimea and yes its already happening) and after that a BeNeLux Country under great luxembourgish rule will be established
And then it will be about to conquer the Ruhrgebiet in germany
After this the country should be strong enough to start establishing a european country, under luxembourgish rule of course
All according to our old plan which still lies in the drawer of our grand duc
I feel offended
We are small but we exist
I think we in Luxembourg officially have a "high consumption" of cigarettes and alcohol apparently but it is mostly outsiders buying them
If you pay like 2€ less per pack, it does add up
It is absolutely not unnecessary, traffic in Luxembourg city is already a disaster today
In future it‘s even gonna be worse
The tram is one of many solutions to this problem
Your sin shall never be forgotten
For the longest times (decades), last year highschool students had to read *La Peste* by Camus and Goethe's *Faust*
Other common reads in the last 2-3 years of highschool include *L'étranger* (Camus), *Das Parfüm* (Süskind), *Die Verwandlung* by Kafka and, in English, *1984* and *Of Mice and Men*
Interesting, we read a lot of the same books
Faust, Die Physiker, Jugend ohne Gott etc
In the last year of secondary education we read "Der Trafikant” as well
Have you ever heard of that book
It's not common, and almost always it's either the long hair and beard viking combo, or it's the hipster/hippie man bun thing
I don't know how any individual personally feels about anybody else's hair, it's hard to imagine it being a point of interest let alone concern, but in terms of how "society" views them it's not a social issue
We are all tax criminals, rich af and spoiled
Stop it please
we're a microstate
A rather small state
Ok, I'll bite (USA/Chicago)
* Great health insurance
* On-site breakfast and lunch
* Unlimited time off
* Gym stipend
* Phone stipend
* Company laptop
* $60k salary
* $10k/year of company stock
Edit: This is not representative of most Americans
My benefits are better than ~95% of the country
Yeah I think unlimited time off is mostly a benefit for the employer since they don't have to pay out when the employee leaves the company
Luxembourg because I'm a dual citizen (US/LU)
Nope, large multinational corp
The major downside is that my work-life balance is wack
I work 50-hr weeks
it's very difficult for me to relax, too
i feel like im constantly at risk of losing my job and going into debt
a health savings account is an account that you can put money into to pay for medical expenses
The money is taken out of your paycheck pre-tax, so you get like a 30% savings by using it
Yeah
I'm planning to move to Europe in the next year or two
I'm just so exhausted at the end of the day
It'll be hard to give up the salary though
I do, but I also have student loan debt
I'm surprised - didn't know it was state to state
I just want to escape the hyper-capitalist culture of my homeland
I'm constantly on edge and feeling like I'm one misstep away from homelessness
Honestly for me the one defining moment in German history would be the unification of Germany in 1871
WW1 and it’s consequences are super important as well imo
That's so specific
What about other kinds of parties
So, like Dinner For One on Sylvester in Germany
Well, with a cold draft you can catch a cold even when it's 40 degrees
Ok so maybe I *don't* wanna work in France
Interestingly, about half of all self-identified Hispanic and Latino people in the US also self-identify as white:
Lol I live in the States
Also I'm very poor
Most museums in Luxembourg city are quite nice but it will depend on your preferences
My personal opinion is that historical museums are the speciality thanks to the casemates of our fortress the history museum Dräi Eechelen and the City museum
In the rest of the country there is our museum for military history in Diekirch, however it is completely about the battle of the bulge and the mining museum in Rumaldange, among others
If you visit with a larger group, I think you can do tours around the fortress of Luxembourg but only with rendez-vous
My most recommended museum is the Musée national d'Histoire et d'Art, a wonderful museum filled with historical artefacts and art
Other art museums include the Villa Vauban for painting from the 17th to the 19th century and the Mudam for contemporary art
The last remaining museum I would recommend is our museum for natural sciences
There is 0 KFC in Luxembourg but quite a few on the borders from other countries
Netherlands
"nice petrol station", at least its something :(
Legalization of marijuana and gay marriage and free public transportation for everyone
I think the news already made the round but in Luxembourg all public transport is free, this includes train, bus and tram
The system was implemented about a year ago on the first of March 2020
Travelling first class still costs you and I think it is priced at 8 or 6 Euro for a day ticket
Before last year it was still incredibly cheap
First, all public transport worked on a unified ticket and there were absolutely no controls in buses anyway, second public transport was free for everyone under the age of 20 already back then
Those that had to actually buy a ticket bought either a two-hour ticket for 2 Euros or a day ticket for 4
If you took a train without ticket, no fine was enforced but you had to buy a ticket at a higher (still laughable) price
I still know that it was a ticket for 5 bucks but can't remember if it was a two-hour ticket or a day ticket
There were also tickets for an entire year and there were carnets with tickets for a week at a reduced price I can't remember
Hello friend
I really don't understand how the DB can commit the atrocious act of being terrible and expensive
I use the Belgian rail every two weeks and I profit greatly from the Go-pass
For 6,90 euro you can travel from any Belgian station to another given you're under the age of 26
A cross a border on my journey raising the price 2 bucks
Buying tickets inside a train also raises the price for about 2 bucks except when the controller is especially friendly
Side note, I'd like to ask a Belgian, how do you perceived the SNCB as my experience with them has been exceptionally well so far
The worst thing about German rail is that it doesn't even get better while getting more expensive
Germany is the bane of transeuropean railway networks but the DB still asks high prices
Is the company completely private or in a government coop
Strange
I regularly pass Liège and it doesn't seem to be that way there even though its among Belgium's largest urban areas
How do you manage to get a government run railway this shitty
Luxembourg's rail is also always late and some trains get cancelled outright but they come at least once per hour, are usually replaceable by bus on its free
I'm not familiar with the SNCF
The only thing I know is that Germany's "high-speed" rail is a joke when you compare it to the TGV without knowing the difference in price
A TGV's top speed is nearly double that of Germany's ICE
If you don't know, you should never privatise rail
The privatisation of rail is among the greatest failures of neoliberalism because competition doesn't work on a railway network were only one train can pass at a time
Privatising infrastructure is pure stupidity
As said, no experience with the French trains
A TGV can go up to 574
8 km/h
The most popular TV channel is RTL (Radio, Telé, Lëtzebuerg)
They’re not necessarily the best but they are pretty good overall
Yeah I'm okay with that, but we want to keep the tax haven status if that's fine with y'all
Desperanto so to say
Our national monument
Belgium
Latvian: 1-10 have unique names, similar to most other European languages
11-19 all say a bit shortened version of "last number over 10". From 20 on: two tens, three tens, etc
21 = two tens one and then the same pattern till 99 = nine tens nine
4x20 wouldn't be too bad, it's confusing as it literally says 4 20 and without enough context no way to know if it's 80 or 4,20
In my home town the old barracks now house asylum seekers
I think in Bastogne they got a nice second live by being refurbished into a history museum
Did not expect that someone names my mother tongue
I'd rather describe Luxembourgish as a Germanic language with a lot of French loanwords (History and all)
The Dutch angle probably has to do with the fact that both languages has the same ancestor
Either way: Glad you like hearing our language
English should be everybody's first language, you can learn and speak your historical language as an academic or cultural practice
Look around the world
It's more important that we are able to communicate well, than that such and such language is preserved as a living language
No joke, we have their mailbox but no single store
Luxembourg has none
But Belgium has one right next to the border with Luxembourg
And in this context, "right next to" can be understood as "Their secondry parking lot can't be square, otherwise it would cross the border"
Luxembourg has Nobel Prize winners
I just googled them and I am amazed by those guys
For Ukraine I'd say probably Lenta za Lentoju (Лента за Лентою) which I think is a patriot song from the second world war though I could be wrong
Most meat we eat is eather beef, pork or chicken, but you can also find other meats like duck, horse or rabbit in supermarkets or on restaurant menus
Not unusual but I would say that rabbit is the least found though

A lot of italian, french and asian restaurants
There are also some American one and Indian
Luxembourg
You're welcome
If it does break up then there will be only England out of EU, the rest may well hurry back in
Yes, but seems the Brexit they voted for was not the same they got
We have our own language in Luxembourg
It draws it’s origin in the old German, so it’s pretty close to what German and Dutch are today, but different enough as well
You’re definitely a troll, the said amount is only the money going out, there is also money coming in as well and then there are other services granted by the EU that make up for it for a large portion
I did partake in this tradition once, though not in Germany but in Luxembourg as that’s where I live
I was surprised to learn of it when I was invited to another luxembourgish Household who does partake as well
Yes most of us speak luxembourgish daily, it’s taught in the early schools years too if a family happens to not know it
Would like to visit
The touristy places seem tempting
Maltese Victory Day combines many great historical victories
But I know a few dozen Maltese people from work
Strangely impolite: they don’t exchange greetings in office corridors although we have talked and know each other by name
I stopped greeting them after a few years meeting them regularly like every week or so
Looks that was acceptable
Damn, you were ready to go with that information
Well formulated by Macron
As others have said already, it's sad that he even has to defend these fundamental values but some people apparently haven't understood what it *means* to be living in a country like France
Good
The data transmission part of the port can evolve with time, but the connector itself can stay forever, like the RJ45 connector for ethernet or the 3

Perfect Brexit Metaphor
A fish rots from the head down
In Luxembourg we had the same problem with the 2015 referendum
One of the three questions asked was if foreigners should have a right to vote
Since we have almost 50% foreigners living in Luxembourg  my thoughts were that this would be a good thing, but the question in the referendum was so stupidly asked (like "should foreigners have the right to vote
"), with no further explanations given what this would mean, that at the end only 21% voted for
One of the goals of the referendum was to get the right to vote for foreigners
And 21% is a shame in my opinion (as a european)
But people were just told, by populist and conservative parties that the foreigners would take something away from them
Funny fact is, that foreigners would only have been able to vote (after a positive referendum) after having lived here for at least ten years
Google luxembourg referendum 2015
Well I guess in the Cities it's like 80% and in rural areas around 30%
Rightly so

I don't remember when was the last time when it snowed this early
Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité!
I got this reference
In Luxembourg all public transportation will be free in March 2020
We are a small country, but it's a good start
Where are all these polls made
I mainly use it to cut my cigars
Ha, joke's on you, Luxembourg-City's river has **two** syllables
Soundtrack : Blood Fire Death by Bathory /m/
Pff, we use *Paräis*. Yep, we added an umlaut in Luxembourgish
On the other hand compromise in a two party system would be stupid beyond belief
Imagine if Biden were to make compromises and take up talking points from Trump
The problem however isn't that compromises are bad but that a two party system is horrible
I favour different viting systems but the French two round system for the presidential election does its job quite well
Proportional voting also works out well
Belgium just went through the worst outcome of a proportional voting system not having a standing government for nearly two years, yet they are doing fine
Just because a system "works" doesn't mean its good
Absolute monarchy works to a certain extent
A two party system is a functional form of governance, however not a particularly democratic one
Limiting a democracy into two options is horrible
Claiming that such a system limits extremism is also bollocks, see Trump's victory
Coalition building fulfills a similar purpose when it comes to the formation of a government while discourse and debate in a parliament are a positive thing and thus even extreme opinions should be allowed to a certain degree if tgey are representative
Having permanent consensus can also be damaging to public discourse
It represents both stability and stagnation
When it comes to America the better of the people also used to exclude an awful lot of the people
Belgium didn't leave the Paris agreement and there were no riots on the street
The system contributes to that problem though

I get the meme, but some of yous don't seem to understand how thoroughly Kanye tarnished his own brand over the last few years, even just through his politics
It's one thing to grab a mic from Taylor Swift, it's another to say "slavery was a choice

> I made the point that China is a more reliable/predictable partner than the US currently
And I think he licked you pretty good in response
China is a dictatorship
Of course it is "reliable" and "stable
" That's what every dictatorship sells itself on
Do you really want the tumult of elections every four years
Or do you want "stability"? The Swiss might call us more reliable if you accept my rule
Let's stop using the word "cancel", nobody knows how to use it and it doesn't apply here
People do remember things
Kanye should actually hope that they do, because he was much more likable in the past both sonically and as a person
The guy is a household name and still got laughed off the stage running for president
He needs a complete rehabilitation of his image and health to even warrant discussion
A well-lit speedbump tbf
Everyone would prefer the Italians, except of course French people

France has like 60 nuclear reactors,but they are old and many of them need renovations

Of course there are haha
I just don't happen to have an accent which is sad
Pssssssssssh ! Tell this no one about this problem
This [one] is much more intersting
That's not true at all
True, but people don't usually go around and confront people with those stereotypes upon meeting them
Lots of people don't think about that
Some don't even know where Luxembourg is exactly but they know it's something with "banks and taxes". Nice to meet you too lol
Thank you for including Luxembourgish !
think you're right, Germany would newer just hang bicycles and leave them on display that's just wasteful
They would melt them and build tanks

Invers for Luxembourg lol
Well China is most likely lying about it
**I think Germany, Austria, BeNeLux and the Northern countries should help the South deal with the virus crisis and the economic crisis which would follow**
Let's discount the effect of artificial economics such as the common market and tariffs from the US/China etc
Europe is so well connected and dense
To ship all those Mercedes, BMWs, Volkswagen
over to the US, China, Japan
that's much more expensive .
This is just one example of many . You want your trading partners to do well
**That said, the whole thing is enraging because the South thinks they are in the right and they are perfect, and the North is evil and bad
As in every system if you tune it down the social hatred towards rich people, they'd do the right thing on spontaneusly
Because it's in their own interest to do so when they project themselves in the future**
**Attacking and shaming rich people and countries would always make them focus on the present and prevent them to focus on the future and do the right thing (for them and for you
and for the EU) , the South should recognize their errors and humbly ask help to the North, having people from Germany and Denmark come over to do courses and form personnel in the Public Administrations, and efficiency in general**
Wait why does CANADA of all places comes third with 8 requests
Dafuq is going on
would be even funnier if OP wasn't an alt-right trumptard
I think he also means countries like the UK, Germany, Poland and France
Feels good to be portuguese
My Hungarian friend said that the size of a parliament is inversely proportional to the strength of a democracy
[Iceland] or [Luxembourg] are probably contenders too
Luxembourg has a Grand-Duke, not a Duke and Guillaume is the Hereditary Grand-Duke
All of them: Prince/Princess
Luxembourg: Duke
Can't piss Luxembourg off eh
"En français (s.v.p.)" or "Is that even a real country/language" for Luxembourg
What, and we are not even mentioned

Wtf are you on about, the ruling was on friday
I know all this
The decision being confirmed by a higher degree of jurisdiction is clearly newsworthy
*cries in Luxembourg*
Luxembourg's just as fucked
What about Luxembourg
Me laughing at this knowing pretty damn well that Luxembourg (my country) already has more infections per 1million residents than italy

That offensive trio is incredible, plus Courtois, Chadli, Mertens etc
This is their year to shock the world, I certainly am rooting for them
I felt Neymar behaved much better this game, which was nice to see

The only difference between liberals and conservatives are the lies they tell you to fuck you over :)
Well i don't really understand why you are upset reading about Trump in a subreddit that talks a lot about politics in general
It reminde me of Corsica strangely

Beautiful city
I did a road trip through Andalusia in 2017 and I absolutely loved it
Granada was one of my favorites
My cousin lives there too haha, still remember when we sometimes snuck in at the park at nights
In Luxembourgish we say: Scheiß, very similar to german
It's "Schäiss
" for us
Merde
Or Schaiss
You sure
Most people I know tend to say "Putain" all the time

lu] says to use the double s instead of the sharp s.
it's just the French word
A true Luxembourger can't spell at all
A true Luxembourger can spell at least 3 languages, none of them their own
Definitely not

As far as I know in my country polls about religion are not allowed
I totally agree muslims are disliked because of their ideology instead of the terrorism
I would find it totally unacceptable for my daughters to be in a relationship with a muslim because of Islam's build-in suppression of women
I also make absolutely sure that my daughters are aware of this
I would even have difficulties trusting atheists with a muslim background for that matter
Any other human (race, gender, ...) would be totally acceptable
Sometimes I need these kinds of posts to assure me that I'm not completely fucked (not yet, anyway) because no one ever seems to mention Europe when it comes to these things
As it is the newest poll it could be a direct reaction to the nomination of Laschet as the Union's candidate for chancellor even though it probably still is of from the current actual average as the shift from older polls is massive
Robert Habeck recently published a book outlining clear criticism towards capitalism and the Greens always had the most overlap with die Linke at least according to both parties' manifestos
I am pretty confident that they would go for G-R-R were they to become largest party after the election
Programmatically they are nearly incompatible with the Union and the Greens could establish themselves as the single center party if the CDU were to actually loose the election by a significant margin, a move not possible within a coalition with them
Not siding with the Union could however also lead to that parties further downfall leaving the Greens without peers
Concerning the Greens willingness to go through with their program, I think that's a thing nobody can tell

Come to the north of our country during summer (outside of Covid times) and you'll see dutch caravans everywhere you look
Well Luxembourg is a pretty popular hub in the middle of europe
Once you get here you will meet people from all over the world just as in the big cities
We actually have a lot of tourists each year
Luxembourg is actually pretty popular for People who want to do a roadtrip through western europe
We have the lowest gaz prices and a very good connection the autobahns of our neighbours
And you can catch a direct train to Paris, Bruxelles, Cologne, Francfort, Nancy and some other cities
Most people you make a stop here in Luxembourg use the time to visit the city or the southern part of the country
But yeah honestly there are better places to visit
Oh an btw the most tourists that come here each year are from the netherlands
They all come camping here, I dont even know why, I mean Luxembourg and the netherlands are pretty similar
The only difference is the language and the fact that we have some tiny mountains
Now honestly why do so fricking many dutch people spend their money for a vacation in Luxembourg  each year
Belgium
No, because Luxembourg is part of Benelux
Kaliningrad isn't part of Eslalit/whatever
I haven't been to Vilnius in a few years, but even as somewhat of a scrooge, I never had a problem finding good bars with cheap beer in the city center
I live in a big American city now and miss those cheap nights out
Finally not landlocked anymore
Though north of Iceland is not really an advantage
I miss when I was that big
The Sierra Nevada looks like a little hill yet it has the highest peak in all of Spain
I'm not surprised that we are behind Germany
But I'm surprised it is not worse
living in Luxembourg is super expensive but I guess it is better than I thought
What's upboat
The worst part is the drivers
How come 100% of people in Belgium are genuinely awful in cars
I do
I just find a lot of bad drivers from Belgium
Maybe just luck

Luxembourg's lowest with 15
7 seems too low
I would think more like 20
We were 13 and I can imagine it's the case in many villages
Pretty much anyone in Europe
As a Belgian my father had a very extensive comic book collection and I read them all
Asterix, Le petit Spirou, Gaston Lagaffe, Tintin, Spirou & Fantasio, Le Scrameustache, Blake & Mortimer, Lucky Luke, Les Schtroumpfs, Boule & Bill, Achille Talon, Buck Danny, Léonard, Chick Bill, Ric Hochet, Yoko Tsuno, Les Tuniques Bleues, XIII, Largo Winch, Les petits hommes and many more
Pretty much my whole childhood revolved around comics
Yeah the machinery was very well drawn, I also loved the multi part story arcs they were great
Why is there data from Lichtenstein but non from Luxembourg
That offends me
What war(s) was Luxembourg involved in and how exactly
Maybe during the yugoslavian wars
*suffocates in British*
If it's free then you're the product
Nobody speaks about the over 10 million Russian people that died in the War
Thats because if it weren\`t Russia everybody would be speaking German,also the Russians and post-Soviet countries are still suffering greatly from the Deaths in the War
They joined the war because Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the US declared War on Japan,and then Germany declared war on the US,even if they didn\`t have too
But the US was more busy with the Pacific War then with Europe
True, USA is one win and one draw vs England in the World Cup
I hate that for foot wear it's always Italy that's used

Wait only three percent of the Brits haven't heard of Luxembourg
Germans could probably beat that number, and we share a border with them
Only 3% didn't hear about us
Hell yeah bois; we're famous
same goes for american english
Same in Luxembourg
That's what their president speaks right
I think A2 comes close
Benelux is the reason why we got so many products including a Dutch description here in Luxembourg
When I was a kid I never understood as nobody here speaks Dutch
It‘s because some of our products are exported to Belgium/Holland as well while others are imported from there
Im glad i live in luxemburg
As long as you can tell it apart from out (correct) flag I'm good
The Luxembourg alternate flag is so much better than our official one :/
And the train link from Brussels to Luxembourg
Silver lining: we were more homogeneous language wise after that
Hi there, compatriot
There’s literally 3 of us on reddit, ha
Now that we’re done with the formalities: That alternate flag is called *Roude Léiw* (red lion), you peasant
Three effing hours
I know but the other nationalities would not have understood that haha
The heat is nice :)
I thought this was new corona cases for a second
A friend of mine and I like to travel to your country (Sweden, for those who don't see the flair) for canoe trips every couple of years
This year should have been our 10 year "anniversary" but Corona had other ideas
It may not seem long ago but even here, we used to have mixed weather on our trips, sunny days, rainy days, and rarely temperatures over 25 degrees
The last two times we went though the temperatures were more often above 25 than they were below and one time we weren't even allowed to make fire (2018) because it hadn't rained in like 2 months
The water level on the lake was well below normal judging by the coastlines, there were way less mosquitos and other nuisances on the bright side but yeah
weird being in Sweden and having south of France weather for weeks at a time
Thanks god for that
Went to the US for a 2 week vacation and got a SIM card there
Got robocalls  probably every other day
Luxembourg has passed that for sure
The Findel is a rather cold spot, so for anyone along the Mosel river, it must have passed the 40 mark
Hey luxembourgish person here, we had above 40° C yesterday , we were at about 40,5°
More like Korrem with a throaty 'r'.
I don't understand some of this
Why go all the way back to proto-indo-european  for English, German, Dutch, etc
But stop at proto-Italic for French, Italian, Spanish, etc
Seems quite arbitrary
