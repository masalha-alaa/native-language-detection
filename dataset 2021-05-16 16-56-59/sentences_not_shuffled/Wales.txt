> The problem for Germany are cases where girls are at risk of having those procedures done by their family once they leave Germany
Yeah, this is an issue in the UK in various communities
High schools now advise girls to [hide a metal spoon in their underwear] if they fear they may be at risk of being taken "home" during school holidays to undergo FGM
Where's England
Gone
reduced to atoms
Fucking bring it

No, not a country
All i heard was;
MURICA, cus FREEDOM
Wales was the first part of the UK to introduce [charges for single-use carrier bags] (2011), and [presumed consent for organ donation] (2015)
Wales introduced a ban on smacking children, so parents can't claim reasonable punishment as a defence for common battery of their children
I think we're behind Scotland on that one though
Did you guys do that thing where people who get a car or motorbike licence are asked if they want to donate their organs
Agreed
I've never given blood (can't because I got a transfusion in the 80s, something to do with BSE
), but that sort of thing is also a good idea
I think you also get asked when you get your driving licence
Nice one
Wow, that's gotta be one of the earliest nations in Europe, surely
Good point
I'm not sure if UK licences do that yet
Don't have a licence myself (my eyesight ruled it out until recently), but I think it's a fairly recent thing, yeah
Wow, that is impressive
Our FM has already called on him to "show maturity
" God help us

Actually, I was going to comment pretty much what you said
In Wales more people are starting to question the benefits of independence, and admittedly there's a mountain to climb but Johnson could get that ball rolling
Ultimately I agree with Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price when he said that the Tories elected a clown
I'm just praying Scotland buys us when they leave the UK
I know Wales voted leave but in our defence a sizeable population are English retirees
Same as you OP - praying it ignites a pro-indy movement here
Whilst also shitting myself, a little
[Unseen footage of Johnson's acceptance speech]
Bittersweet
He is an absolute disaster but I think now at least Scottish independence is inevitable (and hopefully we won't be too far behind)
Rather terrified to be frank
I'd imagine this is gonna be a reimagination of Trump except in the UK
He also looks the part so there's that
> At least in Greece there are signs pointing out that X project was funded in part by the EU
Nothing of the sort in the UK as far as I recall, there's a huge lack of education regarding that
[Signs like that] were *everywhere* [here in Wales] Despite the EU funding large parts of our infrastructure, 52
5% of people who voted to Leave looked at that and said "[nah, we don't need that]
In my mind, yes
In reality
no comment
Nah she's an authoritarian hag
Cough Rory cough
One of my favourite historical anecdotes is the unintional Scottish use of biological warfare in the 1745 jacobite uprising
They brought cows with them from scotland who it's heavily suspected were infected with some disease or other I can't remember
The scottish army penetrated as far south as roughly derby, and strangely the cow populations along this trail came down with the disease as well with the disease spreading as low as derby
Definetly sounded better when I read it than this sounded but hey ho
Not necessarily unemployed, could be a minimum wage worker
Reliance on food banks to feed their kids, skipping meals to save money, avoiding using the heating/electric, no internet, renting (potentially council housing)
According to a study in 2015, 21
6% of people here are in relative poverty
This is poverty where you have a low income relative to others
I’m not quite sure how this is calculated, as surely people would always be in relative poverty, unless there’s a qualifier of 20% less than median or something
There must be a qualifier of sorts because it goes on to talk about how people can’t afford to feed their kids and eat, afford products like shampoo and food etc
There’s a figure going around than almost 1 in 5 children here suffer from food insecurity
Which is when healthy nutritious food for each day is not guaranteed
This poverty, both abject and relative, has huge knock on effects
Someone in relative poverty will end up socially excluded, which mean they will be up to 10 times more likely to die early
These children are also growing up, not knowing when they’ll next eat a hot meal, not having any (or many) toys, missing out on sports, clubs and even school
For sure, since I finished school I haven't had many chances to speak my native language
Long periods of time of speaking nothing but english has left my Welsh vocabulary noticeably lacking compared to a few years ago
Don't really count since english is my first language, but I love it when people have strong accents over english
I especially like dutch accents, but tbh any accent is a lot more personal than learning to speak with a perfect accent
My accent is a bit odd, nobody ever guesses correctly (I've had everything from West Country to Norfolk), the only place nobody ever guesses is Wales
I wish I had a bit of a Welsh Valleys accent and didn't sound as English as I do
I don't really know what my accent actually is, it sounds English but isn't posh, its got a subtle Welsh twang but not enough that it sounds Welsh
IDEK
This has been one of the few Reddit threads I've seen which has genuinely blown my mind
I had no idea Europeans were so self conscious about their accents
As Brit who only speaks English (as is tradition) I don't think I've ever thought anything negative about the accent of anyone speaking English
I think my accent is ok
It could be better but it could also be worse, I think it's rather neutral
Regarding others' accents, I don't mind many foreign accents
The American accent can annoy me sometimes (personally I find it really unnatural, it sounds made up)
I don't like a lot of the British accents, they're just too thick and difficult to understand
Its also a problem for a UK person learning Spanish (me) the LL and J is easy because I grew up in Wales and that has similar sounds, buit rolling R's lol I could live for 300 years and still not do it (god I have tried)
'fierce dull' - what a great expression
I know it's probably not representative of most Germans, but I can listen to Sebastian Vettel speaking English all day
I was told my Rs in Spanish are quite good
I think it’s probably from learning a Welsh from a young age which has a lot of rolled Rs
Frustrated my friend who studies a Spanish degree though as she had to spend years getting it right
Android are just more realable and I phones are known for breaking
Wait so in canada I phones dint easily break
Have they fixed the accent yet
We're the guy that doesn't get involved in much of anything - sitting out of things like gift exchanges and office drama
We have a very niche job, and do it well, but we don't really get involved with other people
It's also probably our job to fix the water cooler whenever it's broken
Macsen and Geraint come from Maximillian and Gerontius from back when we had those Romans over
I believe that Idris and Cerys date back even further to Phoenician traders
Lots of Welsh names seem pretty timeless but I've never met a young Blodwen
As someone who speaks quite decent German, if I'm speaking German but theres an English word mid-sentence I almost always mispronounce the English word
Wales has more castles per square mile than any other country on Earth
Wales has 4x more sheep than people, the second largest sheep: person ratio in the world after New Zealand
The longest place name in Europe (and second longest in the World) is Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, which is on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales
The Welsh national anthem was the first national anthem to ever be sung before an international sporting fixture, when the Welsh rugby team sang it in response to New Zealand's haka in 1905
The patron saint of Ireland, St
Patrick, was actually Welsh and was taken to Ireland as a slave
I've met Finnish people in the UK and can vouch for 2
> The longest place name in Europe (and second longest in the World) is Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, which is on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales
It's also the longest [railway station name] in Europe, IIRC
Ironically the [station has had to be closed] as the platforms are too short for social distancing
Thanks for the contact lenses, with my prescription I really need them
I'm assuming the Welsh sheep stat is compared to countries rather than territories
Oddly the same is said here too
Way back in the early 00s this was a pretty big topic here in the uk
Nope
It's spread across the entirety of Europe and the West at this point, maybe even further
Have you seen today's example of "Leopards ate MY face

Went I to party yesterday and saw I three men big walking towards my friend
Ran
Not problem my is it
(I do mainly speaking Welsh “iaith llafar” so sorry to the other Cymry if my grammar’s off)
I've gotta be honest, probably not because Wales haven't been since the 1950's. I'd be happy if there were more joint efforts, and I'm still against the world cup being in Qatar
While not technically a politician, one of the chief science advisor to the government, a guy who was heavily responsible for imposing lockdown on us, resigned
For being caught breaking lockdown
To have an adulterous shag
* In 1993, the Secretary of State for Wales, John Redwood, was captured on cameras making a [right mess] of singing the Welsh national anthem
* Alun Cairns (a more recent holder of the Welsh Secretary's office), campaigned for the relatively pointless renaming of the Second Severn Crossing [in honour of Prince Charles] a man who is not exactly universally popular in Wales
* Alun Cairns later had to resign as Welsh Secretary after a former aide of his [caused the collapse of a rape trial]
* A few weeks ago, the Welsh Government's Health Minister was forced to apologise after being [caught swearing during a Zoom meeting]
Welsh assembly hasnt had anything like that
yet have they
Sheep cull
Urdd have called off the Youth Eisteddfod and closed their residential camps (Glan-llyn, Llangrannog etc)
I think that's a victory to the 'black nun' then
Yes, rarely a day goes by where there isn't a "save the children of * insert African nation * from dirty water" advert
I was told once by a former CEO of a charity that most of the help and donations that are given to African countries creates more problems than they purport to solve
For example, all the clothing that was donated during Live Aid and since have completely decimated the local textile and clothing industries due to the abundance of cheaper donated clothes
&#x200B;
I also remember around the early 90s having appeals (mostly in schools) to send aid packages to the former eastern block Balkan countries for the same purpose
As a native English speaker the words synecdoche and hyperbole were very strange to me
I suppose it’s because they aren’t spelt as they would be if they were originally from English, but I still remember them as hyper-bowl and se-neck-douche
The offensive word for Spanish people that I was told is “spik”. Though I’ve never really heard anyone use it, but would recommend avoiding it anyway
Hopefully it’s just dying out as a word because no one wants to use it

We did it in school for GCSE English, don’t think I ever used it really
Certainly isn’t common
I remember apropos because when I first heard it I thought someone was having fun abbreviating the word appropriate, so now when I’m trying to remember it that series of event comes to mind
Yeah, I just remember it wrongly in order to remember it correctly if that makes any sense
I've never received one in the mail, I've always picked one up whenever I visited any of their stores though
I can understand the sadness Swedes feel about this decision - us Brits had the same when [Argos announced they were discontinuing their catalogues] earlier this year
Yup, I did that too
[Here's the video
Sadly, yes
Sadly it's true - I think they're going to keep doing a mini Xmas catalogue like they've got this year, though
Yes and no
Amongst older generations, the baby boomers  yeah there probably is, the younger down the demographics you go though it tends to disappear though
Honestly though it depends what you mean by anti German sentiment
And I would say it's definitely less then you'd find amongst the English
Any time there is a England vs Germany football match boy does it ramp up
I don't think it is
The only people I can recall saying anything remotely anti-german are conspiracy theorists and nationalists who are obsessed with the war
I don't think most people care
Not all the elderly, some of them were on the side of the Nazi
That's true, I suppose,  if you on the eurosceptic side of things you ain't gonna love the germans
Plus especially in Englands case when it Co
Es to the football England fans ain't too fond of Germans either
Can I just say re: the UK , most of us , like 99
9% never even think about Serbia and could not find you on a map
Croatia on the other hand is lovely
I have heard that they (ze Germans) stare a lot and the women force the men to pee sitting down
As a free British person we are told from birth that "it's rude to stare" and nobody will force  me to pee sitting down
And people say Germans lack hunour
And the English are a bunch of Morris dancing cunts :)
We just like war because we never lose, it's nothing personal, go back to squatting and smoking cigarettes, it will relax you
I will put it on my reading list
Sounds hilarious
TBH if I was unlucky enough to be an eastern European I would be a bit salty about B Liar
So this is why the reputation for staring
So basically you pee like a girl
Maybe the British telling the world, through media , that Germans have no sense of humour, has caught on
Hmm we are taught in the UK that it's rude to stare, it's like inviting somebody to fight you
Is the men being made to pee sitting down a real thing as well
I always thought Spar was from America (specifically New England due to the tree and the colour scheme)
Should have called it after the equivalent offence: *Taken Without Owner's Consent*
I sure do love to play *Motor Vehicle Theft*
There's nothing quite like it
It's called Penneys in Ireland, IIRC
Opel was bought by GM, not GE
They've now sold Opel (and Vauxhall) to PSA of France
It is German - IIRC it's a shortened form of "Albrect Discount", named after the founder
So does that weird you guys out if you come to the UK and see Primark
Like how it's TK Maxx here but TJ Maxx in the USA
I'm going to have to look for pictures of Penneys branches now, I imagine they are identical apart from the name
Scotland perhaps
It's perfectly safe to drink the tap water in Wales
The water here in North Wales is particularly good - to the point that rural villages were even bulldozed to enable the construction of new reservoirs to serve cities in Northwest England
I’m from North Wales and I agree, I guess if I was in London or something I’d buy bottled water tbh
>In absolutely every TV show in the UK that takes place in Spain (and there are many) they insist on playing flamenco sounding music even when the show is about Catalonia, Galicia or The Basque Country,
Tbh they do that with every country, even the ones that are part of the UK
If its set in North Wales you can guarantee everyone would have a (South Wales) valleys accent, there would be male voice choir singing (again largely part of South Welsh culture) and there would definitely be a shot of a sheep on a hillside
You mean bacalhau (I don’t know if I’m spelling that right) or just cod in general
Welsh lockdown rules only make the UK wide news when they're controversial
> I've noticed it's often misspelt as Whales
I suspect that's a consequence of autocorrect assuming they really do mean to type "Whales"
Someone in my school let off a stink bomb in the head teachers car (no idea how they managed it) but that was the only exciting thing that ever happened (apart from students shagging in the toilets but thats standard)
I'm not sure there's been an example of Welsh in a film or TV show at all, let alone a decent attempt
I love Bruhl, his English is literally perfect too
To be fair a lot of people hiking in wales are people that aren't welsh and haven't hiked before
Can you literally not just do that at home over a nice cup of tea though
I’ve never heard the phrase “to go Dutch” before
The English sometimes say " don't Welsh on a bet" meaning don't try and get out of paying a bet, but the correct term is "Welch"
So it's a bit like saying "don't make me your escape goat" or " you keep me hanging on tender hooks" basically stupid shit that stupid people say
Outside of YouTube videos I’ve only really encountered this in person once
I’m pretty comfortable with most Welsh accents (not shocking), my Dad is Irish so I’m used to him and his families accents
I’ve got a northern English flatmate and feel pretty comfortable with those accents
Scottish is on tv a lot and I’ve read Trainspotting so I recognise some of the unique words (ken, keks, bairn, greetin)
I spent a lot of time in the South West of England growing up, and yet in a pub in Bristol around a year ago, there was a old guy with the most incomprehensible Somerset/Bristol accent
I’d never encountered an accent so strong and I felt so rude not understanding him
It didn’t help that it was busy and he was mumbling anyway but I don’t think I understood at all what he said
Perhaps it was an older accent because [this sort of] Bristol accent, with the ‘l part, I’ve never really heard in person
Either way, was uncomfortable for me since I generally think I’m quite good at understanding accents
Went to Pete's Eats in Llanberis when I went up to visit my mate, living in south Wales conversational Welsh is rare as rocking horse shit
I understood a bit from Duolingo, but no where nesa enough to hold a decent conversation
I suppose we get told that we would starve in the streets
Wales isn’t a collection of tiny islands over a bridge
We were kids (like 11) and she had either moved to the school or was visiting somehow, and because she came over the Severn bridge and came down along the coast she was convinced Wales was hundreds of tiny close together islands
Unfortunately it's kind of waning
There was a road sign in Swansea that [went viral] about 10 years ago
>Unfortunately, the e-mail response to Swansea council said in Welsh: "I am not in the office at the moment
Send any work to be translated".
> So that was what went up under the English version which barred lorries from a road near a supermarket
Yeah, that always struck me as odd
Plus, how did *nobody* on the council spot "swyddfa" in the reply (office) given it would also be on the signage of every post office in the city
No-one only speaks Welsh these days, but there are many who would only learn English in school and speak none at home
Not really - there are people who have Welsh as their first language, but they learn English in school too
I've been to Budapest, fortunately I went in December so it wasn't as full of idiots as I imagine it is at other times
I was embarrassed seeing some of the other Brits (and other nationalities) there who were only looking for cheap alcohol and a shag
We did partake in the cheap alcohol but we also tried to sample some local culture and made sure to learn just a few words and phrases (its really not difficult to learn basic words like Köszönöm)
I've also been to Amsterdam too but wasn't there for as long as I was in Budapest so didn't sample as much of the local culture but still managed a bit (to this day I'm still addicted to Stroopwafels)
We did try out the coffee shops but to be fair only did that on one of the evenings we were there
Two of our group wanted to just spent all day in there while the rest of us (who hadn't been before) wanted to see more of the city
Both are absolutely fantastic cities that I would gladly revisit
I'm usually embarrassed by the Brits I see abroad
Many make absolutely no effort to engage with the local culture and be respectful of the locals (thats a problem with UK tourists in Wales let alone abroad)
I loved Budapest, its a gorgeous city (possibly the prettiest I've been to)
Unfortunately the only way to stop that type of tourism is to make it expensive
Either way köszönöm for your fantastic hospitality
You've got a lovely capital, don't let our knobheads ruin it
It was funny when I went I expected it to be full of UK knobheads looking for coffee shops and the red light district
In reality Germany were playing the Netherlands that weekend (and lost) so it was full of Germans (which as a German speaker who was living in Germany at the time was funny)
I must say though I went to Nijmegen (and Arnhem) to see the bridges from Operation Market Garden and was blown away by how lovely it was
I lived about an hour away from the Dutch-German border so visited a handful of times and really fell in love with the place
Looking forward to visiting again in the future
When I went almost everyone in the party district was UK/ German
20°C today, far more manageable
Last few days have been absolute hell though
There is a saying that to be born Welsh, is to be privileged,  not with a silver spoon in your mouth, but with music in your heart and poetry in your soul
Or if you’re in the South, with a rugby ball in hand lol
Whenever a new baby is born someone always says “he’ll be a rugby player” or “he’ll never be a rugby player”, purely based on the size of the baby
And often describe the middle classes as "people who buy their own furniture"
Although it's a town, [Port Talbot] is the clear winner for Wales
Elevated motorway, identikit terraced housing, huge steelworks just outside the town
Definitely Port Talbot
Steelworks and other industry dominates the landscape and it's not pretty
Ahhh Port Toilet
I thought about putting in a bid for Swansea but go you
Many years ago I visited Krakov
The guide books said not to bother with Nowa Huta as it was an ugly steel town
I like to ride the tram lines on holiday so naturally went there - and it's beautiful
Hahahaha yeah
That takes me back to playing Sim City 2000
*fuck, the city's bankrupt
clicks on **Disasters > Earthquake** menu
I doubt there was much planning going on
I try not to slag off places but I struggled to find any redeeming features on Google Street view
Same
You certainly don't forget the smell
Once driven past, never forgotten
Ah, I've only passed the place on the M4
It stinks if the steelworks is operating
Looks cool at night though
Swansea had a fair bit of regeneration in the last decade, mainly down the waterfront
Not as much as Cardiff but it's a start
I find a lot of guide books are like that - I've read a few things the night before we fly out somewhere, and thought "what the fuck have we booked
Get there the next day and after the second day I love the place
It's like they wrote the guide 25 years ago and never updated it
Yeah, it's not ideal, I don't think there were many other options for building it though
If the steelworks is operating the area stinks, I know what you mean though
Places like Port Talbot and the Stanlow refinery near Ellesmere Port in England do look kinda cool at night
The landscape and coastline can help to forget the ugly buildings around here
There are some amazing walks and bike rides around Port Talbot
I suspect that guide book writers don't like the same stuff I do - guide books are still great to find some nice places though
Cardiff is running out of sites to redevelop to the extent that they built on the bus station, the rest of Wales not so much
Lack of mental healthcare and bad social safety nets
Someone's never been to the UK
I was in an airbnb in Paris, and it turned out the dude was just renting out his bedroom to us, and living in the adjoining living room
A little bit more personal than we wanted but that’s fine
He also was using either the toilet in ‘our’ bedroom or another flats
Anyway, we just decide to spend the large majority of our time out of the room
After the second day, we get in to see a note on the bed complaining about how we left his room a mess, and all of our clothes neatly placed on radiators and in our bags
Now, to be fair we had left the room in a bit of a mess
But it was our private room, according to the description
Clothes left about the room is hardly extreme, and we were leaving the next day
Made us feel very uncomfortable and we were glad to get away, especially before he did/said something else
Not really holiday because I was living in Germany at the time but I was on a train in Goslar in Central Germany and this guy comes and sits next to me smiling
I gave him the nod of acknowledgement but didn't say anything but after a few minutes he started talking to me, fortunately my German is okay so I was able to keep up with him but he had a really weird accent
Anyway he thought I was his colleague and didn't believe me when I told him that I wasn't, at one point he even told me to stop doing that stupid accent because I sounded like a "Spasti". After that I pretended that it was my stop and moved to the other end of the train
Was on holiday in france, visiting the american landing grounds, and when we where in sainte mere eglise a italian couple in a french hire car reversed back and hit us and dented our car, now not so strange but, they spoke to us in fluent english and the man even spoke to me in welsh for some of it
Weird times
I think they have, in general, gotten a little better over time
It sometimes felt like some people took it as they had a new housemate rather than a stranger who is there for a holiday or work
I remember a host in Bourges treating me and my girlfriend at the time like 2 of her children, feeding us, driving us around
Was lovely but slightly overbearing
Had to give her a top review though, since we wouldn't have been able to get our bus out of the city without her
Well, I was a naive 18 year old and on a long summer trip, so I think I gave the host too much credit in the review, though I definitely mentioned his invasion of privacy
Well, out of more than 15 Airbnbs, that's the worst I've had
Another contender would be a private room in Lyon, where it was just a mattress on the floor, with a bunch of laundry in the room, but that was clear from the booking
There were some strange individuals in the living room at times, and a shopping trolley on the balcony, but again, was a cheap room and nothing bad happened
All other Airbnbs have been from okay to brilliant, including a full apartment in Munich with a sauna that was incredibly cheap
Should say, another weird experience was our taxi driver from the train station to this building in Lyon accidentally came to the end of the one way street from the wrong side
So he just shrugged and reversed down it, as if that means he's obeying the one way signs, was quite funny
I'm not an expert in Airbnb by any means
All I meant was nowadays it's less likely you'll end up in a guys living room with a cat that won't stop licking you or something else stupid and unadvertised
If you want to rent a decent room in a city, Airbnb can often be a good idea
Does it matter than the company has moved into a different part of the market
You can still do "couchsurfing with money" with other sites
This is true
I fully support cities and countries creating laws to specifically curtail this sort of business, or tax correctly at least
Parts of Wales had and still have a similar problem where people buy 2nd homes and then they are vacant throughout the winter months
Some villages with up to 70% of the homes being not regular homes
While Airbnb turns a somewhat blind-eye to this buying-to-rent on their website, cities still have the power to mitigate and change the effects around these prices
There are also still plenty of listings on Airbnb that are private rooms or apartments people have traveled away from for a while
Of the ones I have visited, 11 of 15 have been that
The ones that weren't what Airbnb was orignally supposed to be were a very hotel style apartment in Venice, one was a large flat in central Berlin, that would've been for maybe one or two people as a residence but was rented out as a 7 bedroom property and the rest were the classic airbnb apartments that have been discussed
I can't vouch for how good these are as I haven't use them, but google gives the literal "couchsurfing" app, as well as ones called "HomeStay", "HomeAway" and "Tripping". Additionally, if you pick an Airbnb that is clearly a spare room or lived in flat, then you aren't damaging the city in the way a specifically "Airbnb" flat might
Picture 2 looks 'familiar', I think I've been there - is it Orta San Giulio
Have you ever been out on a NYE
This is quiet if anything, it’s just the near renaissance position of the bloke with the pint
It’s of course a tongue in cheek thing but Britain is notorious for this behaviour
North Wales
Largely forgotten and cut off from the rest of Wales (have to travel to England 1st if going to South Wales via public transport)
And to top it all off theyre being invaded by scousers
Poor gogs
I'd say we're largely forgotten by Cardiff Bay, yeah
The seaside resorts and castles along the coast do still attract holidaymakers from England, particularly Merseyside
Honestly though I'd answer "The Valleys" to the OP's question, the economy of the area was ruined when the likes of the coal mines and steel works all closed down
The Welsh Government publish a data set called the Index of Multiple Deprivation
It’s ranks small clusters of 1,500 people by factors such as health, education, housing conditions
Rhyl is bottom on just about every metric
I mean, Wales as a whole isn’t doing great compared to the rest of the UK
So to be bottom of that table shows just how bad it is there
On the plus side you can’t get a nice 3 bed new build for like £110k. With the rise of remote working i do wonder if those towns might be a bit more attractive
Who am I kidding, Rhyl is beyond hope
>And to top it all off theyre being invaded by scousers
Poor gogs
I wouldn't worry too much
Just make a tin foil Premier league trophy for those bin dippers
Let em think they stole it off us and then theyll leave ya alone
Scousers have a simple mind
They are like magpies, they See something shiny then they just gotta nick it
I live in the valleys so was trying to avoid saying that ;)
Its unfortunate that areas with low populations get completely forgotten all over the UK
Transport for me would be the biggest possiblity for change
Reopening the Carmarthen to Aberystwyth railway would be a huge step in the right direction, trains could run directly from Pwllheli to Cardiff then
[careful what you wish for]
Yup, fully agreed on the transport
Apologies for bringing The Valleys back up, but it is the clearest example for me
A lot of people don’t know about [Owain Glyndwr ] and his war for Welsh independence in the 1400s. Ultimately it was unsuccessful, but it’s a very cool story
Wales was never brought into the U.K. willingly, even Scotland at least had a shared monarch and some papers were signed
Wales was a conquest
At the time there were separate laws for Welsh and English people
Welsh people were 2nd class citizens
Glyndwr managed to control the whole country independently of  English rule for around 2 years, being recognised by both the Scottish and French crowns at the time
Eventually it was ended but he disappeared from the castle they were sieging at the end
Now there’s a myth that if Wales is ever in danger again he will emerge from somewhere
I remember reading somewhere last year that a lot of people, even in the wider UK, were only just learning about the [Aberfan Disaster] because it featured prominently in Series 3 of the Netflix series *The Crown*.
Yeah, it's over 50 years ago now, but it's a shame that it doesn't seem to be taught in schools across the UK
IIRC it was mentioned to us *once* in prmary school
Well contrary to the other commenters
I thought I’d say that I had never heard of this before, so thanks
Merched Beca
I suppose modern context is hard to get across now there are no coal mines - but we can all relate to the "school full of children buried alive" part, surely
Indeed - I wasn't suggesting you wouldn't empathise with them or anything
I vaguely remember it was mentioned *once* when I was in school, in terms of how quick we'd done a fire drill or something
So not even in history class
Yup, but honestly there's so much UK history past about the end of WWII that I just sort of learned about once I'd finished school, you  know
Funnily enough this sort of discussion has come up in a few UK subreddits now, given all the protests in the USA and some of the UK's own BAME / Empire issues
Maybe looking back to all the Tudors, Romans, Celts etc needs to be 'paused' for a while
It should be
No one likes it
Don’t do it
This might sound cruel, and I love cats, but I don’t think you do the animal any good by feeding it on the street where it can breed and create more stray cats
Better to turn it into a shelter or catch/neuter/release
This one is strange to me
I’ve been going to the cinema by myself for years
What’s the point of going with friends, they either talk and ruin the film or you can’t interact with them because of the film
But then again, I usually go to the cinema 1-2 times per week, because I am a film critic
I like going alone but find it very different to watching at home because the picture quality and atmosphere is superior
The letter “LL/ll” and the sound it makes
Linguistically it is a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative
[This video ] shows how it sounds
I believe this sound is similar to one in the Trondheim dialect of Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroese and Greenlandic
It’s also in a lot of Native American and Caucasian languages, but in terms of Europe and where Welsh is spoken it’s a pretty unique sound
I’ve seen it compared to the Welsh “hiraeth” too but I believe the Welsh can be more specifically a place
Welsh has the word “hiraeth” which means pretty much the same thing :)
> we don’t technically have words for “yes” and “no”
Same in Welsh
Just move the time by 30 minutes and be done with the whole damn charade
Many Huguenots also came to the U.K. where they developed a silk-weaving industry
People liked French stuff at the time, so they also worked as French tutors, and people went to their church choirs to learn French too
In London, there’s a house (Dennis Severs house) in Shoreditch where most of the rooms are displayed as if being used by a family of Huguenots from the early 18th century to the early 20th century
The room at the top stinks of urine, for example, because that was used in the silk-weaving process
Many famous people in the U.K. are of Huguenot descent, such as Farage
Such an interesting history
They came in the 16th century and also after 1680
However people were much less friendly to German refugees from 1708-10 because they weren’t usually skilled workers, and they were encouraged to move onto the American colonies
Probably Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch for Wales
It's a small town with a really long name, which was basically made up to attract tourists
The highlights are taking a photo of [the sign] at the [railway station] and going to the sort of [gift shop] there, which sells the usual sort of [generic Welsh themed stuff]
I feel like explaining its made up, but contains actual Welsh words and has a very long translation
Someone didn't just mash the typewriter one day
I don't think the Waitrose was a thing when I visited in the`1990s! If I was passing I'd probably drop in again, but that's what the coach tours tend to do anyway
Yeah, the other problem is that station is a 'request stop', many trains just fly through at like 70 mph normally :P
Most tour groups arrive by bus
Good point, I should have mentioned that because the whole 'someone mashed a typewriter' 'joke' pisses me off, yeah
Yes, I remember being surprised at the size of the shop when I visited
If it was a local train, the crews will look for people waving the train down
Or someone on the train wanted to get off there :P
Ah but do you surstromming
I second the last point
Quite a bit then fair play
If you go through the Channel Tunnel, the music changes to the first couple lines of God Save The Queen and you somehow emerge in the middle of Westminster Bridge
The Valleys
I mean, [just look at it]
basically any non-welsh show with welsh characters in it
Imagine thinking arianism has anything to do with race lol
Ah yes the 4th reich theory
I don't think I've met anyone who seriously believes that one
Its just something to say to get the Germans upset
You certain
Sounds incredibly cynical that to me tbh
I didn't think *anyone* handwrites 'a'? I thought it was just a printing typeface thing
Technically wouldn't it be the citizens of the city of Rome who'd wanna retake constantinople
Surely you Greeks would wanna retake Iran
Only if you lot are subordinate to us Welsh
With the seat of power residing in Cardiff
Why stop there
Let's take the entirety of Europe and set up a united kingdoms of Europe
Cornwall and Wales both (sadly) voted for Brexit
Pretty decidedly
If you go you'd have to hand back the Premier league
I'm sure that would make an awful lot of mancs happy
Driving age: 16
Join the Army/ buy a gun: 18
Buy a beer: 21
Wtf
Yeah I remember when I was 16 me and my friends used to joke about this "legally we can have sex but can't watch videos of sex".
Consuming too much alcohol is bad for you no matter how old you are
What's at question here is at what age do we consider people capable of making informed and responsible decisions about their lifestyles and health
This site looks a bit basic, but has a table comparing the US and UK school systems, particularly the way the year groups match up
We had a Welsh flag outside our school too
I’m trying to remember if I saw any outside others but can’t remember
Definitely more common in Ireland, though I see a lot of Welsh flags here
I know a house around the corner with one on a pole, and even the nearby industrial estate has a Welsh, St David’s and I believe sometimes an Irish and Scottish flag
IIRC British pints are larger than American ones :P
I have been told it would be relatively easy for the UK to convert things like our road signs to metric - apparently a lot of the road signs are placed at metric intervals, but still say '1/2 mile' or similar
Yup, I'm in the same boat
Taught mm, cm and metres at school
I can convert *some* measurements between things like MPH and Km/h, but that's mainly down to things like watching a lot of F1 and having an interest in railways
The last time I was in hospital, I had a pre-operative assessment where they gave me my height in cm and weight in kg
I had to ask for the measurements in feet and inches, and stones
When Wales play in the rugby everybody takes the day off
Not legally but everyone is "sick" ;)
>Saturday sauna
Peak Finland
Every service job I’ve worked has done this
Everyone just shrugs their shoulders and gets on with it
It’s stupid
The two owners would also split the tip with themselves too
Thing is you lose respect for the workplace then
I regularly gave out free drinks and took ones for myself in the end because I knew exactly where the cameras were and I didn’t care about the business
If they’d actually treated us with some respect I would’ve done the same back
Lol also means something in Welsh
Not 100% on the correct translation but I think it would be something like silliness
We get the double whammy of being overwhelmed domestically by our neighbours in England and being overwhelmed internationally by the US
Over the last 3 years, it's become [increasingly clear] that one of the few ways to find news from Wales is to watch the evening news on BBC Wales - ie the 30 minute 'local' news after the main evening news bulletin
Major stories from Wales barely seem to feature on the 'national' news in the UK
It led to a ridiculous situation where before covid most people in Wales didn't know who the first minister was or what the Welsh Government actually did
I believe one poll showed that most people thought the UK Government ran education and healthcare in Wales
I think the Netherlands maybe
On paper id say Finland or Sweden but I've read that people are more reserved on talking to strangers so I might get a bit lonely
Below 10 I'll wear a thin jacket, below 5 I'll wear a good warm jacket
Anything above 15 is barbecue weather
I don't think of three words, more so a map (with the isles featuring a bit more prominently) and a few feelings
But if I were to describe those feelongs in three words it would probably be: Home, Pride, Serenity
It’s a bit annoying when you wake up and go to work or uni in the dark and then get home and it’s dark again, but also, I don’t really need it to be light
You just do more inside activities like board games and video games, go to the cinema and the pub, watch fireworks and drink more hot drinks
I’ve never really had a problem with it being dark
As other people have said, it does sound like you may have seasonal depression, as the feelings about the dark seem to be quite powerful, whereas for me it doesn’t really cross my mind except to answer things like this
Winter is always a bit depressing, but I guess we're just used to it to an extent
The football/ rugby being on gives me something to look forward to, and I tend to spend more time in the pub during the winter than the summer so I guess thats how I cope haha
Sometimes a night time walk is nice, the cold crisp air seems fresher than it does in summer, and if you live near to a city then seeing the lights in the distance is quite beautiful
When its wet and horrible then theres nothing better than snuggling up on the sofa with a cup of hot chocolate to watch a film
Personally, I've voted for Plaid Cymru in full belief
Whilst they are a bit controversial here in Wales because of their desire for Welsh Independence, it does seem that they truly want what is best for Wales as opposed to ohter parties which almost just see having a  majority in the Senedd as a way to solidify votes in the UK general elections
I'm not fully decided on whether I fully support independence, but it's hard to deny that Plaid's policies and ideas have Welsh people's interests in mind - for example, a railway connecting the North and South as there are currently no real transport links outside of single-~~lane~~ carriageway roads or England
"Single-carriageway" roads, surely
Otherwise, yeah
Plaid are appealing more and more to me recently
The "problem" I have is that a) my constituency is generally a safe Labour seat for both Westminster and the Senedd, and b) our local MP and AM are decent chaps who speak up on behalf of the area
Plaid would feel like a bit of a 'wasted vote' in some ways, sadly
That's what I meant, yeah, apologies
My constituency is very safe conservative, and yes Plaid is almost a wasted vote for me too
But if everybody adopted that attitude, then no steps will be made towards the party's progress in that constituency
I consider it worth voting anyway and especially spreading awareness of Plaid's policies - I've found a lot of people in my area aren't too sure what they're all about so it's worth introducing them
Hey, no worries - it still makes getting north to south a pain in the arse
I agree on your second paragraph, too
As others have said Plaid need people to stop seeing them as some kind of party for rural folk and Welsh speakers
EDIT: I do think they need more media coverage outside of Wales too
That's very true
Personally I think Adam Price's appearances in the TV debates last year did a lot for their popularity, he is a very likeable party leader
I'd say Leanne Wood before him was similar, too
She always came across well in debates
I had a British passport thanks to my dad so I moved out of sheer boredom to his hometown
Been in Wales for 3 years now
Sadly no
People who say Wales is part of England lol
The only thing that is worse is when people jump or push in to a queue
That is tantamount to heresy here
This I can understand, sure there is some cultural crossover between us but I could definitely see why that misunderstanding could easely get on your tits
Oh fuck yes
This is a biggie
So damn annoying
I mean it is isn't it
Anything that was behind the iron curtain during the cold War is technically Eastern Europe
Right
It is a geographic fact though
Its called the British Isles because the largest island in the chain is called Britain and that naming convention has been around since the days of ancient Greece, their name for our Isles was the Prettanikē Isles
That's where we get the name britanic from and which has evolved into British
Lmfao, not quite
The UN would disagree
They class Poland as an Eastern European nation
No, but the common perception is that Poland is an Eastern European nation
You joined the EU with a bunch of other Eastern European States on the 1st of May 2004
So yeah perception is that Poland is a Eastern European state
I'd imagine the naming convention only really applies to island groups/chains and not peninsulas so there is that
Honestly I don't see why it winds you lads up so much, it's only a name, you have your own language so come up with a new name for the british Isles in Irish or something
Problem solved
>Ancient Greek is a bit of a reach
The earliest know reference to the “British Isles” is by John Dee, a propagandist and advisor to Elizabeth I. It was most definitely a political term,
Yet I have info that would say otherwise
" "Britain" comes from Latin: Britannia~Brittania, via Old French Bretaigne and Middle English Breteyne, possibly influenced by Old English Bryten(lond), probably also from Latin Brittania, ultimately an adaptation of the Common Brittonic name for the island, *Pritanī.[1][2]
An early written reference to the British Isles may derive from the works of the Greek explorer Pytheas of Massalia; later Greek writers such as Diodorus of Sicily and Strabo who quote Pytheas' use of variants such as Πρεττανική (Prettanikē), "The Britannic [land, island]", and nēsoi brettaniai, "Britannic islands", with *Pretani being a Celtic word that might mean "the painted ones" or "the tattooed folk", referring to body decoration "
From :
So the term British Isles goes much further back then Elizabethen times and stretched back into classical antiquity
It most definitely is not a political phrase, no matter how you'd like to frame it otherwise
No disputing Czechia but then they have had a bit of a rebranding I suppose
Still to most western European people I'd argue that Poland is still seen as  an Eastern European nation
Lol fair one  nice turn around there
Seriously though the whole Atlantic achepelego/ North atlantic Isles, Anglo celt lsles phrase  doesn't roll off the tounge quite as well as British Isles
For the sake of expedencey the name British Isles should stay
And yet you still use the English language for that
If ya gonna use English, then use the English name for these islands
When you start using gaelige then you can start dictating terms
But as we are both using English then the term British Isles stands
And yet it is still in common usage
This is English we are both conversing in right now
And as such the English naming conventions apply
You may not like it, if so you can call these Isles something else in Irish
But as we are both speaking English then the English naming convention applies here
But yes, I mean we are both conversing in English are we not
So the English naming convention applies here, its common name is the British Isles in English so the name stands
And yet it's the smaller country Both geographicly, and economically
British Isles is more accurate
But they do have a group name, it's called the E.U
Yeah, and in those cases they are using their own native tounges to rename such places
That is cool and to be expected
Yet what you are talking about is changing names and terms in English that already have English names so this is a faulty analogy
As I've said earlier, if you wanna change the name in Irish, to an Irish name for use in Ireland go ahead
Like the French have with the English channel, they call it la manche
We dont, its called the English channel
So why not name the British Isles something more  palatable to your ears in Irish for Irish usage and not worry about how we in the UK name the islands
Expedencey sure, but not at the cost of accuracy
The continent is called North America
The US is commonly called America, yet North America contains Mexico, the USA and Canada
There is no diffence here, the islands are called the british Isles yet contain eire and the UK
I wonder if the canucks and Mexicans are as sensitive as you paddys are or if they don't let this sorta thing phase em
>The UK don't officially refer to the islands as the British Isles, never did actually
It is only the ignorant and rigid assholes who continue to do this
And yet it's still used in common parlance every day, check any map and you'll find the term British Isles in usage
So no it is not only the ignorant or assholes that use it, the only people who seam to have a problem with the term are  paddies with a chip on their shoulders like you
>And my analogy is not faulty as we no longer call Beijing Peking or Bombay Mumbai in English either
We don't continue to call them by their old names as a sign of respect to the people of these countries and what they'd prefer to be called
Yes it is a faulty snology because these people don't use English as their mother tounge, they have native names for these places and have reverted to using those names for those places
The native name for these islands is the British Isles, the name has been used for thousands of years right back into classical antiquety asi have already stated
So your analogy is deeply flawed in that respect
>Naming conventions are not rigid or set in stone and I don't know how it would hurt you to just call it something like the British and Irish Isles (Britain can come first)
We evolve the English language all the time with words falling out of fashion and using new terminology that's more accurate or inclusive
But this is not our problem, the problem is yours
Why should we bend over backwards to accommodate a problem we don't suffer from
The British Isles is an inclusive term, and it's geographicly accurate as it refers to the largest island in the archapeligo
>As for the English Channel, French is the sole official language of France while Ireland has two official languages: Irish and English
It wouldn't be palatable for us to call it the British Isles in English
Then use an Irish term, you have for the Irish Republic, you call it eira,  so why not use an Irish term for the british Isles
It's your tounge so use it for that purpose
The term British Isles is an English term, you don't have to use it
The still reverted to their native names
The native name of the British Isles is
The British Isles,
not a hard  concept to grasp
Yet you really refuse to accept it eh
Or Britain and Ireland
Or just British Isles as Ireland really is the junior partner in this whole operation
>I understand the concept may be challenging for somebody from Wales
Ooooh  no need to get nasty now lol
In Britain nobody does it so I was shocked when I went on holiday to Spain
I think we can probably forgive him for only speaking five languages
We're coming for you, Antarctica
Gonna fuck some penguins right up
Shit me, we've found one in the wild
Then again if Ireland doesn't break into the top 50 it shows what atrocities the UK has done
Mari Lwyd is making a small comeback in Wales
A hobby horse is made from a horses skull, a pole, and a cloak for someone to hide under
The skull is decorated and has a veil
Around Christmas and the new year, Mari Lwyd will visit your house or a pub and demand to be let in
You'll sing verses or Pwnco to each other to stop her from entering but you want to lose
Mari Lwyd will then run around your house chasing away bad spirits for the new year, and causing mischief chasing kids and taking food and drink
It’s making a comeback
Mari Lwyd always creeped me out as a kid
Id' say it's making a resurgence
she appeared last year in my local pub for the first time
and a couple of other Bridgend pubs
I don't think there's a speficic music or dance that goes with it
The dance and music reminds me of Morris dancing
Is there an event for the Capra
A Welshman who doesn’t like rugby
Edit: not me mind
Not a fan of rugby, can't play it nor can I sing or compose poetry
Pretty much failed the basic criteria
Slowly raises hand
This is the correct awnser
Not exactly a horror story but I have never been groped on public transport or anything like that
Went to Paris, got groped twice on the metro
each time I completely froze, but the second time I thought it wasn’t happening for a second or so because it had literally just happened the other day and because it started when he pressed against me like someone could conceivably do on a busy train
Paris was otherwise genuinely full of friendly people (contrary to stereotypes) imo, beautiful, amazing cities and I stayed in a great hostel but I never want to go back ever
I accept I could have just been as unlucky in any other city and most women won’t have this experience but I just associate being on the metro with my holiday experience
I love French history and I’ve put a lot of effort into learning French so it kind of sucks that for me Paris is off the map now
Edit: thanks for suggestions of places, I have been to other places in France and hope to go elsewhere, in fact I’m sad thinking about how many places I can’t go in my lifetime
I hoped to go to Avignon this year haha but covid stopped that
A load of Sheep managed to find an illegal cannabis farm, ate the whole thing and then (presumably stoned) terrorised a nearby village
So, the county I live in decided to rename the popular British dessert ["Spotted Dick"] to "Spotted Richard". Apparently too many people were being rather *immature* when ordering it in the cafeteria  at the council HQ
This news story went viral and they spent the next few days as a global laughing stock, before backing down
Or, as tech news site *The Register* put it:
[UK council forced to swallow dick]
Fantastic, where was that
Ha, that reminds me of the time a guy in my nearest town tried to take a pony [on the train to Holyhead]
Nothing will beat the time some people resprayed an Arriva train into the colours of [Nederlandse Spoorwegen]
Somewhere near to Swansea I believe
Yeah that's a fair point
I doubt it will be changed now though
> Rhydypandy
Seems to be just north of Swansea
Not as rural as I was expecting
Yeah, just looked it up on Google Maps
Not quite where I was expecting
Well yes :P
I meant which village
Welshman here, not a clue
Maggie Thatcher or Eddie Jones (England Rugby manager who called Wales and Ireland "little shit places")
Dafydd Gam I suppose
Fought for the English against his fellow Welshmen
Is well regarded in England as he died at Agincourt, not so much here
>don't think there's really a near-universal hate figure like Petain or so on
Well there is Margaret Thatcher
Most people I know have very little of a positive nature to say about her
Good call on William the conqueror though
You'd think he would be hated but 1000 years of history is quite a long time to hold a grudge
There's an argument that Britain's nationalised industries, like coal and steel, were in pretty poor shape in the 1970s and 1980s, in the grip of trade unions, there was a need for either reform or closure
In some ways that's fair enough
Britain had the reputation as "the sick man of Europe" in the 1970s, industrial strikes were rife, there was a three day week etc
However, those industries were closed down with little or no retraining and education put in place to support their former workers
It's left former coal mining areas like the [South Wales Valleys] suffering from the effects of *generations* of poverty to this day
EDIT: changed a few sentences
Aye I hope that bitch maggie burns in hell
There are still mining towns in wales that haven't recovered from that cows vendetta against miners 36 years later
The more I've read up on it, the more I've realised you can't pin it all on Maggie
Maybe you could say her Government helped finish those industries off
Then again, despite all the privatisations of gas, water, electric and telecoms that her Government presided over, privatising the railways was a step too far for Mrs T.
But the effects of the coal mines closing are still being felt to this day, so I needed to lead in to the article I linked
I've actually learned quite a lot from comments and links people have provided on Reddit over the years
Particularly when Maggie died
I think the pronunciation is okay with the exception of a few sounds that are hard to pronounce
The grammar is impossible thanks to mutations but I think it’s possible to sound close to a native speaker
Well, there’s so many accents even in native English that it’s basically pointless to try and learn one
I don’t see the point really as long as I can understand you
That being said, I once met someone from Lithuania who learnt English here and he had the weirdest Lithuanian-Welsh combination accent and that was great
I’m all for people speaking in their natural accent, linguistic diversity is more interesting
That normally gives it away that you're not a native speaker if you obey the mutations
To properly sound like a native speaker you need to put contractions upon contractions and ignore the proper mutations in favour of what sounds most natural after being contracted
I was about to say this
I now a Danish guy on Diacord and I asked him:
"so where are you from, cause you sound English but you're one hour ahead of me
He asked me to guess and I said south East England somewhere (I guessed he was studying abroad or something)
Then he tells me he's Danish and has only been to England for about a total of 2 weeks in his whole life
The English for inventing football
Spain for showing us how to play it properly
France and Italy for all the food recipes
And finally Ze Germans for the cars
Yeah, I noticed that, I guess it was a reference to Noraid and Irish Americans rather than the USA
They have 60 minutes to fill rather than the 30 minutes of the main BBC / ITV broadcasts, though
>larger than ... the Isle of Man
Best celebrate with a motorcycle race then
> in the UK we used to use Wales for size, until they actually started complaining
I don't recall us complaining about that
We can't win, lol
Oh, that's a good way of changing it round
England, although it's rarely reciprocated outside of Rugby Union :P
As a welshman, the only rivalry we can have is with England, because they're the only country we border
But obviously as a Briton we have a bit of a rivalry with France, as there is a lot of history between us fighting
England
but its mostly while playing rugby and things like that
*British/Celtic Isles Thunderdome*
That just seems to be the way Wales go, I think
Grand Slam one year, battling for the Wooden Spoon the next :P
Shaun Edwards, surely
Gareth is off doing travel documentaries now, he was going round Wales in a canal boat last time I looked
No worries, I can barely remember what day it is now
I really don't get the resort holidays a lot of Brits seem to like in places like Spain/ Cyprus/ Turkey
They literally don't leave the hotel the entire time they're there, apart from to go to the beach of course and only mingle with other Brits
If I've spent all that money and time to go somewhere I want to see a bit more of the place then just a hotel and a beach and I want to learn at least something about the country I'm in and it's history and culture
Maybe its just because I'm not a beach holiday kind of person in general
Welsh and English
Moron - Idiot in English; Carrot in Welsh
(On mobile) if you go on the subreddit and click the ••• in the corner, select ‘change user flair’ and pick your country out of the list
Well, I guess that we are doing kind of ok here with there being pros and cons
Pros
- Having good connections via the sea
- Very defensible, mainly if you use the terrain to your advantage
- Lots of profitable ventures to be had - wool, coal, slate, iron and steel, sheep, cows, leather
- Beautiful scenery
Cons
- Very unfortunate neighbours *cough England cough*
- Mainly mountainous terrain although it is beautiful and all that it does make the land fairly hard to traverse
- Because of the terrain it's quite hard to grow crops
Alright except the neighbours east make a lot of noise
Yeah but when England does something the rest of the world thinks that Britain did it
Either way, sorry Ireland
Welcome home
In Welsh toilet is “ty bach”, small house, from the toilets being in a small building outside
So you might say you’re going to the little house
Similar it seems
Nah, over here they where pretty much the subject of ridicule and laughter
Ladas were most popular about 30 years ago in the UK back when the cheap simplicity of the build was on par with other makes
You bought different makes for either the few mod cons or the image
Once the other makes were able to provide more mod cons and improvements, the Lada went the way of the Dodo
Funnily enough, Skoda was the same, but if you ever owned a Skoda, you would still look down on a Lada
No where else in the world I have been almost ran over by a scooter as many times as I have in Naples
You say that
But as Queen she does have royal perogative
She could quite easely command some tough as nails royal protection officer to slap seven shades of shit outta anyone who approaches her
Never underestimate a old royal
Not many royals get to the age of 94
It would be a bad time to fi d out why that old bird has endured so long lol
Especially if he's got his dogs
My Chinese friend was complaining that his housemate's cat had fleas and he'd been bitten
He said saffron was good to rub on the bites, which I thought was extravagant considering the price
We argued in confusion for a minute and he ran to his room and came back with a tube of Savlon antiseptic cream *facepalm*
> Yes, this measure could be different for different parts of Russia too
Once I've been to Yaroslavl and had trouble with roaming and the manager in a store said that it is easier for me to go to Kostroma and buy sim-cart there
For context, where are you travelling from
Omsk
The second map certainly gets your point across
Wales is a nation of alcoholics so its completely normal
The US has a very puritan view to drinking imo, but it's weird, when ever I see TV shows people are often drink driving which is frowned upon in the UK
>If all 4 of them have drinking competition who would win
England would leave to do coke in the toilets half way through and wouldn't be seen for the rest of the night
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would end up singing outside a kebab shop/ chippy at 5am
I think it's Finland (somebody will correct if wrong) actually have a term for sitting at home in your pants getting drunk :)
Sure, but conversely, all those laws which say you can't enjoy a glass of wine with a picnic in a park, that's just uncivil
TIL Finland classes me as an alcoholic
Saturday night in Bristol = Tuesday morning in Leeds
I would say Bristol was a bad shout, though it’s not so much drinking to get drunk but more of all other substances going on there
To be honest I was struggling to think of Southern cities with good nightlife
Still whatever goes on in Bristol happens x20 in Leeds
Half the country descending on Cardiff city centre/local pubs around the country on international rugby match days, drinking a lot and singing
When I was small a girl in Ireland (in a hotel) did this on purpose to me once on a staircase
I still have nightmares
That is literally my favourite sentence
You couldn’t have known but this is like precisely my sense of humour hahaha
Chips, cheese, curry - nothing better after a night out
Aye, that is the food of champions that tbf
Thank god you explained that
For a second I thought you guys might have been selling the other kind of "spice" at ya local takeaways
Totally forgot about these beauties
I wouldn't call it fast food per say but it is definitely a underrated bit of munch
A pie butty maybe
I know ya jocks are into ya weird shit lol
In terms of things like Government institutions, no
They'll often fly the Welsh and UK flags, and until recently maybe the EU flag too
You do tend to see more Welsh flags flown during sporting events, particularly events like the Six Nations rugby tournament and the Rugby World Cup
'Normally' - yes, you do see a few houses with the Welsh flag flying - it's almost the reverse of the situation in England
Yes, it can be classed as nationalist, but there aren't the same sort of right wing associations with flying the flag
A lot of people don't consider the Union Flag to represent Wales as we were technically conquered by England when the UK was founded
In Wales
We definitely have the welsh flag out for St David’s day, Yr Urdd and the Eisteddfod
Always up for our municipal building and government branches
In my job, which is working with children
We display the Welsh culture more prominently, then British
It's very popular in Wales to have the Welsh flag everywhere
Tea towels, mugs, ornaments, car stickers
The Union Jack is less abundant
Its more normal to fly a Wales or St David's flag than a UK one here
A lot of people I know own a flag but don't fly/ display it (it comes our for the rugby)
I've seen a few houses in the South-west flying flags
Not been down that way since last year, mind you
Yes, it's much smaller than the Scottish one, but I feel that the 'penny has dropped' following things like the Brexit vote
Sure, Wales voted to Leave the EU, but there are entire towns that [were rebuilt with EU funding] People in cities like Swansea - Wales' *second city* - [have eventually realised] that they've lost a lot of infrastructure projects that were once promised
So there have been some [rallies about Independence] that sort of thing
EDIT: IIRC support for Welsh independence varies, as [this link suggests] Figures from 7% to 30% have been quoted, but the questions that lead to those figures are often very different
Pretty much, I would add that some polls are putting support for independence as high as 30% which is up from less that 5% in 2015
[Three generations of the same family working as miners] this is pretty much what most of South Wales was like from the industrial revolution until the 1980s, when the mines were all shut (still a controversial issue)
If your dad was a miner then chances are that you'd be down the mines by the time you were a teenager, it was literally the only source of income in many towns, so naturally the death of the mining industry was devastating for Wales, especially the South Wales Valleys
We still haven't economically recovered and the Valleys are the poorest region in Western/ Northern Europe
I pay £27 for unlimited 5G data in the UK
Includes unlimited calls too
When I was working in a pub you definitely could tell which people thought they were outright better than you because you were working there
Sometimes I think increased by the fact you’re young
The majority of customers are normal, you don’t remember the interactions
Then there’s a handful who think they become your boss for the time their in the establishment
It’s been a few years now and I’m not sure I could allow people to clap or whistle to get my attention like some sort of dog
Depends on your network really
I don't go with the cheapest, I go for good coverage
Wikipedia also says that *Newsround* broke some other major stories:
>The programme was also first in Britain to report an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in Vatican City in 1981 and provided the first reports from the Windsor Castle fire of November 1992
IIRC it was on the Children's BBC segment at 5pm, so they could get stories like *Challenger* exploding ahead of the main evening news at 6pm
A few more from the UK:
**Chain** - roughly 20
116 metres
Still used to measure distances on our railway network - eg a station being 11 miles and 62 chains from London
**Furlong** - roughly 201 metres
Still used as a unit of measurement in horse racing
**Barleycorn** - about 8
47 millimetres
For some reason this is still used as a basis of measurement for shoe size
Oh, good call
We're still using this weird half and half mix in the UK
It would be easier if we just went fully metric and allowed for things like 'pint' as a colloquial term or something
I was a GP in Bristol at a practice that had a lot of students register each year
We were having this very debate - is stone still in use (I'm only 35) so some computer whizz looked at the new patient registration forms which had the option to give weight in stone or kg and found that something like 75% of students (so people aged 18-21 in 2017) gave their weight in stone
So I'm always confused when I encounter Redditors who claim that 'no one uses stone' because my personal experience is the vast majority of people use it, and everyone understands it
tbh mate we're all banging models and driving Ferraris over here, we don't worry about how much our trips will cost
The Welsh language
When I was younger and had to learn it in school I really didn't see the point in learning a language that so few people speak (500,000 isn't a particularly low number but thats how I thought) especially because my area has very few Welsh speakers, we used to joke that there was no point learning unless you wanted to live in Argentina or North Wales
Now one of my biggest regrets is not trying harder with Welsh and I really wish I could speak it
I'm going to give it another go once I've graduated from university
Yeah it pains me to see people that still have my former attitude
I get it when youre in school and youre forced to do something you will dislike it but surely once youre an adult you should learn to appreciate it at the very least, even if you have no intention of learning it yourself
Sadly there are still many people that want to see the language die
I left wales at a young age, but still identify myself as welsh and i am slowly but surely relearning the language becuase having a basic outsiders view point has made me realsie the importance of the preservation of languages and cultrues
Yeah for me my opinion started to change when I went off to England for university
England
Ireland
Scotland
Cheating here but Vikings, if pushed Denmark over Norway I think, but whichever not in this one, would be in 5
France
Far far more about England than any of the others really
Ireland in the earlier history with raids but also to do with Christianity
Lowland Scotland was historically Brythonic and spoke old Welsh
After that England sort of drew a wedge between us
Viking’s were nowhere near as involved in Wales as in England, but there were a few settlements along the coast, mainly Swansea (Sweyn’s Sea), named after a Danish king
France acknowledged our independence for a few years during Owain Glyndwr’s revolt and sent some troops over
Brittany is a Celtic region with relations with Wales
For Wales, it'd be something like this:
England
Ireland
USA
France
Argentina
England
Scotland
Rome
Ireland
The rest of the empire
England
Romans(obviously not a country but not much I can add)
At least as a group the Norsemen/Viking’s
Haven’t got a clue past that
Huh good shout, I guess we'll have to drop France then
aha
In the 19th Century, a number of Welsh left for Patagonia to set up a Welsh colony, free from English rule and language
They formed the nucleus for Patagonian colonisation, and there are still many Welsh speakers and large cultural influences
The colony's name was "Y Wladfa", lit
The Colony
Please, search it up~
We're very descriptive at naming things xD
A lot of the signatures on the US Declaration of Independence are also Welsh descendants
A few of them even spoke the language fluently too
I honestly don't see the issue, people who want to waste money on games get to waste money and support the game for the rest of us, while those of us who don't want to buy them don't have to as they don't really provide much of an advantage anyway
The issue there though, is how do children, especially young children have access to paying at that age
Call me old fashioned (at the ripe old age of 18) but I don't think children need debit/credit cards until mid teens
And if a parent just simply let's their kid buy whatever they want without checking, then that's more bad parenting than the fault of anyone else
Why should games companies be forced to change to accomplish something which doesn't harm them and is primarily a result of the actions of the parents
Parents are the ones who are being negatively impacted by loot boxes, so surely they should be the ones to change their practices, especially since it is quite easy for them and solves a whole host of potential other issues
and they aren't going to be able to get them in great number without either parental supervision or access to a parent's credit cars are they
Unless people just leave £50 notes lying around, but that's just asking for it
Actually I would argue that that logic does hold up for alcohol
As I've been elaborating on elsewhere in the thread, for children under the working age (which I think is 14 for part time work and 16 for full work here ) they are forced to rely on money from their parents or other family members, in that sense it is easy to control whether or not they consume alcohol
At the age they can start working, surely if they are nature enough to work, then they are mature enough to drink and if not then surely the working age should be raised until they are mature enough to make sensible decisions
Phew that was a hot take
How does ones area of living affect ones ability to pickpocket
And furthermore, how does that statement even actually help your point at all
And having access to that shop doesn't make a jot of difference if they don't have the capability to pay, ie parental consent and funding
Wait wait, so kids spending the what £5 they earn from a paper round, on a game they enjoy is bad all of a sudden
There is a clear difference between spending £5 the child has sent themselves and spending £1,000 off of mum's card without her consent, that's patently obvious
For Wales the closest “brother” countries would maybe be Scotland and Ireland, though they seem a lot closer to each other than Wales
The closer regions in terms of language, history and culture are Cornwall and Brittany, Brittany is a bit less of a brother since they are French & Celtic but Cornwall is a good candidate for brother
There’s also a community in Patagonia in Argentina that’s speaks Welsh, these could be considered pretty close too
I'd probably have to say England, they are kind of like an annoying younger brother who thinks they are always right and keeps stealing stuff from us
Wouldn’t change a thing really
I believe there is no one definition for how the dragon should appear on the flag - so all red dragons on a white and green even background are technically valid Welsh flags
I would like to see more of the [flag of St David] but I wouldn’t like it to replace the current one
Also, [Glyndŵr’s flag] is pretty cool, though it’s almost exclusively used as a symbol for independence movements, so wouldn’t be able to represent all of Wales
I would give NI back to Ireland and remove st patrick's satire, restoring the flag of the Kingdom of Great Britain
As it should be :)
I quite like that, I always thought it would clash of it was incorporated but it seems good there
There is a growing independence/unhappiness here with the way Wales is ruled so there may be an attempt to ‘placate’ Wales with representation on the flag, I’m not sure if it’ll make a huge difference though, more devolution does seem somewhat inevitable even if the current U.K. government is very anti-devolution
As much as it would be class to have a dragon on the Union Jack, it’s probably not there for a reason and that reason being it doesn’t look right on the Union Jack, the Union Jack is a brilliant flag and I don’t really think it needs improvement, especially with a dragon on it
It’s because Wales was forcibly annexed by England into the Kingdom of England
Then when Scotland joined with the Act of Union it was just England + Scotland, then they added Ireland in later
At the time of the Union Flags inception Wales wasn’t considered separate to England, with the hope that it would somewhat lose its identity like other Celtic areas did, to different degrees (Cumbria, then Cornwall and the Isle of Man)
We have the puffins on Puffin Island
And various stories of sleeping dragons across Wales
Maybe not so well known now, but The Swansea Jack's death was reported nationally when he died
In Swansea there was a pub named after him, and there are statues .
Basically a dog who rescued drowning people, 29
Not a lot of people hear Welsh a lot, so the descriptions vary a lot
I’ve had it sounds Arabic, Icelandic, Elvish, sing-songy, impossible you pronounce
Some people say it sounds ‘stupid’ when they hear words like “teledu” for television or “mathemateg” for mathematics
Usually from English only speakers though
A lot pf people say that Welsh is basically Elvish (Sindarin), and probably even harder to speak correctly but seeing as Tolkien based Sindarin from Welsh and aome other languages, I'd say this is a fairly accurate assumption
The neighbours usuallynlaigh at it and say its dead/pointless/irrelevant
Not to sure what people further afield think of it
I believe Tolkien based most of his Elvish on a combination of Welsh and Icelandic but that’s doesn’t mean he never looked at Irish
Welsh similarly has a lot of vowels (2 more than English), but because they are w and y a lot of people see Welsh as having no vowels in words like ‘gwyl’ and ‘cwmystwyth
My favourite is when they laugh at the word for ambulance, which is “ambiwlans”, and then I ask what the English for ambulance is, and they still don’t see the hypocrisy
It’s literally just a French word
The th sounds are also in Welsh, the voiced and unvoiced sounds are written th and dd respectively

Yes
Front door is basically always locked unless we've got someone calling with a delivery
Back door is locked unless we're outside or in the back of the house
Of course everything's locked at night & when we're away
I leave the door to my flat unlocked but there is an automatically locking door to get into the building anyway
Jon mêd his wê tw a tafern thrw ddy darc fforest, onli tw ffaind awt ddat hi fforgot ddy mynu
I find it interesting how j gets changed to dj or dz in most languages
In Welsh:
Aeth Ioan ar ei ffordd i'r dafarn trwy'r coedwig dywyll, ond i gofio wnaeth ei anghofio ei arian
Should be something like this
I'm currently learning and from the South, but could this also be accurate
"Jon meid hys wei tw ei tafern thrw ddu darc fforest ownli tw ffaind awt ddat hi fforgot ddu mhni
We tend to flatten "ai" to "ê", like parêd yn lle parade
Whether the gov should give free food to children who live in poverty so they can eat during the holidays, the gov says no, and the press says yes
And in Wales, what counts as essential for shops to sell during lockdown, vodka is, children's winter coats are not
You'll probably like the story about the other guy who went to the store in his [boxer shorts] in protest, then
You can't say women anymore, it's " people who have periods"
For the UK as a whole, it would definitely be Cambridge and Oxford
For wales however
Cardiff University has become the top University in Wales, I would say this is then followed by Bangor and Aberystwyth University
We also have a lot colleges as well, which are pretty good
It’s weird, I go to a “red brick” uni
And some friends from school went to other ones
Even when they have a lot of history and a good reputation, doesn’t mean the education they provide isn’t occasionally sub par
I think Liverpool dropped lower than the other unis in Liverpool in many rankings recently, and the number of poorly taught lectures courses and modules I’ve had is too high
The lecturers are incredibly clever and very much near the top of their field, but that doesn’t translate to them being good at teaching
It just feels to me that sometimes these universities just try to take advantage of the fact that their reputation is so high and not make sure they are actually providing a top class course
Yeah I agree that the ranking systems and such aren’t great either, was just an observation
I had a friend at Uni of and one at John Moores and they just used the ranking thing as banter
I think with less prestigious unis there’s a lot more scope for teaching since that’s sometimes entirely what the university is for
Like you’ve said, staff at Russell group unis are required or expected to produce a lot of top class research and teach to a high standard
Wales is less corrupt than full UK parliment, partly cuz we have no money to steal from our economy anyway

We've never had a female monarch funnily enough
Slightly off topic, but I have to say the Andalusia flag is absolutely gorgeous
As other countries have said, we feel a lot closer to famous people
For a capital city, Cardiff has a pretty small city centre
Which means I’ve bumped into a fair few Welsh or local ‘celebs’ over the years
It’s been fairly common for people I know to see filming for things like Doctor Who and Sherlock etc take place in public
This is because we have the BBC studios and such a small city compared to London, so seeing things filmed there might not be so common
If a Welsh story makes it onto the UK wide news, we know it’s a big deal
But the ‘regional’ news is actually the news for the whole of Wales, when in England it’s just a few counties, which shows how small we are
I have seen people I know on the Welsh news on quite a few occasions, just being interviewed as locals etc
I do live in Cardiff, so my experiences might be vastly different to those who live elsewhere in the country
Not all people, I am learning Spanish because I like visiting there, and the areas I visit many people don't speak English, plus you get much more out of the holidays
Although I suppose the good thing about speaking English is you get to choose your 2nd language as you please
Maybe if the US had it's own national language you might feel differently, but when you speak the language from a small island on the edge of Europe , then it's never going to be something you can be proud of as your own
It's complicated
I guess that I identify as Welsh British

Here in Wales, it's the dualling of the [A465 road] particularly through the Clydach Gorge
The current section of work is both [behind schedule and over budget]
For the wider UK, London's [Crossrail] project is the obvious answer
The central tunnel section, station construction and integration of three different signalling systems are proving complex
Originally scheduled to open in December 2018, [it is now projected to open in 2021] Covid-19 may push that date back to 2022
Yeah, I was under the impression that some stations would remain closed once the system had opened
I think the main issue was the Crossrail 'team' not communicating the delays properly to the Mayor etc
The sections outside of the tunnels are running, eg London - Reading and London - Shenfield, which is impressive
I did read that the pandemic situation had 'paused' work though
I want to see it now
Holy shit haha
Looks like my old school ID
To be honest I don't think people are as worried about cornonavirus here than in other countries, I remember people being genuinely scared during the Ebola and Swineflu epidemics but this time its different
Ive played way too much Assasins creed odyssey to know otherwise lol
I went to school with a girl named Chardonnay, and another called Leaf
Leaf’s surname was unfortunate too but I don’t want to ID a random girl on reddit, especially with a unique name like that
Also it wasn’t like Leif the Scandinavian name, but genuinely Leaf as the parents were very hippy-ish
Chardonnay seemed a little tragic and chavvy, Leaf could’ve been a cool name but it didn’t work

Honestly, I think availability of charging points is going to be the biggest deal with electric cars
Not so much the plug standard or 'service provider'.
Tesla in the UK are following the US model for example, by building Superchargers along the motorway network here
Meanwhile most of the locations on Zap Map in rural parts of the UK seems to be at guest houses or stately homes, not really ideal for the average driver IMO
IIRC there is an EU standard for all new high-speed railway lines
They must be built with 1,435mm gauge track (Standard gauge), ETCS Level 2 signalling and 25 kV AC overhead electrification
Going by some common definitions:
Standard Gauge: 1,435mm
Iberian Gauge: 1,668mm
Russian Gauge: 1,520mm
Irish Gauge: 1,600mm
Indian Gauge: 1,676mm
We've got about 7 different types of narrow gauge here in Wales just on [heritage steam railways]
Track gauges
Yes:
Standard Gauge: 1,435mm
Iberian Gauge: 1,668mm
Russian Gauge: 1,520mm
Irish Gauge: 1,600mm
Indian Gauge: 1,676mm
We've got about 7 different types of narrow gauge here in Wales just on [heritage steam railways]
I mean it makes life a lot easier when travelling in countries where you don't speak the local language (like when I went to Hungary for example)
It does make us lazier though
Its not hard to learn a few basic phrases (hello, goodbye, thank you, cheers, one beer please, do you speak English

It depends where you are, but Oliver Cromwell is still reviled by many people more than 300 years later

Its hard to find welsh translations for things, so where possible i like to use that but they are wrong most times, ie, not many games have minor language translations, but sites like Microsoft and Google are more opening
I've seen plenty of comments where Scotland and Ireland are congratulated for "fighting back" against "the evil Brits" who are "oppressing" them (ignoring the fact that Scots ARE British
Meanwhile, somebody types a comment in Welsh
Cue the jokes that they've had a stroke, are summoning Cthulu or had the cat walk over their keyboard
You see similar things where the SNP get 45 seats in an Election and it's like Braveheart 2
0, but when Plaid Cymru gains ONE seat here in Wales and it just gets slagged off as "that stupid Welsh independence party" or similar
Sheep
Even though NZ has more
> Having a weird-ass language
We get that here in Wales
To the point that major brands think [this sort of thing] is a good idea
Even in 2020
That's pretty solid assessment
In fairness to Denmark its not as if it was considered to be the premier armed fighting force on land that France was considered to be
Poor Denmark could never have been expected to fight against nazi germany
Not in any way tbh
Back then France was considered by many people to  posses the most powerful military on the mainland continent
The perceived wisdom was that Germany would get curbstomped by the French
Obviously history didn't play out that way
The irony here is I once had a joke book about different nations and all the Sheep shagging jokes were about Scottish people, IIRC it was Aberdeen that was the target of abuse
My issue here isn't the number of seats, more how the sort of people who cheer on the SNP then dump on Plaid
I mean, both parties have the same aims, that sort of thing
Thanks
Nah, we've been getting this shit *long* before Brexit
I'm not sure where everything fits in with the Picts and various Celts, but I'd say us Welsh have been around almost as long
Bear in mind the demonym "Welsh" derives from an Anglo-Saxon word, *Wealh*, meaning "others"...
We've been on the receiving end of this shit for decades, long before people complained that everything was "too PC".
Schools were practically [*beating* the Welsh language out of children as recently as the 1940s]
When we try and defend our culture, we get told we're "overreacting", that it was just "a joke". Except that's what they said the last time, and the time before that
and well, *every* time this happens
Ha, no worries
Is that just because Aberdeen is quite northern
"Barod neu ddim, mae'r helwr yn dod
Ready or not, the Hunter's coming
"Yn barod neu ddim rwyn dod" ready or not, coming
Quite simple yet effective
barod neu beidio yma Dwi'n dod
barod ai peidio, dyma fi'n dod
Both, welsh is a fucked language, the south are more formal in the way they speak it so like me for instance i will speak closer to the type they use on google translate, national news and language learning programs, the north have a more informal and older way of speaking, because the english almost irradiated welsh from the south so they brought it back
It also has the same construct as older arabic old hebrew and irish
I mean I've never encountered a Welsh speaking Patagonian but I'm sure that there would be a few differences
Englands (general) arrogance
You hear it a lot, especially when the football is on, they love to shit on other countries
A lot of the time is banter which is fine, but sometimes it does seem to cross into the territory of malice
The English based press are the worst offenders for this
It's an outlet, I do think a lot of that has to do with the fact that being English is treated as a bit of a dirty thing
Unlike Welsh patriotism or even Scottish patriotism, English patriotism only seams to get an outlet during sporting events
At any other time they rightly or wrongly get accused of being a nutty EDL type
So I do feel bad for the English at times
Especially when it comes to acts of patriotism
We don't hate England
England is like our annoying older cousin, we don't always see eye to eye but ultimately we're still family
>Why the rest of the UK seem to hate us but we like them
Definitely not true, and I say this as a Welshman who has lived in England for 20 years
I love England, its a beautiful country, not quite as beautiful as Wales but beautiful never the less
Honestly I think some of this "hate" is manufactured by the media, and the gobby sods on social media that spout it off are just a loud vocal minority
Yes, a lot of that comes down to the UK = England attitude that many in the media and politics have
English people are supposed to be proud to be British as a replacement, meanwhile in W and S British identity supplements the local identity (if we identify as British that is)
> 400 Englishmen telling you "that's just our our sense of humor"
See also: any 'joke' about the Welsh language
Anything less than winning Euros/ World Cups is failure for a lot of them and particularly for the press
I mean to be fair to them they never said exactly when it's coming home, could be next year, could be in 100 years
>Booing whenever an english coach or player is on the big screen
I mean England's rugby coach did call Wales a "shit little place", saying things like that doesn't tend to go down well with the people that live there no matter where they are
I've been in pubs in Wales with the rugby on with English, Irish, Australian, Scottish, French, Italian, Kiwi, South African etc fans and its never been anything other than a friendly atmosphere
I've been in pubs in England quietly watching a rugby game in my Wales top and been angrily shouted at by English fans many times
I'm sure there are dickheads from Wales, Scotland and Ireland that also get gobby when the rugby is on, but it seems far more institutionalised in England
For a country that loves to dish out 'banter' they do tend to get a tad touchy
My mum's English, I was born in England, support an English football team and I went to an English university
I do not hate England
Criticism =/= hate
Theres a lot to love about England but there are also things to criticise
A lot of the time when Welsh/ Scottish/ Irish people criticise England we are criticising the political establishment (ie Westminster, the UK media etc) not the English as a people
I'm not saying that it doesn't happen in Wales too on occasion
However, it does seem that for many in England the instinctive reaction to victory (or defeat for that matter) is to stuck up the magic v's to the opposition
The only times I've heard of/ seen something similar happen here is between Cardiff and Swansea fans, its far more common (in my experience) to just shake the other lots hand and have a drink with them
I've seen that happen in England too, but almost never when international games are concerned
I think England is a lovely place full of amazing people but because of people like Boris Johnson, they always get a bad reputation
We judge them for the actions of others and think nothing of it
This thread has made me realise that I’ve heard a lot of bad things said about England but not Scotland, Wales or NI
It’s not fair
Sorry to all the English people
From the UK, of the top of my head I can think:

Tippex - Correction Fluid

Crossing while clear is socially accepted, even encouraged here
It just seems so to my mind to wait if there is no reason not to cross
You should've told her Europeans celebrate it on April 7th because we write dates the other way round
Not sure if we have one for cities and countryisde, but the people of north Wales call those in south Wales Hwnts, and the people of south Wales refer to the north Welsh as Gogs
Hwnts derives from Hwntu which means yonder/over there, Gogs is the shortened version of Gogledd meaning North
Come to think about it, "forgotten about" may be used
A guy I know was in Greece (I think) in a touristy hotspot
There were lots of people outside restaurants trying to get people in, shouting in English, German etc
A common thing Welsh people will do is just reply in Welsh until they stop because they don’t know the language at all, and assume you don’t know any that they’re speaking
I’ve done this to avoid street sellers and pushy restaurant staff a lot
So this guy and his wife do that, “Shwmae
” and just start speaking Welsh to the waiter, only for him to reply in Welsh
Turns out he was married to a Welsh woman and they ran the restaurant together
They ended up all eating there together and had a great time
If you consider the England to Wales to Scotland travellers this happens incredibly regularly

It’s similar with Scotland
It’s slightly less common to travel to “the mainland”, but if someone says they are going to France next week it’s really normal
I went to Spain in November to see a friend and the return flight was £20, literally cheaper than the train back to Wales from university
Many people work in Europe, my uncle used to travel to Brussels once every few weeks for work
There’s a few in English from Welsh which is the uncommon way around
It’s hard to say which words are from Welsh or whether they share a common Brythonic ancestor
Penguin, is thought to have come from pen-gwyn, meaning white head, and pronounced the same
Corgi, the dog breed, is from the Welsh cor meaning dwarf and ci meaning dog, so dwarf dog
Potentially the word flannel, from gwlanen meaning “flannel wool” apparently
These next lot are a lot more speculative, but still interesting
Adder, from Welsh neidr, which is just snake I believe
Potentially crockery, from crochan
Crumpet, from crempog
Gull is from Welsh or Cornish, gwylan or guilan
Iron, from hearn
[Here’s] a longer list
I just tried to choose the most interesting and most common words
Edit: Penguin should be in the more speculative section
Ever have a "Mufti" (non-uniform / "own clothes") day in school
The word ["Mufti"] has it's origins in Islamic culture, and also seems to date back to the days of the British Empire in India
Hardly any from Welsh, although corgi means dwarf dog in Welsh
I’m sure ‘dad’ comes from the Welsh ‘tad’ as opposed to father, which would’ve been the original English word
Hadn't thought of that, good point
This doesn't work as a UK question
The 2nd language of Scotland is Scots, of Wales is Welsh, of  Ireland is Irish and of England os Polish
High-school IT techie (working in England)
Your comments echo things my teaching colleagues have said
Its everywhere here it's so prevalent that if I wanted to I could get a hook up in my home village in the Welsh marches if I where so enclined and once you manage to reach the large towns and cities you can get it within ten minutes
Most people I know from their mid 50s to late teen use it, in fact I'm seen as the odd one out for not touching it tbh
It's not just Wales though, I'm told my experience is UK wide
There are potheads all over the country
Sounds like a simular situation to Wales and the UK as a whole tbh
Its incredibly easy to get ahold of
Even during lockdown supprisingly
Sounds familiar,  I'm in my mid 30s most of my mates who are in their late 20s and early 30s smoke it, they have since their teens and even a few of their parents, who are in their mid 50s and are old school ravers puff it
Its fairly widespread in my experience even in the sleepy shires of England and over the border in quiet Welsh villages
Its fairly commonplace in my experience
Yep, even in my small village of <1,000 people it’s easy enough to find
I think I only know of two people who are dead set against it at my age, 20s, and then maybe a few more older people are too
My dad is fairly against it but I think that’s because of him being from NI
My mum used to smoke when she was younger
It would make so much money if it was legalised
Would be safer too I suppose
I was in the crackdown camp many years ago but now I really do think we need to legalise and control the market instead
If it where regulated like alcohol or tobbaco then I think we could reduce future cases of mental health issues arising
As it is at the mo, its the fucking wild west out there
No one is in control
Yeah, or just let people get plants for themselves so they don’t have to give money and control to potentially dangerous and exploitative gangs in order to get hold of it
The majority of people who smoke it have a good relationship with it
Those that are addicted would be able to get better help, with the money from legalisation adding to mental health and addiction services
I don’t see a single negative personally, I don’t even think the numbers of users would change drastically
If it wasn't for the flags next to people's usernames I'd bot be able to tell I was talking to non native speakers a lot of the time
*Rheilffordd*, meaning "railway". I don't think there are other terms in Welsh
Yes, cant remember the exact amount but i think about ⅓ of our country is national parks and the rest is small towns and villages, the further to the middle you go the less people there are
There’s no untouched land in Wales, but if you go into some of the mountains, and off a trail, you might be able to go a day or two without seeing someone, especially if you managed to find a wooded area
While there’s a low population density in parts of Wales, there are a lot of lanes and farms and walking trails, so eventually someone will pass by, but it is still wonderful countryside
That reminds me, a while back I found out that *London alone* has more population than Wales and Scotland combined
(Plus about half of Northern Ireland, if I'm remembering the numbers right
) It always kinda breaks my brain a little
Northern islands are probably your best bet for that kind of thing, yeah
A Google search suggests the IoM has almost exactly the same population density as Wales
(Roughly 146-149 people per square kilometre)
Not at all
Head of State is an inherited title so we don't get a say anyway
Our current head of Government was born in the US and its almost never a topic of discussion
Edit: We've had Prime Ministers born in Canada (while it was a UK colony), the US and Ireland (While it was an English client state)
Lucky French
The media and politicians are in practically in bed with eachother in most places
Ireland, or possibly Scotland
Either way it was a mutual dislike of the English invading our lands
What about the Anglo-Spanish war
There were  claimants to the portugese throne on both sides, however the ruler at the time (and Portugal with him)  were on the Spanish side
No, but Primark in the UK always has piles of t-shirts with a seemingly random American city or state name on the front
Yes, normally they have things like "police" or "security" on them and they just look weird so I ignore them
I've had similar conversations with friends and relatives, yeah
Not looked in H&M, I know they do some men's stuff, I've just never been in one
Oh, rhinestones are cool again
Honestly it feels like Primark just make t-shirts with any old place on, for £4 who cares if it's thrown out in 6 months, right
Yeah that sounds like a lot of the t-shirts Primark have
If you took all the text off the picture would be quite nice
It's not popular anymore
Still seems big with the teens at the school I work at
Yes but increasingly they're 'local' versions for London etc
After the bombing at the Ariana Grande convert a few years ago there were a lot of I ️ MCR shirts (Manchester
I'm glad I don't, because that's just annoyed me seeing that
Authentic what
though
Hah, fair enough
They have their place, I've got some cheap jeans and t-shirts from them
Their underwear (boxer shorts) is pretty good too
For slobbing in the garden, mowing the lawn, £10 jeans are fine
A few of em still have superdry backpacks, but that's about it
I don't exactly "interact" with them (unless they need a computer password changing or something), but sometimes you're stuck on the corridors at lesson changes
If you can, just for the laugh really
Ha, cheers
Yeah that looks like a Primark one alright
Mainly UK (especially Wales) and Ireland
Outside of us I keep an eye on my family & friends politics towards elections and if something big happens (Germany, Poland, Spain & Netherlands)
What is the scariest place in your country
I am posting this at 5 am because why not
we invented it
We all remember when we were 14, drinking crofters cider in the local park
Me and my dad both renewed our season tickets with the rugby team we follow despite the league not going ahead this year
Traditionally, a chosen first name then (optionally) ap/ ferch (son of/ daughter of) and then father's first name, so a child of Rhys called Dafydd would be Dafydd (ap) Rhys
It was not uncommon for this to extend to multiple generations, so names like Dafydd ap Rhys ap Llywelyn ap Tomos ap Gruffudd (Dafydd son of Rhys, son of Llywelyn, son of Tomos, son of Gruffydd) did exist
This changed once the English custom of fixed surnames became favoured by the nobility in Wales
In many parts of Wales Welsh people began to adopt an anglicised versions of Welsh names, which is why so many people in Wales are called Jones, Williams, Davies or Price, as there is only a limited selection of anglicised Welsh surnames
In more modern times its the chosen first name, an (optional) middle name then a surname, usually the father's but sometimes double barrelled or hybrid between the father's and mother's
Probably a farmer or dead as without glasses I’m not sure I would’ve been able to see anything important
I know they are older but I doubt I’d have had good access to them
Merthyr Tydfil, he works in the local chippy with Elvis
Ooh I love seeing the use of ‘quare’ in the wild
Makes me think of my Granda though lol
I’d rather be thought of as Scottish or Irish, usually abroad people think Wales is part of England
Seems like we can’t convince the world otherwise so can we perhaps maybe just convince them we are part of the Scot-Ireland conglomeration that people seem to have decided exists
Probably the collapse of a digital learning system in Torfaen and Monmouthshire - the two councils left ~10,000 laptops [in storage for several years]
Not so much a national embarrassment, but in 2015 I went into a housing association call centre where they used systems that were coded before 1982
They managed around 50,000 homes on systems that only used monochrome monitors
Fair point
I suspect they were very likely outdated by the time they did see use, though
Microsoft [are actually housing server farms underwater] just so you know
Oh yeah in Welsh we have 'echddoe' for the day before yesterday and 'trannoeth' for the day after tomorrow
[Brynmawr Rubber Factory] certainly is interesting
I’m not sure what it’s history was, doubt it was built to be architecturally remarkable
Yes
Not sure why, I think it might be to prevent ignorance based racism maybe
I did a GCSE in it
We were taught about different issues and different religion's stances on them
It was actually really helpful in forming my own views on various issues
Tell him that the reason the Dutch are so tall is that historically all the short ones drowned so it’s customary to cross yourself and bless a glass of water before drinking it, in memory of the drowned
How did it go
Yes
Hahaha, thanks for answering
[St David's] just to screw with people
If practical considerations weren't an issue I'd go with Machynlleth or Caernarfon for historical reasons
Taking practical considerations into account Swansea is the only alternative really (maybe Newport too but that would be incrediblydepressing)
Eupen, then both the French speakers and Flemish speakers can unite in their disappointment and everybody loses equally as much
Based on the high school I attended in the 1990s:
I think we had to be on site from 8:30 - 8:40 or so
Registration was at 8:50 and lesson 1 started at 8:55
We had a 15 minute breaktime at 10:30
Lunchtime was from 12:00 to 12:50 and then there was a 5 minute registration session for the afternoon
Afternoon lessons were from 12:55 to 15:15
We had 9x 35-minute lessons a day, although most of those were 'double' lessons
The few times we had classes as single 35-minute lessons they were either language lessons (so German, French or Welsh), or more 'general' things like assemblies
We also had one 'tutor' period a week, where we're just with our form class for that lesson
We didn't get taught much then, it was a chance to catch up on homework and speak to your form tutor if you had any worries bout anything
Annoyingly, PE was also a single lesson (we also had a double 'Games' lesson once a week for team sports)
That’s the most Polish thing I’ve ever read
Thank you
> Socks and sandals
The 100% surefire way to spot Germans in the wild
[Canadian]
Probably the national parks like Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons
In terms of towns and cities I'd say Llandudno for North Wales
Not sure for South Wales but I'd guess at Cardiff maybe
Yeah
As soon as the whole pandemic and lock down eases I should look at going up Snowdon
Maybe next year now
One big difference is that the US states have stayed much the same since they were founded
Counties in the UK, particularly in England and Wales, have been through a restructuring of Local Government maybe 2 or 3 times since 1974, with several counties either merging and splitting during that time
It's only really an issue where some companies are using old postal address databases, and even then if the post code's right the mail usually gets to you OK
I always get mixed up with all the counties in the South Wales Valleys
No clue on Scotland, NI or London Boroughs but I've probably heard of most of them over the years
I didn't find German too bad, definitely easier than French
Welsh is the only other language I had to learn at school and I'd say that was the hardest of the 3 but not by too much
I imagine something like Russian, Arabic or Japanese is much harder but I've never attempted to learn those so I can't really comment on them
Yes
Wish we weren't leaving
Strange that the 1st non EU country I'll ever go to will be my own
Same
Feels weird
Not yet unfortunately
Would love to go someday, few friends of mine lived in Bergen and I've met a handful of Norwegians through the years but never been to Scandinavia let alone Norway
Its definitely on the bucket list
The anti-vaxx stuff basically started in the UK ~30 years ago with Andrew Wakefield
The conspiracies I see at the moment are Flat Earthers, and people who think 5G is going to immediately give us all cancer or something
Aye, that's a fair point
I still think of Wakefield as being responsible for the increase in anti-vaxxers since the 1990s.
> I don't know the translation of every plant or animal name
Ah, that's why you should always talk about fauna and flora in their Latin scientific names
It was a joke mate
Yeah, the tap water in Wales is safe to drink - and we pump some of it to Liverpool and Birmingham so you're probably OK to drink the water there, too
2nd home ownership
In a lot of rural coastal areas in West and North West Wales lots of houses in towns and villages are now owned by 2nd home owners (very often English)
This means that there is a big shortage of homes available for local people, especially younger people and for most of the year (winter especially) the towns are almost ghost towns
Also during the current crisis people have been travelling from the big cities in England to their second homes in Wales at night to avoid the police
Poznań is the first one that doesn't sound familiar, though there are plenty below it that do
Listen to the radio while driving and there are some good apps out there to learn the Welsh Language
I've always equated Finnish with someone trying to speak English after having a stroke
Yes most schools in Wales is now taught welsh as a secondary language
It depends really
Some people stopped once they finished school
I believe it was taught until the Welsh Not period started
Now it is picking up with speed again which is amazing
Roughly 1/3 of Wales can speak Welsh
Swansea and Cardiff are very low, perhaps 5% honestly (I live in both cities)
I learnt welsh for the first 16 years of my life, got a B in it at GCSE, then stopped and now I can’t even speak a sentence
It’s taught awfully here (I didn’t deserve a U grade let alone a B)
I dont live in the cities to be honest
But every time I've been to the two cities I have heard welsh being spoken
Most people where I live speak Welsh to each other
I think most people that you hear speaking Welsh in Cardiff/ Swansea/ Newport moved over from Carmarthenshire
Very few people that grew up here in the S/ SE can speak anything beyond very basic Welsh, unless they were lucky enough to go to a Welsh language school
Well theres no v, j, x or k in the Welsh alphabet so probably not
Well the Principal Area of Gwynedd has the highest percentage of its inhabitants able to speak Welsh and towns there include Bangor, Bala, Fairbourne, Harlech, Bethesda and Barmouth
All of which I don't think are too difficult to pronounce/ spell
Dont forget the whole thing about the pronunciation of ng, ll, dd, ff, ch, ph, th and rh
Because we live on an island, most Brits feel excluded (sort of)
We sometimes feel like the middle child of Europe, not forgotten but not as close to everyone
It’s really heartwarming to read all of these comments saying “togetherness” though
>If you leave the door open - were you born in a barn
My mum would say she's not heating the street if the front door was left open
There are two ceremonial 'offices' in the British Parliament that only exist because backbench MPs [cannot actually resign] instead they have to voluntarily disqualify themselves from sitting in Parliament
Yes:
[And Hereford]
Obviously all of these examples would break the law nowadays, at the least you'd probably be on a manslaughter charge if you tried it
Plus, if you're from North East Wales like me (Wrexham / Flintshire way), well we don't really have Welsh accents either
Welsh is completely phonetic and has two extra vowels then English
Meaning, Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch is easy to pronounce
Tŷ Bach - “little house” is probably the most common way of saying toilet here, especially in the south
Tŷ bach (small house), and lle chwech (six place
I don't really understand this one tbh)
Gestures broadly at entire language
For real though:
LlanfairPG, Chwyrligwgan
We have an absolute classic in Wales which is our longest placename: llanfairpwllgwyngylchgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
(And yes, those are four 'L's in a row that you are seeing there)
Squirrel seems to test people
When I found out Godmanchester was pronounced “Gumster” I just gave up
And English people say Welsh is hard to pronounce, least you just have to read the letters lol
Just some I can think of off the top of my head
Boi - means boy but around here at least people use it like “shwti boi” like “how’s it going mate”
Achan - apparently comes from “bachgen” meaningful boy so usually with male friends
I guess there butt and mun in South Wales but I don’t really know them
(Sorry I’ve only got two)
Wales has more castles per square mile than any other country in the world
I guess suspicion of poaching
Don't people in Europe just flash a card at a machine these days
I live right next to a small town with loads of Roman ruins
Theres Roman baths, Roman barracks, [an Amphitheatre] and they recently discovered a Roman port too
My school was next to the barracks and Amphitheatre so at luch time me and my friends used to eat on the Amphitheatre (once we were old enough that they let us out at lunchtime)
Wales has a couple dotted around the place, most of the significant ones seem to be in the South-East
Including the town of Caerleon near Newport that has a fairly extensive amphitheatre and bathhouse, interestingly enough Caerleon was reputed to be the location of King Arthur's capital: Camelot, although there are many places that claim to be the location of Camelot
It has to be either the remix of the traditional song 'sosban fach' in English 'little saucepan'  for honestly juat being a pure belter
Every Welsh language disco/school disco had this utter belter in it
Yeah, it's just an "Ireland" team in the 6N, NI and Ireland together
The other half are at an F1 race somewhere in the world, cheering on Max Verstappen
I know of it happening once near here
They had cctv footage and they posted it on the local Facebook group saying “We know who you are, please return our parcel by the end of the day, or we will contact the police”, and that did the trick
The delivery driver had hidden it but the person who stole it watched him hide it from across the road
Toulon
Went there for a summer holiday on the cheap a long while back and discovered why it was so cheap
Pretty sure they filmed any french film that needed to show a shithole in Toulon
Nothing but concrete, fumes, graffiti and monstrous apartment blocks from the 60s and the ghetto
My only memories from 4 days there are buying a dictionary as nowhere had a phrasebook, getting sunburn on the tops of my feet and persuading my girlfriend at the time to go topless on the beach
Bielefeld
Sounds a lot like what I've seen of Telford
Like the rest of the UK it costs about £9,000/year for us to go to uni
If you are an international student outside the EU it goes up to about £19,000/year
Before 2010 it was x3 cheaper but the government coalition bumped them up which is a shame as I started uni in 2012
Knowing that uni is free or cheap in other European countries is mind-boggling
Water, we got tons of the stuff
Good job the English own most of the reservoirs and pipe it to England so we see little of the money
Healthcare
I have the Unlimited plan from Three
Managed to get a MoneySavingExpert deal for £16 a month for 12 months
Nah I can assure you they're cheaper here
Love them
I'm the weirdo who will sometimes go outside in them for brief moments just so I can marvel at them
As long as I'm indoors
Yeah
I do, I dunno why but a thunderstorm at night with a bit of rain afterwards is oddly soothing to hear if you are inside and in bed
We have some good animal names:
Buwch Goch Gota --> Little Red Cow (Ladybird)
Mochyn Daear --> Earth Pig (hedgehog)
Bochdew --> fat cheeks (Hamster)
Mochyn Cwta --> Shirt Pig (guinea pig)
Siani flewog --> furry "Jenny" (Caterpillar)
Draenog --> thorny (Hedgehog)
Llygoden Fawr --> Big mouse (rat)
There's tons more but I can't think of any others other than animals so here's some idioms
Rhoi'r ffidl yn y to --> put the fiddle in the roof (give up)
Llyncu Mul --> swallow a donkey (to sulk)
Mae'n bwrw hen wragedd a ffyn --> it's raining old ladies and sticks[like a walking stick] (it's raining cats and dogs
"Hwyl fawr (hoil va-wuh) " is used to say goodbye but literally translates to "big fun".
You’d think welsh, being old brittonic/being so intertwined with english wouldn’t be like this
but;
Buwch Goch Gota (ladybird/ladybug) = “Short red cow”
Bochdew (Hamster) = “Fat cheeks”
Dant y llew (Dandelion) = “Lion’s Tooth”
Drewgi (Skunk) = “Smelly dog”
Gwas y neidor (dragonfly) = “Snake’s servant”
Tŷ bach (toilet) = “Little house”
Pysgod Wibli Wobli (jellyfish) =“Wibbly Wobbly fish”
Popty Ping (Microwave) = “The oven that goes ping” or “ping-oven”
How I would say it (semi fluent Welsh)
Helo, fy enw i ydy John, mae'n bleser i weld ti
lle wyt ti'n dod o?
Hello, my name is John
It's a pleasure to see you
Where do you come from
Your Welsh is fine but I'd usually say "mae'n bleser I weld chi" with strangers
same age strangers = generally chi
Friends, family and people you know well = ti
Talking to teachers or people with authority = chi
Anyone older than you, unless you're friends = chi
Some people, especially older people, might get offended but if you're a learner I doubt they'd care
If you're fluent and address as ti they might take it as a sign of disrespect
I don't really know
I think it's quite similar to Tu / Vous in French
Cows generally leave people be, unless they have a dog
Wild boar in the forest of Dean could be dangerous
Holey, anyway
> The EU flag is something that occasionally pops up on construction site tables telling you this site was partly funded by the EU
But no one would bother flying this flag for any occasion whatsoever
Pretty much the same here, in my experience, and I expect even that is on its way out now
Human traffic
Twin town
[Les Convoyeurs Attendant] for Belgium
Hedd Wyn
I believe it's on YouTube with English subtitles
Hedd Wyn for Wales
Great film that shows Welsh culture prior to ww1 and the tragic story of the pacifict bard forced into war
What ya waiting for
Ze Germans
Was going to put this myself
As far as I know it’s on YouTube too
That's a TV series ain't it
We got it over here as a TV series anyhow
Yes
Filth is fucking fantastic
It had me in fits of laughter all the way through the film tbh
"You're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece
Apparently the best thing to do is cut up a corpse into six pieces and pile it all together
" And when you got your six pieces, you gotta get rid of them, because it's no good leaving it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, now is it
Then I hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs
You got to starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped-up body will look like curry to a pisshead
You gotta shave the heads of your victims, and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggies' digestion
You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don't want to go sievin' through pig shit, now do you
They will go through bone like butter
You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm
They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes
That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute
Hence the expression, "as greedy as a pig"."
Worst I can think of from wales is Welsh rarebit, which is basically cheese on toast with mustard, but that’s more based on the controversy of mustard haha
Also I make mine vegan which almost everybody seems to think is disgusting for some reason haw
Not breakfast, but perfectly justifiable for second breakfast
There are no deep coal mines left and the steelworks are clinging on with a couple of thousand workers
It's hard to explain what people do for a living now
A Welsh man created the National Health Service so everyone can see a doctor for free
There's a Welsh Senedd in Cardiff (which became the capital city)
There's a Welsh language TV station (that's like radio with pictures)
We're still part of the UK unlike most of Ireland
I mean you won't get beaten for speaking Welsh anymore so that's nice
"Going to Cardiff
Your horse is probably quicker than the train"
Cycling still the most convenient way to get around but the roads have more potholes
I think it's [Cwm] (roughly pronounced 'coom')
We have a lot of 3-letter place names like Van and Wig
We also have places named Cwm (also known as corrie) everywhere, but my favourite would be Tŵr in Anglesey, the same island on which Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch lies
Box, in Carmarthenshire
Cil, in Montgomeryshire
Cog, in Glamorgan
Cwm, virtually everywhere
Ely, in Glamorgan
Ham, in Glamorgan
Hem, in Montgomeryshire
Lon, in Merioneth
Pit, in Monmouthshire
Ton, in Monmouthshire
Twr, in Anglesey
Usk, in Monmouthshire
Van, in Montgomeryshire
Van, in Glamorgan
Wig, in Montgomeryshire
We have a few towns twinned with French towns for soke reason, my tiny add village is paired with a French one too
Thanks for that
Ely is probably the 'big' one I missed there
My version was Russian spoken backwards, surely Russians should be the drunk ones
Although vinho verde does creep up on you
Yup
Welsh - I tend to stumble over my words and stutter as I did growing up, especially having forgotten such a chunk of it
English - more natural and relaxed so it sounds normal
Spanish (learning it) - More abrupt to match the language style with a lot of "umm" and "errrr" while I try and remember the next parts of the sentence I want to say
I don't know if it's just me but unless around kids or elderly, most people swear in English to the point they don't really have any meaning, and I'm fairly sure it's my native language
I've heard someone say that swearing in English isn't quite as taboo as it used to be but there are still some words that are very taboo and essentially swear words, most of them being slurs
Then again, I am a teenager so maybe it's just not as taboo amongst my age group
I'd say the general sentiment towards Cardiff in Wales is positive
I think it's a great city
I would however say that there is a perception up here in the North of Wales that Cardiff gets most of the investment - sort of like the "London vs the rest of the UK" sentiment
Yeah, fair
My friends and I do look forward to a day down to Cardiff though
I've always had a great time there
I feel it would be remissed not to mention how "Back to Basics" ended, with the death of [Stephen Milligan]
I'd like to thank England for inventing the train, the world wide web, and the game of Rugby Union
I can't blame you, it was raining heavily here at 9pm
Yes, Tim Berners-Lee (an English computer scientist) was one of the key architects of the WWW
He actually worked with [Robert Cailliau] on the system
It seems as if his Belgian colleague's role has rather been forgotten now, sadly
So I'll say thanks to Belgium too
the what now
You're welcome
We generally save the bitching for rugby matches against you these days :P
The train as a mode of transport, yes
The Pacer - **ish**.
Rural lines like my local one would probably have closed if not for the development of the Pacer and the later conversion of [regional trains] to [single-car units] suitable for rural areas
Yeah, that's fair enough
Yeah, I'll make jokes about Pacers all day long, but the one thing I will always defend them for is keeping the rural lines open
If you want to give your kid a traditional Welsh name, there's an ap for that
Cain- the first murderer
Judas-the traitor
Those names are literally synonymous with the crimes committed by historical/mythical figures
Like here in the UK if you referred to someone as Judas you would be implying they had committed some form of betrayal, I assume it's the same in Spain too
Much the same logic as with Hitler and genocide, just different crimes
*Exactly* the same with Welsh
I went to English-medium schools, so it was usually a register of Welsh (you know, the boring things that adults talk about), that nobody in class would have been able to understand
We did learn Welsh from the age of about 5, maybe earlier, but it was slow going in a class of 30
Didn't really pick up until secondary
Thinking back to it, maybe about 30-40% of my teachers could have been native speakers judging by their accents, so it's quite impressive to think back that every teacher I remember was fluent
That is very true, yes
You must however understand that children only devote their brains to a language when it has immediate utility to their lives, and won’t simply adopt it and begin using it through a classroom setting
I had the same experience with Welsh myself
I did also speak a third language at home, and picked it up much more easily because it was useful to my everyday life - children talk about the food they want to eat, the shows they watch on TV, what they do with their friends
In Wales, kids enjoy sweets with English brand names, watch English television and movies, and more than likely speak English with their friends, often even in Welsh-majority areas
Welsh seemed a bit dry to me as a kid, and a significant portion of my early Welsh education was just songs, presumably because they’re easy to memorise through repetition, and to help non-natives get the pronunciation right
Now, of course, I wish my Welsh was better, since it’s a very beautiful language, and in some sense rings through my heart like a native tongue - it’s the sound of home
However, whenever I do speak it, it often gets the response “sorry, I don’t speak Welsh”. It’s absolutely fine if someone doesn’t, but defaulting to English just makes every short exchange quicker as a result
Again, lack of utility discourages use, and in Ireland it’s the same relationship: (practically) nobody who speaks Welsh/Irish fluently doesn’t also speak English
English is, in every practical sense, the language spoken in both countries
It’s not the same as if Austrian children started speaking English and “didn’t seem to want to learn their own language”; their own language in that case would by-and-large be German, and their own languages in the case of Wales and Ireland are English
Nevertheless, of course, there is an *incredibly* strong relationship between Welsh and the Welsh national identity; “*O bydded i’r hen iath barhau
*”. In some respects, that might encourage its use, but if you are not *considered* Welsh, it does not then constitute ‘your’ language
I associated Welsh very strongly with an ugly form of Welsh nationalism as a teenager
Welsh national identity is very absorptive as far as nations go, but enough people tell you you’re one of ‘the English’, even if you’re not, and that association builds quickly
That does not represent the entirety of the Welsh-speaking community, nor Wales, my home, and a place which I love, but it nevertheless left its impression on me in a time where I was coming to revile the rise of all forms of nationalism in the UK
I understand better now that there are qualitative differences between these nationalisms, but I am nevertheless still opposed to the concept
Now in Ireland, this problem is presumably less common, at least in the Republic, but in the end the number of speakers is so few that the other hurdles are far larger
With each of the ones I described, by the time you reach your twenties, you have a job/studying to worry about, and you want to switch your brain off in the evenings and go out on the weekends with your friends
Only the most devoted are going to spend their free time learning Irish, the same is true of Welsh if you don’t already speak it by then
The only caveat is that many jobs do require some level of Welsh, though the incentive to learn it for that reason is dampened by the fact that a native speaker will almost always be more elegance for the job
So, though it is lamentable, I completely understand why people on the island of Ireland don’t learn Irish, even if many may well ‘want’ to
In Wales, I believe the retention in young second language speakers is going up, I assume based on a few changes in teaching practices
Hopefully Ireland can do the same and achieve full bilingualism, because Irish too is a beautiful language
Of course the biggest barrier in both cases is English
People travel from all over the world to these places because they have some English ability
I can guarantee that nobody moves to Ireland because they speak Irish
These pull factors mean that anyone who hasn’t spent their childhoods in either country must either learn an obscure language with a high amount of geographic specificity, or learn/use one of the most widely spoken languages in history
People don’t pick option one
However, on a final more optimistic note, our small town accepted about 20 Syrian refugees c.2016
I would sit in on a few of their Welsh lessons which were held in a community building I would often revise in
When the opportunity to learn something is free, and you are given support, encouragement, and accepted into a community, great things happen, and the most brilliantly rare cultural crossroads can emerge
I think all of them ended up speaking better Welsh than me
Yes, Y Wladfa
There was a film we watched about it in class called ‘Patagonia’, named after the region
Not to be too cruel but i think france would probably smell of garlic and stinky cheese
Add to that the smell of peat and nitrate fertiliser and i think you have nailed the smell of ireland
Dandelion and burdock
Nah
Id say more a apple smell
Especially come late summer early autumn, in counties like Somerset and herefordshire
When I was about five or six I saw a map of Europe and spent a few months convinced that Turkey was "in the bottom-right corner of the world".
Well, I just learned that Dunkirk is not Scottish
Wasn't sure exactly what it was, but I had a vague idea that it blocked radio signals somehow
A girl moved to my school from England around year 4 and I remember her being shocked that Wales wasn’t a separate island, especially since she had crossed over using the Severn bridge
Perhaps it’s fairly common with people from island nations
Oof harsh aha
"Prepare the gangway, gentlemen
That Honda shall make a grand prize for the Admiralty
It depends, if you are in a social situation, say down the pub with ya mates then sure swear all you like
But swearing infront of kids or old people is big no no
Honestly ya best bet would be to just use common sense, if the situation is social one, then sure, if it's a more formal one or one where there are old people and kids then I'd avoid swearing if possible
Generally it isn't that big a deal but as with all things you gotta pick your times carefully
a = and
i = to
o = from
y = the
e = him
What first comes to mind is the word I, meaning to, and a, meaning and
Why, how much do you earn
Wales is officially bilingual
About a quarter of the population claim to be able to speak Welsh (the number varies depending on the source, the most accurate source is the census which was 9 years ago, so possibly out of date)
Pretty much everyone who speaks Welsh as their first language can speak English fluently from a relatively young age
Welsh is compulsory in English medium schools and English is compulsory in Welsh medium schools (although the standard of Welsh in English medium schools is lower than the standard of English at Welsh medium schools)
Those who go to English medium schools have to learn Welsh pretty much from the start of education until the age of 16 but many leave still not being able to speak anything beyond the very basics
All road signs are bilingual and official letters from the Welsh Government/ council are also bilingual
Theres a Welsh language TV channel (S4C) and Welsh language Radio station (BBC Radio Cymru)
Often non Welsh speakers will tune in for football/ rugby that is beind a pay wall for English language commentary but freely available in Welsh
Letters from the NHS are bilingual, too
Also, at large railway stations, the Welsh announcements are made first
Yep, student finance Wales letters too
Basically anything 'official'
Bear in mind that the 'quarter of people' figure is from the [2011 UK Census] so that figure is largely self-reported
If anything, data suggested the number of people who speak Welsh is declining slightly
Generally for the UK I'd say it's pretty much expected that a lot of kids will start walking to school by ages 10 or 11, they'll have been taught road safety by then and are encouraged to walk in groups
Age 10-11 would be the last year of Primary School, and 11-12 the first year of Secondary School
You often hear of kids in London who use public transport, so from age 11 their journey to school could involve catching a bus or train to school several miles away, maybe even changing trains en route
There is a set threshold for when kids can use a school bus:
>All children between 5 and 16 qualify for free school transport if they go to their nearest suitable school and live at least:
> * 2 miles from the school if they’re under 8
> * 3 miles from the school if they’re 8 or older
Don't think I've seen any kids walking alone at that age in the UK - I know I was still being walked to and from school by my Mum, Grandmother or an Aunt at that age
As /u/EmeraldIbis says a lot of kids don't go to town 'alone' until they're 13 or 14, and even then they're often in groups of 2 or 3
Unfortunately a few high-profile murders did rather reinforce the idea that there's a paedophile 'around every corner', for example [Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman]
I’m not even fluent in modern Welsh, but I usually understand writing if I take my time
Looking at old Welsh it’s nearly incomprehensible, until I scrolled down and read how it was written then
The orthography is significantly different, with there being no use of “ll” and “dd” to represent their sounds and with u and w both being represented by u. It was a little clearer after that
It was further confused by the inclusion of snippets of Latin, so I couldn’t start to imply meaning from the sentence because another language I didn’t know was in the middle
Common Brittonic, the pre-cursor to Welsh (and Cumbric, Cornish and Breton), was spoken across Britain
There’s no real written sources to read, but it was likely fairly similar to Old Welsh
Modern Cornish and Breton are very similar to Welsh in vocabulary and sentence structure
Cumbric sadly died out around 200-300 years ago, but in its prime was spoken in the North East of England and Southern Scotland, hence some place names still being Celtic, like Carlisle, which clearly has the prefix Car, which in Welsh is Caer, meaning fort
In Welsh, Carlisle is Caerliwel(ydd), I’ve bracketed the ydd as this more clearly demonstrates the similar part of the name
One major difference between Welsh and Cumbria is the -ydd suffix sometimes present in place names
This is clear too with Derwent, which in Welsh is Derwennydd
A fluent Welsh speaker, who had maybe put a few hours into understanding the evolution of Welsh, would likely be able to converse with a person from around 500AD in most parts of Britain
There would be some difficulty but most of the core vocabulary seems to have been maintained, since a number of nouns are latin based
For example “ffenestr” for window
Huh, a few of those words do look remarkably Welsh, Credo and ym for example are Welsh words, even now aha
Definitely just a coincidence though
Also not fluent but can understand a fair bit of [this lullaby]  in 7th century Cumric, including counting in Welsh and Cumbric
Only one I can remember is me and an English friend were in a supermarket in a non-touristy part of Munich having a weird argument about which beers we should’ve bought and making stupid jokes, the lady in from passed us one of the divider things to put between shopping at the till
Said danke and she said in English I’m English too it’s nice to listen to you guys and we had to try and remember if we’d said anything about her
I’m struggling to find any exact data
I would (half educated) guess:
Now: Cardiff
1900: Cardiff
1800: Swansea or Merthyr
1700: Swansea
Merthyr
1600:...Swansea
Machynlleth
Aberystwyth
Not including the bike
"Cyntaf i'r felin caiff falu" (First to the mill gets the grind) First come first served
"Ar y gweill" (On the (knitting) needles) In progress

"Paid â chodi pais ar ôl piso" (Don't lift your petticoat AFTER pissing) Don't lock the stable door after the horse has bolted
"Mae e'n gwybod hyd ei gyrn" (He knows the length of his horns) He knows his limits

There is a [Welsh Language Commissioner] - although they are mainly concerned with ensuring that Welsh has equal status alongside English here in Wales
This was [made law in 2011] Welsh Language \(Wales\) Measure 2011/Pages/The-Welsh-Language-\(Wales\)-Measure-2011
aspx), and updated in 2016
I really wish I had a more accessible and affordable way to learn Welsh
Dad's Welsh but I grew up in America so unfortunately never got to learn
Now that I live here I feel obliged to learn
Duolingo and learnwelsh
cymru are great free tools
Learn at your own pace and you can check for local lessons as well
I know what you mean
Mum's side of the family all speak Welsh, but we're up here in the North East which is a much more English speaking area of Wales
It wasn't taught particularly well in school (IMO), certainly when I compare it to French or German lessons
I really should have got into Duolingo when this whole lockdown started though
Yeah Duo is great but I do better in a classroom setting where I can actually have someone tell me how I'm progressing
Hopefully I can find something when this all ends
Wales’ whole coastline is pretty cool
There’s a path around the whole thing so it’s pretty good to walk around and see different beaches
If you are by the coast you are never more than 20 minutes from a very good beach
Near me for example is [southerndown beach] used as “Bad Wolf Bay” in Doctor Who
A little further West from me there are brilliant beaches
[Barafundle bay] [Three Cliffs Bay] and [Tenby] all spring to mind
There are great beaches in the north too but I’ve not had the chance to visit
[Porth Iago] and [Aberdovey] are two I’d like to go to
I think a few people know Wales has good beaches, especially in the U.K., but as far as I’m aware they don’t really have an international reputation
[Rhossili Bay] is another good one on the Gower Peninsula
When I was younger we went to Morfa Bychan / [Black Rock Sands] and [Rhosneigr] for summer holidays, they're good beaches too
Yeah, honestly there’s so many to pick from
I have one 2 minutes from my front door that’s good and nice and quiet, not going to link to that one though lol
I don't blame you
I mean that all depends on how close the door is to the beach in the first place but yes I would not live on the actual beachfront lol
Definitely Cardiff and Swansea for Wales, Capital and second city
Big footballing rivalry too
Abertawe (Swansea) and Caerdydd (Cardiff)
Definitely agree to Manchester-Liverpool if we're talking about the whole UK though
They're very close to each other, they're the 2 biggest cities, and they're quite different despite being kind of similar
I think the rivalry really only got heated with the rise of football hooliganism in the 80s, though
They're our only proper big cities too, anyway xD
Along with Newport, aye
There are [4 dialects of Welsh] 5 if you include the version spoken in Patagonia
In most of Britain, it's generallu easy to tell what town/city someone comes from by the slang they use and the subtle accent they have
A little bit like the Netherlands I suppose, just less drastic
The UK famously does, someone with a good ear can pinpoint a person’s origin within a radius of about 40km I’d say
Never realised that before
If someone asked I just would have said two: De and the Gogs
Yeah, me too
Yeah, I thought it was just separate North Wales and South Wales dialects
Brexit
Welsh Remain voters don't exist, apparently
Or so most of the UK subreddits have been telling me for the past 3 years
THIS
People need to understand Wales as a nation
[A large proportion of Wales (20% or so) were born in England] and generally those English people living in Wales are older (Wales has suffered from a brain drain for generations)
Furthermore, older people generally voted to leave (which the data kind of backs up -  - look at Conwy & Pembrokeshire which are traditional seaside resorts and have a large, older population, and compare that with Gwynedd which has a university town and a much younger, native population) so apparently even though *Wales* voted to leave, it could be a reasonable argument to make that the *Welsh* did not
Yeah, that's a fair point
Too late to do anything about it all now though
I will say that I think the lack of a "Welsh Daily Mail" etc, for want of a better paper, certainly didn't help us as the domestic Welsh media is quite weak compared to Scotland's.
Yes, good point
That doesn't help the overall Brexit argument either
I can see why a lot of Scots are pissed off, particualrly after the result of the Independence referendum in 2014
I can't blame Brexit on just the English when 52% of us voted the same way here in Wales, but I think our weaker regional media really didn't help there either
The penny is 'starting to drop' round my village, but most people are 3 years too late now sadly
I don't think the 20% of English born people really tipped it tbh, I think the 80% of the Welsh were not helped by our media
It didn't really explain the positives of the EU, many people just dismissed the cash we got as building roads to nowhere and all that
Scotland has its own editions of the Daily Mail, Sun etc
We have very little local media and most people will buy a 'British' Sun or Mirror over the Daily Post / Western Mail
So we were getting more of Gove / Farage / BoJo than anyone speaking up for Wales IMO
EDIT: obviously the 80 / 20 % of the population doesn't include the under 18s etc
I personally voted to Remain
For what its worth I think our weaker regional media here in Wales didn't do much to speak up for the benefits of the EU
It's all far too late now mind you
Some of us did, sadly
Unsurprisingly, Welsh
I think it’s offered in schools in Patagonia, specifically in the Yr Wladfa area of Chubut Province (Argentina), and then Wales
Maybe some of the border primary schools
My friend from a village on the border in Gloucester had Eisteddfods, which are very Welsh
But in generally the opportunity to study and ‘learn’ Welsh is predominantly in Wales
We did home economics at my school (about 10 years ago now) it was part of “DT” which is supposed to be design and technology
For one term we did home economics, mostly cooking but also some budgeting stuff, textiles which was sewing and fabrics for one term and then woodworking and digital designing for the other term
Was very useful imo and should’ve had another few hours a week
Kind of
Chepstow is a town directly on the border with England, the entirety of the town centre is on the Welsh side of the river Wye but the suburbs go over the river into the English side
Technically I think they are classed as different villages but they are effectively suburbs of Chepstow
[Knighton] in Powys is similar
Most of the town is in Wales, the border actually cuts through the town slightly so the railway station is actually in England
My favourite example is Chester FC
Their stadium is in a suburb of Chester that's close to the Welsh border
In fact [the pitch is actually on the Welsh side of the border]
Iceland maybe
It's my go to 'border fact' :P
Men of Harlech is pretty anti-English
It's got a fair few different versions, however all but 2 (the zulu one and the woad one) revolve around defeating the barbarian Saxon's in battle
Coming from Wales, where faggots are a type of food,it took me way to long to understand that lyric as a child
[Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch] - apparently the longest place name in Europe
The locals just call it Llanfair or Llanfair PG
The name was lengthened specifically to attract tourism in Victorian times
It translates roughly as "St Mary's Church in the Hollow of the White Hazel near a Rapid Whirlpool and the Church of St
Tysilio near the Red Cave".
Ironically the platforms at the railway station are [too short to comply with social distancing guidelines] so the station is  temporarily closed now
One we might win
Safe to say we win this perticular one
It’s actually 51 letters because “ll” and “ch” are considered single letters in the Welsh language
IIRC there's a fast-flowing part of a river nearby or something
Yes, basically that
I believe the actual reason is an operational one
There isn't enough room to get two sets of [train doors] at either end of the car open, so the Guard can't keep themselves distant from the passengers
I think so, but IIRC they're all on the 'mainland' side of Wales nearer Bangor
I was in the early stages of planning a train tour of some European cities I've not visited as yet
I'd got as far as Hamburg, Berlin, Poznan, Warsaw
Once lockdown ends it's going to depend on the time of year
Given that I can't take time off in term time I likely won't get away until winter, in which case it could be Funchal in Madeira or Las Palmas in Gran Canaria
Lisbon is a nice city, but personally I think Lisboa is better
Estonian and Lithuanian are the furthest away that I've seen here, though Polish, Irish and Dutch numberplates are the most common foreign plates to see here
I've seen a car on Ukrainian licence plates in one of the towns on Lake Maggiore in Italy
That's gotta be around a 2000km drive
Ireland
Scotland
Germany
Depends on the sport
In rugby normally Japan or Italy
In soccer, Iceland or Italy (or whoever is playing England)
In hockey, I tend to follow Team Canada (Wales don’t have an ice hockey team and I only semi follow GB hockey, more into the club game though)
I find Kaliningrad fascinating
My first thoughts
My second thoughts
These next few days are gonna be rough
Trust me, it ain't worth it lol
England trying to do an Edward Longshanks 2: Electric Boogaloo
England, again
England
Not like it hasn't happened before
[Euros Childs - Cwtsh]
We just got [Yma o Hyd] (meaning Still Here in English) to the top of the iTunes UK charts the other week
In my opinion it's a great song and totally deserves to be up there, but outside of Wales no one will likely ever hear it
Hagrid had a Southwestern accent actually, like a farmer
I never did
We just brought what we needed for each day
We only had lockers available when we were in 6th form which is the final two (non-compulsory) years of school
Even then there was a like 1/2 pound deposit for the key
I never bothered with one though
It was annoying on days in younger years when you had like catering and PE on the same day, or just needed a lot of stuff for one day, but it was never the end of the world
Some people used to just get huge bags and take everything for school everyday, but usually you would only need like 3-5 books and then it’s pens/pencils
Nope, I don't think any of the secondary schools in my area have them (could be wrong though)
We had to carry everything with us in a rucksack and it could get heavy if you had to bring in a lot of things that particular day
Like 6-7 books at most, I think
As far as I can remember, any big textbooks were just kept in the classrooms instead of being taken away by students
I only really felt overloaded on days when I had my PE kit too
Cool flag / fake funny words (Contrary to popular belief , Popty ping is NOT microwave in Welsh)
All of our castles
Hmm, I'm going to haphazardly guess Crete or the Basque country
They are, but we have either the most per area or the most per population
I can't remeber which but Slovakia has the other statistic I think
We have the most per square mile I believe
Seams to be the done thing on our isles tbf
Would you rather I used the term British isles
I was trying to be polite
C'mon we're all celts here
Exactly
Jesus
I forgot how tetchy the Irish can be on here
lol
Yeah sadly that definitely seams the case
I know most of ya guys over the Irish sea are decent reasonable folk, I never doubt that for a second but ya definitely do have a few prats out there who seam intent on having a barny online
Sad that tbh
No problem west Britian
I've always thought we look like a bank robber (England) with the mask still hanging off their head (Scotland) and a bag of money under their arm (Wales), running up some stairs (France/Belgium/Netherlands)
And I guess they also have a ghost sidekick (Ireland)
Not gonna lie, this is starting to sound like a cartoon, and I'd watch it
Huh, so it does
Though he could also have just dropped something into Cardigan Bay and is trying to reach down to catch it
Well the only Welsh language song to ever make the UK charts is [Yma O Hyd - Dafydd Iwan] which made the charts at the start of this year despite being 40 years old
As far as I know there isn't a Welsh language specific music chart (I could well be wrong though) so other than that I don't know
Yeah I gathered this from my Northern friends at uni
We actually had an “Anything but the south social” which was Welsh, Irish, Scottish and Northern society
Was a good laugh and fun to get away from the main demographic for a while
Isn't Vilnius the capital
That is the main demographic at my uni though since I’m in uni in the south, I see how that wasn’t clear though
I believe it was the Northern society’s idea
They’re originally a Celtic people group like Irish Scottish and Welsh (Manx too), and their language, which only a few hundred speak and not natively though the revival is growing, is very closely related to Welsh and Breton
They have a few Celtic traditions and whenever I’ve been on holiday there they are very welcoming on hearing Welsh people, apparently significantly more than a southern English person, especially if they are buying a second home there
I believe they recently introduced some sort of ban on second homes there somewhere
Not one of these groups are the same either tbf, but I see what you mean, cider country is a little different, and somewhere else on reddit today I was talking about the Celtic origins of Cornwall
Yeah I only really knew about it originally from going there, and my mum saying they are like Welsh people
I looked into the history more recently and it’s pretty interesting
I lived at home until 18, and come home for fairly long periods when there’s breaks from university
If I brought a one night stand over I’d probably get mocked a lot and maybe asked not to do it
When I had a girlfriend we were given privacy (we were about 16/17)
We still were cautious about it because there was always a chance if someone knocking on the door to come in
They knew what was happening and must’ve been okay with it, but we never had a clear conversation about it
I'm 22 and still live at home
I've never been in a relationship or brought anyone home, and personally I wouldn't want to just because of how awkward it would be
However I don't think my parents would really care if I was in a relationship and they had already met them, unless I was being too loud
In fact they'd probably be relieved at this point
Barry Town Council threatened to take Tim Martin to the Court of Chivalry, after a [JD Wetherspoon pub in the town was refurbished, and they incorporated a coat of arms into the pub carpet]
> When they abolished a load of quangos (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations) in 2010 there were some spectacular losses, including the Hearing Aid Council and the Horserace Totalisator Board
That cull killed off [Becta] which I still have mixed feelings over
They were at least useful for being able to go onto their website and finding briefing notes you could print off and hand to head teachers etc, when your school was considering buying something like a [Virtual Learning Environment]
Now
Every school does their own thing in terms of IT procurement
You end up having no two schools locally using the same system, so you can't even phone someone in the next town over and ask how, say, Google Suite is working out for them
I really like [Hen Wlad fy Nhadau] its beautiful and makes me proud to be Welsh every time I hear it
God Save the Queen can fuck off
I like it, it describes the county and that we're loyal to it
I only know Gwlad Gwlad off the top of my head
I like it though
It's the only song I really belt out
makes me proud aswell
I think we do better in sports games because of the anthem, it's awesome
Definitely
Wearing a Wales jersey means so much more for Welsh sportspeople than it does for the English
Thats rugby players for you
OK, this won't be in a dictionary, but the colloquial word for microwave is popty ping
Oven = popty, lit
Bake House, microwave popty ping
Animal names in Welsh are funny
We have Buwch Goch Gota lit
Little Red Cow (ladybird/bug)
Pili pala = butterfly
Bochdew "Fat Cheek" (Hamster)
Mouse is Llygoden, rat is Llygoden Fawr (big mouse)
Then there's mwg drwg "naughty smoke" (cannabis)
The Welsh word for Jellyfish is quite cute:
Pysgod Wibli Wobli
Wibbly Wobbly fish :D
Primary schools in the UK have been calling insects "Minibeasts" for about the past 30 years, which just annoys me unnecessarily
I prefer cont-y-môr! Also cont-y-bin (wasp) and cont-yr-awyr (seagull)
Yup, "mae'r popty ping yn popio popgorn tan mae e'n mynd yn bing"
Welsh needs no help in annoying learners, believe me
Not as far as I know
But I did some digging and it seems they're called God's Little Cow in some slavic languages
Also, weren't they farmed like cows on Mars in Futurama
All true wonders of Cymraeg
The commercial is all bright primary colours, with kids smashing the toys together and the scene changes every three seconds
I can picture it now
Oh, I'd forgotten oblong
I think the proper word is meicrodon, no where near as exciting
Though it does sound like a very small member of the mafia
Yeah that's right, ton = wave, meicrodon = micro wave
I also like meicrosglod (microchip)
I went down an Internet rabbithole and returned with [this]
"Liverpool is a football club" and "Liverpool are a football club" both sound fine to me, for some reason
Some things seem interchangeable like that, others don't.
Most natives seem to do that too
I'm always a little tempted to pronounce "Beethoven" as "Beef Oven" just to annoy people
To me, that's got a similar feeling to "the trouble", except it sounds more like you're talking about one of a known *group* of "Troubles" instead of a single standalone thing
But yeah, the normal phrasing would be either "trouble" or "some trouble".
The Government has seats on one side of the House (the left as the TV cameras look at it), and all other parties sit opposite, as per [this diagram]
Honestly
Just speaking Welsh is a word game
SOME consonants at the beginning of words change in certain grammatical situations
A C can change to a G, a CH or NGH
The capital is Cardiff (Caerdydd) ...
I live in Cardiff
**Dwi'n byw yng Nghaerdydd**
I am going to Cardiff
**Dwi'n mynd i Gaerdydd**
I have lived in Penarth and Cardiff
**Dw i wedi byw ym Mhenarth a Chaerdydd**
Endless fun
Especially looking stuff up in the dictionary
Luckily, someone has now figured out a [shortcut]
Like in English we sometimes admit to having Betty Swollocks to keep it polite
Well Welsh has official status in Wales, equal to English
All public services must be available bilingually etc
Its use differs area to area
Generally the further you get from the capital, the higher the chance of hearing it
It is the de-facto language of my workplace  and I have friends with kids who will only learn English when they start school
It'll be interesting to see census data next year compared to 2011 because living next door to England is a pretty rough environment for any minority language in which to survive, but survive it does
The unity of the tribes and the establishment of the kingdom of Wales
Then we would have had a chance to fight against the english properly
I would probably have to say the Glyndŵr Revolt at the beginning on the 15th century because, although it is not certain, Wales would probably have become independent from England whilst including all the things Glyndŵr himself wanted for Wales such as 2 universities, an updated version of the laws of Hywel Dda from the 9th-10th centuries and a Welsh parliament  among other things
These were fairly big things for a small country to have, and if he had succeeded, which he came really close to might I add, Wales might still have be independent today
Have Henry Percy wait for Glyndŵr’s forces at the Battle of Shrewsbury and win the battle, splitting England in 2 and securing an independent Wales
Even if it didn’t last, it would have expanded Wales’ borders and given us a much more powerful voice within a British context
Either that or the Miner’s Strike
Our stupid inheritance laws really fucked us over
I agree with all the Glyndŵr / Independence posts, but if we're talking coal and Wales, preventing Aberfan would top my list there
Absolutely agree with that
Yeah
But for a few hours either way and the school would have been empty
Not exclusively, plenty will walk on the right but now you've mentioned it I guess I do tend to keep left most of the time
In britain in the 17th century there where the highwaymen
They where simular to outlaws in the US that they would hold stage coaches and rob wealthy travelers on their travels
The most famous example being dick turpin
In many ways they where the antecedents of the american outlaws in the old west era
Neither was poland
In fairness France was a vanquished occupied nation so I don't think it would have been right to invite the French
It would be nice for the UK to have a *decent* high-speed rail network like you see in France, Germany or Italy
It wouldn't be ideal for rural areas though, I think a more 'comprehensive' rail network like Switzerland's would be better suited to many parts of Wales
Also, embrace the concept of running trains and buses to more rural areas because they're a *public service*, and not just a way to cream profits off and make shareholders richer
Yup, my local line is one train in each direction per hour
Even getting that to one train each way every 30 minutes would be a major improvement
Yeah, I know what you mean
The equivalent local train prices in Italy are so low by comparison, we usually have to make sure that we've bought enough return tickets for the family
It's bloody daft given the more attractive rail franchises are the Intercity ones with flash new trains, as opposed to the rural ones
Councils can't just stop maintaining the minor A or B road through your village because part of the M1 is more important
True, GWR is an outlier here
Countryfile isn't that militant
Yet
Wales never really developed historically famous liquors
There’s Penderyn Whiskey now which is very well acclaimed
I don’t really drink enough whiskey to tell you, but people seem to enjoy it
There’s some Welsh Gins becoming famous too, but I can’t think of them off the top of my head
Beer was and is the drink of Wales, which is obviously not a liquor
Brains Beer and Wrexham Lager are quite famous and have been about for over a hundred years I believe
There’s a huge craft beer and cider scene now with companies like Tiny Rebel and Gwynt y Ddraig becoming big around the U.K. and smaller ones like Tenby Brewing and Glamorgan Brewing Company making stuff too
Edit: Typos
It’s good, often very strong
I struggle to drink any having been to cider festivals since I was about 15 and drinking far too much of it, just makes me feel sick now sadly

Also, comparing everything in r/soccer to an American equivalent
Anyone: "A club the size of Man Utd should really be aiming to win the league
American #1: "For context, we have a local NFL franchise here in Dallas, and they haven't won a divisional championship since 19blahblah
American #2: "But they came close in 2001 when they had Durk Manyguns as quarter-back
They beat us (Yanktown Wankers) in the quarter-divisional south championship
American #1: "Yeah, you guys have Butch Flagsonshirt at long-back, your roster is stacked

OH SHUT UP
I never knew what WC stood for but I just assumed it would be used across the Atlantic as well lol
Maybe it was some weird Latin phrase

Our measurement systems are fucked
Stones for weight of a person, g/kg for anything else
Miles for distance, but also metres

Feet and inches for height but cm and m for pretty much everything else
What the fuck is going on
I didn't have to scroll far to see an uplifting story about several first responders during a crisis in the US stopping trying to help people to instead pray with an already safe woman
Like
good for her I guess that she got comforted but is that really uplifting
or a good idea
Well not necessarily bad, but I think it's safe to say that most of Europe agrees that we shouldn't be handing them out to everyone like they're charity leaflets
You're just being obtuse man it's pretty obvious what he meant
No, it's exclusively tabloid newspapers like The Sun that use fahrenheit to make the temperature seem higher than it actually is
Many Welsh place names are either slightly different in English (Cardiff - Caerdydd) or entirely different (Swansea - Abertawe)
There’s also the same for English places in Welsh, for example Bath - Caerfaddon or York - Efrog, and then extending that, New York - Efrog Newydd
There's loads in Welsh;
New York - Efrog Newydd
Cambridge - Caergrawnt
Oxford - Rhydychen
Rome - Rhufain
are just a few
Just focusing on the Welsh names, it's a fairly simple naming process
Places with Aber is where two bodies of water join
Usually a river with the sea (Ystwyth and Tawe) or two rivers (Cynon)
Places with Llan means church/parish of
Where I live, Llangrallo, the Saint of my local church is St Crallo
The C mutates to a G. Llantrisant means church of the three saints
(Llan-tri-sant)
Places with Caer is a good sign the Romans were there, and there's a castle/fort
Chester is just Caer, Carmarthen is Caerfyrddin, Caernarfon
Places with Bont has a big/significant bridge going over a river
May sometimes mutate to Pont
They occasionally do it with London (Llundain) on some signs but it seems fairly arbitrary whether they put Welsh names for English places on signs
Bryste is indeed the Welsh name for it (actually I live in Bristol now)
It’s just a welshified version of it, same as Lerpwl for Liverpool
I actually saw a bus service from Newport in Bristol the other day with “Bryste” as the destination on the front which made me do a double take aha
You hear the Welsh names for English cities on trains travelling towards England
People once spoke a language like Welsh in England so it's understandable
Amwythig (fortified place) for Shrewsbury is the most different sounding one I can think of
Also in political news in Welsh you'll hear San Steffan for Westminster
Parliament originally met in St Stephen's Chapel
Had a look at that last night - some of the satellite imagery is more up to date than Google Maps for a few towns I travel through often
I say I'm from Wales and if they don't know what that is I say UK

some old crone tried to buy my flock of sheep for some magic beans the other day
jokes on her magic beans go for £500/kilo
Never had it, but I'm not much of a seafood person in general
In terms of UK as a whole - I'd say anywhere that's not England, prolly mostly Wales as a whole (with the whole 'sheep shagger' thing)
In Wales - unsure really
Everywhere's a little bit of a meme I can't lie
EDIT: !!! The Midlands in England too
Mainly Birmingham afaik as well
Rhyl
Rhyl or Port Talbot are probably the closest we have
Arguably Swansea, Newport or Bridgend too
Absolutely not
I'm rather fond of not worrying whether my kids will get shot at school
Plus I like not being bankrupted by our healthcare system and the food safety standards are much higher at here
USA is a great place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there
I'm used to the comforts of home and not willing to give those up
If I was single it might be a different story but I don't think I'd like my children to grow up there
No, I just can't imagine fitting in with the US culture
Because of how similar it is to British (ie both English speaking, on top of other similarities) the differences would seem more distinct
Like I don't think I could ever adapt to summarising chips and fries into just fries and crisps into chips
Bit pedantic, but its the sort of thing that would cause everyday annoyance and confusion that would make life a hassle
No, everything is too big and car orientated, they put weird chemicals in the food and the guns would scare me
Also crazy stupid healthcare costs
I'm fairly certain you can buy disposable seat covers on the cheap if that's all you're missing in your life
Even that would make me uneasy
I prefer it here where I never have to think about guns as nobody has them
I do 4/5 too for childcare purposes
I have Wednesdays off and it's a fantastic split in the week
I'll be sad going back to 5/5
I saw 6 boxes of 50 covers for under  £4 on Amazon UK
That's 300 public poos
Not sure, but curry sauce and chips is popular in Wales
In Wales we have the Mabinogion
Centuries old folk tales that have inspired a lot of modern fantasy literature
Really good read
During the lockdown, mountain goats started roaming my town, Llandudno in North Wales
It was pretty cool, our town got on the national news

I'm not going to go mental at them for calling a lorry a semi truck or anything
In fact I quite enjoy saying "we do x here
" and seeing what they reply with
That said it does get annoying when people assume that all of the UK works in the same way, or all of Europe does (usually by assuming that something we do in the UK is Europe-wide, lol)
I mean, Carl Sagan is very well known in Britain as far as science communicators go
Well, "what's it like having a monarchy

Ditto the idea that most of Western Europe drives on the left :P
>I see this too often where people think that Germany (and all of europe) drives on the left side of the road
This was the one I was thinking of, yeah
Any safety critical role that sees you in charge of thousands of people a day will see the big £££'s roll in
Birmingham is more associated with the [Balti style curry]
In general older people are more nostalgic for it as they see it as a time when Britain was THE world power
I've seen polls where a sizeable number of them would like to bring it back
Contrastingly a much larger number of younger people see it as colonialism at its worst and are far more negative of that period of our history
Yes there is a very interesting generational dynamic for the last decade or possibly even longer
Younger people don't identify as British, rather as Welsh only, whereas older people are far more likely to identify as British only or Welsh and British
Just moved back home before lockdown started after 4 years in England/ Germany
Its good to be back but the pace of life is noticeably slower (mostly because Im from the countryside and spent my time in cities in England and Germany)
Perhaps you might want to try out the Welsh word [hiraeth] Seems to be similar to your meaning there
Yes, Portuguese right
I’ve heard that they are very similar meanings
I wear a white poppy to commemorate all who have died in all wars along with the demand that no more should die in any war
I don't. I appreciate what it represents and I remember the fallen of WW1 & 2 (including some of my own ancestors) quietly in my own way on Rememberance Day
Unfortunately the poppy has been hijacked by right wing British nationalists and thats something I just can't support
These are the same people who happily gloss over the the many crimes committed by the British army all over the world (including in Wales)
Not at all
Most European languages have a shortened name for it so English was an outlier
Czechia is so much less of a mouthful
I was calling it Czechia before I'd realised they officially changed it to Czechia
To me it just sounds natural
True, but you lot do also tend to call the UK Großbritannien or England so Geography clearly isn't the German school system's strong point ;)
He was spot on haha
The Welsh flag is pretty epic as is but I like the [battle flag of Owain Glyndwr] during his rebellion
we like dragons
I like [the flag/banner of Owain Glyndwr] which used to be historical but has seen a significant resurgence over the last few decades
Not necessarily
It has been used by nationalists, but no more than the actual Welsh flag or [the Flag of Saint David] I believe a similar variation is used in the coat of arms of the modern Prince of Wales, so it could be seen as quite British too
Glyndŵr's rebellion is interesting though and many things are still named after him here, including a few streets near me (eg Glyndŵr Lane) and even a [university]
IIRC you can basically 'split' Welsh into a dialect used in the North and a dialect used in the South
There are several words that are different, my Welsh is rusty now but I think the word for 'milk' is different in the two dialects
Amazing that people can be so
petty, I guess
Meanwhile, [here's Stephen Fry getting the Oxford vaccine]

English, Welsh, French, German, Polish, Spanish, Italian, Swedish & Portuguese off the top of my head
Welsh is "Diolch yn fawr" FWIW
English , Welsh , Irish , French , Spanish , German , Portuguese , Italian , Russian , Catalan  (just saw it here though so maybe cheating), Swedish (and other Scandinavian languages if they are all takk)
Read another couple here but I know I’m going to forget them so that seems to cover them all

It can fuck right off
Not sure if anything's happened here similar to that though
Personally, it's just another example of "offended culture".
I do know that in the UK at least, anything that The Sun newspaper does is generally seen in a negative light in Liverpool
I never really got the problem with this
People miss home comforts and sometimes you just want a burger or cornflakes or something
Honestly, spending a week in Singapore and trying 21 brand new dishes sounds a bit exhausting
I think I tend to average out at 2:1 new local food to western food
I find it's a good mix of trying new things with one thing a day I know I'll like
But, y'know, everyone's different and it's up to you
We were where the industrial revolution started in the late 1700s
Agreed - terroir is important

Germany
Small country by all metric measurements (ie if all overseas territories are considered then the UK and France catch up) but economically nobody competes
Quiet carriages are only really a feature on long-distance or Intercity trains
Cross Country withdrew them in 2014
South Western Railway is considering scrapping them, and LNER seem to have reintroduced them on the East Coast Main Line
I find First Class is generally pretty quite on ~~Virgin~~ Avanti services, that said we only do it a couple of times a year as a holiday 'treat'. Only had one bad journey
Cardiff has a lot to do and see so I guess it wins that one
Really the only other candidate is Swansea
Yeah, Conwy's a nice town (I think you've had this reply :P)
I like the medieval walls and the castle
The definitions of "city" get very weird very quickly in the UK depending on when the city became a city, if it has a Cathedral, if it was granted city status during a Queen's Jubilee, etc etc
Outside of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport Wales doesn't have any other 'big cities'. We've got towns that have a larger population than some of our 'cities'.
Only ever been for a day trip, but I can see why people like it, yeah
Oh, yeah, you can be out in the countryside or the coast very quickly
You've still got a decent rail and motorway link to London too
The Gower Peninsula and the Mumbles are both worth a visit in nice weather
Nice one
Re the train - I would guess it's because you change in London
We have a pretty strong Facebook meme community
But we haven't really made it to reddit yet
I don't use all, unfortunately I do still get UK news which is equally as depressing
I can still smell the Jorvik Viking Museum, York, UK
We have a [deep pit mine] very nearby which is now a National Museum (mining is a huge part of our history and basically the only reason people live here) so that was proper cool and something I always remember
Like an aquarium after an arson attack
We had sex ed lessons in biology in school but that was literally the science of sex (ie sperm + egg = baby) a few years later we had lessons on contraception and STIs but by then everyone was addicted to porn anyway
Mostly sex ed in school, but one Christmas when I was about 11-12 I had a book about it in my presents (and spent more effort keeping my little brother from seeing it than I did reading it)
We had fairly basic sex ed in Year 6, the teacher stopped the video when everyone got a bit too giggly and established that we were all just a bit embarrassed
Science lessons in year 7 or 8 went back over the use of condoms etc, and then we had more sex ed in Year 11
We're linked to Argentina through the Welsh speaking enclaves in Patagonia
Early 1800's people were leaving Wales as the industrial revolution took away their jobs and they set sail across the Atlantic to Puerto Madryn
Argentine government eventually clamped down on the colonisers but they still speak Welsh and still turn up for the Eisteddfod every year
The timing of the [Aberfan Disaster] always seems particularly cruel
The school was buried under the avalanche of coal waste barely 15 minutes after lessons had started that morning - and the school was due to close at 1200 the same day for a half-term holiday
Yes but the thousand year rivalry was a direct result of the complications caused by the conquest
Also England changed massively after the conquest so arguably it's still important in that respect
Going from a moving speech to "iconoclastic fury" to declaring independence from the most powerful empire in the world in a just 15 years sounds like a pretty quick escalation
Can confirm it’s either “I’m going for a piss” or “I’m going for a shit” for at least my area, but it’s quite rough around here
My dad when he came to the uk from Zimbabwe was confused why there were no public toilets in London
He spoke to my grandmother and she said go to a wc and he was confused what a wc was because they were just called public toilets in zim
I think they’re great
We have names like Aberaeron and Llanelli which don’t have English names but are nice and they we have places that do have English names (Caerdydd-> Cardiff) that I think are better in Welsh but are still good
That being said, Machynlleth and Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychchwyrndrobwyllsantysiliogogogoch are just unnecessary (still great though
I love Welsh place names as they describe the area :)
Common prefixes to place names in Wales are:
Aber - Estuary/Confluence
Caer - Fort/Castle (Chester is simply "Caer" as it was the Roman's main fortress in the area
Llan - Church/Parish/Monastery
Go look up place names in Welsh for all across the UK
Kaer literally means Fort in Welsh :) (Though spelt Caer nowadays), also "Gwynbleidd", Geralt's Elven name is just Blaidd Gwyn (White Wolf) but with the noun-adjective backwards
The ['Green desert'] , a large expanse of upland in mid Wales
It has limited infrastructure and is really only inhabited by small villages and isolated farming settlements, with a few larger towns on the outskirts along rivers
Yeah, I think these are the most common warning signs people will think of for the UK, along with the signs warning of [overhead live wires] or [live rails] on the railway network
[These ones]  with the stick man being electrocuted are good
Got the Welsh bilingual signs there too
...did you see the Styrian Grand Prix
Oh yes
Not so much Ferrari sadly
Hoping for a better race today
I put both eggs and milk in the fridge
For the eggs, I find they last longer if they’re in the fridge
I'm not sure about the two things you ask being connected, the first part of the question is easy enough to answer as plenty of places in the UK take excellent care of Roman architecture, for example the Roman Baths in Bath
I have never known anyone saying they took pride in being part of an ancient empire though, it's more viewed as a joke in sketches like Monty Python "what have the Romans ever done for us"
Britons didn't destroy everything
They were abandoned by Rome (for good reason) and were unable to defend themselves against the picts and the Irish, and later the Anglo-Saxons
Plus, most of the Romano-British cities were maintained by the empire and were unsustainable once the empire left
Dark ages of Europe is a myth
But for Britain it was very real
Writing disappeared from England for over a century
There was a massive population decline
The majority language of the populace completely changed
Christianity, which was commonly adopted by the Germanic migrants on the continent, was displaced in England by the pagan religion of the Anglo-Saxons
In most of the Empire it was only the administration that changed
For ordinary people life was much the same
However Britain was very much colonised by the Anglo-Saxons (whether this involved genocide of the more murderous kind is up for debate
Personally I think that most of the population remained the same, but the new rulers imposed laws that resulted in much of the populace converting (with very little mass murder being involved))
Although during the roman period, British civilisation was mostly limited to the cities (which is why when they declined so too did civilisation (the Anglo-Saxons weren't initially fond of cities as I understand it)), so it's not surprising that it was more fragile than Gaul and Southern Europe
Important to realise that for the vast, vast majority of people it’s an occasional weekend treat, maybe to try to shift a hangover - and usually becomes breakfast and lunch
The exception is mostly people with fairly physical jobs, who need calories
e.g. if you go to a “greasy spoon” cafe on a weekday, they’re usually full of builders and other tradesmen, with the odd group of students who haven’t been to bed yet
>if any damages were caused during this period by people under the influence, the state would be liable to pay out the compensation due to negligence so long as the damage were physical
So you're saying that if I filed a civil suit against a tortfeasor for damages to my property, and the Def
filed a Defence disputing liability because drugs were temporarily \*legal, a judge would side against me and/or order the claim be redirected

I definitely automatically try and speak with less of a Welsh accent when in England/talking to strangers in England
It’s mostly subconscious but also just for communication
I have had people who try and make jokes and stuff
Also, sometimes friends will argue about pronunciations/words for things but that’s usually in good faith
Overall the idea is that people with strong accents are working class or sometimes stupid, which is a little annoying, and it makes me want to speak in my accent more
I'm welsh, live in north wales and have most of my life but have an oxford accent due to living there for a few years as a child
I actually get mocked more than any scousers around here because I have such a weird accent comparatively
Okay, i am fully fine with putting ketchup on mashed potatoes because as a kid we would do this and mash the ketchup into the potato
with that said this was only when we had ketchup for some other thing that was by the potato, it was not intended to be ketchup on potato by my mother at least
Ketchup on PASTA however is a shocking abomination
We all know curry sauce is the superior sauce, come on now
Honestly I don’t like sausage rolls, vegan or otherwise, Greggs or otherwise
But I am experiencing withdrawal symptoms from Greggs vegan steak bakes
Idk if we’re all talking the same type of cheesecake, but my paternal grandparents hail from poland, and I grew up with a cheesecake  that I always knew as either “Jewish cheesecake” (just because they bought cheesecake for us from local Jewish bakeries where they lived in London) or “krakow cheesecake
” [Heres What I mean] which case I prefer it without raisins but I don’t mind them with raisins - adds a bit of variety if eating a larger chunk of cheesecake
It’s really nice
When I visit my grandparents, we always get cheesecake and while I hugely prefer the cheesecake without raisins, I also like it with raisins
They don’t have a raisiny taste, it just makes the texture more varied
I think it works for a dense but creamy type of cheesecake - I don’t see it working so well for a New York style cheesecake or whatever
Mind you I usually eat the cheesecake with raisins in slices from a loaf of cheesecake, and I think eating it from a round cake with slices wouldn’t be as nice either
Ah okay, [this is what I meant by cheesecake] but your style of cheesecake is the most common/popular in Wales, and yeah, not a good idea to have with raisins
Cymru - The English name "Wales" means "foreigners" whereas the Welsh name "Cymru" means "fellow countrymen". Just a bit nicer if you ask me
If switch Wales to Cambria, partially due to etymology but also because it's much easier to use as a demonym
Wales derives from old English "wealas" meaning foreigner or stranger
This is especially ironic because at the time the English were foreigners to Britain who were invading
Cambria derives from the Welsh word for Wales (Cymru) and has the same meaning (country or countrymen)
Also it's easier to call someone a Cambrian than a "welshman", "welshwoman", "welshperson", etc
I would either add the h back or change our name to "Dragons
Serious answer would be Cambria, the Latin name for Wales
Same etymology as our name for ourselves, Cymru, but I think it avoids the confusion of the u making an e sound for English speakers
It's a bit weird for English
Cambria (the Latin name for wales) derives from the same etymology but fits much better in English, so personally I think it is better suited
Drop the "r" for ease of pronunciation
Anatolia maybe
Turkland and turkia invokes the same imagery
Tfw English gets it right for once
>I think there are other regions in Europe with similar names in english and german, but I can’t remember them right now
Yeah, Cornwall in England has the same route, and I think theres a place in Switzerland too
(Bonus fun fact: Cumbria in England has the same route as Cymru)
>how do you read cymru
Is is like “Kumru”? It sounds badass but I’m not sure I say it right
"Kum-ree" is the best way I can describe it haha
Only problem with Cambria is that its so similar to Cumbria
I could see people confusing the two
1) Historically (at least during parts of the Roman period) Thrace was considered a part of Anatolia (probably due to Constantinople) though I understand the usage may have changed since then
I can't dispute the other two though
2) Fair enough, makes sense (and is something that I wouldn't have known about since I've always thought about Anatolia in the geographical sense)
I am, but I should probably go on a diet
Can I say the U.K.? When I was younger I thought we were so stable and that there was nothing wrong with having a figurehead monarchy and the way our government works
Now I feel alienated from my own government
I don’t think Westminster represents me (or Wales) in the slightest
There’s no respect for diversity (whether that be diversity in terms of communities from outside the U.K. or from things such as Welsh language communities within the U.K.), Wales has never voted for a Conservative government but we are forced to accept one
It just makes me feel like we are being government by a politically and culturally distant entity
As far as I can tell a number of English people feel the same way, so it’s by no means unique to my point of view as someone who is Welsh
It’s a frustrating position to be in, because I never conceived of living elsewhere but the political and social climate here is so toxic that I might have to leave if only for a few years
I only shared a washing machine in my first year of university
There were 2 between about 70-80 people
It was very annoying to carry a load of clothes down two flights of stairs and down a corridor just to turn back when both machines were full
Plus we had to pay for the machines anyway, £2 per wash
I would rather that to be absorbed into my rent and have one in my flat, than try and snipe opportunities to actually clean my clothes
The one positive is that when the pound coins updated the machine still took the old ones so I managed to get it for ‘free’ for a while, since my family gave me all their old coins
Even the people I know who did vote for what you’ve said describe a disconnect from their government
It genuinely feels like we are on the brink of *something* but I really don’t know what it is
There’s some sort of political brink being reached
Thank God it’s not my problem to solve
It does feel hard for me to ditch Wales and my family especially after the way this year has affected us, but I think I need to for myself, and it’s not like I can’t come back
Just hard to see what the world will be like post-COVID lol
Does the part where they suppressed the welsh language for favour of english and punished our children for it count
Yes
Just let us enjoy our own language and culture in peace
Well, tbh
We were one of the first to get forced to use it as our official language
I'm a bit annoyed, but, eh, not that annoyed
Gyda chi frawd
Cymru am byth
Just under a quarter of the Welsh population speak Welsh, mostly in the west and northwest of the country
As someone from the deepest, darkest southeast I am not among them unfortunately, but hopefully one day I will be
My county has (I believe) the lowest number of Welsh speakers in all of Wales
Edit: turns out we are only the second lowest (sarcastic cheer)
Currently learning Welsh so I can communicate better with some of my older relatives
Even though it's an official language in Wales, less than 30% speak it and it is like a minority language
Even by those who speak it, it isn't really used conversationally much
I have hopes that recent government efforts will revive it though
I've been learning Welsh
I can read a bit, but I'm way way off fluent
Mum's side of the family are from the south-west of Wales, and are all Welsh speakers
Dad's side are from the north-east of Wales, which is mainly an English-speaking area
Mum did think of teaching me to speak Welsh outside of school, but didn't. I did pick up German and to some degree French reasonably well in High School
Back in the 1990s all languages were optional past Year 9 (age 14), so I opted to carry on with German and French and drop Welsh
Welsh was undergoing something of a revival but I'd say that really 'took off' around the mid 1990s when the law gave it equal status with English
just as I stopped studying it
I do think I should go back and try something like Duolingo to pick it back up
I'd say Welsh is the healthiest of the minority native languages here in the UK, the 2011 UK Census put the number of Welsh speakers at ~562,000, or around 20% of the population
Now, that figure is a self-reported answer for people who have some level of Welsh language skills, however, as opposed to full fluency
There is still the east - west split with areas near the English border having a [lower percentage of Welsh speakers]
The language is still used widely on a day to day basis, even if you don't speak it
There's a Welsh-language TV station, [S4C] and a Welsh language [radio station] from the BBC
All [road signs] and [markings] are bilingual, with a recent law not only giving Welsh and English status as official languages of Wales, but also requiring all new and replacement signs to [put the Welsh text first] like this [example] Sticking with travel, at major railway stations in places like Cardiff, Swansea and Wrexham the Welsh language announcements will sound before the English ones
There are probably more examples, but those are the main ones the average visitor to Wales will encounter
Monmouthshire
>Edit: turns out we are only the second lowest (sarcastic cheer)
I got Torfaen to third lowest on Wikipedia, behind Blaenau Gwent and Newport
I'm in Flintshire, which was at ~20% which surprised me a little
I was expecting one of the lowest percentage areas to be us or Wrexham honestly
I have had contact with the welsh government education department, and they said they are looking for a way that will teach children welsh, so they will be willing to understand it and treat it like a btec
Torfaen, even Monmouthshite ranks better than us
Each one says something different, but the one I saw estimates that as of last Summer we're at 17
7% which is 2% higher than Bridgend and 0
1% lower than Monmouthshire
Honestly, I think it's the 'willing to learn' it part - I have relatives who recently finished high school and didn't see the point in learning Welsh
They couldn't put their finger on *why* exactly but it's probably a combination of things that put me off
* It wasn't taught very well (IMO)
* We weren't given a sense that it was our native language, or how there were repeated attempts to wipe it out
* The north-east of Wales is mainly-English-speaking, so you get a chicken and egg sort of situation around the language where nobody learns it because they can't really use it on a daily basis
Yes, I can never seem to find a consistent source for this stuff so just go with Wikipedia generally
It is a very weird case, there are rising numbers in every day speakers but the education system is failing to keep a constant link to the language and the people that embrace it
There was a review done where the more people start to flourish their welsh identity are more willing to back the learning of welsh in the country, and more recently so with the backing of welsh independence
We probably won't have any reliable figures until the census next year
Welsh medium schools are fairly successful and often are rated higher than English medium schools though
It also means that children to become fluent in the language
In English medium schools it’s just barely there
I’ve learned more Welsh on Duolingo and online than I ever did in school
I’m not sure if they can make the lessons better and more appealing to the point where people who speak English at home and live in a mostly English speaking town would switch to using Welsh
>There was a review done where the more people start to flourish their welsh identity are more willing to back the learning of welsh in the country, and more recently so with the backing of welsh independence
That wouldn't surprise me - but to get there we'd actually have to learn some recent Welsh history in school, too
I think its the implementation of it in schools, i used to live in wales in a english speaking town but rooted deeply in welsh history and plan on moving back very soon, i stayed their for all of primary school, and the welsh we got taught progressed to a point where when we had welsh lessons the entirety of the lesson was taught in welsh
The english medium schools, realistically need a more solid approach such as assemblies in welsh and more within the school day than just one lesson, but seeing the rise in welsh medium schools have made me very proud of the progression of our country since the language was banned
Very true
Yeah I think Welsh medium is probably good but obviously there needs to be a load of Welsh speaking teachers in all subjects
I lived in an English speaking town and once we got to year 9 all of our Welsh lessons were just how to pass the GCSE not how to speak Welsh sadly
We only had 2 hours a week so there was no time to learn anything other than that
I remember being angry about things like Aberfan and Tryweryn when I discovered the extent of them - but we never learned about either of them in school
When i learnt of it i was very young but understood the level of seriousness about it, but it didn't hit home in terms of my nationality and patriotic pride until i revisited it later on in my english exams  where we compared Aberfan and Tryweryn to a article written about an earthquake in london
To be honest it made me think about the way others schools within the UK talk about it as well
>When i learnt of it i was very young but understood the level of seriousness about it, but it didn't hit home in terms of my nationality and patriotic pride until i revisited it later on in my english exams where we compared Aberfan and Tryweryn to a article written about an earthquake in london
Similar for me, but we didn't cover it in exams
I think my feelings of injustice were reinforced by all the shit that came out recently around Hillsborough and Grenfell Tower, in both cases it's like Aberfan all over again and the victims need to be carful they don't get fobbed off
> To be honest it made me think about the way others schools within the UK talk about it as well
Sometimes I wonder if it's even covered outside of Wales :(
It is upsetting and, as a group of the most statistically welcoming people in the UK we need to ensure that we demonstrate support for others that have tragedies similar to ours
Its just the nice thing to do
Fully agree - I have seen newspaper columns warning of the Grenfell families being treated like the Aberfan families already
I thought Norwegian was the most linguistically similar to English
I mean most of western Europe is like that
You could say the same about the South East
This continent is basically tailored specifically for human habitation
Not a lot
I did used to work with a man from Sudan, and he makes tea weird
He once made me a cup of tea which was just a mug of milk, microwaved with a teabag floating in it, ew
Do all you guys make tea like that
The English
Either Hambones or townies
The former is closer to rednecks and the latter closer to chavs
I thought it was Andalusians
There are two 'branches' of Celtic languages:
**Brythonic** - Welsh, Cornish, Breton
**Goidelic** - Irish, Scottish, Manx
That's why you're seeing Scottish and Irish people say they can't understand Welsh in this thread
**Cornish:** I can kind of understand some of it
**Breton:** Never met anyone who can speak it, and I also probably couldn't even if I had because it's a lot closer to Cornish than Welsh
The Britons in Cornwall were separated from the Britons in Wales and Cumbria in the Battle of Deorham in 577, leading to the split in the languages (Welsh and the now extinct Cumbric grew from the western areas of Britain while Cornish and Breton grew from southwestern Britain)
And before anyone asks, I can't really understand Irish or Manx or anything else
Those are all in a different family of languages
I grew up on the isle of Anglesey in north Wales where Welsh is spoken pretty frequently, so I knew how to speak it from a young age
It is taught in schools here, but no one really ever took it seriously, especially in the south from what I've heard
It's a joke (at least in my area) to just say that the only thing that people in southern Wales know how to say in Welsh is "ga i fynd i'r tŷ bach os gwelwch yn dda
" ("can i go to the toilet please
Hung, drawn and quartered
Death by a thousand Sheep
Saying that, most of us would call that bliss
Seamus, get the fertilizer
Learning Welsh is mandatory up till year 11, we learn French or German from year 7 to 9 and then have the option to do GCSE French or German
We also have full Welsh schools where every subject is taught in Welsh and you have to be, or learn to be fluent in Welsh
Spanish is growing and recently overtook German in terms of uptake as many schools are abandoning German in favour of Spanish now
Mandarin is extremely rare, I don't know any schools that offer it
I left high school a long time ago so I can't say for sure, I've heard Spanish is offered in some schools though
Fun and bye are both hwyl in welsh
Increasingly I identify with Wales first, then the UK
Don't really identify with my village or county though
Yeah, probably the county if you wanted to narrow it down
I know in the South it would likely be "The Valleys" for a lot of people
We have a tongue twister 'The sixth sheik's sixth sheep's sick
I've *never* been able to distinguish between those and V/F ("vey fink"), even when somebody's trying to demonstrate the difference to me
To add to that, at "kick-out time" which is mostly 11pm or 2am, you suddenly get hoards of drunk people from different establishments out on the streets in close proximity all at the same time, all vying for food, taxis etc
This has been blamed as one of the reasons for the antisocial behaviour and is one of the things that has been talked about changing (possibly has been changed in some circumstances) to reduce the problems
But once it's part of the culture it's difficult to change it
Wales and New Zealand feel very similar culturally and geographically
Maybe even some of the Canadian maritime provinces as well
A few people have already said New Zealand for both the UK and Scotland, but I've always though NZ is very similar to Wales myself
* largely rural nations
* big farming industry
* more sheep than people, often the target of jokes there
* both export a lot of lamb
* both into Rugby
* both have a larger and more successful, well known neighbour (Australia and England)
I’ve not been but I’ve heard people say similar things about it being like Wales in certain ways (especially rugby)
A part of Warren Gatland’s (Ex-Wales Rugby Coach from NZ) autobiography talks about how when he was first getting the job he was taken in a helicopter ride over the South Wales valleys and the only thing he said is “it looks like back at home”. Partly because of the hills and valleys but also all the rugby posts sticking up in each village
Whoever organised that helicopter ride played a blinder in getting him to take the job aha
Lessons ended before Easter because its the exam period now but we were using Teams or blackboard collaborate
We're just watching sideshows of prerecorded lectures
Voice only, we also have added readings
Then we have a one hour chat on an online discussion board via blackboard
This is once a week
If we didn't have covid it would have been a 2 hour face to face meeting each week
I'm on an
Adult learners course which will hopefully allow me to get on to the course full time once I complete 6 classes
I'm currently on number 4 so fingers crossed
I would definitely say [The Aberfan Disaster] Many still say that it's murder, as the miners had been telling the mine owners that the slag piles were going to collapse for years
Most of the fatalities were schoolchildren (116 out of 144) as the slurry hit a school
[This short BBC video will fill you in]
Southall definitely - it would have been possible to turn the train in the Swansea area, IIRC
Instead it ran with a defective safety system that could have prevented the crash
Also: Clapham Junction in 1988:
Old wiring left in place led to signals displaying wrong aspects, 3 trains collided and 35 people were killed
Another mining disaster that was local to the area I live in:
It was the last day before Half Term too
about and hour later and all the kids wouldnt've been in school
There's no redeeming quality or bright side to Aberfan
It's all just horrible tragedy
Pretty much a lost generation
From what I can tell, it’s very common for people to develop some kind of spirituality around death
Rituals, and things like ‘feeling their presence’ once someone passes away, even if they’re not religious
In fact, so few people have any formal religious belief, and even fewer practice by going to places of worship, but nevertheless people do typically become more spiritual when confronted with death
I think that kind of mysticism is actually very common among anyone who doesn’t see themselves as a committed skeptic or atheist
I don’t personally have any religious belief, nor spirituality, but during hard times I’ve definitely felt like having that feeing of a connection to someone who’s died would make grieving much easier
it was cold, but it never snowed
[This photo]  of the [Aberfan disaster]  in 1966 by David Hurn
That, or the picture of [Susan Maybank being pulled from the wreckage, alive]
I think it was in every story about Aberfan I read when the 50th anniversary was commemorated a few years ago
This might sound weird but I love the way Dutch sounds
Maybe it's because we also have all the same "weird" sounds that Dutch has in Welsh so I'm used to hearing them
German is also very nice
I'm so sorry but to me it sounds like a Russian person trying to speak Spanish
Could have just been regular Danish, after all Danish is unintelligible even to Danes
Probably from Hedd Wyn's WW1 poem 'Arwr':
> A'i gwaed yn gymysg efo'r glaw
Meaning 'And his blood was mixed with the rain
These are very good suggestions
I reckon the first one is certainly the most iconic, especially in terms of being known by people elsewhere
There must be some brilliant Welsh language poetry too, since it’s such a bardic tradition, and it even has its own style, thought it sometimes is hard to distinguish when it’s a poem or a song lol
I can’t think of any specific one like examples sadly
The lines of the anthem and other popular songs like Calon Lân are pretty poetic in my eyes though
For example “Nid wy'n gofyn bywyd moethus,
Aur y byd na'i berlau mân:
Gofyn wyf am galon hapus,
Calon onest, calon lân.”
Which means “I don’t ask for a luxurious life, the world’s gold or it’s fine pearls, I ask for a happy heart, an honest heart, a pure heart”.
Which, while longer than one line, is a very nice sentiment
I'm in Wales, it doesn't exist as far as foreigners are concerned
They think British people either sound like the Queen or Dick Van Dyke's Cockney and have crooked teeth \*sigh\*.
The Anne Frank movie
Pretty much any film set in Germany that I can think of is
ahem, set in the 40s.
There's always the Augustus Gloop scenes in Willy Wonka
Hedwig and the Angry Inch is partially set in East Germany
Surprised noone has mentioned How Green Was My Valley
Brave and Braveheart
It's not foreign though
Dont talk down on the language, we genuinely do speak it and it has 2 more vowels than English come on guys
Tell us to start speaking English
The same applies to Wales
Saw a bullfight in about 2006 and even then it felt really barbaric how they just finished off the bull, cut its ears off and threw them into the crowd, before dragging the corpse away
That said the skill and nerve of the bullfighter was great
Eh they see a nice empty path, with no cars
Why not walk on it, bikes can always go around
(Not my opinion just what people might think)
Welsh is an official language of Wales (alongside English)
Which is more than can be said for England and English
OK, Germany Lite
Probably best not to, some will be offended some won’t, same in Wales
Just stick to Scottish or Welsh
Northern Ireland is a whole new can of worms
People often try to point out that Welsh ‘has no vowels in its words’ sometimes
Some words they’re referring to often have a Y in them, which is in fact a vowel in Welsh
EDIT: forgot
W is also a vowel in Welsh
Americans can do it too
Heard a few horror stories
Yes, indeed
Not any more - there was specific wording in the 1967 Welsh Language Act to change this:
>The fourth section of the Act repealed the provision in Part 3 of the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 that the term "England" should include Wales
Devolution has since given us control of things like healthcare and education, though I will point out that England and Wales still share a legal system
Touché
If you say popty ping
Genuinely never heard anyone use it, truly
But I’m sure Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantisiliogogogoch might get you a lot
It’s pronounced like ‘oo’, as in wool
No-one in the UK thinks IKEA is luxury and I say that as someone who mostly has IKEA furniture
It actually amazes me how Britain could actually be racist towards the Irish
That's like being racist towards your own people
It's insane
Most of it was motivated by religion but the fact that they changed it into a race thing is maddening
There's a large Polish community in Northeast Wales, centered around [Wrexham] There are several "Polski Sklep" type shops in Wrexham, and 10 miles away in the English city of Chester
Most of the large supermarkets have a [few shelves] dedicated to Polish foods, eg Tesco, Asda and Morrisons
I've only been brave enough to buy some of the chocolate bars
and a really helpful Polish guy unwittingly spoiled my fun by explaining what all the flavours were :P
One of my cousins is married to a Polish girl, they turned up to a party once with all sorts of meats - the various sausages in particular were very popular with everyone
In the town i live near there is an entire street just populated with polish residents, there is 4 shops two at each end,(quite a small area where this is), 2 of the shops are corner shops, the other 2 are hardware based
I go in every so often just to get a chocolate bar, but they seem quite friendly and nice to be around
Plenty of polski sklep's in the largest town to me over the English border
Every empty shop there soon seams to have a polski sklep/European foods place
There are Polish people here in Swansea, in fact the influx of Polish people is said to have stopped a Catholic church from closing
I'm a fan of the vegetable stock and the nice big juicy apples that Polish shops sell
Tried that polish beer, warka strong etc
God it gives you a helluva headache the next day though,  its rough as a badgers backside tbh
Veg stock might be a good tip, actually
The Knorr meat stocks have gone a bit poor recently IMO
Germany, so much happened in such a short period of time
Most of it bad but still very interesting
I know the words to only the Welsh anthem
I know the British (English) anthem but I don’t know the lyrics
This is the same for Ireland’s anthem(s), Scotland’s, Italy’s and France’s. I have heard the Spanish and German ones a few times but I doubt I could pick them out
I only hear them at sporting events and that’s usually watching the 6 Nations, hence how I know those 6 the most
Years of watching Schumacher and Ferrari dominate the sport have just left me confused now
I hear the German anthem and expect the Italian one to immediately follow it :P
I came here to say this
>Just realised essentially that’s every country in the rugby 6 nations
On that basis - tricky question time - what about *Ireland's Call*?
> Sorry lads but GSTQ is a bit of a bore
I'm increasingly of the opinion that England should adopt *Jerusalem* for sporting events
Using GSTQ in matches where they're playing Scotland, Wales or NI always seems a bit 'odd' to me as it's the UK's anthem
Some North Wales accents sound really odd to me
My mum was once in north Wales with work and a guy passed and said what sounded to here like “pishy dayguls
” He repeated it a bit and they eventually worked it out as “Busy day girls
”. I’ve never not understood but I do have to listen a bit more
North Welsh in Welsh is even harder for me since I’m not even fluent in the South Welsh dialect
I wouldn’t really count that though
This is hilarious to me (North Walean), I have come a cropper a few times in work when I've spoken Welsh to South Waleans and we both end up looking blankly at each other and then switching to English
I think the funniest difference is “nawr” and “rwan” for now
How can they literally be the same but backwards
What happened here lol
Don’t get people started on llaeth vs llefrith either
Llefrith/llaeth and cacen/teisen
I live in South Wales and the last time I saw snow that stuck to the ground in my city was 2011 but it snows every year on higher ground
Most young people here are atheists or at least not very religious
It’s rare you find an actually religious young person, and sometimes they are viewed as a bit weird
There are a few people who believe in god and such, but they aren’t like super devoted and follow every rule
Older people are more likely to be religious but most are fine with atheists
I think perhaps my Irish Catholic Nanna would be upset if she found out I was atheist, but more in a worried about me way rather than an angry way
Plus even though she cares a lot about religion (travelling to holy sites, church every Sunday), she came with us to a gay wedding so it’s clearly not that simple with her
I have no plan to tell her I’m atheist as all I have to do at the minute is sometimes go to church once a year when I’m Ireland, plus I do find church an interesting experience to listen to, even if I don’t believe it all
On the rise, [around 32% of people who responded to the 2011 UK Census] here in Wales stated they have 'no religion'.
They write themselves at the minute
Which one Boris(PM) or Mark(AM)
First off, we joke he sucks english pp, or where I'm from we do, second off, AM stands for assembly minister, basically Wales' PM
I never knew this
should we be pronouncing it like sean connery
Welsh - when I meet someone new and tell them I'm Welsh, their first question is always if I speak Welsh, I'm always embarrassed that I have to say no
I've been trying during lockdown to learn it, and I'm making progress
I'm able to say a lot more in Welsh now than previously but I'm not at the point where I could hold a conversation in Welsh yet
Hungarian - I visited Budapest just before Christmas last year and absolutely loved it
I'd love to go back and see the less touristy and less cosmopolitan parts of the country, and being able to speak the language would be a great help with that
Dutch - of all the countries I've visited the Netherlands is the one I've spent the most time in apart from the ones where I speak the language (ie apart from the UK and Germany)
I know the Dutch speak ridiculously good English but still, I think its a cool language, and its a good half way point between my 1st and 2nd languages (English and German)
Diolch yn fawr
I never understand why people want to learn Welsh, I hardly know anyone who speaks it
Learning Spanish currently, it's hard but I am enjoying it
I have never seen anything so funny as Germans in Majorca , who hardly speak any English, trying to order drinks in English to Spanish bar staff who hardly speak any English, it's something to behold
I am old and I go to areas full of other old people,  so am really talking about middle aged Germans, not the young
It must be hard though, I have given up with my wife (who speaks no Spanish) going to the bar, it's just too much trouble .
Most pubs here are only licensed till 11 or midnight outside of cities
The only way to stay later is if you know the landlord and they do a “lock-in” which essentially means you are just drinking in their house, so as long as they don’t take payments (outside of licensing hours) then it’s fine
Pubs in cities stay open later, but they’re usually a bit less chilled than a classic pub
This totally depends on age and event for me
As a student, and someone who has a couple of friends who don’t drink, at the pub you might arrive with 3 friends, meet 2 more later, one leaves halfway through, and throughout people you sorta know are coming and going and everyone is drinking at different paces
If you start paying rounds, someone at some point is going to get screwed over
It’s not uncommon to pair up or even do a 3 but I don’t think I’ve ever been in a whole group round at uni
If I’m at the pub at home, with family or friends, it’s usually a lot clearer who is staying for how long and rounds are done
Pubs and nightclubs can refuse anyone service and they don’t really have to give the individual any reason why
Of course it’s polite to
I’ve worked at a pub and club
In the club it was usually if someone is too drunk, so you write it down in a refusal book, so that if they are found ill or worse later on it doesn’t end up as your fault
You aren’t allowed to refuse service based on anything other than behaviour or action, but you also don’t have to give your reason so it’s still technically possible
[Here’s ] an article about it
Nightclubs do this and some more bar-y places but I don’t know of any classic pubs that do this, classic pubs the landlord lives upstairs so if they were open till 3/4 and then opening at 11 that would be some painful hours, though it’s not unheard of that some lock-ins with locals lead to this
I would write their name and the reason, the customer would likely be unaware that this exists, it’s just for legal reasons so that we don’t get in trouble for serving an obviously drunk person
If you refuse for other reasons it’s just evidence to your boss that you are refusing for genuine reasons, like violence or refusing to pay etc
The only place I’ve seen armed police outside of London and airports was at [The Royal Welsh Show] As it is royal-endorsed, there’s typically a member of the royal family present, and as such there are a few armed police patrolling
It’s a little surreal though, walking through huge pig, sheep and cow barns, only to see 4 armed police offers
Or watching a horse jumping competition etc
I've once seen armed police in my city
I walked into the train station and there was a policeman with a big gun
I was only going to use the cashpoint there so walked straight out and to a different cashpoint
It was because Obama was visiting the next city, not even anywhere near us
Local police once took down an armed hostage taker with a taser, dressing up as chefs delivering food
We were taught Australia, New Zealand and the surrounding islands as being the continent ‘Australasia’ rather than ‘Eurasia’
Out of curiosity, why would Eurasia be one continent, but Afro-Eurasia not
Varies
Went cycling from Newport to Pontypool and apart from some crossings and residential, all canal towpath and cycle lanes
But going around cities are usually shite
NationalCycleNetwork has the proper map
Cardiff: Nonexistent
There's a few useless strips of paint here and there
Also a few equally useless "shared cycleways" which are just pavements you're allowed to cycle on
Not good
Too hilly here so not many people cycle casually
Non casual cyclists have to go on the road
Usually takes place at my grandparents house (mum's side) or in a pub (dad's side)
Mum's side: everyone will have a buffet style dinner, the women stay at the table and chat, them men go downstairs and drink some beers while watching something on the TV (usually football or cricket)
The children occupy the space in between (my grandparents have a relatively large house so plenty of room for all)
Dad's side: begins relatively civil with chatter over a few drinks
Rapidly decends into chaos as we get more drunk
"Lle i bopeth a phopeth yn ei le"
simply means
"A place for everything and everything in its place", the sort of phrase you'd see on a twee plaque made by an anally-retentive shed owner
But it perfectly shows the weirdness of Welsh mutation where words which start with certain consonants change depending on grammar rules and other words preceding them
The word for 'everything' can be popeth, bopeth, phopeth or mhopeth in different situations
It can make looking words up in the dictionary tricky but it's cool how your brain adapts to choosing the right one naturally
English:
One-one was a racehorse, one-two was one too
One-one won one race, one-two won one too
Owain Glyndwr
Nye Bevan
Maybe Boudicca if you want to count her
We don't really cover much Welsh history at all, particularly ignoring the medieval period when Wales had more of it's own history (as opposed to being part of English history)
Happens to quite a few British tourists here in Southeast Asia, particularly places like Pattaya
Mix hopeless fuckers with balcony and the result lands on the pavement, I guess
That's an interesting observation actually, because traditionally Welsh speakers have compared English's poetic ability to that of a cawing of a crow lmao
Not a quote but I'll add it anyway because it always makes me laugh
Wales had just battered England 30-3 in the rugby (one of our biggest ever wins over them), at full time they go back to the pitch side pundits, who are known for being biased towards England
[Have a guess which one of the pundits is Welsh]
That may be so but they always find an excuse to talk about England
I don't really see why its necessary to have an English pundit at Wales vs Italy or Scotland vs France but there always seems to be one
BBC's format for the 6 Nations tends to be Inverdale/ Gabby Logan, 1 English pundit and 1 pundit from each country playing (unless England are playing then its 2 English pundits)
Surely they could just not have the extra English pundit and keep it to Inverdale/ Logan + 1 pundit for each country playing
When I was growing up in the 80s and 90s it was seen as a third world, poverty stricken, shitpool of Europe
Somewhere to send aid parcels to when there were no problems in Africa
&#x200B;
Nowadays it's average GDP per capita means they should be sending aid parcels and support to where I grew up
There's still a lot of lingering views of Romania from my generation of the same poverty stricken hole as they once were, although I suspect younger Redditors would have a more favourable view of the country
&#x200B;
On the other side, I knew two brothers from Romania when playing an MMO and they shared a brain cell between them
There are several medieval castles in North-east Wales, however due to their proximity with the English border, many were destroyed in battles against English forces in the late 13th century, particularly [Ewloe] [Caergwrle] and [Hawarden]
[Flint Castle] is reasonably well preserved, but you have to look further west to [Rhuddlan] or south to [Chirk] to find the region's best surviving castles
The [Newport Transporter Bridge] there are fewer than 10 in the world and only 2 in the UK (the other being in Middlesbrough)
It still works too
Hopefully our infrastructure would improve massively - but at the cost of much of North Wales becoming urbanised
Meanwhile, us 750,000 who moved down South are now drowning in motorways and electric trains
Yes
I'd forgotten that - the Welsh spoken in North Wales is a different dialect to that spoken in South Wales
> Midlands erasure is real
Erasure are from London though
On a few nights out in Bristol they put a plastic urinal thing like from a festival out on the street so people piss in that rather than on the street
It’s quite publicly located but no one seems to care, it’s well used
People regularly go down quiet alleys if they’re drunk or there’s no toilets nearby
It’s frowned upon but most people would get away with it
I'm not sure shocked is the right word, but people always seem surprised when all our worded road signs are in English and Welsh
Personally my family doesn't do that but it doesn't sound too outlandish, surprised that people find it weird
I thought most recent UK windows are double glazed
I rarely come across a single pane window, though perhaps that might be because I'm quite well off
I don't think we even have them *here*, it's just an American thing as far as I know
We don’t really have them in the UK either, they’re a US thing not an English thing
We don’t test for spelling beyond like age 8 - you’re just sort of expected to be able to spell things
But idk it’s been a while since I was in school so I don’t remember completely
Yeah Same for us too
Whilst I’d call English the Primary language in Wales, Welsh is a mostly phonetic language
(However there are sometimes some pesky double letters like “diwydiannau”. “n” and “nn” are the same)
I disagree, French spelling follows its own rules and has a logical flow unlike English
I've avoided flying the last few times I've visited Ireland from Wales
The train connections to Anglesey and Fishguard are shockingly bad, it's like going back in time
In summer 2019 I travelled from Belfast to Swansea in one interminable day by train and ferry
The Enterprise running from Belfast to Dublin was the only part that went smoothly
I've noticed that that ticket is no longer available to buy and am not sure if it's because connections are too unreliable or because of Brexit
I'm 158 miles from Dublin and really wish the non flying option was a lot quicker
Only 2 hours on the train to Paris
Takes me longer to get back home to Wales
(London)
I think you can still get the idea though right
Like Europe is old and small but America is young and big
So travelling 100 miles in Europe means another language/country/culture, but a 100 year old building isn’t really remarkable
I hope it's temporary as it's good to have one ticket for the whole journey in case of delays
The SailRail tickets are a long standing affordable option and I'd hate to lose them
Paris or Amsterdam would still be a 75ish min flight from Newcastle or Glasgow
Maybe because of the language thing
I'm Welsh and don't feel that way at all, we're used to dual languages
Edit: I'm not trying to be confrontational here, I just want everyone to love travel as much as me ;-)
Well, I actually am Welsh and whilst I'm first language English, everyone can understand and speak more than anyone from over the border would think
Most of our place names are in Welsh, for example, and everyone learns it up till 16
I'm not sure why you felt the need to try to tell me about how I, and all of my compatriots, understand our own language
Probably more common with older people, bakestones
Thick bit of metal you put over a stove top to make welshcakes
They are
Stodgy, sweet goodness
Proper ones have raisins and sultanas in, but you can get chocolate chip, jam, all sorts
If you ever come to Wales, find the welshcake stand in the town/city's local market and get some warm
Yeah - also British Italian checking in
What I've seen is what you suggest and also a decline in cooking ability in Italy
E.g. My Nonna was an excellent cook, but my Italian cousins don't show much interest
I did a free online city design module from the US where I had to identify the grid and the axis in my city
There really isn't a grid or an axis here
I get frustrated walking in US and Canadian cities that I've visited because I always looking for a diagonal shortcut that doesn't exist
It took me a while to understand what zoning meant and was puzzled why people couldn't just live near work and shops
And I was an adult when I first played Sim City
I agree
My Dad is a lifelong Labour voter and although he did eventually vote Labour in 2019 he said he was very close to not bothering voting at all for the first time in his life
Personally at the UK level I feel very disenfranchised
I live in a safe tory seat, and I am seriously wondering if theres any point voting anymore in Westminster elections at all, as things stand right now I probably won't.
Welsh Parliament elections are different as they use a more proportional system, so I actually feel like my vote does count for something
There’s many primary and secondary schools that are 100% in Welsh (beside English lessons)
All of us from the start of school to the end of GCSEs study Welsh as a lesson, but in English medium schools this is usually fairly poorly taught
Every child is within the catchment of one Welsh-medium primary and secondary school by law, I believe
So anyone is afforded the opportunity to have their kids grow up fluent in Welsh, and often these schools are the better ones in the area
I think the intention is to slowly move more schools to be Welsh medium, but it’s obviously limited by the number of Welsh speaking teachers
It’s certainly a success in terms of resurgence but it’s still on a knife’s edge as there are a lot of people with huge biases against it and who have no idea of the history as to why we don’t all speak it
If at school they’d taught us about the Welsh not, the violence, the blue books, the forced destruction of our language, we would be a lot more passionate about learning it when we had the chance, sadly they just have to teach us what we need to get through an exam
So it’s a lesson everyone ends up hating and sometimes their parents biases are laid into them as well such as “pointless language”, “dead language” or “I’m English so there’s no point”, “not a useful language” etc
Depends where you are but my school was roughly a quarter to a third English, some people had two English parents and considered themselves Welsh because they grew up there, some considered themselves English
Then there were kids who’d moved to Wales when they’re like 12 and they were typically the ones more likely to say that
I believe one quote was “Wales is a shit country anyway and I’m not coming back once I grow up so there’s no point”. Lots of fun
I used to live in a large city in England and my partner in a very rural area, she would drive around country lanes very fast, literally 20 mph faster than I could, I could never understand it, but, when she visited the city and was driving, it was like being driven by a learner driver, so my guess is it's just experience, which I suppose is obvious in hindsight
Bread of Heaven or Delilah
What else could make us Welsh rugby fans feel more patriotic than singing about how Tom Jones killed his lady
Wales comes from Germanic origins and means (approximately) "foreigners". So by calling ourselves Welsh we are also calling ourselves foreigners
In contrast the Welsh word for Wales (Cymru) comes from ancient Brythonic and means (approximately) fellow countrymen
In terms of actual place names, [Newtown] in mid-Wales is a little 'odd'.
First settled in the 13th century, it was only designated as a [new town] in the 1960s, when more well-known new towns like Milton Keynes, Stevenage and Hemel Hempstead in England were all being built
Wow I didn't know that
I knew there were other places that shared the etymology of Wales (eg Wallonia and somewhere in Switzerland I think) but I would have never thought Italy would be one of them
On a related note, I can think of three Newports off the top of my head
One is about 900 years old, one is about 700, and the third is 90 miles inland
David Walliams and Matt Lucas want to know your location
Or do Whales just like Wales a lot
Its debated both ways, nobody knows for sure but both meanings are similar
Foreigner is the more common knowledge translation here
Love that idea, lets do it haha
I'm not sure, but IIRC the last time this came up there were 2 Newport in Wales alone
I'm not sure but it's pretty ironic given that UK government was actively trying to eradicate Welsh language until not too long ago
Welsh won't die out
It currently has official status from the UK government and if any attempt was made to remove that there would be outrage and calls for independence
That alone should be enough to keep it around in the future
Unified foreign policy and monetary policy is also important
You can't be a union if every decision you make is vetoed by Malta
Inviting the Anglo-Saxons over after the fall of Rome
Inviting some Germans over as mercenaries to fight the Picts
Great job, Vortigern, you dick
This is definitely our worst mistake
Didn’t even realise that this didn’t happen in more places (despite actually knowing how and why my brain just didn’t click until like 4 years ago)
I’m at 51
5 degrees
It only bothers me when I’m working a long day and leave the house in the dark and return in the dark, but as a student at the minute I have time when the sun is up to do things
The sun rises around 8:15 and sets around 16:00, this is considerably longer than 10 degrees further north
It’s never really bothered me, it might do further north where there’s only 2-3 hours of sunlight, but I feel like the summer makes up for that with late nights that are light
My American family find it crazy in summer when they come over and it’s light till around 22:00
I even remember visiting Munich (~48 degrees) this summer and listening to Americans enjoying the late light
It bothered me a bit this year, as I went to Malaga in Spain to visit a friend a week or so ago and it was light till 18:00/19:00, it’s just nice to be able to relax in the early evening and be outside
I’ve adjusted back now though
This didn’t happen to me, and it’s actually the opposite situation, but it’s still cool
Whenever I (and a fair few people from Wales), travel abroad, even though I don’t speak Welsh fluently, if I’m with someone else from Wales, I’ll occasionally speak Welsh, either if it’s to keep something a secret or to stop people trying to get you to buy something/come to their restaurant
They ask if you speak English and you say “Na, dw i’n sîarad Gymraeg” and they give up
So this Welsh couple were on holiday in Greece (not sure where exactly), and a restaurant owner tries to get them to come in, they do this exact thing only for him to reply in Welsh
Turns out he’d lived there for years and his wife was Welsh and a Welsh speaker
So they did go to his restaurant and ended up having a great time
We're within 20 minutes of [Erddig Hall] in North Wales
The one time we tried visiting, it was closed for the day
Go on one of the solstices, it's free
Other stone circles exist, I was really impressed with the Callanais Stones on the Isle of Lewis
>Or we say "een o-li-fant, twee o-li-fant, drie o-li-fant" ( one elephant, two elephant)
That's what I learned as a kid in Wales (in English)
I have a weird habit where I don't drink tap water in foreign countries (and by foreign countries I mean every country that's not Wales)
I should probably try and get over it tbh, it'd be cheaper
Most European countries aren't innocent, but one of the few that is is Wales
Though that might be because since the Roman period we had our lands colonised and then after that were desperately trying to survive before being annexed by England 600 years ago, so we never really had a chance to do awful shit
Technically we were part of the British empire but that was mostly England and Scotland
Tbf wasn't Scotland (or the Scoti) actually an Irish clan who invaded and settled in the area of modern day Scotland
Everyone on this island can point at everyone else for something or other, no one is innocent (except the Manx probably, they seem pretty chill)
Due there is a reason all evil empires in films have an rp accent, Britain is the go to for evil empires
Wilkinson Sword in the UK used to make scissors but were bought out by Fiskars and think made them on license
My Grandad was production manager for Wilkinson Sword in Bridgend and pretty sure my nan still has some scissors that look like that, but with Wilkinson Sword logo on them
They still make razor blades/shaving stuff and think gardening tools
I dunno, I guess we'd have to put our women on alert just incase the French try to invade Wales again
Other than that nowt would change
Absolutely fuck all my dude, well as far as i am aware
Ah yes
That'll scare old boneys descendents no doubt
The Irish are getting in on this too
Wouldn't be the same without you boyos tbf
Britain looks at France
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man
For Wales, definitely a castle, probably Caernarfon
The bridges over the canals can be a bit steep
Wales was a series of independent states from when Magnus Maximus withdrew Roman troops from Wales between 383 and 410
So could be called independent/free
These were unified into one Welsh state by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in 1057
This state lasted until the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd (or Llywelyn the last) in  1284, in war with the English, which resulted in the full annexation of Wales, with the Statute of Rhuddlan
There’s a story that the English king said Wales would always have a prince who speaks not a word of English, and then gave that title to his infant son
(So around 890-930 years)
Owain Glyndwr led a rebellion in 1400
During which Wales’ sovereignty was recognised by both Scotland and France (I believe), and was somewhat independent of England for a few years
The last stronghold falling in 1409, but Glyndwr was never found so he now has sort of a myth that he’ll return if/when Wales is threatened
(So a maximum of 9 years really, more like 1/2 in reality)
Wales was still somewhat legally different to England until 1535 and 1542 when the Laws in Wales acts forced English laws and customs on all of Wales, though also provided Wales with parliamentary representation
It also prevented Welsh being used in court and public office, anglicising the gentry of Wales
Since then we have been a subject of England essentially, though over the years steps have been made to make us an equal, whether or not that’s true is debatable, but we received devolution in 1998, so if you consider that free, then 1998-now
Edit:Typos
If you're talking about Wales then probably 410 (fall of rome) - 1283 (final conquest by the english)
If you're talking about any state on the island of Britain then 927 - today
Unless you count rule by non-british kings in which case it's closer to 1485 - today (with brief periods of british rule before the Norman conquest)
Personally I don't consider a people group native to a land unless they've been there for about 500 years
So by that metric the English are considered foreigners until the 10th century
Now though, they are just as native as the rest of us
Does the Kievan rus count
It sounds like it was centred on Kiev, so wouldn't that mean it was also centred on Ukraine
Relevant username
Not really
We were ruled by Danes for a lot of that time
1485 - today is better
From 1485 - 1689 we were ruled by native Britons
From 1689 - today we were ruled by a combination of Dutch and Germans, but due to the glorious revolution their power was extremely limited (even more so after George III) and Britain was de facto rules by native Britons, at first in an oligarchy and then in a democracy
It got to number one in the itunes singles download chart and something like 30 in the actually official weekly one I believe
I think its the highest charting Welsh language song but there might be one by Super Furry Animals which got higher
Still cool though
Liege
It was okay but I thought it would be a bit better than it was
Didn't help that on the day I went there was big construction works causing disruption on the trains from Germany so it took me about twice as long to get there than it should have
They used to be, but then they all got bombed in the war and rebuilt in the 60s/ 70s
Yeah they were rebuilt with ugly 60s/ 70s architecture
Coventry for example used to be an ancient medieval city but it was almost completely destroyed in one night in November 1940
Now its full of ugly concrete buildings from the 60s.
It would be nice if they did but it would cost way too much and cause too much disruption
When I worked at a quiet pub in a small village the bartender told me to ID anyone who asked that question because chances are they were young and looking for a cheap way to get drunk
It’s weird for the bartender to have been rude like that though, it’s entirely up to the customer what they ask for, and sure it might make you make a mental judgement but it’s none of your business really
I don’t like doing it because it feels weird to out myself as drinking to get drunk, but I did it a lot when I’d just turned 18
I usually now just get what I want to have and pay the extra 30-50p per pint/drink I’m especially going to do this post-coronavirus
This isn’t a universal UK thing
What’s happened is you’ve been to an upper class establishment where you’re expected to spend or at least pretend you can
The difference between the UK and Canada is that the class divide is more pronounced here
I think the London aspect is the missing piece here, not anything about British culture in general
If you’re stepping into an upmarket, low-light bar in Sloane Square then there’s going to be an uncomfortable snobbery
I don’t think it’s justified, but you can guess it would happen
If you did the same thing in Darlington with a sense of humour, I think it’s 50/50 on whether they’d humour you or think you’re taking the piss
I don’t know, depends if the person at the bar takes any sort of commission, which I don’t think is common
Still, I think your analysis does add something, and the Mitchell and Webb sketch is a funny one that I happened to watch the other day
In the Welsh alphabet it’s pronounced “aets”, slightly similar to if I said “eights” in English
It’s pronounced the same as in English on its own, like the h in hat
If it’s in a ch then it becomes like Scottish loch or Yiddish chutzpah
If it’s in an nh then it becomes nasal
If it’s after a t it is like an English voiced th
(the unvoiced equivalent is written as dd)
If it’s rh then it’s voiceless and trilled, so like the r in pretty but trilled
If it’s in an ngh then that’s an ung sort of sound at the back of your throat, but also nasal
It’s a voiceless velar nasal according to the internet
It can also be present in a ph which makes an f sound like English (an Ff sound in Welsh since a single f is equivalent to an English v)
Edit: A is pronounced as “ah”
Belarus and Turkey with their current governments
I dunno about countries per say but there are definitely some European cities I'd avoid, Paris for one, not so much due to the city itself although it apparently does stink of pee
It would be due to parisians and their famous attitude problem
Similarly Barcelona, as it reportedly has a problem with pick pockets
But countries
I don't think there would be a country I wouldn't visit
Isn't that a decision made at a local goverment level though
It may not be representative of Poland at a state level
Still it's a incredibly shitty thing to do though in my opinion
Is it
I've seen some good answers on here
Especially concerning Turkey, Poland and Russia
Personally I'd say Cardiff is better than both London and Paris
But then again I may just be biased
Deus vult
Well Russia and Poland aren't very welcoming to LGBTA+ people and Turkey is currently on the verge of starting off a regional conflict against Russia
So yeah
Despite your points I'd still rather avoid them, just saying
Jesus isn't a prophet in Christianity but he is in Islam
In the most basic sense he is a prophet, but because Christians see him as God in the flesh his status as a prophet is not his not the primary focus
So while he's 'technically' a prophet, you won't find him in lists of Christian prophets
Christians wouldn't say "the prophet Jesus" whereas Muslims would, though both see him as the Messiah
Some Christians consider Malachi (before Jesus) to be the last prophet (implying Jesus was not to be considered a prophet in the strictest sense), some see John the Baptist (contemporary to Jesus) to be the last, some consider the author of the Book of Revelation (after Jesus) to be the last
Generally the end of prophethood is kind of implicit/assumed in Christianity though
In Islam it's much more straight forward – Muhammad was the last prophet and that's that
In order to be a prophet you need to be a messenger for God and make prophecies (which come true)
Obviously this has lead to a whole bunch of (largely peripheral) sectarian arguments over who is a prophet and who isn't.
I literally found out about it from this post, so it's safe to say no
Wales is much the same as the rest of the UK
No equivalent to the Gendarmerie
There are 4 regional police forces - North Wales Police, Dyfed Powys Police, South Wales Police and Gwent Police
There are large rural areas in both the [North Wales] and [Dyfed Powys] police force areas, and they have dedicated rural crime teams
Otherwise we've got the same 'specialist' police forces as the rest of the UK - the British Transport Police (railways), Military Police and Civil Nuclear Constabulary have all been mentioned already
I'm in Llangrallo (Coychurch), a village in pen--y-bont ar Ogwr (Bridgend)
Llan which is a common in place names means church
However it's more like church or parish of, as the proper translation for church is Eglwys
The church was built after St Crallo, but with the mutation the C turns to a G. So Llangrallo means church of St Crallo
Pen-y-bont means the end of the bridge and Ogwr is the river Ogmore running through the middle of town
The original bridge is still there along with a few new ones
I live near to Cwmbrân, Torfaen
Cwmbrân translates into English as "Valley of the crows". While my county, Torfaen, means "breaker of stones" and is a reference to the river that runs through the Valley
There isn't much history for these names as they are both new creations
Cwmbran is a new town, so the entire town was built after WW2, while Torfaen has only existed since the 1990s.
Historically the entire area was part of Gwent, which gets its name from the Roman built town for the Silures tribe, who were the celtic tribe that lived in this area, which was called Venta Silurum ("Market of the Silures" in English)
Venta is now the town of Caerwent meaning "Fortress of Gwent".
Cardiff, Swansea, Aberystwyth and Bangor are the main ones
I just had a look at the Grauniad university guide for the first time in a decade and the Welsh unis place:
31st - Swansea
38th - Cardiff
54th - Aberystwyth
57th - Trinity St David
78th - Bangor
98th - South Wales
112th - Glyndwr
113rd - Cardiff Met
Out of 121 total
Bit depressing, that

You do realise Tolkien was a devout catholic and biblical themes play a large part in LOTR right
(Valleys) Welsh here
I had to learn to speak clearly, with English instead of Welsh grammar, syntax and words when I first got a job from Uni across the border
I'm a first language English speaker, or so I thought before moving
I know I have to speak properly to anyone who's not Welsh, but if I speak to anyone from home or have a few pints in me, I'm straight back to it though
The UK had an opt-out
I suspect we won’t get it back in the event of a “Brejoin”
Welsh cakes with butter, or just a dusting of sugar
The north/south might as well be divided like Korea
Sweden
Something about how the roads look, how the fluorescents hit the snow in dark winters, how the language sounds
I watched a lot of Swedish movies as a kid, and having spent so much time in Denmark I wanted to know what the neighbour was like
I was dead set on going to Stockholm
I knew nothing about the city, its size, how it looked; I just knew I wanted to go there
My favourite city I have ever been to
I’m hoping to move to Sweden next year
Would like a general EU issued passport with variations on the design based on region (iirc they already do this with the euro)
Just hope we end this madness before we leave and end up spending the next 2 decades trying to get back in
Ideally one saying "Gweriniaeth Cymru - Republic of Wales" but an EU one would be better than UK
Make sure that they leave plenty of room for national or "state" symbols
For example, a gold Welsh Dragon surrounded by EU stars on the front
Republic of the Britons
After 2000 years maybe it can become a reality
L'Internationale would probably piss off some eastern Europeans
Also it's French
In Welsh it is:
Pen, ysgwyddau, coesau, traed,
Coesau, traed,
Pen, ysgwyddau, coesau, traed,
Coesau, traed,
A llygaid, a clustiau, a trwyn a cheg,
Pen, ysgwyddau, coesau, traed,
Coesau, traed
Which is mostly similar to the English
It’s, heads shoulders legs feet, so no knees and no and
Then it’s and eyes and ears and nose and mouth
So a slight change in the order
The number of syllables matches  more closely this way, I assume that’s why the and is dropped
>make a more democratic system work
Honestly I don't blame you for this, it's a common portrayal
But one entirely incorrect
During the Interregnum there were 3 main periods of government
The first was the rump parliament, which consisted of MPs still remaining in Parliament after a number had been forcibly removed by the army
After a few years they tried to have new elections to replace the missing members and Cromwell shut them down
He replaced them with the Nominated Assmebly (/Barbon Parliament/Parliament of Saints) which was a parliament of men handpicked by him under the criteria of being "godly". After a couple of months they began to clash with Cromwell, so shockingly he forcibly dissolved them
Having had his first two systems fail, Ctomwell resorted to pure military dictatorship, ruling with all the powers of a king, but not the title
There were parliaments during this time to fulfil the traditional role of 'advising the monarch', but Cromwell frequently ignored them and even dissolved them again at one point
While Cromwell wasn't 100% evil, his stance on democracy is not where he is partially redeemed
I wish this comment was an automatic response whenever this is brought up
Anyone who knows anything about Cromwell knows he was tyranic, he's still a great figure
Imagine if every time Genghis Khan were brought up, people felt the need to point out he was a nasty bloke
About €160, but I get a lot of takeaway food so I could decrease that by quite a lot if I had any willpower

This is inspired by Donald Trump referring to Prince Charles as the "Prince of Whales" in a tweet recently
>This is inspired by Donald Trump referring to Prince Charles as the "Prince of Whales" in a tweet recently
I'm just going to assume this was an Autocorrect fail or something
I've seen plenty of people make that same mistake on Reddit
Eh, I've seen the same mistake often enough
I suspect most phones aren't intelligent enough to understand context in sentences and shit, so I can see why they would try and correct the phrase "Prince of Wales".
Haha, no worries
Like I said you see it a lot on here so I'm not bothered by it now
Yeah that makes sense
Good point
That's probably the most likely explanation, sadly
Germany/ Austria - easily
Everywhere else - couldn't do it

England are usually the butt of our jokes
(wasn't a similar question asked like 2 days ago
England
Just like the Irish, and the Scots, and the French, and the Germans, and the Spanish, and the Australians, and the New Zealanders, and the South Africans etc etc etc
&#x200B;
I can't remember any specific jokes, but it's mostly about their perceived self-righteousness and how they're viewed from the rest of Europe
My small ~1,000 population village that I grew up in, perfectly fine, chances are if the pub isn’t open you won’t pass anyone, which I guess can make you feel unsafe in a different sort of way
Cardiff definitely has some sketchy alleys and areas, if you aren’t a local you might get targeted but I’m a tall guy and the most I’ve had is some homeless people asking for money, which isn’t particularly threatening to me
If it’s a weekend night there’s hordes of drunk people, but if you just keep your head down and pass by they won’t even register you
Again, could be different for a woman sadly
Walking with female friends in this situation they have been both groped and spat on
Both by the same sort of guy
I did give them a piece of my mind but they obviously don’t really care, plus I’m not really one to get in a fight but those were probably the closest I’ve come to it
All my experiences with walking at night in Cardiff have been right in the city centre though, no quieter areas
Bristol is not too different to Cardiff in areas
There’s some areas that I’d say are perfectly safe at all hours, then others that have one or two sketchy people walking about but they’re more likely to start a weird conversation and just make you uncomfortable more than threaten violence
I’d say there’s around 1/3rd of the city that seems safe based on mine and my female friends testimonies
I live in London
I mover here aged 23 and have wandered most areas at night for the last 20 years
I've never had a problem
I was pickpocketed on a bus once
Apart from that nothing
I've never felt unsafe, even in so called unsafe areas
However, I've had all the usual stupidity women get from men
Not usually so much any more
And apart from comments nothing in the streets, bit touching etc on buses and in bars
But that said I am white, an adult and while being a woman brings its own set of problems it probably also protects me from other stuff
So it's relatively safe for me, but I wouldn't be a young, black man in some areas
Like Ireland, we have a Harp as our National Symbol
The harps are different, however
The "Welsh Harp/Triple Harp" has 3 rows of strings in comparison to the usual 1
Pretty sure ours is the same thing
And if not then I guess I’d say our voices
You seem much more in the know about Welsh music than I am about Irish
You’re name reminded me of something actually that’s only partly related
My sister was in The [Eurovision Choir contest] last year in Gothenburg and I was gonna say maybe that proves your point but my sister’s also a harpist so maybe she’s not the best example to use haha
Yeah I think you’re right there
I probably don’t have the best POV as my family’s pretty musical but I think in general it’s not exactly a go to genre for many people
Join couch surfing and hang out with locals during your stay
That we are overrun by muslims and don't have freedoms
That we don't need to drive because we have good public transport everywhere
My village has one bus route between the 2 towns either side of it, it runs hourly for about 13 hours a day, 6 days a week
No buses anywhere after 1920 in the evening, and nothing on Sundays
There is a train service, again it's only hourly
Even going anywhere reasonably 'local' like Chester, Liverpool or Manchester requires at least one change of train
We've always perpetuated that idea ourselves though, mainly because travelling to 'Europe' involves a ferry crossing, flight, or more recently, a train journey
oui
I heard Chinese businesses pay white men to be living furniture to make the business seem better or more multicultural than it is
Some of them even sit in meetings
[Not really]
A lovely townhouse really
[For example] My family house cost us around £120,000, and our one before that my parents bought for £60,000 or so when I was born
A house like the one linked is not very achievable for people in my area, you’d need at least 10% deposit and need to pay a lot per month on a mortgage
I went to Munich in summer 2019 and had a brilliant time
Went to all those spots
Got the train down to one of the nearby lakes
Would go to the area any time again, didn’t feel like I got “tourist trapped” at all apart from watching that clock in the centre but that was free anyway so I didn’t really mind
Spoke to a few locals too and everyone was super helpful
Welsh animals have a few of these literal names
Hamster is “bochdew”, literallly fat-cheek
Fox can be “llwynog”, literally bushy
Hedgehog is “draenog”, literally thorny
Caterpillar is “sîani flewog”, literally furry Jenny
Ladybird is “buwch goch gotta”, literally small red cow
Turtle is “crwban”, literally little hump
Squid is “môr-lawes”, literally sea-sleeve
Dragonfly is “gwas y neidr”, literally snake’s servant
And as I said in my other comment jellyfish can be
“Pysgod wibli wobli”, literally wibbly wobbly fish or “cont y môr”, c*nt of the sea
There is a more formal name but it’s not as fun
Two Welsh terms for Jellyfish are “Pysgod wibli wobli” (for kids), meaning wibbly wobbly fish, and “Cont y môr” which is c*nt of the sea
Well, I think the actual word is meicrodon but there’s the jokey one popty-ping
Think it’s along the lines of calling a tv remote something like a flicker etc
Edit:Typo
I think the standard word for it is “Sglefren fôr” which is sort of like slippery sea thing
Those two are used in colloquial speech
I’m not fluent though, and I have also heard that a lot of animals in Welsh have many dialectal names, so there could easily be another 2 or 3 words for jellyfish, just picked the two most interesting
Additionally, I wonder how often jellyfish comes up in a formal/polite setting, documentaries perhaps
Cribbing much of this from [

There is a town in mid-Wales called Newtown
It was founded in the late 13th Century, under the Welsh name *Y Drenewydd*. It was officially designated as a [New Town] in 1967
>Australia is known for having very bland names for slot of places
Dude you Aussies have fantastic names for places, places like Humpybong, Burpengary, Wonglepong
Thats mental, it's as if you Aussies where shitfaced when you where naming places
I can think of three Newports off the top of my head; [two] of [them] are at least 800-900 years old, and [the third] is about 50 miles from the sea
I've only ever driven past it, tbh
Port Talbot is worse, with the steelworks
I wonder if residents of the 2 Newports in Wales ever get mis-addressed post
As someone from the UK:
yep this guy gets it
Garlic dip is very common
A drizzle of chilli or garlic oil too
At home I’ll put some hot sauce over it too
I’ll answer this for Australia because even though I don’t live there now, it’s where I’ve been most of my life and I know it best
Pros: good universities, universal healthcare, multicultural immigration means lots of good food, amazing coffee culture, some of the world’s nicest old theatres and cinemas
People tend to be chill
Cons: unstable and chaotic politics, very high cost of living, employment drought (especially compared to the UK), summers are painfully hot, culture of misogyny can be very pervasive, overcrowded public transport, weird accents

I used to teach Visual Basic here in Wales and using Dim to declare variables was confusing for anyone Welsh speaking
Dim means no/none in Welsh
Yeah, I'm a guy and about half of my friends are female
Its completely normal especially once you get into your late teens/ early twenties and beyond
It's quite difficult to define when Wales was founded, as Wales was a collective of regions ruled by princes
However, the first person to unify all of Wales and become the first Prince of Wales was Gruffydd ap Llewellyn, also known as Llewellyn the Great, in 1055, and was first recognised by the English to be the King of Wales, which is seen to be the date that Wales was founded
Iran just has OP geography
If we were buying drywall most builders merchants and DIY stores in the UK would deliver those sort of items to your house
If we needed to move a couch or similar we know several people with vans, as others have said you could also hire one for a day, there are van rental companies everywhere in the UK too
If you are ordering a large enough amount it’s almost always delivered
We do have a trailer as well that we’ve used for sand
It’s just not feasible to drive a pickup around since they cost so much more to run, and take up so much space
I don’t think we could even park anywhere in my town really
We also know some people who would lend us a van, which are far more space efficient
Old towns and cities rarely have spaces that pickup trucks can comfortable operate on
We have one drywall wall in our house that we had to put in ourselves
It was delivered to our house
It’s not a functional building material here, and I finally understood how Americans “punch holes in walls” only around a year ago
Of course it’s a viable building material when you are in certain conditions, but as others have said, most houses here are 70s and earlier
Mine is 1950s. I wouldn’t like to think what a piece of drywall would look like after 70 years, especially when this house was unoccupied for over 5 of them
Sort of, we had some mandatory “Home Economics” lessons for 3 years in Secondary school
I remember making a salad, cake, pasta thing and maybe a pizza
There was an option to continue this into a Catering and Hospitality qualification but I didn’t.
Having moved to uni I have learned to cook a lot more things, and looking at some peoples cooking ability who I’ve lived with, makes me think perhaps more lessons or needed
We had to make smoothies and stuff like that in secondary school, but it didn't help me
I still can't cook anything that isn't "just stick it in the oven and wait half an hour"
IIRC, Home Economics was part of our Design Technology 'rotation', so we'd do maybe half a term of it then swap to woodwork and so on
It was an optional subject past Year 9 (ages 13 - 14) and I don't think a single boy took it then
I dropped all of them, I'm not the most practical sort
I was at school in the 90s so I don't think we really had an equivalent of IT
It was the first half of the 90s so the computers were all old Apple Macs, no copies of Word here
Ah, the place I work at now has fitted wifi everywhere, and departments that need their own computers have to buy their own laptops and trollies to keep them in
The kids find new and fun(!) ways to fuck the laptops up every other week :(
We had a PC in every classroom over 10 years ago, IIRC
Now, when I was at school all registers were still paper, lol
30 minute walk to university, quite hilly which is a pain

Those who speak a minority language/dialect, where's the most unusual place (real or digital) you've seen your language
This doesn't include English, French, German, Spanish or Italian but doesn't **exclude** them e.g. if you find French graffiti in a toilet in a shitty area in a city in the Brazilian interior, that would be unusual
Someone in the US painted cofiwch dryweryn on a big rock (about a Welsh village that was flooded to provide water to english cities)

No offense meant by this, but if his voters aren't racist, why do they vote for a politician with racist views and policies
Like here the vast majority of voters for BXP, ou populist hard right party are either racists or nationalists are usually proud
I guess it depends where you are
In the south and South Wales I don’t hear it very often
Seems to get more common the further north aha
Scottish people and northerners seem to shy away from it less
Also while it’s still a harsh swearword (to my ears) I definitely hear it thrown around more as a genuine insult more than in America (when visiting and in media)
Better looking than our people ;)
I really should stop saying south like I know the whole south
Only been to London twice

Some people even write on the potatoes
I’ve been to a few more modern pubs here and they serve them as a side
Any decent tapas restaurant has croquetas here also
Only really known of them in the last ~3 years though
I think the difference is that a boterham doesn't have the top slice of bread - it's stuff *on* bread instead of *between* bread
Are they not croquettes which are the slightest bit different
Had them too mind
Wouldn't you
I think I'm going to have to Google this, because I can't see how differ-

That we were happy to be taken over and didn't exactly revolt against the new rule all too much, I s'pose

Also just a point, we still don't have universal suffrage

A few UK breweries will produce Christmas-themed beers, but there's nothing specific that I can think of
Beers like Shepherd Neame's [Christmas Ale] for example
I think Wychwood Brewery will produce a Christmas variant of their 'Hobgoblin' beer, too
I had some Christmas beer last year at a local pub, but I can’t remember any names
It was a red ale and it was some joke on Rudolph’s nose
It’s not classic in the UK but I think craft breweries are starting to get onboard as an reason to experiment
We had that last year, I've been wondering if they'll bring it back
Yeah, it's a good time for breweries to try some new beers out, they can experiment a bit
Tokyo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Toyota, Kobe, Sakai, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagasaki,  Bingo, Satsuma, Fukushima, Hiroshima, Nagoya, Ome, Awaji, Settsu, Kobe, Fuji, Suzuka
Theres probably a few candidates:
Boris Johnson (although he is also probably the most loved at the same time as being the most hated)
Daniel Kawczynski
Nigel Farage
Priti Patel
Jeremy Corbyn
Margaret Thatcher (hell will freeze over before people here forget what that woman did to Wales)
Not as much as in England but Labour did lose support here under him and the right hate him as much as in England
To be honest I just included him in case I got accused to being biased to the left haha
I like your version better than my idea of being a warning to others
I suspect we'll be sidelined in some areas but in others will continue to inevitably be part of our continent

Cromwell's relationship with Parliament was a tumultuous one
Let's never forget that he helped preside over a military purge of parliament (removal not murder of MPs) and then later when he was in charge he himself used to army to shut down Parliament and replace it with MPs he preferred 3 times
Ah, I see
not quite the response I guess the O.P was expecting but I can definitely see why ya might think that way
For Wales I'd say the circumstances surrounding [the death of Carl Sargeant] a Labour politician in November 2017 (full disclaimer; he represented my constituency)
He committed suicide after being dismissed from the Welsh Government following allegations around his personal conduct - basically his name came up when the #MeToo scandal hit UK politics in 2017
At the last count there were 3 inquiries ongoing following all this, into 1) his death, 2) if there was bullying in the Welsh Government, and 3) if the First Minister at the time, Carwyn Jones, breached the ministerial code when he sacked Mr Sargeant from the Welsh Government

Bus trains aren’t normal
\* Bus body on a 4-wheeled freight wagon chassis
150s are fine IMO - but yes, as they’ve installed accessible toilets on them recently they’ve lost maybe 12 seats in one carriage
In fact we’re about to get *two* lots of London’s cast-offs here in Wales
* Class 230s, rebuilt from [old London Underground trains]
* Class 769s, [old Thameslink trains] retro-fitted with Diesel engines
Me again
We exported most of the 141s [to *Iran*] Yes, Iran
They have since withdrawn them from service
Scotland's doing better than Wales in terms of rail at the moment, at least you guys get to decide which lines up there get electrified
We're reliant on the British Government who don't really give a shit about doing anything further west of Cardiff
Otherwise the main lines in the UK like the West and East Coast ones are pretty good, IMO
Technically the IoW order will be the third lot :P
The ones we're getting in Wales will be on my local line
The plan is for 3-car sets
The 2 cab cars will be fitted with battery packs and there will be 4 diesel gensets in the centre car
There is a vague plan to extend services to either Birkenhead or even Liverpool on battery power, with regenerative braking helping to recharge it during operation
Then have some kind of charging point installed at Wrexham General station
If they can pull it off it will massively improve services on my local line, especially if they can extend through to Liverpool
We don’t actually have electrified tracks in most of Wales, thanks to Westminster denying us that on several occasions despite our own government (and opposition) being in favour of it
Yes, the thinking from the British Government is that it avoids costly and disruptive elecxtrification schemes
In reality the first batch of these trains in running several months late as the conversion is delayed because it's harder than they thought
There are a few prototypes but they're not really running yet
Third rail electrification is not loved as it's massively inefficient compared to overhead, but bolting a Ford transit engine to a rebuilt D stock underground train is seen as easier any day of the week
The D stock is delayed as they make sure they don't catch fire and can work, the 769 programme is diababolical and is testament to why new build is better than modifying current stock
TfW, Northern and GWR train are late and no set time for delivery
Sticking to the original topic of the post, ordering food in Pete's Eats in Llanberis
North Wales so everyone speaks Welsh, managed to fumble my way through in what I've learned through Duolingo but heck, it's a whole new world
> The D stock is delayed as they make sure they don't catch fire and can work, the 769 programme is diababolical and is testament to why new build is better than modifying current stock
TfW, Northern and GWR train are late and no set time for delivery
Yeah, I can't help but think ordering more CAF units or FLIRTs instead of the 769s would have been better here in Wales
Or just keep the 175s instead - there don't seem to be any takers for them yet
At least our D-Stock will be battery hybrid ones
One of my biggest regrets is dropping Welsh as a subject circa 1994 or so when I chose my GCSE options - as you could do back then
Might jump on Duolingo and see how I go
In theory the 769 project is sound, but it's got to the point where if it was a dog it would be out down
The 175's are sound units and the refurb will see them through another 10 years
However they catch fire easily in the heat and I don't think anyone would want to have them
GCSE Welsh isn't bigged up in the right way to make people pay attention
When you've got a dozen other exams to do it sort of falls behind
Duolingo is class and highly recommend, stick at it you'll pick it back up easily
> The 175's are sound units and the refurb will see them through another 10 years
However they catch fire easily in the heat and I don't think anyone would want to have them
Precisely why we should keep them, IMO
Leave them on things like Holyhead - Cardiff and Holyhead - Manchester
Agree with you re: 769s too
> GCSE Welsh isn't bigged up in the right way to make people pay attention
When you've got a dozen other exams to do it sort of falls behind
It was optional before 1999 - German and French made more sense back then as Welsh hadn't really had the revival it had now

Electrified railways
We've only got Cardiff-Severn Tunnel electrified (30-40 miles), there were plans to take it to Swansea but they got postponed
by the government
Fully agreed on this - I'd also like better North - South transport links as I have family in Carmarthenshire
I look at Scotland with some envy - they have 4 lines between Edinburgh and Glasgow, and have electrified all of them
They have the power to carry out their own electrification, so add Stirling and Dunblane to that list
We couldn't even get the Government to electrify the line to our *second city*...
Meanwhile we have to pay for HS2, which I broadly support, but electrifying Cardiff - Swansea and the Valley Lines would have been a nice trade-off there
Me too
The valley lines are getting transferred to Transport for Wales and should all be electrified by 2023
(Otherwise the we lose the EU funding for it)
Support HS2 as well, probably a better trade off would be electrify Crewe-Chester-Holyhead
The Avanti services can switch to electric and direct link to HS2
Electrics to Swansea will happen, eventually
Mayo haters unite
> The valley lines are getting transferred to Transport for Wales and should all be electrified by 2023
(Otherwise the we lose the EU funding for it)
I thought that was just 2 or 3 lines north of Cardiff
>Support HS2 as well, probably a better trade off would be electrify Crewe-Chester-Holyhead
The Avanti services can switch to electric and direct link to HS2
I agree on that, too
Even just doing Crewe - Holyhead would help
I know there are a lot of bridges on Crewe - Chester but the new Hitachi trains can at least switch to diesel then
You are right sorry, I thought it was Barry and Penarth as well, just everything north of Cardiff Central
With the problems they've overcome wiring through the Severn Tunnel and the low bridge taking the tracks over the mainline to Queen Street, they'll probably find a way
> You are right sorry, I thought it was Barry and Penarth as well, just everything north of Cardiff Central
IIRC they are electrifying the Queen Street - Cardiff Bay line too, or converting it to electrified light rail
>With the problems they've overcome wiring through the Severn Tunnel and the low bridge taking the tracks over the mainline to Queen Street, they'll probably find a way
I don't doubt it
That said there are about 60 bridges between Crewe and Chester IIRC

But on a flight to the US, you had these fuckers giving a standing ovation for the pilots landing
This sounds like the most realistic idea I've read on this post
A federal europe where all European states keep their own laws, military taxes and socio-economic standards in their own control but have a federal oversight and federal laws that they all have to adhere too would probably be the best way to run it
A similar set up to the U.S would be most likely
It's going to be great when we have to go ahead with it anyway
Interesting
Purely anecdotal but I’ve been going to the same Villa in Portugal since I was a kid
Fairly rural type place
There are quite bright lights illuminating the main path down
When we were kids I use to push my sister near the light as it would be absolutely swarming with bugs and insects
A fun game to terrify your sister for life I’m sure you’ll agree
The last few summers and it was completely dead
Not a single flying creature on any of the lights the entire week
Such a stark contrast it was impossible not to notice
[Tŷ Hyll] (Ugly House) in North Wales is an example of a Tŷ Unnos (one night house)
Law said anyone could claim a freehold if they could build a house and get a fireplace burning in one day, with the boundaries of the property determined by how far the owner could throw an axe
It was apparently built in the 15th Century and is still going strong (as a tearoom these days)
I'd have to say [Conwy Castle] or [Caernarfon Castle] for Wales, maybe [St David's Cathedral] too
For modern buildings I quite like a lot of the newer buildings in Cardiff - [The Senedd] (our Parliament) and the [Millennium Centre]

In the UK there was a strong media response, with [scary public information films] and even entire [television shows] informing the public about AIDS
A lot of the early cases were among the gay community, so unfortunately there was quite a stigma associated with the disease there
Despite the amount of public information campaigns being broadcast in the late 1980s, it took Diana, Princess of Wales being photographed [shaking hands with an AIDS patient] to actually dispel many of the myths around how the disease was transmitted
Of course, one of the most high profile deaths from AIDS in the UK occurred in 1991 when Freddie Mercury, lead singer of Queen, passed away
The death of [Terry Higgins]  in 1982, led to the founding of [The Terrence Higgins Trust] a charity which continues to fundraise for research into AIDS, and support sufferers and their families, to this day
Thanks for the link - I wasn't aware of Fowler's push to get the campaign started, but he deserves major credit for it, yeah
[This article] suggests it was the first Government supported AIDS awareness campaign anywhere in the world at the time
Michael Portillo helping to save the Settle - Carlisle railway line from closure, when he was Transport Secretary, is my personal favourite example
> But wasn't his action literally "conservative" in conserving the service
To a degree, yeah
I don't see it as fitting with the Conservative Party's ideas of the free market though
Remember Thatcher was [alleged to have once said] “A man who, beyond the age of 26, finds himself on a bus can count himself as a failure"
>Also he came out as a train spotter after he left parliament
Yes, it's sometimes easy to forget he was a politician
He's been doing the railway journeys shows for 10 or 11 years now I think

There is a little thing in the way called the universal declaration of human rights
>No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property
That's not even mentioning the fact that most people would surely rather see the land in the hands of people offering it at a very low rent, then sold off to a certain party's rich cronies (who'll charge a fortune for rent) whenever they next end up in government

Aye, oddly enough it tastes pretty good with ice cream too
Kinda reminds me of having waffles and ice cream for some weird reason
Damn wtf
Accurate to a point, the welsh stole the sheep because the english used to prevent the welsh sheep from being fertile by fucking it and lower the price of wool by basically jizzing in the wool
So the welsh stole them back and took the punishment for shagging a sheep instead of getting caught stealing one
For ny country and for my people
But wait my celtic friend, can we both agree that the english are the real enemy, the ones who started this whole sheep shag thing
It would fuck up the womb and the human sperm would try and do its job but ofc there is a sheeps egg instead causing it to mutate and kick out an abomination leading to damage to the sheeps genitals

I believe it was my Great Great Uncle was an Engineer in North Africa in WW2
I never got the stories first hand because he died long before I was born
But essentially, he and his fellows would "wash" a tank out after it came back knocked out
Essentially they'd fill the tank with water so all the bits and pieces of former crew and tank would get out of the nooks and crannies
Then they'd open the bottom escape hatch and wash it all out the bottom
Just a little bit grim
Another one of my ancestors fought in WW1
I only saw a card he sent back to his family
He wasn't a member of my direct family, and uncle of somesuch
Don't know if he survived or not
I think he did, thankfully
My grandfather was just a child during the Blitz, but he says he remembers the sky glowing red over the horizon of the valley from the direction of Swansea, when it was essentially wiped from the map in 3 days
Wasn't rebuild until the 60s really
He still holds a grudge against the government for that; that they didn't help them out more after the war
It's not really a very important historical event but my great great great great uncle wrote the first Welsh bible

It's been a while since I was in our education system, but I'm pretty certain from hearing my younger cousin talking about his history GCSE that they still only really teach from Elizabethan/industrial revolution times through to WW2 in history classes
I think there'd be a lot more interest in it as a subject and an extracurricular activity if they taught ancient history, early medieval history, ancient world history and all the way up until the end of the Vietnam war
So many more options than <200 years of British history and nothing else

Dw i'n hoffi coffi
I like coffee
After struggling for years, I went with "be ti ishe fi dweud
Dwy allu dweud unrhywbeth yn Gymraeg" which roughly translates to "What do you want me to say
I can say anything in Welsh".
Normally that's enough to prove to whoever's asking that I can speak the language
&#x200B;
And yes, I also get asked for Llanfair P.G.
It's like the equivalent of our citizenship test - you say the entirety of that, you're one of us
I’ve done this with the Welsh of this

Oh, learning it took a lot of practice, lol

It's a place name, basically a list of stuff about waterfalls and a church that are near the town
The town had its name lengthened in the 1800s to attract tourists
In fact, there's still a cafe and gift shop by the railway station today, it's an easy stop for tour coaches on the way to Holyhead
Nice, I always have to Google what it means :P
IIRC none of the places named are actually near the village
Yup, got that bookmarked for these threads too :P
No, this is just a bunch of places mashed together for tourism purposes
Keeps your town relevant in Victorian times and stuff

It's the [longest station sign] in the UK, maybe Europe, IIRC
I'm not sure whether it was renamed just for that, although they did have a 'rivalry' with a [station in mid-Wales] for the longest name
Apart from the sign and the cafe / gift shop next to it, it's a rather unremarkable place tbh
Oh lol
I think I remember the news story about that now you mention it
Thanks
Yeah, the locals just call it Llanfairpwllgwyngyll I think
Yes, England
Give us Independance
Wales would like to be left alone thanks
I can recall visiting Sweden in the 80's and there were a lot of jokes (i didnt get) about Finish submarines
Don't mention The Canary Islands
Movement started at a low 6% now rising up to 40% faster than scotlands movement once it started
We have no choice once Scotland leaves
Because  you lot send droves of pensioners our way to swing our elections in your favour
You know, the English did a lot of bad things in the past to Wales, many along the same as the irish experienced , "Brits" is an unfortunate term when its basically being used to describe The English
Term not teem
Turin - Italy's 'car' city and home of Fiat
Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, too
Canberra, though most Brits forget it's the capital
Then random places like  Cairns and Newcastle
Can't forget Bathurst
I have been to Oberhausen (it is a city which is the home of wXw Wrestling) and whilst I had a great time I think I got done exploring the city on the first morning
I know of all those cities
Toulouse - mainly because Airbus have a lot of their final assembly lines there
Lyon - was at the other end of the first high-speed rail line built in France
There's a lot of domestic travel between the two cities
Lille - city in Northern France
If you go from London to Paris, you basically travel past it on the Eurostar from London or the Autoroute from Calais
Queanbeyan, NSW - Mark Webber was from there IIRC
Leeds is apparently "the largest city in Europe without any form of light rail or underground", per [Wikipedia]
IIRC they've had plans for a tram system scrapped *twice* now, by different Governments
The city centre has undergone massive redevelopment in the last 20, 25 years or so
It's a nice place to visit, IMO
A lot of us Brits have a negative view of Birmingham because we only see the [post-industrial areas] of the city's suburbs as you drive past it on our motorway network
True - I was thinking more of mass-produced stuff with Fiat
Yr Ymerodraerh Awstria-Hwngariaidd
Ymerodraeth Awstria-Hwngari (Welsh)
Ooh boy
Pretty much all of their positions
Our extended family live both in Yorkshire and others down in the South East while we live in Wales
There was such contention about Tea vs Supper vs Dinner, my family big brained it and enforced "Swper", the Welsh word for the evening meal
No more arguments anymore
I've done Chester to Rome by train before now
As we were on holiday, we made a 'journey' out of it and had overnight stops in Paris and Milan
Except warfilms, then all germans are just clone soldiers
> The fact that it somehow took 2 weeks to travel from Dingle to Dublin in “Leap Year
Ironically that gave a reasonably neutral depiction of South Wales when the flight landed at the wrong airport
IIRC the accents of the check-in staff were reasonably correct
Green still means it takes a [phonecard] right
Haven't you got city-wide fibre to the premises now, though
> i use 3 colors: red, green and blue
but which colour are the salt & vinegar crisps
I had to read it twice to get the Tardis link tbh, and as my link shows Phonecards are a thing of the past now too
Ah, so the network is complete at least
The monopoly status is a bit weird, I do agree
I'm surprised the satellite providers are still going
I can’t ride a bike
I tried to learn when I was about 10 and then at about 15
No luck
Doesn’t help I have poor balance and trip over air
I don’t know what age but definitely under 10
We used to go on family bike rides around the lanes where I grew up, and pop into a pub for lunch or dinner and then cycle back
Haven’t ridden one in over 5 years when I rode all my families over from my old house
I had one for a few months when I was about 6-7, but never got the hang of balancing on it
It eventually kind of became my little brother's bike by silent agreement
As a welsh man i would fully back that story, although some of the basis of old welsh/celtic mythology is hard to get a hold of, its always fun to expand and think of the types of powers that would be given by the gods
Yeah i see where your coming from, makes sense
Thats why the celtic essence is good, its a videogame after all not based on fact, so potentially the irish druid can come to the aid of the welsh, or the welsh to the cornish, but thats the fiction element  of it not the fact which would be the roman invasion
We shag all sheep, not just the ones that eat leeks
I am firm in the belief that Neville Chamberlain was a disaster
I'd go even further and blame the Conservative party for the war
War was inevitable either way and the policy of appeasement was intended to but time for Britain to remilitarise
But if we had gone to war with the Rhineland then despite being much weaker, Germany would've been much more weaker
It's difficult to predict how a war in 1936 would've gone, but I'm fairly certain Britain and France would've been much more powerful relative to Germany
Literally everything
The empire, the Napolenic era, the Elizabethans, the hundred years war, the Saxons, the celts
Absolute nutters can't get enough
In Wales -
Owain Glyndŵr’s Revolt
He was the last native Welshman to hold the (self proclaimed) titled of Prince of Wales, and he lead a rebellion that spanned ~13 years
They romanticise it because they want a repeat revolt, or something
England - uh
British Empire, probably
Tudors get talked about a lot too, as well as William the Conqueror
Although that's mostly Britain as a whole
For the welsh it's kinda hard to romanticise much after the medieval period
Yes, but they love to wank off to agincourt, which tbf was pretty cool
An army of undersupplied, exhausted infantry and bowmen managed to defeat the crime of the French army including a fuck ton of cavalry
Easy to see why they love it
Not a city, but I nominated [Port Talbot] as Wales' ugliest town last time we did this, and I'll stand by that
The elevated section of the M4 motorway linking South Wales with London cuts above the town and in the distance is the steelworks
It's a major employer for the area but when it's operating that stretch of the motorway stinks of sulphur and it's always dominating the horizon
There was an explosion there a few years ago when some molten steel was spilled and exposed to water while it was being transported, nobody was seriously hurt but somebody captured this utterly apocalyptic [dashcam footage]
you mean Port Toilet
Yeah, the last few seconds really look like a nuke's gone off
Yup, the ending looks like a proper mushroom cloud after a nuke
Should have taken the One Ring there haha
No my accent is quite neutral, people are normally surprised when I tell them I'm Welsh
People say I don’t sound Welsh and then spend all their time telling me I pronounce words like tooth and saucepan wrong so I guess
Yes, no matter where in the UK I go
Even on the continent people have a hard time understanding me, and trying to explain your from Wales is even harder
Nothing super crazy and never been to the police
I’ve had plenty of people threaten me, a guy punched me in the stomach in Germany but it was shit and I just pushed him away and left
A guy grabbed me by the throat here but his friends dragged him away
A guy spat on my friend as we walked passed and he tried to fight me
I got punched in the back of the head in a nightclub because I walked into what I thought was space but turned out to be a fight
Somebody grabbed my ass in a pub once, but it was crowded enough that I couldn't tell who
Nothing else comes to mind
[Genod Droog "Dal Ni Lawr"]  - Welsh language Rap video set in a badminton court
Goldie Lookin Chain [Your Missus is a Nutter]  and many others including [Auf  Wiedersehen Mate]  a sad one about Brexit with the video really capturing the vibe of the UK before joining the EU
Also [Bonnie Tyler]  and [Shakin Stevens]
Germany ain't called the fatherland it's just some American heritage shit
When a Russia and Germany love each other they invade each others space until out pops a little Poland
Never seen one like that before, but to be fair, I don't try to open windows everywhere I go
Not in my house but they're for sale at pretty much every window place
My sister's patio doors did that
More UK Youtubers than Welsh ones, but:
* 'All The Stations'
* Geoff Marshall
* Tom Scott
* bigclivedotcom
EDIT:
* Techmoan
Gonth is the only Welsh one I know
He was basically Welsh KSI/ W2S and I think he stopped a while back
Luke Birch - UK based, focuses on education type videos, very funny
TomSka - creator of asdfmovie
Daniel Howell & Phil Lester
clickfortaz- welsh youtuber and is honestly amazing
Both the channels he's involved with are good at showing you bits of the UK you hadn't thought about
I liked his point about *All The Stations*. If the video still exists in 20, 30 years it'll be a cool snapshot of how the UK and its railways were in 2017
I've always had an interest in trains and railways so seeing far-flung rural stations isn't too dull for me :P
I’d say it’s more of a thing you do the first time you meet somebody in the UK
Or when you’re congratulating someone
Well we have Welsh which is our joint official language with English and is spoken by roughly a quarter of the population
Yes
Public transport in my village is very unreliable and quite expensive
Car is the only practical way of travelling
I can cope without one but life would be easier with a car, yeah
I can commute to work by train and the only issue with the bus services in my village is how early they stop
There's nothing after 7:15pm or so, and no service at all on Sundays
Otherwise the nearest large city is easily reachable by bus (or train), if I went there for a night out though I'd have to get a taxi home from the next town over
Buses are generally rubbish where I live - expensive, unreliable and routes can be changed or withdrawn at 2 week's notice
I live 15 minutes walk away from the city centre though and 35 minutes walk away from work so I just walk everywhere
It wouldn't be much faster by car once you've factored in traffic jams and parking
Shame about the 20% gradient to get home so I'm thinking of getting an electric bike
The only official language of the UK is Welsh
You can shoot a welshman in Chester with a bow after midnight
Pre 0ad isn’t as uncommon as you might imagine as there are loads of standing stones at least here in South Wales
Same here with pre Roman invasion
We do have some of that ogham (I think that’s it’s name) on standing stones here so there is a bit but not much
I wasn’t taught anything other than the fact that we were in the EU
The average persons knowledge of what the EU is and how it works here is undoubtedly as poor as mine, if not poorer
I know a few things from reading around because of brexit
For context, I’m a 22 year old university student, the vote was before I was old enough too, and no one I’ve met has seemingly understood the EU
I’ll leave it to everyone else to interpret whether or not that was a well and honestly informed vote
Cash, contactless bank card, or by buying a ticket through the transport company's own app (Arriva for buses, Transport for Wales for trains)
EDIT: I buy a 'carnet' of 12 single tickets through TfW's app, for my daily commute by train
This saves me a few £ a week compared to just buying paper tickets with cash
For busses I use contactless card
For trains I'll buy them online and collect at the station
Eventually the plan is for all tickets to be available with a smart card
For Transport for Wales (TfW) it's currently only weekly tickets between Wrexham and Shrewsbury, the South Wales valleys, and Swansea to Cardiff, we don't want to overload the system and watch it all fall to bits
If your smart card has a logo that looks like three little sausages, you can use to buy tickets in other parts of the UK where their smart cards have the same logo
So I could buy a ticket for a south western journey with a TfW smartcard
All slowly coming together
The way forward will eventually be mobile, smartcard, and the massive toilet paper style tickets the conductor prints out
The problem with QR codes (etickets) is that the same code will work at the barrier until flagged by staff which is why they are trying to get phased out
So if a group want to travel cheaply, one person buys a ticket and they either share a copy of the PDF or print it out a few times
Mobile tickets need to be activated and as to be displayed through the app to be valid, which gives it some extra protection against fare evasion
In my experience, QR codes don't take too long to scan compared to normal card tickets but if the screen is cracked or dirty, or not even full brightness it may not work
Smartcards can have problems downloading the ticket to the card so it's not perfect, but will eventually become the norm
What part of England is that in
This is more of an outside of Europe problem, if they have even heard of Wales at all
I understand people from far away not knowing Wales, but it's more baffling when they haven't heard of UK or Britain, but know England
Yeah that's definitely the case, especially outside of Europe
And I've got to admit, even I call her The Queen of England
But God help anyone that implies that a Welsh, Scottish or Irish (N or R) person is English
That's the one they used to use to catch spies, isn't it
Now you know why we have this flag
[this week we gained the record for the steepest street in the world, replacing a street in New Zealand as number one
At first i wasn't that sympathetic as NZ always beat us (Wales) at rugby so i felt we were due a win but given the terrible week they've had (losing the cricket world cup final in heartbreaking fashion) i find myself feeling a bit bad
Rugby, in most of the UK and Ireland, but we don't really have violence amongst fans
Our entire history
They just teach us about England and shoehorn one some comment about Wales
I make a point to try and watch foreign language shows, they are quite easy to watch in the UK as the BBC and Channel 4 tend to broadcast the best of them
The shows I have watched that have been remade in English, in the main have been less enjoyable
A great example is The Bridge , much of the charm comes from it being set somewhere so different, reproduce it in the bloody channel tunnel and it's lost everything I loved about it
So none for me
I liked how it was portrayed in the World War Z book, where the UK and Ireland returned in some way to mediaeval weaponry due to lots being stored away in museums and private collections
Additionally the amount of castles allowing survivors to hole up in spots around the country
I sometimes think "its always sunny" could have been a little bit better
I'm glad you disagree with that, but it's not what OP said
&#x200B;
They said that the claim that Brits used to sound like Americans and now do not is a spurious one
I.e. that in what is now Britain, the accent used to be what is now American
This is
nuts
Ah the italian trump
Its odd, ever since he left office the world has become a total basket case
Necrophilic beastiality is pretty nasty no doubt about  that
But savile beats cameron to the post
Fun fact, they are both tories
Make of that what you will
Thats an incredibly fair point tbh
Bet they would be BFF's if they ever met
Not quite the same but I can only listen to rap and hip hop in French specifically because I can't understand the lyrics
Disgusting lyrics put me off
Besides the occasional 'merde' I can't tell in French so it let's me enjoy the sounds
No, only heard of things like that in American serial killer movies
Not really
I went to some weekend camp thing with brownies as a kid but that's about it
I know schools round here sent year 5s to Llangrannog every year
They've been doing that at least since I was that age
Personally, I never got to go because there weren't enough people going when it was my turn
Pretty much the same as a summer camp in terms of activities like high ropes and things
I think we also sent Year 6s out to Pendine to do beach activities
There's a couple residential activity centres a bit closer that schools from around the UK come to take part in
So summer camp might not be a thing but a residential activity week with school is definitely a thing
My friend goes to a Chriatian camp somewhere in Enlgand but he's very religious
Only another 699,949,999 to go :D
Probably Rhyl
Like many of the towns on the northern coast, massively popular seaside resort before it became cheaper to fly to a small Spanish island
Now it's a bit run down and faring worse than the other towns across the coast
Dragon Studios aka Valleywood on account of it being situated in the South Wales "Valleys" area
The anti-vax movement *started* in the UK, although Andrew Wakefield ultimately lost his British medical licence
Guillaume Batard
Eastern Germany
Before I went I had the preconceptions of former Communist concrete jungles and backwards attitudes, but its actually really lovely and I much preferred it to the South
The amount of time varies depending on how well the rugby team is doing haha
I’m there right now with family and have been all over NI, we go once a year to see family
Biggest trouble has been making sure to take a certain hat off on the wrong side of town
Few suburbs of certain cities when the flags are out can put me on edge but if you’re a tourist I doubt you’d be in that area or bothered by anyone
I’ve visited Liverpool 3 times, enjoyed myself for all of them
As long as you avoid the sketchy estates on the outskirts idk what people’s problem is
I for one haven’t heard of them
Poor guy, glad it turned out well for him
I've visited all 3 countries in the benelux and all were really nice
They feel oddly similar yet distinct at the same time
From my experience Luxembourg and Belgium felt more similar to eachother than to the Netherlands (but I only visited Eupen and Liege in Belgium so that is probably why)
The Netherlands feels really relaxed and laid back generally especially compared to the UK and Germany where I've lived
The pace of life there is just a bit less busy and manic I think
Luxembourg was very cosmopolitan and very multicultural (or at least Luxembourg City was)
It had a very nice mix between old and new and actually the way the older bit of the city looked reminded me a lot of Edinburgh
Its definitely an underrated city
As for Belgium, as I said I only visited Liege and Eupen so my insight isn't as well rounded as it is for the Netherlands, where I've visited multiple cities
Liege felt very French, or at least how I imagine France feels (I've never been there)
Along the river there was a very weird combination of buildings where every other building was a beautiful old 1700s looking building, but was surrounded on both sides by an ugly benidorm style block of flats
As for Eupen it was gorgeous and definitely felt more German (not just because thats what people were speaking)
The trains were a bit ugly and not as nice as in Germany/ Luxembourg/ Netherlands but there was a lot of building work going on while I was there so it felt like somewhere in progression
Yeah I enjoyed Liege but its probably one of those "once is enough" cities
I was warned beforehand to not bother with Liege so had low expectations
It was definitely better than people let on, but I can see why it has a not fantastic reputation
I'm hoping I'll get to visit Flanders sometime relatively soon (once covid is gone) so I'll be in a better position to make a definitive judgement about Belgium as a whole
I've wanted to go to Bruges ever since I saw the film set there
I've also heard good things about Ghent and Antwerp and I'd love to go to Baarle-Hertog
Definitely far from the worst city I've ever visited
*Macbeth* and *Of Mice and Men* were our GCSE texts
We read stuff like *Lord of The Flies*, *Animal Farm*, *Romeo and Juliet* and *An Inspector Calls* in Years 7 - 9
I lived in Germany for a year:
Achso, Tja, naja
Basically everyone quoting downfall
Ich ben main sei
[Dakota - Stereophonics]
Or literally any Tom Jones song
>we are mexicans
Whaaaaat
You telling me that there are people who are dumb enough to mix up Spaniards and Mexicans
That's pretty damn bonkers tbf
So don't mention the "British" Isles
Or two perticular drinks at the pub lol
Americans
Well that explains that then
American ignorance is kinds legendary tbh
Oh I'm sure Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK
More than enough , there's just a few here in Wales
Lots, mostly across England and Wales
I think I lost count before I even turned ten
Wales: too many to count but definitely Caerphilly, Chepstow, Raglan, Newport, Cardiff, Castell Coch, Coity, St Fagans, Abergavenny, Caldicot, Usk, Aberystwyth, Caerleon, Oxwich, Ogmore
England: Warwick, Nottingham, Tower of London, Alnwick, Bamburgh, Lindisfarne, Lincoln, Lancaster, Windsor, Norwich and probably loads more I don't remember
Scotland: Edinburgh
Germany: Neuschwanstein, Nordkirchen, Sparrenberg, Vischering
Probably a few more that I've forgotten too
Hungary: Budapest Citadella
Lost count, there’s about 6 small ones within 15 minutes of me
Some highlights of some slightly further away castles are:
[Cardiff Castle]
[Caerphilly Castle]
[Castell Coch]
There are 7 vowels in Welsh (a, e, i, o, u, w, y)
I have no idea if there is any words with all 7 (google isn't being helpful), but I think it would look weird
Nah with English anyway some of the accents and dialects from certain parts of the UK are harder than US/Canada/Aus/NZ accents
Not that hard, definitely not anywhere near the hardest in the UK
Scouse, Brum, Geordie and Glaswegian are all harder
I generally find Yorkshire to be alright (but then again I go to uni there), Lancashire can be okay in places but Scouse and Geordie are indecipherable
Generally not too bad but I've heard a few more difficult to understand ones
Sometimes you lot talk very quickly haha
[St Fagans] regularly wins awards for being a great museum
They’ve taken buildings from all ages and parts of Wales and moved them brick by brick to this outdoor museum
It’s just outside Cardiff and I’d recommend anyone to go
It’s great for kids and for adults
When we were young we went to the Victorian schoolhouse and acted out a Victorian school day
The visitors loved that aha
> The Imperial War Museum
IWM North in Manchester is pretty good too, as is the Museum of Science and Industry
Yeah, that's on my to-do list next time I get down to London
Would like to see an SR-71 up close
And here I was thinking I could do Tube + Bus
Bugger
Thanks for the tip
Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Northern Ireland
I suppose Ireland would be our neighbour
We in Wales don't share a border with the paddies but they are pretty close to us
A I'd need to do is take the Anglesea ferry and I'm in Dublin
London is a different beast to everywhere else
Cardiff is mostly a shithole
Having a few beers with my mates on the banks of the Rhine watching the sunset behind the Kölner Dom
Visiting Arnhem and Nijmegen
Really wanted to see the bridges from Operation Market Garden and the towns were also really nice
The pure novelty and beauty of Eupen
Had a lovely chat with some French dudes on the train from Germany
They even gave me one of their beers
I’m am from the British isles but I wouldn’t call myself British
It’s not a lack of understanding, we just don’t feel British is our culture (some of us)
The same way someone might feel Basque and not Spanish
Even though they are technically from Spain
Edit: Also, the Good Friday Agreement ruled legally that someone in NI has the choice to be British or Irish (or both) citizens
So it’s even more reasonable for someone in NI to consider themselves solely Irish and not from
Britain
You might have been but the original comment is whether being Welsh is the same as being British which isn’t true, so I took it to mean you were in agreement
Yeah, culture and technical geography are two different things is what it comes down to
You are what you identify with, doesn’t matter what arbitrary name someone else has given to wherever you live lol
Yes, the late great [Howard Marks] aka Mr Nice
Born in the South Wales valleys in the 1940s, he got into Oxford University, discovered cannabis there
Fast forward 20 years and he was moving tons of hash all over the world from Pakistan
He eventually got caught and jailed in Terre Haute penitentiary in America
I think he got sentenced to 25ish years but served 6
He returned to the UK in '96 and made a new career writing books about his life and doing one man shows etc
He died in 2016, a legend
They made a film about him called Mr Nice in 2010
[Interview with Mr Nice ]
Which way round do you question that figure
For me it seems more common than that, but then I’m in that 16-24 age group, so could be to do with that
Yeah I mean think of your parents/older family, I don’t think I know any of them who I would think even might’ve
I think I know of two or three over-40s who have
Compared to 20-30+ people my age lol
I think that’s not the guaranteed route really
Most people I know have just had it a few nights out
I don’t really know anyone who I would consider to have a problem with it but who knows
The issue is that drug users are criminalised
What are you supposed to do if you’re addicted
Drug users shouldn’t be arrested, they should be afforded therapy/rehab etc
It’s worked for Portugal
The war on drugs has been a failure here, should stop sending people to prison and start helping them solve their problems
I was under the impression that class A drugs were up in general but that drugs like heroin and opiates were down
I’ve only met one person who’s had heroin
Yeah I mean I would go as far to advocate that the state provide drugs to addicts so they don’t commit crimes to acquire them
Perhaps as a requirement they must attend therapy or rehab of sorts, after a certain number of purchases or something
There’s definitely some sort of balance to be had, but I would suggest most drug addicts don’t actually want to be addicted to drugs, even if they refuse help
They can get sold on but that’s not as bad as the current scenario
They can be investigated and caught if they’re lying
Drug dealers are certainly a problem, and I do think that should always be a crime of some degree, by obviously if there’s a legal way to acquire drugs then drug dealers would lose a significant part of their income
I think it would have to be gradual if they were to be fully legalised for consumption
There would have to be some way to limit or track people’s purchases as best as possible, requiring your name, address etc each time so it’s recorded
Only able to buy it in the daytime
Things could go the other way and people aren’t bothered with drugs since there’s no “underground drug culture” etc
Of course people will still take drugs “badly” and cause trouble, but if the education is there with how unhealthy and addictive they are, alongside the fact that you have to jump through a couple of hoops to acquire it would be enough to keep class A use to at least current figures
I doubt any significant changes in cannabis use would really matter, I personally don’t see it as anything negative
It’s on par with drinking if not generally safer
For me it’s a matter of time for that to be legalised
Class As, I’m not convinced they should be but I don’t think it would be some nightmare with everyone high all the time
If Wales was independent, Monmouthshire would be the most likely part of Wales to leave and join England
There used to be a political party that advocated Monmouthshire becoming part of England
We learnt that North Wales speaks a different dialect of Welsh to South Wales but we never learnt any of it
In terms of in English it was never even mentioned
From my friends who went to schools in England they weren’t even taught that Welsh was still a language or spoken
I'm a simple bloke,  so a chedder cheese and marmite sandwich with brown wholemeal bread is my favorate kinda sarnie tbh
It ain't fancy, but it is bloody tasty all the same
Ah now ya talking my language
Ya can't beat a good old crisp butty
Chuck some cheese spread in there and ya onto a winner
Then again you could alway mix it up and swap those walkers for a pack of those posh crisps like tyrells or kettle chips
They are a bit firmer than ya walkers but they add a decent crunch to the sarnie
Germany
I love northern Germany and find the south a bit stuffy and conservative (even though the scenery is gorgeous)
Never been to Austria or Switzerland but their accents are fucking indecipherable
Das ist genau was ich meine
Yeah Baden Württemberg isn't as bad as Bayern but I just find that I feel a lot more at home in NRW or Niedersachsen for example
Bitte schön :)
Not too bad, a day return from Bridgend to Cardiff is £6
10 which is 20 mins non stop, and there's plenty of options if you travel regular
Short distance is fine, usually quicker and cheaper than a bus or taxi
Long distance is when the algorithms get a bit funky
Best site to compare European train travel is seat61
com
Most stuff is concentrated in the far South, but a few things like the National Library are located roughly in the centre
There's actually more than I thought outside London, looking at your list
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch is in Derby, and IIRC at least part of the Office for National Statistics is in Newport, South Wales
There's definitely something passporty in durham
Might be regional though
Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales* and Shakespeare's *Macbeth* - both because of the older forms of English they were written in
I'm not finished with my country's program yet but it is particularly annoying that most of the books we study are from America
Britain and Ireland have such a wealth of literature, yet that is ignored in favour of American literature for some reason
They do not seem relevant to Britain or Europe
It wouldn't be as bad if the books were actually good but so far they seem to be mediocre and sub par, which just makes the choice to prioritise American books even more bizarre
Honestly, it was just reading it over and over again that did my head in
Yes, R&J was our Year 9 book, we did Macbeth for GCSE
Those who have traveled to other European countries, what stereotypes did you have that turned out to be totally wrong
Went to Italy
Drivers were not insane maniacs
Very disappointed, want refund
Edit: for everyone wondering where I went it was the Veneto region around lake Garda
I haven't really been to any countries where I had stereotypes/ preconceptions (only been to UK, Germany and Benelux though)
Most of my stereotypes are for the Mediterranean/ ex Soviet bloc Countries that I've never been to
Anyone who's kept in a basement for their whole lives :p
> In rome they are all maniacs
I swear to god i feared for my life every time i went into a taxi
Genoa was the only place where I thought the "Italians are all maniacs" stereotype had some truth to it
Even then it was nothing more than they were quick away from traffic lights
Wait for the green man and *don't* follow the locals because they know the timings of things
Not a problem really
Wasn't a lot of this viewpoint based on the Swiss national Military service model, where citizens are issued with an assault rifle which they effectively keep at home (with ammo) in case of invasion
Ah, looks like some of my info was wrong or out of date
Apologies, and thanks for the correction
First language is Welsh, but since leaving school I've primarily been speaking English
Now my Welsh is a lot poorer than it was and I've forgotten a boatload of words and their meanings
However there are still some words where I know the Welsh but not the English for it, some where I know the meaning but not the word and some where I know the word but not the meaning
I'm exactly the same
Although I feel strangely patriotic when I can only remember the Welsh word for something
Exactly the same for me, I've posted about it before too
Björk talking about her TV, specifically
Good point, brain fail, sorry
Haha
In Welsh we always just call our boy/girlfriends "my love". I like it, no ambiguity
There's no good word for annoying in Welsh, which is really annoying
> No, Poland, the ladder doesn’t *need* to be female
This [step ladder joke] won't work in Polish then
no thanks
I like winning the rugby
We did when I was growing up, but thats mostly because I have a large family and there isn't enough room for everyone on one table
Not at all and its quite common
I do it every day
Love this one
That is interesting, and unusual that some are in smaller cities like Kassel and Karlsruhe
In Welsh it follows the same pattern as many (especially Teutonic) European languages, except with some small alterations for masculine or feminine:
1 = un
2 = dau / dwy
3 = tri (m) / tair (f)
4 = pedwar (m) / (pedair (f)
20 = ugain
21 = un ar hugain
22 = dau / dwy ar hugain
23 = tri / tair ar hugain
24 = pedwar / pedair ar hugain
>21 = un ar hugain
Is that Gogese
I was always taught Dau deg un, though admittedly I'm not a Welsh speaker merely a learner
If I visited Portugal and didn't speak any Portuguese, would it be better for me to speak in English or Spanish

D'oh, of all the people I've since been told about, she seems like the biggest omission
Cheers, another one for my new list of people to check out
Yes, although her mother was English and her father Nigerian, Shirley was born in an area of Cardiff called "Tiger Bay", near the city's port and docklands
It's now been redeveloped and gentrified as "Cardiff Bay", and you'll find a lot of restaurants, our Parliament, and a theatre there
They're on my new list of bands to check out, anyway
Obligatory reminder that *Your Mother's got a penis* :P
Nope, mistake on my part leaving him out
That sounds right up my street, I've heard of them but that's about it
Thanks for the recommendation
Yeah, looks like I've got some new music to check out, anyway
It seems like Duffy had a good album and then just vanished from the music scene, I wonder what happened to her
No, but Jones is a fairly common Welsh surname
Great song
Early Manics albums seem a bit raw now, but *Everything Must Go* is one of my favourite 90s albums
Cheers, I'll check them out
Yeah I've heard of Catfish
Got a few new bands to check out after this comment, then
Good call
Now that's a cool fact
Not one I knew so thanks for that
Another good choice, but *Generation Terrorists* just beats it for me
Super Ted
Need to learn how to cross the road safely
Then Super Ted and Spotty will help
I remember watching it soo much in school
I'd also add SuperTed and Ivor the Engine for Wales
Yes, first broadcast on S4C in Welsh, under the title *Sam Tân*

Flashes of brilliance in a young team, but we lost to the Belgians, and beat Mexico in a friendly

I feel we're losing the "Together Stronger" we had since 2016
Giggs is currently absent due to an assault charge, 3 players have been sent home due to COVID breaches
So who knows
Tricky group really
I'd take second round
Yeah, IIRC we've lost some players from the 2016 squad too
Retirement, that sort of thing
Every language sounds beautiful until you learn to speak it
When I first read your comment I thought it was strange, I thought, doesn’t everyone know Irish exists
But then I remembered I’m a linguist so who knows how much thought the average population gives to old languages
Apparently there are still some islands off the coast where Welsh is a dominant language, at least moreso than English (or so I’ve heard)
Tito was alright wasn't he
Are you not aware how much Thatcher is hated over here
The vast majority of people who piss on her grave are from NEngland
As for Cromwell, dear God do you honestly think the man who stuck us under a Military dictatorship is popular with anyone except a few nutcases
Yeah Cromwell ain't popular in Britain
Man stuck us under a military dictatorship, banned everything, killed a king and burned down a bunch if villages over on your side of the sea
Literally only supported by Radical Republicans who want to knock off liz
Literally never heard of this guy
I guess he should have realised the country would fall apart without him, and should have tried to transition to more autonomous democracies when he knew he was not long for this world
You do realise he tried to install an absolutist Catholic monarchy
That is pretty far right
No we reached the nadir of the welsh language a few centuries ago
It'll never reestablish itself as the primary language, but that experience means it will never be allowed to die out
Didn't happen to us, and we've been doing this a long time
First language in a lot of areas
but the populous parts of Wales are a weird mix of 100% Welsh place names, first language English speakers who speak English with Welsh grammar/syntax and random Welsh words, and everything in-between
Welsh was killed by English imperialism but is having a revival via education in schools, the emergence of television and radio stations in Welsh etc, now more young people speak it than their grandparents who were beaten for speaking it and forgot it
For historical reasons, Northern Wales has a stronger Welsh speaking community
They also speak a slightly different dialect than in the south
The 2011 Census showed there was more of an [East / West split] in the distribution of Welsh speakers
The question is quite vague as it asks people if they can speak, read or write Welsh and assumes those abilities are all rather separate, IIRC
I’m not sure it’s quite the same but I hadn’t really heard about [Basque Whalers] until recently
They were so successful in the old and the new world
There was a Basque-Icelandic pidgin language, and a Basque-Algonquin pidgin language, due to the sheer number or Basque whalers operating and living in now modern Canada and Iceland
Such a unique interaction between people that you just don’t hear about (unless I’m just ignorant)
A ship of Basque sailors, travelling to the new world, meeting Native American tribes, establishing trading posts, creating a language
To me that’s as interesting as any ninja or viking story
These pidgin languages include parts of Spanish, French, German, English, Dutch and more
In my head the Basque people never had opportunity to have such international influence, yet they had established trading routes and posts in Ireland, Iceland and the colonial new world, all from northern Iberia
It really just caught me off guard
Now, or hopefully in like 20 years where I can stop hearing about Brexit and hopefully Wales is an independent or at least equal nation in the U.K. Anytime in the past was undoubtedly worse for Wales, strikes and the shutting down of industry in the 70s and 80s. Aberfan and Tryweryn before that
WWII and WWI, strikes in the 1920s. Before that dangerous industry and disease
Seems silly to go back to any of these times
Go back even further and you'd be speaking celtic
Proto-Celtic
I applied a very scientific method of saying them in an Italian, then Finnish accent and seeing which one sounded better
I have too many Finlands in there, but can't work out what to change

The only branch in Wales is in Cardiff
Warrington and Manchester are the closest branches if you're in North Wales
I went to the Currywurst museum in Berlin
Rollmops are good stuff though
So many, my reddit namesake [Yma O Hyd (Still Here)] and [Calon Lân (Pure Heart)] (which is translated as clean heart there but I think pure is better) are two brilliant songs, that only sound better when sung by crowds of people
I do like the anthem though, and don’t see a reason for it to change
Yma O Hyd was my shout too, great song for sure
Don't forget 'Bread of Heaven'
Brilliant song, sang it at my Grandads funeral and was amazing
I don’t know how well it represents Wales though, I feel like we aren’t as religious as in the past, so I left it out because it didn’t feel so emblematic of Wales
Not very well known
Welsh Rabbit (or Rarebit ) is one of our national delicacies
Unfortunately it's not rabbit but rather cheese on toast .
Around 1 in 3 people speak Welsh in Wales, and there are many thousands spread elsewhere in the U.K. People don’t realise how many people speak it since if you only speak English you don’t realise who in the town your in can speak Welsh since they won’t use it with you
I believe there’s not a single area of Wales with less than 10% Welsh speakers
Every child learns some at school but only those who attend Welsh language schools come away with any significant fluency
The goal of the Welsh govt is to have 1 million 1st language speakers by 2050
First language is around 600,000 but total speakers (including second language) worldwide is somewhere between 800,000 and 1 million
There are pockets of Welsh speakers which are getting bigger and bigger as the government pushes for more recognition of the Welsh language
It used to be that the Welsh language schools were worse than the English ones, but in recent times that has changed and now its desirable to send your children to Welsh language schools
I believe it’s just Argentina, [Y Wladfa] is the name for the areas where it’s still spoken
There’s a lot of Welsh heritage in America too
Many US presidents had Welsh heritage and Lincoln even had [100,000] election pamphlets printed in Welsh
In the cities (mostly Cardiff)
Indian - outstanding
Chinese/ Italian/ Vietnamese/ Thai - okay
Most others - meh if you can even find it
At a glance, I wouldn't call it realistic
They leave their guard open way too much, the number one unrealistic error I see in films
In other words, their swords are not being held in a way that actually defends them
But I've definitely seen worse, and there are aspects of this fight that are done really well
One nice touch is that the victor appears to be a much better swordsman than the defeated

My thoughts over the last 2 months:
"Giggs has got to go"
"There's no way we're qualifying"
"Holy **** we might actually do it"
"WE MADE IT
GIGGS IS THE BEST MANAGER EVER"
"...at least we qualified
"We're going to get battered in the group stage"
"Wait we might actually make it out of this group"
Additionally our FA on Twitter posted "Baku
Baku
Rome
In that order
Tough
Think we'll lose to Italy but we have a chance against Turkey and Switzerland
Not keen on playing in Baku though
I'm pretty chuffed with the draw considering we got Turkey and Switzerland instead of Germany and Portugal
Very true but with the confusing rules this year we could have only been in the group we got or in Denmark and Russia's group
Playing Turkey in Baku will be tough but at least we have two games in Baku in a row rather than having to travel from Baku to Rome and back to Baku again
Still Switzerland, Turkey, Italy in that order, could have been much worse ;)
In Welsh we went true Galaxy Brain and call it
# a
Yes
I feel like Wales has done nothing but suffer as part of this shit show
Yes
Wales doesn't get a good deal out of the UK, it has kept us poor for centuries
People here are starting to realise this and there is growing support for independence (especially since the Brexit vote)
At this point I think its 50/50 whether it'll happen in my lifetime
I don't know what the fuck is going on
Ok know Wales voted leave but we have a non-insignificant percentage of our population is English retirees
Wales couldn't survive on its own though and parliament shits on us already
I just hope Scotland gets out
I’ve seen a few English people say they want to ditch the other nations due to the (pretty wrong) reports recently that Scotland produces more than 50% of the UK’s deficit
It’s of the idea that the other nations are a drain on England’s economy
If this was true then there would never have been English complaints about the other nations nationalists
I think the brexit process has shown to a lot of Welsh people that Westminster don’t give a shit about us and also the only reason for leaving isn’t brexit, it’s just pushed more people onto the Indy side
The reason Wales voted to leave is because we have almost no independent media - for example when England had the junior doctor crisis everyone in Wales thought it was happening here too, not true different system
Also, there’s a considerable number of English retirees who come from a typical brexit sort of background, which doesn’t mean to say they shouldn’t have an opinion
I saw a YouGov poll this morning about opinions on the prorogue and the region Wales’ stats were considered in was Midlands and Wales
Wales is continuously pegged as a region of England in stats and figures and if not independence more devolution and consideration needs to be applied
The major reason Wales is screwed is because of the Union, not because it’s naturally in a bad state
Westminster has given us the most basic since the 1970s and 80s when heavy industry went into decline
It would weaken every nation initially no doubt
But the figures saying Scotland produces >50% of the UK’s deficit means nothing as they have no borrowing powers to begin with, same with Wales (which incidentally also says Wales produces >50% which again doesn’t make sense)
Wales produces more than twice the electricity it produces and way more water than it uses
There’s plenty of opportunity for it to stand and there’s many countries that started in the same position and are better off today
As a welshman, the welsh economy is broken, we only don’t want independence because we know that we have had no investment for so long that we couldn’t even survive on our own
like we can barely survive in the union, forget alone
Over pushed the idea that we are dependant nations to the point where they accidentally proved that they might be lying/manipulating figures to make it seem that way
I think there needs to be serious study into independence and the results so that the potential results are all mapped out before we can say exactly which situation is best really, rather than there being no definitive numbers and facts to speak about
I think one of the independence movements selling points is that it will be a leaving process of many years where powers and rules are changed one by one not all of a sudden at the end of a set time period
I'm the opposite, until I met more people in Uni, everyone I knew drank tea with only a couple also drinking coffee
In Slovenia or Wales
I've never heard that in Wales, but then, not many people in a Welsh kebab shop are sober enough to respond to questions anyway
Cardiff - the coal trade
Cardiff grew to be the largest settlement in Wales due to the coal trade, and I believe at one point was one of the biggest coal exporting ports in the world
Coal dominated South Wales throughout the late 19th and 20th Centuries and we still haven't recovered from the industry's collapse in the 1980s
We were able to defeat a small number of Napoleon’s force stationed here
The men thought that the women dressed in traditional garments were British forces and just surrendered to them
A few proposals have been made, but the issue then is people say it either [gives Wales too much prominence] within the Union Jack, or [changes it too much]
Personally, I say skip the Dragon and incorporate the [Flag of St David] instead
[I hope you're wearing sunglasses] No, really
It was aired first time in the UK last year funnily enough
> Solution: officially announce that you have changed the flag to be the first one, except for leaving the dragons background red instead of changing it white
LOL
>Is it just me or does the last one look more like a combination of the flags of Germany and France than anything else

A no deal exit is off the table and must not happen at any cost
The EU members know this
This is all a game right now
The EU has no incentive to give the UK a better deal now because they know the UK would rather have a second referendum that a hard exit
We may get delays/extensions, attempted work arounds, leadership revolt and even a general election to get there but the chances of a second referendum are growing
I think you underestimate younger voters tbh
Nobody I know voted as we assumed we would remain, were to distracted with our own bs and/or simply didn't know what was going on (Most of us watch little tv and spend more time on social media were political advertisements aren't presented to us)

Most the EU isnt European atall, the average citizen in Europe knows nothing about what goes on in Brussels, they are more nationalistic than ever on top of that
And lets face it, half the countries are still fairly poor by western standards, and the other half are in some form of crisis or meltdown, of the wealthier nations you have the likes of Greece, Italy and Spain who havent really seen any growth or positivity in YEARS and face massive unemploment all over the place with lots more negatives to come, so why the fuck would those 3 be playing games

Interestingly, the Soviets actually had absurdly detailed military maps of most potential adversaries - you can find their maps of New York and the like and they’re accurate not just to the road but to the building - they were better than many country’s own maps
So they definitely had the data to fill this in, presumably they excluded it in their domestic maps for political reasons
I love democracy
Yep
Though that was more commonly by changing the angles and distances involved - distortion rather than complete expunging
Idea was that a civilian (or indeed anyone) could still use a map to map out a route to a location but, for example, an artillery commander in an invading force wouldn’t be able to use them to work out the exact distance and bearing from the village he was in to the next one over
Or a sniper or mortarman wouldn’t be able to work out the exact distance from their position to the strongpoint 3 streets over
Agreed - I can't imagine how someone would believe they'd crossed into the West while still being in the East
Probably a grain of truth to it in that East German (and indeed Eastern block in general) maps often were distorted
Not to prevent civilian travel (they'd still enable you to map out a route) but selected distances and dimensions and angles would be distorted so as to render the maps useless for more military applications (artillery rangefinding, aerial bombing, sniping, etc)
Absolutely
I mean, the Berlin metros remained connected between West and East at a couple of key points, at least for a while
My grandfather was an intelligence officer in the West for a bit and used to have to occasionally retrieve enlisted who'd accidentally stayed on the metro too long (the East German police would pick them up and make a big song and dance about them being attempted spy incursions)

Scotland nooo take Wales with you
At the moment there’s more than enough conservative support here to keep plaid well out judging by the election results
And everyone else for that matter
The problem is that the rural communities, and farmers like conservative values and see liberalism as a threat to their way of life
Equally a lot of people out in the real rural areas have “comfortable money” and believe the message that conservatives will help them maintain that lifestyle
At the same time, poorer areas like Newport and Ebbw Vale in the south feel neglected and overlooked
It didn’t help that a large amount of refugees were settled in Newport which is already a deprived area
And so people viewed what little they had as being taken away and given to the refugees whilst the conservative government held up their hands and said “hey it’s not our fault, the EU made us do it”.
There is widespread resentment here that the social welfare of some of the poorest areas in the UK is being given to foreigners and taken away from deprived communities to do it
And that the foreigners threaten conservative rural lifestyles
You can call it racism
And in many cases it is
But if you look deeper it’s fear and anger that they’ve been neglected for so long
This really was a people’s vote on the issue of brexit
The problem was that they believed all the misinformation and finger pointing bullshit that went along with it
South Wales also has little to know interest in welsh language with the vast majority not identifying with Plaids Welsh national identity
It sucks, it really does, and it’ll be frustrating to see how far people will let themselves be pushed before they realise they’ve been fooled, again
What’s even more frustrating is that those people who are voting conservative here are doing so and truly believe they’ve made the right choice and they’ve helped protect the NHS
And I truly believe rather than admitting they were wrong when it comes to it, people will stick to their decision to the end because they can’t bare the thought of admitting they got tricked or believed the media
Damn, hate to see Wales still stuck on here

Although I would never criticise any Russian for not protesting, since doing so is incredibly dangerous, I would love to see thousands upon thousands protesting and finally tell this dictatorship to fuck off
Nah bro there must be some mistake, we're 'taking it seriously' over here, there is simply no way we could end up like the Americans
Your cumulative cases are jumping by 1,000 per 1m per day
That's an impressive achievement
We've seen that sudden vertical leap here in the UK, and more pronounced in France, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium and Czech Republic
I'll be interested to see what happens in Germany as you've got a test and trace system that's about as good as you're going to practically get in a western European country
I hope it works out but I suspect you might just be a few weeks behind
Edit: Out of interest, do you get the same shit tier takes in Germany wondering why you can't replicate New Zealand/South Korea as we do in the UK
Why would you say that
Would have had the same impact if he stayed at home and drawn on the map in Paint
Being busy can feel like you're doing something
Of course
That's why people are doing 4/20 memes
I'd completely forgotten that the Americans did that
I feel like I'mma be a party pooper here and say this is pretty much the size I expected it to be
Even on distorted maps you can see Japan extends long and thin- How big/ small do people think Japan is

Thanks - I recognised the Norwegian plane but the SAS one was the one I was curious about
The angle didn't really help me identify it
Thanks for the info, that's quite an impressive project
Ah, thanks
The front view wasn't too clear
That's even more impressive

don’t worry all of wales is bap too
There were already two or three ferry companies operating ferries directly from Ireland to France, and to multiple ports in the two countries too
There is nothing new here, just a new ferry company
This feels like sitting on the naughty step watching the other kids have fun :(
Sadly nobody who actually supports Brexit in Britain actually cares about any of the facts, or think that they won’t be affected by the inevitable downsides of Brexit
I’ve noticed a huge increase in this kind of stuff on European news
Out of interest, is European media really going at the UK at the moment over brexit
I’d thought you’d all got bored of talking about it like we had
The sad truth is that most of the middle class hate this and don’t want to leave at all
Most of the poorer working class or those on welfare simply don’t understand or at worst don’t care
And really only the wealthy upper class and stubborn opinionated oldies are full on pro-brexit
Is Europe really losing that much with us
It’s Britain’s loss and Europe’s gain
The UK is Europe's USA

Odd pattern there, they trust their former victims the French yet do not trust the nations that beat em in ww2
There is weird coincidence in that

Great Britain isn’t that insulting, if you put “England” instead that would’ve been very insulting to welsh people
But also funny
You’ve pissed off Welsh nationalists but made Welsh unionists piss their pants in excitement
I immediately had this same thought
Great stuff, we'll pick the other 26 up in the morning

Can't believe no one has mentioned his flat back tyre yet
Status, maybe
As a remain voter it drains me to think I’ll have to deal with this shit for the rest of my life
I’m welsh but im gutted for myself
Stupid Brexit
What did the Welsh ever do to you
Exactly, the EU as a "unit" is great for countries like Belgium, Lithuania, Estonia who can unite to be a force similar to the UK/France etc, oversimplifying it to be "UK, FRANCE, GERMANY" irrelevant
which is obviously not true
Why is this
I have no strong feelings one way or the other
GM is not banned in the EU, specific strains are banned
Primarily because the EU could not demonstrate the proposed benefits
The moment a GM crop that has reproducible and measurable benefits exists it will be allowed

So I can post it on r/AgedLikeMilk if you’re wrong (despite really hoping you won’t be)
I saw the ad campaign for that questionnaire they sent round earlier this year
Disgusting
Tried looking for the UK and then it hit me :(
I miss being on these cool stat maps
Wales is tabling potential independence for the first time in its history at the senedd so hopefully in my life time we can be part of the state again
It's too early to say, I expect this first mention in the senedd to be shot down but I feel that as the ramifications of Brexit continue it'll only grow in support
Especially if NI or Scotland leave first
*Dam* that's impressive
I'm assuming the UK inherits Spain's 3100km of high-speed rail
In which case I'm reasonably OK with that :P
I guess so
Good point - I guess I wanted the trains more :P
Does anyone know who/how these borders are drawn
I'm from one of the red areas in Wales, and it appears as though the border has been drawn to separate off the wealthy M4 corridor (the blue sliver to the south) and the poorer valleys into two separate regions, even though for lots of other purposes 'South Wales' is taken as a whole
I'm just wondering if Wales might have been divided in this way deliberately to create a 'less developed region' to secure additional funding or something
Fancy Wales and Cornwall voting for Brexit, both net beneficiaries
What does it take to be a more developed because Wales is actually developed I'd say
I'm Welsh and this hurts
Wel ffyc
This was clearly made by an English man
around 21% of uks export income comes from South Wales
same, sheffield in the uk is fairly nice compared to my home town but my home town is in blue and sheffield is in yellow
The EU benefits that Wales has seen in places like Merthyr is crazy
The fact that a majority of Wales voted for Brexit is utterly absurd
West Wales isn't all bad
All those new roads
“What has the EU ever done for us

Happy to see my hometown of Carmarthen on there, was technically called Maradunium at the time though

Genuinely funny joke, I don't think you'll get much applause for it today though
It isn't inefficient though
It provides a service for 400m+ and manages to do it much cheaper per head than any of the individual nations within could do so
Ya know this is possibly the most sensible thing I've read on this post tbh
Yeah it's been fun winding up these nationalists but ya right, nationalism kills
That's a bit rich coming from a turk, you guys are the last people who should be talking about exterminating a people
About as petty as yours tbh
Let's be fair, it's not as if your argument required a full and consistent take down bud
And
Do you really expect anyone to take claims you make seriously when you still deny the Armenian genocide
Come on pal, surely you would know that this is not a hill you are going to win and battles on
Well the point here is that if ya gonna make claims about atrocities, ya gotta keep your own house in order first
Its not as if Turkey has ever claimed responsibility for the Armenian genocide, so why should anyone take your claims seriously
That's my point
So quid pro quo
Admit you did wrong to the Armenians and then we might talk about your grievances
Not really
More like outright hypocrisy on your part
You can't engage in claims of victimhood if you yourself have been known to get up to some horrific shit
So own up or shut up
Those are your only two options here

Is there any countrys that dony say it's legal but dont say its ilegal
Not great
It was seen as a counter cultural movement and thus anti-soviet and repressed
There are at least a few missing, there’s a major roman road near where I live that isn’t on this map
Shocked and quite surprised to read people's anecdotes in this thread
Perhaps ignorantly, I've always rebuffed the traditionally ignorant UK narrative on all things Romania: I've lived with great Romanian flatmates and generally only experienced good things from the country and its people, without ever having been lucky enough to visit
In my mind, Romania didn't suffer problems on this scale any more

North Wales too has more than one line as well, there is a line that runs down the Conwy Valley towards Betws-Y-Coed
UK here, lived in Newport, Sheffield and Manchester
This isn’t because we all have houses, we all live in tiny houses compared to everyone else or rows or terraced houses
The government here tended to house the poor in freshly built “council estates” and “council towers”, at least that’s the case in Wales, and so apartments are associated generally with being poor (not so much in london but london is so different from the rest of the country it’s not worth entertaining)
Due to the bad association and the general shoddiness of anything built within the last 60 years here, we tend to go for older, preferably victorian or earlier, terraced, semi detached or detached housing, and tend to avoid more dense forms of housing
Of course we pay for this in tiny houses and gentrification
ideally, your free space would be the city
Our cities just aren’t nice enough to trust your kids in them sadly

What about a place called "Mold" in North Wales
Surprised Splott didn’t make it onto there
I remember in school a teacher telling us Mumbles was named because the two hills looked like breasts and in an old British language the word for mammals sounds like Mumbles
Hey mumbles isn't odd
r/llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
What's odd about Maidenhead
On top of the few pointings out, there are actually only 10 letters there because ‘Ll’ counts as an individual letter in the Welsh alphabet
There is more vowels in the Welsh language than the English language
Indeed, Welsh is a beautiful language that rolls off the tongue really nicely of you know how to pronounce things, otherwise you’re going to have a bad time
Where's the aisle of random crap in the middle of the store
They always seem to be moving the stock round at random times in my local Aldi
Usually when the place is most full
Do you guys have Lidl too
It's like two similar but not quite the same stores
And yes, Lidl have a similar random product aisle in the middle of the store
Yeah, Aldi are smartening their UK stores up too
Fancy new refrigerators for the meat, things like that
They have really taken over the middle of the supermarket 'market' here, the likes of Asda are struggling to keep up and the previous king of low cost, Iceland, has had to seriously up their game to compete
This makes me sad
I live in Wales I’m so fucked
Destroying statues is literally just washing away history, both good and bad
If they actually cared about the meaning behind statues include plaques saying the context behind the individual don't destroy culture and history completely

Thank goodness for that
You do realise that he's on the run right
Pretending he doesn't exist doesn't mean the attack didn't happen
Which it will
However he was on the run so releasing his photo and sharing it is vitally important
Read the fucking news before making your tired cliche comments
It is cliche, everyone says the same crap over and over "don't share pictures, names, motives" yeah we get it, you don't want the attacker to have notoriety but sadly the world will never work like that
It's important we know who these people are and why they did it
Sticking your fingers in your ears because you simply don't want to know the issues or reasons for these attacks does not do anyone any help

Wales doesn't even have a sentence for it, and to be fair that's probably about right for this

Then you could drain the North sea and then reclaim doggerland
Even before Schengen most of the borders in Europe were pretty much open

The rest were a wave through or even no border guards in place
God I love Ed Miliband
No I wouldn't jump on it in a heartbeat, because it would obviously be a tax-avoidance loophole
Don't assume that because you're ok with fucking over your fellow citizens for personal gain everyone else is
> Would you pay more money in tax than you need to
That's a leading question
It implies that every method of tax avoidance should be pursued simply because your government hasn't explicitly closed that loophole yet
I pay the taxes I owe and take advantage of any legal deductions that are offered to me
What I do **not** do is actively search out loopholes to avoid paying as much
Giovanni Strazza probably couldn't either without practice
To do things like this you need to practice for decades
People vastly overstate the importance of natural talent
Natural talent will help you learn a skill faster and could potentially give you that extra 1% that pushes you from "artist" to "master".
But the first 99% is practice
If Giovanni Strazza had worked in a field for 20 years and then one day tried to make a sculpture it would look just as terrible as any of our attempts
24 C is too hot for me, good luck muchachos

Without the E.U I'd be poorer sure, I'd loose my freedom of movement, digital privacy rights, comprehensive human rights and the ability to enjoy my beloved German beer

**Unhappy sleep deprived remainer noises**
For me, homosexuality has only existed as a label in recent human history
If you look back into ancient history, there was much more fluidity within relationships, so what we would now consider to be gay men and women would quite happily have children via the standardised methods if they were feeling broody, but still have their lovers of the same sex
I'm not sure when society fell into this mindset of "Oh, if you're gay then you cannot do x, y and z, because only straight people can do that," as it seems at odds with the desire for producing progeny, which is generally universal to differing degrees
Perhaps the key to true equality is to drop all these labels and just be who you want to be
Czechia played a central role in the Thirty Years War
Remember some parts of the HRE lost 50% of their population to a spat over religion
It is how it was in the UK
Their children will say no religion and half of cultural Christians end up saying no religion as well
Cultural Christianity has always been a transition state to a non-religious norm
Yeah using concerns about Islam as a trojan horse for naked racism is heavily watched for because it is very common

Sorry guys, seeing this picture reminded me of a skit on a old british comedy show called the fast show
Which one
You can win the campaign if you end on favourable terms
For example the Malayan emergency resulted in independence, but the communists weren’t the ones to take power, instead it was a peaceful transfer to a government favourable to Britain
Same thing with Irish independence, transfer of power was relatively favourable to the UK, with parts of the island that wanted to stay remaining with the UK, along with the free state remaining firmly under UK influence
Everyone was happy, right
The free state has a lot of freedom to this day, but it is still cooperates closely with the UK, I personally feel that Irish independence was inevitable after the way it was treated under UK rule, might as well have the government of the country be amenable to UK foreign policy
I am being sarcastic and was referring to the troubles, I imagine if the UK had ‘won’ and refused Irish independence that there would only have been a longer, bloodier troubles
A ‘megatroubles’ if you will
Now you’re being pedantic, we both know I’m speaking of the republic, a state which happens to be free
> Would you be saying that if the UK had won the war of independence
I probably would be saying that, a long winded counterinsurgency would not be worthwhile for the UK
Besides, the Empire quelled many rebellions in its foreign territories that it later ceded peacefully later on, just look at the entire decolonisation process, the UK could’ve kept the empire had it used force only, but diplomatic pressure from abroad meant that the independence movements could succeed peacefully
I believe Ireland would’ve been able to get independence eventually, just like how Scotland most likely will get it soon
That's Marine A's wife
'Marine A' is Alexander Blackman, a former Royal Marine who had been found guilty (in 2013) of murdering an injured Taliban fighter (in 2011)
The Taliban fighter had been injured by an Apache Helicopter
When Blackman's patrol came across the fighter, Blackman ordered the injured fighter to be moved out of sight of a British surveillance balloon
Blackman shot the injured fighter in the chest, saying "shuffle off this mortal coil you cunt
It's nothing you wouldn't do to us". He then told the other members of the patrol not to mention the incident, saying "I just broke the Geneva Convention".
On 15/3/17 a military court reduced the conviction from murder to manslaughter, on the basis of diminshed reponsibility because Blackman had been suffering from [adjustment disorder] On 28/3/17, a civilian court reduced his sentence to 7 years, and due to time already served, he will be released "within weeks". The judge said that although Blackman did have diminshed responsibilty due to his mental illnes, he still bore a great deal of responsibility
Blackman has expressed regret for his actions, and the lightness of the sentence is a reflection of an otherwise immaculate record
The Uk contributed a lot to the EU though, you can hardly call a net contributor dead weight

I grew up in Cumbria
I'm surprised our county isn't in red
I worked alongside social workers who had CSE prevention on their brief
Basically, it was a hot potato and would get thrown backwards and forwards between YOT teams and duty teams
I helped put together a 'neutral' team to whom reports would get sent so they could allocate them to specific support workers in tandem with police liaison officers
Led to huge successes in smashing a lot of gangs targeting young girls
Then they disbanded the team because of budget pressures and we were all forced out
I & people on my team suffered mental health problems because of the stuff we saw & there was no support from the authority
We tried taking action against them but the union & their legal partners strung it out so long and then said they couldn't do anything & councillors played deaf, dumb & blind
Last I checked, CSE rates were back up to historic norms in the area and the hierarchy are like
"Whyyyyy
" Meanwhile, those of us who did something about it have been broken
I work for minimum wage in a factory now; my confidence is just gone
Wall of text yes, but it gives you an idea of why the problem persists; when people do succeed in doing something about these problems, there's always seems to be an institutional/hierarchical  response that fucks that system up
I'm not given to conspiracy theories,, although given that one of the senior managers heavily involved in the downfall of our project was subsequently found guilty of accessing sensitive case information on our system to support her paedophile husband who was jailed long term around the same time for abusing children while he was a social worker
well, draw your own conclusions
I could write a book about this stuff
There was a massive child abuse scandal involving some children's homes in North Wales
It was in the 80s and 90s though, so it's mostly under Reddit's radar

The primary anger against the EU is basically people blaming Brussels for Tory policy
So Cameron would have to stand in front of the camera and say "Brussels aren't screwing you
We are screwing you and a damned fine job of it we are doing too" to defend the EU
I wouldn't say the EU is neo-liberal
To be neo-liberal you basically need to be in favour of ever decreasing market regulation
The EU is much closer to German ordoliberalism
It used to be pulled between German ordoliberalism and French dirigisme
The entry of neo-liberal UK pulled the balance more towards the German position (arguably ordoliberalism is the centre point between dirigisme and neo-liberalism)

Hey don't worry man, I as a Brit get it
Having seen and experienced first hand how easy it is to get a hate mob going I really do get it
There was a lot of bullshit said during that referendum campaign and since the vote things have been said in anger from the E.U side and the UK brexitier  side that have polarised things even more
I hope that things get averted tonight
I hope Boris Johnson gets booted outta office, article 50 gets withdrawn and some goddamn GROWN UPS get to hold the reigns of power in the UK but I know that's still a far off possibly
I just hope in 15 years time when Britain finally sees sense you'll forgive the idiots here in the UK and we may continue where we left off back before we in the UK decided to succumb to this delusional dream that the gammon brexitiers hold
I think Brexit is an idiotic idea and I don’t want to go

I’ve been watching a lot about early civilisations lately and they are all truly fascinating
It amazes me how human society and governance almost immediately became as complex as it is today from the very moment we started building the first cities

Wales was the first part of the UK to introduce [charges for single-use carrier bags] (2011), and [presumed consent for organ donation] (2015)
Wales introduced a ban on smacking children, so parents can't claim reasonable punishment as a defence for common battery of their children
I think we're behind Scotland on that one though
Did you guys do that thing where people who get a car or motorbike licence are asked if they want to donate their organs
Agreed
I've never given blood (can't because I got a transfusion in the 80s, something to do with BSE
), but that sort of thing is also a good idea
I think you also get asked when you get your driving licence
Nice one
Wow, that's gotta be one of the earliest nations in Europe, surely
Good point
I'm not sure if UK licences do that yet
Don't have a licence myself (my eyesight ruled it out until recently), but I think it's a fairly recent thing, yeah
Wow, that is impressive

Actually, I was going to comment pretty much what you said
In Wales more people are starting to question the benefits of independence, and admittedly there's a mountain to climb but Johnson could get that ball rolling
Ultimately I agree with Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price when he said that the Tories elected a clown
I'm just praying Scotland buys us when they leave the UK
I know Wales voted leave but in our defence a sizeable population are English retirees
Same as you OP - praying it ignites a pro-indy movement here
Whilst also shitting myself, a little
[Unseen footage of Johnson's acceptance speech]
Bittersweet
He is an absolute disaster but I think now at least Scottish independence is inevitable (and hopefully we won't be too far behind)
Rather terrified to be frank
I'd imagine this is gonna be a reimagination of Trump except in the UK
He also looks the part so there's that
> At least in Greece there are signs pointing out that X project was funded in part by the EU
Nothing of the sort in the UK as far as I recall, there's a huge lack of education regarding that
[Signs like that] were *everywhere* [here in Wales] Despite the EU funding large parts of our infrastructure, 52
5% of people who voted to Leave looked at that and said "[nah, we don't need that]
In my mind, yes
In reality
no comment
Nah she's an authoritarian hag
Cough Rory cough
One of my favourite historical anecdotes is the unintional Scottish use of biological warfare in the 1745 jacobite uprising
They brought cows with them from scotland who it's heavily suspected were infected with some disease or other I can't remember
The scottish army penetrated as far south as roughly derby, and strangely the cow populations along this trail came down with the disease as well with the disease spreading as low as derby
Definetly sounded better when I read it than this sounded but hey ho
Not necessarily unemployed, could be a minimum wage worker
Reliance on food banks to feed their kids, skipping meals to save money, avoiding using the heating/electric, no internet, renting (potentially council housing)
According to a study in 2015, 21
6% of people here are in relative poverty
This is poverty where you have a low income relative to others
I’m not quite sure how this is calculated, as surely people would always be in relative poverty, unless there’s a qualifier of 20% less than median or something
There must be a qualifier of sorts because it goes on to talk about how people can’t afford to feed their kids and eat, afford products like shampoo and food etc
There’s a figure going around than almost 1 in 5 children here suffer from food insecurity
Which is when healthy nutritious food for each day is not guaranteed
This poverty, both abject and relative, has huge knock on effects
Someone in relative poverty will end up socially excluded, which mean they will be up to 10 times more likely to die early
These children are also growing up, not knowing when they’ll next eat a hot meal, not having any (or many) toys, missing out on sports, clubs and even school
For sure, since I finished school I haven't had many chances to speak my native language
Long periods of time of speaking nothing but english has left my Welsh vocabulary noticeably lacking compared to a few years ago
Don't really count since english is my first language, but I love it when people have strong accents over english
I especially like dutch accents, but tbh any accent is a lot more personal than learning to speak with a perfect accent
My accent is a bit odd, nobody ever guesses correctly (I've had everything from West Country to Norfolk), the only place nobody ever guesses is Wales
I wish I had a bit of a Welsh Valleys accent and didn't sound as English as I do
I don't really know what my accent actually is, it sounds English but isn't posh, its got a subtle Welsh twang but not enough that it sounds Welsh
IDEK
This has been one of the few Reddit threads I've seen which has genuinely blown my mind
I had no idea Europeans were so self conscious about their accents
As Brit who only speaks English (as is tradition) I don't think I've ever thought anything negative about the accent of anyone speaking English
I think my accent is ok
It could be better but it could also be worse, I think it's rather neutral
Regarding others' accents, I don't mind many foreign accents
The American accent can annoy me sometimes (personally I find it really unnatural, it sounds made up)
I don't like a lot of the British accents, they're just too thick and difficult to understand
Its also a problem for a UK person learning Spanish (me) the LL and J is easy because I grew up in Wales and that has similar sounds, buit rolling R's lol I could live for 300 years and still not do it (god I have tried)
'fierce dull' - what a great expression
I know it's probably not representative of most Germans, but I can listen to Sebastian Vettel speaking English all day
I was told my Rs in Spanish are quite good
I think it’s probably from learning a Welsh from a young age which has a lot of rolled Rs
Frustrated my friend who studies a Spanish degree though as she had to spend years getting it right
Android are just more realable and I phones are known for breaking
Wait so in canada I phones dint easily break
Have they fixed the accent yet
We're the guy that doesn't get involved in much of anything - sitting out of things like gift exchanges and office drama
We have a very niche job, and do it well, but we don't really get involved with other people
It's also probably our job to fix the water cooler whenever it's broken
Macsen and Geraint come from Maximillian and Gerontius from back when we had those Romans over
I believe that Idris and Cerys date back even further to Phoenician traders
Lots of Welsh names seem pretty timeless but I've never met a young Blodwen
As someone who speaks quite decent German, if I'm speaking German but theres an English word mid-sentence I almost always mispronounce the English word
Wales has more castles per square mile than any other country on Earth
Wales has 4x more sheep than people, the second largest sheep: person ratio in the world after New Zealand
The longest place name in Europe (and second longest in the World) is Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, which is on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales
The Welsh national anthem was the first national anthem to ever be sung before an international sporting fixture, when the Welsh rugby team sang it in response to New Zealand's haka in 1905
The patron saint of Ireland, St
Patrick, was actually Welsh and was taken to Ireland as a slave
I've met Finnish people in the UK and can vouch for 2
> The longest place name in Europe (and second longest in the World) is Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, which is on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales
It's also the longest [railway station name] in Europe, IIRC
Ironically the [station has had to be closed] as the platforms are too short for social distancing
Thanks for the contact lenses, with my prescription I really need them
I'm assuming the Welsh sheep stat is compared to countries rather than territories
Oddly the same is said here too
Way back in the early 00s this was a pretty big topic here in the uk
Nope
It's spread across the entirety of Europe and the West at this point, maybe even further
Have you seen today's example of "Leopards ate MY face

Ran
Not problem my is it
(I do mainly speaking Welsh “iaith llafar” so sorry to the other Cymry if my grammar’s off)
I've gotta be honest, probably not because Wales haven't been since the 1950's. I'd be happy if there were more joint efforts, and I'm still against the world cup being in Qatar
While not technically a politician, one of the chief science advisor to the government, a guy who was heavily responsible for imposing lockdown on us, resigned
For being caught breaking lockdown
To have an adulterous shag
* In 1993, the Secretary of State for Wales, John Redwood, was captured on cameras making a [right mess] of singing the Welsh national anthem
* Alun Cairns (a more recent holder of the Welsh Secretary's office), campaigned for the relatively pointless renaming of the Second Severn Crossing [in honour of Prince Charles] a man who is not exactly universally popular in Wales
* Alun Cairns later had to resign as Welsh Secretary after a former aide of his [caused the collapse of a rape trial]
* A few weeks ago, the Welsh Government's Health Minister was forced to apologise after being [caught swearing during a Zoom meeting]
Welsh assembly hasnt had anything like that
yet have they
Sheep cull
Urdd have called off the Youth Eisteddfod and closed their residential camps (Glan-llyn, Llangrannog etc)
I think that's a victory to the 'black nun' then
Yes, rarely a day goes by where there isn't a "save the children of * insert African nation * from dirty water" advert
I was told once by a former CEO of a charity that most of the help and donations that are given to African countries creates more problems than they purport to solve
For example, all the clothing that was donated during Live Aid and since have completely decimated the local textile and clothing industries due to the abundance of cheaper donated clothes
&#x200B;
I also remember around the early 90s having appeals (mostly in schools) to send aid packages to the former eastern block Balkan countries for the same purpose
As a native English speaker the words synecdoche and hyperbole were very strange to me
I suppose it’s because they aren’t spelt as they would be if they were originally from English, but I still remember them as hyper-bowl and se-neck-douche
The offensive word for Spanish people that I was told is “spik”. Though I’ve never really heard anyone use it, but would recommend avoiding it anyway
Hopefully it’s just dying out as a word because no one wants to use it

We did it in school for GCSE English, don’t think I ever used it really
Certainly isn’t common
I remember apropos because when I first heard it I thought someone was having fun abbreviating the word appropriate, so now when I’m trying to remember it that series of event comes to mind
Yeah, I just remember it wrongly in order to remember it correctly if that makes any sense
I've never received one in the mail, I've always picked one up whenever I visited any of their stores though
I can understand the sadness Swedes feel about this decision - us Brits had the same when [Argos announced they were discontinuing their catalogues] earlier this year
Yup, I did that too
[Here's the video
Sadly, yes
Sadly it's true - I think they're going to keep doing a mini Xmas catalogue like they've got this year, though
Yes and no
Amongst older generations, the baby boomers  yeah there probably is, the younger down the demographics you go though it tends to disappear though
Honestly though it depends what you mean by anti German sentiment
And I would say it's definitely less then you'd find amongst the English
Any time there is a England vs Germany football match boy does it ramp up
I don't think it is
The only people I can recall saying anything remotely anti-german are conspiracy theorists and nationalists who are obsessed with the war
I don't think most people care
Not all the elderly, some of them were on the side of the Nazi
That's true, I suppose,  if you on the eurosceptic side of things you ain't gonna love the germans
Plus especially in Englands case when it Co
Es to the football England fans ain't too fond of Germans either
Can I just say re: the UK , most of us , like 99
9% never even think about Serbia and could not find you on a map
Croatia on the other hand is lovely
I have heard that they (ze Germans) stare a lot and the women force the men to pee sitting down
As a free British person we are told from birth that "it's rude to stare" and nobody will force  me to pee sitting down
And people say Germans lack hunour
And the English are a bunch of Morris dancing cunts :)
We just like war because we never lose, it's nothing personal, go back to squatting and smoking cigarettes, it will relax you
I will put it on my reading list
Sounds hilarious
TBH if I was unlucky enough to be an eastern European I would be a bit salty about B Liar
So this is why the reputation for staring
So basically you pee like a girl
Maybe the British telling the world, through media , that Germans have no sense of humour, has caught on
Hmm we are taught in the UK that it's rude to stare, it's like inviting somebody to fight you
Is the men being made to pee sitting down a real thing as well
I always thought Spar was from America (specifically New England due to the tree and the colour scheme)
Should have called it after the equivalent offence: *Taken Without Owner's Consent*

There's nothing quite like it
It's called Penneys in Ireland, IIRC
Opel was bought by GM, not GE
They've now sold Opel (and Vauxhall) to PSA of France
It is German - IIRC it's a shortened form of "Albrect Discount", named after the founder
So does that weird you guys out if you come to the UK and see Primark
Like how it's TK Maxx here but TJ Maxx in the USA
I'm going to have to look for pictures of Penneys branches now, I imagine they are identical apart from the name
Scotland perhaps
It's perfectly safe to drink the tap water in Wales
The water here in North Wales is particularly good - to the point that rural villages were even bulldozed to enable the construction of new reservoirs to serve cities in Northwest England
I’m from North Wales and I agree, I guess if I was in London or something I’d buy bottled water tbh
>In absolutely every TV show in the UK that takes place in Spain (and there are many) they insist on playing flamenco sounding music even when the show is about Catalonia, Galicia or The Basque Country,
Tbh they do that with every country, even the ones that are part of the UK
If its set in North Wales you can guarantee everyone would have a (South Wales) valleys accent, there would be male voice choir singing (again largely part of South Welsh culture) and there would definitely be a shot of a sheep on a hillside
You mean bacalhau (I don’t know if I’m spelling that right) or just cod in general
Welsh lockdown rules only make the UK wide news when they're controversial
> I've noticed it's often misspelt as Whales
I suspect that's a consequence of autocorrect assuming they really do mean to type "Whales"
Someone in my school let off a stink bomb in the head teachers car (no idea how they managed it) but that was the only exciting thing that ever happened (apart from students shagging in the toilets but thats standard)
I'm not sure there's been an example of Welsh in a film or TV show at all, let alone a decent attempt
I love Bruhl, his English is literally perfect too
To be fair a lot of people hiking in wales are people that aren't welsh and haven't hiked before
Can you literally not just do that at home over a nice cup of tea though
I’ve never heard the phrase “to go Dutch” before
The English sometimes say " don't Welsh on a bet" meaning don't try and get out of paying a bet, but the correct term is "Welch"
So it's a bit like saying "don't make me your escape goat" or " you keep me hanging on tender hooks" basically stupid shit that stupid people say
Outside of YouTube videos I’ve only really encountered this in person once
I’m pretty comfortable with most Welsh accents (not shocking), my Dad is Irish so I’m used to him and his families accents
I’ve got a northern English flatmate and feel pretty comfortable with those accents
Scottish is on tv a lot and I’ve read Trainspotting so I recognise some of the unique words (ken, keks, bairn, greetin)
I spent a lot of time in the South West of England growing up, and yet in a pub in Bristol around a year ago, there was a old guy with the most incomprehensible Somerset/Bristol accent
I’d never encountered an accent so strong and I felt so rude not understanding him
It didn’t help that it was busy and he was mumbling anyway but I don’t think I understood at all what he said
Perhaps it was an older accent because [this sort of] Bristol accent, with the ‘l part, I’ve never really heard in person
Either way, was uncomfortable for me since I generally think I’m quite good at understanding accents
Went to Pete's Eats in Llanberis when I went up to visit my mate, living in south Wales conversational Welsh is rare as rocking horse shit
I understood a bit from Duolingo, but no where nesa enough to hold a decent conversation
I suppose we get told that we would starve in the streets
Wales isn’t a collection of tiny islands over a bridge
We were kids (like 11) and she had either moved to the school or was visiting somehow, and because she came over the Severn bridge and came down along the coast she was convinced Wales was hundreds of tiny close together islands
Unfortunately it's kind of waning
There was a road sign in Swansea that [went viral] about 10 years ago
>Unfortunately, the e-mail response to Swansea council said in Welsh: "I am not in the office at the moment
Send any work to be translated".
> So that was what went up under the English version which barred lorries from a road near a supermarket
Yeah, that always struck me as odd
Plus, how did *nobody* on the council spot "swyddfa" in the reply (office) given it would also be on the signage of every post office in the city
No-one only speaks Welsh these days, but there are many who would only learn English in school and speak none at home
Not really - there are people who have Welsh as their first language, but they learn English in school too
I've been to Budapest, fortunately I went in December so it wasn't as full of idiots as I imagine it is at other times
I was embarrassed seeing some of the other Brits (and other nationalities) there who were only looking for cheap alcohol and a shag
We did partake in the cheap alcohol but we also tried to sample some local culture and made sure to learn just a few words and phrases (its really not difficult to learn basic words like Köszönöm)
I've also been to Amsterdam too but wasn't there for as long as I was in Budapest so didn't sample as much of the local culture but still managed a bit (to this day I'm still addicted to Stroopwafels)
We did try out the coffee shops but to be fair only did that on one of the evenings we were there
Two of our group wanted to just spent all day in there while the rest of us (who hadn't been before) wanted to see more of the city
Both are absolutely fantastic cities that I would gladly revisit
I'm usually embarrassed by the Brits I see abroad
Many make absolutely no effort to engage with the local culture and be respectful of the locals (thats a problem with UK tourists in Wales let alone abroad)
I loved Budapest, its a gorgeous city (possibly the prettiest I've been to)
Unfortunately the only way to stop that type of tourism is to make it expensive
Either way köszönöm for your fantastic hospitality
You've got a lovely capital, don't let our knobheads ruin it
It was funny when I went I expected it to be full of UK knobheads looking for coffee shops and the red light district
In reality Germany were playing the Netherlands that weekend (and lost) so it was full of Germans (which as a German speaker who was living in Germany at the time was funny)
I must say though I went to Nijmegen (and Arnhem) to see the bridges from Operation Market Garden and was blown away by how lovely it was
I lived about an hour away from the Dutch-German border so visited a handful of times and really fell in love with the place
Looking forward to visiting again in the future
When I went almost everyone in the party district was UK/ German
20°C today, far more manageable
Last few days have been absolute hell though
There is a saying that to be born Welsh, is to be privileged,  not with a silver spoon in your mouth, but with music in your heart and poetry in your soul
Or if you’re in the South, with a rugby ball in hand lol
Whenever a new baby is born someone always says “he’ll be a rugby player” or “he’ll never be a rugby player”, purely based on the size of the baby
And often describe the middle classes as "people who buy their own furniture"
Although it's a town, [Port Talbot] is the clear winner for Wales
Elevated motorway, identikit terraced housing, huge steelworks just outside the town
Definitely Port Talbot
Steelworks and other industry dominates the landscape and it's not pretty
Ahhh Port Toilet
I thought about putting in a bid for Swansea but go you
Many years ago I visited Krakov
The guide books said not to bother with Nowa Huta as it was an ugly steel town
I like to ride the tram lines on holiday so naturally went there - and it's beautiful
Hahahaha yeah
That takes me back to playing Sim City 2000
*fuck, the city's bankrupt
clicks on **Disasters > Earthquake** menu
I doubt there was much planning going on
I try not to slag off places but I struggled to find any redeeming features on Google Street view
Same
You certainly don't forget the smell
Once driven past, never forgotten
Ah, I've only passed the place on the M4
It stinks if the steelworks is operating
Looks cool at night though
Swansea had a fair bit of regeneration in the last decade, mainly down the waterfront
Not as much as Cardiff but it's a start
I find a lot of guide books are like that - I've read a few things the night before we fly out somewhere, and thought "what the fuck have we booked
Get there the next day and after the second day I love the place
It's like they wrote the guide 25 years ago and never updated it
Yeah, it's not ideal, I don't think there were many other options for building it though
If the steelworks is operating the area stinks, I know what you mean though
Places like Port Talbot and the Stanlow refinery near Ellesmere Port in England do look kinda cool at night
The landscape and coastline can help to forget the ugly buildings around here
There are some amazing walks and bike rides around Port Talbot
I suspect that guide book writers don't like the same stuff I do - guide books are still great to find some nice places though
Cardiff is running out of sites to redevelop to the extent that they built on the bus station, the rest of Wales not so much
Lack of mental healthcare and bad social safety nets
Someone's never been to the UK
I was in an airbnb in Paris, and it turned out the dude was just renting out his bedroom to us, and living in the adjoining living room
A little bit more personal than we wanted but that’s fine
He also was using either the toilet in ‘our’ bedroom or another flats
Anyway, we just decide to spend the large majority of our time out of the room
After the second day, we get in to see a note on the bed complaining about how we left his room a mess, and all of our clothes neatly placed on radiators and in our bags
Now, to be fair we had left the room in a bit of a mess
But it was our private room, according to the description
Clothes left about the room is hardly extreme, and we were leaving the next day
Made us feel very uncomfortable and we were glad to get away, especially before he did/said something else
Not really holiday because I was living in Germany at the time but I was on a train in Goslar in Central Germany and this guy comes and sits next to me smiling
I gave him the nod of acknowledgement but didn't say anything but after a few minutes he started talking to me, fortunately my German is okay so I was able to keep up with him but he had a really weird accent
Anyway he thought I was his colleague and didn't believe me when I told him that I wasn't, at one point he even told me to stop doing that stupid accent because I sounded like a "Spasti". After that I pretended that it was my stop and moved to the other end of the train
Was on holiday in france, visiting the american landing grounds, and when we where in sainte mere eglise a italian couple in a french hire car reversed back and hit us and dented our car, now not so strange but, they spoke to us in fluent english and the man even spoke to me in welsh for some of it
Weird times
I think they have, in general, gotten a little better over time
It sometimes felt like some people took it as they had a new housemate rather than a stranger who is there for a holiday or work
I remember a host in Bourges treating me and my girlfriend at the time like 2 of her children, feeding us, driving us around
Was lovely but slightly overbearing
Had to give her a top review though, since we wouldn't have been able to get our bus out of the city without her
Well, I was a naive 18 year old and on a long summer trip, so I think I gave the host too much credit in the review, though I definitely mentioned his invasion of privacy
Well, out of more than 15 Airbnbs, that's the worst I've had
Another contender would be a private room in Lyon, where it was just a mattress on the floor, with a bunch of laundry in the room, but that was clear from the booking
There were some strange individuals in the living room at times, and a shopping trolley on the balcony, but again, was a cheap room and nothing bad happened
All other Airbnbs have been from okay to brilliant, including a full apartment in Munich with a sauna that was incredibly cheap
Should say, another weird experience was our taxi driver from the train station to this building in Lyon accidentally came to the end of the one way street from the wrong side
So he just shrugged and reversed down it, as if that means he's obeying the one way signs, was quite funny
I'm not an expert in Airbnb by any means
All I meant was nowadays it's less likely you'll end up in a guys living room with a cat that won't stop licking you or something else stupid and unadvertised
If you want to rent a decent room in a city, Airbnb can often be a good idea
Does it matter than the company has moved into a different part of the market
You can still do "couchsurfing with money" with other sites
This is true
I fully support cities and countries creating laws to specifically curtail this sort of business, or tax correctly at least
Parts of Wales had and still have a similar problem where people buy 2nd homes and then they are vacant throughout the winter months
Some villages with up to 70% of the homes being not regular homes
While Airbnb turns a somewhat blind-eye to this buying-to-rent on their website, cities still have the power to mitigate and change the effects around these prices
There are also still plenty of listings on Airbnb that are private rooms or apartments people have traveled away from for a while
Of the ones I have visited, 11 of 15 have been that
The ones that weren't what Airbnb was orignally supposed to be were a very hotel style apartment in Venice, one was a large flat in central Berlin, that would've been for maybe one or two people as a residence but was rented out as a 7 bedroom property and the rest were the classic airbnb apartments that have been discussed
I can't vouch for how good these are as I haven't use them, but google gives the literal "couchsurfing" app, as well as ones called "HomeStay", "HomeAway" and "Tripping". Additionally, if you pick an Airbnb that is clearly a spare room or lived in flat, then you aren't damaging the city in the way a specifically "Airbnb" flat might
Picture 2 looks 'familiar', I think I've been there - is it Orta San Giulio
Have you ever been out on a NYE
This is quiet if anything, it’s just the near renaissance position of the bloke with the pint
It’s of course a tongue in cheek thing but Britain is notorious for this behaviour
North Wales
Largely forgotten and cut off from the rest of Wales (have to travel to England 1st if going to South Wales via public transport)
And to top it all off theyre being invaded by scousers
Poor gogs
I'd say we're largely forgotten by Cardiff Bay, yeah
The seaside resorts and castles along the coast do still attract holidaymakers from England, particularly Merseyside
Honestly though I'd answer "The Valleys" to the OP's question, the economy of the area was ruined when the likes of the coal mines and steel works all closed down
The Welsh Government publish a data set called the Index of Multiple Deprivation
It’s ranks small clusters of 1,500 people by factors such as health, education, housing conditions
Rhyl is bottom on just about every metric
I mean, Wales as a whole isn’t doing great compared to the rest of the UK
So to be bottom of that table shows just how bad it is there
On the plus side you can’t get a nice 3 bed new build for like £110k. With the rise of remote working i do wonder if those towns might be a bit more attractive
Who am I kidding, Rhyl is beyond hope
>And to top it all off theyre being invaded by scousers
Poor gogs
I wouldn't worry too much
Just make a tin foil Premier league trophy for those bin dippers
Let em think they stole it off us and then theyll leave ya alone
Scousers have a simple mind
They are like magpies, they See something shiny then they just gotta nick it
I live in the valleys so was trying to avoid saying that ;)
Its unfortunate that areas with low populations get completely forgotten all over the UK
Transport for me would be the biggest possiblity for change
Reopening the Carmarthen to Aberystwyth railway would be a huge step in the right direction, trains could run directly from Pwllheli to Cardiff then
[careful what you wish for]
Yup, fully agreed on the transport
Apologies for bringing The Valleys back up, but it is the clearest example for me
A lot of people don’t know about [Owain Glyndwr ] and his war for Welsh independence in the 1400s. Ultimately it was unsuccessful, but it’s a very cool story
Wales was never brought into the U.K. willingly, even Scotland at least had a shared monarch and some papers were signed
Wales was a conquest
At the time there were separate laws for Welsh and English people
Welsh people were 2nd class citizens
Glyndwr managed to control the whole country independently of  English rule for around 2 years, being recognised by both the Scottish and French crowns at the time
Eventually it was ended but he disappeared from the castle they were sieging at the end
Now there’s a myth that if Wales is ever in danger again he will emerge from somewhere
I remember reading somewhere last year that a lot of people, even in the wider UK, were only just learning about the [Aberfan Disaster] because it featured prominently in Series 3 of the Netflix series *The Crown*.
Yeah, it's over 50 years ago now, but it's a shame that it doesn't seem to be taught in schools across the UK
IIRC it was mentioned to us *once* in prmary school
Well contrary to the other commenters
I thought I’d say that I had never heard of this before, so thanks
Merched Beca
I suppose modern context is hard to get across now there are no coal mines - but we can all relate to the "school full of children buried alive" part, surely
Indeed - I wasn't suggesting you wouldn't empathise with them or anything
I vaguely remember it was mentioned *once* when I was in school, in terms of how quick we'd done a fire drill or something
So not even in history class
Yup, but honestly there's so much UK history past about the end of WWII that I just sort of learned about once I'd finished school, you  know
Funnily enough this sort of discussion has come up in a few UK subreddits now, given all the protests in the USA and some of the UK's own BAME / Empire issues
Maybe looking back to all the Tudors, Romans, Celts etc needs to be 'paused' for a while
It should be
No one likes it
Don’t do it
This might sound cruel, and I love cats, but I don’t think you do the animal any good by feeding it on the street where it can breed and create more stray cats
Better to turn it into a shelter or catch/neuter/release
This one is strange to me
I’ve been going to the cinema by myself for years
What’s the point of going with friends, they either talk and ruin the film or you can’t interact with them because of the film
But then again, I usually go to the cinema 1-2 times per week, because I am a film critic
I like going alone but find it very different to watching at home because the picture quality and atmosphere is superior
The letter “LL/ll” and the sound it makes
Linguistically it is a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative
[This video ] shows how it sounds
I believe this sound is similar to one in the Trondheim dialect of Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroese and Greenlandic
It’s also in a lot of Native American and Caucasian languages, but in terms of Europe and where Welsh is spoken it’s a pretty unique sound
I’ve seen it compared to the Welsh “hiraeth” too but I believe the Welsh can be more specifically a place
Welsh has the word “hiraeth” which means pretty much the same thing :)
> we don’t technically have words for “yes” and “no”
Same in Welsh
Just move the time by 30 minutes and be done with the whole damn charade
Many Huguenots also came to the U.K. where they developed a silk-weaving industry
People liked French stuff at the time, so they also worked as French tutors, and people went to their church choirs to learn French too
In London, there’s a house (Dennis Severs house) in Shoreditch where most of the rooms are displayed as if being used by a family of Huguenots from the early 18th century to the early 20th century
The room at the top stinks of urine, for example, because that was used in the silk-weaving process
Many famous people in the U.K. are of Huguenot descent, such as Farage
Such an interesting history
They came in the 16th century and also after 1680
However people were much less friendly to German refugees from 1708-10 because they weren’t usually skilled workers, and they were encouraged to move onto the American colonies
Probably Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch for Wales
It's a small town with a really long name, which was basically made up to attract tourists
The highlights are taking a photo of [the sign] at the [railway station] and going to the sort of [gift shop] there, which sells the usual sort of [generic Welsh themed stuff]
I feel like explaining its made up, but contains actual Welsh words and has a very long translation
Someone didn't just mash the typewriter one day
I don't think the Waitrose was a thing when I visited in the`1990s! If I was passing I'd probably drop in again, but that's what the coach tours tend to do anyway
Yeah, the other problem is that station is a 'request stop', many trains just fly through at like 70 mph normally :P
Most tour groups arrive by bus
Good point, I should have mentioned that because the whole 'someone mashed a typewriter' 'joke' pisses me off, yeah
Yes, I remember being surprised at the size of the shop when I visited
If it was a local train, the crews will look for people waving the train down
Or someone on the train wanted to get off there :P
Ah but do you surstromming
I second the last point
Quite a bit then fair play
If you go through the Channel Tunnel, the music changes to the first couple lines of God Save The Queen and you somehow emerge in the middle of Westminster Bridge
The Valleys
I mean, [just look at it]
basically any non-welsh show with welsh characters in it
Imagine thinking arianism has anything to do with race lol
Ah yes the 4th reich theory
I don't think I've met anyone who seriously believes that one
Its just something to say to get the Germans upset
You certain
Sounds incredibly cynical that to me tbh
I didn't think *anyone* handwrites 'a'? I thought it was just a printing typeface thing
Technically wouldn't it be the citizens of the city of Rome who'd wanna retake constantinople
Surely you Greeks would wanna retake Iran
Only if you lot are subordinate to us Welsh
With the seat of power residing in Cardiff
Why stop there
Let's take the entirety of Europe and set up a united kingdoms of Europe
Cornwall and Wales both (sadly) voted for Brexit
Pretty decidedly
If you go you'd have to hand back the Premier league
I'm sure that would make an awful lot of mancs happy
Driving age: 16
Join the Army/ buy a gun: 18
Buy a beer: 21
Wtf
Yeah I remember when I was 16 me and my friends used to joke about this "legally we can have sex but can't watch videos of sex".
Consuming too much alcohol is bad for you no matter how old you are
What's at question here is at what age do we consider people capable of making informed and responsible decisions about their lifestyles and health
This site looks a bit basic, but has a table comparing the US and UK school systems, particularly the way the year groups match up
We had a Welsh flag outside our school too
I’m trying to remember if I saw any outside others but can’t remember
Definitely more common in Ireland, though I see a lot of Welsh flags here
I know a house around the corner with one on a pole, and even the nearby industrial estate has a Welsh, St David’s and I believe sometimes an Irish and Scottish flag
IIRC British pints are larger than American ones :P
I have been told it would be relatively easy for the UK to convert things like our road signs to metric - apparently a lot of the road signs are placed at metric intervals, but still say '1/2 mile' or similar
Yup, I'm in the same boat
Taught mm, cm and metres at school
I can convert *some* measurements between things like MPH and Km/h, but that's mainly down to things like watching a lot of F1 and having an interest in railways
The last time I was in hospital, I had a pre-operative assessment where they gave me my height in cm and weight in kg
I had to ask for the measurements in feet and inches, and stones
When Wales play in the rugby everybody takes the day off
Not legally but everyone is "sick" ;)
>Saturday sauna
Peak Finland
Every service job I’ve worked has done this
Everyone just shrugs their shoulders and gets on with it
It’s stupid
The two owners would also split the tip with themselves too
Thing is you lose respect for the workplace then
I regularly gave out free drinks and took ones for myself in the end because I knew exactly where the cameras were and I didn’t care about the business
If they’d actually treated us with some respect I would’ve done the same back
Lol also means something in Welsh
Not 100% on the correct translation but I think it would be something like silliness
We get the double whammy of being overwhelmed domestically by our neighbours in England and being overwhelmed internationally by the US
Over the last 3 years, it's become [increasingly clear] that one of the few ways to find news from Wales is to watch the evening news on BBC Wales - ie the 30 minute 'local' news after the main evening news bulletin
Major stories from Wales barely seem to feature on the 'national' news in the UK
It led to a ridiculous situation where before covid most people in Wales didn't know who the first minister was or what the Welsh Government actually did
I believe one poll showed that most people thought the UK Government ran education and healthcare in Wales
I think the Netherlands maybe
On paper id say Finland or Sweden but I've read that people are more reserved on talking to strangers so I might get a bit lonely
Below 10 I'll wear a thin jacket, below 5 I'll wear a good warm jacket
Anything above 15 is barbecue weather
I don't think of three words, more so a map (with the isles featuring a bit more prominently) and a few feelings
But if I were to describe those feelongs in three words it would probably be: Home, Pride, Serenity
It’s a bit annoying when you wake up and go to work or uni in the dark and then get home and it’s dark again, but also, I don’t really need it to be light
You just do more inside activities like board games and video games, go to the cinema and the pub, watch fireworks and drink more hot drinks
I’ve never really had a problem with it being dark
As other people have said, it does sound like you may have seasonal depression, as the feelings about the dark seem to be quite powerful, whereas for me it doesn’t really cross my mind except to answer things like this
Winter is always a bit depressing, but I guess we're just used to it to an extent
The football/ rugby being on gives me something to look forward to, and I tend to spend more time in the pub during the winter than the summer so I guess thats how I cope haha
Sometimes a night time walk is nice, the cold crisp air seems fresher than it does in summer, and if you live near to a city then seeing the lights in the distance is quite beautiful
When its wet and horrible then theres nothing better than snuggling up on the sofa with a cup of hot chocolate to watch a film
Personally, I've voted for Plaid Cymru in full belief
Whilst they are a bit controversial here in Wales because of their desire for Welsh Independence, it does seem that they truly want what is best for Wales as opposed to ohter parties which almost just see having a  majority in the Senedd as a way to solidify votes in the UK general elections
I'm not fully decided on whether I fully support independence, but it's hard to deny that Plaid's policies and ideas have Welsh people's interests in mind - for example, a railway connecting the North and South as there are currently no real transport links outside of single-~~lane~~ carriageway roads or England
"Single-carriageway" roads, surely
Otherwise, yeah
Plaid are appealing more and more to me recently
The "problem" I have is that a) my constituency is generally a safe Labour seat for both Westminster and the Senedd, and b) our local MP and AM are decent chaps who speak up on behalf of the area
Plaid would feel like a bit of a 'wasted vote' in some ways, sadly
That's what I meant, yeah, apologies
My constituency is very safe conservative, and yes Plaid is almost a wasted vote for me too
But if everybody adopted that attitude, then no steps will be made towards the party's progress in that constituency
I consider it worth voting anyway and especially spreading awareness of Plaid's policies - I've found a lot of people in my area aren't too sure what they're all about so it's worth introducing them
Hey, no worries - it still makes getting north to south a pain in the arse
I agree on your second paragraph, too
As others have said Plaid need people to stop seeing them as some kind of party for rural folk and Welsh speakers
EDIT: I do think they need more media coverage outside of Wales too
That's very true
Personally I think Adam Price's appearances in the TV debates last year did a lot for their popularity, he is a very likeable party leader
I'd say Leanne Wood before him was similar, too
She always came across well in debates
I had a British passport thanks to my dad so I moved out of sheer boredom to his hometown
Been in Wales for 3 years now
Sadly no
People who say Wales is part of England lol
The only thing that is worse is when people jump or push in to a queue
That is tantamount to heresy here
This I can understand, sure there is some cultural crossover between us but I could definitely see why that misunderstanding could easely get on your tits
Oh fuck yes
This is a biggie
So damn annoying
I mean it is isn't it
Anything that was behind the iron curtain during the cold War is technically Eastern Europe
Right
It is a geographic fact though
Its called the British Isles because the largest island in the chain is called Britain and that naming convention has been around since the days of ancient Greece, their name for our Isles was the Prettanikē Isles
That's where we get the name britanic from and which has evolved into British
Lmfao, not quite
The UN would disagree
They class Poland as an Eastern European nation
No, but the common perception is that Poland is an Eastern European nation
You joined the EU with a bunch of other Eastern European States on the 1st of May 2004
So yeah perception is that Poland is a Eastern European state
I'd imagine the naming convention only really applies to island groups/chains and not peninsulas so there is that
Honestly I don't see why it winds you lads up so much, it's only a name, you have your own language so come up with a new name for the british Isles in Irish or something
Problem solved
>Ancient Greek is a bit of a reach
The earliest know reference to the “British Isles” is by John Dee, a propagandist and advisor to Elizabeth I. It was most definitely a political term,
Yet I have info that would say otherwise
" "Britain" comes from Latin: Britannia~Brittania, via Old French Bretaigne and Middle English Breteyne, possibly influenced by Old English Bryten(lond), probably also from Latin Brittania, ultimately an adaptation of the Common Brittonic name for the island, *Pritanī.[1][2]
An early written reference to the British Isles may derive from the works of the Greek explorer Pytheas of Massalia; later Greek writers such as Diodorus of Sicily and Strabo who quote Pytheas' use of variants such as Πρεττανική (Prettanikē), "The Britannic [land, island]", and nēsoi brettaniai, "Britannic islands", with *Pretani being a Celtic word that might mean "the painted ones" or "the tattooed folk", referring to body decoration "
From :
So the term British Isles goes much further back then Elizabethen times and stretched back into classical antiquity
It most definitely is not a political phrase, no matter how you'd like to frame it otherwise
No disputing Czechia but then they have had a bit of a rebranding I suppose
Still to most western European people I'd argue that Poland is still seen as  an Eastern European nation
Lol fair one  nice turn around there
Seriously though the whole Atlantic achepelego/ North atlantic Isles, Anglo celt lsles phrase  doesn't roll off the tounge quite as well as British Isles
For the sake of expedencey the name British Isles should stay
And yet you still use the English language for that
If ya gonna use English, then use the English name for these islands
When you start using gaelige then you can start dictating terms
But as we are both using English then the term British Isles stands
And yet it is still in common usage
This is English we are both conversing in right now
And as such the English naming conventions apply
You may not like it, if so you can call these Isles something else in Irish
But as we are both speaking English then the English naming convention applies here
But yes, I mean we are both conversing in English are we not
So the English naming convention applies here, its common name is the British Isles in English so the name stands
And yet it's the smaller country Both geographicly, and economically
British Isles is more accurate
But they do have a group name, it's called the E.U
Yeah, and in those cases they are using their own native tounges to rename such places
That is cool and to be expected
Yet what you are talking about is changing names and terms in English that already have English names so this is a faulty analogy
As I've said earlier, if you wanna change the name in Irish, to an Irish name for use in Ireland go ahead
Like the French have with the English channel, they call it la manche
We dont, its called the English channel
So why not name the British Isles something more  palatable to your ears in Irish for Irish usage and not worry about how we in the UK name the islands
Expedencey sure, but not at the cost of accuracy
The continent is called North America
The US is commonly called America, yet North America contains Mexico, the USA and Canada
There is no diffence here, the islands are called the british Isles yet contain eire and the UK
I wonder if the canucks and Mexicans are as sensitive as you paddys are or if they don't let this sorta thing phase em
>The UK don't officially refer to the islands as the British Isles, never did actually
It is only the ignorant and rigid assholes who continue to do this
And yet it's still used in common parlance every day, check any map and you'll find the term British Isles in usage
So no it is not only the ignorant or assholes that use it, the only people who seam to have a problem with the term are  paddies with a chip on their shoulders like you
>And my analogy is not faulty as we no longer call Beijing Peking or Bombay Mumbai in English either
We don't continue to call them by their old names as a sign of respect to the people of these countries and what they'd prefer to be called
Yes it is a faulty snology because these people don't use English as their mother tounge, they have native names for these places and have reverted to using those names for those places
The native name for these islands is the British Isles, the name has been used for thousands of years right back into classical antiquety asi have already stated
So your analogy is deeply flawed in that respect
>Naming conventions are not rigid or set in stone and I don't know how it would hurt you to just call it something like the British and Irish Isles (Britain can come first)
We evolve the English language all the time with words falling out of fashion and using new terminology that's more accurate or inclusive
But this is not our problem, the problem is yours
Why should we bend over backwards to accommodate a problem we don't suffer from
The British Isles is an inclusive term, and it's geographicly accurate as it refers to the largest island in the archapeligo
>As for the English Channel, French is the sole official language of France while Ireland has two official languages: Irish and English
It wouldn't be palatable for us to call it the British Isles in English
Then use an Irish term, you have for the Irish Republic, you call it eira,  so why not use an Irish term for the british Isles
It's your tounge so use it for that purpose
The term British Isles is an English term, you don't have to use it
The still reverted to their native names
The native name of the British Isles is
The British Isles,
not a hard  concept to grasp
Yet you really refuse to accept it eh
Or Britain and Ireland
Or just British Isles as Ireland really is the junior partner in this whole operation
>I understand the concept may be challenging for somebody from Wales
Ooooh  no need to get nasty now lol
In Britain nobody does it so I was shocked when I went on holiday to Spain
I think we can probably forgive him for only speaking five languages
We're coming for you, Antarctica
Gonna fuck some penguins right up
Shit me, we've found one in the wild
Then again if Ireland doesn't break into the top 50 it shows what atrocities the UK has done
Mari Lwyd is making a small comeback in Wales
A hobby horse is made from a horses skull, a pole, and a cloak for someone to hide under
The skull is decorated and has a veil
Around Christmas and the new year, Mari Lwyd will visit your house or a pub and demand to be let in
You'll sing verses or Pwnco to each other to stop her from entering but you want to lose
Mari Lwyd will then run around your house chasing away bad spirits for the new year, and causing mischief chasing kids and taking food and drink
It’s making a comeback
Mari Lwyd always creeped me out as a kid
Id' say it's making a resurgence
she appeared last year in my local pub for the first time
and a couple of other Bridgend pubs
I don't think there's a speficic music or dance that goes with it
The dance and music reminds me of Morris dancing
Is there an event for the Capra
A Welshman who doesn’t like rugby
Edit: not me mind
Not a fan of rugby, can't play it nor can I sing or compose poetry
Pretty much failed the basic criteria
Slowly raises hand
This is the correct awnser
Not exactly a horror story but I have never been groped on public transport or anything like that
Went to Paris, got groped twice on the metro
each time I completely froze, but the second time I thought it wasn’t happening for a second or so because it had literally just happened the other day and because it started when he pressed against me like someone could conceivably do on a busy train
Paris was otherwise genuinely full of friendly people (contrary to stereotypes) imo, beautiful, amazing cities and I stayed in a great hostel but I never want to go back ever
I accept I could have just been as unlucky in any other city and most women won’t have this experience but I just associate being on the metro with my holiday experience
I love French history and I’ve put a lot of effort into learning French so it kind of sucks that for me Paris is off the map now
Edit: thanks for suggestions of places, I have been to other places in France and hope to go elsewhere, in fact I’m sad thinking about how many places I can’t go in my lifetime
I hoped to go to Avignon this year haha but covid stopped that
A load of Sheep managed to find an illegal cannabis farm, ate the whole thing and then (presumably stoned) terrorised a nearby village
So, the county I live in decided to rename the popular British dessert ["Spotted Dick"] to "Spotted Richard". Apparently too many people were being rather *immature* when ordering it in the cafeteria  at the council HQ
This news story went viral and they spent the next few days as a global laughing stock, before backing down
Or, as tech news site *The Register* put it:
[UK council forced to swallow dick]
Fantastic, where was that
Ha, that reminds me of the time a guy in my nearest town tried to take a pony [on the train to Holyhead]
Nothing will beat the time some people resprayed an Arriva train into the colours of [Nederlandse Spoorwegen]
Somewhere near to Swansea I believe
Yeah that's a fair point
I doubt it will be changed now though
> Rhydypandy
Seems to be just north of Swansea
Not as rural as I was expecting
Yeah, just looked it up on Google Maps
Not quite where I was expecting
Well yes :P
I meant which village
Welshman here, not a clue
Maggie Thatcher or Eddie Jones (England Rugby manager who called Wales and Ireland "little shit places")
Dafydd Gam I suppose
Fought for the English against his fellow Welshmen
Is well regarded in England as he died at Agincourt, not so much here
>don't think there's really a near-universal hate figure like Petain or so on
Well there is Margaret Thatcher
Most people I know have very little of a positive nature to say about her
Good call on William the conqueror though
You'd think he would be hated but 1000 years of history is quite a long time to hold a grudge
There's an argument that Britain's nationalised industries, like coal and steel, were in pretty poor shape in the 1970s and 1980s, in the grip of trade unions, there was a need for either reform or closure
In some ways that's fair enough
Britain had the reputation as "the sick man of Europe" in the 1970s, industrial strikes were rife, there was a three day week etc
However, those industries were closed down with little or no retraining and education put in place to support their former workers
It's left former coal mining areas like the [South Wales Valleys] suffering from the effects of *generations* of poverty to this day
EDIT: changed a few sentences
Aye I hope that bitch maggie burns in hell
There are still mining towns in wales that haven't recovered from that cows vendetta against miners 36 years later
The more I've read up on it, the more I've realised you can't pin it all on Maggie
Maybe you could say her Government helped finish those industries off
Then again, despite all the privatisations of gas, water, electric and telecoms that her Government presided over, privatising the railways was a step too far for Mrs T.
But the effects of the coal mines closing are still being felt to this day, so I needed to lead in to the article I linked
I've actually learned quite a lot from comments and links people have provided on Reddit over the years
Particularly when Maggie died
I think the pronunciation is okay with the exception of a few sounds that are hard to pronounce
The grammar is impossible thanks to mutations but I think it’s possible to sound close to a native speaker
Well, there’s so many accents even in native English that it’s basically pointless to try and learn one
I don’t see the point really as long as I can understand you
That being said, I once met someone from Lithuania who learnt English here and he had the weirdest Lithuanian-Welsh combination accent and that was great
I’m all for people speaking in their natural accent, linguistic diversity is more interesting
That normally gives it away that you're not a native speaker if you obey the mutations
To properly sound like a native speaker you need to put contractions upon contractions and ignore the proper mutations in favour of what sounds most natural after being contracted
I was about to say this
I now a Danish guy on Diacord and I asked him:
"so where are you from, cause you sound English but you're one hour ahead of me
He asked me to guess and I said south East England somewhere (I guessed he was studying abroad or something)
Then he tells me he's Danish and has only been to England for about a total of 2 weeks in his whole life
The English for inventing football
Spain for showing us how to play it properly
France and Italy for all the food recipes
And finally Ze Germans for the cars
Yeah, I noticed that, I guess it was a reference to Noraid and Irish Americans rather than the USA
They have 60 minutes to fill rather than the 30 minutes of the main BBC / ITV broadcasts, though
>larger than ... the Isle of Man
Best celebrate with a motorcycle race then
> in the UK we used to use Wales for size, until they actually started complaining
I don't recall us complaining about that
We can't win, lol
Oh, that's a good way of changing it round
England, although it's rarely reciprocated outside of Rugby Union :P
As a welshman, the only rivalry we can have is with England, because they're the only country we border
But obviously as a Briton we have a bit of a rivalry with France, as there is a lot of history between us fighting
England
but its mostly while playing rugby and things like that
*British/Celtic Isles Thunderdome*
That just seems to be the way Wales go, I think
Grand Slam one year, battling for the Wooden Spoon the next :P
Shaun Edwards, surely
Gareth is off doing travel documentaries now, he was going round Wales in a canal boat last time I looked
No worries, I can barely remember what day it is now
I really don't get the resort holidays a lot of Brits seem to like in places like Spain/ Cyprus/ Turkey
They literally don't leave the hotel the entire time they're there, apart from to go to the beach of course and only mingle with other Brits
If I've spent all that money and time to go somewhere I want to see a bit more of the place then just a hotel and a beach and I want to learn at least something about the country I'm in and it's history and culture
Maybe its just because I'm not a beach holiday kind of person in general
Welsh and English
Moron - Idiot in English; Carrot in Welsh
(On mobile) if you go on the subreddit and click the ••• in the corner, select ‘change user flair’ and pick your country out of the list
Well, I guess that we are doing kind of ok here with there being pros and cons
Pros
- Having good connections via the sea
- Very defensible, mainly if you use the terrain to your advantage
- Lots of profitable ventures to be had - wool, coal, slate, iron and steel, sheep, cows, leather
- Beautiful scenery
Cons
- Very unfortunate neighbours *cough England cough*
- Mainly mountainous terrain although it is beautiful and all that it does make the land fairly hard to traverse
- Because of the terrain it's quite hard to grow crops
Alright except the neighbours east make a lot of noise
Yeah but when England does something the rest of the world thinks that Britain did it
Either way, sorry Ireland
Welcome home
In Welsh toilet is “ty bach”, small house, from the toilets being in a small building outside
So you might say you’re going to the little house
Similar it seems
Nah, over here they where pretty much the subject of ridicule and laughter
Ladas were most popular about 30 years ago in the UK back when the cheap simplicity of the build was on par with other makes
You bought different makes for either the few mod cons or the image
Once the other makes were able to provide more mod cons and improvements, the Lada went the way of the Dodo
Funnily enough, Skoda was the same, but if you ever owned a Skoda, you would still look down on a Lada
No where else in the world I have been almost ran over by a scooter as many times as I have in Naples
You say that
But as Queen she does have royal perogative
She could quite easely command some tough as nails royal protection officer to slap seven shades of shit outta anyone who approaches her
Never underestimate a old royal
Not many royals get to the age of 94
It would be a bad time to fi d out why that old bird has endured so long lol
Especially if he's got his dogs
My Chinese friend was complaining that his housemate's cat had fleas and he'd been bitten
He said saffron was good to rub on the bites, which I thought was extravagant considering the price
We argued in confusion for a minute and he ran to his room and came back with a tube of Savlon antiseptic cream *facepalm*
> Yes, this measure could be different for different parts of Russia too
Once I've been to Yaroslavl and had trouble with roaming and the manager in a store said that it is easier for me to go to Kostroma and buy sim-cart there
For context, where are you travelling from
Omsk
The second map certainly gets your point across
Wales is a nation of alcoholics so its completely normal
The US has a very puritan view to drinking imo, but it's weird, when ever I see TV shows people are often drink driving which is frowned upon in the UK
>If all 4 of them have drinking competition who would win
England would leave to do coke in the toilets half way through and wouldn't be seen for the rest of the night
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would end up singing outside a kebab shop/ chippy at 5am
I think it's Finland (somebody will correct if wrong) actually have a term for sitting at home in your pants getting drunk :)
Sure, but conversely, all those laws which say you can't enjoy a glass of wine with a picnic in a park, that's just uncivil
TIL Finland classes me as an alcoholic
Saturday night in Bristol = Tuesday morning in Leeds
I would say Bristol was a bad shout, though it’s not so much drinking to get drunk but more of all other substances going on there
To be honest I was struggling to think of Southern cities with good nightlife
Still whatever goes on in Bristol happens x20 in Leeds
Half the country descending on Cardiff city centre/local pubs around the country on international rugby match days, drinking a lot and singing
When I was small a girl in Ireland (in a hotel) did this on purpose to me once on a staircase
I still have nightmares
That is literally my favourite sentence
You couldn’t have known but this is like precisely my sense of humour hahaha
Chips, cheese, curry - nothing better after a night out
Aye, that is the food of champions that tbf
Thank god you explained that
For a second I thought you guys might have been selling the other kind of "spice" at ya local takeaways
Totally forgot about these beauties
I wouldn't call it fast food per say but it is definitely a underrated bit of munch
A pie butty maybe
I know ya jocks are into ya weird shit lol
In terms of things like Government institutions, no
They'll often fly the Welsh and UK flags, and until recently maybe the EU flag too
You do tend to see more Welsh flags flown during sporting events, particularly events like the Six Nations rugby tournament and the Rugby World Cup
'Normally' - yes, you do see a few houses with the Welsh flag flying - it's almost the reverse of the situation in England
Yes, it can be classed as nationalist, but there aren't the same sort of right wing associations with flying the flag
A lot of people don't consider the Union Flag to represent Wales as we were technically conquered by England when the UK was founded
In Wales
We definitely have the welsh flag out for St David’s day, Yr Urdd and the Eisteddfod
Always up for our municipal building and government branches
In my job, which is working with children
We display the Welsh culture more prominently, then British
It's very popular in Wales to have the Welsh flag everywhere
Tea towels, mugs, ornaments, car stickers
The Union Jack is less abundant
Its more normal to fly a Wales or St David's flag than a UK one here
A lot of people I know own a flag but don't fly/ display it (it comes our for the rugby)
I've seen a few houses in the South-west flying flags
Not been down that way since last year, mind you
Yes, it's much smaller than the Scottish one, but I feel that the 'penny has dropped' following things like the Brexit vote
Sure, Wales voted to Leave the EU, but there are entire towns that [were rebuilt with EU funding] People in cities like Swansea - Wales' *second city* - [have eventually realised] that they've lost a lot of infrastructure projects that were once promised
So there have been some [rallies about Independence] that sort of thing
EDIT: IIRC support for Welsh independence varies, as [this link suggests] Figures from 7% to 30% have been quoted, but the questions that lead to those figures are often very different
Pretty much, I would add that some polls are putting support for independence as high as 30% which is up from less that 5% in 2015
[Three generations of the same family working as miners] this is pretty much what most of South Wales was like from the industrial revolution until the 1980s, when the mines were all shut (still a controversial issue)
If your dad was a miner then chances are that you'd be down the mines by the time you were a teenager, it was literally the only source of income in many towns, so naturally the death of the mining industry was devastating for Wales, especially the South Wales Valleys
We still haven't economically recovered and the Valleys are the poorest region in Western/ Northern Europe
I pay £27 for unlimited 5G data in the UK
Includes unlimited calls too
When I was working in a pub you definitely could tell which people thought they were outright better than you because you were working there
Sometimes I think increased by the fact you’re young
The majority of customers are normal, you don’t remember the interactions
Then there’s a handful who think they become your boss for the time their in the establishment
It’s been a few years now and I’m not sure I could allow people to clap or whistle to get my attention like some sort of dog
Depends on your network really
I don't go with the cheapest, I go for good coverage
Wikipedia also says that *Newsround* broke some other major stories:
>The programme was also first in Britain to report an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in Vatican City in 1981 and provided the first reports from the Windsor Castle fire of November 1992
IIRC it was on the Children's BBC segment at 5pm, so they could get stories like *Challenger* exploding ahead of the main evening news at 6pm
A few more from the UK:
**Chain** - roughly 20
116 metres
Still used to measure distances on our railway network - eg a station being 11 miles and 62 chains from London
**Furlong** - roughly 201 metres
Still used as a unit of measurement in horse racing
**Barleycorn** - about 8
47 millimetres
For some reason this is still used as a basis of measurement for shoe size
Oh, good call
We're still using this weird half and half mix in the UK
It would be easier if we just went fully metric and allowed for things like 'pint' as a colloquial term or something
I was a GP in Bristol at a practice that had a lot of students register each year
We were having this very debate - is stone still in use (I'm only 35) so some computer whizz looked at the new patient registration forms which had the option to give weight in stone or kg and found that something like 75% of students (so people aged 18-21 in 2017) gave their weight in stone
So I'm always confused when I encounter Redditors who claim that 'no one uses stone' because my personal experience is the vast majority of people use it, and everyone understands it
tbh mate we're all banging models and driving Ferraris over here, we don't worry about how much our trips will cost
The Welsh language
When I was younger and had to learn it in school I really didn't see the point in learning a language that so few people speak (500,000 isn't a particularly low number but thats how I thought) especially because my area has very few Welsh speakers, we used to joke that there was no point learning unless you wanted to live in Argentina or North Wales
Now one of my biggest regrets is not trying harder with Welsh and I really wish I could speak it
I'm going to give it another go once I've graduated from university
Yeah it pains me to see people that still have my former attitude
I get it when youre in school and youre forced to do something you will dislike it but surely once youre an adult you should learn to appreciate it at the very least, even if you have no intention of learning it yourself
Sadly there are still many people that want to see the language die
I left wales at a young age, but still identify myself as welsh and i am slowly but surely relearning the language becuase having a basic outsiders view point has made me realsie the importance of the preservation of languages and cultrues
Yeah for me my opinion started to change when I went off to England for university
England
Ireland
Scotland
Cheating here but Vikings, if pushed Denmark over Norway I think, but whichever not in this one, would be in 5
France
Far far more about England than any of the others really
Ireland in the earlier history with raids but also to do with Christianity
Lowland Scotland was historically Brythonic and spoke old Welsh
After that England sort of drew a wedge between us
Viking’s were nowhere near as involved in Wales as in England, but there were a few settlements along the coast, mainly Swansea (Sweyn’s Sea), named after a Danish king
France acknowledged our independence for a few years during Owain Glyndwr’s revolt and sent some troops over
Brittany is a Celtic region with relations with Wales
For Wales, it'd be something like this:
England
Ireland
USA
France
Argentina
England
Scotland
Rome
Ireland
The rest of the empire
England
Romans(obviously not a country but not much I can add)
At least as a group the Norsemen/Viking’s
Haven’t got a clue past that
Huh good shout, I guess we'll have to drop France then
aha
In the 19th Century, a number of Welsh left for Patagonia to set up a Welsh colony, free from English rule and language
They formed the nucleus for Patagonian colonisation, and there are still many Welsh speakers and large cultural influences
The colony's name was "Y Wladfa", lit
The Colony
Please, search it up~
We're very descriptive at naming things xD
A lot of the signatures on the US Declaration of Independence are also Welsh descendants
A few of them even spoke the language fluently too
I honestly don't see the issue, people who want to waste money on games get to waste money and support the game for the rest of us, while those of us who don't want to buy them don't have to as they don't really provide much of an advantage anyway
The issue there though, is how do children, especially young children have access to paying at that age
Call me old fashioned (at the ripe old age of 18) but I don't think children need debit/credit cards until mid teens
And if a parent just simply let's their kid buy whatever they want without checking, then that's more bad parenting than the fault of anyone else
Why should games companies be forced to change to accomplish something which doesn't harm them and is primarily a result of the actions of the parents
Parents are the ones who are being negatively impacted by loot boxes, so surely they should be the ones to change their practices, especially since it is quite easy for them and solves a whole host of potential other issues
and they aren't going to be able to get them in great number without either parental supervision or access to a parent's credit cars are they
Unless people just leave £50 notes lying around, but that's just asking for it
Actually I would argue that that logic does hold up for alcohol
As I've been elaborating on elsewhere in the thread, for children under the working age (which I think is 14 for part time work and 16 for full work here ) they are forced to rely on money from their parents or other family members, in that sense it is easy to control whether or not they consume alcohol
At the age they can start working, surely if they are nature enough to work, then they are mature enough to drink and if not then surely the working age should be raised until they are mature enough to make sensible decisions
Phew that was a hot take
How does ones area of living affect ones ability to pickpocket
And furthermore, how does that statement even actually help your point at all
And having access to that shop doesn't make a jot of difference if they don't have the capability to pay, ie parental consent and funding
Wait wait, so kids spending the what £5 they earn from a paper round, on a game they enjoy is bad all of a sudden
There is a clear difference between spending £5 the child has sent themselves and spending £1,000 off of mum's card without her consent, that's patently obvious
For Wales the closest “brother” countries would maybe be Scotland and Ireland, though they seem a lot closer to each other than Wales
The closer regions in terms of language, history and culture are Cornwall and Brittany, Brittany is a bit less of a brother since they are French & Celtic but Cornwall is a good candidate for brother
There’s also a community in Patagonia in Argentina that’s speaks Welsh, these could be considered pretty close too
I'd probably have to say England, they are kind of like an annoying younger brother who thinks they are always right and keeps stealing stuff from us
Wouldn’t change a thing really
I believe there is no one definition for how the dragon should appear on the flag - so all red dragons on a white and green even background are technically valid Welsh flags
I would like to see more of the [flag of St David] but I wouldn’t like it to replace the current one
Also, [Glyndŵr’s flag] is pretty cool, though it’s almost exclusively used as a symbol for independence movements, so wouldn’t be able to represent all of Wales
I would give NI back to Ireland and remove st patrick's satire, restoring the flag of the Kingdom of Great Britain
As it should be :)
I quite like that, I always thought it would clash of it was incorporated but it seems good there
There is a growing independence/unhappiness here with the way Wales is ruled so there may be an attempt to ‘placate’ Wales with representation on the flag, I’m not sure if it’ll make a huge difference though, more devolution does seem somewhat inevitable even if the current U.K. government is very anti-devolution
As much as it would be class to have a dragon on the Union Jack, it’s probably not there for a reason and that reason being it doesn’t look right on the Union Jack, the Union Jack is a brilliant flag and I don’t really think it needs improvement, especially with a dragon on it
It’s because Wales was forcibly annexed by England into the Kingdom of England
Then when Scotland joined with the Act of Union it was just England + Scotland, then they added Ireland in later
At the time of the Union Flags inception Wales wasn’t considered separate to England, with the hope that it would somewhat lose its identity like other Celtic areas did, to different degrees (Cumbria, then Cornwall and the Isle of Man)
We have the puffins on Puffin Island
And various stories of sleeping dragons across Wales
Maybe not so well known now, but The Swansea Jack's death was reported nationally when he died
In Swansea there was a pub named after him, and there are statues .
Basically a dog who rescued drowning people, 29
Not a lot of people hear Welsh a lot, so the descriptions vary a lot
I’ve had it sounds Arabic, Icelandic, Elvish, sing-songy, impossible you pronounce
Some people say it sounds ‘stupid’ when they hear words like “teledu” for television or “mathemateg” for mathematics
Usually from English only speakers though
A lot pf people say that Welsh is basically Elvish (Sindarin), and probably even harder to speak correctly but seeing as Tolkien based Sindarin from Welsh and aome other languages, I'd say this is a fairly accurate assumption
The neighbours usuallynlaigh at it and say its dead/pointless/irrelevant
Not to sure what people further afield think of it
I believe Tolkien based most of his Elvish on a combination of Welsh and Icelandic but that’s doesn’t mean he never looked at Irish
Welsh similarly has a lot of vowels (2 more than English), but because they are w and y a lot of people see Welsh as having no vowels in words like ‘gwyl’ and ‘cwmystwyth
My favourite is when they laugh at the word for ambulance, which is “ambiwlans”, and then I ask what the English for ambulance is, and they still don’t see the hypocrisy
It’s literally just a French word
The th sounds are also in Welsh, the voiced and unvoiced sounds are written th and dd respectively

Jon mêd his wê tw a tafern thrw ddy darc fforest, onli tw ffaind awt ddat hi fforgot ddy mynu
I find it interesting how j gets changed to dj or dz in most languages
In Welsh:
Aeth Ioan ar ei ffordd i'r dafarn trwy'r coedwig dywyll, ond i gofio wnaeth ei anghofio ei arian
Should be something like this
I'm currently learning and from the South, but could this also be accurate
"Jon meid hys wei tw ei tafern thrw ddu darc fforest ownli tw ffaind awt ddat hi fforgot ddu mhni
We tend to flatten "ai" to "ê", like parêd yn lle parade
Whether the gov should give free food to children who live in poverty so they can eat during the holidays, the gov says no, and the press says yes

You can't say women anymore, it's " people who have periods"
For the UK as a whole, it would definitely be Cambridge and Oxford
For wales however
Cardiff University has become the top University in Wales, I would say this is then followed by Bangor and Aberystwyth University
We also have a lot colleges as well, which are pretty good
It’s weird, I go to a “red brick” uni
And some friends from school went to other ones
Even when they have a lot of history and a good reputation, doesn’t mean the education they provide isn’t occasionally sub par
I think Liverpool dropped lower than the other unis in Liverpool in many rankings recently, and the number of poorly taught lectures courses and modules I’ve had is too high
The lecturers are incredibly clever and very much near the top of their field, but that doesn’t translate to them being good at teaching
It just feels to me that sometimes these universities just try to take advantage of the fact that their reputation is so high and not make sure they are actually providing a top class course
Yeah I agree that the ranking systems and such aren’t great either, was just an observation
I had a friend at Uni of and one at John Moores and they just used the ranking thing as banter
I think with less prestigious unis there’s a lot more scope for teaching since that’s sometimes entirely what the university is for
Like you’ve said, staff at Russell group unis are required or expected to produce a lot of top class research and teach to a high standard
Wales is less corrupt than full UK parliment, partly cuz we have no money to steal from our economy anyway

Slightly off topic, but I have to say the Andalusia flag is absolutely gorgeous
As other countries have said, we feel a lot closer to famous people
For a capital city, Cardiff has a pretty small city centre
Which means I’ve bumped into a fair few Welsh or local ‘celebs’ over the years
It’s been fairly common for people I know to see filming for things like Doctor Who and Sherlock etc take place in public
This is because we have the BBC studios and such a small city compared to London, so seeing things filmed there might not be so common
If a Welsh story makes it onto the UK wide news, we know it’s a big deal
But the ‘regional’ news is actually the news for the whole of Wales, when in England it’s just a few counties, which shows how small we are
I have seen people I know on the Welsh news on quite a few occasions, just being interviewed as locals etc
I do live in Cardiff, so my experiences might be vastly different to those who live elsewhere in the country
Not all people, I am learning Spanish because I like visiting there, and the areas I visit many people don't speak English, plus you get much more out of the holidays
Although I suppose the good thing about speaking English is you get to choose your 2nd language as you please
Maybe if the US had it's own national language you might feel differently, but when you speak the language from a small island on the edge of Europe , then it's never going to be something you can be proud of as your own
It's complicated
I guess that I identify as Welsh British

Here in Wales, it's the dualling of the [A465 road] particularly through the Clydach Gorge
The current section of work is both [behind schedule and over budget]
For the wider UK, London's [Crossrail] project is the obvious answer
The central tunnel section, station construction and integration of three different signalling systems are proving complex
Originally scheduled to open in December 2018, [it is now projected to open in 2021] Covid-19 may push that date back to 2022
Yeah, I was under the impression that some stations would remain closed once the system had opened
I think the main issue was the Crossrail 'team' not communicating the delays properly to the Mayor etc
The sections outside of the tunnels are running, eg London - Reading and London - Shenfield, which is impressive
I did read that the pandemic situation had 'paused' work though
I want to see it now
Holy shit haha
Looks like my old school ID
To be honest I don't think people are as worried about cornonavirus here than in other countries, I remember people being genuinely scared during the Ebola and Swineflu epidemics but this time its different
Ive played way too much Assasins creed odyssey to know otherwise lol
I went to school with a girl named Chardonnay, and another called Leaf
Leaf’s surname was unfortunate too but I don’t want to ID a random girl on reddit, especially with a unique name like that
Also it wasn’t like Leif the Scandinavian name, but genuinely Leaf as the parents were very hippy-ish
Chardonnay seemed a little tragic and chavvy, Leaf could’ve been a cool name but it didn’t work

Honestly, I think availability of charging points is going to be the biggest deal with electric cars
Not so much the plug standard or 'service provider'.
Tesla in the UK are following the US model for example, by building Superchargers along the motorway network here
Meanwhile most of the locations on Zap Map in rural parts of the UK seems to be at guest houses or stately homes, not really ideal for the average driver IMO
IIRC there is an EU standard for all new high-speed railway lines
They must be built with 1,435mm gauge track (Standard gauge), ETCS Level 2 signalling and 25 kV AC overhead electrification
Going by some common definitions:
Standard Gauge: 1,435mm
Iberian Gauge: 1,668mm
Russian Gauge: 1,520mm
Irish Gauge: 1,600mm
Indian Gauge: 1,676mm
We've got about 7 different types of narrow gauge here in Wales just on [heritage steam railways]
Track gauges
Yes:
Standard Gauge: 1,435mm
Iberian Gauge: 1,668mm
Russian Gauge: 1,520mm
Irish Gauge: 1,600mm
Indian Gauge: 1,676mm
We've got about 7 different types of narrow gauge here in Wales just on [heritage steam railways]
I mean it makes life a lot easier when travelling in countries where you don't speak the local language (like when I went to Hungary for example)
It does make us lazier though
Its not hard to learn a few basic phrases (hello, goodbye, thank you, cheers, one beer please, do you speak English

It depends where you are, but Oliver Cromwell is still reviled by many people more than 300 years later

Its hard to find welsh translations for things, so where possible i like to use that but they are wrong most times, ie, not many games have minor language translations, but sites like Microsoft and Google are more opening
I've seen plenty of comments where Scotland and Ireland are congratulated for "fighting back" against "the evil Brits" who are "oppressing" them (ignoring the fact that Scots ARE British
Meanwhile, somebody types a comment in Welsh
Cue the jokes that they've had a stroke, are summoning Cthulu or had the cat walk over their keyboard
You see similar things where the SNP get 45 seats in an Election and it's like Braveheart 2
0, but when Plaid Cymru gains ONE seat here in Wales and it just gets slagged off as "that stupid Welsh independence party" or similar
Sheep
Even though NZ has more
> Having a weird-ass language
We get that here in Wales
To the point that major brands think [this sort of thing] is a good idea
Even in 2020
That's pretty solid assessment
In fairness to Denmark its not as if it was considered to be the premier armed fighting force on land that France was considered to be
Poor Denmark could never have been expected to fight against nazi germany
Not in any way tbh
Back then France was considered by many people to  posses the most powerful military on the mainland continent
The perceived wisdom was that Germany would get curbstomped by the French
Obviously history didn't play out that way
The irony here is I once had a joke book about different nations and all the Sheep shagging jokes were about Scottish people, IIRC it was Aberdeen that was the target of abuse
My issue here isn't the number of seats, more how the sort of people who cheer on the SNP then dump on Plaid
I mean, both parties have the same aims, that sort of thing
Thanks
Nah, we've been getting this shit *long* before Brexit
I'm not sure where everything fits in with the Picts and various Celts, but I'd say us Welsh have been around almost as long
Bear in mind the demonym "Welsh" derives from an Anglo-Saxon word, *Wealh*, meaning "others"...
We've been on the receiving end of this shit for decades, long before people complained that everything was "too PC".
Schools were practically [*beating* the Welsh language out of children as recently as the 1940s]
When we try and defend our culture, we get told we're "overreacting", that it was just "a joke". Except that's what they said the last time, and the time before that
and well, *every* time this happens
Ha, no worries
Is that just because Aberdeen is quite northern
"Barod neu ddim, mae'r helwr yn dod
Ready or not, the Hunter's coming
"Yn barod neu ddim rwyn dod" ready or not, coming
Quite simple yet effective
barod neu beidio yma Dwi'n dod
barod ai peidio, dyma fi'n dod
Both, welsh is a fucked language, the south are more formal in the way they speak it so like me for instance i will speak closer to the type they use on google translate, national news and language learning programs, the north have a more informal and older way of speaking, because the english almost irradiated welsh from the south so they brought it back
It also has the same construct as older arabic old hebrew and irish
I mean I've never encountered a Welsh speaking Patagonian but I'm sure that there would be a few differences
Englands (general) arrogance
You hear it a lot, especially when the football is on, they love to shit on other countries
A lot of the time is banter which is fine, but sometimes it does seem to cross into the territory of malice
The English based press are the worst offenders for this
It's an outlet, I do think a lot of that has to do with the fact that being English is treated as a bit of a dirty thing
Unlike Welsh patriotism or even Scottish patriotism, English patriotism only seams to get an outlet during sporting events
At any other time they rightly or wrongly get accused of being a nutty EDL type
So I do feel bad for the English at times
Especially when it comes to acts of patriotism
We don't hate England
England is like our annoying older cousin, we don't always see eye to eye but ultimately we're still family
>Why the rest of the UK seem to hate us but we like them
Definitely not true, and I say this as a Welshman who has lived in England for 20 years
I love England, its a beautiful country, not quite as beautiful as Wales but beautiful never the less
Honestly I think some of this "hate" is manufactured by the media, and the gobby sods on social media that spout it off are just a loud vocal minority
Yes, a lot of that comes down to the UK = England attitude that many in the media and politics have
English people are supposed to be proud to be British as a replacement, meanwhile in W and S British identity supplements the local identity (if we identify as British that is)
> 400 Englishmen telling you "that's just our our sense of humor"
See also: any 'joke' about the Welsh language
Anything less than winning Euros/ World Cups is failure for a lot of them and particularly for the press
I mean to be fair to them they never said exactly when it's coming home, could be next year, could be in 100 years
>Booing whenever an english coach or player is on the big screen
I mean England's rugby coach did call Wales a "shit little place", saying things like that doesn't tend to go down well with the people that live there no matter where they are
I've been in pubs in Wales with the rugby on with English, Irish, Australian, Scottish, French, Italian, Kiwi, South African etc fans and its never been anything other than a friendly atmosphere
I've been in pubs in England quietly watching a rugby game in my Wales top and been angrily shouted at by English fans many times
I'm sure there are dickheads from Wales, Scotland and Ireland that also get gobby when the rugby is on, but it seems far more institutionalised in England
For a country that loves to dish out 'banter' they do tend to get a tad touchy
My mum's English, I was born in England, support an English football team and I went to an English university
I do not hate England
Criticism =/= hate
Theres a lot to love about England but there are also things to criticise
A lot of the time when Welsh/ Scottish/ Irish people criticise England we are criticising the political establishment (ie Westminster, the UK media etc) not the English as a people
I'm not saying that it doesn't happen in Wales too on occasion
However, it does seem that for many in England the instinctive reaction to victory (or defeat for that matter) is to stuck up the magic v's to the opposition
The only times I've heard of/ seen something similar happen here is between Cardiff and Swansea fans, its far more common (in my experience) to just shake the other lots hand and have a drink with them
I've seen that happen in England too, but almost never when international games are concerned
I think England is a lovely place full of amazing people but because of people like Boris Johnson, they always get a bad reputation
We judge them for the actions of others and think nothing of it
This thread has made me realise that I’ve heard a lot of bad things said about England but not Scotland, Wales or NI
It’s not fair
Sorry to all the English people
From the UK, of the top of my head I can think:

Tippex - Correction Fluid

Crossing while clear is socially accepted, even encouraged here
It just seems so to my mind to wait if there is no reason not to cross
You should've told her Europeans celebrate it on April 7th because we write dates the other way round
Not sure if we have one for cities and countryisde, but the people of north Wales call those in south Wales Hwnts, and the people of south Wales refer to the north Welsh as Gogs
Hwnts derives from Hwntu which means yonder/over there, Gogs is the shortened version of Gogledd meaning North
Come to think about it, "forgotten about" may be used
A guy I know was in Greece (I think) in a touristy hotspot
There were lots of people outside restaurants trying to get people in, shouting in English, German etc
A common thing Welsh people will do is just reply in Welsh until they stop because they don’t know the language at all, and assume you don’t know any that they’re speaking
I’ve done this to avoid street sellers and pushy restaurant staff a lot
So this guy and his wife do that, “Shwmae
” and just start speaking Welsh to the waiter, only for him to reply in Welsh
Turns out he was married to a Welsh woman and they ran the restaurant together
They ended up all eating there together and had a great time
If you consider the England to Wales to Scotland travellers this happens incredibly regularly
I go to university in England but grew up and live in Wales when not at uni
My dad travels to England for work everyday
It’s similar with Scotland
It’s slightly less common to travel to “the mainland”, but if someone says they are going to France next week it’s really normal
I went to Spain in November to see a friend and the return flight was £20, literally cheaper than the train back to Wales from university
Many people work in Europe, my uncle used to travel to Brussels once every few weeks for work
There’s a few in English from Welsh which is the uncommon way around
It’s hard to say which words are from Welsh or whether they share a common Brythonic ancestor
Penguin, is thought to have come from pen-gwyn, meaning white head, and pronounced the same
Corgi, the dog breed, is from the Welsh cor meaning dwarf and ci meaning dog, so dwarf dog
Potentially the word flannel, from gwlanen meaning “flannel wool” apparently
These next lot are a lot more speculative, but still interesting
Adder, from Welsh neidr, which is just snake I believe
Potentially crockery, from crochan
Crumpet, from crempog
Gull is from Welsh or Cornish, gwylan or guilan
Iron, from hearn
[Here’s] a longer list
I just tried to choose the most interesting and most common words
Edit: Penguin should be in the more speculative section
Ever have a "Mufti" (non-uniform / "own clothes") day in school
The word ["Mufti"] has it's origins in Islamic culture, and also seems to date back to the days of the British Empire in India
Hardly any from Welsh, although corgi means dwarf dog in Welsh
I’m sure ‘dad’ comes from the Welsh ‘tad’ as opposed to father, which would’ve been the original English word
Hadn't thought of that, good point
This doesn't work as a UK question
The 2nd language of Scotland is Scots, of Wales is Welsh, of  Ireland is Irish and of England os Polish
High-school IT techie (working in England)
Your comments echo things my teaching colleagues have said
Its everywhere here it's so prevalent that if I wanted to I could get a hook up in my home village in the Welsh marches if I where so enclined and once you manage to reach the large towns and cities you can get it within ten minutes
Most people I know from their mid 50s to late teen use it, in fact I'm seen as the odd one out for not touching it tbh
It's not just Wales though, I'm told my experience is UK wide
There are potheads all over the country
Sounds like a simular situation to Wales and the UK as a whole tbh
Its incredibly easy to get ahold of
Even during lockdown supprisingly
Sounds familiar,  I'm in my mid 30s most of my mates who are in their late 20s and early 30s smoke it, they have since their teens and even a few of their parents, who are in their mid 50s and are old school ravers puff it
Its fairly widespread in my experience even in the sleepy shires of England and over the border in quiet Welsh villages
Its fairly commonplace in my experience
Yep, even in my small village of <1,000 people it’s easy enough to find
I think I only know of two people who are dead set against it at my age, 20s, and then maybe a few more older people are too
My dad is fairly against it but I think that’s because of him being from NI
My mum used to smoke when she was younger
It would make so much money if it was legalised
Would be safer too I suppose
I was in the crackdown camp many years ago but now I really do think we need to legalise and control the market instead
If it where regulated like alcohol or tobbaco then I think we could reduce future cases of mental health issues arising
As it is at the mo, its the fucking wild west out there
No one is in control
Yeah, or just let people get plants for themselves so they don’t have to give money and control to potentially dangerous and exploitative gangs in order to get hold of it
The majority of people who smoke it have a good relationship with it
Those that are addicted would be able to get better help, with the money from legalisation adding to mental health and addiction services
I don’t see a single negative personally, I don’t even think the numbers of users would change drastically
If it wasn't for the flags next to people's usernames I'd bot be able to tell I was talking to non native speakers a lot of the time
*Rheilffordd*, meaning "railway". I don't think there are other terms in Welsh
Yes, cant remember the exact amount but i think about ⅓ of our country is national parks and the rest is small towns and villages, the further to the middle you go the less people there are
There’s no untouched land in Wales, but if you go into some of the mountains, and off a trail, you might be able to go a day or two without seeing someone, especially if you managed to find a wooded area
While there’s a low population density in parts of Wales, there are a lot of lanes and farms and walking trails, so eventually someone will pass by, but it is still wonderful countryside
That reminds me, a while back I found out that *London alone* has more population than Wales and Scotland combined
(Plus about half of Northern Ireland, if I'm remembering the numbers right
) It always kinda breaks my brain a little
Northern islands are probably your best bet for that kind of thing, yeah
A Google search suggests the IoM has almost exactly the same population density as Wales
(Roughly 146-149 people per square kilometre)
Not at all
Head of State is an inherited title so we don't get a say anyway
Our current head of Government was born in the US and its almost never a topic of discussion
Edit: We've had Prime Ministers born in Canada (while it was a UK colony), the US and Ireland (While it was an English client state)
Lucky French
The media and politicians are in practically in bed with eachother in most places
Ireland, or possibly Scotland
Either way it was a mutual dislike of the English invading our lands
What about the Anglo-Spanish war
There were  claimants to the portugese throne on both sides, however the ruler at the time (and Portugal with him)  were on the Spanish side
No, but Primark in the UK always has piles of t-shirts with a seemingly random American city or state name on the front
Yes, normally they have things like "police" or "security" on them and they just look weird so I ignore them
I've had similar conversations with friends and relatives, yeah
Not looked in H&M, I know they do some men's stuff, I've just never been in one
Oh, rhinestones are cool again
Honestly it feels like Primark just make t-shirts with any old place on, for £4 who cares if it's thrown out in 6 months, right
Yeah that sounds like a lot of the t-shirts Primark have
If you took all the text off the picture would be quite nice
It's not popular anymore
Still seems big with the teens at the school I work at
Yes but increasingly they're 'local' versions for London etc
After the bombing at the Ariana Grande convert a few years ago there were a lot of I ️ MCR shirts (Manchester
I'm glad I don't, because that's just annoyed me seeing that
Authentic what
though
Hah, fair enough
They have their place, I've got some cheap jeans and t-shirts from them
Their underwear (boxer shorts) is pretty good too
For slobbing in the garden, mowing the lawn, £10 jeans are fine
A few of em still have superdry backpacks, but that's about it
I don't exactly "interact" with them (unless they need a computer password changing or something), but sometimes you're stuck on the corridors at lesson changes
If you can, just for the laugh really
Ha, cheers
Yeah that looks like a Primark one alright
Mainly UK (especially Wales) and Ireland
Outside of us I keep an eye on my family & friends politics towards elections and if something big happens (Germany, Poland, Spain & Netherlands)
What is the scariest place in your country
I am posting this at 5 am because why not
we invented it
We all remember when we were 14, drinking crofters cider in the local park
Me and my dad both renewed our season tickets with the rugby team we follow despite the league not going ahead this year
Traditionally, a chosen first name then (optionally) ap/ ferch (son of/ daughter of) and then father's first name, so a child of Rhys called Dafydd would be Dafydd (ap) Rhys
It was not uncommon for this to extend to multiple generations, so names like Dafydd ap Rhys ap Llywelyn ap Tomos ap Gruffudd (Dafydd son of Rhys, son of Llywelyn, son of Tomos, son of Gruffydd) did exist
This changed once the English custom of fixed surnames became favoured by the nobility in Wales
In many parts of Wales Welsh people began to adopt an anglicised versions of Welsh names, which is why so many people in Wales are called Jones, Williams, Davies or Price, as there is only a limited selection of anglicised Welsh surnames
In more modern times its the chosen first name, an (optional) middle name then a surname, usually the father's but sometimes double barrelled or hybrid between the father's and mother's
Probably a farmer or dead as without glasses I’m not sure I would’ve been able to see anything important
I know they are older but I doubt I’d have had good access to them
Merthyr Tydfil, he works in the local chippy with Elvis
Ooh I love seeing the use of ‘quare’ in the wild
Makes me think of my Granda though lol
I’d rather be thought of as Scottish or Irish, usually abroad people think Wales is part of England
Seems like we can’t convince the world otherwise so can we perhaps maybe just convince them we are part of the Scot-Ireland conglomeration that people seem to have decided exists
Probably the collapse of a digital learning system in Torfaen and Monmouthshire - the two councils left ~10,000 laptops [in storage for several years]
Not so much a national embarrassment, but in 2015 I went into a housing association call centre where they used systems that were coded before 1982
They managed around 50,000 homes on systems that only used monochrome monitors
Fair point
I suspect they were very likely outdated by the time they did see use, though
Microsoft [are actually housing server farms underwater] just so you know
Oh yeah in Welsh we have 'echddoe' for the day before yesterday and 'trannoeth' for the day after tomorrow
[Brynmawr Rubber Factory] certainly is interesting
I’m not sure what it’s history was, doubt it was built to be architecturally remarkable
Yes
Not sure why, I think it might be to prevent ignorance based racism maybe
I did a GCSE in it
We were taught about different issues and different religion's stances on them
It was actually really helpful in forming my own views on various issues
Tell him that the reason the Dutch are so tall is that historically all the short ones drowned so it’s customary to cross yourself and bless a glass of water before drinking it, in memory of the drowned
How did it go
Yes
Hahaha, thanks for answering
[St David's] just to screw with people
If practical considerations weren't an issue I'd go with Machynlleth or Caernarfon for historical reasons
Taking practical considerations into account Swansea is the only alternative really (maybe Newport too but that would be incrediblydepressing)
Eupen, then both the French speakers and Flemish speakers can unite in their disappointment and everybody loses equally as much
Based on the high school I attended in the 1990s:
I think we had to be on site from 8:30 - 8:40 or so
Registration was at 8:50 and lesson 1 started at 8:55
We had a 15 minute breaktime at 10:30
Lunchtime was from 12:00 to 12:50 and then there was a 5 minute registration session for the afternoon
Afternoon lessons were from 12:55 to 15:15
We had 9x 35-minute lessons a day, although most of those were 'double' lessons
The few times we had classes as single 35-minute lessons they were either language lessons (so German, French or Welsh), or more 'general' things like assemblies
We also had one 'tutor' period a week, where we're just with our form class for that lesson
We didn't get taught much then, it was a chance to catch up on homework and speak to your form tutor if you had any worries bout anything
Annoyingly, PE was also a single lesson (we also had a double 'Games' lesson once a week for team sports)
That’s the most Polish thing I’ve ever read
Thank you
> Socks and sandals
The 100% surefire way to spot Germans in the wild
[Canadian]
Probably the national parks like Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons
In terms of towns and cities I'd say Llandudno for North Wales
Not sure for South Wales but I'd guess at Cardiff maybe
Yeah
As soon as the whole pandemic and lock down eases I should look at going up Snowdon
Maybe next year now
One big difference is that the US states have stayed much the same since they were founded
Counties in the UK, particularly in England and Wales, have been through a restructuring of Local Government maybe 2 or 3 times since 1974, with several counties either merging and splitting during that time
It's only really an issue where some companies are using old postal address databases, and even then if the post code's right the mail usually gets to you OK
I always get mixed up with all the counties in the South Wales Valleys
No clue on Scotland, NI or London Boroughs but I've probably heard of most of them over the years
I didn't find German too bad, definitely easier than French
Welsh is the only other language I had to learn at school and I'd say that was the hardest of the 3 but not by too much
I imagine something like Russian, Arabic or Japanese is much harder but I've never attempted to learn those so I can't really comment on them
Yes
Wish we weren't leaving
Strange that the 1st non EU country I'll ever go to will be my own
Same
Feels weird
Not yet unfortunately
Would love to go someday, few friends of mine lived in Bergen and I've met a handful of Norwegians through the years but never been to Scandinavia let alone Norway
Its definitely on the bucket list
The anti-vaxx stuff basically started in the UK ~30 years ago with Andrew Wakefield
The conspiracies I see at the moment are Flat Earthers, and people who think 5G is going to immediately give us all cancer or something
Aye, that's a fair point
I still think of Wakefield as being responsible for the increase in anti-vaxxers since the 1990s.
> I don't know the translation of every plant or animal name
Ah, that's why you should always talk about fauna and flora in their Latin scientific names
It was a joke mate
Yeah, the tap water in Wales is safe to drink - and we pump some of it to Liverpool and Birmingham so you're probably OK to drink the water there, too
2nd home ownership
In a lot of rural coastal areas in West and North West Wales lots of houses in towns and villages are now owned by 2nd home owners (very often English)
This means that there is a big shortage of homes available for local people, especially younger people and for most of the year (winter especially) the towns are almost ghost towns
Also during the current crisis people have been travelling from the big cities in England to their second homes in Wales at night to avoid the police
Poznań is the first one that doesn't sound familiar, though there are plenty below it that do
Listen to the radio while driving and there are some good apps out there to learn the Welsh Language
I've always equated Finnish with someone trying to speak English after having a stroke
Yes most schools in Wales is now taught welsh as a secondary language
It depends really
Some people stopped once they finished school
I believe it was taught until the Welsh Not period started
Now it is picking up with speed again which is amazing
Roughly 1/3 of Wales can speak Welsh
Swansea and Cardiff are very low, perhaps 5% honestly (I live in both cities)
I learnt welsh for the first 16 years of my life, got a B in it at GCSE, then stopped and now I can’t even speak a sentence
It’s taught awfully here (I didn’t deserve a U grade let alone a B)
I dont live in the cities to be honest
But every time I've been to the two cities I have heard welsh being spoken
Most people where I live speak Welsh to each other
I think most people that you hear speaking Welsh in Cardiff/ Swansea/ Newport moved over from Carmarthenshire
Very few people that grew up here in the S/ SE can speak anything beyond very basic Welsh, unless they were lucky enough to go to a Welsh language school
Well theres no v, j, x or k in the Welsh alphabet so probably not
Well the Principal Area of Gwynedd has the highest percentage of its inhabitants able to speak Welsh and towns there include Bangor, Bala, Fairbourne, Harlech, Bethesda and Barmouth
All of which I don't think are too difficult to pronounce/ spell
Dont forget the whole thing about the pronunciation of ng, ll, dd, ff, ch, ph, th and rh
Because we live on an island, most Brits feel excluded (sort of)
We sometimes feel like the middle child of Europe, not forgotten but not as close to everyone
It’s really heartwarming to read all of these comments saying “togetherness” though
>If you leave the door open - were you born in a barn
My mum would say she's not heating the street if the front door was left open
There are two ceremonial 'offices' in the British Parliament that only exist because backbench MPs [cannot actually resign] instead they have to voluntarily disqualify themselves from sitting in Parliament
Yes:
[And Hereford]
Obviously all of these examples would break the law nowadays, at the least you'd probably be on a manslaughter charge if you tried it
Plus, if you're from North East Wales like me (Wrexham / Flintshire way), well we don't really have Welsh accents either
Welsh is completely phonetic and has two extra vowels then English
Meaning, Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch is easy to pronounce
Tŷ Bach - “little house” is probably the most common way of saying toilet here, especially in the south
Tŷ bach (small house), and lle chwech (six place
I don't really understand this one tbh)
Gestures broadly at entire language
For real though:
LlanfairPG, Chwyrligwgan
We have an absolute classic in Wales which is our longest placename: llanfairpwllgwyngylchgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
(And yes, those are four 'L's in a row that you are seeing there)
Squirrel seems to test people
When I found out Godmanchester was pronounced “Gumster” I just gave up
And English people say Welsh is hard to pronounce, least you just have to read the letters lol
Just some I can think of off the top of my head
Boi - means boy but around here at least people use it like “shwti boi” like “how’s it going mate”
Achan - apparently comes from “bachgen” meaningful boy so usually with male friends
I guess there butt and mun in South Wales but I don’t really know them
(Sorry I’ve only got two)
Wales has more castles per square mile than any other country in the world
I guess suspicion of poaching
Don't people in Europe just flash a card at a machine these days
I live right next to a small town with loads of Roman ruins
Theres Roman baths, Roman barracks, [an Amphitheatre] and they recently discovered a Roman port too
My school was next to the barracks and Amphitheatre so at luch time me and my friends used to eat on the Amphitheatre (once we were old enough that they let us out at lunchtime)
Wales has a couple dotted around the place, most of the significant ones seem to be in the South-East
Including the town of Caerleon near Newport that has a fairly extensive amphitheatre and bathhouse, interestingly enough Caerleon was reputed to be the location of King Arthur's capital: Camelot, although there are many places that claim to be the location of Camelot
It has to be either the remix of the traditional song 'sosban fach' in English 'little saucepan'  for honestly juat being a pure belter
Every Welsh language disco/school disco had this utter belter in it
Yeah, it's just an "Ireland" team in the 6N, NI and Ireland together
The other half are at an F1 race somewhere in the world, cheering on Max Verstappen
I know of it happening once near here
They had cctv footage and they posted it on the local Facebook group saying “We know who you are, please return our parcel by the end of the day, or we will contact the police”, and that did the trick
The delivery driver had hidden it but the person who stole it watched him hide it from across the road
Toulon
Went there for a summer holiday on the cheap a long while back and discovered why it was so cheap
Pretty sure they filmed any french film that needed to show a shithole in Toulon
Nothing but concrete, fumes, graffiti and monstrous apartment blocks from the 60s and the ghetto
My only memories from 4 days there are buying a dictionary as nowhere had a phrasebook, getting sunburn on the tops of my feet and persuading my girlfriend at the time to go topless on the beach
Bielefeld
Sounds a lot like what I've seen of Telford
Like the rest of the UK it costs about £9,000/year for us to go to uni
If you are an international student outside the EU it goes up to about £19,000/year
Before 2010 it was x3 cheaper but the government coalition bumped them up which is a shame as I started uni in 2012
Knowing that uni is free or cheap in other European countries is mind-boggling
Water, we got tons of the stuff
Good job the English own most of the reservoirs and pipe it to England so we see little of the money
Healthcare
I have the Unlimited plan from Three
Managed to get a MoneySavingExpert deal for £16 a month for 12 months
Nah I can assure you they're cheaper here
Love them
I'm the weirdo who will sometimes go outside in them for brief moments just so I can marvel at them
As long as I'm indoors
Yeah
I do, I dunno why but a thunderstorm at night with a bit of rain afterwards is oddly soothing to hear if you are inside and in bed
We have some good animal names:
Buwch Goch Gota --> Little Red Cow (Ladybird)
Mochyn Daear --> Earth Pig (hedgehog)
Bochdew --> fat cheeks (Hamster)
Mochyn Cwta --> Shirt Pig (guinea pig)
Siani flewog --> furry "Jenny" (Caterpillar)
Draenog --> thorny (Hedgehog)
Llygoden Fawr --> Big mouse (rat)
There's tons more but I can't think of any others other than animals so here's some idioms
Rhoi'r ffidl yn y to --> put the fiddle in the roof (give up)
Llyncu Mul --> swallow a donkey (to sulk)
Mae'n bwrw hen wragedd a ffyn --> it's raining old ladies and sticks[like a walking stick] (it's raining cats and dogs
"Hwyl fawr (hoil va-wuh) " is used to say goodbye but literally translates to "big fun".
You’d think welsh, being old brittonic/being so intertwined with english wouldn’t be like this
but;
Buwch Goch Gota (ladybird/ladybug) = “Short red cow”
Bochdew (Hamster) = “Fat cheeks”
Dant y llew (Dandelion) = “Lion’s Tooth”
Drewgi (Skunk) = “Smelly dog”
Gwas y neidor (dragonfly) = “Snake’s servant”
Tŷ bach (toilet) = “Little house”
Pysgod Wibli Wobli (jellyfish) =“Wibbly Wobbly fish”
Popty Ping (Microwave) = “The oven that goes ping” or “ping-oven”
How I would say it (semi fluent Welsh)
Helo, fy enw i ydy John, mae'n bleser i weld ti
lle wyt ti'n dod o?
Hello, my name is John
It's a pleasure to see you
Where do you come from
Your Welsh is fine but I'd usually say "mae'n bleser I weld chi" with strangers
same age strangers = generally chi
Friends, family and people you know well = ti
Talking to teachers or people with authority = chi
Anyone older than you, unless you're friends = chi
Some people, especially older people, might get offended but if you're a learner I doubt they'd care
If you're fluent and address as ti they might take it as a sign of disrespect
I don't really know
I think it's quite similar to Tu / Vous in French
Cows generally leave people be, unless they have a dog
Wild boar in the forest of Dean could be dangerous
Holey, anyway
> The EU flag is something that occasionally pops up on construction site tables telling you this site was partly funded by the EU
But no one would bother flying this flag for any occasion whatsoever
Pretty much the same here, in my experience, and I expect even that is on its way out now

Twin town
[Les Convoyeurs Attendant] for Belgium
Hedd Wyn
I believe it's on YouTube with English subtitles
Hedd Wyn for Wales
Great film that shows Welsh culture prior to ww1 and the tragic story of the pacifict bard forced into war
What ya waiting for
Ze Germans
Was going to put this myself
As far as I know it’s on YouTube too
That's a TV series ain't it
We got it over here as a TV series anyhow
Yes
Filth is fucking fantastic
It had me in fits of laughter all the way through the film tbh
"You're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece
Apparently the best thing to do is cut up a corpse into six pieces and pile it all together
" And when you got your six pieces, you gotta get rid of them, because it's no good leaving it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, now is it
Then I hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs
You got to starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped-up body will look like curry to a pisshead
You gotta shave the heads of your victims, and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggies' digestion
You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don't want to go sievin' through pig shit, now do you
They will go through bone like butter
You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm
They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes
That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute
Hence the expression, "as greedy as a pig"."
Worst I can think of from wales is Welsh rarebit, which is basically cheese on toast with mustard, but that’s more based on the controversy of mustard haha
Also I make mine vegan which almost everybody seems to think is disgusting for some reason haw
Not breakfast, but perfectly justifiable for second breakfast
There are no deep coal mines left and the steelworks are clinging on with a couple of thousand workers
It's hard to explain what people do for a living now
A Welsh man created the National Health Service so everyone can see a doctor for free
There's a Welsh Senedd in Cardiff (which became the capital city)
There's a Welsh language TV station (that's like radio with pictures)
We're still part of the UK unlike most of Ireland
I mean you won't get beaten for speaking Welsh anymore so that's nice
"Going to Cardiff
Your horse is probably quicker than the train"
Cycling still the most convenient way to get around but the roads have more potholes
I think it's [Cwm] (roughly pronounced 'coom')
We have a lot of 3-letter place names like Van and Wig
We also have places named Cwm (also known as corrie) everywhere, but my favourite would be Tŵr in Anglesey, the same island on which Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch lies
Box, in Carmarthenshire
Cil, in Montgomeryshire
Cog, in Glamorgan
Cwm, virtually everywhere
Ely, in Glamorgan
Ham, in Glamorgan
Hem, in Montgomeryshire
Lon, in Merioneth
Pit, in Monmouthshire
Ton, in Monmouthshire
Twr, in Anglesey
Usk, in Monmouthshire
Van, in Montgomeryshire
Van, in Glamorgan
Wig, in Montgomeryshire
We have a few towns twinned with French towns for soke reason, my tiny add village is paired with a French one too
Thanks for that
Ely is probably the 'big' one I missed there
My version was Russian spoken backwards, surely Russians should be the drunk ones
Although vinho verde does creep up on you
Yup
Welsh - I tend to stumble over my words and stutter as I did growing up, especially having forgotten such a chunk of it
English - more natural and relaxed so it sounds normal
Spanish (learning it) - More abrupt to match the language style with a lot of "umm" and "errrr" while I try and remember the next parts of the sentence I want to say
I don't know if it's just me but unless around kids or elderly, most people swear in English to the point they don't really have any meaning, and I'm fairly sure it's my native language
I've heard someone say that swearing in English isn't quite as taboo as it used to be but there are still some words that are very taboo and essentially swear words, most of them being slurs
Then again, I am a teenager so maybe it's just not as taboo amongst my age group
I'd say the general sentiment towards Cardiff in Wales is positive
I think it's a great city
I would however say that there is a perception up here in the North of Wales that Cardiff gets most of the investment - sort of like the "London vs the rest of the UK" sentiment
Yeah, fair
My friends and I do look forward to a day down to Cardiff though
I've always had a great time there
I feel it would be remissed not to mention how "Back to Basics" ended, with the death of [Stephen Milligan]
I'd like to thank England for inventing the train, the world wide web, and the game of Rugby Union
I can't blame you, it was raining heavily here at 9pm
Yes, Tim Berners-Lee (an English computer scientist) was one of the key architects of the WWW
He actually worked with [Robert Cailliau] on the system
It seems as if his Belgian colleague's role has rather been forgotten now, sadly
So I'll say thanks to Belgium too
the what now
You're welcome
We generally save the bitching for rugby matches against you these days :P
The train as a mode of transport, yes
The Pacer - **ish**.
Rural lines like my local one would probably have closed if not for the development of the Pacer and the later conversion of [regional trains] to [single-car units] suitable for rural areas
Yeah, that's fair enough
Yeah, I'll make jokes about Pacers all day long, but the one thing I will always defend them for is keeping the rural lines open
If you want to give your kid a traditional Welsh name, there's an ap for that
Cain- the first murderer
Judas-the traitor
Those names are literally synonymous with the crimes committed by historical/mythical figures
Like here in the UK if you referred to someone as Judas you would be implying they had committed some form of betrayal, I assume it's the same in Spain too
Much the same logic as with Hitler and genocide, just different crimes
*Exactly* the same with Welsh
I went to English-medium schools, so it was usually a register of Welsh (you know, the boring things that adults talk about), that nobody in class would have been able to understand
We did learn Welsh from the age of about 5, maybe earlier, but it was slow going in a class of 30
Didn't really pick up until secondary
Thinking back to it, maybe about 30-40% of my teachers could have been native speakers judging by their accents, so it's quite impressive to think back that every teacher I remember was fluent
That is very true, yes
You must however understand that children only devote their brains to a language when it has immediate utility to their lives, and won’t simply adopt it and begin using it through a classroom setting
I had the same experience with Welsh myself
I did also speak a third language at home, and picked it up much more easily because it was useful to my everyday life - children talk about the food they want to eat, the shows they watch on TV, what they do with their friends
In Wales, kids enjoy sweets with English brand names, watch English television and movies, and more than likely speak English with their friends, often even in Welsh-majority areas
Welsh seemed a bit dry to me as a kid, and a significant portion of my early Welsh education was just songs, presumably because they’re easy to memorise through repetition, and to help non-natives get the pronunciation right
Now, of course, I wish my Welsh was better, since it’s a very beautiful language, and in some sense rings through my heart like a native tongue - it’s the sound of home
However, whenever I do speak it, it often gets the response “sorry, I don’t speak Welsh”. It’s absolutely fine if someone doesn’t, but defaulting to English just makes every short exchange quicker as a result
Again, lack of utility discourages use, and in Ireland it’s the same relationship: (practically) nobody who speaks Welsh/Irish fluently doesn’t also speak English
English is, in every practical sense, the language spoken in both countries
It’s not the same as if Austrian children started speaking English and “didn’t seem to want to learn their own language”; their own language in that case would by-and-large be German, and their own languages in the case of Wales and Ireland are English
Nevertheless, of course, there is an *incredibly* strong relationship between Welsh and the Welsh national identity; “*O bydded i’r hen iath barhau
*”. In some respects, that might encourage its use, but if you are not *considered* Welsh, it does not then constitute ‘your’ language
I associated Welsh very strongly with an ugly form of Welsh nationalism as a teenager
Welsh national identity is very absorptive as far as nations go, but enough people tell you you’re one of ‘the English’, even if you’re not, and that association builds quickly
That does not represent the entirety of the Welsh-speaking community, nor Wales, my home, and a place which I love, but it nevertheless left its impression on me in a time where I was coming to revile the rise of all forms of nationalism in the UK
I understand better now that there are qualitative differences between these nationalisms, but I am nevertheless still opposed to the concept
Now in Ireland, this problem is presumably less common, at least in the Republic, but in the end the number of speakers is so few that the other hurdles are far larger
With each of the ones I described, by the time you reach your twenties, you have a job/studying to worry about, and you want to switch your brain off in the evenings and go out on the weekends with your friends
Only the most devoted are going to spend their free time learning Irish, the same is true of Welsh if you don’t already speak it by then
The only caveat is that many jobs do require some level of Welsh, though the incentive to learn it for that reason is dampened by the fact that a native speaker will almost always be more elegance for the job
So, though it is lamentable, I completely understand why people on the island of Ireland don’t learn Irish, even if many may well ‘want’ to
In Wales, I believe the retention in young second language speakers is going up, I assume based on a few changes in teaching practices
Hopefully Ireland can do the same and achieve full bilingualism, because Irish too is a beautiful language
Of course the biggest barrier in both cases is English
People travel from all over the world to these places because they have some English ability
I can guarantee that nobody moves to Ireland because they speak Irish
These pull factors mean that anyone who hasn’t spent their childhoods in either country must either learn an obscure language with a high amount of geographic specificity, or learn/use one of the most widely spoken languages in history
People don’t pick option one
However, on a final more optimistic note, our small town accepted about 20 Syrian refugees c.2016
I would sit in on a few of their Welsh lessons which were held in a community building I would often revise in
When the opportunity to learn something is free, and you are given support, encouragement, and accepted into a community, great things happen, and the most brilliantly rare cultural crossroads can emerge
I think all of them ended up speaking better Welsh than me
Yes, Y Wladfa
There was a film we watched about it in class called ‘Patagonia’, named after the region
Not to be too cruel but i think france would probably smell of garlic and stinky cheese
Add to that the smell of peat and nitrate fertiliser and i think you have nailed the smell of ireland
Dandelion and burdock
Nah
Id say more a apple smell
Especially come late summer early autumn, in counties like Somerset and herefordshire
When I was about five or six I saw a map of Europe and spent a few months convinced that Turkey was "in the bottom-right corner of the world".
Well, I just learned that Dunkirk is not Scottish
Wasn't sure exactly what it was, but I had a vague idea that it blocked radio signals somehow
A girl moved to my school from England around year 4 and I remember her being shocked that Wales wasn’t a separate island, especially since she had crossed over using the Severn bridge
Perhaps it’s fairly common with people from island nations
Oof harsh aha
"Prepare the gangway, gentlemen
That Honda shall make a grand prize for the Admiralty
It depends, if you are in a social situation, say down the pub with ya mates then sure swear all you like
But swearing infront of kids or old people is big no no
Honestly ya best bet would be to just use common sense, if the situation is social one, then sure, if it's a more formal one or one where there are old people and kids then I'd avoid swearing if possible
Generally it isn't that big a deal but as with all things you gotta pick your times carefully
a = and
i = to
o = from
y = the
e = him
What first comes to mind is the word I, meaning to, and a, meaning and
Why, how much do you earn
Wales is officially bilingual
About a quarter of the population claim to be able to speak Welsh (the number varies depending on the source, the most accurate source is the census which was 9 years ago, so possibly out of date)
Pretty much everyone who speaks Welsh as their first language can speak English fluently from a relatively young age
Welsh is compulsory in English medium schools and English is compulsory in Welsh medium schools (although the standard of Welsh in English medium schools is lower than the standard of English at Welsh medium schools)
Those who go to English medium schools have to learn Welsh pretty much from the start of education until the age of 16 but many leave still not being able to speak anything beyond the very basics
All road signs are bilingual and official letters from the Welsh Government/ council are also bilingual
Theres a Welsh language TV channel (S4C) and Welsh language Radio station (BBC Radio Cymru)
Often non Welsh speakers will tune in for football/ rugby that is beind a pay wall for English language commentary but freely available in Welsh
Letters from the NHS are bilingual, too
Also, at large railway stations, the Welsh announcements are made first
Yep, student finance Wales letters too
Basically anything 'official'
Bear in mind that the 'quarter of people' figure is from the [2011 UK Census] so that figure is largely self-reported
If anything, data suggested the number of people who speak Welsh is declining slightly
Generally for the UK I'd say it's pretty much expected that a lot of kids will start walking to school by ages 10 or 11, they'll have been taught road safety by then and are encouraged to walk in groups
Age 10-11 would be the last year of Primary School, and 11-12 the first year of Secondary School
You often hear of kids in London who use public transport, so from age 11 their journey to school could involve catching a bus or train to school several miles away, maybe even changing trains en route
There is a set threshold for when kids can use a school bus:
>All children between 5 and 16 qualify for free school transport if they go to their nearest suitable school and live at least:
> * 2 miles from the school if they’re under 8
> * 3 miles from the school if they’re 8 or older
Don't think I've seen any kids walking alone at that age in the UK - I know I was still being walked to and from school by my Mum, Grandmother or an Aunt at that age
As /u/EmeraldIbis says a lot of kids don't go to town 'alone' until they're 13 or 14, and even then they're often in groups of 2 or 3
Unfortunately a few high-profile murders did rather reinforce the idea that there's a paedophile 'around every corner', for example [Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman]
I’m not even fluent in modern Welsh, but I usually understand writing if I take my time
Looking at old Welsh it’s nearly incomprehensible, until I scrolled down and read how it was written then
The orthography is significantly different, with there being no use of “ll” and “dd” to represent their sounds and with u and w both being represented by u. It was a little clearer after that
It was further confused by the inclusion of snippets of Latin, so I couldn’t start to imply meaning from the sentence because another language I didn’t know was in the middle
Common Brittonic, the pre-cursor to Welsh (and Cumbric, Cornish and Breton), was spoken across Britain
There’s no real written sources to read, but it was likely fairly similar to Old Welsh
Modern Cornish and Breton are very similar to Welsh in vocabulary and sentence structure
Cumbric sadly died out around 200-300 years ago, but in its prime was spoken in the North East of England and Southern Scotland, hence some place names still being Celtic, like Carlisle, which clearly has the prefix Car, which in Welsh is Caer, meaning fort
In Welsh, Carlisle is Caerliwel(ydd), I’ve bracketed the ydd as this more clearly demonstrates the similar part of the name
One major difference between Welsh and Cumbria is the -ydd suffix sometimes present in place names
This is clear too with Derwent, which in Welsh is Derwennydd
A fluent Welsh speaker, who had maybe put a few hours into understanding the evolution of Welsh, would likely be able to converse with a person from around 500AD in most parts of Britain
There would be some difficulty but most of the core vocabulary seems to have been maintained, since a number of nouns are latin based
For example “ffenestr” for window
Huh, a few of those words do look remarkably Welsh, Credo and ym for example are Welsh words, even now aha
Definitely just a coincidence though
Also not fluent but can understand a fair bit of [this lullaby]  in 7th century Cumric, including counting in Welsh and Cumbric
Only one I can remember is me and an English friend were in a supermarket in a non-touristy part of Munich having a weird argument about which beers we should’ve bought and making stupid jokes, the lady in from passed us one of the divider things to put between shopping at the till
Said danke and she said in English I’m English too it’s nice to listen to you guys and we had to try and remember if we’d said anything about her
I’m struggling to find any exact data
I would (half educated) guess:
Now: Cardiff
1900: Cardiff
1800: Swansea or Merthyr
1700: Swansea
Merthyr
1600:...Swansea
Machynlleth
Aberystwyth
Not including the bike
"Cyntaf i'r felin caiff falu" (First to the mill gets the grind) First come first served
"Ar y gweill" (On the (knitting) needles) In progress
"Mae e'n cadw draenog yn ei boced" ("He keeps a hedgehog in his pocket") He is tight with money
"Paid â chodi pais ar ôl piso" (Don't lift your petticoat AFTER pissing) Don't lock the stable door after the horse has bolted
"Mae e'n gwybod hyd ei gyrn" (He knows the length of his horns) He knows his limits
"Cenedl heb iaith yw cenedl heb galon" A nation without a language is a nation without a heart
There is a [Welsh Language Commissioner] - although they are mainly concerned with ensuring that Welsh has equal status alongside English here in Wales
This was [made law in 2011] Welsh Language \(Wales\) Measure 2011/Pages/The-Welsh-Language-\(Wales\)-Measure-2011
aspx), and updated in 2016
I really wish I had a more accessible and affordable way to learn Welsh
Dad's Welsh but I grew up in America so unfortunately never got to learn
Now that I live here I feel obliged to learn
Duolingo and learnwelsh
cymru are great free tools
Learn at your own pace and you can check for local lessons as well
I know what you mean
Mum's side of the family all speak Welsh, but we're up here in the North East which is a much more English speaking area of Wales
It wasn't taught particularly well in school (IMO), certainly when I compare it to French or German lessons
I really should have got into Duolingo when this whole lockdown started though
Yeah Duo is great but I do better in a classroom setting where I can actually have someone tell me how I'm progressing
Hopefully I can find something when this all ends
Wales’ whole coastline is pretty cool
There’s a path around the whole thing so it’s pretty good to walk around and see different beaches
If you are by the coast you are never more than 20 minutes from a very good beach
Near me for example is [southerndown beach] used as “Bad Wolf Bay” in Doctor Who
A little further West from me there are brilliant beaches
[Barafundle bay] [Three Cliffs Bay] and [Tenby] all spring to mind
There are great beaches in the north too but I’ve not had the chance to visit
[Porth Iago] and [Aberdovey] are two I’d like to go to
I think a few people know Wales has good beaches, especially in the U.K., but as far as I’m aware they don’t really have an international reputation
[Rhossili Bay] is another good one on the Gower Peninsula
When I was younger we went to Morfa Bychan / [Black Rock Sands] and [Rhosneigr] for summer holidays, they're good beaches too
Yeah, honestly there’s so many to pick from
I have one 2 minutes from my front door that’s good and nice and quiet, not going to link to that one though lol
I don't blame you
I mean that all depends on how close the door is to the beach in the first place but yes I would not live on the actual beachfront lol
Definitely Cardiff and Swansea for Wales, Capital and second city
Big footballing rivalry too
Abertawe (Swansea) and Caerdydd (Cardiff)
Definitely agree to Manchester-Liverpool if we're talking about the whole UK though
They're very close to each other, they're the 2 biggest cities, and they're quite different despite being kind of similar
I think the rivalry really only got heated with the rise of football hooliganism in the 80s, though
They're our only proper big cities too, anyway xD
Along with Newport, aye
There are [4 dialects of Welsh] 5 if you include the version spoken in Patagonia
In most of Britain, it's generallu easy to tell what town/city someone comes from by the slang they use and the subtle accent they have
A little bit like the Netherlands I suppose, just less drastic
The UK famously does, someone with a good ear can pinpoint a person’s origin within a radius of about 40km I’d say
Never realised that before
If someone asked I just would have said two: De and the Gogs
Yeah, me too
Yeah, I thought it was just separate North Wales and South Wales dialects
Brexit
Welsh Remain voters don't exist, apparently
Or so most of the UK subreddits have been telling me for the past 3 years
THIS
People need to understand Wales as a nation
[A large proportion of Wales (20% or so) were born in England] and generally those English people living in Wales are older (Wales has suffered from a brain drain for generations)
Furthermore, older people generally voted to leave (which the data kind of backs up -  - look at Conwy & Pembrokeshire which are traditional seaside resorts and have a large, older population, and compare that with Gwynedd which has a university town and a much younger, native population) so apparently even though *Wales* voted to leave, it could be a reasonable argument to make that the *Welsh* did not
Yeah, that's a fair point
Too late to do anything about it all now though
I will say that I think the lack of a "Welsh Daily Mail" etc, for want of a better paper, certainly didn't help us as the domestic Welsh media is quite weak compared to Scotland's.
Yes, good point
That doesn't help the overall Brexit argument either
I can see why a lot of Scots are pissed off, particualrly after the result of the Independence referendum in 2014
I can't blame Brexit on just the English when 52% of us voted the same way here in Wales, but I think our weaker regional media really didn't help there either
The penny is 'starting to drop' round my village, but most people are 3 years too late now sadly
I don't think the 20% of English born people really tipped it tbh, I think the 80% of the Welsh were not helped by our media
It didn't really explain the positives of the EU, many people just dismissed the cash we got as building roads to nowhere and all that
Scotland has its own editions of the Daily Mail, Sun etc
We have very little local media and most people will buy a 'British' Sun or Mirror over the Daily Post / Western Mail
So we were getting more of Gove / Farage / BoJo than anyone speaking up for Wales IMO
EDIT: obviously the 80 / 20 % of the population doesn't include the under 18s etc
I personally voted to Remain
For what its worth I think our weaker regional media here in Wales didn't do much to speak up for the benefits of the EU
It's all far too late now mind you
Some of us did, sadly
Unsurprisingly, Welsh
I think it’s offered in schools in Patagonia, specifically in the Yr Wladfa area of Chubut Province (Argentina), and then Wales
Maybe some of the border primary schools
My friend from a village on the border in Gloucester had Eisteddfods, which are very Welsh
But in generally the opportunity to study and ‘learn’ Welsh is predominantly in Wales
We did home economics at my school (about 10 years ago now) it was part of “DT” which is supposed to be design and technology
For one term we did home economics, mostly cooking but also some budgeting stuff, textiles which was sewing and fabrics for one term and then woodworking and digital designing for the other term
Was very useful imo and should’ve had another few hours a week
Kind of
Chepstow is a town directly on the border with England, the entirety of the town centre is on the Welsh side of the river Wye but the suburbs go over the river into the English side
Technically I think they are classed as different villages but they are effectively suburbs of Chepstow
[Knighton] in Powys is similar
Most of the town is in Wales, the border actually cuts through the town slightly so the railway station is actually in England
My favourite example is Chester FC
Their stadium is in a suburb of Chester that's close to the Welsh border
In fact [the pitch is actually on the Welsh side of the border]
Iceland maybe
It's my go to 'border fact' :P
Men of Harlech is pretty anti-English
It's got a fair few different versions, however all but 2 (the zulu one and the woad one) revolve around defeating the barbarian Saxon's in battle
Coming from Wales, where faggots are a type of food,it took me way to long to understand that lyric as a child
[Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch] - apparently the longest place name in Europe
The locals just call it Llanfair or Llanfair PG
The name was lengthened specifically to attract tourism in Victorian times
It translates roughly as "St Mary's Church in the Hollow of the White Hazel near a Rapid Whirlpool and the Church of St
Tysilio near the Red Cave".
Ironically the platforms at the railway station are [too short to comply with social distancing guidelines] so the station is  temporarily closed now
One we might win
Safe to say we win this perticular one
It’s actually 51 letters because “ll” and “ch” are considered single letters in the Welsh language
IIRC there's a fast-flowing part of a river nearby or something
Yes, basically that
I believe the actual reason is an operational one
There isn't enough room to get two sets of [train doors] at either end of the car open, so the Guard can't keep themselves distant from the passengers
I think so, but IIRC they're all on the 'mainland' side of Wales nearer Bangor
I was in the early stages of planning a train tour of some European cities I've not visited as yet
I'd got as far as Hamburg, Berlin, Poznan, Warsaw
Once lockdown ends it's going to depend on the time of year
Given that I can't take time off in term time I likely won't get away until winter, in which case it could be Funchal in Madeira or Las Palmas in Gran Canaria
Lisbon is a nice city, but personally I think Lisboa is better
Estonian and Lithuanian are the furthest away that I've seen here, though Polish, Irish and Dutch numberplates are the most common foreign plates to see here
I've seen a car on Ukrainian licence plates in one of the towns on Lake Maggiore in Italy
That's gotta be around a 2000km drive
Ireland
Scotland
Germany
Depends on the sport
In rugby normally Japan or Italy
In soccer, Iceland or Italy (or whoever is playing England)
In hockey, I tend to follow Team Canada (Wales don’t have an ice hockey team and I only semi follow GB hockey, more into the club game though)
I find Kaliningrad fascinating
My first thoughts
My second thoughts
These next few days are gonna be rough
Trust me, it ain't worth it lol
England trying to do an Edward Longshanks 2: Electric Boogaloo
England, again
England
Not like it hasn't happened before
[Euros Childs - Cwtsh]
We just got [Yma o Hyd] (meaning Still Here in English) to the top of the iTunes UK charts the other week
In my opinion it's a great song and totally deserves to be up there, but outside of Wales no one will likely ever hear it
Hagrid had a Southwestern accent actually, like a farmer
I never did
We just brought what we needed for each day
We only had lockers available when we were in 6th form which is the final two (non-compulsory) years of school
Even then there was a like 1/2 pound deposit for the key
I never bothered with one though
It was annoying on days in younger years when you had like catering and PE on the same day, or just needed a lot of stuff for one day, but it was never the end of the world
Some people used to just get huge bags and take everything for school everyday, but usually you would only need like 3-5 books and then it’s pens/pencils
Nope, I don't think any of the secondary schools in my area have them (could be wrong though)
We had to carry everything with us in a rucksack and it could get heavy if you had to bring in a lot of things that particular day
Like 6-7 books at most, I think
As far as I can remember, any big textbooks were just kept in the classrooms instead of being taken away by students
I only really felt overloaded on days when I had my PE kit too
Cool flag / fake funny words (Contrary to popular belief , Popty ping is NOT microwave in Welsh)
All of our castles
Hmm, I'm going to haphazardly guess Crete or the Basque country
They are, but we have either the most per area or the most per population
I can't remeber which but Slovakia has the other statistic I think
We have the most per square mile I believe
Seams to be the done thing on our isles tbf
Would you rather I used the term British isles
I was trying to be polite
C'mon we're all celts here
Exactly
Jesus
I forgot how tetchy the Irish can be on here
lol
Yeah sadly that definitely seams the case
I know most of ya guys over the Irish sea are decent reasonable folk, I never doubt that for a second but ya definitely do have a few prats out there who seam intent on having a barny online
Sad that tbh
No problem west Britian
I've always thought we look like a bank robber (England) with the mask still hanging off their head (Scotland) and a bag of money under their arm (Wales), running up some stairs (France/Belgium/Netherlands)
And I guess they also have a ghost sidekick (Ireland)
Not gonna lie, this is starting to sound like a cartoon, and I'd watch it
Huh, so it does
Though he could also have just dropped something into Cardigan Bay and is trying to reach down to catch it
Well the only Welsh language song to ever make the UK charts is [Yma O Hyd - Dafydd Iwan] which made the charts at the start of this year despite being 40 years old
As far as I know there isn't a Welsh language specific music chart (I could well be wrong though) so other than that I don't know
Yeah I gathered this from my Northern friends at uni
We actually had an “Anything but the south social” which was Welsh, Irish, Scottish and Northern society
Was a good laugh and fun to get away from the main demographic for a while
Isn't Vilnius the capital
That is the main demographic at my uni though since I’m in uni in the south, I see how that wasn’t clear though
I believe it was the Northern society’s idea
They’re originally a Celtic people group like Irish Scottish and Welsh (Manx too), and their language, which only a few hundred speak and not natively though the revival is growing, is very closely related to Welsh and Breton
They have a few Celtic traditions and whenever I’ve been on holiday there they are very welcoming on hearing Welsh people, apparently significantly more than a southern English person, especially if they are buying a second home there
I believe they recently introduced some sort of ban on second homes there somewhere
Not one of these groups are the same either tbf, but I see what you mean, cider country is a little different, and somewhere else on reddit today I was talking about the Celtic origins of Cornwall
Yeah I only really knew about it originally from going there, and my mum saying they are like Welsh people
I looked into the history more recently and it’s pretty interesting
I lived at home until 18, and come home for fairly long periods when there’s breaks from university
If I brought a one night stand over I’d probably get mocked a lot and maybe asked not to do it
When I had a girlfriend we were given privacy (we were about 16/17)
We still were cautious about it because there was always a chance if someone knocking on the door to come in
They knew what was happening and must’ve been okay with it, but we never had a clear conversation about it
I'm 22 and still live at home
I've never been in a relationship or brought anyone home, and personally I wouldn't want to just because of how awkward it would be
However I don't think my parents would really care if I was in a relationship and they had already met them, unless I was being too loud
In fact they'd probably be relieved at this point
Barry Town Council threatened to take Tim Martin to the Court of Chivalry, after a [JD Wetherspoon pub in the town was refurbished, and they incorporated a coat of arms into the pub carpet]
> When they abolished a load of quangos (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations) in 2010 there were some spectacular losses, including the Hearing Aid Council and the Horserace Totalisator Board
That cull killed off [Becta] which I still have mixed feelings over
They were at least useful for being able to go onto their website and finding briefing notes you could print off and hand to head teachers etc, when your school was considering buying something like a [Virtual Learning Environment]
Now
Every school does their own thing in terms of IT procurement
You end up having no two schools locally using the same system, so you can't even phone someone in the next town over and ask how, say, Google Suite is working out for them
I really like [Hen Wlad fy Nhadau] its beautiful and makes me proud to be Welsh every time I hear it
God Save the Queen can fuck off
I like it, it describes the county and that we're loyal to it
I only know Gwlad Gwlad off the top of my head
I like it though
It's the only song I really belt out
makes me proud aswell
I think we do better in sports games because of the anthem, it's awesome
Definitely
Wearing a Wales jersey means so much more for Welsh sportspeople than it does for the English
Thats rugby players for you
OK, this won't be in a dictionary, but the colloquial word for microwave is popty ping
Oven = popty, lit
Bake House, microwave popty ping
Animal names in Welsh are funny
We have Buwch Goch Gota lit
Little Red Cow (ladybird/bug)
Pili pala = butterfly
Bochdew "Fat Cheek" (Hamster)
Mouse is Llygoden, rat is Llygoden Fawr (big mouse)
Then there's mwg drwg "naughty smoke" (cannabis)
The Welsh word for Jellyfish is quite cute:
Pysgod Wibli Wobli
Wibbly Wobbly fish :D
Primary schools in the UK have been calling insects "Minibeasts" for about the past 30 years, which just annoys me unnecessarily
I prefer cont-y-môr! Also cont-y-bin (wasp) and cont-yr-awyr (seagull)
Yup, "mae'r popty ping yn popio popgorn tan mae e'n mynd yn bing"
Welsh needs no help in annoying learners, believe me
Not as far as I know
But I did some digging and it seems they're called God's Little Cow in some slavic languages
Also, weren't they farmed like cows on Mars in Futurama
All true wonders of Cymraeg
The commercial is all bright primary colours, with kids smashing the toys together and the scene changes every three seconds
I can picture it now
Oh, I'd forgotten oblong
I think the proper word is meicrodon, no where near as exciting
Though it does sound like a very small member of the mafia
Yeah that's right, ton = wave, meicrodon = micro wave
I also like meicrosglod (microchip)
I went down an Internet rabbithole and returned with [this]
"Liverpool is a football club" and "Liverpool are a football club" both sound fine to me, for some reason
Some things seem interchangeable like that, others don't.
Most natives seem to do that too
I'm always a little tempted to pronounce "Beethoven" as "Beef Oven" just to annoy people
To me, that's got a similar feeling to "the trouble", except it sounds more like you're talking about one of a known *group* of "Troubles" instead of a single standalone thing
But yeah, the normal phrasing would be either "trouble" or "some trouble".
The Government has seats on one side of the House (the left as the TV cameras look at it), and all other parties sit opposite, as per [this diagram]
Honestly
Just speaking Welsh is a word game
SOME consonants at the beginning of words change in certain grammatical situations
A C can change to a G, a CH or NGH
The capital is Cardiff (Caerdydd) ...
I live in Cardiff
**Dwi'n byw yng Nghaerdydd**
I am going to Cardiff
**Dwi'n mynd i Gaerdydd**
I have lived in Penarth and Cardiff
**Dw i wedi byw ym Mhenarth a Chaerdydd**
Endless fun
Especially looking stuff up in the dictionary
Luckily, someone has now figured out a [shortcut]
Like in English we sometimes admit to having Betty Swollocks to keep it polite
Well Welsh has official status in Wales, equal to English
All public services must be available bilingually etc
Its use differs area to area
Generally the further you get from the capital, the higher the chance of hearing it
It is the de-facto language of my workplace  and I have friends with kids who will only learn English when they start school
It'll be interesting to see census data next year compared to 2011 because living next door to England is a pretty rough environment for any minority language in which to survive, but survive it does
The unity of the tribes and the establishment of the kingdom of Wales
Then we would have had a chance to fight against the english properly
I would probably have to say the Glyndŵr Revolt at the beginning on the 15th century because, although it is not certain, Wales would probably have become independent from England whilst including all the things Glyndŵr himself wanted for Wales such as 2 universities, an updated version of the laws of Hywel Dda from the 9th-10th centuries and a Welsh parliament  among other things
These were fairly big things for a small country to have, and if he had succeeded, which he came really close to might I add, Wales might still have be independent today
Have Henry Percy wait for Glyndŵr’s forces at the Battle of Shrewsbury and win the battle, splitting England in 2 and securing an independent Wales
Even if it didn’t last, it would have expanded Wales’ borders and given us a much more powerful voice within a British context
Either that or the Miner’s Strike
Our stupid inheritance laws really fucked us over
I agree with all the Glyndŵr / Independence posts, but if we're talking coal and Wales, preventing Aberfan would top my list there
Absolutely agree with that
Yeah
But for a few hours either way and the school would have been empty
Not exclusively, plenty will walk on the right but now you've mentioned it I guess I do tend to keep left most of the time
In britain in the 17th century there where the highwaymen
They where simular to outlaws in the US that they would hold stage coaches and rob wealthy travelers on their travels
The most famous example being dick turpin
In many ways they where the antecedents of the american outlaws in the old west era
Neither was poland
In fairness France was a vanquished occupied nation so I don't think it would have been right to invite the French
It would be nice for the UK to have a *decent* high-speed rail network like you see in France, Germany or Italy
It wouldn't be ideal for rural areas though, I think a more 'comprehensive' rail network like Switzerland's would be better suited to many parts of Wales
Also, embrace the concept of running trains and buses to more rural areas because they're a *public service*, and not just a way to cream profits off and make shareholders richer
Yup, my local line is one train in each direction per hour
Even getting that to one train each way every 30 minutes would be a major improvement
Yeah, I know what you mean
The equivalent local train prices in Italy are so low by comparison, we usually have to make sure that we've bought enough return tickets for the family
It's bloody daft given the more attractive rail franchises are the Intercity ones with flash new trains, as opposed to the rural ones
Councils can't just stop maintaining the minor A or B road through your village because part of the M1 is more important
True, GWR is an outlier here
Countryfile isn't that militant
Yet
Wales never really developed historically famous liquors
There’s Penderyn Whiskey now which is very well acclaimed
I don’t really drink enough whiskey to tell you, but people seem to enjoy it
There’s some Welsh Gins becoming famous too, but I can’t think of them off the top of my head
Beer was and is the drink of Wales, which is obviously not a liquor
Brains Beer and Wrexham Lager are quite famous and have been about for over a hundred years I believe
There’s a huge craft beer and cider scene now with companies like Tiny Rebel and Gwynt y Ddraig becoming big around the U.K. and smaller ones like Tenby Brewing and Glamorgan Brewing Company making stuff too

Also, comparing everything in r/soccer to an American equivalent
Anyone: "A club the size of Man Utd should really be aiming to win the league
American #1: "For context, we have a local NFL franchise here in Dallas, and they haven't won a divisional championship since 19blahblah
American #2: "But they came close in 2001 when they had Durk Manyguns as quarter-back
They beat us (Yanktown Wankers) in the quarter-divisional south championship

I didn't have to scroll far to see an uplifting story about several first responders during a crisis in the US stopping trying to help people to instead pray with an already safe woman
Like
good for her I guess that she got comforted but is that really uplifting
or a good idea
Well not necessarily bad, but I think it's safe to say that most of Europe agrees that we shouldn't be handing them out to everyone like they're charity leaflets
You're just being obtuse man it's pretty obvious what he meant
No, it's exclusively tabloid newspapers like The Sun that use fahrenheit to make the temperature seem higher than it actually is
Many Welsh place names are either slightly different in English (Cardiff - Caerdydd) or entirely different (Swansea - Abertawe)
There’s also the same for English places in Welsh, for example Bath - Caerfaddon or York - Efrog, and then extending that, New York - Efrog Newydd
There's loads in Welsh;
New York - Efrog Newydd
Cambridge - Caergrawnt
Oxford - Rhydychen
Rome - Rhufain
are just a few
Just focusing on the Welsh names, it's a fairly simple naming process
Places with Aber is where two bodies of water join
Usually a river with the sea (Ystwyth and Tawe) or two rivers (Cynon)
Places with Llan means church/parish of
Where I live, Llangrallo, the Saint of my local church is St Crallo
The C mutates to a G. Llantrisant means church of the three saints
(Llan-tri-sant)
Places with Caer is a good sign the Romans were there, and there's a castle/fort
Chester is just Caer, Carmarthen is Caerfyrddin, Caernarfon
Places with Bont has a big/significant bridge going over a river
May sometimes mutate to Pont
They occasionally do it with London (Llundain) on some signs but it seems fairly arbitrary whether they put Welsh names for English places on signs
Bryste is indeed the Welsh name for it (actually I live in Bristol now)
It’s just a welshified version of it, same as Lerpwl for Liverpool
I actually saw a bus service from Newport in Bristol the other day with “Bryste” as the destination on the front which made me do a double take aha
You hear the Welsh names for English cities on trains travelling towards England
People once spoke a language like Welsh in England so it's understandable
Amwythig (fortified place) for Shrewsbury is the most different sounding one I can think of
Also in political news in Welsh you'll hear San Steffan for Westminster
Parliament originally met in St Stephen's Chapel
Had a look at that last night - some of the satellite imagery is more up to date than Google Maps for a few towns I travel through often
I say I'm from Wales and if they don't know what that is I say UK

some old crone tried to buy my flock of sheep for some magic beans the other day
jokes on her magic beans go for £500/kilo
Never had it, but I'm not much of a seafood person in general
In terms of UK as a whole - I'd say anywhere that's not England, prolly mostly Wales as a whole (with the whole 'sheep shagger' thing)
In Wales - unsure really
Everywhere's a little bit of a meme I can't lie
EDIT: !!! The Midlands in England too
Mainly Birmingham afaik as well
Rhyl
Rhyl or Port Talbot are probably the closest we have
Arguably Swansea, Newport or Bridgend too
Absolutely not
I'm rather fond of not worrying whether my kids will get shot at school
Plus I like not being bankrupted by our healthcare system and the food safety standards are much higher at here
USA is a great place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there
I'm used to the comforts of home and not willing to give those up
If I was single it might be a different story but I don't think I'd like my children to grow up there
No, I just can't imagine fitting in with the US culture
Because of how similar it is to British (ie both English speaking, on top of other similarities) the differences would seem more distinct
Like I don't think I could ever adapt to summarising chips and fries into just fries and crisps into chips
Bit pedantic, but its the sort of thing that would cause everyday annoyance and confusion that would make life a hassle
No, everything is too big and car orientated, they put weird chemicals in the food and the guns would scare me
Also crazy stupid healthcare costs
I'm fairly certain you can buy disposable seat covers on the cheap if that's all you're missing in your life
Even that would make me uneasy
I prefer it here where I never have to think about guns as nobody has them
I do 4/5 too for childcare purposes
I have Wednesdays off and it's a fantastic split in the week
I'll be sad going back to 5/5
I saw 6 boxes of 50 covers for under  £4 on Amazon UK
That's 300 public poos
Not sure, but curry sauce and chips is popular in Wales
In Wales we have the Mabinogion
Centuries old folk tales that have inspired a lot of modern fantasy literature
Really good read
During the lockdown, mountain goats started roaming my town, Llandudno in North Wales

I'm not going to go mental at them for calling a lorry a semi truck or anything
In fact I quite enjoy saying "we do x here

That said it does get annoying when people assume that all of the UK works in the same way, or all of Europe does (usually by assuming that something we do in the UK is Europe-wide, lol)
I mean, Carl Sagan is very well known in Britain as far as science communicators go
Well, "what's it like having a monarchy

Ditto the idea that most of Western Europe drives on the left :P
>I see this too often where people think that Germany (and all of europe) drives on the left side of the road
This was the one I was thinking of, yeah
Any safety critical role that sees you in charge of thousands of people a day will see the big £££'s roll in
Birmingham is more associated with the [Balti style curry]
In general older people are more nostalgic for it as they see it as a time when Britain was THE world power
I've seen polls where a sizeable number of them would like to bring it back
Contrastingly a much larger number of younger people see it as colonialism at its worst and are far more negative of that period of our history
Yes there is a very interesting generational dynamic for the last decade or possibly even longer
Younger people don't identify as British, rather as Welsh only, whereas older people are far more likely to identify as British only or Welsh and British
Just moved back home before lockdown started after 4 years in England/ Germany
Its good to be back but the pace of life is noticeably slower (mostly because Im from the countryside and spent my time in cities in England and Germany)
Perhaps you might want to try out the Welsh word [hiraeth] Seems to be similar to your meaning there
Yes, Portuguese right
I’ve heard that they are very similar meanings
I wear a white poppy to commemorate all who have died in all wars along with the demand that no more should die in any war
I don't. I appreciate what it represents and I remember the fallen of WW1 & 2 (including some of my own ancestors) quietly in my own way on Rememberance Day
Unfortunately the poppy has been hijacked by right wing British nationalists and thats something I just can't support
These are the same people who happily gloss over the the many crimes committed by the British army all over the world (including in Wales)
Not at all
Most European languages have a shortened name for it so English was an outlier
Czechia is so much less of a mouthful
I was calling it Czechia before I'd realised they officially changed it to Czechia
To me it just sounds natural
True, but you lot do also tend to call the UK Großbritannien or England so Geography clearly isn't the German school system's strong point ;)
He was spot on haha
The Welsh flag is pretty epic as is but I like the [battle flag of Owain Glyndwr] during his rebellion
we like dragons
I like [the flag/banner of Owain Glyndwr] which used to be historical but has seen a significant resurgence over the last few decades
Not necessarily
It has been used by nationalists, but no more than the actual Welsh flag or [the Flag of Saint David] I believe a similar variation is used in the coat of arms of the modern Prince of Wales, so it could be seen as quite British too
Glyndŵr's rebellion is interesting though and many things are still named after him here, including a few streets near me (eg Glyndŵr Lane) and even a [university]
IIRC you can basically 'split' Welsh into a dialect used in the North and a dialect used in the South
There are several words that are different, my Welsh is rusty now but I think the word for 'milk' is different in the two dialects
Amazing that people can be so
petty, I guess

English, Welsh, French, German, Polish, Spanish, Italian, Swedish & Portuguese off the top of my head
Welsh is "Diolch yn fawr" FWIW
English , Welsh , Irish , French , Spanish , German , Portuguese , Italian , Russian , Catalan  (just saw it here though so maybe cheating), Swedish (and other Scandinavian languages if they are all takk)

Not sure if anything's happened here similar to that though
Personally, it's just another example of "offended culture".
I do know that in the UK at least, anything that The Sun newspaper does is generally seen in a negative light in Liverpool
I never really got the problem with this
People miss home comforts and sometimes you just want a burger or cornflakes or something
Honestly, spending a week in Singapore and trying 21 brand new dishes sounds a bit exhausting
I think I tend to average out at 2:1 new local food to western food
I find it's a good mix of trying new things with one thing a day I know I'll like
But, y'know, everyone's different and it's up to you
We were where the industrial revolution started in the late 1700s
Agreed - terroir is important

Germany
Small country by all metric measurements (ie if all overseas territories are considered then the UK and France catch up) but economically nobody competes
Quiet carriages are only really a feature on long-distance or Intercity trains
Cross Country withdrew them in 2014
South Western Railway is considering scrapping them, and LNER seem to have reintroduced them on the East Coast Main Line
I find First Class is generally pretty quite on ~~Virgin~~ Avanti services, that said we only do it a couple of times a year as a holiday 'treat'. Only had one bad journey
Cardiff has a lot to do and see so I guess it wins that one
Really the only other candidate is Swansea
Yeah, Conwy's a nice town (I think you've had this reply :P)
I like the medieval walls and the castle
The definitions of "city" get very weird very quickly in the UK depending on when the city became a city, if it has a Cathedral, if it was granted city status during a Queen's Jubilee, etc etc
Outside of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport Wales doesn't have any other 'big cities'. We've got towns that have a larger population than some of our 'cities'.
Only ever been for a day trip, but I can see why people like it, yeah
Oh, yeah, you can be out in the countryside or the coast very quickly
You've still got a decent rail and motorway link to London too
The Gower Peninsula and the Mumbles are both worth a visit in nice weather
Nice one
Re the train - I would guess it's because you change in London
We have a pretty strong Facebook meme community
But we haven't really made it to reddit yet
I don't use all, unfortunately I do still get UK news which is equally as depressing
I can still smell the Jorvik Viking Museum, York, UK
We have a [deep pit mine] very nearby which is now a National Museum (mining is a huge part of our history and basically the only reason people live here) so that was proper cool and something I always remember
Like an aquarium after an arson attack
We had sex ed lessons in biology in school but that was literally the science of sex (ie sperm + egg = baby) a few years later we had lessons on contraception and STIs but by then everyone was addicted to porn anyway
Mostly sex ed in school, but one Christmas when I was about 11-12 I had a book about it in my presents (and spent more effort keeping my little brother from seeing it than I did reading it)
We had fairly basic sex ed in Year 6, the teacher stopped the video when everyone got a bit too giggly and established that we were all just a bit embarrassed
Science lessons in year 7 or 8 went back over the use of condoms etc, and then we had more sex ed in Year 11
We're linked to Argentina through the Welsh speaking enclaves in Patagonia
Early 1800's people were leaving Wales as the industrial revolution took away their jobs and they set sail across the Atlantic to Puerto Madryn
Argentine government eventually clamped down on the colonisers but they still speak Welsh and still turn up for the Eisteddfod every year
The timing of the [Aberfan Disaster] always seems particularly cruel
The school was buried under the avalanche of coal waste barely 15 minutes after lessons had started that morning - and the school was due to close at 1200 the same day for a half-term holiday
Yes but the thousand year rivalry was a direct result of the complications caused by the conquest
Also England changed massively after the conquest so arguably it's still important in that respect
Going from a moving speech to "iconoclastic fury" to declaring independence from the most powerful empire in the world in a just 15 years sounds like a pretty quick escalation
Can confirm it’s either “I’m going for a piss” or “I’m going for a shit” for at least my area, but it’s quite rough around here
My dad when he came to the uk from Zimbabwe was confused why there were no public toilets in London
He spoke to my grandmother and she said go to a wc and he was confused what a wc was because they were just called public toilets in zim
I think they’re great
We have names like Aberaeron and Llanelli which don’t have English names but are nice and they we have places that do have English names (Caerdydd-> Cardiff) that I think are better in Welsh but are still good
That being said, Machynlleth and Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychchwyrndrobwyllsantysiliogogogoch are just unnecessary (still great though
I love Welsh place names as they describe the area :)
Common prefixes to place names in Wales are:
Aber - Estuary/Confluence
Caer - Fort/Castle (Chester is simply "Caer" as it was the Roman's main fortress in the area
Llan - Church/Parish/Monastery
Go look up place names in Welsh for all across the UK
Kaer literally means Fort in Welsh :) (Though spelt Caer nowadays), also "Gwynbleidd", Geralt's Elven name is just Blaidd Gwyn (White Wolf) but with the noun-adjective backwards
The ['Green desert'] , a large expanse of upland in mid Wales
It has limited infrastructure and is really only inhabited by small villages and isolated farming settlements, with a few larger towns on the outskirts along rivers
Yeah, I think these are the most common warning signs people will think of for the UK, along with the signs warning of [overhead live wires] or [live rails] on the railway network
[These ones]  with the stick man being electrocuted are good
Got the Welsh bilingual signs there too
...did you see the Styrian Grand Prix
Oh yes
Not so much Ferrari sadly
Hoping for a better race today
I put both eggs and milk in the fridge
For the eggs, I find they last longer if they’re in the fridge
I'm not sure about the two things you ask being connected, the first part of the question is easy enough to answer as plenty of places in the UK take excellent care of Roman architecture, for example the Roman Baths in Bath
I have never known anyone saying they took pride in being part of an ancient empire though, it's more viewed as a joke in sketches like Monty Python "what have the Romans ever done for us"
Britons didn't destroy everything
They were abandoned by Rome (for good reason) and were unable to defend themselves against the picts and the Irish, and later the Anglo-Saxons
Plus, most of the Romano-British cities were maintained by the empire and were unsustainable once the empire left
Dark ages of Europe is a myth
But for Britain it was very real
Writing disappeared from England for over a century
There was a massive population decline
The majority language of the populace completely changed
Christianity, which was commonly adopted by the Germanic migrants on the continent, was displaced in England by the pagan religion of the Anglo-Saxons
In most of the Empire it was only the administration that changed
For ordinary people life was much the same
However Britain was very much colonised by the Anglo-Saxons (whether this involved genocide of the more murderous kind is up for debate
Personally I think that most of the population remained the same, but the new rulers imposed laws that resulted in much of the populace converting (with very little mass murder being involved))
Although during the roman period, British civilisation was mostly limited to the cities (which is why when they declined so too did civilisation (the Anglo-Saxons weren't initially fond of cities as I understand it)), so it's not surprising that it was more fragile than Gaul and Southern Europe
Important to realise that for the vast, vast majority of people it’s an occasional weekend treat, maybe to try to shift a hangover - and usually becomes breakfast and lunch
The exception is mostly people with fairly physical jobs, who need calories
e.g. if you go to a “greasy spoon” cafe on a weekday, they’re usually full of builders and other tradesmen, with the odd group of students who haven’t been to bed yet
>if any damages were caused during this period by people under the influence, the state would be liable to pay out the compensation due to negligence so long as the damage were physical
So you're saying that if I filed a civil suit against a tortfeasor for damages to my property, and the Def
filed a Defence disputing liability because drugs were temporarily \*legal, a judge would side against me and/or order the claim be redirected

I definitely automatically try and speak with less of a Welsh accent when in England/talking to strangers in England
It’s mostly subconscious but also just for communication
I have had people who try and make jokes and stuff
Also, sometimes friends will argue about pronunciations/words for things but that’s usually in good faith
Overall the idea is that people with strong accents are working class or sometimes stupid, which is a little annoying, and it makes me want to speak in my accent more
I'm welsh, live in north wales and have most of my life but have an oxford accent due to living there for a few years as a child
I actually get mocked more than any scousers around here because I have such a weird accent comparatively
Okay, i am fully fine with putting ketchup on mashed potatoes because as a kid we would do this and mash the ketchup into the potato
with that said this was only when we had ketchup for some other thing that was by the potato, it was not intended to be ketchup on potato by my mother at least
Ketchup on PASTA however is a shocking abomination
We all know curry sauce is the superior sauce, come on now
Honestly I don’t like sausage rolls, vegan or otherwise, Greggs or otherwise
But I am experiencing withdrawal symptoms from Greggs vegan steak bakes
Idk if we’re all talking the same type of cheesecake, but my paternal grandparents hail from poland, and I grew up with a cheesecake  that I always knew as either “Jewish cheesecake” (just because they bought cheesecake for us from local Jewish bakeries where they lived in London) or “krakow cheesecake
” [Heres What I mean] which case I prefer it without raisins but I don’t mind them with raisins - adds a bit of variety if eating a larger chunk of cheesecake
It’s really nice
When I visit my grandparents, we always get cheesecake and while I hugely prefer the cheesecake without raisins, I also like it with raisins
They don’t have a raisiny taste, it just makes the texture more varied
I think it works for a dense but creamy type of cheesecake - I don’t see it working so well for a New York style cheesecake or whatever
Mind you I usually eat the cheesecake with raisins in slices from a loaf of cheesecake, and I think eating it from a round cake with slices wouldn’t be as nice either
Ah okay, [this is what I meant by cheesecake] but your style of cheesecake is the most common/popular in Wales, and yeah, not a good idea to have with raisins
Cymru - The English name "Wales" means "foreigners" whereas the Welsh name "Cymru" means "fellow countrymen". Just a bit nicer if you ask me
If switch Wales to Cambria, partially due to etymology but also because it's much easier to use as a demonym
Wales derives from old English "wealas" meaning foreigner or stranger
This is especially ironic because at the time the English were foreigners to Britain who were invading
Cambria derives from the Welsh word for Wales (Cymru) and has the same meaning (country or countrymen)
Also it's easier to call someone a Cambrian than a "welshman", "welshwoman", "welshperson", etc
I would either add the h back or change our name to "Dragons
Serious answer would be Cambria, the Latin name for Wales
Same etymology as our name for ourselves, Cymru, but I think it avoids the confusion of the u making an e sound for English speakers
It's a bit weird for English
Cambria (the Latin name for wales) derives from the same etymology but fits much better in English, so personally I think it is better suited
Drop the "r" for ease of pronunciation
Anatolia maybe
Turkland and turkia invokes the same imagery
Tfw English gets it right for once
>I think there are other regions in Europe with similar names in english and german, but I can’t remember them right now
Yeah, Cornwall in England has the same route, and I think theres a place in Switzerland too
(Bonus fun fact: Cumbria in England has the same route as Cymru)
>how do you read cymru
Is is like “Kumru”? It sounds badass but I’m not sure I say it right
"Kum-ree" is the best way I can describe it haha
Only problem with Cambria is that its so similar to Cumbria
I could see people confusing the two
1) Historically (at least during parts of the Roman period) Thrace was considered a part of Anatolia (probably due to Constantinople) though I understand the usage may have changed since then
I can't dispute the other two though
2) Fair enough, makes sense (and is something that I wouldn't have known about since I've always thought about Anatolia in the geographical sense)
I am, but I should probably go on a diet
Can I say the U.K.? When I was younger I thought we were so stable and that there was nothing wrong with having a figurehead monarchy and the way our government works
Now I feel alienated from my own government
I don’t think Westminster represents me (or Wales) in the slightest
There’s no respect for diversity (whether that be diversity in terms of communities from outside the U.K. or from things such as Welsh language communities within the U.K.), Wales has never voted for a Conservative government but we are forced to accept one
It just makes me feel like we are being government by a politically and culturally distant entity
As far as I can tell a number of English people feel the same way, so it’s by no means unique to my point of view as someone who is Welsh
It’s a frustrating position to be in, because I never conceived of living elsewhere but the political and social climate here is so toxic that I might have to leave if only for a few years
I only shared a washing machine in my first year of university
There were 2 between about 70-80 people
It was very annoying to carry a load of clothes down two flights of stairs and down a corridor just to turn back when both machines were full
Plus we had to pay for the machines anyway, £2 per wash
I would rather that to be absorbed into my rent and have one in my flat, than try and snipe opportunities to actually clean my clothes
The one positive is that when the pound coins updated the machine still took the old ones so I managed to get it for ‘free’ for a while, since my family gave me all their old coins
Even the people I know who did vote for what you’ve said describe a disconnect from their government
It genuinely feels like we are on the brink of *something* but I really don’t know what it is
There’s some sort of political brink being reached
Thank God it’s not my problem to solve
It does feel hard for me to ditch Wales and my family especially after the way this year has affected us, but I think I need to for myself, and it’s not like I can’t come back
Just hard to see what the world will be like post-COVID lol
Does the part where they suppressed the welsh language for favour of english and punished our children for it count
Yes
Just let us enjoy our own language and culture in peace
Well, tbh
We were one of the first to get forced to use it as our official language
I'm a bit annoyed, but, eh, not that annoyed
Gyda chi frawd
Cymru am byth
Just under a quarter of the Welsh population speak Welsh, mostly in the west and northwest of the country
As someone from the deepest, darkest southeast I am not among them unfortunately, but hopefully one day I will be
My county has (I believe) the lowest number of Welsh speakers in all of Wales
Edit: turns out we are only the second lowest (sarcastic cheer)
Currently learning Welsh so I can communicate better with some of my older relatives
Even though it's an official language in Wales, less than 30% speak it and it is like a minority language
Even by those who speak it, it isn't really used conversationally much
I have hopes that recent government efforts will revive it though
I've been learning Welsh
I can read a bit, but I'm way way off fluent
Mum's side of the family are from the south-west of Wales, and are all Welsh speakers
Dad's side are from the north-east of Wales, which is mainly an English-speaking area
Mum did think of teaching me to speak Welsh outside of school, but didn't. I did pick up German and to some degree French reasonably well in High School
Back in the 1990s all languages were optional past Year 9 (age 14), so I opted to carry on with German and French and drop Welsh
Welsh was undergoing something of a revival but I'd say that really 'took off' around the mid 1990s when the law gave it equal status with English
just as I stopped studying it
I do think I should go back and try something like Duolingo to pick it back up
I'd say Welsh is the healthiest of the minority native languages here in the UK, the 2011 UK Census put the number of Welsh speakers at ~562,000, or around 20% of the population
Now, that figure is a self-reported answer for people who have some level of Welsh language skills, however, as opposed to full fluency
There is still the east - west split with areas near the English border having a [lower percentage of Welsh speakers]
The language is still used widely on a day to day basis, even if you don't speak it
There's a Welsh-language TV station, [S4C] and a Welsh language [radio station] from the BBC
All [road signs] and [markings] are bilingual, with a recent law not only giving Welsh and English status as official languages of Wales, but also requiring all new and replacement signs to [put the Welsh text first] like this [example] Sticking with travel, at major railway stations in places like Cardiff, Swansea and Wrexham the Welsh language announcements will sound before the English ones
There are probably more examples, but those are the main ones the average visitor to Wales will encounter
Monmouthshire
>Edit: turns out we are only the second lowest (sarcastic cheer)
I got Torfaen to third lowest on Wikipedia, behind Blaenau Gwent and Newport
I'm in Flintshire, which was at ~20% which surprised me a little
I was expecting one of the lowest percentage areas to be us or Wrexham honestly
I have had contact with the welsh government education department, and they said they are looking for a way that will teach children welsh, so they will be willing to understand it and treat it like a btec
Torfaen, even Monmouthshite ranks better than us
Each one says something different, but the one I saw estimates that as of last Summer we're at 17
7% which is 2% higher than Bridgend and 0
1% lower than Monmouthshire
Honestly, I think it's the 'willing to learn' it part - I have relatives who recently finished high school and didn't see the point in learning Welsh
They couldn't put their finger on *why* exactly but it's probably a combination of things that put me off
* It wasn't taught very well (IMO)
* We weren't given a sense that it was our native language, or how there were repeated attempts to wipe it out
* The north-east of Wales is mainly-English-speaking, so you get a chicken and egg sort of situation around the language where nobody learns it because they can't really use it on a daily basis
Yes, I can never seem to find a consistent source for this stuff so just go with Wikipedia generally
It is a very weird case, there are rising numbers in every day speakers but the education system is failing to keep a constant link to the language and the people that embrace it
There was a review done where the more people start to flourish their welsh identity are more willing to back the learning of welsh in the country, and more recently so with the backing of welsh independence
We probably won't have any reliable figures until the census next year
Welsh medium schools are fairly successful and often are rated higher than English medium schools though
It also means that children to become fluent in the language
In English medium schools it’s just barely there
I’ve learned more Welsh on Duolingo and online than I ever did in school
I’m not sure if they can make the lessons better and more appealing to the point where people who speak English at home and live in a mostly English speaking town would switch to using Welsh
>There was a review done where the more people start to flourish their welsh identity are more willing to back the learning of welsh in the country, and more recently so with the backing of welsh independence
That wouldn't surprise me - but to get there we'd actually have to learn some recent Welsh history in school, too
I think its the implementation of it in schools, i used to live in wales in a english speaking town but rooted deeply in welsh history and plan on moving back very soon, i stayed their for all of primary school, and the welsh we got taught progressed to a point where when we had welsh lessons the entirety of the lesson was taught in welsh
The english medium schools, realistically need a more solid approach such as assemblies in welsh and more within the school day than just one lesson, but seeing the rise in welsh medium schools have made me very proud of the progression of our country since the language was banned
Very true
Yeah I think Welsh medium is probably good but obviously there needs to be a load of Welsh speaking teachers in all subjects
I lived in an English speaking town and once we got to year 9 all of our Welsh lessons were just how to pass the GCSE not how to speak Welsh sadly
We only had 2 hours a week so there was no time to learn anything other than that
I remember being angry about things like Aberfan and Tryweryn when I discovered the extent of them - but we never learned about either of them in school
When i learnt of it i was very young but understood the level of seriousness about it, but it didn't hit home in terms of my nationality and patriotic pride until i revisited it later on in my english exams  where we compared Aberfan and Tryweryn to a article written about an earthquake in london
To be honest it made me think about the way others schools within the UK talk about it as well
>When i learnt of it i was very young but understood the level of seriousness about it, but it didn't hit home in terms of my nationality and patriotic pride until i revisited it later on in my english exams where we compared Aberfan and Tryweryn to a article written about an earthquake in london
Similar for me, but we didn't cover it in exams
I think my feelings of injustice were reinforced by all the shit that came out recently around Hillsborough and Grenfell Tower, in both cases it's like Aberfan all over again and the victims need to be carful they don't get fobbed off
> To be honest it made me think about the way others schools within the UK talk about it as well
Sometimes I wonder if it's even covered outside of Wales :(
It is upsetting and, as a group of the most statistically welcoming people in the UK we need to ensure that we demonstrate support for others that have tragedies similar to ours
Its just the nice thing to do
Fully agree - I have seen newspaper columns warning of the Grenfell families being treated like the Aberfan families already
I thought Norwegian was the most linguistically similar to English
I mean most of western Europe is like that
You could say the same about the South East
This continent is basically tailored specifically for human habitation
Not a lot
I did used to work with a man from Sudan, and he makes tea weird
He once made me a cup of tea which was just a mug of milk, microwaved with a teabag floating in it, ew
Do all you guys make tea like that
The English
Either Hambones or townies
The former is closer to rednecks and the latter closer to chavs
I thought it was Andalusians
There are two 'branches' of Celtic languages:
**Brythonic** - Welsh, Cornish, Breton
**Goidelic** - Irish, Scottish, Manx
That's why you're seeing Scottish and Irish people say they can't understand Welsh in this thread
**Cornish:** I can kind of understand some of it
**Breton:** Never met anyone who can speak it, and I also probably couldn't even if I had because it's a lot closer to Cornish than Welsh
The Britons in Cornwall were separated from the Britons in Wales and Cumbria in the Battle of Deorham in 577, leading to the split in the languages (Welsh and the now extinct Cumbric grew from the western areas of Britain while Cornish and Breton grew from southwestern Britain)
And before anyone asks, I can't really understand Irish or Manx or anything else
Those are all in a different family of languages
I grew up on the isle of Anglesey in north Wales where Welsh is spoken pretty frequently, so I knew how to speak it from a young age
It is taught in schools here, but no one really ever took it seriously, especially in the south from what I've heard
It's a joke (at least in my area) to just say that the only thing that people in southern Wales know how to say in Welsh is "ga i fynd i'r tŷ bach os gwelwch yn dda
" ("can i go to the toilet please
Hung, drawn and quartered
Death by a thousand Sheep
Saying that, most of us would call that bliss
Seamus, get the fertilizer
Learning Welsh is mandatory up till year 11, we learn French or German from year 7 to 9 and then have the option to do GCSE French or German
We also have full Welsh schools where every subject is taught in Welsh and you have to be, or learn to be fluent in Welsh
Spanish is growing and recently overtook German in terms of uptake as many schools are abandoning German in favour of Spanish now
Mandarin is extremely rare, I don't know any schools that offer it
I left high school a long time ago so I can't say for sure, I've heard Spanish is offered in some schools though
Fun and bye are both hwyl in welsh
Increasingly I identify with Wales first, then the UK
Don't really identify with my village or county though
Yeah, probably the county if you wanted to narrow it down
I know in the South it would likely be "The Valleys" for a lot of people
We have a tongue twister 'The sixth sheik's sixth sheep's sick
I've *never* been able to distinguish between those and V/F ("vey fink"), even when somebody's trying to demonstrate the difference to me
To add to that, at "kick-out time" which is mostly 11pm or 2am, you suddenly get hoards of drunk people from different establishments out on the streets in close proximity all at the same time, all vying for food, taxis etc
This has been blamed as one of the reasons for the antisocial behaviour and is one of the things that has been talked about changing (possibly has been changed in some circumstances) to reduce the problems
But once it's part of the culture it's difficult to change it
Wales and New Zealand feel very similar culturally and geographically
Maybe even some of the Canadian maritime provinces as well
A few people have already said New Zealand for both the UK and Scotland, but I've always though NZ is very similar to Wales myself
* largely rural nations
* big farming industry
* more sheep than people, often the target of jokes there
* both export a lot of lamb
* both into Rugby
* both have a larger and more successful, well known neighbour (Australia and England)
I’ve not been but I’ve heard people say similar things about it being like Wales in certain ways (especially rugby)
A part of Warren Gatland’s (Ex-Wales Rugby Coach from NZ) autobiography talks about how when he was first getting the job he was taken in a helicopter ride over the South Wales valleys and the only thing he said is “it looks like back at home”. Partly because of the hills and valleys but also all the rugby posts sticking up in each village
Whoever organised that helicopter ride played a blinder in getting him to take the job aha
Lessons ended before Easter because its the exam period now but we were using Teams or blackboard collaborate
We're just watching sideshows of prerecorded lectures
Voice only, we also have added readings
Then we have a one hour chat on an online discussion board via blackboard
This is once a week
If we didn't have covid it would have been a 2 hour face to face meeting each week
I'm on an
Adult learners course which will hopefully allow me to get on to the course full time once I complete 6 classes
I'm currently on number 4 so fingers crossed
I would definitely say [The Aberfan Disaster] Many still say that it's murder, as the miners had been telling the mine owners that the slag piles were going to collapse for years
Most of the fatalities were schoolchildren (116 out of 144) as the slurry hit a school
[This short BBC video will fill you in]
Southall definitely - it would have been possible to turn the train in the Swansea area, IIRC
Instead it ran with a defective safety system that could have prevented the crash
Also: Clapham Junction in 1988:
Old wiring left in place led to signals displaying wrong aspects, 3 trains collided and 35 people were killed
Another mining disaster that was local to the area I live in:
It was the last day before Half Term too
about and hour later and all the kids wouldnt've been in school
There's no redeeming quality or bright side to Aberfan
It's all just horrible tragedy
Pretty much a lost generation
From what I can tell, it’s very common for people to develop some kind of spirituality around death
Rituals, and things like ‘feeling their presence’ once someone passes away, even if they’re not religious
In fact, so few people have any formal religious belief, and even fewer practice by going to places of worship, but nevertheless people do typically become more spiritual when confronted with death
I think that kind of mysticism is actually very common among anyone who doesn’t see themselves as a committed skeptic or atheist
I don’t personally have any religious belief, nor spirituality, but during hard times I’ve definitely felt like having that feeing of a connection to someone who’s died would make grieving much easier
it was cold, but it never snowed
[This photo]  of the [Aberfan disaster]  in 1966 by David Hurn
That, or the picture of [Susan Maybank being pulled from the wreckage, alive]
I think it was in every story about Aberfan I read when the 50th anniversary was commemorated a few years ago
This might sound weird but I love the way Dutch sounds
Maybe it's because we also have all the same "weird" sounds that Dutch has in Welsh so I'm used to hearing them
German is also very nice
I'm so sorry but to me it sounds like a Russian person trying to speak Spanish
Could have just been regular Danish, after all Danish is unintelligible even to Danes
Probably from Hedd Wyn's WW1 poem 'Arwr':
> A'i gwaed yn gymysg efo'r glaw
Meaning 'And his blood was mixed with the rain
These are very good suggestions
I reckon the first one is certainly the most iconic, especially in terms of being known by people elsewhere
There must be some brilliant Welsh language poetry too, since it’s such a bardic tradition, and it even has its own style, thought it sometimes is hard to distinguish when it’s a poem or a song lol
I can’t think of any specific one like examples sadly
The lines of the anthem and other popular songs like Calon Lân are pretty poetic in my eyes though
For example “Nid wy'n gofyn bywyd moethus,
Aur y byd na'i berlau mân:
Gofyn wyf am galon hapus,
Calon onest, calon lân.”
Which means “I don’t ask for a luxurious life, the world’s gold or it’s fine pearls, I ask for a happy heart, an honest heart, a pure heart”.
Which, while longer than one line, is a very nice sentiment
I'm in Wales, it doesn't exist as far as foreigners are concerned
They think British people either sound like the Queen or Dick Van Dyke's Cockney and have crooked teeth \*sigh\*.
The Anne Frank movie
Pretty much any film set in Germany that I can think of is
ahem, set in the 40s.
There's always the Augustus Gloop scenes in Willy Wonka
Hedwig and the Angry Inch is partially set in East Germany
Surprised noone has mentioned How Green Was My Valley
Brave and Braveheart
It's not foreign though
Dont talk down on the language, we genuinely do speak it and it has 2 more vowels than English come on guys
Tell us to start speaking English
The same applies to Wales
Saw a bullfight in about 2006 and even then it felt really barbaric how they just finished off the bull, cut its ears off and threw them into the crowd, before dragging the corpse away
That said the skill and nerve of the bullfighter was great
Eh they see a nice empty path, with no cars
Why not walk on it, bikes can always go around
(Not my opinion just what people might think)
Welsh is an official language of Wales (alongside English)
Which is more than can be said for England and English
OK, Germany Lite
Probably best not to, some will be offended some won’t, same in Wales
Just stick to Scottish or Welsh
Northern Ireland is a whole new can of worms
People often try to point out that Welsh ‘has no vowels in its words’ sometimes
Some words they’re referring to often have a Y in them, which is in fact a vowel in Welsh
EDIT: forgot
W is also a vowel in Welsh
Americans can do it too
Heard a few horror stories
Yes, indeed
Not any more - there was specific wording in the 1967 Welsh Language Act to change this:
>The fourth section of the Act repealed the provision in Part 3 of the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 that the term "England" should include Wales
Devolution has since given us control of things like healthcare and education, though I will point out that England and Wales still share a legal system
Touché
If you say popty ping
Genuinely never heard anyone use it, truly
But I’m sure Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantisiliogogogoch might get you a lot
It’s pronounced like ‘oo’, as in wool
No-one in the UK thinks IKEA is luxury and I say that as someone who mostly has IKEA furniture
It actually amazes me how Britain could actually be racist towards the Irish
That's like being racist towards your own people
It's insane
Most of it was motivated by religion but the fact that they changed it into a race thing is maddening
There's a large Polish community in Northeast Wales, centered around [Wrexham] There are several "Polski Sklep" type shops in Wrexham, and 10 miles away in the English city of Chester
Most of the large supermarkets have a [few shelves] dedicated to Polish foods, eg Tesco, Asda and Morrisons
I've only been brave enough to buy some of the chocolate bars
and a really helpful Polish guy unwittingly spoiled my fun by explaining what all the flavours were :P
One of my cousins is married to a Polish girl, they turned up to a party once with all sorts of meats - the various sausages in particular were very popular with everyone
In the town i live near there is an entire street just populated with polish residents, there is 4 shops two at each end,(quite a small area where this is), 2 of the shops are corner shops, the other 2 are hardware based
I go in every so often just to get a chocolate bar, but they seem quite friendly and nice to be around
Plenty of polski sklep's in the largest town to me over the English border
Every empty shop there soon seams to have a polski sklep/European foods place
There are Polish people here in Swansea, in fact the influx of Polish people is said to have stopped a Catholic church from closing
I'm a fan of the vegetable stock and the nice big juicy apples that Polish shops sell
Tried that polish beer, warka strong etc
God it gives you a helluva headache the next day though,  its rough as a badgers backside tbh
Veg stock might be a good tip, actually
The Knorr meat stocks have gone a bit poor recently IMO
Germany, so much happened in such a short period of time
Most of it bad but still very interesting
I know the words to only the Welsh anthem
I know the British (English) anthem but I don’t know the lyrics
This is the same for Ireland’s anthem(s), Scotland’s, Italy’s and France’s. I have heard the Spanish and German ones a few times but I doubt I could pick them out
I only hear them at sporting events and that’s usually watching the 6 Nations, hence how I know those 6 the most
Years of watching Schumacher and Ferrari dominate the sport have just left me confused now
I hear the German anthem and expect the Italian one to immediately follow it :P
I came here to say this
>Just realised essentially that’s every country in the rugby 6 nations
On that basis - tricky question time - what about *Ireland's Call*?
> Sorry lads but GSTQ is a bit of a bore
I'm increasingly of the opinion that England should adopt *Jerusalem* for sporting events
Using GSTQ in matches where they're playing Scotland, Wales or NI always seems a bit 'odd' to me as it's the UK's anthem
Some North Wales accents sound really odd to me
My mum was once in north Wales with work and a guy passed and said what sounded to here like “pishy dayguls
” He repeated it a bit and they eventually worked it out as “Busy day girls
”. I’ve never not understood but I do have to listen a bit more
North Welsh in Welsh is even harder for me since I’m not even fluent in the South Welsh dialect
I wouldn’t really count that though
This is hilarious to me (North Walean), I have come a cropper a few times in work when I've spoken Welsh to South Waleans and we both end up looking blankly at each other and then switching to English
I think the funniest difference is “nawr” and “rwan” for now
How can they literally be the same but backwards
What happened here lol
Don’t get people started on llaeth vs llefrith either
Llefrith/llaeth and cacen/teisen
I live in South Wales and the last time I saw snow that stuck to the ground in my city was 2011 but it snows every year on higher ground
Most young people here are atheists or at least not very religious
It’s rare you find an actually religious young person, and sometimes they are viewed as a bit weird
There are a few people who believe in god and such, but they aren’t like super devoted and follow every rule
Older people are more likely to be religious but most are fine with atheists
I think perhaps my Irish Catholic Nanna would be upset if she found out I was atheist, but more in a worried about me way rather than an angry way
Plus even though she cares a lot about religion (travelling to holy sites, church every Sunday), she came with us to a gay wedding so it’s clearly not that simple with her
I have no plan to tell her I’m atheist as all I have to do at the minute is sometimes go to church once a year when I’m Ireland, plus I do find church an interesting experience to listen to, even if I don’t believe it all
On the rise, [around 32% of people who responded to the 2011 UK Census] here in Wales stated they have 'no religion'.
They write themselves at the minute
Which one Boris(PM) or Mark(AM)
First off, we joke he sucks english pp, or where I'm from we do, second off, AM stands for assembly minister, basically Wales' PM
I never knew this
should we be pronouncing it like sean connery
Welsh - when I meet someone new and tell them I'm Welsh, their first question is always if I speak Welsh, I'm always embarrassed that I have to say no
I've been trying during lockdown to learn it, and I'm making progress
I'm able to say a lot more in Welsh now than previously but I'm not at the point where I could hold a conversation in Welsh yet
Hungarian - I visited Budapest just before Christmas last year and absolutely loved it
I'd love to go back and see the less touristy and less cosmopolitan parts of the country, and being able to speak the language would be a great help with that
Dutch - of all the countries I've visited the Netherlands is the one I've spent the most time in apart from the ones where I speak the language (ie apart from the UK and Germany)
I know the Dutch speak ridiculously good English but still, I think its a cool language, and its a good half way point between my 1st and 2nd languages (English and German)
Diolch yn fawr
I never understand why people want to learn Welsh, I hardly know anyone who speaks it
Learning Spanish currently, it's hard but I am enjoying it
I have never seen anything so funny as Germans in Majorca , who hardly speak any English, trying to order drinks in English to Spanish bar staff who hardly speak any English, it's something to behold
I am old and I go to areas full of other old people,  so am really talking about middle aged Germans, not the young
It must be hard though, I have given up with my wife (who speaks no Spanish) going to the bar, it's just too much trouble .
Most pubs here are only licensed till 11 or midnight outside of cities
The only way to stay later is if you know the landlord and they do a “lock-in” which essentially means you are just drinking in their house, so as long as they don’t take payments (outside of licensing hours) then it’s fine
Pubs in cities stay open later, but they’re usually a bit less chilled than a classic pub
This totally depends on age and event for me
As a student, and someone who has a couple of friends who don’t drink, at the pub you might arrive with 3 friends, meet 2 more later, one leaves halfway through, and throughout people you sorta know are coming and going and everyone is drinking at different paces
If you start paying rounds, someone at some point is going to get screwed over
It’s not uncommon to pair up or even do a 3 but I don’t think I’ve ever been in a whole group round at uni
If I’m at the pub at home, with family or friends, it’s usually a lot clearer who is staying for how long and rounds are done
Pubs and nightclubs can refuse anyone service and they don’t really have to give the individual any reason why
Of course it’s polite to
I’ve worked at a pub and club
In the club it was usually if someone is too drunk, so you write it down in a refusal book, so that if they are found ill or worse later on it doesn’t end up as your fault
You aren’t allowed to refuse service based on anything other than behaviour or action, but you also don’t have to give your reason so it’s still technically possible
[Here’s ] an article about it
Nightclubs do this and some more bar-y places but I don’t know of any classic pubs that do this, classic pubs the landlord lives upstairs so if they were open till 3/4 and then opening at 11 that would be some painful hours, though it’s not unheard of that some lock-ins with locals lead to this
I would write their name and the reason, the customer would likely be unaware that this exists, it’s just for legal reasons so that we don’t get in trouble for serving an obviously drunk person
If you refuse for other reasons it’s just evidence to your boss that you are refusing for genuine reasons, like violence or refusing to pay etc
The only place I’ve seen armed police outside of London and airports was at [The Royal Welsh Show] As it is royal-endorsed, there’s typically a member of the royal family present, and as such there are a few armed police patrolling
It’s a little surreal though, walking through huge pig, sheep and cow barns, only to see 4 armed police offers
Or watching a horse jumping competition etc
I've once seen armed police in my city
I walked into the train station and there was a policeman with a big gun
I was only going to use the cashpoint there so walked straight out and to a different cashpoint
It was because Obama was visiting the next city, not even anywhere near us
Local police once took down an armed hostage taker with a taser, dressing up as chefs delivering food
We were taught Australia, New Zealand and the surrounding islands as being the continent ‘Australasia’ rather than ‘Eurasia’
Out of curiosity, why would Eurasia be one continent, but Afro-Eurasia not
Varies
Went cycling from Newport to Pontypool and apart from some crossings and residential, all canal towpath and cycle lanes
But going around cities are usually shite
NationalCycleNetwork has the proper map
Cardiff: Nonexistent
There's a few useless strips of paint here and there
Also a few equally useless "shared cycleways" which are just pavements you're allowed to cycle on
Not good
Too hilly here so not many people cycle casually
Non casual cyclists have to go on the road
Usually takes place at my grandparents house (mum's side) or in a pub (dad's side)
Mum's side: everyone will have a buffet style dinner, the women stay at the table and chat, them men go downstairs and drink some beers while watching something on the TV (usually football or cricket)
The children occupy the space in between (my grandparents have a relatively large house so plenty of room for all)
Dad's side: begins relatively civil with chatter over a few drinks
Rapidly decends into chaos as we get more drunk
"Lle i bopeth a phopeth yn ei le"
simply means
"A place for everything and everything in its place", the sort of phrase you'd see on a twee plaque made by an anally-retentive shed owner
But it perfectly shows the weirdness of Welsh mutation where words which start with certain consonants change depending on grammar rules and other words preceding them
The word for 'everything' can be popeth, bopeth, phopeth or mhopeth in different situations
It can make looking words up in the dictionary tricky but it's cool how your brain adapts to choosing the right one naturally
English:
One-one was a racehorse, one-two was one too
One-one won one race, one-two won one too
Owain Glyndwr
Nye Bevan
Maybe Boudicca if you want to count her
We don't really cover much Welsh history at all, particularly ignoring the medieval period when Wales had more of it's own history (as opposed to being part of English history)
Happens to quite a few British tourists here in Southeast Asia, particularly places like Pattaya
Mix hopeless fuckers with balcony and the result lands on the pavement, I guess
That's an interesting observation actually, because traditionally Welsh speakers have compared English's poetic ability to that of a cawing of a crow lmao
Not a quote but I'll add it anyway because it always makes me laugh
Wales had just battered England 30-3 in the rugby (one of our biggest ever wins over them), at full time they go back to the pitch side pundits, who are known for being biased towards England
[Have a guess which one of the pundits is Welsh]
That may be so but they always find an excuse to talk about England
I don't really see why its necessary to have an English pundit at Wales vs Italy or Scotland vs France but there always seems to be one
BBC's format for the 6 Nations tends to be Inverdale/ Gabby Logan, 1 English pundit and 1 pundit from each country playing (unless England are playing then its 2 English pundits)
Surely they could just not have the extra English pundit and keep it to Inverdale/ Logan + 1 pundit for each country playing
When I was growing up in the 80s and 90s it was seen as a third world, poverty stricken, shitpool of Europe
Somewhere to send aid parcels to when there were no problems in Africa
&#x200B;
Nowadays it's average GDP per capita means they should be sending aid parcels and support to where I grew up
There's still a lot of lingering views of Romania from my generation of the same poverty stricken hole as they once were, although I suspect younger Redditors would have a more favourable view of the country
&#x200B;
On the other side, I knew two brothers from Romania when playing an MMO and they shared a brain cell between them
There are several medieval castles in North-east Wales, however due to their proximity with the English border, many were destroyed in battles against English forces in the late 13th century, particularly [Ewloe] [Caergwrle] and [Hawarden]
[Flint Castle] is reasonably well preserved, but you have to look further west to [Rhuddlan] or south to [Chirk] to find the region's best surviving castles
The [Newport Transporter Bridge] there are fewer than 10 in the world and only 2 in the UK (the other being in Middlesbrough)
It still works too
Hopefully our infrastructure would improve massively - but at the cost of much of North Wales becoming urbanised
Meanwhile, us 750,000 who moved down South are now drowning in motorways and electric trains
Yes
I'd forgotten that - the Welsh spoken in North Wales is a different dialect to that spoken in South Wales
> Midlands erasure is real
Erasure are from London though
On a few nights out in Bristol they put a plastic urinal thing like from a festival out on the street so people piss in that rather than on the street
It’s quite publicly located but no one seems to care, it’s well used
People regularly go down quiet alleys if they’re drunk or there’s no toilets nearby
It’s frowned upon but most people would get away with it
I'm not sure shocked is the right word, but people always seem surprised when all our worded road signs are in English and Welsh
Personally my family doesn't do that but it doesn't sound too outlandish, surprised that people find it weird
I thought most recent UK windows are double glazed
I rarely come across a single pane window, though perhaps that might be because I'm quite well off
I don't think we even have them *here*, it's just an American thing as far as I know
We don’t really have them in the UK either, they’re a US thing not an English thing
We don’t test for spelling beyond like age 8 - you’re just sort of expected to be able to spell things
But idk it’s been a while since I was in school so I don’t remember completely
Yeah Same for us too
Whilst I’d call English the Primary language in Wales, Welsh is a mostly phonetic language
(However there are sometimes some pesky double letters like “diwydiannau”. “n” and “nn” are the same)
I disagree, French spelling follows its own rules and has a logical flow unlike English
I've avoided flying the last few times I've visited Ireland from Wales
The train connections to Anglesey and Fishguard are shockingly bad, it's like going back in time
In summer 2019 I travelled from Belfast to Swansea in one interminable day by train and ferry
The Enterprise running from Belfast to Dublin was the only part that went smoothly
I've noticed that that ticket is no longer available to buy and am not sure if it's because connections are too unreliable or because of Brexit
I'm 158 miles from Dublin and really wish the non flying option was a lot quicker
Only 2 hours on the train to Paris
Takes me longer to get back home to Wales
(London)
I think you can still get the idea though right
Like Europe is old and small but America is young and big
So travelling 100 miles in Europe means another language/country/culture, but a 100 year old building isn’t really remarkable
I hope it's temporary as it's good to have one ticket for the whole journey in case of delays
The SailRail tickets are a long standing affordable option and I'd hate to lose them
Paris or Amsterdam would still be a 75ish min flight from Newcastle or Glasgow
Maybe because of the language thing
I'm Welsh and don't feel that way at all, we're used to dual languages
Edit: I'm not trying to be confrontational here, I just want everyone to love travel as much as me ;-)
Well, I actually am Welsh and whilst I'm first language English, everyone can understand and speak more than anyone from over the border would think
Most of our place names are in Welsh, for example, and everyone learns it up till 16
I'm not sure why you felt the need to try to tell me about how I, and all of my compatriots, understand our own language
Probably more common with older people, bakestones
Thick bit of metal you put over a stove top to make welshcakes
They are
Stodgy, sweet goodness
Proper ones have raisins and sultanas in, but you can get chocolate chip, jam, all sorts
If you ever come to Wales, find the welshcake stand in the town/city's local market and get some warm
Yeah - also British Italian checking in
What I've seen is what you suggest and also a decline in cooking ability in Italy
E.g. My Nonna was an excellent cook, but my Italian cousins don't show much interest
I did a free online city design module from the US where I had to identify the grid and the axis in my city
There really isn't a grid or an axis here
I get frustrated walking in US and Canadian cities that I've visited because I always looking for a diagonal shortcut that doesn't exist
It took me a while to understand what zoning meant and was puzzled why people couldn't just live near work and shops
And I was an adult when I first played Sim City
I agree
My Dad is a lifelong Labour voter and although he did eventually vote Labour in 2019 he said he was very close to not bothering voting at all for the first time in his life
Personally at the UK level I feel very disenfranchised
I live in a safe tory seat, and I am seriously wondering if theres any point voting anymore in Westminster elections at all, as things stand right now I probably won't.
Welsh Parliament elections are different as they use a more proportional system, so I actually feel like my vote does count for something
There’s many primary and secondary schools that are 100% in Welsh (beside English lessons)
All of us from the start of school to the end of GCSEs study Welsh as a lesson, but in English medium schools this is usually fairly poorly taught
Every child is within the catchment of one Welsh-medium primary and secondary school by law, I believe
So anyone is afforded the opportunity to have their kids grow up fluent in Welsh, and often these schools are the better ones in the area
I think the intention is to slowly move more schools to be Welsh medium, but it’s obviously limited by the number of Welsh speaking teachers
It’s certainly a success in terms of resurgence but it’s still on a knife’s edge as there are a lot of people with huge biases against it and who have no idea of the history as to why we don’t all speak it
If at school they’d taught us about the Welsh not, the violence, the blue books, the forced destruction of our language, we would be a lot more passionate about learning it when we had the chance, sadly they just have to teach us what we need to get through an exam
So it’s a lesson everyone ends up hating and sometimes their parents biases are laid into them as well such as “pointless language”, “dead language” or “I’m English so there’s no point”, “not a useful language” etc
Depends where you are but my school was roughly a quarter to a third English, some people had two English parents and considered themselves Welsh because they grew up there, some considered themselves English
Then there were kids who’d moved to Wales when they’re like 12 and they were typically the ones more likely to say that
I believe one quote was “Wales is a shit country anyway and I’m not coming back once I grow up so there’s no point”. Lots of fun
I used to live in a large city in England and my partner in a very rural area, she would drive around country lanes very fast, literally 20 mph faster than I could, I could never understand it, but, when she visited the city and was driving, it was like being driven by a learner driver, so my guess is it's just experience, which I suppose is obvious in hindsight
Bread of Heaven or Delilah
What else could make us Welsh rugby fans feel more patriotic than singing about how Tom Jones killed his lady
Wales comes from Germanic origins and means (approximately) "foreigners". So by calling ourselves Welsh we are also calling ourselves foreigners
In contrast the Welsh word for Wales (Cymru) comes from ancient Brythonic and means (approximately) fellow countrymen
In terms of actual place names, [Newtown] in mid-Wales is a little 'odd'.
First settled in the 13th century, it was only designated as a [new town] in the 1960s, when more well-known new towns like Milton Keynes, Stevenage and Hemel Hempstead in England were all being built
Wow I didn't know that
I knew there were other places that shared the etymology of Wales (eg Wallonia and somewhere in Switzerland I think) but I would have never thought Italy would be one of them
On a related note, I can think of three Newports off the top of my head
One is about 900 years old, one is about 700, and the third is 90 miles inland
David Walliams and Matt Lucas want to know your location
Or do Whales just like Wales a lot
Its debated both ways, nobody knows for sure but both meanings are similar
Foreigner is the more common knowledge translation here
Love that idea, lets do it haha
I'm not sure, but IIRC the last time this came up there were 2 Newport in Wales alone
I'm not sure but it's pretty ironic given that UK government was actively trying to eradicate Welsh language until not too long ago
Welsh won't die out
It currently has official status from the UK government and if any attempt was made to remove that there would be outrage and calls for independence
That alone should be enough to keep it around in the future
Unified foreign policy and monetary policy is also important
You can't be a union if every decision you make is vetoed by Malta
Inviting the Anglo-Saxons over after the fall of Rome
Inviting some Germans over as mercenaries to fight the Picts
Great job, Vortigern, you dick
This is definitely our worst mistake
Didn’t even realise that this didn’t happen in more places (despite actually knowing how and why my brain just didn’t click until like 4 years ago)
I’m at 51
5 degrees
It only bothers me when I’m working a long day and leave the house in the dark and return in the dark, but as a student at the minute I have time when the sun is up to do things
The sun rises around 8:15 and sets around 16:00, this is considerably longer than 10 degrees further north
It’s never really bothered me, it might do further north where there’s only 2-3 hours of sunlight, but I feel like the summer makes up for that with late nights that are light
My American family find it crazy in summer when they come over and it’s light till around 22:00
I even remember visiting Munich (~48 degrees) this summer and listening to Americans enjoying the late light
It bothered me a bit this year, as I went to Malaga in Spain to visit a friend a week or so ago and it was light till 18:00/19:00, it’s just nice to be able to relax in the early evening and be outside
I’ve adjusted back now though
This didn’t happen to me, and it’s actually the opposite situation, but it’s still cool
Whenever I (and a fair few people from Wales), travel abroad, even though I don’t speak Welsh fluently, if I’m with someone else from Wales, I’ll occasionally speak Welsh, either if it’s to keep something a secret or to stop people trying to get you to buy something/come to their restaurant
They ask if you speak English and you say “Na, dw i’n sîarad Gymraeg” and they give up
So this Welsh couple were on holiday in Greece (not sure where exactly), and a restaurant owner tries to get them to come in, they do this exact thing only for him to reply in Welsh
Turns out he’d lived there for years and his wife was Welsh and a Welsh speaker
So they did go to his restaurant and ended up having a great time
We're within 20 minutes of [Erddig Hall] in North Wales

Other stone circles exist, I was really impressed with the Callanais Stones on the Isle of Lewis
>Or we say "een o-li-fant, twee o-li-fant, drie o-li-fant" ( one elephant, two elephant)
That's what I learned as a kid in Wales (in English)
I have a weird habit where I don't drink tap water in foreign countries (and by foreign countries I mean every country that's not Wales)
I should probably try and get over it tbh, it'd be cheaper
Most European countries aren't innocent, but one of the few that is is Wales
Though that might be because since the Roman period we had our lands colonised and then after that were desperately trying to survive before being annexed by England 600 years ago, so we never really had a chance to do awful shit
Technically we were part of the British empire but that was mostly England and Scotland
Tbf wasn't Scotland (or the Scoti) actually an Irish clan who invaded and settled in the area of modern day Scotland
Everyone on this island can point at everyone else for something or other, no one is innocent (except the Manx probably, they seem pretty chill)
Due there is a reason all evil empires in films have an rp accent, Britain is the go to for evil empires
Wilkinson Sword in the UK used to make scissors but were bought out by Fiskars and think made them on license
My Grandad was production manager for Wilkinson Sword in Bridgend and pretty sure my nan still has some scissors that look like that, but with Wilkinson Sword logo on them
They still make razor blades/shaving stuff and think gardening tools
I dunno, I guess we'd have to put our women on alert just incase the French try to invade Wales again
Other than that nowt would change
Absolutely fuck all my dude, well as far as i am aware
Ah yes

How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man
For Wales, definitely a castle, probably Caernarfon
The bridges over the canals can be a bit steep
Wales was a series of independent states from when Magnus Maximus withdrew Roman troops from Wales between 383 and 410
So could be called independent/free
These were unified into one Welsh state by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in 1057
This state lasted until the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd (or Llywelyn the last) in  1284, in war with the English, which resulted in the full annexation of Wales, with the Statute of Rhuddlan
There’s a story that the English king said Wales would always have a prince who speaks not a word of English, and then gave that title to his infant son
(So around 890-930 years)
Owain Glyndwr led a rebellion in 1400
During which Wales’ sovereignty was recognised by both Scotland and France (I believe), and was somewhat independent of England for a few years
The last stronghold falling in 1409, but Glyndwr was never found so he now has sort of a myth that he’ll return if/when Wales is threatened
(So a maximum of 9 years really, more like 1/2 in reality)
Wales was still somewhat legally different to England until 1535 and 1542 when the Laws in Wales acts forced English laws and customs on all of Wales, though also provided Wales with parliamentary representation
It also prevented Welsh being used in court and public office, anglicising the gentry of Wales
Since then we have been a subject of England essentially, though over the years steps have been made to make us an equal, whether or not that’s true is debatable, but we received devolution in 1998, so if you consider that free, then 1998-now
Edit:Typos
If you're talking about Wales then probably 410 (fall of rome) - 1283 (final conquest by the english)
If you're talking about any state on the island of Britain then 927 - today
Unless you count rule by non-british kings in which case it's closer to 1485 - today (with brief periods of british rule before the Norman conquest)
Personally I don't consider a people group native to a land unless they've been there for about 500 years
So by that metric the English are considered foreigners until the 10th century
Now though, they are just as native as the rest of us
Does the Kievan rus count
It sounds like it was centred on Kiev, so wouldn't that mean it was also centred on Ukraine
Relevant username
Not really
We were ruled by Danes for a lot of that time
1485 - today is better
From 1485 - 1689 we were ruled by native Britons
From 1689 - today we were ruled by a combination of Dutch and Germans, but due to the glorious revolution their power was extremely limited (even more so after George III) and Britain was de facto rules by native Britons, at first in an oligarchy and then in a democracy
It got to number one in the itunes singles download chart and something like 30 in the actually official weekly one I believe

Still cool though
Liege
It was okay but I thought it would be a bit better than it was
Didn't help that on the day I went there was big construction works causing disruption on the trains from Germany so it took me about twice as long to get there than it should have
They used to be, but then they all got bombed in the war and rebuilt in the 60s/ 70s
Yeah they were rebuilt with ugly 60s/ 70s architecture
Coventry for example used to be an ancient medieval city but it was almost completely destroyed in one night in November 1940
Now its full of ugly concrete buildings from the 60s.
It would be nice if they did but it would cost way too much and cause too much disruption
When I worked at a quiet pub in a small village the bartender told me to ID anyone who asked that question because chances are they were young and looking for a cheap way to get drunk
It’s weird for the bartender to have been rude like that though, it’s entirely up to the customer what they ask for, and sure it might make you make a mental judgement but it’s none of your business really
I don’t like doing it because it feels weird to out myself as drinking to get drunk, but I did it a lot when I’d just turned 18
I usually now just get what I want to have and pay the extra 30-50p per pint/drink I’m especially going to do this post-coronavirus
This isn’t a universal UK thing
What’s happened is you’ve been to an upper class establishment where you’re expected to spend or at least pretend you can
The difference between the UK and Canada is that the class divide is more pronounced here
I think the London aspect is the missing piece here, not anything about British culture in general
If you’re stepping into an upmarket, low-light bar in Sloane Square then there’s going to be an uncomfortable snobbery
I don’t think it’s justified, but you can guess it would happen
If you did the same thing in Darlington with a sense of humour, I think it’s 50/50 on whether they’d humour you or think you’re taking the piss
I don’t know, depends if the person at the bar takes any sort of commission, which I don’t think is common
Still, I think your analysis does add something, and the Mitchell and Webb sketch is a funny one that I happened to watch the other day
In the Welsh alphabet it’s pronounced “aets”, slightly similar to if I said “eights” in English
It’s pronounced the same as in English on its own, like the h in hat
If it’s in a ch then it becomes like Scottish loch or Yiddish chutzpah
If it’s in an nh then it becomes nasal
If it’s after a t it is like an English voiced th
(the unvoiced equivalent is written as dd)
If it’s rh then it’s voiceless and trilled, so like the r in pretty but trilled
If it’s in an ngh then that’s an ung sort of sound at the back of your throat, but also nasal
It’s a voiceless velar nasal according to the internet
It can also be present in a ph which makes an f sound like English (an Ff sound in Welsh since a single f is equivalent to an English v)
Edit: A is pronounced as “ah”
Belarus and Turkey with their current governments
I dunno about countries per say but there are definitely some European cities I'd avoid, Paris for one, not so much due to the city itself although it apparently does stink of pee
It would be due to parisians and their famous attitude problem
Similarly Barcelona, as it reportedly has a problem with pick pockets
But countries
I don't think there would be a country I wouldn't visit
Isn't that a decision made at a local goverment level though
It may not be representative of Poland at a state level
Still it's a incredibly shitty thing to do though in my opinion
Is it
I've seen some good answers on here
Especially concerning Turkey, Poland and Russia
Personally I'd say Cardiff is better than both London and Paris
But then again I may just be biased
Deus vult
Well Russia and Poland aren't very welcoming to LGBTA+ people and Turkey is currently on the verge of starting off a regional conflict against Russia
So yeah
Despite your points I'd still rather avoid them, just saying
Jesus isn't a prophet in Christianity but he is in Islam
In the most basic sense he is a prophet, but because Christians see him as God in the flesh his status as a prophet is not his not the primary focus
So while he's 'technically' a prophet, you won't find him in lists of Christian prophets
Christians wouldn't say "the prophet Jesus" whereas Muslims would, though both see him as the Messiah
Some Christians consider Malachi (before Jesus) to be the last prophet (implying Jesus was not to be considered a prophet in the strictest sense), some see John the Baptist (contemporary to Jesus) to be the last, some consider the author of the Book of Revelation (after Jesus) to be the last
Generally the end of prophethood is kind of implicit/assumed in Christianity though
In Islam it's much more straight forward – Muhammad was the last prophet and that's that
In order to be a prophet you need to be a messenger for God and make prophecies (which come true)
Obviously this has lead to a whole bunch of (largely peripheral) sectarian arguments over who is a prophet and who isn't.
I literally found out about it from this post, so it's safe to say no
Wales is much the same as the rest of the UK
No equivalent to the Gendarmerie
There are 4 regional police forces - North Wales Police, Dyfed Powys Police, South Wales Police and Gwent Police
There are large rural areas in both the [North Wales] and [Dyfed Powys] police force areas, and they have dedicated rural crime teams
Otherwise we've got the same 'specialist' police forces as the rest of the UK - the British Transport Police (railways), Military Police and Civil Nuclear Constabulary have all been mentioned already
I'm in Llangrallo (Coychurch), a village in pen--y-bont ar Ogwr (Bridgend)
Llan which is a common in place names means church
However it's more like church or parish of, as the proper translation for church is Eglwys
The church was built after St Crallo, but with the mutation the C turns to a G. So Llangrallo means church of St Crallo
Pen-y-bont means the end of the bridge and Ogwr is the river Ogmore running through the middle of town
The original bridge is still there along with a few new ones
I live near to Cwmbrân, Torfaen
Cwmbrân translates into English as "Valley of the crows". While my county, Torfaen, means "breaker of stones" and is a reference to the river that runs through the Valley
There isn't much history for these names as they are both new creations
Cwmbran is a new town, so the entire town was built after WW2, while Torfaen has only existed since the 1990s.
Historically the entire area was part of Gwent, which gets its name from the Roman built town for the Silures tribe, who were the celtic tribe that lived in this area, which was called Venta Silurum ("Market of the Silures" in English)
Venta is now the town of Caerwent meaning "Fortress of Gwent".
Cardiff, Swansea, Aberystwyth and Bangor are the main ones
I just had a look at the Grauniad university guide for the first time in a decade and the Welsh unis place:
31st - Swansea
38th - Cardiff
54th - Aberystwyth
57th - Trinity St David
78th - Bangor
98th - South Wales
112th - Glyndwr
113rd - Cardiff Met
Out of 121 total
Bit depressing, that

(Valleys) Welsh here
I had to learn to speak clearly, with English instead of Welsh grammar, syntax and words when I first got a job from Uni across the border
I'm a first language English speaker, or so I thought before moving
I know I have to speak properly to anyone who's not Welsh, but if I speak to anyone from home or have a few pints in me, I'm straight back to it though
The UK had an opt-out
I suspect we won’t get it back in the event of a “Brejoin”
Welsh cakes with butter, or just a dusting of sugar
The north/south might as well be divided like Korea
Sweden
Something about how the roads look, how the fluorescents hit the snow in dark winters, how the language sounds
I watched a lot of Swedish movies as a kid, and having spent so much time in Denmark I wanted to know what the neighbour was like
I was dead set on going to Stockholm
I knew nothing about the city, its size, how it looked; I just knew I wanted to go there
My favourite city I have ever been to
I’m hoping to move to Sweden next year
Would like a general EU issued passport with variations on the design based on region (iirc they already do this with the euro)
Just hope we end this madness before we leave and end up spending the next 2 decades trying to get back in
Ideally one saying "Gweriniaeth Cymru - Republic of Wales" but an EU one would be better than UK
Make sure that they leave plenty of room for national or "state" symbols
For example, a gold Welsh Dragon surrounded by EU stars on the front
Republic of the Britons
After 2000 years maybe it can become a reality
L'Internationale would probably piss off some eastern Europeans
Also it's French
In Welsh it is:
Pen, ysgwyddau, coesau, traed,
Coesau, traed,
Pen, ysgwyddau, coesau, traed,
Coesau, traed,
A llygaid, a clustiau, a trwyn a cheg,
Pen, ysgwyddau, coesau, traed,
Coesau, traed
Which is mostly similar to the English
It’s, heads shoulders legs feet, so no knees and no and
Then it’s and eyes and ears and nose and mouth
So a slight change in the order
The number of syllables matches  more closely this way, I assume that’s why the and is dropped
>make a more democratic system work
Honestly I don't blame you for this, it's a common portrayal
But one entirely incorrect
During the Interregnum there were 3 main periods of government
The first was the rump parliament, which consisted of MPs still remaining in Parliament after a number had been forcibly removed by the army
After a few years they tried to have new elections to replace the missing members and Cromwell shut them down
He replaced them with the Nominated Assmebly (/Barbon Parliament/Parliament of Saints) which was a parliament of men handpicked by him under the criteria of being "godly". After a couple of months they began to clash with Cromwell, so shockingly he forcibly dissolved them
Having had his first two systems fail, Ctomwell resorted to pure military dictatorship, ruling with all the powers of a king, but not the title
There were parliaments during this time to fulfil the traditional role of 'advising the monarch', but Cromwell frequently ignored them and even dissolved them again at one point
While Cromwell wasn't 100% evil, his stance on democracy is not where he is partially redeemed
I wish this comment was an automatic response whenever this is brought up
Anyone who knows anything about Cromwell knows he was tyranic, he's still a great figure
Imagine if every time Genghis Khan were brought up, people felt the need to point out he was a nasty bloke
About €160, but I get a lot of takeaway food so I could decrease that by quite a lot if I had any willpower

I'm just going to assume this was an Autocorrect fail or something
I've seen plenty of people make that same mistake on Reddit
Eh, I've seen the same mistake often enough
I suspect most phones aren't intelligent enough to understand context in sentences and shit, so I can see why they would try and correct the phrase "Prince of Wales".
Haha, no worries
Like I said you see it a lot on here so I'm not bothered by it now
Yeah that makes sense
Good point
That's probably the most likely explanation, sadly
Germany/ Austria - easily
Everywhere else - couldn't do it

England are usually the butt of our jokes
(wasn't a similar question asked like 2 days ago
England
Just like the Irish, and the Scots, and the French, and the Germans, and the Spanish, and the Australians, and the New Zealanders, and the South Africans etc etc etc
&#x200B;
I can't remember any specific jokes, but it's mostly about their perceived self-righteousness and how they're viewed from the rest of Europe
My small ~1,000 population village that I grew up in, perfectly fine, chances are if the pub isn’t open you won’t pass anyone, which I guess can make you feel unsafe in a different sort of way
Cardiff definitely has some sketchy alleys and areas, if you aren’t a local you might get targeted but I’m a tall guy and the most I’ve had is some homeless people asking for money, which isn’t particularly threatening to me
If it’s a weekend night there’s hordes of drunk people, but if you just keep your head down and pass by they won’t even register you
Again, could be different for a woman sadly
Walking with female friends in this situation they have been both groped and spat on
Both by the same sort of guy
I did give them a piece of my mind but they obviously don’t really care, plus I’m not really one to get in a fight but those were probably the closest I’ve come to it
All my experiences with walking at night in Cardiff have been right in the city centre though, no quieter areas
Bristol is not too different to Cardiff in areas
There’s some areas that I’d say are perfectly safe at all hours, then others that have one or two sketchy people walking about but they’re more likely to start a weird conversation and just make you uncomfortable more than threaten violence
I’d say there’s around 1/3rd of the city that seems safe based on mine and my female friends testimonies
I live in London
I mover here aged 23 and have wandered most areas at night for the last 20 years
I've never had a problem
I was pickpocketed on a bus once
Apart from that nothing
I've never felt unsafe, even in so called unsafe areas
However, I've had all the usual stupidity women get from men
Not usually so much any more
And apart from comments nothing in the streets, bit touching etc on buses and in bars
But that said I am white, an adult and while being a woman brings its own set of problems it probably also protects me from other stuff
So it's relatively safe for me, but I wouldn't be a young, black man in some areas
Like Ireland, we have a Harp as our National Symbol
The harps are different, however
The "Welsh Harp/Triple Harp" has 3 rows of strings in comparison to the usual 1
Pretty sure ours is the same thing
And if not then I guess I’d say our voices
You seem much more in the know about Welsh music than I am about Irish
You’re name reminded me of something actually that’s only partly related
My sister was in The [Eurovision Choir contest] last year in Gothenburg and I was gonna say maybe that proves your point but my sister’s also a harpist so maybe she’s not the best example to use haha
Yeah I think you’re right there
I probably don’t have the best POV as my family’s pretty musical but I think in general it’s not exactly a go to genre for many people
Join couch surfing and hang out with locals during your stay
That we are overrun by muslims and don't have freedoms
That we don't need to drive because we have good public transport everywhere
My village has one bus route between the 2 towns either side of it, it runs hourly for about 13 hours a day, 6 days a week
No buses anywhere after 1920 in the evening, and nothing on Sundays
There is a train service, again it's only hourly
Even going anywhere reasonably 'local' like Chester, Liverpool or Manchester requires at least one change of train
We've always perpetuated that idea ourselves though, mainly because travelling to 'Europe' involves a ferry crossing, flight, or more recently, a train journey
oui
I heard Chinese businesses pay white men to be living furniture to make the business seem better or more multicultural than it is
Some of them even sit in meetings

A lovely townhouse really
[For example] My family house cost us around £120,000, and our one before that my parents bought for £60,000 or so when I was born
A house like the one linked is not very achievable for people in my area, you’d need at least 10% deposit and need to pay a lot per month on a mortgage
I went to Munich in summer 2019 and had a brilliant time
Went to all those spots
Got the train down to one of the nearby lakes
Would go to the area any time again, didn’t feel like I got “tourist trapped” at all apart from watching that clock in the centre but that was free anyway so I didn’t really mind
Spoke to a few locals too and everyone was super helpful
Welsh animals have a few of these literal names
Hamster is “bochdew”, literallly fat-cheek
Fox can be “llwynog”, literally bushy
Hedgehog is “draenog”, literally thorny
Caterpillar is “sîani flewog”, literally furry Jenny
Ladybird is “buwch goch gotta”, literally small red cow
Turtle is “crwban”, literally little hump
Squid is “môr-lawes”, literally sea-sleeve
Dragonfly is “gwas y neidr”, literally snake’s servant
And as I said in my other comment jellyfish can be
“Pysgod wibli wobli”, literally wibbly wobbly fish or “cont y môr”, c*nt of the sea
There is a more formal name but it’s not as fun
Two Welsh terms for Jellyfish are “Pysgod wibli wobli” (for kids), meaning wibbly wobbly fish, and “Cont y môr” which is c*nt of the sea
Well, I think the actual word is meicrodon but there’s the jokey one popty-ping
Think it’s along the lines of calling a tv remote something like a flicker etc
Edit:Typo
I think the standard word for it is “Sglefren fôr” which is sort of like slippery sea thing
Those two are used in colloquial speech
I’m not fluent though, and I have also heard that a lot of animals in Welsh have many dialectal names, so there could easily be another 2 or 3 words for jellyfish, just picked the two most interesting
Additionally, I wonder how often jellyfish comes up in a formal/polite setting, documentaries perhaps

Cons: unstable and chaotic politics, very high cost of living, employment drought (especially compared to the UK), summers are painfully hot, culture of misogyny can be very pervasive, overcrowded public transport, weird accents

Yeah, I'm a guy and about half of my friends are female
Its completely normal especially once you get into your late teens/ early twenties and beyond
It's quite difficult to define when Wales was founded, as Wales was a collective of regions ruled by princes
However, the first person to unify all of Wales and become the first Prince of Wales was Gruffydd ap Llewellyn, also known as Llewellyn the Great, in 1055, and was first recognised by the English to be the King of Wales, which is seen to be the date that Wales was founded
Iran just has OP geography
If we were buying drywall most builders merchants and DIY stores in the UK would deliver those sort of items to your house
If we needed to move a couch or similar we know several people with vans, as others have said you could also hire one for a day, there are van rental companies everywhere in the UK too
If you are ordering a large enough amount it’s almost always delivered
We do have a trailer as well that we’ve used for sand
It’s just not feasible to drive a pickup around since they cost so much more to run, and take up so much space
I don’t think we could even park anywhere in my town really
We also know some people who would lend us a van, which are far more space efficient
Old towns and cities rarely have spaces that pickup trucks can comfortable operate on
We have one drywall wall in our house that we had to put in ourselves
It was delivered to our house
It’s not a functional building material here, and I finally understood how Americans “punch holes in walls” only around a year ago
Of course it’s a viable building material when you are in certain conditions, but as others have said, most houses here are 70s and earlier
Mine is 1950s. I wouldn’t like to think what a piece of drywall would look like after 70 years, especially when this house was unoccupied for over 5 of them
Sort of, we had some mandatory “Home Economics” lessons for 3 years in Secondary school
I remember making a salad, cake, pasta thing and maybe a pizza
There was an option to continue this into a Catering and Hospitality qualification but I didn’t.
Having moved to uni I have learned to cook a lot more things, and looking at some peoples cooking ability who I’ve lived with, makes me think perhaps more lessons or needed
We had to make smoothies and stuff like that in secondary school, but it didn't help me
I still can't cook anything that isn't "just stick it in the oven and wait half an hour"
IIRC, Home Economics was part of our Design Technology 'rotation', so we'd do maybe half a term of it then swap to woodwork and so on
It was an optional subject past Year 9 (ages 13 - 14) and I don't think a single boy took it then
I dropped all of them, I'm not the most practical sort
I was at school in the 90s so I don't think we really had an equivalent of IT
It was the first half of the 90s so the computers were all old Apple Macs, no copies of Word here
Ah, the place I work at now has fitted wifi everywhere, and departments that need their own computers have to buy their own laptops and trollies to keep them in
The kids find new and fun(!) ways to fuck the laptops up every other week :(
We had a PC in every classroom over 10 years ago, IIRC
Now, when I was at school all registers were still paper, lol

Those who speak a minority language/dialect, where's the most unusual place (real or digital) you've seen your language
This doesn't include English, French, German, Spanish or Italian but doesn't **exclude** them e.g. if you find French graffiti in a toilet in a shitty area in a city in the Brazilian interior, that would be unusual

No offense meant by this, but if his voters aren't racist, why do they vote for a politician with racist views and policies
Like here the vast majority of voters for BXP, ou populist hard right party are either racists or nationalists are usually proud
I guess it depends where you are
In the south and South Wales I don’t hear it very often
Seems to get more common the further north aha
Scottish people and northerners seem to shy away from it less
Also while it’s still a harsh swearword (to my ears) I definitely hear it thrown around more as a genuine insult more than in America (when visiting and in media)
Better looking than our people ;)
I really should stop saying south like I know the whole south
Only been to London twice
I mean south/south west I suppose
Saying that, I can hear a Londoner saying it in my head now and think you might be right

Some people even write on the potatoes
I’ve been to a few more modern pubs here and they serve them as a side
Any decent tapas restaurant has croquetas here also
Only really known of them in the last ~3 years though
I think the difference is that a boterham doesn't have the top slice of bread - it's stuff *on* bread instead of *between* bread
Are they not croquettes which are the slightest bit different
Had them too mind
Wouldn't you
I think I'm going to have to Google this, because I can't see how differ-

That we were happy to be taken over and didn't exactly revolt against the new rule all too much, I s'pose
We're not the silent nation for sure
I think most people tend to note the difference between pseudo-democratic states with restricted suffrage but democracy and say absolutism
Also just a point, we still don't have universal suffrage
The voting age is 18

A few UK breweries will produce Christmas-themed beers, but there's nothing specific that I can think of
Beers like Shepherd Neame's [Christmas Ale] for example
I think Wychwood Brewery will produce a Christmas variant of their 'Hobgoblin' beer, too
I had some Christmas beer last year at a local pub, but I can’t remember any names
It was a red ale and it was some joke on Rudolph’s nose
It’s not classic in the UK but I think craft breweries are starting to get onboard as an reason to experiment
We had that last year, I've been wondering if they'll bring it back
Yeah, it's a good time for breweries to try some new beers out, they can experiment a bit
Tokyo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Toyota, Kobe, Sakai, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagasaki,  Bingo, Satsuma, Fukushima, Hiroshima, Nagoya, Ome, Awaji, Settsu, Kobe, Fuji, Suzuka
Theres probably a few candidates:
Boris Johnson (although he is also probably the most loved at the same time as being the most hated)
Daniel Kawczynski
Nigel Farage
Priti Patel
Jeremy Corbyn
Margaret Thatcher (hell will freeze over before people here forget what that woman did to Wales)
Not as much as in England but Labour did lose support here under him and the right hate him as much as in England
To be honest I just included him in case I got accused to being biased to the left haha
I like your version better than my idea of being a warning to others
I suspect we'll be sidelined in some areas but in others will continue to inevitably be part of our continent

Cromwell's relationship with Parliament was a tumultuous one
Let's never forget that he helped preside over a military purge of parliament (removal not murder of MPs) and then later when he was in charge he himself used to army to shut down Parliament and replace it with MPs he preferred 3 times
Ah, I see
not quite the response I guess the O.P was expecting but I can definitely see why ya might think that way
For Wales I'd say the circumstances surrounding [the death of Carl Sargeant] a Labour politician in November 2017 (full disclaimer; he represented my constituency)
He committed suicide after being dismissed from the Welsh Government following allegations around his personal conduct - basically his name came up when the #MeToo scandal hit UK politics in 2017
At the last count there were 3 inquiries ongoing following all this, into 1) his death, 2) if there was bullying in the Welsh Government, and 3) if the First Minister at the time, Carwyn Jones, breached the ministerial code when he sacked Mr Sargeant from the Welsh Government

Bus trains aren’t normal
\* Bus body on a 4-wheeled freight wagon chassis
150s are fine IMO - but yes, as they’ve installed accessible toilets on them recently they’ve lost maybe 12 seats in one carriage
In fact we’re about to get *two* lots of London’s cast-offs here in Wales
* Class 230s, rebuilt from [old London Underground trains]
* Class 769s, [old Thameslink trains] retro-fitted with Diesel engines
Me again
We exported most of the 141s [to *Iran*] Yes, Iran
They have since withdrawn them from service
Scotland's doing better than Wales in terms of rail at the moment, at least you guys get to decide which lines up there get electrified
We're reliant on the British Government who don't really give a shit about doing anything further west of Cardiff
Otherwise the main lines in the UK like the West and East Coast ones are pretty good, IMO
Technically the IoW order will be the third lot :P
The ones we're getting in Wales will be on my local line
The plan is for 3-car sets
The 2 cab cars will be fitted with battery packs and there will be 4 diesel gensets in the centre car
There is a vague plan to extend services to either Birkenhead or even Liverpool on battery power, with regenerative braking helping to recharge it during operation
Then have some kind of charging point installed at Wrexham General station
If they can pull it off it will massively improve services on my local line, especially if they can extend through to Liverpool
We don’t actually have electrified tracks in most of Wales, thanks to Westminster denying us that on several occasions despite our own government (and opposition) being in favour of it
Yes, the thinking from the British Government is that it avoids costly and disruptive elecxtrification schemes
In reality the first batch of these trains in running several months late as the conversion is delayed because it's harder than they thought
There are a few prototypes but they're not really running yet
Third rail electrification is not loved as it's massively inefficient compared to overhead, but bolting a Ford transit engine to a rebuilt D stock underground train is seen as easier any day of the week
The D stock is delayed as they make sure they don't catch fire and can work, the 769 programme is diababolical and is testament to why new build is better than modifying current stock
TfW, Northern and GWR train are late and no set time for delivery
Sticking to the original topic of the post, ordering food in Pete's Eats in Llanberis
North Wales so everyone speaks Welsh, managed to fumble my way through in what I've learned through Duolingo but heck, it's a whole new world
> The D stock is delayed as they make sure they don't catch fire and can work, the 769 programme is diababolical and is testament to why new build is better than modifying current stock
TfW, Northern and GWR train are late and no set time for delivery
Yeah, I can't help but think ordering more CAF units or FLIRTs instead of the 769s would have been better here in Wales
Or just keep the 175s instead - there don't seem to be any takers for them yet
At least our D-Stock will be battery hybrid ones
One of my biggest regrets is dropping Welsh as a subject circa 1994 or so when I chose my GCSE options - as you could do back then
Might jump on Duolingo and see how I go
In theory the 769 project is sound, but it's got to the point where if it was a dog it would be out down
The 175's are sound units and the refurb will see them through another 10 years
However they catch fire easily in the heat and I don't think anyone would want to have them
GCSE Welsh isn't bigged up in the right way to make people pay attention
When you've got a dozen other exams to do it sort of falls behind
Duolingo is class and highly recommend, stick at it you'll pick it back up easily
> The 175's are sound units and the refurb will see them through another 10 years
However they catch fire easily in the heat and I don't think anyone would want to have them
Precisely why we should keep them, IMO
Leave them on things like Holyhead - Cardiff and Holyhead - Manchester
Agree with you re: 769s too
> GCSE Welsh isn't bigged up in the right way to make people pay attention
When you've got a dozen other exams to do it sort of falls behind
It was optional before 1999 - German and French made more sense back then as Welsh hadn't really had the revival it had now

Electrified railways
We've only got Cardiff-Severn Tunnel electrified (30-40 miles), there were plans to take it to Swansea but they got postponed
by the government
Fully agreed on this - I'd also like better North - South transport links as I have family in Carmarthenshire
I look at Scotland with some envy - they have 4 lines between Edinburgh and Glasgow, and have electrified all of them
They have the power to carry out their own electrification, so add Stirling and Dunblane to that list
We couldn't even get the Government to electrify the line to our *second city*...
Meanwhile we have to pay for HS2, which I broadly support, but electrifying Cardiff - Swansea and the Valley Lines would have been a nice trade-off there
Me too
The valley lines are getting transferred to Transport for Wales and should all be electrified by 2023
(Otherwise the we lose the EU funding for it)
Support HS2 as well, probably a better trade off would be electrify Crewe-Chester-Holyhead
The Avanti services can switch to electric and direct link to HS2
Electrics to Swansea will happen, eventually
Mayo haters unite
> The valley lines are getting transferred to Transport for Wales and should all be electrified by 2023
(Otherwise the we lose the EU funding for it)
I thought that was just 2 or 3 lines north of Cardiff
>Support HS2 as well, probably a better trade off would be electrify Crewe-Chester-Holyhead
The Avanti services can switch to electric and direct link to HS2
I agree on that, too
Even just doing Crewe - Holyhead would help
I know there are a lot of bridges on Crewe - Chester but the new Hitachi trains can at least switch to diesel then
You are right sorry, I thought it was Barry and Penarth as well, just everything north of Cardiff Central
With the problems they've overcome wiring through the Severn Tunnel and the low bridge taking the tracks over the mainline to Queen Street, they'll probably find a way
> You are right sorry, I thought it was Barry and Penarth as well, just everything north of Cardiff Central
IIRC they are electrifying the Queen Street - Cardiff Bay line too, or converting it to electrified light rail
>With the problems they've overcome wiring through the Severn Tunnel and the low bridge taking the tracks over the mainline to Queen Street, they'll probably find a way
I don't doubt it
That said there are about 60 bridges between Crewe and Chester IIRC

But on a flight to the US, you had these fuckers giving a standing ovation for the pilots landing
This sounds like the most realistic idea I've read on this post
A federal europe where all European states keep their own laws, military taxes and socio-economic standards in their own control but have a federal oversight and federal laws that they all have to adhere too would probably be the best way to run it
A similar set up to the U.S would be most likely
It's going to be great when we have to go ahead with it anyway
Interesting
Purely anecdotal but I’ve been going to the same Villa in Portugal since I was a kid
Fairly rural type place
There are quite bright lights illuminating the main path down
When we were kids I use to push my sister near the light as it would be absolutely swarming with bugs and insects
A fun game to terrify your sister for life I’m sure you’ll agree
The last few summers and it was completely dead
Not a single flying creature on any of the lights the entire week
Such a stark contrast it was impossible not to notice
[Tŷ Hyll] (Ugly House) in North Wales is an example of a Tŷ Unnos (one night house)
Law said anyone could claim a freehold if they could build a house and get a fireplace burning in one day, with the boundaries of the property determined by how far the owner could throw an axe
It was apparently built in the 15th Century and is still going strong (as a tearoom these days)
I'd have to say [Conwy Castle] or [Caernarfon Castle] for Wales, maybe [St David's Cathedral] too
For modern buildings I quite like a lot of the newer buildings in Cardiff - [The Senedd] (our Parliament) and the [Millennium Centre]

In the UK there was a strong media response, with [scary public information films] and even entire [television shows] informing the public about AIDS
A lot of the early cases were among the gay community, so unfortunately there was quite a stigma associated with the disease there
Despite the amount of public information campaigns being broadcast in the late 1980s, it took Diana, Princess of Wales being photographed [shaking hands with an AIDS patient] to actually dispel many of the myths around how the disease was transmitted
Of course, one of the most high profile deaths from AIDS in the UK occurred in 1991 when Freddie Mercury, lead singer of Queen, passed away
The death of [Terry Higgins]  in 1982, led to the founding of [The Terrence Higgins Trust] a charity which continues to fundraise for research into AIDS, and support sufferers and their families, to this day
Thanks for the link - I wasn't aware of Fowler's push to get the campaign started, but he deserves major credit for it, yeah
[This article] suggests it was the first Government supported AIDS awareness campaign anywhere in the world at the time
Michael Portillo helping to save the Settle - Carlisle railway line from closure, when he was Transport Secretary, is my personal favourite example
> But wasn't his action literally "conservative" in conserving the service
To a degree, yeah
I don't see it as fitting with the Conservative Party's ideas of the free market though
Remember Thatcher was [alleged to have once said] “A man who, beyond the age of 26, finds himself on a bus can count himself as a failure"
>Also he came out as a train spotter after he left parliament
Yes, it's sometimes easy to forget he was a politician
He's been doing the railway journeys shows for 10 or 11 years now I think

There is a little thing in the way called the universal declaration of human rights
>No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property
That's not even mentioning the fact that most people would surely rather see the land in the hands of people offering it at a very low rent, then sold off to a certain party's rich cronies (who'll charge a fortune for rent) whenever they next end up in government

Aye, oddly enough it tastes pretty good with ice cream too
Kinda reminds me of having waffles and ice cream for some weird reason
Damn wtf
Accurate to a point, the welsh stole the sheep because the english used to prevent the welsh sheep from being fertile by fucking it and lower the price of wool by basically jizzing in the wool
So the welsh stole them back and took the punishment for shagging a sheep instead of getting caught stealing one
For ny country and for my people
But wait my celtic friend, can we both agree that the english are the real enemy, the ones who started this whole sheep shag thing
It would fuck up the womb and the human sperm would try and do its job but ofc there is a sheeps egg instead causing it to mutate and kick out an abomination leading to damage to the sheeps genitals

I believe it was my Great Great Uncle was an Engineer in North Africa in WW2
I never got the stories first hand because he died long before I was born
But essentially, he and his fellows would "wash" a tank out after it came back knocked out
Essentially they'd fill the tank with water so all the bits and pieces of former crew and tank would get out of the nooks and crannies
Then they'd open the bottom escape hatch and wash it all out the bottom
Just a little bit grim
Another one of my ancestors fought in WW1
I only saw a card he sent back to his family
He wasn't a member of my direct family, and uncle of somesuch
Don't know if he survived or not
I think he did, thankfully
My grandfather was just a child during the Blitz, but he says he remembers the sky glowing red over the horizon of the valley from the direction of Swansea, when it was essentially wiped from the map in 3 days
Wasn't rebuild until the 60s really
He still holds a grudge against the government for that; that they didn't help them out more after the war
It's not really a very important historical event but my great great great great uncle wrote the first Welsh bible

It's been a while since I was in our education system, but I'm pretty certain from hearing my younger cousin talking about his history GCSE that they still only really teach from Elizabethan/industrial revolution times through to WW2 in history classes
I think there'd be a lot more interest in it as a subject and an extracurricular activity if they taught ancient history, early medieval history, ancient world history and all the way up until the end of the Vietnam war

Dw i'n hoffi coffi
I like coffee
After struggling for years, I went with "be ti ishe fi dweud
Dwy allu dweud unrhywbeth yn Gymraeg" which roughly translates to "What do you want me to say
I can say anything in Welsh".
Normally that's enough to prove to whoever's asking that I can speak the language

And yes, I also get asked for Llanfair P.G.
It's like the equivalent of our citizenship test - you say the entirety of that, you're one of us
I’ve done this with the Welsh of this

Oh, learning it took a lot of practice, lol

It's a place name, basically a list of stuff about waterfalls and a church that are near the town
The town had its name lengthened in the 1800s to attract tourists
In fact, there's still a cafe and gift shop by the railway station today, it's an easy stop for tour coaches on the way to Holyhead
Nice, I always have to Google what it means :P
IIRC none of the places named are actually near the village
Yup, got that bookmarked for these threads too :P
No, this is just a bunch of places mashed together for tourism purposes
Keeps your town relevant in Victorian times and stuff

It's the [longest station sign] in the UK, maybe Europe, IIRC
I'm not sure whether it was renamed just for that, although they did have a 'rivalry' with a [station in mid-Wales] for the longest name
Apart from the sign and the cafe / gift shop next to it, it's a rather unremarkable place tbh
Oh lol

Lyon - was at the other end of the first high-speed rail line built in France
There's a lot of domestic travel between the two cities
Lille - city in Northern France
If you go from London to Paris, you basically travel past it on the Eurostar from London or the Autoroute from Calais
Queanbeyan, NSW - Mark Webber was from there IIRC
Leeds is apparently "the largest city in Europe without any form of light rail or underground", per [Wikipedia]
IIRC they've had plans for a tram system scrapped *twice* now, by different Governments
The city centre has undergone massive redevelopment in the last 20, 25 years or so
It's a nice place to visit, IMO
A lot of us Brits have a negative view of Birmingham because we only see the [post-industrial areas] of the city's suburbs as you drive past it on our motorway network
True - I was thinking more of mass-produced stuff with Fiat
Yr Ymerodraerh Awstria-Hwngariaidd
Ymerodraeth Awstria-Hwngari (Welsh)
Ooh boy
Pretty much all of their positions
Our extended family live both in Yorkshire and others down in the South East while we live in Wales
There was such contention about Tea vs Supper vs Dinner, my family big brained it and enforced "Swper", the Welsh word for the evening meal
No more arguments anymore
I've done Chester to Rome by train before now
As we were on holiday, we made a 'journey' out of it and had overnight stops in Paris and Milan
Except warfilms, then all germans are just clone soldiers
> The fact that it somehow took 2 weeks to travel from Dingle to Dublin in “Leap Year
Ironically that gave a reasonably neutral depiction of South Wales when the flight landed at the wrong airport
IIRC the accents of the check-in staff were reasonably correct
Green still means it takes a [phonecard] right
Haven't you got city-wide fibre to the premises now, though
> i use 3 colors: red, green and blue
but which colour are the salt & vinegar crisps
I had to read it twice to get the Tardis link tbh, and as my link shows Phonecards are a thing of the past now too
Ah, so the network is complete at least
The monopoly status is a bit weird, I do agree
I'm surprised the satellite providers are still going
I can’t ride a bike
I tried to learn when I was about 10 and then at about 15
No luck
Doesn’t help I have poor balance and trip over air
I don’t know what age but definitely under 10
We used to go on family bike rides around the lanes where I grew up, and pop into a pub for lunch or dinner and then cycle back
Haven’t ridden one in over 5 years when I rode all my families over from my old house
I had one for a few months when I was about 6-7, but never got the hang of balancing on it
It eventually kind of became my little brother's bike by silent agreement
As a welsh man i would fully back that story, although some of the basis of old welsh/celtic mythology is hard to get a hold of, its always fun to expand and think of the types of powers that would be given by the gods
Yeah i see where your coming from, makes sense
Thats why the celtic essence is good, its a videogame after all not based on fact, so potentially the irish druid can come to the aid of the welsh, or the welsh to the cornish, but thats the fiction element  of it not the fact which would be the roman invasion
We shag all sheep, not just the ones that eat leeks
I am firm in the belief that Neville Chamberlain was a disaster
I'd go even further and blame the Conservative party for the war
War was inevitable either way and the policy of appeasement was intended to but time for Britain to remilitarise
But if we had gone to war with the Rhineland then despite being much weaker, Germany would've been much more weaker
It's difficult to predict how a war in 1936 would've gone, but I'm fairly certain Britain and France would've been much more powerful relative to Germany
Literally everything
The empire, the Napolenic era, the Elizabethans, the hundred years war, the Saxons, the celts
Absolute nutters can't get enough
In Wales -
Owain Glyndŵr’s Revolt
He was the last native Welshman to hold the (self proclaimed) titled of Prince of Wales, and he lead a rebellion that spanned ~13 years
They romanticise it because they want a repeat revolt, or something
England - uh
British Empire, probably
Tudors get talked about a lot too, as well as William the Conqueror
Although that's mostly Britain as a whole
For the welsh it's kinda hard to romanticise much after the medieval period
Yes, but they love to wank off to agincourt, which tbf was pretty cool
An army of undersupplied, exhausted infantry and bowmen managed to defeat the crime of the French army including a fuck ton of cavalry
Easy to see why they love it
Not a city, but I nominated [Port Talbot] as Wales' ugliest town last time we did this, and I'll stand by that
The elevated section of the M4 motorway linking South Wales with London cuts above the town and in the distance is the steelworks
It's a major employer for the area but when it's operating that stretch of the motorway stinks of sulphur and it's always dominating the horizon
There was an explosion there a few years ago when some molten steel was spilled and exposed to water while it was being transported, nobody was seriously hurt but somebody captured this utterly apocalyptic [dashcam footage]
you mean Port Toilet
Yeah, the last few seconds really look like a nuke's gone off
Yup, the ending looks like a proper mushroom cloud after a nuke
Should have taken the One Ring there haha
No my accent is quite neutral, people are normally surprised when I tell them I'm Welsh
People say I don’t sound Welsh and then spend all their time telling me I pronounce words like tooth and saucepan wrong so I guess
Yes, no matter where in the UK I go
Even on the continent people have a hard time understanding me, and trying to explain your from Wales is even harder
Nothing super crazy and never been to the police
I’ve had plenty of people threaten me, a guy punched me in the stomach in Germany but it was shit and I just pushed him away and left
A guy grabbed me by the throat here but his friends dragged him away
A guy spat on my friend as we walked passed and he tried to fight me
I got punched in the back of the head in a nightclub because I walked into what I thought was space but turned out to be a fight
Somebody grabbed my ass in a pub once, but it was crowded enough that I couldn't tell who
Nothing else comes to mind
[Genod Droog "Dal Ni Lawr"]  - Welsh language Rap video set in a badminton court
Goldie Lookin Chain [Your Missus is a Nutter]  and many others including [Auf  Wiedersehen Mate]  a sad one about Brexit with the video really capturing the vibe of the UK before joining the EU
Also [Bonnie Tyler]  and [Shakin Stevens]
Germany ain't called the fatherland it's just some American heritage shit
When a Russia and Germany love each other they invade each others space until out pops a little Poland
Never seen one like that before, but to be fair, I don't try to open windows everywhere I go
Not in my house but they're for sale at pretty much every window place
My sister's patio doors did that
More UK Youtubers than Welsh ones, but:
* 'All The Stations'
* Geoff Marshall
* Tom Scott
* bigclivedotcom
EDIT:
* Techmoan
Gonth is the only Welsh one I know
He was basically Welsh KSI/ W2S and I think he stopped a while back
Luke Birch - UK based, focuses on education type videos, very funny
TomSka - creator of asdfmovie
Daniel Howell & Phil Lester
clickfortaz- welsh youtuber and is honestly amazing
Both the channels he's involved with are good at showing you bits of the UK you hadn't thought about
I liked his point about *All The Stations*. If the video still exists in 20, 30 years it'll be a cool snapshot of how the UK and its railways were in 2017
I've always had an interest in trains and railways so seeing far-flung rural stations isn't too dull for me :P
I’d say it’s more of a thing you do the first time you meet somebody in the UK
Or when you’re congratulating someone
Well we have Welsh which is our joint official language with English and is spoken by roughly a quarter of the population
Yes
Public transport in my village is very unreliable and quite expensive
Car is the only practical way of travelling
I can cope without one but life would be easier with a car, yeah
I can commute to work by train and the only issue with the bus services in my village is how early they stop
There's nothing after 7:15pm or so, and no service at all on Sundays
Otherwise the nearest large city is easily reachable by bus (or train), if I went there for a night out though I'd have to get a taxi home from the next town over
Buses are generally rubbish where I live - expensive, unreliable and routes can be changed or withdrawn at 2 week's notice
I live 15 minutes walk away from the city centre though and 35 minutes walk away from work so I just walk everywhere
It wouldn't be much faster by car once you've factored in traffic jams and parking
Shame about the 20% gradient to get home so I'm thinking of getting an electric bike
The only official language of the UK is Welsh
You can shoot a welshman in Chester with a bow after midnight
Pre 0ad isn’t as uncommon as you might imagine as there are loads of standing stones at least here in South Wales
Same here with pre Roman invasion
We do have some of that ogham (I think that’s it’s name) on standing stones here so there is a bit but not much
I wasn’t taught anything other than the fact that we were in the EU
The average persons knowledge of what the EU is and how it works here is undoubtedly as poor as mine, if not poorer
I know a few things from reading around because of brexit
For context, I’m a 22 year old university student, the vote was before I was old enough too, and no one I’ve met has seemingly understood the EU
I’ll leave it to everyone else to interpret whether or not that was a well and honestly informed vote
Cash, contactless bank card, or by buying a ticket through the transport company's own app (Arriva for buses, Transport for Wales for trains)
EDIT: I buy a 'carnet' of 12 single tickets through TfW's app, for my daily commute by train
This saves me a few £ a week compared to just buying paper tickets with cash
For busses I use contactless card
For trains I'll buy them online and collect at the station
Eventually the plan is for all tickets to be available with a smart card
For Transport for Wales (TfW) it's currently only weekly tickets between Wrexham and Shrewsbury, the South Wales valleys, and Swansea to Cardiff, we don't want to overload the system and watch it all fall to bits
If your smart card has a logo that looks like three little sausages, you can use to buy tickets in other parts of the UK where their smart cards have the same logo
So I could buy a ticket for a south western journey with a TfW smartcard
All slowly coming together
The way forward will eventually be mobile, smartcard, and the massive toilet paper style tickets the conductor prints out
The problem with QR codes (etickets) is that the same code will work at the barrier until flagged by staff which is why they are trying to get phased out
So if a group want to travel cheaply, one person buys a ticket and they either share a copy of the PDF or print it out a few times
Mobile tickets need to be activated and as to be displayed through the app to be valid, which gives it some extra protection against fare evasion
In my experience, QR codes don't take too long to scan compared to normal card tickets but if the screen is cracked or dirty, or not even full brightness it may not work
Smartcards can have problems downloading the ticket to the card so it's not perfect, but will eventually become the norm
What part of England is that in
This is more of an outside of Europe problem, if they have even heard of Wales at all
I understand people from far away not knowing Wales, but it's more baffling when they haven't heard of UK or Britain, but know England
Yeah that's definitely the case, especially outside of Europe
And I've got to admit, even I call her The Queen of England
But God help anyone that implies that a Welsh, Scottish or Irish (N or R) person is English
That's the one they used to use to catch spies, isn't it
Now you know why we have this flag
[this week we gained the record for the steepest street in the world, replacing a street in New Zealand as number one
At first i wasn't that sympathetic as NZ always beat us (Wales) at rugby so i felt we were due a win but given the terrible week they've had (losing the cricket world cup final in heartbreaking fashion) i find myself feeling a bit bad
Rugby, in most of the UK and Ireland, but we don't really have violence amongst fans
Our entire history
They just teach us about England and shoehorn one some comment about Wales
I make a point to try and watch foreign language shows, they are quite easy to watch in the UK as the BBC and Channel 4 tend to broadcast the best of them
The shows I have watched that have been remade in English, in the main have been less enjoyable
A great example is The Bridge , much of the charm comes from it being set somewhere so different, reproduce it in the bloody channel tunnel and it's lost everything I loved about it
So none for me
I liked how it was portrayed in the World War Z book, where the UK and Ireland returned in some way to mediaeval weaponry due to lots being stored away in museums and private collections
Additionally the amount of castles allowing survivors to hole up in spots around the country
I sometimes think "its always sunny" could have been a little bit better
I'm glad you disagree with that, but it's not what OP said
&#x200B;
They said that the claim that Brits used to sound like Americans and now do not is a spurious one
I.e. that in what is now Britain, the accent used to be what is now American
This is
nuts
Ah the italian trump
Its odd, ever since he left office the world has become a total basket case
Necrophilic beastiality is pretty nasty no doubt about  that
But savile beats cameron to the post
Fun fact, they are both tories
Make of that what you will
Thats an incredibly fair point tbh
Bet they would be BFF's if they ever met
Not quite the same but I can only listen to rap and hip hop in French specifically because I can't understand the lyrics
Disgusting lyrics put me off
Besides the occasional 'merde' I can't tell in French so it let's me enjoy the sounds
No, only heard of things like that in American serial killer movies
Not really
I went to some weekend camp thing with brownies as a kid but that's about it
I know schools round here sent year 5s to Llangrannog every year
They've been doing that at least since I was that age
Personally, I never got to go because there weren't enough people going when it was my turn
Pretty much the same as a summer camp in terms of activities like high ropes and things
I think we also sent Year 6s out to Pendine to do beach activities
There's a couple residential activity centres a bit closer that schools from around the UK come to take part in
So summer camp might not be a thing but a residential activity week with school is definitely a thing
My friend goes to a Chriatian camp somewhere in Enlgand but he's very religious
Only another 699,949,999 to go :D
Probably Rhyl
Like many of the towns on the northern coast, massively popular seaside resort before it became cheaper to fly to a small Spanish island
Now it's a bit run down and faring worse than the other towns across the coast
Dragon Studios aka Valleywood on account of it being situated in the South Wales "Valleys" area
The anti-vax movement *started* in the UK, although Andrew Wakefield ultimately lost his British medical licence
Guillaume Batard
Eastern Germany
Before I went I had the preconceptions of former Communist concrete jungles and backwards attitudes, but its actually really lovely and I much preferred it to the South
The amount of time varies depending on how well the rugby team is doing haha
I’m there right now with family and have been all over NI, we go once a year to see family
Biggest trouble has been making sure to take a certain hat off on the wrong side of town
Few suburbs of certain cities when the flags are out can put me on edge but if you’re a tourist I doubt you’d be in that area or bothered by anyone
I’ve visited Liverpool 3 times, enjoyed myself for all of them
As long as you avoid the sketchy estates on the outskirts idk what people’s problem is
I for one haven’t heard of them
Poor guy, glad it turned out well for him
I've visited all 3 countries in the benelux and all were really nice
They feel oddly similar yet distinct at the same time
From my experience Luxembourg and Belgium felt more similar to eachother than to the Netherlands (but I only visited Eupen and Liege in Belgium so that is probably why)
The Netherlands feels really relaxed and laid back generally especially compared to the UK and Germany where I've lived
The pace of life there is just a bit less busy and manic I think
Luxembourg was very cosmopolitan and very multicultural (or at least Luxembourg City was)
It had a very nice mix between old and new and actually the way the older bit of the city looked reminded me a lot of Edinburgh
Its definitely an underrated city
As for Belgium, as I said I only visited Liege and Eupen so my insight isn't as well rounded as it is for the Netherlands, where I've visited multiple cities
Liege felt very French, or at least how I imagine France feels (I've never been there)
Along the river there was a very weird combination of buildings where every other building was a beautiful old 1700s looking building, but was surrounded on both sides by an ugly benidorm style block of flats
As for Eupen it was gorgeous and definitely felt more German (not just because thats what people were speaking)
The trains were a bit ugly and not as nice as in Germany/ Luxembourg/ Netherlands but there was a lot of building work going on while I was there so it felt like somewhere in progression
Yeah I enjoyed Liege but its probably one of those "once is enough" cities
I was warned beforehand to not bother with Liege so had low expectations
It was definitely better than people let on, but I can see why it has a not fantastic reputation
I'm hoping I'll get to visit Flanders sometime relatively soon (once covid is gone) so I'll be in a better position to make a definitive judgement about Belgium as a whole
I've wanted to go to Bruges ever since I saw the film set there
I've also heard good things about Ghent and Antwerp and I'd love to go to Baarle-Hertog
Definitely far from the worst city I've ever visited
*Macbeth* and *Of Mice and Men* were our GCSE texts
We read stuff like *Lord of The Flies*, *Animal Farm*, *Romeo and Juliet* and *An Inspector Calls* in Years 7 - 9
I lived in Germany for a year:
Achso, Tja, naja
Basically everyone quoting downfall
Ich ben main sei
[Dakota - Stereophonics]
Or literally any Tom Jones song
>we are mexicans
Whaaaaat
You telling me that there are people who are dumb enough to mix up Spaniards and Mexicans
That's pretty damn bonkers tbf
So don't mention the "British" Isles
Or two perticular drinks at the pub lol
Americans
Well that explains that then
American ignorance is kinds legendary tbh
Oh I'm sure Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK
More than enough , there's just a few here in Wales
Lots, mostly across England and Wales
I think I lost count before I even turned ten
Wales: too many to count but definitely Caerphilly, Chepstow, Raglan, Newport, Cardiff, Castell Coch, Coity, St Fagans, Abergavenny, Caldicot, Usk, Aberystwyth, Caerleon, Oxwich, Ogmore
England: Warwick, Nottingham, Tower of London, Alnwick, Bamburgh, Lindisfarne, Lincoln, Lancaster, Windsor, Norwich and probably loads more I don't remember
Scotland: Edinburgh
Germany: Neuschwanstein, Nordkirchen, Sparrenberg, Vischering
Probably a few more that I've forgotten too
Hungary: Budapest Citadella
Lost count, there’s about 6 small ones within 15 minutes of me
Some highlights of some slightly further away castles are:
[Cardiff Castle]
[Caerphilly Castle]
[Castell Coch]
There are 7 vowels in Welsh (a, e, i, o, u, w, y)
I have no idea if there is any words with all 7 (google isn't being helpful), but I think it would look weird
Nah with English anyway some of the accents and dialects from certain parts of the UK are harder than US/Canada/Aus/NZ accents
Not that hard, definitely not anywhere near the hardest in the UK
Scouse, Brum, Geordie and Glaswegian are all harder
I generally find Yorkshire to be alright (but then again I go to uni there), Lancashire can be okay in places but Scouse and Geordie are indecipherable
Generally not too bad but I've heard a few more difficult to understand ones
Sometimes you lot talk very quickly haha
[St Fagans] regularly wins awards for being a great museum
They’ve taken buildings from all ages and parts of Wales and moved them brick by brick to this outdoor museum
It’s just outside Cardiff and I’d recommend anyone to go
It’s great for kids and for adults
When we were young we went to the Victorian schoolhouse and acted out a Victorian school day
The visitors loved that aha
> The Imperial War Museum
IWM North in Manchester is pretty good too, as is the Museum of Science and Industry
Yeah, that's on my to-do list next time I get down to London
Would like to see an SR-71 up close
And here I was thinking I could do Tube + Bus
Bugger
Thanks for the tip
Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Northern Ireland
I suppose Ireland would be our neighbour
We in Wales don't share a border with the paddies but they are pretty close to us
A I'd need to do is take the Anglesea ferry and I'm in Dublin
London is a different beast to everywhere else
Cardiff is mostly a shithole
Having a few beers with my mates on the banks of the Rhine watching the sunset behind the Kölner Dom
Visiting Arnhem and Nijmegen
Really wanted to see the bridges from Operation Market Garden and the towns were also really nice
The pure novelty and beauty of Eupen
Had a lovely chat with some French dudes on the train from Germany
They even gave me one of their beers
I’m am from the British isles but I wouldn’t call myself British
It’s not a lack of understanding, we just don’t feel British is our culture (some of us)
The same way someone might feel Basque and not Spanish
Even though they are technically from Spain
Edit: Also, the Good Friday Agreement ruled legally that someone in NI has the choice to be British or Irish (or both) citizens
So it’s even more reasonable for someone in NI to consider themselves solely Irish and not from
Britain
You might have been but the original comment is whether being Welsh is the same as being British which isn’t true, so I took it to mean you were in agreement
Yeah, culture and technical geography are two different things is what it comes down to
You are what you identify with, doesn’t matter what arbitrary name someone else has given to wherever you live lol
Yes, the late great [Howard Marks] aka Mr Nice
Born in the South Wales valleys in the 1940s, he got into Oxford University, discovered cannabis there
Fast forward 20 years and he was moving tons of hash all over the world from Pakistan
He eventually got caught and jailed in Terre Haute penitentiary in America
I think he got sentenced to 25ish years but served 6
He returned to the UK in '96 and made a new career writing books about his life and doing one man shows etc
He died in 2016, a legend
They made a film about him called Mr Nice in 2010
[Interview with Mr Nice ]
Which way round do you question that figure
For me it seems more common than that, but then I’m in that 16-24 age group, so could be to do with that
Yeah I mean think of your parents/older family, I don’t think I know any of them who I would think even might’ve
I think I know of two or three over-40s who have
Compared to 20-30+ people my age lol
I think that’s not the guaranteed route really
Most people I know have just had it a few nights out
I don’t really know anyone who I would consider to have a problem with it but who knows
The issue is that drug users are criminalised
What are you supposed to do if you’re addicted
Drug users shouldn’t be arrested, they should be afforded therapy/rehab etc
It’s worked for Portugal
The war on drugs has been a failure here, should stop sending people to prison and start helping them solve their problems
I was under the impression that class A drugs were up in general but that drugs like heroin and opiates were down
I’ve only met one person who’s had heroin
Yeah I mean I would go as far to advocate that the state provide drugs to addicts so they don’t commit crimes to acquire them
Perhaps as a requirement they must attend therapy or rehab of sorts, after a certain number of purchases or something
There’s definitely some sort of balance to be had, but I would suggest most drug addicts don’t actually want to be addicted to drugs, even if they refuse help
They can get sold on but that’s not as bad as the current scenario
They can be investigated and caught if they’re lying
Drug dealers are certainly a problem, and I do think that should always be a crime of some degree, by obviously if there’s a legal way to acquire drugs then drug dealers would lose a significant part of their income
I think it would have to be gradual if they were to be fully legalised for consumption
There would have to be some way to limit or track people’s purchases as best as possible, requiring your name, address etc each time so it’s recorded
Only able to buy it in the daytime
Things could go the other way and people aren’t bothered with drugs since there’s no “underground drug culture” etc
Of course people will still take drugs “badly” and cause trouble, but if the education is there with how unhealthy and addictive they are, alongside the fact that you have to jump through a couple of hoops to acquire it would be enough to keep class A use to at least current figures
I doubt any significant changes in cannabis use would really matter, I personally don’t see it as anything negative
It’s on par with drinking if not generally safer
For me it’s a matter of time for that to be legalised
Class As, I’m not convinced they should be but I don’t think it would be some nightmare with everyone high all the time
If Wales was independent, Monmouthshire would be the most likely part of Wales to leave and join England
There used to be a political party that advocated Monmouthshire becoming part of England
We learnt that North Wales speaks a different dialect of Welsh to South Wales but we never learnt any of it
In terms of in English it was never even mentioned
From my friends who went to schools in England they weren’t even taught that Welsh was still a language or spoken
I'm a simple bloke,  so a chedder cheese and marmite sandwich with brown wholemeal bread is my favorate kinda sarnie tbh
It ain't fancy, but it is bloody tasty all the same
Ah now ya talking my language
Ya can't beat a good old crisp butty
Chuck some cheese spread in there and ya onto a winner
Then again you could alway mix it up and swap those walkers for a pack of those posh crisps like tyrells or kettle chips
They are a bit firmer than ya walkers but they add a decent crunch to the sarnie
Germany
I love northern Germany and find the south a bit stuffy and conservative (even though the scenery is gorgeous)
Never been to Austria or Switzerland but their accents are fucking indecipherable
Das ist genau was ich meine
Yeah Baden Württemberg isn't as bad as Bayern but I just find that I feel a lot more at home in NRW or Niedersachsen for example
Bitte schön :)
Not too bad, a day return from Bridgend to Cardiff is £6
10 which is 20 mins non stop, and there's plenty of options if you travel regular
Short distance is fine, usually quicker and cheaper than a bus or taxi
Long distance is when the algorithms get a bit funky
Best site to compare European train travel is seat61
com
Most stuff is concentrated in the far South, but a few things like the National Library are located roughly in the centre
There's actually more than I thought outside London, looking at your list
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch is in Derby, and IIRC at least part of the Office for National Statistics is in Newport, South Wales
There's definitely something passporty in durham
Might be regional though
Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales* and Shakespeare's *Macbeth* - both because of the older forms of English they were written in
I'm not finished with my country's program yet but it is particularly annoying that most of the books we study are from America
Britain and Ireland have such a wealth of literature, yet that is ignored in favour of American literature for some reason
They do not seem relevant to Britain or Europe
It wouldn't be as bad if the books were actually good but so far they seem to be mediocre and sub par, which just makes the choice to prioritise American books even more bizarre
Honestly, it was just reading it over and over again that did my head in
Yes, R&J was our Year 9 book, we did Macbeth for GCSE
Those who have traveled to other European countries, what stereotypes did you have that turned out to be totally wrong
Went to Italy
Drivers were not insane maniacs
Very disappointed, want refund
Edit: for everyone wondering where I went it was the Veneto region around lake Garda
I haven't really been to any countries where I had stereotypes/ preconceptions (only been to UK, Germany and Benelux though)
Most of my stereotypes are for the Mediterranean/ ex Soviet bloc Countries that I've never been to
Anyone who's kept in a basement for their whole lives :p
> In rome they are all maniacs
I swear to god i feared for my life every time i went into a taxi
Genoa was the only place where I thought the "Italians are all maniacs" stereotype had some truth to it
Even then it was nothing more than they were quick away from traffic lights
Wait for the green man and *don't* follow the locals because they know the timings of things
Not a problem really
Wasn't a lot of this viewpoint based on the Swiss national Military service model, where citizens are issued with an assault rifle which they effectively keep at home (with ammo) in case of invasion
Ah, looks like some of my info was wrong or out of date
Apologies, and thanks for the correction
First language is Welsh, but since leaving school I've primarily been speaking English
Now my Welsh is a lot poorer than it was and I've forgotten a boatload of words and their meanings
However there are still some words where I know the Welsh but not the English for it, some where I know the meaning but not the word and some where I know the word but not the meaning
I'm exactly the same
Although I feel strangely patriotic when I can only remember the Welsh word for something
Exactly the same for me, I've posted about it before too
Björk talking about her TV, specifically
Good point, brain fail, sorry
Haha
In Welsh we always just call our boy/girlfriends "my love". I like it, no ambiguity
There's no good word for annoying in Welsh, which is really annoying
> No, Poland, the ladder doesn’t *need* to be female
This [step ladder joke] won't work in Polish then
no thanks
I like winning the rugby
We did when I was growing up, but thats mostly because I have a large family and there isn't enough room for everyone on one table
Not at all and its quite common
I do it every day
Love this one
That is interesting, and unusual that some are in smaller cities like Kassel and Karlsruhe
In Welsh it follows the same pattern as many (especially Teutonic) European languages, except with some small alterations for masculine or feminine:
1 = un
2 = dau / dwy
3 = tri (m) / tair (f)
4 = pedwar (m) / (pedair (f)
20 = ugain
21 = un ar hugain
22 = dau / dwy ar hugain
23 = tri / tair ar hugain
24 = pedwar / pedair ar hugain
>21 = un ar hugain
Is that Gogese
I was always taught Dau deg un, though admittedly I'm not a Welsh speaker merely a learner
If I visited Portugal and didn't speak any Portuguese, would it be better for me to speak in English or Spanish

D'oh, of all the people I've since been told about, she seems like the biggest omission
Cheers, another one for my new list of people to check out
Yes, although her mother was English and her father Nigerian, Shirley was born in an area of Cardiff called "Tiger Bay", near the city's port and docklands
It's now been redeveloped and gentrified as "Cardiff Bay", and you'll find a lot of restaurants, our Parliament, and a theatre there
They're on my new list of bands to check out, anyway
Obligatory reminder that *Your Mother's got a penis* :P
Nope, mistake on my part leaving him out
That sounds right up my street, I've heard of them but that's about it
Thanks for the recommendation
Yeah, looks like I've got some new music to check out, anyway
It seems like Duffy had a good album and then just vanished from the music scene, I wonder what happened to her
No, but Jones is a fairly common Welsh surname
Great song
Early Manics albums seem a bit raw now, but *Everything Must Go* is one of my favourite 90s albums
Cheers, I'll check them out
Yeah I've heard of Catfish
Got a few new bands to check out after this comment, then
Good call
Now that's a cool fact
Not one I knew so thanks for that
Another good choice, but *Generation Terrorists* just beats it for me
Super Ted
Need to learn how to cross the road safely
Then Super Ted and Spotty will help
I remember watching it soo much in school
I'd also add SuperTed and Ivor the Engine for Wales
Yes, first broadcast on S4C in Welsh, under the title *Sam Tân*
Is that  52% done by mass or population

We're
okay
Flashes of brilliance in a young team, but we lost to the Belgians, and beat Mexico in a friendly
Czech Republic worry me
I feel we're losing the "Together Stronger" we had since 2016
Giggs is currently absent due to an assault charge, 3 players have been sent home due to COVID breaches
So who knows
Tricky group really
I'd take second round
Yeah, IIRC we've lost some players from the 2016 squad too
Retirement, that sort of thing
Every language sounds beautiful until you learn to speak it
When I first read your comment I thought it was strange, I thought, doesn’t everyone know Irish exists
But then I remembered I’m a linguist so who knows how much thought the average population gives to old languages
Apparently there are still some islands off the coast where Welsh is a dominant language, at least moreso than English (or so I’ve heard)
Tito was alright wasn't he
Are you not aware how much Thatcher is hated over here
The vast majority of people who piss on her grave are from NEngland
As for Cromwell, dear God do you honestly think the man who stuck us under a Military dictatorship is popular with anyone except a few nutcases
Yeah Cromwell ain't popular in Britain
Man stuck us under a military dictatorship, banned everything, killed a king and burned down a bunch if villages over on your side of the sea
Literally only supported by Radical Republicans who want to knock off liz
Literally never heard of this guy
I guess he should have realised the country would fall apart without him, and should have tried to transition to more autonomous democracies when he knew he was not long for this world
You do realise he tried to install an absolutist Catholic monarchy
That is pretty far right
No we reached the nadir of the welsh language a few centuries ago
It'll never reestablish itself as the primary language, but that experience means it will never be allowed to die out
Didn't happen to us, and we've been doing this a long time
First language in a lot of areas
but the populous parts of Wales are a weird mix of 100% Welsh place names, first language English speakers who speak English with Welsh grammar/syntax and random Welsh words, and everything in-between
Welsh was killed by English imperialism but is having a revival via education in schools, the emergence of television and radio stations in Welsh etc, now more young people speak it than their grandparents who were beaten for speaking it and forgot it
For historical reasons, Northern Wales has a stronger Welsh speaking community
They also speak a slightly different dialect than in the south
The 2011 Census showed there was more of an [East / West split] in the distribution of Welsh speakers
The question is quite vague as it asks people if they can speak, read or write Welsh and assumes those abilities are all rather separate, IIRC
I’m not sure it’s quite the same but I hadn’t really heard about [Basque Whalers] until recently
They were so successful in the old and the new world
There was a Basque-Icelandic pidgin language, and a Basque-Algonquin pidgin language, due to the sheer number or Basque whalers operating and living in now modern Canada and Iceland
Such a unique interaction between people that you just don’t hear about (unless I’m just ignorant)
A ship of Basque sailors, travelling to the new world, meeting Native American tribes, establishing trading posts, creating a language
To me that’s as interesting as any ninja or viking story
These pidgin languages include parts of Spanish, French, German, English, Dutch and more
In my head the Basque people never had opportunity to have such international influence, yet they had established trading routes and posts in Ireland, Iceland and the colonial new world, all from northern Iberia
It really just caught me off guard
Now, or hopefully in like 20 years where I can stop hearing about Brexit and hopefully Wales is an independent or at least equal nation in the U.K. Anytime in the past was undoubtedly worse for Wales, strikes and the shutting down of industry in the 70s and 80s. Aberfan and Tryweryn before that
WWII and WWI, strikes in the 1920s. Before that dangerous industry and disease
Seems silly to go back to any of these times
Go back even further and you'd be speaking celtic
Proto-Celtic
I applied a very scientific method of saying them in an Italian, then Finnish accent and seeing which one sounded better
I have too many Finlands in there, but can't work out what to change

The only branch in Wales is in Cardiff
Warrington and Manchester are the closest branches if you're in North Wales
I went to the Currywurst museum in Berlin
Rollmops are good stuff though
So many, my reddit namesake [Yma O Hyd (Still Here)] and [Calon Lân (Pure Heart)] (which is translated as clean heart there but I think pure is better) are two brilliant songs, that only sound better when sung by crowds of people
I do like the anthem though, and don’t see a reason for it to change
Yma O Hyd was my shout too, great song for sure
Don't forget 'Bread of Heaven'
Brilliant song, sang it at my Grandads funeral and was amazing
I don’t know how well it represents Wales though, I feel like we aren’t as religious as in the past, so I left it out because it didn’t feel so emblematic of Wales
Not very well known
Welsh Rabbit (or Rarebit ) is one of our national delicacies
Unfortunately it's not rabbit but rather cheese on toast .
Around 1 in 3 people speak Welsh in Wales, and there are many thousands spread elsewhere in the U.K. People don’t realise how many people speak it since if you only speak English you don’t realise who in the town your in can speak Welsh since they won’t use it with you
I believe there’s not a single area of Wales with less than 10% Welsh speakers
Every child learns some at school but only those who attend Welsh language schools come away with any significant fluency
The goal of the Welsh govt is to have 1 million 1st language speakers by 2050
First language is around 600,000 but total speakers (including second language) worldwide is somewhere between 800,000 and 1 million
There are pockets of Welsh speakers which are getting bigger and bigger as the government pushes for more recognition of the Welsh language
It used to be that the Welsh language schools were worse than the English ones, but in recent times that has changed and now its desirable to send your children to Welsh language schools
I believe it’s just Argentina, [Y Wladfa] is the name for the areas where it’s still spoken
There’s a lot of Welsh heritage in America too
Many US presidents had Welsh heritage and Lincoln even had [100,000] election pamphlets printed in Welsh
In the cities (mostly Cardiff)
Indian - outstanding
Chinese/ Italian/ Vietnamese/ Thai - okay
Most others - meh if you can even find it
At a glance, I wouldn't call it realistic
They leave their guard open way too much, the number one unrealistic error I see in films
In other words, their swords are not being held in a way that actually defends them
But I've definitely seen worse, and there are aspects of this fight that are done really well
One nice touch is that the victor appears to be a much better swordsman than the defeated

My thoughts over the last 2 months:
"Giggs has got to go"
"There's no way we're qualifying"
"Holy **** we might actually do it"
"WE MADE IT
GIGGS IS THE BEST MANAGER EVER"
"...at least we qualified
"We're going to get battered in the group stage"
"Wait we might actually make it out of this group"
Additionally our FA on Twitter posted "Baku
Baku
Rome
In that order
Tough
Think we'll lose to Italy but we have a chance against Turkey and Switzerland
Not keen on playing in Baku though
I'm pretty chuffed with the draw considering we got Turkey and Switzerland instead of Germany and Portugal
Very true but with the confusing rules this year we could have only been in the group we got or in Denmark and Russia's group
Playing Turkey in Baku will be tough but at least we have two games in Baku in a row rather than having to travel from Baku to Rome and back to Baku again
Still Switzerland, Turkey, Italy in that order, could have been much worse ;)
In Welsh we went true Galaxy Brain and call it
# a
Yes
I feel like Wales has done nothing but suffer as part of this shit show
Yes
Wales doesn't get a good deal out of the UK, it has kept us poor for centuries
People here are starting to realise this and there is growing support for independence (especially since the Brexit vote)
At this point I think its 50/50 whether it'll happen in my lifetime
I don't know what the fuck is going on
Ok know Wales voted leave but we have a non-insignificant percentage of our population is English retirees
Wales couldn't survive on its own though and parliament shits on us already
I just hope Scotland gets out
I’ve seen a few English people say they want to ditch the other nations due to the (pretty wrong) reports recently that Scotland produces more than 50% of the UK’s deficit
It’s of the idea that the other nations are a drain on England’s economy
If this was true then there would never have been English complaints about the other nations nationalists
I think the brexit process has shown to a lot of Welsh people that Westminster don’t give a shit about us and also the only reason for leaving isn’t brexit, it’s just pushed more people onto the Indy side
The reason Wales voted to leave is because we have almost no independent media - for example when England had the junior doctor crisis everyone in Wales thought it was happening here too, not true different system
Also, there’s a considerable number of English retirees who come from a typical brexit sort of background, which doesn’t mean to say they shouldn’t have an opinion
I saw a YouGov poll this morning about opinions on the prorogue and the region Wales’ stats were considered in was Midlands and Wales
Wales is continuously pegged as a region of England in stats and figures and if not independence more devolution and consideration needs to be applied
The major reason Wales is screwed is because of the Union, not because it’s naturally in a bad state
Westminster has given us the most basic since the 1970s and 80s when heavy industry went into decline
It would weaken every nation initially no doubt
But the figures saying Scotland produces >50% of the UK’s deficit means nothing as they have no borrowing powers to begin with, same with Wales (which incidentally also says Wales produces >50% which again doesn’t make sense)
Wales produces more than twice the electricity it produces and way more water than it uses
There’s plenty of opportunity for it to stand and there’s many countries that started in the same position and are better off today
As a welshman, the welsh economy is broken, we only don’t want independence because we know that we have had no investment for so long that we couldn’t even survive on our own
like we can barely survive in the union, forget alone
Over pushed the idea that we are dependant nations to the point where they accidentally proved that they might be lying/manipulating figures to make it seem that way
I think there needs to be serious study into independence and the results so that the potential results are all mapped out before we can say exactly which situation is best really, rather than there being no definitive numbers and facts to speak about
I think one of the independence movements selling points is that it will be a leaving process of many years where powers and rules are changed one by one not all of a sudden at the end of a set time period
I'm the opposite, until I met more people in Uni, everyone I knew drank tea with only a couple also drinking coffee
In Slovenia or Wales
I've never heard that in Wales, but then, not many people in a Welsh kebab shop are sober enough to respond to questions anyway
Cardiff - the coal trade
Cardiff grew to be the largest settlement in Wales due to the coal trade, and I believe at one point was one of the biggest coal exporting ports in the world
Coal dominated South Wales throughout the late 19th and 20th Centuries and we still haven't recovered from the industry's collapse in the 1980s
We were able to defeat a small number of Napoleon’s force stationed here
The men thought that the women dressed in traditional garments were British forces and just surrendered to them
A few proposals have been made, but the issue then is people say it either [gives Wales too much prominence] within the Union Jack, or [changes it too much]
Personally, I say skip the Dragon and incorporate the [Flag of St David] instead
[I hope you're wearing sunglasses] No, really
It was aired first time in the UK last year funnily enough
> Solution: officially announce that you have changed the flag to be the first one, except for leaving the dragons background red instead of changing it white
LOL
>Is it just me or does the last one look more like a combination of the flags of Germany and France than anything else
It's an explosion in a paint factory

American liberalism is left-wing relative to them because they don't have an actually left-wing party

However, I think the Democrats are liberals, in line with parties like LREM and the Lib Dems, and hence the title is technically accurate in the sense of the party, but not accurate in the case of describing the political spectrum

For Wales, The rise for being independant is on the increase
We do not want to be with england nor the UK
Basically the UK hates its own country's
And you base this on what exactly
The inconsistent opinion polls or the angry pant-shitting rants on reddit
I think we're a bit more qualified to speak of the state of our union than some of the Europhiles on reddit who'd tell you otherwise
Parliament unilaterally agrees on one thing
A no deal exit is off the table and must not happen at any cost
The EU members know this
This is all a game right now
The EU has no incentive to give the UK a better deal now because they know the UK would rather have a second referendum that a hard exit
We may get delays/extensions, attempted work arounds, leadership revolt and even a general election to get there but the chances of a second referendum are growing
I think you underestimate younger voters tbh
Nobody I know voted as we assumed we would remain, were to distracted with our own bs and/or simply didn't know what was going on (Most of us watch little tv and spend more time on social media were political advertisements aren't presented to us)

Most the EU isnt European atall, the average citizen in Europe knows nothing about what goes on in Brussels, they are more nationalistic than ever on top of that
And lets face it, half the countries are still fairly poor by western standards, and the other half are in some form of crisis or meltdown, of the wealthier nations you have the likes of Greece, Italy and Spain who havent really seen any growth or positivity in YEARS and face massive unemploment all over the place with lots more negatives to come, so why the fuck would those 3 be playing games

Interestingly, the Soviets actually had absurdly detailed military maps of most potential adversaries - you can find their maps of New York and the like and they’re accurate not just to the road but to the building - they were better than many country’s own maps
So they definitely had the data to fill this in, presumably they excluded it in their domestic maps for political reasons
I love democracy
Yep
Though that was more commonly by changing the angles and distances involved - distortion rather than complete expunging
Idea was that a civilian (or indeed anyone) could still use a map to map out a route to a location but, for example, an artillery commander in an invading force wouldn’t be able to use them to work out the exact distance and bearing from the village he was in to the next one over
Or a sniper or mortarman wouldn’t be able to work out the exact distance from their position to the strongpoint 3 streets over
Agreed - I can't imagine how someone would believe they'd crossed into the West while still being in the East
Probably a grain of truth to it in that East German (and indeed Eastern block in general) maps often were distorted
Not to prevent civilian travel (they'd still enable you to map out a route) but selected distances and dimensions and angles would be distorted so as to render the maps useless for more military applications (artillery rangefinding, aerial bombing, sniping, etc)
Absolutely
I mean, the Berlin metros remained connected between West and East at a couple of key points, at least for a while
My grandfather was an intelligence officer in the West for a bit and used to have to occasionally retrieve enlisted who'd accidentally stayed on the metro too long (the East German police would pick them up and make a big song and dance about them being attempted spy incursions)

Scotland nooo take Wales with you
At the moment there’s more than enough conservative support here to keep plaid well out judging by the election results
And everyone else for that matter
The problem is that the rural communities, and farmers like conservative values and see liberalism as a threat to their way of life
Equally a lot of people out in the real rural areas have “comfortable money” and believe the message that conservatives will help them maintain that lifestyle
At the same time, poorer areas like Newport and Ebbw Vale in the south feel neglected and overlooked
It didn’t help that a large amount of refugees were settled in Newport which is already a deprived area
And so people viewed what little they had as being taken away and given to the refugees whilst the conservative government held up their hands and said “hey it’s not our fault, the EU made us do it”.
There is widespread resentment here that the social welfare of some of the poorest areas in the UK is being given to foreigners and taken away from deprived communities to do it
And that the foreigners threaten conservative rural lifestyles
You can call it racism
And in many cases it is
But if you look deeper it’s fear and anger that they’ve been neglected for so long
This really was a people’s vote on the issue of brexit
The problem was that they believed all the misinformation and finger pointing bullshit that went along with it
South Wales also has little to know interest in welsh language with the vast majority not identifying with Plaids Welsh national identity
It sucks, it really does, and it’ll be frustrating to see how far people will let themselves be pushed before they realise they’ve been fooled, again
What’s even more frustrating is that those people who are voting conservative here are doing so and truly believe they’ve made the right choice and they’ve helped protect the NHS
And I truly believe rather than admitting they were wrong when it comes to it, people will stick to their decision to the end because they can’t bare the thought of admitting they got tricked or believed the media
Damn, hate to see Wales still stuck on here

I hope it works out but I suspect you might just be a few weeks behind

What airline is the larger model plane behind the Minister's desk
EDIT: Congrats on the new tunnel, too
Road, or Rail
Thanks - I recognised the Norwegian plane but the SAS one was the one I was curious about
The angle didn't really help me identify it
Thanks for the info, that's quite an impressive project
Ah, thanks
The front view wasn't too clear
That's even more impressive
Thanks
As person of the year 2006 this greatly offends me

i’m from south wales which doesn’t really fit into the bap/bun/barm/etc debate but i moved into a flat in a northern uni and honestly half the time i thought people were chatting shit but turns out they really actually do use cob
these northerners aye
Who the frick puts mayo on chips
don’t worry all of wales is bap too
There were already two or three ferry companies operating ferries directly from Ireland to France, and to multiple ports in the two countries too
There is nothing new here, just a new ferry company
This feels like sitting on the naughty step watching the other kids have fun :(
Sadly nobody who actually supports Brexit in Britain actually cares about any of the facts, or think that they won’t be affected by the inevitable downsides of Brexit
I’ve noticed a huge increase in this kind of stuff on European news
Out of interest, is European media really going at the UK at the moment over brexit
I’d thought you’d all got bored of talking about it like we had
The sad truth is that most of the middle class hate this and don’t want to leave at all
Most of the poorer working class or those on welfare simply don’t understand or at worst don’t care
And really only the wealthy upper class and stubborn opinionated oldies are full on pro-brexit
Is Europe really losing that much with us
It’s Britain’s loss and Europe’s gain
The UK is Europe's USA

Odd pattern there, they trust their former victims the French yet do not trust the nations that beat em in ww2
There is weird coincidence in that
Perish
Great Britain isn’t that insulting, if you put “England” instead that would’ve been very insulting to welsh people
But also funny
You’ve pissed off Welsh nationalists but made Welsh unionists piss their pants in excitement
I immediately had this same thought
Great stuff, we'll pick the other 26 up in the morning
Those pine trees are yew trees they are poisonous and stop animals coming through most old churches in England have them round the boarders

Reminds me slightly of how Amsterdam looked when I first went there
Seems like a similar style to the buildings, it looks so beautiful
Can't believe no one has mentioned his flat back tyre yet
Status, maybe
As a remain voter it drains me to think I’ll have to deal with this shit for the rest of my life
I’m welsh but im gutted for myself
Stupid Brexit
What did the Welsh ever do to you
Exactly, the EU as a "unit" is great for countries like Belgium, Lithuania, Estonia who can unite to be a force similar to the UK/France etc, oversimplifying it to be "UK, FRANCE, GERMANY" irrelevant
which is obviously not true
Why is this
I have no strong feelings one way or the other
GM is not banned in the EU, specific strains are banned
Primarily because the EU could not demonstrate the proposed benefits
The moment a GM crop that has reproducible and measurable benefits exists it will be allowed

So I can post it on r/AgedLikeMilk if you’re wrong (despite really hoping you won’t be)
I saw the ad campaign for that questionnaire they sent round earlier this year
Disgusting
Tried looking for the UK and then it hit me :(
I miss being on these cool stat maps
Wales is tabling potential independence for the first time in its history at the senedd so hopefully in my life time we can be part of the state again
It's too early to say, I expect this first mention in the senedd to be shot down but I feel that as the ramifications of Brexit continue it'll only grow in support
Especially if NI or Scotland leave first
*Dam* that's impressive
I'm assuming the UK inherits Spain's 3100km of high-speed rail
In which case I'm reasonably OK with that :P
I guess so
Good point - I guess I wanted the trains more :P
Does anyone know who/how these borders are drawn
I'm from one of the red areas in Wales, and it appears as though the border has been drawn to separate off the wealthy M4 corridor (the blue sliver to the south) and the poorer valleys into two separate regions, even though for lots of other purposes 'South Wales' is taken as a whole
I'm just wondering if Wales might have been divided in this way deliberately to create a 'less developed region' to secure additional funding or something
Fancy Wales and Cornwall voting for Brexit, both net beneficiaries
What does it take to be a more developed because Wales is actually developed I'd say
I'm Welsh and this hurts
Wel ffyc
This was clearly made by an English man
around 21% of uks export income comes from South Wales
same, sheffield in the uk is fairly nice compared to my home town but my home town is in blue and sheffield is in yellow
The EU benefits that Wales has seen in places like Merthyr is crazy
The fact that a majority of Wales voted for Brexit is utterly absurd
West Wales isn't all bad
All those new roads
“What has the EU ever done for us

Happy to see my hometown of Carmarthen on there, was technically called Maradunium at the time though

Genuinely funny joke, I don't think you'll get much applause for it today though
It isn't inefficient though
It provides a service for 400m+ and manages to do it much cheaper per head than any of the individual nations within could do so
Ya know this is possibly the most sensible thing I've read on this post tbh
Yeah it's been fun winding up these nationalists but ya right, nationalism kills
That's a bit rich coming from a turk, you guys are the last people who should be talking about exterminating a people
About as petty as yours tbh
Let's be fair, it's not as if your argument required a full and consistent take down bud
And
Do you really expect anyone to take claims you make seriously when you still deny the Armenian genocide
Come on pal, surely you would know that this is not a hill you are going to win and battles on
Well the point here is that if ya gonna make claims about atrocities, ya gotta keep your own house in order first
Its not as if Turkey has ever claimed responsibility for the Armenian genocide, so why should anyone take your claims seriously
That's my point
So quid pro quo
Admit you did wrong to the Armenians and then we might talk about your grievances
Not really
More like outright hypocrisy on your part
You can't engage in claims of victimhood if you yourself have been known to get up to some horrific shit
So own up or shut up
Those are your only two options here

Picky, but it perhaps sends the wrong message to have the countries which legalised it latest be the most green (green being the ‘positive’ colour)
Is there any countrys that dony say it's legal but dont say its ilegal
Not great
It was seen as a counter cultural movement and thus anti-soviet and repressed
There are at least a few missing, there’s a major roman road near where I live that isn’t on this map
Shocked and quite surprised to read people's anecdotes in this thread
Perhaps ignorantly, I've always rebuffed the traditionally ignorant UK narrative on all things Romania: I've lived with great Romanian flatmates and generally only experienced good things from the country and its people, without ever having been lucky enough to visit
In my mind, Romania didn't suffer problems on this scale any more

North Wales too has more than one line as well, there is a line that runs down the Conwy Valley towards Betws-Y-Coed
UK here, lived in Newport, Sheffield and Manchester
This isn’t because we all have houses, we all live in tiny houses compared to everyone else or rows or terraced houses
The government here tended to house the poor in freshly built “council estates” and “council towers”, at least that’s the case in Wales, and so apartments are associated generally with being poor (not so much in london but london is so different from the rest of the country it’s not worth entertaining)
Due to the bad association and the general shoddiness of anything built within the last 60 years here, we tend to go for older, preferably victorian or earlier, terraced, semi detached or detached housing, and tend to avoid more dense forms of housing
Of course we pay for this in tiny houses and gentrification
ideally, your free space would be the city
Our cities just aren’t nice enough to trust your kids in them sadly

What about a place called "Mold" in North Wales
Surprised Splott didn’t make it onto there
I remember in school a teacher telling us Mumbles was named because the two hills looked like breasts and in an old British language the word for mammals sounds like Mumbles
Hey mumbles isn't odd
r/llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
What's odd about Maidenhead
On top of the few pointings out, there are actually only 10 letters there because ‘Ll’ counts as an individual letter in the Welsh alphabet
There is more vowels in the Welsh language than the English language
Indeed, Welsh is a beautiful language that rolls off the tongue really nicely of you know how to pronounce things, otherwise you’re going to have a bad time
Where's the aisle of random crap in the middle of the store
They always seem to be moving the stock round at random times in my local Aldi
Usually when the place is most full
Do you guys have Lidl too
It's like two similar but not quite the same stores
And yes, Lidl have a similar random product aisle in the middle of the store
Yeah, Aldi are smartening their UK stores up too
Fancy new refrigerators for the meat, things like that
They have really taken over the middle of the supermarket 'market' here, the likes of Asda are struggling to keep up and the previous king of low cost, Iceland, has had to seriously up their game to compete
This makes me sad
I live in Wales I’m so fucked
Destroying statues is literally just washing away history, both good and bad
If they actually cared about the meaning behind statues include plaques saying the context behind the individual don't destroy culture and history completely

Thank goodness for that
You do realise that he's on the run right
Pretending he doesn't exist doesn't mean the attack didn't happen
Which it will
However he was on the run so releasing his photo and sharing it is vitally important
Read the fucking news before making your tired cliche comments
It is cliche, everyone says the same crap over and over "don't share pictures, names, motives" yeah we get it, you don't want the attacker to have notoriety but sadly the world will never work like that
It's important we know who these people are and why they did it
Sticking your fingers in your ears because you simply don't want to know the issues or reasons for these attacks does not do anyone any help
Groups Wales in with England

Wales doesn't even have a sentence for it, and to be fair that's probably about right for this
That one
That's the one right there
That's how to get punched by someone Welsh
He then would spout some fat insults to the Irish language no doubt, man wasn't subtle with his love or hate

Then you could drain the North sea and then reclaim doggerland
Even before Schengen most of the borders in Europe were pretty much open
In my merchandise touring days the only border you could be guaranteed to be stopped at was on the way to Berlin via one of the corridors which ran through East Germany
The rest were a wave through or even no border guards in place
God I love Ed Miliband
No I wouldn't jump on it in a heartbeat, because it would obviously be a tax-avoidance loophole
Don't assume that because you're ok with fucking over your fellow citizens for personal gain everyone else is
> Would you pay more money in tax than you need to
That's a leading question
It implies that every method of tax avoidance should be pursued simply because your government hasn't explicitly closed that loophole yet
I pay the taxes I owe and take advantage of any legal deductions that are offered to me
What I do **not** do is actively search out loopholes to avoid paying as much
Giovanni Strazza probably couldn't either without practice
To do things like this you need to practice for decades
People vastly overstate the importance of natural talent
Natural talent will help you learn a skill faster and could potentially give you that extra 1% that pushes you from "artist" to "master".
But the first 99% is practice
If Giovanni Strazza had worked in a field for 20 years and then one day tried to make a sculpture it would look just as terrible as any of our attempts
24 C is too hot for me, good luck muchachos
Yeah that's nice and all but the Romanian neighbors I have up stairs are incredibly noisy
The buggers have elephantine footsteps and are noisey as fook
Without the E.U I'd be poorer sure, I'd loose my freedom of movement, digital privacy rights, comprehensive human rights and the ability to enjoy my beloved German beer
but at least I'd have a decent night's sleep without their midnight meanderings and random noises keeping me up at night as they wouldn't be here
**Unhappy sleep deprived remainer noises**
For me, homosexuality has only existed as a label in recent human history
If you look back into ancient history, there was much more fluidity within relationships, so what we would now consider to be gay men and women would quite happily have children via the standardised methods if they were feeling broody, but still have their lovers of the same sex
I'm not sure when society fell into this mindset of "Oh, if you're gay then you cannot do x, y and z, because only straight people can do that," as it seems at odds with the desire for producing progeny, which is generally universal to differing degrees
Perhaps the key to true equality is to drop all these labels and just be who you want to be
Czechia played a central role in the Thirty Years War
Remember some parts of the HRE lost 50% of their population to a spat over religion
It is how it was in the UK
Their children will say no religion and half of cultural Christians end up saying no religion as well
Cultural Christianity has always been a transition state to a non-religious norm
Yeah using concerns about Islam as a trojan horse for naked racism is heavily watched for because it is very common

Sorry guys, seeing this picture reminded me of a skit on a old british comedy show called the fast show
Which one
You can win the campaign if you end on favourable terms
For example the Malayan emergency resulted in independence, but the communists weren’t the ones to take power, instead it was a peaceful transfer to a government favourable to Britain
Same thing with Irish independence, transfer of power was relatively favourable to the UK, with parts of the island that wanted to stay remaining with the UK, along with the free state remaining firmly under UK influence
Everyone was happy, right
The free state has a lot of freedom to this day, but it is still cooperates closely with the UK, I personally feel that Irish independence was inevitable after the way it was treated under UK rule, might as well have the government of the country be amenable to UK foreign policy
I am being sarcastic and was referring to the troubles, I imagine if the UK had ‘won’ and refused Irish independence that there would only have been a longer, bloodier troubles
A ‘megatroubles’ if you will
Now you’re being pedantic, we both know I’m speaking of the republic, a state which happens to be free
> Would you be saying that if the UK had won the war of independence
I probably would be saying that, a long winded counterinsurgency would not be worthwhile for the UK
Besides, the Empire quelled many rebellions in its foreign territories that it later ceded peacefully later on, just look at the entire decolonisation process, the UK could’ve kept the empire had it used force only, but diplomatic pressure from abroad meant that the independence movements could succeed peacefully
I believe Ireland would’ve been able to get independence eventually, just like how Scotland most likely will get it soon
That's Marine A's wife
'Marine A' is Alexander Blackman, a former Royal Marine who had been found guilty (in 2013) of murdering an injured Taliban fighter (in 2011)
The Taliban fighter had been injured by an Apache Helicopter
When Blackman's patrol came across the fighter, Blackman ordered the injured fighter to be moved out of sight of a British surveillance balloon
Blackman shot the injured fighter in the chest, saying "shuffle off this mortal coil you cunt
It's nothing you wouldn't do to us". He then told the other members of the patrol not to mention the incident, saying "I just broke the Geneva Convention".
On 15/3/17 a military court reduced the conviction from murder to manslaughter, on the basis of diminshed reponsibility because Blackman had been suffering from [adjustment disorder] On 28/3/17, a civilian court reduced his sentence to 7 years, and due to time already served, he will be released "within weeks". The judge said that although Blackman did have diminshed responsibilty due to his mental illnes, he still bore a great deal of responsibility
Blackman has expressed regret for his actions, and the lightness of the sentence is a reflection of an otherwise immaculate record
The Uk contributed a lot to the EU though, you can hardly call a net contributor dead weight

I grew up in Cumbria
I'm surprised our county isn't in red
I worked alongside social workers who had CSE prevention on their brief
Basically, it was a hot potato and would get thrown backwards and forwards between YOT teams and duty teams
I helped put together a 'neutral' team to whom reports would get sent so they could allocate them to specific support workers in tandem with police liaison officers
Led to huge successes in smashing a lot of gangs targeting young girls
Then they disbanded the team because of budget pressures and we were all forced out
I & people on my team suffered mental health problems because of the stuff we saw & there was no support from the authority
We tried taking action against them but the union & their legal partners strung it out so long and then said they couldn't do anything & councillors played deaf, dumb & blind
Last I checked, CSE rates were back up to historic norms in the area and the hierarchy are like
"Whyyyyy
" Meanwhile, those of us who did something about it have been broken
I work for minimum wage in a factory now; my confidence is just gone
Wall of text yes, but it gives you an idea of why the problem persists; when people do succeed in doing something about these problems, there's always seems to be an institutional/hierarchical  response that fucks that system up
I'm not given to conspiracy theories,, although given that one of the senior managers heavily involved in the downfall of our project was subsequently found guilty of accessing sensitive case information on our system to support her paedophile husband who was jailed long term around the same time for abusing children while he was a social worker
well, draw your own conclusions
I could write a book about this stuff
There was a massive child abuse scandal involving some children's homes in North Wales
It was in the 80s and 90s though, so it's mostly under Reddit's radar

My country's politics is more entertaining but less believable than Game of Thrones

The primary anger against the EU is basically people blaming Brussels for Tory policy
So Cameron would have to stand in front of the camera and say "Brussels aren't screwing you
We are screwing you and a damned fine job of it we are doing too" to defend the EU
I wouldn't say the EU is neo-liberal
To be neo-liberal you basically need to be in favour of ever decreasing market regulation
The EU is much closer to German ordoliberalism
It used to be pulled between German ordoliberalism and French dirigisme
The entry of neo-liberal UK pulled the balance more towards the German position (arguably ordoliberalism is the centre point between dirigisme and neo-liberalism)

Hey don't worry man, I as a Brit get it
Having seen and experienced first hand how easy it is to get a hate mob going I really do get it
There was a lot of bullshit said during that referendum campaign and since the vote things have been said in anger from the E.U side and the UK brexitier  side that have polarised things even more
I hope that things get averted tonight
I hope Boris Johnson gets booted outta office, article 50 gets withdrawn and some goddamn GROWN UPS get to hold the reigns of power in the UK but I know that's still a far off possibly
I just hope in 15 years time when Britain finally sees sense you'll forgive the idiots here in the UK and we may continue where we left off back before we in the UK decided to succumb to this delusional dream that the gammon brexitiers hold
I think Brexit is an idiotic idea and I don’t want to go

I’ve been watching a lot about early civilisations lately and they are all truly fascinating
It amazes me how human society and governance almost immediately became as complex as it is today from the very moment we started building the first cities
The amount of parallels you can draw with the lives of ancient and modern people is astounding and it makes me wonder how much of a modern person’s life could be replicated in an ancient city
