I’m far too proud of my country to know of anything really dark about Iceland, and scrolling through here I see no Icelandic comments
If any Icelandic fellas see this please lmk if there is a dark fact
Or wealth has been given to the corrupted rich and moved abroad with full backing of the same party that's now doing nothing about Iceland's first case of corruption and exploitation in Africa
Not the same, but in Iceland the Danish rule has been generally regarded to have been tyrannical and Denmark is not portrayed particularly positively in Icelandic history classes
I'm very curious, do the Danish teach anything regarding Iceland
I'm mildly surprised to see Iceland mentioned here
The Danish rule over Iceland is generally regarded to have been tyrannical by Icelanders and the greater part of Icelandic history classes are devoted to this period
Icelander here
All four of my grandparents were born and raised in Iceland under the reign of a Danish monarch and both of my grandfathers were citizens of the Kingdom of Denmark by birth, as opposed to citizens of the semi-independent Kingdom of Iceland, like my grandmothers who were born a few years later
It really isn't *that* long ago
Spain I hate the heat and it seems like a good choice
Just make sure Räikkönen isn't at home
When every leader was fighting each other and then getting taking over by Norway
No shit, druing the Stasi era, the level of authoritarianism and population control was very real
Then somebody opens the borders by mistake and the whole thing collapses
It just goes to show that power is really just 90% appearance of power
Thanks for the additional information
I was just simplifying it a bit
The fact still remains that East Germany lost their power base *really* quickly after the people got free movement
I'd rather die than listen to older icelanders try to speak english
I agree
Out of all the accents English can have the Spanish accent is not annoying or hard to understand at all
Same with the Dutch accent, usually you guys don't have a strong accent compared to Germany or E-Europe for example
It's been a few decades since I sounded like Björk but she did us Icelanders a real favor breaking the ice
I can't understand why some people find it charming
sometimes I use "got stuck in the tunnel" -everybody knows there is no drive-thru tunnel in Reykjavik
The guy that brings awful smelling food and occasionally farts so bad that it disrupts traffic
All the waste and no concern for the environment
It really irks me
And how the 'greed is good' mantra has taught many people how they shouldn't give a shit about others
And all the serial killers
This is especially funny since American toilets are WAY louder than the European ones
Gudrun is so common in Iceland
Hjördís Yrsa sounds like a very normal name in Iceland hahaha
I have had some moments like that, but I have also experienced the opposite, where I thought a group next to me was speaking in Icelandic, but once I started listening I realized that I didn't understand a word and that they were, in fact, speaking Finnish
Ah, this is interesting
Icelandic and English are very similar languages grammar rules seen, so that this sentence sounds not to bad
Interesting thought, know not how different combination words is in Icelandic compared with English but well it worth to try
All the tourist traps being closed
Haha how could anyone ever forget about the Icelandic empire, sitting at the top of the world
I'm very sorry about that
This years contribution was MUCH better
"They" even claim we were about to win
or was that the Will Ferrel movie
hmmm
But how prevalent is Iceland in everyday life in Norway
We get news from Norway (and the other Nordics) regularly, mostly about politics
I’m always surprised when somebody outside of Iceland knows Ásgeir or Ólafur Arnalds
There are around 20 thousand Poles in Iceland so we never forget about you ;)
And was that Iceland
Iceland is an import dependent western nation
Most "common" goods are found in every supermarket
Avocados have been trendy here for a while, so you won't have to go without your daily one
It's probably going to be four times as expensive as it is in Mexico at the lowest, but it's there
Heyyy “without any cultural influence on daily life” :’(
[Theres a theory that one of our volcanos caused the French Revolution ]
He should be
I agree
The profit from our fisheries is now in tax-havens
They've now advanced to moving Africa's profits there too, of course to Icelandic hands
The company Samherji has been plundering Namibia as of late, bribing ministers and hiring their family members
our old friend nepotism, now African style
There are people in prison in Namibia because of this but the investigation in Iceland has been suspiciously/typically silent and sadly nobody is expecting justice for the Namibian people
Her grandfather was also the king of Iceland when she was born
I cringe every time I see these guys
You correctly marked them sorta NSFW which is how most people feel about them
but the whole contest from beginning to end is heavily geared towards kids so kids would be emulating HATARI, going as them to fancy-dress-parties and for Halloween, totally normalizing BDSM
I found it extremely weird how comfortable people here were with their kids emerging themselves into the bdsm-punk concept, googling bdsm and
learning from it
> Fun fact: Clothes at Hennes & Maurits (H&M) here has price tag in NOK and ISK
Yeah same in Iceland
>After looking a bit at mbl
is, it seems like you get more news from us than we get from you
That's probably because we're a smaller country and these 24 hour news websites need something newsworthy to fill the hours so they often look abroad, mostly US and EU but also the Nordics especially since most of us have relatives living there
We also get a lot of football news from Norway and the rest of Scandinavia because of the number of Icelandic players playing there
Mhmm okay
And German bier is way overrated Pißwasser, which lacks varieties and flavours
Oh we're very crafty, you should see all the Chinese and (native) Indian costumes that have been made up here from something your mom/brother/granny had
If someone's uncle had a Judo/Karate suit it was considered a legit costume
My mom made me be a house cuz all we had was a box
As expected I'm waiting for a strongly worded letter from an architect
True, I forget often that people will read this :p
Like the English word ombudsman just confused me so much
In Danish it's a normal word but in English I don't even know how to pronounce it or what it means exactly
The only thing we think about german people ís that
They are efficient, great beer drinkers, and quite friendly people
Same here in Iceland
We pride ourselves is the quality of our tap water
Bacteria killed with UV light so there's nothing added to it
We had a big scandal a few years back where the owner of a small boutique hotel told his guests not to trust the tap water but instead sold bottled water in the rooms
Bottles he filled straight from the tap
Not in Ireland but I asked for a glass of water at bar in Manchester and I could not finish it because of the taste of chlorine
It's only the hot water that smells/tastes and only in the old part of town, where nearly all the hotels are located
We never drink the hot water and don't use it to brush with
The hot water smells in some places where we still use water directly from the ground, half of Reykjavik and it's neighboring towns have hot water that's heated cold water so that doesn't smell at all
The old part of town where nearly all the hotels are located have the old system, which is why nearly all tourists think our hot water smells
The cold water is very clear and mildly alkaline at pH8, in Reykjavík it's a mix of rainwater and lava-filtered groundwater
Wearing your outside shoes indoors, seriously who does that
Calling the icelandic horse a pony just because it's small, that might not be true for everyone though just people that are into horses
Jokes about accidentally sleeping with your cousin, we have a small population but we know our cousins
Edit to add:
Off-road driving is illegal and people have been fined and made to fix what they ruined
The landscape is delicate and there's been a lot of work in the last few decades to grow the areas that are full of sand
When icelandic people talk about off-road driving it's not off-road driving, we follow paths that should be visible to just about anyone
Saying anything that’s even remotely sexist, racist or ableist
People WILL call you out on it and it’s NOT tolerated
Do not, and I mean do not, go into hot tubs or swimming pools without showering properly first
Oh yep this, so much this
I’ll put jelly worms on my lasagna if I want to
Yes, every year there are a few articles about tourists driving off road, especially on the black sands in the south coast
There are of course some icelandic idiots that drive off road but mostly it's tourists that I hope just don't know any better, but some people just don't care
Here are just a few that popped up on Google:
[August 2020]
[ 2019]
[2019 again]
[2015]
Yes
Sometimes I wear shoes but ONLY if the home owner says it's okei, I usually take them off anyway because it just feels wrong
TIL
Icelandic history is voefully missing being bombed
Oh God
The Icelandic team in D2: the Mighty Ducks
That was just, yikes
To this day the only actually good Icelandic I've heard a non-Icelandic actor utter is a [Taiwanese advertisement for bottled tea] I mean, they have an accent, of course they have an accent, but the language is clear, concise, correct, and even if the tonal inflections are wrong they are wrong in the most adorable way
Jonah Hill takes the trophy for the [worst accent while still giving a decent amount of effort] It's not that he's doing a very bad job, it's just that he is having a really hard time with the phonology so he uses weird vowel choices and muddled speech
You can kind of understand him but it's still really hard
His co-actor in that scene however is, while stilted, quite understandable: so good job there
90% of other "Icelandic" I hear in films and TV shows might as well be Vonlenska, the made up language Sigurrós often sings in
Utterly incomprehensible, riddled with grammatical errors, or an english-speaking actor just saying Icelandic words using english phonology and stress patterns
Marvel was pretty bad at that to the point of not even trying
Non-Icelanders speaking Icelandic is so rare that I just feel flattered, even if their accent is strange
An example of this is from the danish tv series [Ørnen - en Krimi-Odyssé] at the 3:00 minute mark
His Icelandic is perfectly understandable, even though it sounds off
13 Santas
All of them stalk you or break into your house, steal your sausages and lick your greasy pans
Not exactly the ideal red and white Santa but atleast you wake up with a random gift in your shoe 13 times lol
Oh and there's a giant black cat that murders kids if they don't get new clothes
Eatings
Ah yes, thanks for elaborating
We don't live in igloos or believe in elves ! just stop asking ..
There was an interview some time ago with Jessica Biel about how her husband Justin Timberlake excels at everything he does
One newspaper decided to translate that story but something went awry during the translation so the article in Icelandic was about how good Justin Timberlake is at using the Office application Excel
The article was deleted but I found this [screenshot] The headline is: "Can't live without Excel-documents"
Right now it’s 11 degrees and raining
You guys have fun this summer
As usual Iceland is save from this recent ascend in temperature during European summers, it's currently 11 degrees Celsius and raining where I'm at
Doing just fine here in Iceland
Hot weather is not one of our many problems
Highest ever temperature was 30
5°C in 1939
20 degrees are not common in Reykjavík at least but it does happen but you'll have 20 degrees somewhere in Iceland every year
Most summers it's around 10-15, can go lower, can go higher
I'm fine lmao
Thanks
Hope you are doing ok as well
>Denmark gains very little from the financial support we provide the Faroes or even Greenland - it is a net economic drain - and yet, time and again, we effectively get spat on and pushed away
The Greenlanders are by far the worst here, but it's present both places
sounds like denmark has a findom fetish
now fork up some cash little paypig, daddy has to get a new phone
One more question for the educated man:
When are you benevolent Danes planing on returning the rest of the treasured Icelandic manuscripts you're still refusing to let go of
I can't understand him speaking, just one and one word but I can read the text and get a pretty good idea what's it's saying
First one was easy for me but the second was a little hard
Yet you returned the Codex Regius to Iceland in 1971, I wonder what your reasoning for that is
When the two countries parted ways in the 20th century, whatever Icelandic artifacts stored by our then mutual government should naturally have come under Icelandic ownership
Most of your countrymen know this and that is why you've already been persuaded to return two thirds of those "royal gifts". Just as the UK, you will eventually have no choice but to return your illegitimate and colonial artifacts
>You say they were colonial
No - read better
Besides, Árni Magnússon wasn't just any "local" but a professor of the University of Copenhagen, on the kings' payroll to carry out various tasks in Iceland
This is the context in which the manuscripts were collected, donated and lent to the collection
Any talk of gifts here is misguided
It was only natural that the Icelandic scholar, who collected the Icelandic manuscripts in the Icelandic, left his estate to our only existing university library
No doubt he intended the collection to be preserved by the state, *not* by the Danish nation
The fact that this gift-argument is the only one you have illustrates the situation well
I’m not exactly an expert of the different towns in Iceland but according to google it’s Þorlákshöfn
Never been, can’t confirm
“For something to be of worth something else has to be worthless
And when it comes to the town and villages in Iceland the fishing village of Thorlakshofn is both ugly and a pretty worthless place to visit
Average Icelandic day :/
It's also a thing in Icelandic
I had no idea it was weird until some foreign exchange students pointed it out
According to the gpi we’re the most peaceful country in the world
London
You start in a small gang with limited access to guns, but then you level up and get access to more advanced Weapons and locations
The game then ends in a mission stealing the Crown Jewel's.
Well yeah, but why not again
I mean you have to admit that it's pretty outdated
Gotta be careful of that Covid-19 whistle
I liked it
Also liked Schloss Neuschwanstein
And Dinkelsbühl
haha money printer go brrrrr
I visit Gamla Stan for the old houses tbh
Don't have many of those over here
I write it as 'a'. However it often tends to look like a 'z' due to the way I write
Too late, we're over
I just saw Svalbard the other day, hope you're enjoying your new slut
Of course, I hope the people of Belarus stay safe and force some positive changed
I know of It mostly from Reddit
Stay safe out there dude
I don't know what we can do over here but good luck
How over polite you guys are in service jobs
It doesn't come off as friendly it comes off as fake
An American called my job the other day and the minute I said hello he just bombarded me with words
"Hi my name is Kevin I'm calling from blabla how are you this afternoon
I didn't know how to respond to that because I'm not used to this type of conversations
Viðey island 5 minute boat-ride from Reykjavik, it's old monastery, tiny church and bird-sanctuary
And then of course pretty much the whole of the country is a hidden gem if you don't count the Golden Circle
The West and especially the West fjords receive the least amount of tourists
Stay out of the South if you want to avoid tourists
Kaka is cake in Icelandic and kúka (pronounced cooga) is to poop
The car Kia Kuga is a little funny in that way
Although we don't share a language I imagine we get *a lot* more news from Scandinavia about their internal affairs than they do of ours
Denmark or Norway I think
We have midges and they do bite
We have mýflugur but they are almost entirely in the north
> freezing temperatures and dark
Trust me, it wouldn't be the dark and cold that would break you in Iceland, it would be the goddamn wind
The other Scandinavian countries are generally colder but calmer
And I'm not necessarily talking about storms, like the few we have most winters, I'm talking about the *non-stop* wind, like every day, all year
My favorite days are the days where there is no wind
Wind makes everything worse
Hey I can answer that for you, some mosquitoes make it to Iceland with planes and tourists perhaps, but they never make it to lakes or something like that to lay their nasty eggs because of strong winds here
Es ist nicht so schlimm
Wenn ich kann deutsch lernen dann kannst du isländisch lernen
Cześć! Poles are the biggest minority group here
Around 20k I think
Split between poles who have settled here and started families, and Poles who simply come to work and then go back to Poland to buy a house etc
I attended school with many poles and have worked with a fair share
So I guess you could feel at home here
Some Poles I know struggle with Icelandic but others speak fluently or at least very well
I'm pretty sure Polish is more difficult but it of course depends
You as a native speaker of a slavic language might find it more difficult to learn than a native germanic speaker would, but don't let that discourage you
If you really want to make it happen do it
Summer is the best time in my opinion (if you can handle sleeping with 24hr daylight), spring can be very rainy
I totally agree
There are some Polish people who have no interest in and hate the country and its people
The most annoying thing about SOME Poles is when they speak no english and no icelandic
When I was working in any customer service job(f.e cashier at fast food or grocery stores) and trying to figure out what the hell these people were trying to order, them speaking polish to me and me speaking icelandic and english back
Really frustrating
But then again with every group of people they have every shade of grey
You'll find assholes, nice people and everything inbetween
I personally like Poles in general, and have gotten along really well with many Poles in my workplaces over the years
Spring is ideal for you then, but keep in mind
it'll be cold and rainy
but green
No there are more Poles they're about 4% of the population while Lithuanians are about 1,2% plus I have never met anyone from Lithuania in Iceland
Yup, you'll have a heck of a time, I'm sure
Not exactly the same kind of situation, but I remember a funny incident that happened to me and my friends when we were traveling in Amsterdam
We were sitting at one of those, ehm, delightful coffee shops they have, and suddenly we hear a loud American rambling about how “he doesn’t understand how people want to visit Iceland when they’re traveling to Europe
It’s so far away from everything, it must suck
” We all smiled at him and said “hey, we’re from Iceland
” His face was priceless
I actually think he felt super embarrassed about it because he started saying something like “yeah, I’ve heard you guys got some proper strongman there” (we are all pretty big dudes)
We thought it was super funny, I’m sure he was not expecting four Icelanders to be sitting next to him
We didn’t blame him, we do get bored of being so far away from everything
If he could learn Hungarian I think he deserves some money
I’m pretty sure he had seen [this] video
So do I, but every once in a while you get the urge to leave for somewhere else
I think it's a requirement in Iceland
I wouldnt consider it cold until it got below 5°c, though wind is a massive factor
Same for me, an Icelander
Anything above 14c is T-shirt weather (if the wind allows)
I’m currently wearing a thick jumper around outside now and the temp is going from ca -2/0c in the morning up to 10c
The worst here is December and the longest day then is only about 5 hours
Sunrise is around 11 am and sunset between 3 and 4 pm
Sounds kinda depressing but at least during the night you can see sometimes northern lights and because it's December a lot of places are lit up with Christmas lights giving nice atmosphere
Yeah, there's some social life of course but usually I just hang out with friends at their place or mine, don't go out much to any bars or something like that
And Stöðvarfjörður
Whoa how did you end up there, those villages are indeed kinda boring
Sounds nice
I'm just surprised a bit that they sent you to the place in the middle of nowhere but anyways I'm glad you enjoyed it
In Iceland big balls (stór eistu) would mean you had a medical problem or a saggy sack
How much did you win
Iceland has among the lowest smoking rates in Europe, around 9% of the nation smokes
It's a gateway drug to lung disease
The young people being admitted to the ICUs are vapers
I read somewhere that a chemical in some vape-fluid hinders the white-bloodcells in the lungs, thus more pneumonias amongst vapers
and now Covid deaths too
Here young people do it and it was/is considered cool but to be totally honest it is mostly a habit of people that work manual labor
"Columbus discovered America
Icelanders: NO HE DID NOT
When they say things like, but its because they have such á low headcount, their culture ís homogeneous, oh they are an isolated island whenever we manage to accomplish anything of note and people are dismissing It outright
Yes Í know maybe some of them have the occasional point bút it stíll annoys me to be só blatantly dismissed if we do anything good
That is the line that has been adapted here too
Same for us
They're all from Holland in Icelandic
I still don't know the difference, but I sure know how to pick a fight with a Dutch guy
Is there still a lot of communication and trade between Portugal and Brazil
I presume you guys understand each other more or less
or what
If horses leave they can’t come back the island
Why do you say that
No like leaving the country
Yeah the Icelandic horse the only horse that lives here
They are legally not allowed back to Iceland if they go to another country
There are some laws that say that horses can’t be brought to Iceland and Icelandic horses can’t be brought back
We have á few here in Iceland
There ís sprengjudagur(exploding day) where we eat salted meat and meat soup until we explode
There ís öskudagur(ashday) where lifa dress upp and sing fór companies
There ís bolludagur(no idea how to translates that) where kids attempted to spank other people with ceremonial apankers and got á sourdough ball with chocolate on top and whipped cream and jam in the middle fór each time they managed it
Though that is mostly just shortened to people eating said sourdough puffssourdough puffs
And whipped cream on It
Oh and there was the day when á foreign man arrived and conquered Iceland for á few weeks
We call It hundadagarnir
Though that isn't really celebrated
Hmm well i guess not letting black soldiers into the country during WW2 while the British were "protecting us" but like that's the worst thing I can think of so yeah
Nothing really compared to the bigger countries who have long histories of wars and conflicts with other countries but all I could think of was the Slaying of the Spaniards
Basially in the 17th century a Basque whaling ship sank off the coast of Iceland and one thing led to another and a local sherriff put out the order that all the whalers be slaughtered
Dozens of these poor shipwrecked whalers were massacred in brutal ways, tortured their genitals mutilated, eyes gouged out etc
The funny thing is is that the sherriff wrote it into the Icelandic laws that Basque people were to be killed with impunity
Also Turks for the Turkish Abductions (even though none of the abductors were from Turkey)
Those laws were only taken out of the lawbooks sometime in the last century I think
Every year a person is sacrificed to appease the volcano gods
They show themselves to remind us of their existence
Can you imagine how much worse it would have been without the sacrifice
In Icelandic:
(Sun) Sól / hún sólin (female) (Sunna is sometimes but rarely used, also female)
(Moon) Máni / hann máninn (male)
But the more commonly used word for the moon is Tungl / það tunglið (neuter)
The sun is feminine (sólin)
The moon is neutral (tunglið)
Fucking Anders Behring Breivik man
As an Icelander, I'd like to thank the Faroese for just being so darned awesome
They're definitely our favorite cousin out of all the nordics
I've never met an Icelander who dislikes the Faroese
Thank you USA
With the Marshall aid and your invasion in WW2 we would still be the poorest country in Europe
I second that
The Faroese have been there for us through thick and thin
Færeyingar eru nú meira en bara frændur
Mér þykir ótrúlega vænt um þá.
Jamms
Meira eins og litlu bræður okkar
While there May be some grumbling here and there we still very much look upon the danish ás our cousins and support them whenever they and not us are competing
Same with áll the nordics honestly
We are taught English and Danish as second and third language, then later on we can choose between German/French or Spanish
And I’ll have you know that we are 360k people thank you very much :D
First we belonged to the kingdom of Norway in 1262 and then came under Danish rule in 1814ish (and became a Sub-Colony as they liked to call us) and then is the history of the Klamath Union and all that
Hahah quite all right mein gut Freund
We generally love Norway here, look at them like a big brother
And Denmark
it’s complicated
Long story short It’s mostly water under the bridge though haha
Anarchy
Good golly sir
I’ll have you know that we were a [Commonwealth ]
Our allegiance was to the Republic, to Democracy
And thats What hurts the most
[being forgotten]
And Well you guys sometimes forget about the Faroes Islands too haha
[“This is the third time in five years, that the Danish public either flies the wrong flag or displays the flag on the wrong day
We still love you guys though, but as I said it’s complicated
They know who they are
Heyy, we’re just an island
At least you're remembered
Most likely Denmark
Yes
Thank you u/freecandyforkids69
Thanks for the nice thought haha
But yah we're tiny, can't evan think of a country that could be a wannaby rival
\#Very Finnish problems
There's also a nearby galaxy that is gonna collide with ours in about 4

Icelandic: Dýna (mattress) Danish: Dyne (duvet)
Icelandic: Sæng (duvet) Danish: Seng (bed)
Considering that bed and mattress are almost the same thing, it’s weird that these two things got swapped around
Seng in DK is bed
Sæng in Icelandic is duvet (down)
Dyne in DK is duvet
Dýna in Icelandic is mattress (matras in dk)
&#x200B;
Bonus- when offering the last coffee from the pot Icelanders ask:
Viltu börnin
Do you want the children
Translated from Danish: Vil du bøne(r)ne
I absolutely LOOOOVE living in Iceland
Our society is for the most part a well functioning one
The only thing that sucks is how short the summer is
Ireland has also been sending me vibes lately
I find it appalling how little interaction we Icelanders have with the Ire given that most of us have 40% of our dna from Ireland/Hebrides/Orkney/Shetlands .
I want to see where the princess/slave/free-woman Melkorka MyrKjartan's daughter was from, she's a major player in one of our most beloved sagas Laxdæla
before Covid there used to be, we had to import people from abroad to service all the tourists
Unemployment was under 5%.
Right now there is unemployment because of Covid but I'd say that when you see the unemployment numbers go below 8% you should be able to find something (depending on your resume of course)
We're a part of the EEA (EFTA) so we're members of Schengen and the internal market
It’s alright nobody has really tried to conquer us except Norway and Britain
There’s a lot of ocean and not much else
Sounds like Iceland most of the time  at least we save a bunch on sunscreenn
Perhaps it helps to keep in mind there is a place a bit further north of you where actual people live who have to suffer much darker winters
The howling January winds and the short days
Hahahaha yes I think maybe even 6 or 7 in the whole of Reykjavìk/capital area
In Icelandic:
Að tefla við páfann (To play chess with the pope)
Oh my yes, we have stories about trolls who could eat you or drive you mad, or just plain kill you, or occasionally sex you
You have stories about elves who could kidnap children and replace them with changelings, or drive people mad
And of course outlaw
It’s considered normal to get drunk on the weekends, nobody will blink an eye if you’re wasted out of your mind on Friday and Saturday night

Hunted into extinction, the last bird being caught in 1844
[Meanwhile in Iceland]
On an unrelated note: There are very few billboards in Iceland in general, and I don’t remember seeing any with a religious message
In any case, I’ve never witnessed this sort of “religious aggression” here
[Relevant comic by SatW]
“ Religion is a very private thing in the Nordic countries and not something you're supposed to tell others about, both because most people aren't religious so it would be considered rude, and also because they're such personal feelings for religious people
So a sure way to ruin the mood is to wear a T-shirt with a religious message, or any other object that somehow show what religion you belong to, most of all because Nordics will probably be too polite to talk about it (like I said, you're not supposed to talk about religion), so it will be a huge elephant in the room and they will just sit and stare awkwardly at you, afraid they might say something that'll hurt your religious feelings
The Faroese, it's very much like Icelandic but some of the words will have surprising meaning making for a lot of social gaffes and funny misunderstandings
Danish/Norwegian are also fairly easy to me, Swedish less so
Maybe færeska, and I don't know if it counts but we can still read ancient Icelandic texts without too much trouble
Am Icelandic
I understand almost everything when I read the Old norse language because it is what modern icelandic grammar is based on
I can read faroese and understand most of it but usually there are some words that are weird/different
I can also fairly understand written danish, norwegiand and swedish, like if I read a sentence I can understand like the gist of it
>  shit hits the fence
Do you mean "if shit hits the fan"?
Also, good bread is most definitely something I associate with Germany
Only thing I can remember is when I was sick from school one day and I was watching the channel that had the best daytime schedule (old school classics like Fresh Prince and Alf and Whose line is it anyway etc) and the broadcast was abruptly stopped because of a big fire in down town Reykjavík.

Never mind those Austrians in Copenhagen, you are rightfully referred to as mainland Iceland
side-eying in metric
Here's my list, only man-made:
* Colosseum (Rome, Italy)
* The Eiffel Tower  (Paris, France)
* Øresund Bridge (Between Sweden and Denmark)
* The walls of Dubrovnik (Dubrovnik, Croatia)
* The Large Hadron Collider (Geneva, Switzerland)
* The Channel Tunnel (Between France and The United Kingdom)
* Acropolis (Athens, Greece)
Iceland is lodging a complaint
We've got fjords *and* volcanoes *and* glaciers *and* black diamond beaches
Top that Norway
I don't know, I just find it amazing that humans built something that connects two nations by building a tunnel under the ocean for 50+ kilometers
It may not be as pretty as the Øresund Bridge, but I find it quite wonderful
Probably true, however the Colosseum is just so well known that it probably trumps the others, it's also amazing when you think how short a time it took to build
From an engineering perspective it is quite cool, one of the few places I've been to that really makes you appreciate the engineering of the classical era
It is also so well preserved that it merits the place imo
The eiffel isn't everyones thing, however it is one of the defining features of Paris, and probably one of the most famous landmarks in Europe
I agree that there are more beautiful items, even in Paris, but this one is on the list just because of how extremely influential it is
Have you been to Iceland lately
Global warming is treating us kind
I still don't know why people say that, we definitely have forests
haha trees don't even exist, might as well brag about having dragons if you wanna go all mythological
The Blue Lagoon is excess water from a nearby power plant

not very glamorous when you say it like that
There are lagoons in Iceland far more beautiful that I would put on a list if we're searching for natural wonders
(Google "jökulsárlón site:reddit
com/r/mapporn" if you want examples of one such lagoon)
Gabon is 87% covered in forests so I guess Norway doesn't have forests
For Iceland it is
Norway
Denmark
United Kingdom
United States
And then no one really stands out for fifth place, it could be any one of these: Faroe Islands, Greenland, Ireland, Canada, Sweden, Russia, Germany, Poland, Turkey, Basque country
Norway
Denmark
Britain
Greenland
France
We are so young of a country that we don't really have much
Also in 1262 we fell under Norway and then later we fell under Denmark
In school we don't learn much about after we fell under Norway, so this is mostly before that
For Iceland I'd say
Denmark - in effect colonizers, enforced monopoly trade and crown rule
United Kingdom - business through the ages, WWII occupation, Cod wars
Norway - where most of us came from, shared culture
USA - 20th century influence, NATO, Navy base, tourism
France - fisheries and trade through the ages, until DK cut off trade under threat of corporal punishment
And weirdly **not** Ireland, despite 30% Irish/Scottish blood running through our veins
Since the slaves were captured and brought to Iceland in 800-1000 CE (and probably some Irish settlers being assimilated), there has been weirdly nonexistent relationship between those two relatively close neighboring countries
Why India
Do you mind putting the reasons behind each country so outsiders can understand why these relationships are important
That's only if you're counting recent times
In the middle ages there was so little contact with the Inuits of Greenland with either Denmark or Iceland
Icelandic trade funded much of the Copenhagen we see today
Typically the mayor of CPH was a part of the Icelandic monopoly trade which was enforced strictly so Icelanders were forced to do only business with their regional merchant who set the price and didn't pay out in money but store credit
This is a very dark time in our history that we feel Danes know very little about
It's like other colonies seeking recognition for the wealth that was moved to colonial Europe
Basque sailors frequently fished in Icelandic oceans
They sometimes talked to the locals of the Westfords in the [Basque-Icelandic Pidgin] And there was once a conflict between these groups that ended in a [massacre of the basque sailors, the last one in Iceland’s History]
You can see my other reply
It’s technically not Turkey, but a misnomer
[The Turkish Abductions] were naval raids on Iceland by pirates from the Mahgreb and Berber regions, mistakenly thought to be Turks from the Ottoman Empire
They took some people as slaves and some of those slaves eventually returned and wrote some books about it
This event is slightly important in Icelandic history, everyone is taught about it in Iceland, and even some Turks in Turkey are taught it
The French used to come here to fish
There was a hospital in the small fishing village of Fáskrúðsfjörður that has been made a museum and it was really interesting to go there
This is simply not true and is a fine example of colonizers turning history on its head
The Iceland trade was highly lucrative and merchants had to make bids to get them
The merchants got to set their own price and did not pay with money but 'store credit'.
This revisionist view of history is simply ridiculous
Let me correct you here, this is not just the work of Guðmundur Hálfdánarson but scholar after scholar that's done work on the subject including
It is utter nonsense that there was "nothing of value in Iceland" as you claim, **Iceland exported live sheep, Eider down (for the duvets of European royalty), massive amounts of pickled/salted herring, dried salted fish Skreið, massive amounts of shark liver oil that was considered the finest burning oil in European cities before the existence of gas lighting, eggs, smoked birds, seal hides and wool, in addition to guano and sulfur for the making of gun-powder
On top of that whaling was a lucrative industry that was mostly conducted by foreigners in Icelandic waters but whale blubber oil was also highly prized as lamp fuel that didn't smoke, just like the shark oil
There was not only taxation that was supposed to cover operations for the King's men in Iceland (the Danish overclass) but the profiteering was primarily done the monopoly merchants that sold Icelanders crap products while buying products at dirt-cheap prices, especially fish
Then we have the king claiming assets like when the king restricted or even banned Icelanders from going out to fish in their own waters because he considered the fish 'his fish'. Overfishing was of course not a problem at the time while over-whaling certainly was
Many of the richest people in Denmark were Iceland merchants and they got rich because of it
Copenhagen mayor Mikkel Wibe got insanely rich off of the Icelandic trade, Mads Hansen who built a mansion on Ströget funded by Icelandic trade, as were the houses of Nyhavn where a Danish Iceland merchant lived in every other building
Niels Örum and Jens Andreas Wulff furthermore made lucrative deals off of dirt-poor Icelandic backs and so on and so forth
Ther Östre Landsret building on Bredgade was in part financed by Iceland trade to name one of many buildings in Copenhagen specifically built off of the trade as is listed in Guðmundur Andri Thorson's stroll-books on Copenhagen
I could literally spend all day listing resources but most of them aren't available online
The main perk of this union was 'free' education for the few boys that could afford loding for year's stay at the University of Copenhagen, young men that would then serve as Iceland's priests, king's representatives or doctors
You've shown here this very real **Danish myth** that somehow Danes didn't benefit from entering into the union with Iceland which is demonstratively false and a way of whitewashing the atrocities that were committed in times of dire need, especially from the 1500's to 1786 when an eruption and following famine wiped out a good quarter of the nation and the monopoly trade became unenforceable due to famine
To give your past countrymen credit the citizens of Copenhagen sent barrels of rye following the 1783 eruption as well as the people of Trondheim in Norway
Add to these harsh conditions a very strict feudal system, enforced by the crown's men and rich farmers which meant people could not move/switch workplaces without permission and then only a couple of days a year
Because Iceland didn't have trees large enough to build ships it was forced to accept the mostly unilateral terms that the king set them, but contrary to popular myth before the monopoly trade there was quite a lot of trade with the English, French and Basque whalers that traversed Icelandic waters
But these ships of course did not accept passengers and due to a small population Icelanders needed to go abroad to study
I urge you to educate yourself beyond the basic Danish school books on the subject
The way Danes have portrayed themselves as the saviors of the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland is a myth at best and an attempt to whitewash cruel colonizing practices at worst

The Faroe Islands is Icelands little brother and only ally against all of you landcrabs
None, we are a lonely distant island floating around aimlessly in the Atlantic Ocean
I feel like the "our country-foreign countries" dichotomy is pretty big in Iceland, going to the "outlands" is a big deal and many people make a big deal out of travelling, you can't just drive to another country
If pressed I would probably have to say the Faroe Islands since they're in a slightly similar position
But they still feel like a distant cousin you see once a year instead of a brother
If you want an actual country then I'll say Norway
Fun fact, Icelanders are the only foreigners allowed to serve in the Norwegian army
Said someone
Looking forward to the very day it happens
Iceland has no standing army, and there is rarely any military propaganda in the media and many people are anti-war
So the number of Icelanders living in Iceland going to Norway to join their army is probably under a hundred peopld
My guess is that less than 10 people would join every year
Icelandic youth is just much more interested in getting an education and a high paying job
Personally I don’t know anyone in Iceland who has joined the Norwegian Army
That’s why I was so shocked to hear that my Half-Icelandic, Half-American nephew was joining the U.S. Air Force at only 19 years old

I would like to specially thank our BFF, the Faroe Islands
They've proven many times to be the best neighbours anyone could have
Poland (and the Faroe Islands) were the only nations to give us a loan after the devastating economic crisis in 2008, so I also thank them
There are also a lot of Poles here in Iceland who are great folks and have helped us building up our economy
Norway has helped a lot with regrowing trees in Iceland
Norway had an annual tradition for many years to give us a massive Christmas tree for the main square in Reykjavík. Nowadays we can chop down our own tree
The USA is obviously not part of Europe, but they helped us declaring independence and gave us a fantastic statue of [Leifur Eiríksson] (who was most certainly born in Iceland, looking at you Norway)
Færeyjar and Poland for their help in the economy crash in 2008

Rhotic:
*Djon meid his vei tú a tavörn þrú ðe dark forest ónlí tú fænd át ðat hí forgot ðe moní.*

Well the two main universities are the University of Iceland (HÍ) and the University of Reykjavík (HR)
HÍ is public, around 470 euros for the year while HR is private and costs 1900 euros for the semester
HÍ is easier to get into (except for medicine) while HR is more strict
You can learn anything and everything at HÍ while HR is mostly computer science, engineering and law
Which one is more prestigious, I don't know You could argue HÍ because of the faculty of medicine, they tend to do whatever they want and are highly respected
Many view HR as very snobbish because of the tuition fee but honestly I think we judge the prestige of a person's education by where they studied abroad (e.g. Oxford, Harvard etc
etc)
Exactly this
I would say that rankings aren’t everything and people look too much into that
I for example went on Erasmus to Universität zu Köln and was not happy with the school, the way of teaching felt old and outdated additionally they were way to focused on their ranking above anything else

We don't have mcdonalds, but when we did rúv (bacicly BBC of Iceland) did an april fools joke that a curch was supposed to be redesigned because it looked too similar to the mcdonalds logo

Do you say ristavél or brauðrist
Both mean toaster but ristavél is "toasting machine" while the other is "breadtoaster".
I don't care what word people use but I've seen some heated arguments over this
Also "pylsa" or "pulsa". It means hot dog and "pylsa" is the correct spelling but a lot of people pronounce it as "pulsa" angering the other side that pronounce it like it's written
In Iceland its what you call a hot dog
Pylsa or pulsa

Can't really think of anything right now other than there is this unspoken understanding that you have to learn a foreign language
Because if you don't you're pretty much stuck at home since nobody's going to speak Icelandic abroad
It is sort of an obligation, some large coutries don't deal with this as they are larger and offer stuff right at home small countries don't have
Also foreigners tend to view us like some exotic animal that creeps me a little bit
Man, I really want to give my two cents but can't think of anything

Yeah, and IIRC the Danish government actually sends us money every year because we have that in our curriculum
Don't ask me for a source, though
Danish is spoken by a pretty decent minority of people, probably mostly by people who have lived there at some point in their lives
Could be 10% or something, I've never seen any stats on it
To add to what Veeron said, it depends on the generation
The older the generation the better they are at Danish but worse at English and the other way round for the younger
So my generation overall isn't good at Danish
The people that stand out usually moved there/studied so they don't count
For me personally (25F) I can understand a little bit as long as it's something simple and spoken slowly, then I can get a context
But even then, accents determine how much I understand
This also applies for Norwegian and Swedish
We don't have a military, there is no Icelandic army
Nato does however have a base here that's mainly run by the nordic militaries and italian pilots

Very similar but not quite the same
One example is when the city of Reykjavík decided to turn an old army barrack/nissen hut into a restaurant/café. Original estimates said it would cost the taxpayer arond 158 million ISK but it turned out to cost over 400 million and that includes purchasing decorative, designer straws from Denmark for 750k ISK
The type of straw that was bought grow in the wild in Iceland btw
Not as bad as many other examples in this thread but it was all a bit farcical but it worked out in the end and it has opened, marketed towards tourists with overpriced burgers and the like

And we ask relatives to buy us cheaper alcohol from the airport :)
It’s definitely Appelsín here in Iceland
An orange soda similar to Fanta but better
Also it’s a christmas holiday tradition to mix together Appelsín and Malt (maltextract) for a festive drink
Malt is non-alcoholic sweet malt drink
We have several
Mix is a pineapple tasting fizzy drink that is somewhat like a less sugary mountain dew
Malt was originally a stomach medicine but was later turned into a soda
It takes some getting used too
Appelsìn is an orange-flavored soda that was originally created for the u.s troops stationed here during the war(or so the story goes) and due to war shortages couldn't get any soda from home
Appelsín, its a simple orange soda but its definitely fairly popular
.Also maltextrakt which isn't exactly a soda but is kinda similar to one, its somewhat similar to kvass and you can mix it with appelsín for a classic christmas drink
We have similar here in Iceland [Egilsmalt og Aðplesín]
Its a Christmas drink
mmm, my favorite drink in the world is this organic Danish ginger drink and now I'm dying to try the Italian Ginger
To trade I can only offer you the Icelandic Appelsín, a rather refreshing orange pop made of concentrate
I have never tried it to be honest
We have about as many "notable" voice actors as all of the voice actors in skyrim

"Úti í rassgati" OR "out in an asshole".

Reykjavik is nearly 2 times off it's natural schedule, but instead of starting things later we force ourselves to wake up at ungodly hours

This one was confusing for me as an immigrant in the Netherlands when buying a baby stroller
The salesman kept saying how you could attach a Maxi-Cosi to the various strollers he was showing

Hmm yeah kinda
Dragon is dreki while a kite is flugdreki which means "flying dragon" - then you got tank which is skriðdreki and translates to "crawling dragon". We also refer to the Hippocampus in the brain as dreki
Yes
Dragon = Dreki
Kite = Flugdreki (flight-dragon)
Driving outside the road in the nature
it seriously damages it, and causes a big fine up to 1000 $
i live in Iceland and this is sadly a common thing amongst instagrammers and other crackheads
Driving off the fucking road and trespassing
it's most commonly referred to a as Landsbyggðin
Not derogatory
We (Iceland) have “Landsbyggðin” which just translates to land settlement
It isnt a derogatory term but it can be used in addition to another word to add that insulting factor
Oh I heard this great story second hand about a rather famous gay PoliSci professor and his former Mr
Iceland boyfriend who entered a subway cart in Tokyo early (late
) Saturday morning after a long night of techno clubbing
Friend of a friend worked as a programmer at a Tokyo company and was reluctantly on his way in for work this early morning to finish up some project
Enter the odd-couple on their way back from the club, engaging in heavy petting and pda with graphic descriptions in Icelandic about what was going to take place once they got back to the hotel
This friend of a friend stayed silent and pretended he didn't recognize them, but as he exited the cart he turned to them and said in Icelandic "Have fun guys" (Skemmtið ykkur vel strákar)
He said they turned instantly mute and pale

There is a lively stoner culture here and the local weed is potent
All those green houses being put to good use
Still the cops monitor electric use and fly over with thermal cameras to detect farms
More and more people are willing to decriminalise weed, mostly thanks to the local Pirate party and hemp-orgainzations
I don't want to be snooty here (yes, shhhh, I secretly do) but is it generally the lower classes that start adapting those baby names
I remember some 20-30 years ago when every other kid in certain groups was named Aaron, which is not just a very foreign spelling to the Icelandic language it's also a weird new Biblical reference in a dominantly secular group
I doubt many of the parents even knew where the name came from
His mamma got him in, her line is where the name came from
I fled Iceland after the crash of '08  for a few years, have returned now
Iceland is pretty awesome imo, despite the weather
Shout out to my ancestors for barely surviving on this hostile rock until modern technology made us prosperous
We went to Denmark, it was overall pretty nice but we weren't exactly welcomed considering Icelandic venture-vikings had just had a few big bankruptcies there too
Copenhagen is lovely 9 months a year, December to February it was terribly cold, the kind of cold that bites you to the bone
you're right, modernity arrived when we were occupied by the allies in WWII
Before that industrialization was very slow and pretty much limited to trawlers and Reykjavík.
In a century Iceland has gone from being one of the poorest countries on Earth to one of the richest countries on Earth
My grandfather wrote his memoirs and it describes poverty on an imaginable scale
I feel so grateful for my ancestors for hanging in there so I can sit here in my warm bed with a full fridge and still order pizza
Probably the highlands maybe some beaches outside of Reykjavík
Not a big deal unless maybe by some people if that person would have a non-Western last name or anything-other-than-white skin color, although that's something that would more likely trigger people outside of Iceland

Oh, is that why Iceland's population is like 15% Polish
They tried to lend us some money, even though they had very little themselves
It wasn't the effectiveness of the help that matters, but the solodarity

It’s incredibly stupid and absurdist
Sometimes it’s self-deprecating but other times it’s making fun of our massive egos
It’s often also dark and dead-pan

Yes and no, he is not as evil today as he was, we can't be scarring all the children now days
Also most children get some clothes before Christmas so they are safe from the cat just in case
We still teach children about it, but it’s done in a more humane way than when I was a kid

Iceland is really weird because the Capital Area has 2/3rds of the Icelandic population (Reykjavík is half and the other surrounding towns has the other half) so if we would go with a population focused move it would be Akureyri, which is in the north of the country and is the largest town that isn’t in the capital area
Another idea might be to move the Capital to Álftanes, since the eternal home of the president is there, called Bessastaðir
That’s still in the Capital Area but just a bit farther from most of it since it’s on a weird peninsula
Also the town Álftanes doesn’t really exist anymore because they merged with the neighbouring town Garðabær, so it’s kind of weird
You could also come from the historical angle
Alþingi is the oldest continuous running parliament in the world (with a slight pause mind you) and before it moved to Reykjavík like everyone from the countryside did, for the longest time it was held at Þingvellir, you could move the capital there
Well the problem is that almost nobody lives there, it’s just a few houses and cottages scattered about and it’s mostly a open rocky place and a tourist attraction
But the historical angle isn’t really telling because before 1700 almost no place in Iceland had more than 500 people, the population was so incredibly scattered around so the idea of a capital was laughable
Maybe we should put it in Keflavík where the international airport is, but maybe let’s not since that place is a wretched hive of scum and villainy
We could put them on the largest and most populous island Iceland has, Vestmannaeyjar, and then just forget about it
We could put it in Selfoss, or maybe Hveragerði, honestly I always forget which one’s which
Probably Akureyri which ís á lovely town that sells hot dogs with exotic ingredients on them
It's also the largest town apart from the capital area
It ís fairly small mind, only 20000+ people instead of Reykjavíks 160000+(adjacent towns included), but at least we would be free of áll the politician
Or Kópavogur, because it is the center town in the capital area

I keep stopping tourists from buying bottled water here in Iceland
A couple of years ago there was a huge scandal here in Iceland where the owner of a small 'gay hotel' had signs up saying that drinking tap-water was unsafe but they conveniently had 'safe' bottles for sale at the hotel instead
Bottles that the owner had filled up himself straight from the tap
One of the main reasons his hotel was a 'gay hotel' was that he had read that gay guys had more disposable income and would pay more to stay at a 'gay hotel' so he marketed it as such
The other reason was that he didn't want to deal with kids staying for free in their parent's rooms

Absolutely, we have emphasis on letters so you hear them
Eyjafjallajökull (pronounced correctly) is an example, you hear the emphasis and pronounciation and you write according to that
For the most part, yes
Although recently because of the current pandemic the word "sóttkví/quarantine" has often come up and I frequently misspelled that as sótthví in the beginning
Yep islandmountainglacier translated to English
I think it just reffers to Iceland it self because anything else just wouldn't make sense to me

Hæ, ég heiti Jón, ~~ég vinn í kassagerðinni~~, mikið er gaman að hitta þig
Hvaðan kemur þú?
Hi, me name John, much is fun to meet you
Where come you
The most dangerous animal
We don't have any big predators here, the largest possibly being the fox
Maybe the sheep since they sometimes cause accidents when they cross roads
Generally the wildelife ís the least dangerous part of Iceland
101 Reykjavík for Iceland imo, the movie that jumpstarted Baltasar Kormákur's career
Nestlé headquarters
No, but you got the spirit:)
That it is the closest thing on Earth to Old-Norse
That's why I said "closest", all languages change
Languages that are influenced by other languages change faster than languages that develop in isolation
No one Icelandic here yet
Well here I go
Darkness so much darkness, (today the sun rises at 10:30 and sets 15:52) lovely
Expensive
So fucking unbelievably expensive
I believe that we are the most expensive county in Europe and we only have a population of 360
000 people
The currency is unbelievably unstable it goes up and down up and down like in a rollercoaster
Like if you think negatively about the Krona it goes down
Banks are awful, by I mean loans are disgusting here and by that I mean I can take you forever to pay off a loan (40-50 years for a house/mortgage) or for car (10 years or if you sell your car + loan)
We have something called “price index loansl” “index linked loans” and I think these types of loans are illegal according to EU because they are too confusing for the regular average joe to understand
(Somebody please corrode if I’m wrong here)
And similar like one Finnish dude said here somewhere, few families seem to own everything, they own the fish in the sea, own the super markets, oil service stations, real estate, and other huge companies etc and sometime seem like they are playing their own version of monopoly
So yeah these are the cons I can think of, there are some pros too of course
Yes, mostly though cronyism, nepotism and political corruption (but that’s perhaps not that much compared to other countries)
I myself have used clientelism to get a job, otherwise I would not have gotten the said job at that time
I prefer though to get a job on my own values
Hahaha Thank You
[My favourite Icelandic Disney song ]
Because of the loaning system we have due to the instability of the Icelandic króna, indexed loans and non-indexed loans
[about financial indexation ]
[all loans in Iceland  and interest rates ]
Sorry this is in Icelandic, but I think you can read out of this about how high loans are here
[Here you can apply for a loan at Arion bank and see the loans and rates]
You can pay up to maximum of 40 years but that really depends if not another travesty happens to our financial system, and if you want to pay for 30 years or less then you have to have higher wages and pay more of course
[price of property in Iceland ]
Sorry I’m on my phone typing this
Perhaps, maybe, You think that might explain the corruption
Haha
Plenty of it
We are so few, government officials are often caught helping out friends and family members
I clicked on Galician and I actually understood it pretty well
It’s also an option to simply tell your neighbors that you’re having a party and then people will chill out a bit
The former Vice Chancellor probably played [this song] on the way to Ibiza
Hahah thats awesome, I would have gone to that concert
I'm gonna pretend that greenland counts
They eat the entire animal and i respect that
Agreed, Danes are truly the masters of this
The Icelandic phallological museum
The national history museum ís pretty good though Í have to give á shoutout to the penis museum
Saw this on askreddit
If there was a scratch and sniff map of Europe
What would be the smell of your country
[the original on ask Reddit ]
Damn you guys make Iceland rents look cheap what the hell
Hahah I would say pretty accurate from my experience at least, plus every time I went to Greece, the garbagemen went on strike
so also some garbage smell on a hot day
Hvað væri okkar lykt
Oooo I’ll have to try this
Interesting, I would like to try that drink some day
We have [Brennivín] it’s strong and nasty haha
Same, except our smell has rotten shark haha
Love the smell of peat (Icelandic, Mó)
Your description makes me even more want to visit Ireland
Kæstur hákarl, brennisteinn og kannski soðin pylsa
Haha
Hahahahahahaha jà!!!
It could be
There’s all kinds of things you could find in hot-dogs
I’d be surprised if it didn’t have any hooves in it
My family owns a house in an old village where people have been living for hundreds of years
It's almost a complete ghost village now although there are a few dozen people still living there, and it's very much out of way as the ring road doesn't lie through it so no one enters unless they have business there
It's very comfy
Yes
The medicinal properties are great and CBD really is a phenomenal substance
CBD can be a perfect replacement to many legal and otherwise harmful drugs and treatments
I'm not too fond of THC as it is psychoactive (CBD however is anti-psychotic) and can in many cases make users very psychologically dependent (speaking from my own experience and people I know)
But nonetheless for recreational use I think it should be legal and regulated like alcohol
Personally I think all drugs should be legal and regulated, or in the very least be decriminalized with a huge focus on harm reduction and pure substances
Addicts need help to recover, not punishment
Also it doesn't matter if drugs are illegal or not, people who want them will always seek them out, where there's demand, there's supply
I loathe the people who are selling, shipping and manufacturing drugs in the criminal underworld
Most of them are just ice cold brutes
With legalization you take away their biggest playing field, and people have a safer alternative in a legal and regulated market
And just for the record I'll gladly discourage anybody from alcohol and drug use
I'm an inactive addict myself and I've gotten a taste of how bad life is living with addiction
But that still doesn't mean I think prohibition is the right path
I doubt full legalization could ever be a thing but at least decriminalization
We are not even a part of EU
Sorry to hear you where disappointed
Á can mean river, sheep, "own" and "on" in icelandic
And a farm can be named Á (river)
Which means "Á á á á á á Á" is a grammatically correct sentence
Ó and Á, they are expressions of surprise and pain respectively
I mean "Á á á, á á á á" is a grammatically correct sentence here meaning: Ew, which is grazing owns an ew on the farm River
That's the thing, the only party that benefits from this system is the one that doesn't want to pay more to people
It's like they say was the case in old Rome when they thought about identifying slaves in some way, that if the slaves realized how many they were they'd revolt
I remember once when I had the salary talk with the only other person in the company in a similar position
She was taking on slightly more responsibilities than me
so she turned around and asked for a little bit less than me
Infuriating that she wouldn't try to pull us both up but settled for less, keeping us both down
I'm with you
We Icelanders are fairly open about these things but there has to be 'a moment' to ask
Our salaries are officially open (during a small time window) and then top-earners by area and industry are published so we try to keep the rich a little less crooked with transparency
This way we know what businesses/industries can afford to pay high salaries which gives young people information about where to seek a career and where we might be able to go into business ourselves
Plus too much income inequality has been proven bad for societies and transparency helps make sure the rich can't pretend they can't afford to pay taxes
I believe we have to apply for access during tax-return-season (first week of August) and then we get an assigned time slot where we have to physically go down to the Tax/Skattur offices and then we can only view the last years returns
There is only a small time-window when the tax-log is presented but I'm not sure if they've denied anyone entry yet due to time restrictions but I wouldn't put it past them
The right-wing governments of past have done a great job curbing our right to this information
Most people wouldn't get any of this info if the magazine Frjáls verslun didn't publish it every year
I try to buy and save a copy for future reference
psst, get yourself a fair
See instructions on the right
I'm not sure whether we fall under it or not, but since we have both a Prime Minister and an elected President that has to sign all law I'll answer on behalf of Iceland
In theory it was supposed to create checks and balances, in reality the role of President is almost purely ceremonial and cultural so the system does not work as intended
Because of tradition our presidents have rarely postponed or denied to sign a law and thus referring it to the Icelandic nation for a national referendum
It has happened all of one time when Ólafur Ragnar (1996-2016) refused to sign "The Media Law", but instead of a referendum the PM's government pulled the law and started working on a new one
Before that Vigdis Finnbogadottir (world's first female prez) wanted to postpone signing a law that would force stewardesses back to work when they were on a strike
The government passed this law on "Women's day" when the whole female population went on strike and Vigdis didn't want to sign the law until the day after, because she could see the symbolism
Patriarchy did not take that sitting down and threatened to turn in the coalition government's mandate
So instead of calling their bluff Vigdis caved in
A lot of women have never forgiven her for that
I presume they expected this kind of BS from men at the time
So overall the role of President is mostly meh
yes, at least everywhere I've lived in the Nordics
Maybe there are exceptions in some areas
Not sure about Sweden though, anyone know if the hype real about how unsafe Malmö and parts of Stockholm are
If you want to combine these two categories together then I think the most fitting country is Iceland
We consume less alcohol than most other European countries due to incredibly high alcohol taxes and a state-run monopoly on alcohol, probably the most expensive alcohol in the whole world
And we're also incredibly secular
I think a study recently showed that basically no one under 25 believes that god created the world
Church attendance is minimal
Political matters are almost never religious
Only reason why so many people are still a part of the state church is because it's automatically registered and people don't bother changing it
I’m trying to wrap my head around that statement
If we are the most sober nation in Europe, then something is wrong with this continent
Some youngsters buy Landi (Icelandic moonshine) from shady people
Funnily enough I have two friends that have gotten into brewing and fermenting their own beer and wines
But I don’t know if it’s that common
We can read texts from 1000 years ago rather easily
We read the old sagas in unaltered form in school
There are some old words, but we understand them easily
I once saw a YouTube video by a Norwegian linguist, where there was a conversation between two people in what they reckoned was in old norse
Every person I showed it to took about 10 seconds to "align" their brain, and could after that follow the conversation
The Icelandic language seems to have stagnated while the rest of the north evolved, possibly due to influences from german
Icelanders have a lot more trouble following norwegian, sweedish and (god forbid) danish than old norse
As an icelander I can pretty much confirm this

We have a lot more trouble following Norwegian, sweedish and (god forbid) danish
We also read some of the old sagas in school
A bit hard to understand sometimes but manageble with the help of a teacher hehe
But yeah I've heard the same, that Icelandic is the closest to what the vikings spoke
Also we have protected the language a lot and always added new words rather than taking them from english (although english has had a great influence on icelandic youth culture today)
We study danish in school, for years, but still cant understand them when in Denmark
I think danes dont even understand each other
I've noticed that we share some words, we say *naut* in Icelandic
If you're eating beef it's called *nautakjöt*.
Haha it just means wednesday in icelandic
The correct form is miðvikudagur, or mið (middle) viku (week) dagur (day)
The day in the middle of the week
It used to be óðinsdagur (same as onstag in danish) but one of the bishops in iceland didn't like that and changed all the names of the weekdays
And yes, I assume its related to the English mid-week-day, English is full of germanic and norse influences
The accent closest to late old Icelandic would probably be "harðmæli" spoken in northern Iceland, primarily in the northeast, since it is a little bit more conservative
It is characterised by a rather clear pronunciation of p,t and k. People speaking with "harðmæli", for example, make a distinction between "sóti" and "sódi, which speakers of "linmæli", the vast majority of Icelanders, do not
Other accents like "flámæli" in the east and "vestfirska" of the western fjords are more innovative and thus not conservative
They're also virtually extinct, unfortunately
There's also the "hv"- pronunciation in the southeast where a distinction is made between "hvalir" and "kvalir", a rather conservative pronunciation, but it's also rapidly dying out
If you learn to replace them or might be easier
You can  just ignore 'ð' and imagine it's 'd' , ignore all the accents (éáíúýó) and replace þ við th
I think Norwegian has the ö(or ø) and the æ.
I can’t find any statistics on it but Reykjavík hasn’t always been the most populous town in Iceland’s history
A couple of hundred years ago it used to just be a small village, but now it has 2/3rds of the islands population (counting all of the capital area)
Same here in Iceland but it's been increasing over the last decade ever since Eyjafjallajökull accomplished decades worth of promo with one transAtlantic shut down
There used to be more but they've mostly died out
People from Akureyri prononuce some words a little bit differently but that's about it
Icelandic is kinda a dialect of Old Norse so it doesn't have many different dialects, maybe some people pronounce "ég" different but that's it
Some northerners pronounce some words differently but it really just stays the same
In Icelandic they are called "franskar kartöflur (French potatoes)" or "franskar (frenchies)" for short
We have that, mostly just cooking
I remember one class where we learned how to shine boots
Iceland definitely
Can neither confirm nor deny that
I can understand Swedish 80%, Norwegian 90%, and some Danish 70%. German is harder
Mainly Nordic languages seeing as how Icelandic is the closest related to Old Norse
Icelandic 100%
English 100% obviously
I am Icelandic and lived in Denmark
I under stand Swedish, Norwegian and Danish written language but only Danish in speaking language
Only recognise the connection words in German
The Dutch one was easier then the German, didn't really understand it but a little more then German
Low German and Bavarian didn't understand a thing
Afrikaans was very interesting but didn't understand it except for one word here and there
English I do understand and speak way better then I write
Icelandic I of course understand fluently
Faroese and Icelandic are really similar, I can understand Faroese really well
I understood almost everything
Yeah, it’s incredibly tough for a non-Icelander to read Icelandic and it’s much harder to comprehend someone speaking it in my opinion
Yeah but that doesn't mean I was good at it haha
During the World Cup it goes something like; Iceland first, then Denmark, and WHEN (not IF) they get knocked out, France
Yes, all the Nordic countries if Iceland isn’t playing
The nordic country (Norway,Denmark,Sweden,Finland)
No one haha
Our Icelandic "svindlmiði" has absolutely no ring or cleverness to it
Cheat=svindl miði=ticket
Million = milljón
Billion = milljarður
Trillion = billjón
Quadrillion = billjarður
So the same as in German
People often mix up "milljarður" and "billjón" so they use "billjón/trillion" when they're really talking about "milljarður/billion".
E.g. Jeff Bezos is worth 184 billjón dollars
This looks like it makes sense since he's worth 184 billion dollars in English but in Icelandic this translation would mean he's worth 184 trillion dollars
lol my bad
Beauty and nature
100% of energy produced is renewable
Also kind of an old language
Vikings and cold
Highest Internet use per person rate and us being nords
My country's name is a lie and our languages has changed very little over many years
We also have fish
Pathetic
China's authoritarianism will be exported to the entire West if we do not stand up to their shit
They are setting a dangerous example others WILL follow
I hated learning your numbers at school, just added a whole new level of difficulty at class haha
Where might one find such recipes
I’ll try my best haha
Thank you
Super, i will check this out
According to Spotify its these three:
Stjörnurnar]
Esjan]
Í kvöld er gigg]
Other popular songs that are played A LOT  on the radio are:
[Já það má]
[Sólarsamba]
[Takk fyrir mig]
[Það bera sig allir vel]
[Bernskan]
[Dýrka mest]
Probably either:
Herra Hnetusmjör - Stjörnunar [
Ingó Veðurguð - Takk fyrir mig [
Ours is quite meh
To much God
Not something you'd find in a dictionary but "Voffi" is sometimes used for dog (hundur) in Icelandic
Voff=woof the sound they make
It's mostly kids that say this but I've heard many adults use it as well
So while making popcorn, the popty ping pops until it pings
Perform or have if you’re using more formal words
The French and the way they protest so much
I know about those and you they make me sad, but I’m mostly looking at protest aimed at the government it’s like sometime they can’t breath a little and then there is a protest going on haha
While politicians can do all types of shit here and nobody blinks an eye
Nope wasn’t us
We did it after the financial crash 2008-2009
We kept us warm by burning down a Christmas tree and some random innocent bench
That is true
Buttttt it took a long time to get them to prison and they didn’t get that long of a sentence additionally they went to a luxury prison with a golf course (wish I was kidding)
And yes the pm went away with his tail behind his legs
but then he made an comeback with a new party and is now back in parliament
We do it also here
I have taken group selfie with some policemen, that is to say if they aren’t busy then it’s no problem
Oof thats awful
But I know that If protesters get mad here and violent they’ll get scared mainly because they are not used to us being furious
We mostly burned down Christmas trees and benches and put a flag of a pig on the parliament building
Brennivín, or burned wine
I asked my dad and it has a strong cumin taste, it's our version of a schnapps or aquavit and is around 40% alcohol by volume
Not really
Maybe because it's another germanic language or because we don't dub anything except childrens material here in Iceland, so alot of exposure
I learned the language mostly through video games and movies/tv shows

Only thing that comes to mind are jokes of “Hafnfirðingar”, those who live in the town of Hafnarfjörður
The joke always features a man from Hafnarfjörður and they do something wrong or stupid, and it’s usually set up as a question
I only heard these jokes when I was pretty young
For context, Hafnarfjörður is the third largest city/town in Iceland with 27k people
Just behind Kópavogur and far behind Reykjavík, they’re all in the Capital Area
I have no idea why they got chosen to be the butt of jokes but that’s just the way life is sometimes
Examples of jokes:
Usually on milk cartons there says “open here” on a top corner of it
The Hafnfirðingur interpreted it that he had to open the milk right then and there in the grocery shop, and did so
Why did the Hafnfirðingur put a chair up on his window before he went to bed
Well so the sun could set
How many Hafnirðingar can fit in an empty bus
One, because then it isn’t empty anymore
Why do Hafnfirðingar always sit on the closest bench to the cinema screen
Because they want to be the first ones to see the movie
Conversation between two Hafnfirðingar:
H1: You know what happened to me yesterday
I was stuck in an elevator for 3 hours
H2: Well that’s nothing, I was stuck in an escalator for 5 hours
Why do Hafnfirðingar always laugh so much on Easter
They’re finally getting all of the Christmas jokes
What do Hafnfirðingar get when they go to a prophet/mind reader
Refunded
Do you know why Hafnfirðingar never eat donuts
Because they don’t know what to do with the hole
Why do Hafnfirðingar always sneak quitely past Pharmacies
So to not wake up all the sleeping pills
Then there are tons of other Hafnfirðingar jokes that don’t translate well and only work in Icelandic
Hafnarfjörður, cause everyone calls them stupid
Each part makes fun of the other but I would say the west like who's from the west
Omg já
For me personally it’s [grjónagrautur] served with lifrarpylsa
It’s boiled rice pudding served with an Icelandic haggis
Yes, it probably came here with Danish cookbooks like so many other dishes
Edit: [Confirmed]
Most country names in Icelandic are similar to other languages, made to fit Icelandic spelling and grammar
Most of the differences are in European countries
Bretland - the U.K. (Literally just Britain)
I don’t know why we have never called them something like “Sameinuðu Konungsdæmin” (literal translation of United Kingdom), but Bretland is just really short and easy
We call the people there Bretar
Holland - the Netherlands
Yeah yeah you know the story, but actually saying “Niðurlöndin” just sounds incredibly wrong
Svartfjallaland - Montenegro
This one’s just literally translated: Svart (black), fjalla (mountain), land (country/land)
Hvíta-Rússland = Belarus
Just literally White Russia
Þýskaland - Germany
This one isn’t that interesting because it’s similar to scandinavian “Tyskland” and also the german “Deutschland”. But what’s interesting is what we call the Germans themselves: “Þjóðverjar”. “Þjóð” literally just means nation
And I think that “verjar” is an archaic word for men (my first guess was defenders because “að verja” means to defend and “verjandi” is a defender)
So in Icelandic, Germans are literally called Nation-Men
Svíþjóð - Sweden
Nation of the “Svíar”
Bandaríki Norður-Ameríku (BNA) - United States of America (USA)
In Icelandic, united and states are just one combined word, and we call americans “Bandaríkjamenn” though sometimes people ‘wrongly’ call them “Ameríkanar” or “Kanar/Kanamenn” for short
I don’t know why we had to specify that it’s north america though (Norður)
Germany = Þýskaland
America = Bandaríkin
And that's all I remember off of the top of my head
It's not at all the most ideal hosts but if we qualify I'll get as behind it as I did in 2018
The winter aspect will be strange especially here but its often too shit weather to watch it outside anyway so that wont be too much of a shock
Well our food is SHIT, like just plain ol' horrible
I'm talking *sheepballs* level disgusting (yeah, we used to eat those and alot of us still do once a year)
Except for maybe a few dishes (we have the world's best lamb fx
so there is something good) we just don't have a lot of good food
Edit: Also hot dogs
It's not really *traditional* and when you think about Iceland it's not necessary something that comes to mind, but when you come to Iceland, you have get your self an hot dog
Food:
Skyr, Lamb, Puffin, Anything Fish related and Hot dogs
Drinks:
We have a lot of good Beer and a spirit called Brennivín which is similar vodka in a way
And water
Most bottled water I've tasted abroad is worse than tap water here, it's an absolute must
Heilaga rómverska ríkið according to Icelandic wiki
Seems to be a direct translation from Holy Roman Empire, although a more direct translation would be "Holy Roman State"
Same as in german and english
Heilaga rómverska ríkið
Yes, and the movement is mainstream, has governmental and public support
We try to not put loanwords into our language but make new words that make grammatical sense, or repurpose old words not in daily use
Sími = telephone
Tölva = computer
Sjónvarp = television
Skriðdreki = tank (military)
Sjálfa = selfie
We also don’t support many characters like “c, q, w, z” so they’re forbidden
Not the op bút yes we do use these, english slang isnt popular or even used unless you are still learning the language
It literally translates to crawling dragon so I'm afraid it is unrelated
**Jealousy** vs **envy**. I just learned the difference recently and see it used incorrectly all over the place
**Envy** means you want something someone else has
Example: I'm envious of my sister's new car
**Jealousy** means you're afraid you're going to lose something if somebody else get it/something else
Afraid someone else's glory is going to outshine yours
Example: I'm jealous of my brother's car because it makes mine look like shit
You can be both jealous and envious at the same time but they are different feelings
Not really
A few people are climate change deniers but they are few
Not at all
I was thinking about negative effects
The EU has impacted every country in Europe
This is the secret to our wealth too
Everything is so bloody expensive our salaries have to keep up with it
Then we behave like kids in a candy store when we go abroad
Oh the Swiss have mastered the old economic law that "if you handle loads of money you're entitled to a cut of it" - the same principle bankers all over the world use to justify becoming rich off of other people's money
Reykjavík: Grafiti, Tourists and bad traffic
So yeah we kinda need more city's but until then this will have to do
Reykjavík: tourism
And swimming pools
Ç'est interdit
It's fun to yell at someone and it'so one of the few things I remember from high school French
Jag anar ugglor i mossen, "I sense an owl in the moss" it's a Swedish phrase but it sounds silly to me
Szukam dziewicy
[Our 2017 entry]
In my opinion that is the worst one iceland has sent to Eurovison, but these two below are awful too
[2001 Angel]
[2008 This is my life ]
Öfund is Envy
Afbrýðissemi is Jealousy
Öfundsjúkur is Envious
Afbrýðissamur is Jealous
(sjúkur is sick)
Definitions are the same as you said but many people use them interchangibly, especially kids, they will say either word but they’re obviously meaning envious because they don’t understand jealousy yet
We don't really have dialects in Icelandic, there are maybe some minor pronunciation differences between for example folk in Akureyri (where I live) and folk in Reykjavík or the Westfjords but otherwise everyone is very much speaks similar
Faroe Islands on the other hand, every village seems to have a new dialect of its own
Here it is called the Pfizer vaccine but often stated it is an international effort between (Turkish immigrants to Germany and) German and American companies
Lets see
Takk/Þakka þér fyrir (Icelandic), Thank you (English), Takk (Norwegian/Faroese), Tack (Swedish), Tak (Danish), Paldies (Latvian), Gracias (Spanish), Merci (French), Danke (German), Go raibh maith agat (Irish), Gura mie ayd (Manx), A*čiū* (Lithuania), Hvala (Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian) Obrigado (Portuguese), Dank je (Dutch)
Takk fyrir ! You can add that to the list
There are so many choices, but I think I'll have to go with Reykjavík. It has hot dog bars, and many other things
Well, you could switch the browsing tab, (controversial, new, rising, etc)
Or just unsubscribe from the popular subReddits
Former Yugoslav republic, Slovakia
**Czechoslovenia**?
I spent a lot of time in Slovakia
When I mention this to people I meet here in Iceland, about half confuse the two
From Wikipedia:
*Sihamoni remains unmarried and has no children
His father Norodom Sihanouk stated that Sihamoni "loves women as his sisters".*
He’s gay
Icelandic and Danish
Born and raised in Iceland, mom always spoke danish to us but we answered in Icelandic
I never felt like a real icelander
But at the same time, I wasn't a dane
I just didn't fit in in Iceland
After university I moved to Denmark
I feel more at home here, even though I miss my family
Don't know if the Danes will ever see me as a dane
But who cares
I’m half Icelandic half English per se but I am Icelandic
I hate my dad lol so I don’t really embrace my British identity due to that
My mum was Icelandic and danish herself though and I grew up speaking Icelandic and danish primarily because my dad was barely around but I feel 100% from Iceland
I’m dying here this is my home
The central highlands of Iceland would fit that description
Iceland in general makes you feel like that
It's not really a thing over here, think american football may even be more popular
If there are any leftovers it isn't frowned upon at all, nowadays waiters will bring you organic boxes to take the food home with
No, we do this all the time especially with the kids and I am not leaving food behind just because it may be “ordinary” to take it home
Same in Iceland
You drink what you bring
We will always share if someone asks for one but you wont be popular if you show up to a party with nothing to drink and expect everyone to give you some of theirs
I imagine that that depends on the alcohol prices in the country I suppose
Beer will be available for guests in Denmark for instance (cheap, especially if you buy it on the German border) but in Iceland you bring your own (ridiculously expensive)
I suppose it also depends on the age of the hosts of the party and the size
A large party for high schoolers will probably be BYOB, but a working adult might provide bevarages for a small-to-medium gathering
Same in Iceland so a weird nordic country thing ;)
I live near the border and you can always assume that the host has drinks if it's even a bit formal like a dinner party
If it's an informal gathering, then the host usually has more than enough drinks for himself at least, but most will bring something anyway
But like i said, near the German border so a box of beer (24 small ones) is around 60 DKK
Ég elska þig (I love you)
Definitely not
We're in darkness for half a year so we enjoy the sun whenever we can therefore we like being tanned
Nah, if anything you get a bit shamed for being too pasty, even in the winter
There is a normal-curve of tan-ness, too pale and you look unhealthy, too tan and you look overcooked
We love them
It shows a person has bothered to learn our language
The only nation to not acknowledge that we put in the effort to learn their language are Danes who seem to think it is selvfölgeligt that we would learn and speak Danish
There used to be regional dialects but nowadays there's only the dominating Reykjavik accent and the harder Northern accent that's especially strong around Akureyri and Húsavík where Will Ferrell is from
Not as far as I lnow
I would make it Greenland, but only on the condition that the current Greenland changes its name to Iceland
And yes it’s because I’m tired of the joke
Ice "We're greener than Greenland" land
Germany
Not a fan of the culture overall, Nordics are cold so I am used to it but I’ve never encountered such a closed off bunch
I agree
That Covid response was a cold reminder of the calculatory decision making that led to their neutrality in WWII
I know right
I thought we were bland and boring Icelanders but the Germans are so linear in their ways
Very unforgivable
Not even the Finns are that bad when they open up
I mean, Vikings sailed a lot there and Istanbul was even known as Mikligarður
To this day Nordics are still raiding there, but nowadays we raid the bars and beaches and leave with a bad sunburn
I have never heard of such a subculture here
I lived in Chile for many years and there they have [flaites]
Tappar . Like the cap on a bottle . Basically the same as a jock
Bolur (Iceland)
I can understand Norwegian, Swedish is a bit harder, and Danish is easy because I learned it in school
Faroese is understandable written But it's harder when it's spoken to me,  German is almost completely unintelligible tho
What about Icelandic
Gaman að kynnast þér, hvernig hefur þú það?
For me Swedish is decently understandable written but I doubt it's the other way around for you
Interslavic has always fascinated me, is it really that good
Correct
I understood that quite well
Amazing how similar our languages are, all tied to Old Norse
Yeah that's interesting
The word "Korleis" is completely alien to me though, but I definitely would've been able to piece that sentence together
"Hyggjeleg" also sounds like the Icelandic word "Huggulegt", which means "cozy". Møta also sounds more like something influenced by english
Møta- meet
Just a thought
Ok that actually makes alot more sense when you mention it
And also you're right with words meaning different things depending on context
If we take "mæta" for example
Ég mætti klukkan átta = I arrived at eight o'clock
Þeir mættust fyrir utan húsið = they met in front of the house
Ætlar þú að mæta
= are you going to show up
Ég ætla að mæta örlögum mínum = I'm going to face my destiny
And also you got me thinking, maybe møta and meet have the same origin- mæta
Since Old Norse significantly influenced English
I'm no linguist but I think it might makes sense
Also one question as I was trying to look this up some days ago but found nothing
Many people have told me that northern Norwegians, mostly older people have no difficulty speaking to Icelanders(meaning them speaking Norwegian and Icelanders speaking Icelandic
) Is this some dialect
If so what's it called
Because as far as I'm concerned Scandinavians usually can not understand spoken Icelandic to any real extent, except maybe one and one word
Wow every single one was really difficult to be honest haha
Of course if they all had subtitles in each dialect it would've been easier but it was very hard to make out words, very thick accents
If I'm not mistaken I think the Hafslo guy was talking about when he got home he would lie down and read a book
Probably way off but that's what I gathered
And with the Setesdal example pretty much the only thing I gathered was the Bear and the Fox were having a conversation
Björn- Bjørn, Refur- Reven, that's a given
But to be honest they were all equally difficult for me
Á = River, sheep, owns, on
Yes I agree, silly isn't it
In a sentence:
Ég á á sem er á bát sem fer yfir á.
I own a sheep that is on a boat going over a river
I could be related, Icelandic hardly changed at all for hundreds of years, we can read 1000 old texts and get the general meaning
Ya this checks out
Source: I'm Icelandic ;)
The real question is
Is the sheep on the boat real
I think that all Icelanders would say first iceland than there city and than eurepe
Idk man, I kinda enjoyed taking birds away from the cats, at first I wanted to save the bird but man after I realised the birds are long dead I just wanted to punish the cats
Heh
I got [quite] [a] [few] [options]
I'm not sure where to start since pretty much all of Iceland is unique and worth the visit from the volcanoes and glaciers to black sandy beaches, glaciers, fjords and basalt columns
But [Breidafjordur in west Iceland] my absolute favorite, it is scattered by lava-islands and basalt columns that create a haven for wildlife, both on land and in the sea
The seafood there is phenomenal
If you ever visit Iceland make sure to take a boat trip through Breidafjordur, guarded by volcanic glacier Snæfellsjökull where Jules Verne said was the entry to the center of the Earth in his famous book and also the peninsula where Nobel author Halldor Laxness set his book (Christendom) Under the glacier
Personally I like it best because of the fantastic sagas that took place in the area where my ancestors plotted, fought and died and the hot springs that feed natural hot-tubs and swimming pools like [Laugar] close to the Elf-Borg in Sælingsdalur where [Laxdæla] took place
lol, yes it certainly felt that way
To have all these wonders within a couple of hours from Reykjavik is pure luxury
I hadn't realized myself just how unique Iceland is until I started traveling the world myself as an adult and got a comparison
I think right now is the perfect time to establish "direct" flights between Oceania and Iceland, I'd LOVE to come visit your unique world too
Pikk means dick in Norwegian too
There’s been plenty of snow
Thank you, but Icelandic does not sound soft or pleasant
Wish I could hear it through your ears . Everyone just sounds like an asshole to me
JK :)
[Bessi Bjarnason reading children's stories has always sounded very pleasant to me]
Yeah but that's someone who gets paid for his voice of course he sounds good
Holy shit
Nope, but two of our first ladies have been foreign born, a Palestinian Brit and a Canadian
Yes
In Iceland the 6th of January is called Þrettándinn (meaning the thirteenth) because it's the thirteenth, and the last, day of Christmas
We celebrate it slightly, for example most people shoot their last remaining fireworks up that night
In iceland it's known as Þrettándinn, the thirteenth, and it's the last day of Christmas
It's celebrated with fireworks and bonfires around the country
Never drive off-road
It damages the nature which has an extremely hard time recovering and you will be fined
Go off-road

How I envy you
We are way too tame
I'm hosting a hot-dog grill party tomorrow for my siblings, nieces and parents
No singing unfortunately, just a normal family eating grilled Icelandic pulsur in a bun with ketchup, mustard, fried onions and remúlaði.
I end up having to babysit the preschoolers in my family (trust me you dont want to babysit them) (siriusly there are like 6 of them like what
We get together in the countryside, eat good food, drink beer and sing songs all night when everyone's drunk
Far, får får får? Nei, får får ikke får, får får lamm
Dad, do sheep have sheep
No, sheep don't have sheep, sheep have lambs
Its Norwegian not Icelandic though
Icelandic
Valey á á á á.
Valey owns a sheep on the river
Á means: own, sheep, on and river
No idea why but we don't use á for sheep any longer, we use the word kind or lamb
One time we had a news story about all our sheep (Kindur) needed to be taken in because of a volcano and the German news changed it to all children (Kinder in German) needed to stay indoors because of the volcano
Let natural selection do its thing
it's a big church
**Hamar** \- it is pronounced with a hard R and sounds pretty badass to me
**Mjölnir** is also much more badass in Icelandic than in English, I honestly cringe when I hear it in the movies with both an incorrect Ö and an incorrect R.
The name Mjölnir means somebody who smashes stuff to smithereens (mylur=grinder) and is a very fitting name for a hammer
It smells way worse
Poo in open air smells A LOT more than submerged poo
Bloody interesting to an Icelander
Our weather is so unpredictable and constantly swings between warm&wet and coldn'dry so they wouldn't work for more than a couple of days

[Á Sprengisandi] is a good shout
It's about a man who is riding his horse over the barren, daunting highlands of Iceland and starts to worry about evil spirits, outlaws and elves as the sun starts to set
[Heyr himna smiður] is a hymn written in 1208 by Kolbeinn Tumason, a chieftain, on his deathbed after the [Battle of Víðines] You may have heard [this version of the hymn by Icelandic band Árstíðir] in a train station in Germany
[Sofðu unga ástin mín] a lullaby supposedly sung by Halla, the wife of the infamous 17th century outlaw Fjalla-Eyvindur, to their baby before throwing it into a waterfall so she could keep up with her husband while running away from the authorities
A more recent one is [Ég er kominn heim] It's more of your basic song about a man singing about how he will settle down with his loved one when he comes back home from his travels (presumably as a fisherman)
It's since gone to be the song [supportes of the Icelandic football team sing before and after games]
There's a town called Ísafjörður which means icefjörd meanwhile it's actually hell on Earth

It gets dark at 15:00 here (3pm)
I’m thinking something like [this] slightly melancholic yet soothing

salted licorice
Sounds like dugnaður in Icelandic, which means something  like “hard-working” or diligent
Ok, interesting
I was in Tarragona this summer, and saw smoking areas in restaurants and of course people smoke outside
It happened at least two times that we left a restaurant because of smoking, I get nauseous of the smell and can't eat at the same time
Almost everything is fucking closed at that time due to Covid
Bar would have been closed well before 11
45pm
So I would snack on something at home
Anything edible
Maybe order a Dominos, if they are still open
Normally they would be but nowadays
I don't even fucking bother to look it up
Shawarma, pizza or a submarine sandwich (not from Subway, okay sometimes from Subway) were my go-to's when I was at my drinking best
I ride a gravel bike in the summer and a electric mountain bike with wide studded tyres in the winter
Due to the hills and wind here, most commuters I see have road bikes or e-bikes
Regular hybrids are common in the summer
Recently those escooters are getting more and more common on the bike lanes
Relatively few people bike year round due to the weather, but that number is growing steadily
Those that do are a bit better equipped than the regular commuters in Europe, fancy light road bikes are common in summer and cyclocross bikes or hardtails with studded tyres in winter
Two
First period of freedom were the Settlement period (874-930) and Commonwealth period (930-1262)
Then the Norwegians and Danes ruled over us from 1262-1944
Then freedom came again with the independence from Denmark and the birth of the Republic of Iceland in 1944
We say Langtíburtistan, which litterally means far-away-istan
Langtíburtistan
Technically we do not have self-defense in Iceland
We only have a paragraph in our criminal code that allows for removal of sentence if you do something to prevent illegal attacks that have already started
The main provisions are:
You cannot use force that is more than the force use by the attack in question
You cannot cause more damage than the original attack would have caused, or cause more danger
Sometimes 1 and 2 can be ignored, if the person in question was so panicked that they couldn't really be faulted for going overboard
It's up to a judge to decide
This hasn't happened all that much tbh
Violent crime is kinda rare here
Well, Icelandic history is basically just "people arrive and settle, fish, some books are written, fish, 100 years of boredom, fish, civil war that noone actually cares about, fish, many hundred years of boredom with occational volcano outbursts, fish, plague, fish, poverty, fish, independence yay ". So we just spend one semester on Icelandic history
Reykjavík (Smoky bay) when the first settlers arrived on the island, they gave this place its name namely because of all the geothermal energy and geyser in the area
Probably settled there because it was a warm place to stay at
Reykjavík's name literally translates to Smoky Bay, named since when the first settlers arrived here they saw what they thought was smoke (actually steam from the geothermal areas nearby)
[Mýrarbolti] or mud football

The Nammibar in Hagkaup on Saturdays might feel a bit claustrophobic if you dont like being crowded by masses of hungry sugar craving kids and adults taking advantage of the 50% offer on all candy :D
But for real I can't think of anywhere (in the towns at least, Icelandic nature is a different beast) I would feel unsafe, Breiðholt in Reykjavík has a reputation for being the city ghetto but even there is pretty tame compared to anywhere in mainland Europe
Breiðholt looks and feels a bit more unsafe than other parts of the country but it's not really that dangerous
The crime rate over there is about the same as in other parts of the city
You're maybe more likely to get things taken from your car if you leave it unlocked or get your bicycle stolen in Breiðholt but that's about it
There's a higher rate of low income households and there are big apartment blocks with dark alleyways
Also a third of the people living in Breiðholt are immigrants so all these things combined have given it the reputation of a ghetto but people who live there and have grown up there have been actively trying to remove that stamp and the stigma around that part of the city
[Pic of how ghetto it can look by Icelandic standards lol]
[There are nicer parts as well]
> From your experience, which nationalities are most present among inmigrants in that area
I've never lived in Breiðholt but I'd imagine it's eastern Europeans (mostly Poles, Lithuanians and Latvians) and some Thai and Filipinos since those are among the biggest immigration groups over here
lol yeah that's a "ghetto"
You will probably laugh but, [Langspil] is our traditional instrument and it only has two strings

For Iceland it’s the blue lagoon, it way too expensive 40-60€ (sure you can spend the whole day there) but everything is expensive there like food and massage
You can have avocado toast for 20€ (I’m not kidding)
Also to avoid are the Puffin Shops in downtown Reykjavik and other tourist locations, e.g. Geysir
Everything is waaaaaay overpriced
You could get everything they are selling in these stores a lot cheaper at the Fleamarket (Kolaportið) in Reykjavík.
Edit: as u/Lilbed023 pointed out don’t buy the cans filled with “fresh Icelandic mountain air” in the tourist traps
it’s just empty cans
I think they are actually [on sale right now for 4€] haha
Yeah Exactly
And there are plenty of natural geothermal pools on the island that are safe to swim in
I think there might be a map somewhere on google with the pools locations :)
Oh How could have forgotten those blasted cans
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Cool, where you on some introduction trip or something else
Because they never give anything for free there
or did ya sneak in ;)
Hahaha that explains it, the blue lagoon was getting publicity

Compared to most of the other countries here, Iceland starts counting street level as the 1st floor (hæð) and the one one above that is 2nd floor etc
Anything below the first floor is the basement (kjallari), there's no "0" point
However if the basement is half underground (súð) then that might be considered the first floor instead of a basement and the first floor is a second floor
There are no rules here
We have the names but how people use them seems to differ a bit
In apartment buildings ground floor is generally marked as first floor
In spoken language both are used
It’s chaos
I was thinking more of like houses with multiple entrances where you walk down a few steps to go to one apartment and up some steps to get to the other, making no floor being on street level, giving it floor ambiguity

We have something called Verðtryggð lán (Indexed linked loans) basically most of our loans have about 3-7% so it can take up to 40 years maybe to pay for a housing loan

(I don’t like the IMF at least)

Here in Iceland it rises around 10:50 and goes down around 15:45
Our clock is an hour and half wrong, because people want more sun in the afternoon and to be closer to the European timezone
But at least you guys have a lot of sun in the summer like us

Iceland's history can be split like this (please someone correct me if I'm wrong)
Settled in 874
Commonwealth 930-1262
Union with Norway 1262-1397
Danish rule (This includes the Kalmar union and the Dano-Norwegian realm) 1397-1918
Kingdom of Iceland 1918-1944
Republic of Iceland 1944- present day
It was literally made 1000 years ago
874 AD, one of the very ancient countries still inhabited today
Probably 874, when when Ingólfur Arnarson settled here in near Reykjavík permanently
Yes of course
How silly of me
That wouldn't fall under Danish rule I guess but the Danish king was still the king of Iceland during that period so not fully freed from the Danes just yet ;)
Aw ok :(
Indeed
Independent with a Danish king and with Denmark representing Iceland in international matters which is why I said Iceland hadn't absolutely gotten rid of Danish influence just yet
Same here, called heimilisfræði.
Wouldn't like at all
You know, I wake up everyday thankful because we didn’t have Danish bibles
A small price to pay in the big picture
In Iceland it's called "Sumardagurinn fyrsti" or "First day of summer"
\- And it is a National Holiday
We have it on the first day of summer which is the Thursday after the 18th of April
We are really friendly to each other

I remember how blown my mind was as a kid when I played Age of Mythology with my friend and we heard spoken [Icelandic] There's also [this] awesome Taiwan tea commercial where the actors speak Icelandic
And there have been quite a few movies and TV-shows where some characters in the movie are supposed to speak Icelandic, usually it's been pretty random and bad
Incest and inbreeding
Historically it was frowned upon, family trees and relations have been documented quite well and compared to [other European nations] we’re apparently not inbred

[Skyr] yogurt
hmmm, I don't think so
What kind of gröt are you referring to
Can you provide links showing how it is made
It used to be considered a meal in itself but it is also used as dessert especially when mixed with berries, sugar and cream
No, it is a type of yogurt, it is not cooked or maid of grain
It is high-protein yogurt unique to Iceland
Not at all common in Iceland
As stories tell, some of our ancestors came from far away lands amongst the stars
They had a great ruler that had immense power gifted by the gods - he could control thunder and lightning, and throw things much bigger and heavier than himself
He ruled over many lands with a fierce hand
There was an uprising of the peoples in those lands and the ruler built a great weapon to quell the voices
They only grew louder so he used the weapon to destroy some of the lands with the most uprising
The peoples attacked the weapon but the ruler's forces were strong
A small boy was able to sneak through and with the gods favour was able to destroy the weapon from within
The ruler while still powerful no longer had the eye of the gods with his most strongest warlords turning against him saw his lands fall into turmoil
Many people fled on ships to find more peaceful shores
One such group of ships was in tranquil waters on a clear night, they were floating through the stars
When suddenly the water disturbed and the ships were swallowed by whirlpool of white that spat them out into the void of the deep
Those who survived found themselves on these shores with broken ground and stars in the sky they did not know
The name of the gods were banished so their gifts could no longer be bestowed and those who wanted to rule in turmoil were quickly dealt with
Not exactly hated but our primeminester, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, is in a left party but she started a government with a party which is more to the right

Iceland has a few
The most famous one is the Lögur worm (Lagarfljótsormur) which was caught on tape w more info here:
Then we have Nykur, a horse whose hoofs are on backwards
It comes from the ocean and if you get on back it will try to run with you back in
But the best (imo) legendary creatures are the Guardians of Iceland stemming from an old saga about a Norwegian magic who was commissioned by Harald king of Norway to scout Iceland for a possible invasion
The magic man supposedly turned himself into a seal and swam to Iceland where he was received by a plethora of 'vættir' or creatures with 4 main creatures guarding the country, one on each main side: In the South a berg-giant, in the West a huge bull, in the North a huge eagle and in the East a fire-spewing dragon
So the country is impenetrable and the king opted against invasion
These four main creatures are shown in the Icelandic coat of arms and are minted on the Icelandic króna coins

We got movies from Britain, the other nordics(mostly crime shows), French and even a few Italian, Croatian, polish and so on
These are generally aired on Sunday evenings or are shown on Scandinavian days or whatever
Pretty sure we have exported some of our shows as well, at least to Britain

closer to 8° in my opinion
Hnefatafl
It’s an assymetric abstract board game with one player playing as the white side with fewer pieces and a King piece, and the other side has the more plentiful black pieces
I don’t remember exact rules (the original rules are lost anyway) but it has something to do with surrounding units to kill them
It was played in the 4th to 12th century before regular old chess mostly replaced it
Fun fact, in Icelandic chess is either called Skák or Tafl, the first coming from persian “shah” (in english that’s chess and check) but the second word, Tafl, comes from Hnefatafl
And you don’t really ever ask someone “viltu skáka
” But rather “viltu tefla
”. Both meaning “do you want to play chess”. A chessboard can be either called Taflborð or Skákborð.
We only have one city and most people have heard of that one but maybe a good example for us is Reykjanesbær. It's where Keflavík airport is located (named after one of the municipalities that make up Reykjanesbær) and has a population of around 19 thousand making it the biggest town outside the greater Reykjavík area
Akureyri is a decent shout as well, it's probably better known than Reykjanesbær since it's a popular tourist destination (Tintin visits it in "The Shooting Star" as well) and it also has around 19 thousand people and is considered the capital of northern Iceland
Think there are plenty of way smaller towns though that many people know of, especially those who have travelled to Iceland like Húsavík, Seyðisfjörður and Vík but like I said I wouldn't expect the avarage person to know these places
Lund is well known in Iceland because a lot of Icelanders go there to study
Also because a famous character on a Icelandic comedy TV show had a fetish for Sweden and kept talking about Pelle Lundgren, his Swedish friend from Lund
I've heard of Rovinniemi
Bodo and Tromso are known if you follow football
Everyone in Iceland knows Gothenburg (or Gautaborg as we say) mainly because of the football team and because of the number of Icelanders who move there (this is the case for many Scandinavian cities)
Since we get a lot of football news from Sweden because of the Icelandic players who've played there through the years, I (and many Icelanders ) have heard of a lot of Swedish cities
From the top of my head:
Norrköping
Helsingborg
Kalmar
Östersund
Halmstad

Oh yes, here in Iceland they hunted all kinds of sea and land birds and ate, in addition to egg-picking
No carrion though,

I would call this missing the forest for the trees
There have been some developments, especially in the Icelandic vowel system in regards to the old long vowels and (at least "classical") Elfdalian has some interesting conservatisms (most notably the old quantity distinctions lost in every other Germanic language, including Icelandic, English and German) but compared to every other North Germanic language and dialect Icelandic conservatism in regard to grammar, vocabulary, general structure and in some cases even phonology is nothing short of striking, to the point where I'd call it hard to argue with a straight face that it is not as simple as as people make it out to be
Edit: for instance while Elfdalian verb conjugations and noun declensions are conservative relative to standard Swedish they are still much less so than Icelandic which preserves the Old Norse morphology almost perfectly
That could only have been political
Faroese and Danish split before the Faroes were even settled
>We're discussing pronounciation here
Are 'we'? :)
While Icelandic has like Faroese, Danish and Finland Swedish (and possibly other dialects
) lost the pitch accent I would seriously question whether that's a bigger pronunciation innovation than the continental palatalization, erosion of unstressed syllables and old vowel length mergers - although on that last point while preserving the old distinctions pretty faithfully the actual articulation of the old long vowels is famously eccentric in Icelandic
But again I dispute your premise that 'we' are only discussing pronunciation here
If you discuss anything but there is hardly anything to discuss because in essentially other way Icelandic is indisputably the most archaic North Germanic language, and only Faroese comes even close
Looking at the big picture I think it's as simple as people say it is
This discussion was linked from r/Iceland and so he likely didn't realize the title
This user is even more fascinating in that thread than here, although that's all in Icelandic
I went on a wild ride in that thread
It is the title of the thread but I'd argue that the discussion that started with the statement that Icelandic was the closest to Old Norse was broader
At least that's how I interpreted it
>I've only been discussing the sound of the language, at least
That was your first comment in the comment chain so I guess that's true by default
But starting from the comment about Icelandic's conservatism I don't think that was what was on everyone else's mind
>I don't know what you mean here
Yeah, I wasn't very clear, I meant the lack of distinction between historical long and short vowels
Elfdalian famously and uniquely keeps them distinguished by length to this day but most other dialects have merged *i* and *í*, *e* and *é*, *u* and *ú* and *ø* and *œ*. Icelandic of course isn't free from mergers, most notably derounding *y*/*ý*/ey to *i*/*í*/*ei* along with Faroese and merging *œ* with *æ*, *ø* with *ö* and *ǫ́* with *á* simplifying the 19 vowel system (of early "standard" Old Icelandic) to 13
But what I meant to contrast with was that many Scandinavian dialects have made the new post-quantity shift vowel lengths phonemic (with innovated quality distinctions thrown in for good measure) while these are strictly allophonic in Icelandic with the historical vowel lengths still being phonemically distinct in the form of new vowel qualities and diphthongs
>It's a big part of what defines the "sound" of the language
So are many other factors
Palatalization in particular has had a pretty profound impact on the sound of northern Scandinavian
It would be interesting to see which modern Norwegian speakers (say Oslo dialect or whatever) identified more with, no pitch+palatalization (Finland Swedish
) or pitch+no palatalization (Southeastern Jutlandic
) although realistically there are too many other variables to make a good test
Well, OP is
Then it just involved into a fascinating discussion on in what way each of the Nordic languages keep bits from Old Norse

Can someone fill me in on what's happening
This is the reason, I don't even l like any of it
But I need it anyway because that's where everyone else is
In many cases there's one person in each car
In my city (Reykjavík) it's almost the norm
The space required is kind of ludicrous
They involve faster movement to a point - the cars I see are stuck in traffic
Well I say "stuck in traffic", they *are* traffic
>so they stay in the public space for less time
That public space isn't recovered though is it
Roads can't be used when not in use by cars
They're roads, they don't suddenly switch to free roaming public spaces once no cars are on them
> They do sometimes, when people want that: for public gatherings, festivals, markets
That's a very limited amount of road space for a very limited amount of time
>know places that close for cars almost every weekend
When there are enough of those events in a place (usually the city center) that place tends to close the roads permanently
And those places are doubtless much better for it
City centre traffic is rarely fast moving and the roads take up too much space and cause related issues namely safety and pollution
I want to take my youngest in town and let her walk without fear of her walking in front of a car
I want to enjoy walking around without diesel fumes in the air
We have closed traffic in a large part of the city centre in Reykjavík seasonally and it's a far better experience
Parts are open for shop deliveries in the morning and that's it
Honestly, the weather's not that bad
There are many handful of winter/autumn storms and that's it
The main bus routes are every 10 minutes to every 15 minutes during peak times
The city and suburb towns are investing in a massive city line project to connect the suburban areas to the city centre with an express route
Traffic is becoming too much and we can't add more roads for two-car households

Alright so as an Icelander who now lives in Norway I always thought the amount of forest cover Norway had was ridiculous, long car rides blended together as there was nothing to see but trees compared to the varied landscapes of Iceland
But if Norway is only 39% I can't imagine 69& or 72%.
There are two things to consider
First is that we don't actually know how much of the country was covered by forests
The range is pretty huge, with the lowest estimates being around 8% and the highest at 40%. It is however clear that even at the lower end, significantly more of the country was covered in trees
"Human" activities (ie: mostly sheep) are probably the primary reason the forests disappeared
Other important factors are the "Little Ice Age", frequent volcanic eruptions, and the chopping of forest to make charcoal
The second, and to foreigners probably the more important one, is to remember what an Icelandic forest actually is/was
They were made of birch, not the massive evergreen trees you see in Scandinavia
[Look at this] for example
We have a joke in Iceland that goes "What do you do if you get lost in a forest in Iceland
" to which the answer is "You stand up". These birch trees can grow into proper "forests" but it is highly likely that just as today, a large portion of historic forests were mostly low-ish birch bushes
Most of the larger types of trees you see in Iceland today are imported species
The conservation and restoration of nature is important in Iceland, and within my lifetime I've seen great improvements

All these people here arguing wich political and economical system is the best, people dont realise that no matter what system you use now, its never going to work as well as it should have, you would have to fix the underlying world problems first such as poverty, healthcare and nature preservation as examples
I couldnt care less how many people died under what regime, nazis are responsible for 11 million, soviets 56-62 millions, Maoist 49-78, the imperial Japanese 6 million, the british 35 million, the french 4 million, the italians 1 million, the Usa 1 million, belgians 15 million, the spanish 8 million, its all a mess, but it is a fact that its history and the only thing we can do is be happy that it happened so we can not do it again and improve upon improvements
Btw just to clarify the death numbers are debated as all things are and thats not something i care to debate about, however if you want to debate with me about my opinion feel free to do so
There were about 5-6 million people killed in the camps and the rest is civillian deaths from german bombing and such, i did not include the deaths of combatants for the german or allied side, if that were the case that number would be (most likely) roughly 30-40 million, as all sources site differently
The 11 million number is real, and i did my research tyvm
The reason why i dont want to argue about such numbers is because all the sources are diffrent so you wont get anywhere witho  arguing about it
I had no interest in getting the non combatants deaths for the soviet union but famine and work camps were a large majority and you can reduce the number down too 36 million soviets if you dont want to include ww2 combatants
Secondly the main point of communisim is equal distrubution of wealth between people, not fixing poverty or healthcare
Such distrubution requires incredible ammount of mangagment effort and therefore communisim cant work untill in the future
Communisim also cant work with the precence of human leadership, as people and politics can never be trusted
How would i fix poverty you ask
For a start i would cut millitary budgets and build housing for people and give them enough subsidies just for necessities and create a goverment funded education, after graduation its their choise weather or not they stay poor
Capitalisim isint a single reason for poverty
And even if you managed to create a functioning communist society today, there would still be poverty
Why do you think i think that
Because i live in a utopian capitalist country with no millitary, almost no crime and poverty, with everything to fix poverty

Iceland is also a popular layover destination on the way to Europe
The Americans that travel tend to be nice, and as tourists they like to spend money
It's those that stay in their home state their entire life that are the problem
Icelandair offered a layover for up to seven days

It's just a ratio for doing trade

No reason why Brexit would force that
I live this far north in a different country, I cant understand heat like that this far north
And in the meantime we're having one of the, if not THE wettest summer since measurements started in 1918
I get what you're saying but given the conditions in Europe in general right now, this isn't just an odd summer, right
Yeah no doubt that's part of it, but the difference isn't THAT extreme
I think this is down to water insulation (I used to live in a land-locked part of the US and the weather extremes were insane)
Finland would be expected to get more of the Eurasian heat, but I'm mostly just shocked how hot it's getting there
Global warming is f*cking our sh
t up here too, mostly in the form of non-stop rain, warmer winters and colder summers
I am not looking forward to how this turns out, it's definitely accelerating and I think may be faster than the common scientific consensus allows for

i cant handle anything over ~25, i feel for you

all the rain is stopping in iceland and the faroes, I think Europe may be going the way of the sahara as the cool air shrinks towards the poles (Santa, not Stanislaus)
I lived in Köben a few years back and everyone said it was the best summer ever (i was dying in september, should have been 2013)
This is a huge difference

This phrase isn't used that much in Icelandic and when it is it could also be Greek instead of Hebrew
A much more common phrase for saying that a foreign language seems strange and incomprehensible, is *Hvaða hrognamál er þetta
* meaning "What kind of roe language is this
" (the word roe in English means fish eggs)
Hebreska
Er það eitthvað ofan á brauð?
I have never heard this in Icelandic
We sometimes say „þetta er myndletur” (or something similar IIRC) which translates to “these are Hieroglyphs to me”
I've never heard someone say Hebrew
Always chinese
I was about to just write "fish eggs" but then remembered that I'd seen a proper English word somewhere, which I found amusing not least because it's clearly a cognate to the Icelandic word and probably of Scandinavian origin in English
So I looked it up again to be sure
Any native speaker of Icelandic older than 12 would know what "hrogn" is however, if only because it's a traditional type of food liked by the older generation
Btw
It summer in that picture
Hallgrímskirkja = "Hallgrímur's church" or "Church of Hallgrímur"
So the title doesn't seem so stupid if you choose the second interpretation:
The Church of Hallgrímur church
In icelandic we would just say, "Hallgrímskirkjan", where the '-n' is equivalent to 'the', when talking about a church directly (the nominative case)
There are four cases in Icelandic, so you might actually use one of four words to refer to this church:
* "Hér er Hallgrímskirkjan" = Here is the church of Hallgrímur
* "Ég er að tala um Hallgrímskirkjuna" = I am talking about the church of Hallgrímur
* "Ég kem frá Hallgrímskirkjunni" = I came from the church of Hallgrímur
* "Ég for til Hallgrímskirjunnar" = I went to the church of Hallgrímur
When you combine these 4 cases with singular/plural and definite/indefinitive, you end up with [16 words for 'church']
This can get even more out of hand for adjectives ([green] and nouns ([to go]
This is such fucking bullshit
I'm living in Norway so I won't be affected it seems but it's the principle

Depends on how much effort you spend on land development
All that volcanic land that's full of holes covered in moss is unsuitable, but I have seen a few areas while traveling around that would be suited for settlement
There is a ton of land in the eastern coast that is fully inhabitable that just doesn't have habitation
The problem is that the demographics aren’t going to stay the same
The economy is going to take a massive hit
How is that surprising, that is very easy to eyeball on literally every map ever of Iceland
The vast majority of the country is uninhabitable, but not because of glaciers
No it really doesn't. A mountain range covered by snow looks nothing like a glacier
To clarify (because I'm being downvoted by people who have never seen glaciers
), this is the case on both maps (where glaciers are white and mountain ranges not) and in real life (they look very much different)
The only option is that you might be confused looking at satellite images taken when the country happens to be covered in snow
but that's not a map
No it won't man, that's just completely wrong
I have literally not seen a single map ever of Iceland that has mountain ranges covered by snow marked similarly to glaciers
Sure, but the process takes a very, very long time
Only the highest mountains in Iceland hold a glacier cap throughout summer
So these cap glaciers might look something like snow covered mountains, but they're only a tiny, tiny fraction of the total glacial area covered in Iceland
And even then, they really don't look like it in real life
You can quite easily tell the difference
The real glaciers look completely different

I got told off by my roommate and banned from doing dishes
Well I'd never ever even heard of the idea of conserving hot water
When my roommate saw me with the hot water on full right down the sink while I was scrubbing dishes he frantically told me to stop and asked me what I was doing
He then started going over a number of things and asking me why I wasn't doing them until he realized that I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about
And from then on I was banned from doing the washing up
Call back when its 33C you wimps
10° this morning and 8° this evening in Iceland
oh and it was snowing through all last week
Might be where the Viennese heat went, we expect 12°C all day today and I couldn't be happier
Light drizzle, cloudy sky and fresh wind - for the first time since I came here from Iceland I am not melting
And for the first time I am not walking around sweaty and miserable, I guess maybe that's why everyone I've met today has been smiling and super chatty all of a sudden
It must be true: If you yourself are happy, everyone around you can't help but become happy as well
Please, can it rain until the end of June
I prefer it at 10c, but I'm still comfortable at 15c, if I wear shorts and a shirt
20c is uncomfortable, 25c is really, really frustrating to deal with and 30c\+ makes me feel like I'm dying
I'm literally not sure if I'd survive 35c. What can you do when it's so incredibly hot
It's 20 degrees more than what I'm comfortable with
To me 15c is a nice day for shorts and a shirt

The EU's CFP, while better than what preceded it, remains a hot mess that would seriously undermine the economy of these countries

It's hard to argue to a population they should risk their economy for a potential fix somewhere in the future
It's been tried, unsuccessfully as of yet

The Ortsnamenbuch des Kantons Bern says the name comes from ‚lūter‘ „clear, bright“ (as in ‚unlauter‘ in standard German) and, indeed, ‚brunne‘ „spring“.
According to my family (from Untersteinberg, next door), the name comes from Liuterbrunnon, which means "clean water" or "clear spring" in Romantsch

I think the government in Iceland is doing the same
I’ll have to find the news article about it though
Can we get this in Iceland too please
For example, [The Blue Lagoon paid out over 12 billion isk in dividends between 2012-2019] yet they got aid from the govt for these "trying" times
If they were a truly respectable company, they would've kept a larger share of profits in the company to keep it running in case shit went south
For conversion comparison
12 billion isk is roughly equivalent to $82,7 million
Finally found it, it took a while (sorry I’m on my mobile)
[Companies asking for help ]
In short companies asking for help from the government are forbidden to pay out yields to themselves or invest in their own company afterwards

They even bought a house in Spain
It's very hard to know if that's because more people go untested through the disease or if the medical system is actually saving more people
I guess we will eventually find out with antibody tests
Even the death statistics can be very skewed so we can't really know other then to compare total deaths between months in years

People ski around in iceland
It's the highlands
It's uninhabitable, being volcanic plains, tundra, or really rough terrain
You need a 4x4 to get to most of it under the best of conditions, and most of those roads are closed over winter time anyway
Any town that would be built there would be completely dependent on all resources, and be virtually cut off from the rest of the country for 9 months a year
Its mainly mountains and tundra inland and is called hálendið or the high lands
Uhm excuuuse me, We don’t have Santa Claus, we have the [Yulelads]  which are way better than some stupid jolly lad
That circular road is the ringroad, and yes, most Icelandic towns are a hop, skip, and a jump away from it
Even the towns that aren't on or near route 1 (like Flúðir or the westfjord towns) have some connection to the route eventually
However the entire coastline and the lowland interior has towns
There are a good 60 municipalities in Iceland and some are made up of more than a single town/urban center
You cant even make 100 in iceland
There are fricking speed bumps literally every 400 meters
And the roads are shite
Source  I’m Icelandic
Edit: to add to this there are not that many straight chapters of road here on the island, always twists and turns that (I believe are made to slow us down :’D )
This hasn't been true for DECADES
Currently Looks like [this]
I dunno, we have nothing better to I guess
I’m guilty of that too
When I’m sure that there are no cops ahead
Ive mostly driven in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, compared to them the roads are shite
>  Back in 2014 I did a complete tour of the ring road, and it only contained a couple of kilometres of gravel
Those were paved in 2019
It's all paved now
well it used to be true so if you've talked to some older people who traveled Iceland that's what they would've seen
Probable where that comes from
There are plenty of gravel roads all over the country, it's just that the highway is all paved
Agreed, although I would remove the x from it
Don't worry, it will in September
Is that the same AAP that was pro-FGM for a short while until they caved under political pressure
For those interested here's a response to the AAP from a whole bunch of top-ranked European doctors writing in the journal Pediatrics: [Cultural Bias in the AAP’s 2012 Technical Report and Policy Statement on Male Circumcision]
Here's the Abstract:
>The American Academy of Pediatrics recently released its new Technical Report and Policy Statement on male circumcision, concluding that current evidence indicates that the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks
The technical report is based on the scrutiny of a large number of complex scientific articles
Therefore, while striving for objectivity, the conclusions drawn by the 8 task force members reflect what these individual physicians perceived as trustworthy evidence
Seen from the outside, cultural bias reflecting the normality of nontherapeutic male circumcision in the United States seems obvious, and the report’s conclusions are different from those reached by physicians in other parts of the Western world, including Europe, Canada, and Australia
In this commentary, a different view is presented by non–US-based physicians and representatives of general medical associations and societies for pediatrics, pediatric surgery, and pediatric urology in Northern Europe
To these authors, only 1 of the arguments put forward by the American Academy of Pediatrics has some theoretical relevance in relation to infant male circumcision; namely, the possible protection against urinary tract infections in infant boys, which can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss
The other claimed health benefits, including protection against HIV/AIDS, genital herpes, genital warts, and penile cancer, are questionable, weak, and likely to have little public health relevance in a Western context, and they do not represent compelling reasons for surgery before boys are old enough to decide for themselves
>...because the comparison doesn't hold up against the worst forms of FGM
But it holds up against some forms of FGM, right

>Jesus was born around 5 AD
You got a source for that
Hmm
I didn't even realize that there a consensus among scientists that Jesus was a real person
But then, if their sources are primarily the Bible then surely the assertion that Jesus was real struggles to move beyond that
>According to the Bible
Surely you cannot use the Bible as a reliable source when it comes to history
Can you give me an example of such sources
Then surely sentences like "Jesus was born around 5 A.D." don't work, right
They'd have to come with the warning "But that's sourced from the Bible, so you know

Iceland
I...I..I don't get it
TFW you only had Finland and Norway but never got Denmark and England like the Danes did because your King got shot in the head by his own guys
To imagine that Denmark would have so much land and oil if it just didn't lose Norway all those years ago
Heck, imagine if you guys still owned *England*.
They'll just come back with a particularly voracious appetite, having no idea why they're so famishes, but knowing exactly what needs to be done to fix it
Then we have Iceland, heating all our homes up with renewable energy, yet not getting a lick of this cold weather you mainland Europeans are dealing with right now
Not every country is lucky enough to sit on a ridiculous amount of untapped, easily accessible, renewable energy
So it's not really something we can be incredibly *proud* of, per se
It's just a no-brainer for us to exploit the natural resources we're sitting on
It's a lot harder for Poland to go full on renewable, but when you do, it will also be much more of an achievement
Yeah, -5 °C is actually quite cold for Reykjavik

"Hey, don't you guys believe in elves
For Iceland it's:

I know it's the way to annoy Icelanders
How about calling them the Arabic Nazis
Then follow it up with the Armenian genocide, Balkan stuff and calling Ataturk their Hitler
That should do it
'Hey, don't you have an incest prevention app
Even worse, a German guy once told me that "Icelanders believe in elves". I do not believe in elves
He tried to argue with me
Because you're just so *ligeglad* about everything
Iceland also left out
Presumably because Denmark was left out, and we would be nothing without Denmark
Which annoys us
There's a party dwarf who lives on a fjord up in the north
He's a drug addict, I think
That is too specific and strangely accurate to be annoying

I just took the test [here] Hopefully Iceland will be included next time, I suspect we'll score high

Atleast they are there :(
I really don't know, most people here are fluent in it so  we would probably score fairly high
You never annexed us, only occupied us
Otherwise we would probably not be free today, much harder to get freedom from annexation than occupation with promised freedom
Ah, makes sense, idk if the US would ever bother fully annexing us tho
If you fixed your healthcare and 2 party system situations I could maybe potentially (probably not tho) live with Iceland being a state

Nefnifall in Icelandic
Perhaps my English just sucks, but I've always used 'I' where I'd use 'ég' in Icelandic
I always use 'me' when I'd say 'mig' or 'mér' in Icelandic
[edit]
[Here] is an article on it
Yeah, I looked it up
They have entire articles on this
According to those articles if you go by strict grammar you say 'This is I'. That's how it used to be
But more and more people started saying 'This is me', to the point where it is much more common today
So it's just a case of the language changing in spite of the grammar
'This is I' is still grammatically correct, but in every day conversations, you're much more likely to hear 'This is me' these days
That's the only reason we're sort of forced to translate 'This is me' = "Þetta er ég". If their language hadn't changed in spite of the grammar, we'd be translating it as 'Þetta er mig' eða 'Þetta er mér', neither of which makes any sense in Icelandic
At least that's what I could gather after reading up on it a bit
[Edit]
Þetta er svona nokkurn veginn eins og þágufallssýki yrði allt í einu samþykkt sem málfræðilega rétt í íslensku

Ég high
Yeah, good point
i_irl has a pretty bad ring to it, doesn't it
I found some articles on it
It seems using 'This is I' is grammatically correct, but using 'This is me' has become so common in every day speech that it is essentially accepted as well
That's so strange to me
Feels like they're using akkusativ or dativ where it shouldn't be used
Wonder how it wound up becoming the norm in common speech
Looks a bit funny
Yes, that actually does make sense to me
Although I must admit, you guys really should start speaking our language
We have been doing our best to preserve it for you guys for a very long time now
I was reading some Jämtish texts this morning, from almost 1000 years ago
They're incredibly similar to Icelandic, so I suggest you start there
When you're done, give us a call and we can start making plans on how to take over Sweden and Denmark
We need to make Scandinavia red, white and blue
> "This is I", or "It is I", is definitely an archaic expression
I wouldn't know how archaic it is
I just looked up some articles on it
They just say 'This is I' and 'It is I' is grammatically correct, but enough people say 'This is me' now for it to be the most common form and as such accepted
It has nothing to do with grammar, as very strictly speaking it's wrong as far as grammar goes
But that's not how languages work
They change over time
But I'm Icelandic
When it comes to preserving our language we take things to the extreme
So we don't have any exceptions like this when it comes to cases (to my knowledge)
So this definitely came as a surprise to me
People speaking wrong grammar is stamped out wherever possible over here
But it's much harder in a country of over 300 million people
So English will always be a much more fluid language
But yeah, 'this is me' and 'this is I' both seem to be perfectly acceptable, although in every day speech you might get strange looks if you say 'this is I'. That's what I took from what I read

This is no laughing matter, the president has disenfranchised many Icelanders with this, and effectively split our society
Vegans, vegetarians and others who like many fruits and vegetables on their pizzas, (pineapple in particular) now have nowhere to turn and thus prepare for civil war
This war of the anti-pineapple  factions vs
pineapple lovers has left no room for moderates who may sometimes order pineapple on their pizzas but not all the time because it's ok but you can do without it
Here Is a follow up he just posted to his official Facebook page:
>Yfirlýsing í stóra pítsumálinu - a statement on the pizza-controversy :)
>Mér finnst ananas góður, bara ekki á pítsu
Ég get ekki sett lög sem banna fólki að setja ananas á pítsuna sína
Mér finnst gott að hafa ekki þau völd
Forsetar eiga ekki að hafa alræðisvald
Ég myndi ekki vilja gegna þessa embætti ef ég gæti sett lög sem bönnuðu það sem mér mislíkar
Ég myndi ekki vilja búa í þannig landi
Ég mæli með fiskmeti á pítsu
>I like pineapples, just not on pizza
I do not have the power to make laws which forbid people to put pineapples on their pizza
I am glad that I do not hold such power
Presidents should not have unlimited power
I would not want to hold this position if I could pass laws forbidding that which I don´t like
I would not want to live in such a country
For pizzas, I recommend seafood
He's joking, people have the legally protected right to ruin their pizza
I'm from Iceland and this guy just went from pretty good to not my president
Luckily his only power is signing bills or not, he's literally worse than Trump at this point
We're basically the same
Pítsa is best pizza
Yep, the president in Iceland is mostly a ceremonial role
His job is also to ensure that there is an active parliament
So He comes into play after elections or if the parliament majority breaks down
So when there is an active parliament majority running the show his job is mostly to shake hands and hold speaches
He also has the power to decline laws past by parliament in which case they will be sent to a public vote
It has only happened a couple of times in history and it would be an outrage if he did unless a significant part of the population were demanding it of him
It happened for example with the Icesave contracts where 20% of the population signed a petition urging him to decline
Why the fuck are they punishing the Welsh and North Irish
I guess celts aren't as brotherly as it seems
have you seen my boi [Sigmundur Davíð] (the second half of the video is in Icelandic but you should get the idea of what is going on)
BAH
I always fuck this up, this is the second time in like 2 weeks
yes, Sigmundur was the prime minister at the time and it caused a change of leadership within his party and almost killed the party in the following election
The reason I always fuck this up is that I'm a programmer and when you are accessing memory "things" with the index "item" then you do things[item] which is the opposite to the way it is on reddit

No, I'd say Iceland is pretty much good

The Barcelona one was not shooting with a gun, but a crossbow
It's a stretch to include that incident IMO, since the connotation of school-shootings are with a firearm, not bows
> The problem with school shootings is that someone brought a weapon into a school to murder kids/people
So not really a stretch
Yes, I'm sorry it is a stretch, because of the connotation of school shooting and the map legend makes no attempt at explaining the definition of it
You can shoot rubber bands as well, if you want to have a strict definition of the word "shoot", in which case there's school shootings every day in every single school, all over the world - including Europe
This is an example of shoddy research, the guy who made the map, google'd "school shooting" and didn't read the article

Yea it was really hot today
It’s too damn hot
Fuck summer
It was fucking 22 degrees the other day in Reykjavík
I’m not gonna lie, I’m one of those “I wish winter would be an all year event” kinda guys
Oh we’d forget it ourself if we weren’t standing in it, I got to wake up for a shift in 2 hours and 45 minutes, but no way in hell I can sleep it’s too damn hot outside
Right
We’re in the middle of nowhere to live in the cold, not middle of the bloody Italy
14°C during the day is kind of normal during summers
Our heat record was beat in my village a few years ago, 30°C most jobs sent workers home cause it was too hot
I’ve always said, anything over 5 is excessive
It’s amongst the fastest and cheapest in Europe
We're just piggybacking on the cables you guys have put over the ocean to America

I mean I don’t put on a coat until it reaches below -17 I guess you could say I find that cold
Icelandic weather is pretty consistent around the year (thank you gulf stream)
It generally swings between -5°C and 15°C under average conditions
26 in my home town tbh but only for like 2 hours then it started raining
The heat record of my town (Eskifjörður) is I think the country heat record which was 32°C if ur recall correctly and I remember I was 14 and had to work all day

Most people are impressed with my progress since I speak it every day, and I'm super enthusiastic about it
Other people simply open the conversation with English (which should never be the case in my opinion) and even when I speak back in Icelandic for the entire conversation they will maintain English

It's like they don't actually want me to speak it for some reason
Oh well, I will not be deterred

Or wealth has been given to the corrupted rich and moved abroad with full backing of the same party that's now doing nothing about Iceland's first case of corruption and exploitation in Africa
Not the same, but in Iceland the Danish rule has been generally regarded to have been tyrannical and Denmark is not portrayed particularly positively in Icelandic history classes
I'm very curious, do the Danish teach anything regarding Iceland
I'm mildly surprised to see Iceland mentioned here
The Danish rule over Iceland is generally regarded to have been tyrannical by Icelanders and the greater part of Icelandic history classes are devoted to this period
Icelander here
All four of my grandparents were born and raised in Iceland under the reign of a Danish monarch and both of my grandfathers were citizens of the Kingdom of Denmark by birth, as opposed to citizens of the semi-independent Kingdom of Iceland, like my grandmothers who were born a few years later

I have had some moments like that, but I have also experienced the opposite, where I thought a group next to me was speaking in Icelandic, but once I started listening I realized that I didn't understand a word and that they were, in fact, speaking Finnish
Ah, this is interesting
Icelandic and English are very similar languages grammar rules seen, so that this sentence sounds not to bad
Interesting thought, know not how different combination words is in Icelandic compared with English but well it worth to try

We pride ourselves is the quality of our tap water

Bottles he filled straight from the tap
Not in Ireland but I asked for a glass of water at bar in Manchester and I could not finish it because of the taste of chlorine
It's only the hot water that smells/tastes and only in the old part of town, where nearly all the hotels are located
We never drink the hot water and don't use it to brush with
The hot water smells in some places where we still use water directly from the ground, half of Reykjavik and it's neighboring towns have hot water that's heated cold water so that doesn't smell at all
The old part of town where nearly all the hotels are located have the old system, which is why nearly all tourists think our hot water smells
The cold water is very clear and mildly alkaline at pH8, in Reykjavík it's a mix of rainwater and lava-filtered groundwater

Off-road driving is illegal and people have been fined and made to fix what they ruined
The landscape is delicate and there's been a lot of work in the last few decades to grow the areas that are full of sand
When icelandic people talk about off-road driving it's not off-road driving, we follow paths that should be visible to just about anyone

To this day the only actually good Icelandic I've heard a non-Icelandic actor utter is a [Taiwanese advertisement for bottled tea] I mean, they have an accent, of course they have an accent, but the language is clear, concise, correct, and even if the tonal inflections are wrong they are wrong in the most adorable way
Jonah Hill takes the trophy for the [worst accent while still giving a decent amount of effort] It's not that he's doing a very bad job, it's just that he is having a really hard time with the phonology so he uses weird vowel choices and muddled speech
You can kind of understand him but it's still really hard
His co-actor in that scene however is, while stilted, quite understandable: so good job there
90% of other "Icelandic" I hear in films and TV shows might as well be Vonlenska, the made up language Sigurrós often sings in
Utterly incomprehensible, riddled with grammatical errors, or an english-speaking actor just saying Icelandic words using english phonology and stress patterns
Marvel was pretty bad at that to the point of not even trying
Non-Icelanders speaking Icelandic is so rare that I just feel flattered, even if their accent is strange
An example of this is from the danish tv series [Ørnen - en Krimi-Odyssé] at the 3:00 minute mark
His Icelandic is perfectly understandable, even though it sounds off

There was an interview some time ago with Jessica Biel about how her husband Justin Timberlake excels at everything he does
One newspaper decided to translate that story but something went awry during the translation so the article in Icelandic was about how good Justin Timberlake is at using the Office application Excel
The article was deleted but I found this [screenshot] The headline is: "Can't live without Excel-documents"
Right now it’s 11 degrees and raining
You guys have fun this summer
As usual Iceland is save from this recent ascend in temperature during European summers, it's currently 11 degrees Celsius and raining where I'm at
Doing just fine here in Iceland
Hot weather is not one of our many problems
Highest ever temperature was 30
5°C in 1939
20 degrees are not common in Reykjavík at least but it does happen but you'll have 20 degrees somewhere in Iceland every year
Most summers it's around 10-15, can go lower, can go higher
I'm fine lmao
Thanks
Hope you are doing ok as well

One more question for the educated man:
When are you benevolent Danes planing on returning the rest of the treasured Icelandic manuscripts you're still refusing to let go of
I can't understand him speaking, just one and one word but I can read the text and get a pretty good idea what's it's saying
First one was easy for me but the second was a little hard
Yet you returned the Codex Regius to Iceland in 1971, I wonder what your reasoning for that is
When the two countries parted ways in the 20th century, whatever Icelandic artifacts stored by our then mutual government should naturally have come under Icelandic ownership
Most of your countrymen know this and that is why you've already been persuaded to return two thirds of those "royal gifts". Just as the UK, you will eventually have no choice but to return your illegitimate and colonial artifacts
>You say they were colonial
No - read better
Besides, Árni Magnússon wasn't just any "local" but a professor of the University of Copenhagen, on the kings' payroll to carry out various tasks in Iceland
This is the context in which the manuscripts were collected, donated and lent to the collection
Any talk of gifts here is misguided
It was only natural that the Icelandic scholar, who collected the Icelandic manuscripts in the Icelandic, left his estate to our only existing university library
No doubt he intended the collection to be preserved by the state, *not* by the Danish nation
The fact that this gift-argument is the only one you have illustrates the situation well
I’m not exactly an expert of the different towns in Iceland but according to google it’s Þorlákshöfn

I had no idea it was weird until some foreign exchange students pointed it out
According to the gpi we’re the most peaceful country in the world
London
You start in a small gang with limited access to guns, but then you level up and get access to more advanced Weapons and locations
The game then ends in a mission stealing the Crown Jewel's.
Well yeah, but why not again
I mean you have to admit that it's pretty outdated
Gotta be careful of that Covid-19 whistle
I liked it
Also liked Schloss Neuschwanstein
And Dinkelsbühl
haha money printer go brrrrr
I visit Gamla Stan for the old houses tbh
Don't have many of those over here
I write it as 'a'. However it often tends to look like a 'z' due to the way I write
Too late, we're over
I just saw Svalbard the other day, hope you're enjoying your new slut
Of course, I hope the people of Belarus stay safe and force some positive changed
I know of It mostly from Reddit
Stay safe out there dude
I don't know what we can do over here but good luck
How over polite you guys are in service jobs
It doesn't come off as friendly it comes off as fake
An American called my job the other day and the minute I said hello he just bombarded me with words
"Hi my name is Kevin I'm calling from blabla how are you this afternoon
I didn't know how to respond to that because I'm not used to this type of conversations
Viðey island 5 minute boat-ride from Reykjavik, it's old monastery, tiny church and bird-sanctuary
And then of course pretty much the whole of the country is a hidden gem if you don't count the Golden Circle
The West and especially the West fjords receive the least amount of tourists
Stay out of the South if you want to avoid tourists
Kaka is cake in Icelandic and kúka (pronounced cooga) is to poop
The car Kia Kuga is a little funny in that way
Although we don't share a language I imagine we get *a lot* more news from Scandinavia about their internal affairs than they do of ours
Denmark or Norway I think
We have midges and they do bite
We have mýflugur but they are almost entirely in the north
> freezing temperatures and dark
Trust me, it wouldn't be the dark and cold that would break you in Iceland, it would be the goddamn wind
The other Scandinavian countries are generally colder but calmer
And I'm not necessarily talking about storms, like the few we have most winters, I'm talking about the *non-stop* wind, like every day, all year
My favorite days are the days where there is no wind
Wind makes everything worse
Hey I can answer that for you, some mosquitoes make it to Iceland with planes and tourists perhaps, but they never make it to lakes or something like that to lay their nasty eggs because of strong winds here
Es ist nicht so schlimm
Wenn ich kann deutsch lernen dann kannst du isländisch lernen
Cześć! Poles are the biggest minority group here
Around 20k I think
Split between poles who have settled here and started families, and Poles who simply come to work and then go back to Poland to buy a house etc
I attended school with many poles and have worked with a fair share
So I guess you could feel at home here
Some Poles I know struggle with Icelandic but others speak fluently or at least very well
I'm pretty sure Polish is more difficult but it of course depends
You as a native speaker of a slavic language might find it more difficult to learn than a native germanic speaker would, but don't let that discourage you
If you really want to make it happen do it
Summer is the best time in my opinion (if you can handle sleeping with 24hr daylight), spring can be very rainy
I totally agree
There are some Polish people who have no interest in and hate the country and its people
The most annoying thing about SOME Poles is when they speak no english and no icelandic
When I was working in any customer service job(f.e cashier at fast food or grocery stores) and trying to figure out what the hell these people were trying to order, them speaking polish to me and me speaking icelandic and english back
Really frustrating
But then again with every group of people they have every shade of grey
You'll find assholes, nice people and everything inbetween
I personally like Poles in general, and have gotten along really well with many Poles in my workplaces over the years
Spring is ideal for you then, but keep in mind
it'll be cold and rainy
but green
No there are more Poles they're about 4% of the population while Lithuanians are about 1,2% plus I have never met anyone from Lithuania in Iceland
Yup, you'll have a heck of a time, I'm sure
Not exactly the same kind of situation, but I remember a funny incident that happened to me and my friends when we were traveling in Amsterdam
We were sitting at one of those, ehm, delightful coffee shops they have, and suddenly we hear a loud American rambling about how “he doesn’t understand how people want to visit Iceland when they’re traveling to Europe
It’s so far away from everything, it must suck
” We all smiled at him and said “hey, we’re from Iceland
” His face was priceless
I actually think he felt super embarrassed about it because he started saying something like “yeah, I’ve heard you guys got some proper strongman there” (we are all pretty big dudes)
We thought it was super funny, I’m sure he was not expecting four Icelanders to be sitting next to him
We didn’t blame him, we do get bored of being so far away from everything
If he could learn Hungarian I think he deserves some money
I’m pretty sure he had seen [this] video
So do I, but every once in a while you get the urge to leave for somewhere else
I think it's a requirement in Iceland
I wouldnt consider it cold until it got below 5°c, though wind is a massive factor
Same for me, an Icelander
Anything above 14c is T-shirt weather (if the wind allows)
I’m currently wearing a thick jumper around outside now and the temp is going from ca -2/0c in the morning up to 10c
The worst here is December and the longest day then is only about 5 hours
Sunrise is around 11 am and sunset between 3 and 4 pm
Sounds kinda depressing but at least during the night you can see sometimes northern lights and because it's December a lot of places are lit up with Christmas lights giving nice atmosphere
Yeah, there's some social life of course but usually I just hang out with friends at their place or mine, don't go out much to any bars or something like that
And Stöðvarfjörður
Whoa how did you end up there, those villages are indeed kinda boring
Sounds nice
I'm just surprised a bit that they sent you to the place in the middle of nowhere but anyways I'm glad you enjoyed it
In Iceland big balls (stór eistu) would mean you had a medical problem or a saggy sack
How much did you win
Iceland has among the lowest smoking rates in Europe, around 9% of the nation smokes
It's a gateway drug to lung disease
The young people being admitted to the ICUs are vapers
I read somewhere that a chemical in some vape-fluid hinders the white-bloodcells in the lungs, thus more pneumonias amongst vapers
and now Covid deaths too
Here young people do it and it was/is considered cool but to be totally honest it is mostly a habit of people that work manual labor
"Columbus discovered America
Icelanders: NO HE DID NOT
When they say things like, but its because they have such á low headcount, their culture ís homogeneous, oh they are an isolated island whenever we manage to accomplish anything of note and people are dismissing It outright
Yes Í know maybe some of them have the occasional point bút it stíll annoys me to be só blatantly dismissed if we do anything good
That is the line that has been adapted here too
Same for us
They're all from Holland in Icelandic
I still don't know the difference, but I sure know how to pick a fight with a Dutch guy
Is there still a lot of communication and trade between Portugal and Brazil
I presume you guys understand each other more or less
or what
If horses leave they can’t come back the island
Why do you say that
No like leaving the country
Yeah the Icelandic horse the only horse that lives here
They are legally not allowed back to Iceland if they go to another country
There are some laws that say that horses can’t be brought to Iceland and Icelandic horses can’t be brought back
We have á few here in Iceland
There ís sprengjudagur(exploding day) where we eat salted meat and meat soup until we explode
There ís öskudagur(ashday) where lifa dress upp and sing fór companies
There ís bolludagur(no idea how to translates that) where kids attempted to spank other people with ceremonial apankers and got á sourdough ball with chocolate on top and whipped cream and jam in the middle fór each time they managed it
Though that is mostly just shortened to people eating said sourdough puffssourdough puffs
And whipped cream on It
Oh and there was the day when á foreign man arrived and conquered Iceland for á few weeks
We call It hundadagarnir
Though that isn't really celebrated
Hmm well i guess not letting black soldiers into the country during WW2 while the British were "protecting us" but like that's the worst thing I can think of so yeah
Nothing really compared to the bigger countries who have long histories of wars and conflicts with other countries but all I could think of was the Slaying of the Spaniards
Basially in the 17th century a Basque whaling ship sank off the coast of Iceland and one thing led to another and a local sherriff put out the order that all the whalers be slaughtered
Dozens of these poor shipwrecked whalers were massacred in brutal ways, tortured their genitals mutilated, eyes gouged out etc
The funny thing is is that the sherriff wrote it into the Icelandic laws that Basque people were to be killed with impunity
Also Turks for the Turkish Abductions (even though none of the abductors were from Turkey)
Those laws were only taken out of the lawbooks sometime in the last century I think
Every year a person is sacrificed to appease the volcano gods
They show themselves to remind us of their existence
Can you imagine how much worse it would have been without the sacrifice
In Icelandic:
(Sun) Sól / hún sólin (female) (Sunna is sometimes but rarely used, also female)
(Moon) Máni / hann máninn (male)
But the more commonly used word for the moon is Tungl / það tunglið (neuter)
The sun is feminine (sólin)
The moon is neutral (tunglið)
Fucking Anders Behring Breivik man
As an Icelander, I'd like to thank the Faroese for just being so darned awesome
They're definitely our favorite cousin out of all the nordics
I've never met an Icelander who dislikes the Faroese
Thank you USA
With the Marshall aid and your invasion in WW2 we would still be the poorest country in Europe
I second that
The Faroese have been there for us through thick and thin
Færeyingar eru nú meira en bara frændur
Mér þykir ótrúlega vænt um þá.
Jamms
Meira eins og litlu bræður okkar
While there May be some grumbling here and there we still very much look upon the danish ás our cousins and support them whenever they and not us are competing
Same with áll the nordics honestly
We are taught English and Danish as second and third language, then later on we can choose between German/French or Spanish
And I’ll have you know that we are 360k people thank you very much :D
First we belonged to the kingdom of Norway in 1262 and then came under Danish rule in 1814ish (and became a Sub-Colony as they liked to call us) and then is the history of the Klamath Union and all that
Hahah quite all right mein gut Freund
We generally love Norway here, look at them like a big brother
And Denmark
it’s complicated
Long story short It’s mostly water under the bridge though haha
Anarchy
Good golly sir
I’ll have you know that we were a [Commonwealth ]
Our allegiance was to the Republic, to Democracy
And thats What hurts the most
[being forgotten]
And Well you guys sometimes forget about the Faroes Islands too haha
[“This is the third time in five years, that the Danish public either flies the wrong flag or displays the flag on the wrong day
We still love you guys though, but as I said it’s complicated
They know who they are
Heyy, we’re just an island
At least you're remembered
Most likely Denmark
Yes
Thank you u/freecandyforkids69
Thanks for the nice thought haha
But yah we're tiny, can't evan think of a country that could be a wannaby rival
\#Very Finnish problems
There's also a nearby galaxy that is gonna collide with ours in about 4

Icelandic: Dýna (mattress) Danish: Dyne (duvet)
Icelandic: Sæng (duvet) Danish: Seng (bed)
Considering that bed and mattress are almost the same thing, it’s weird that these two things got swapped around
Seng in DK is bed
Sæng in Icelandic is duvet (down)
Dyne in DK is duvet
Dýna in Icelandic is mattress (matras in dk)
&#x200B;
Bonus- when offering the last coffee from the pot Icelanders ask:
Viltu börnin
Do you want the children
Translated from Danish: Vil du bøne(r)ne
I absolutely LOOOOVE living in Iceland
Our society is for the most part a well functioning one
The only thing that sucks is how short the summer is
Ireland has also been sending me vibes lately
I find it appalling how little interaction we Icelanders have with the Ire given that most of us have 40% of our dna from Ireland/Hebrides/Orkney/Shetlands .
I want to see where the princess/slave/free-woman Melkorka MyrKjartan's daughter was from, she's a major player in one of our most beloved sagas Laxdæla
before Covid there used to be, we had to import people from abroad to service all the tourists
Unemployment was under 5%.
Right now there is unemployment because of Covid but I'd say that when you see the unemployment numbers go below 8% you should be able to find something (depending on your resume of course)
We're a part of the EEA (EFTA) so we're members of Schengen and the internal market
It’s alright nobody has really tried to conquer us except Norway and Britain
There’s a lot of ocean and not much else
Sounds like Iceland most of the time  at least we save a bunch on sunscreenn
Perhaps it helps to keep in mind there is a place a bit further north of you where actual people live who have to suffer much darker winters
The howling January winds and the short days
Hahahaha yes I think maybe even 6 or 7 in the whole of Reykjavìk/capital area
In Icelandic:
Að tefla við páfann (To play chess with the pope)
Oh my yes, we have stories about trolls who could eat you or drive you mad, or just plain kill you, or occasionally sex you
You have stories about elves who could kidnap children and replace them with changelings, or drive people mad
And of course outlaw
It’s considered normal to get drunk on the weekends, nobody will blink an eye if you’re wasted out of your mind on Friday and Saturday night

Hunted into extinction, the last bird being caught in 1844
[Meanwhile in Iceland]
On an unrelated note: There are very few billboards in Iceland in general, and I don’t remember seeing any with a religious message
In any case, I’ve never witnessed this sort of “religious aggression” here
[Relevant comic by SatW]
“ Religion is a very private thing in the Nordic countries and not something you're supposed to tell others about, both because most people aren't religious so it would be considered rude, and also because they're such personal feelings for religious people
So a sure way to ruin the mood is to wear a T-shirt with a religious message, or any other object that somehow show what religion you belong to, most of all because Nordics will probably be too polite to talk about it (like I said, you're not supposed to talk about religion), so it will be a huge elephant in the room and they will just sit and stare awkwardly at you, afraid they might say something that'll hurt your religious feelings
The Faroese, it's very much like Icelandic but some of the words will have surprising meaning making for a lot of social gaffes and funny misunderstandings
Danish/Norwegian are also fairly easy to me, Swedish less so
Maybe færeska, and I don't know if it counts but we can still read ancient Icelandic texts without too much trouble
Am Icelandic
I understand almost everything when I read the Old norse language because it is what modern icelandic grammar is based on
I can read faroese and understand most of it but usually there are some words that are weird/different
I can also fairly understand written danish, norwegiand and swedish, like if I read a sentence I can understand like the gist of it
>  shit hits the fence
Do you mean "if shit hits the fan"?
Also, good bread is most definitely something I associate with Germany
Only thing I can remember is when I was sick from school one day and I was watching the channel that had the best daytime schedule (old school classics like Fresh Prince and Alf and Whose line is it anyway etc) and the broadcast was abruptly stopped because of a big fire in down town Reykjavík.
11 year old me was maaad
Never mind those Austrians in Copenhagen, you are rightfully referred to as mainland Iceland
side-eying in metric
Here's my list, only man-made:
* Colosseum (Rome, Italy)
* The Eiffel Tower  (Paris, France)
* Øresund Bridge (Between Sweden and Denmark)
* The walls of Dubrovnik (Dubrovnik, Croatia)
* The Large Hadron Collider (Geneva, Switzerland)
* The Channel Tunnel (Between France and The United Kingdom)
* Acropolis (Athens, Greece)
Iceland is lodging a complaint
We've got fjords *and* volcanoes *and* glaciers *and* black diamond beaches
Top that Norway
I don't know, I just find it amazing that humans built something that connects two nations by building a tunnel under the ocean for 50+ kilometers
It may not be as pretty as the Øresund Bridge, but I find it quite wonderful
Probably true, however the Colosseum is just so well known that it probably trumps the others, it's also amazing when you think how short a time it took to build
From an engineering perspective it is quite cool, one of the few places I've been to that really makes you appreciate the engineering of the classical era
It is also so well preserved that it merits the place imo
The eiffel isn't everyones thing, however it is one of the defining features of Paris, and probably one of the most famous landmarks in Europe
I agree that there are more beautiful items, even in Paris, but this one is on the list just because of how extremely influential it is
Have you been to Iceland lately
Global warming is treating us kind
I still don't know why people say that, we definitely have forests
haha trees don't even exist, might as well brag about having dragons if you wanna go all mythological
The Blue Lagoon is excess water from a nearby power plant
It's an accidentally man made thing made from runoff from a factory
not very glamorous when you say it like that
There are lagoons in Iceland far more beautiful that I would put on a list if we're searching for natural wonders
(Google "jökulsárlón site:reddit
com/r/mapporn" if you want examples of one such lagoon)
Gabon is 87% covered in forests so I guess Norway doesn't have forests
For Iceland it is
Norway
Denmark
United Kingdom
United States
And then no one really stands out for fifth place, it could be any one of these: Faroe Islands, Greenland, Ireland, Canada, Sweden, Russia, Germany, Poland, Turkey, Basque country
Norway
Denmark
Britain
Greenland
France
We are so young of a country that we don't really have much
Also in 1262 we fell under Norway and then later we fell under Denmark
In school we don't learn much about after we fell under Norway, so this is mostly before that
For Iceland I'd say
Denmark - in effect colonizers, enforced monopoly trade and crown rule
United Kingdom - business through the ages, WWII occupation, Cod wars
Norway - where most of us came from, shared culture
USA - 20th century influence, NATO, Navy base, tourism
France - fisheries and trade through the ages, until DK cut off trade under threat of corporal punishment
And weirdly **not** Ireland, despite 30% Irish/Scottish blood running through our veins
Since the slaves were captured and brought to Iceland in 800-1000 CE (and probably some Irish settlers being assimilated), there has been weirdly nonexistent relationship between those two relatively close neighboring countries
Why India
Do you mind putting the reasons behind each country so outsiders can understand why these relationships are important
That's only if you're counting recent times
In the middle ages there was so little contact with the Inuits of Greenland with either Denmark or Iceland
Icelandic trade funded much of the Copenhagen we see today
Typically the mayor of CPH was a part of the Icelandic monopoly trade which was enforced strictly so Icelanders were forced to do only business with their regional merchant who set the price and didn't pay out in money but store credit
This is a very dark time in our history that we feel Danes know very little about
It's like other colonies seeking recognition for the wealth that was moved to colonial Europe
Basque sailors frequently fished in Icelandic oceans
They sometimes talked to the locals of the Westfords in the [Basque-Icelandic Pidgin] And there was once a conflict between these groups that ended in a [massacre of the basque sailors, the last one in Iceland’s History]
You can see my other reply
It’s technically not Turkey, but a misnomer
[The Turkish Abductions] were naval raids on Iceland by pirates from the Mahgreb and Berber regions, mistakenly thought to be Turks from the Ottoman Empire
They took some people as slaves and some of those slaves eventually returned and wrote some books about it
This event is slightly important in Icelandic history, everyone is taught about it in Iceland, and even some Turks in Turkey are taught it
The French used to come here to fish
There was a hospital in the small fishing village of Fáskrúðsfjörður that has been made a museum and it was really interesting to go there
This is simply not true and is a fine example of colonizers turning history on its head
The Iceland trade was highly lucrative and merchants had to make bids to get them
The merchants got to set their own price and did not pay with money but 'store credit'.
This revisionist view of history is simply ridiculous
Let me correct you here, this is not just the work of Guðmundur Hálfdánarson but scholar after scholar that's done work on the subject including
It is utter nonsense that there was "nothing of value in Iceland" as you claim, **Iceland exported live sheep, Eider down (for the duvets of European royalty), massive amounts of pickled/salted herring, dried salted fish Skreið, massive amounts of shark liver oil that was considered the finest burning oil in European cities before the existence of gas lighting, eggs, smoked birds, seal hides and wool, in addition to guano and sulfur for the making of gun-powder
On top of that whaling was a lucrative industry that was mostly conducted by foreigners in Icelandic waters but whale blubber oil was also highly prized as lamp fuel that didn't smoke, just like the shark oil
There was not only taxation that was supposed to cover operations for the King's men in Iceland (the Danish overclass) but the profiteering was primarily done the monopoly merchants that sold Icelanders crap products while buying products at dirt-cheap prices, especially fish
Then we have the king claiming assets like when the king restricted or even banned Icelanders from going out to fish in their own waters because he considered the fish 'his fish'. Overfishing was of course not a problem at the time while over-whaling certainly was
Many of the richest people in Denmark were Iceland merchants and they got rich because of it
Copenhagen mayor Mikkel Wibe got insanely rich off of the Icelandic trade, Mads Hansen who built a mansion on Ströget funded by Icelandic trade, as were the houses of Nyhavn where a Danish Iceland merchant lived in every other building
Niels Örum and Jens Andreas Wulff furthermore made lucrative deals off of dirt-poor Icelandic backs and so on and so forth
Ther Östre Landsret building on Bredgade was in part financed by Iceland trade to name one of many buildings in Copenhagen specifically built off of the trade as is listed in Guðmundur Andri Thorson's stroll-books on Copenhagen
I could literally spend all day listing resources but most of them aren't available online
The main perk of this union was 'free' education for the few boys that could afford loding for year's stay at the University of Copenhagen, young men that would then serve as Iceland's priests, king's representatives or doctors
You've shown here this very real **Danish myth** that somehow Danes didn't benefit from entering into the union with Iceland which is demonstratively false and a way of whitewashing the atrocities that were committed in times of dire need, especially from the 1500's to 1786 when an eruption and following famine wiped out a good quarter of the nation and the monopoly trade became unenforceable due to famine
To give your past countrymen credit the citizens of Copenhagen sent barrels of rye following the 1783 eruption as well as the people of Trondheim in Norway
Add to these harsh conditions a very strict feudal system, enforced by the crown's men and rich farmers which meant people could not move/switch workplaces without permission and then only a couple of days a year
Because Iceland didn't have trees large enough to build ships it was forced to accept the mostly unilateral terms that the king set them, but contrary to popular myth before the monopoly trade there was quite a lot of trade with the English, French and Basque whalers that traversed Icelandic waters
But these ships of course did not accept passengers and due to a small population Icelanders needed to go abroad to study
I urge you to educate yourself beyond the basic Danish school books on the subject
The way Danes have portrayed themselves as the saviors of the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland is a myth at best and an attempt to whitewash cruel colonizing practices at worst

The Faroe Islands is Icelands little brother and only ally against all of you landcrabs
None, we are a lonely distant island floating around aimlessly in the Atlantic Ocean
I feel like the "our country-foreign countries" dichotomy is pretty big in Iceland, going to the "outlands" is a big deal and many people make a big deal out of travelling, you can't just drive to another country
If pressed I would probably have to say the Faroe Islands since they're in a slightly similar position
But they still feel like a distant cousin you see once a year instead of a brother
If you want an actual country then I'll say Norway
Fun fact, Icelanders are the only foreigners allowed to serve in the Norwegian army
Said someone
Looking forward to the very day it happens
Iceland has no standing army, and there is rarely any military propaganda in the media and many people are anti-war
So the number of Icelanders living in Iceland going to Norway to join their army is probably under a hundred peopld
My guess is that less than 10 people would join every year
Icelandic youth is just much more interested in getting an education and a high paying job
Personally I don’t know anyone in Iceland who has joined the Norwegian Army
That’s why I was so shocked to hear that my Half-Icelandic, Half-American nephew was joining the U.S. Air Force at only 19 years old

I would like to specially thank our BFF, the Faroe Islands
They've proven many times to be the best neighbours anyone could have
Poland (and the Faroe Islands) were the only nations to give us a loan after the devastating economic crisis in 2008, so I also thank them
There are also a lot of Poles here in Iceland who are great folks and have helped us building up our economy
Norway has helped a lot with regrowing trees in Iceland
Norway had an annual tradition for many years to give us a massive Christmas tree for the main square in Reykjavík. Nowadays we can chop down our own tree
The USA is obviously not part of Europe, but they helped us declaring independence and gave us a fantastic statue of [Leifur Eiríksson] (who was most certainly born in Iceland, looking at you Norway)
Færeyjar and Poland for their help in the economy crash in 2008

Rhotic:
*Djon meid his vei tú a tavörn þrú ðe dark forest ónlí tú fænd át ðat hí forgot ðe moní.*

My take on the Icelandic way
Djon meid hiss úei tú ei tavurn þrú ðe dark forest, ónlí tú fænd át ðat hí forgott ðe monní.
Well the two main universities are the University of Iceland (HÍ) and the University of Reykjavík (HR)
HÍ is public, around 470 euros for the year while HR is private and costs 1900 euros for the semester
HÍ is easier to get into (except for medicine) while HR is more strict
You can learn anything and everything at HÍ while HR is mostly computer science, engineering and law
Which one is more prestigious, I don't know You could argue HÍ because of the faculty of medicine, they tend to do whatever they want and are highly respected
Many view HR as very snobbish because of the tuition fee but honestly I think we judge the prestige of a person's education by where they studied abroad (e.g. Oxford, Harvard etc
etc)
Exactly this
I would say that rankings aren’t everything and people look too much into that
I for example went on Erasmus to Universität zu Köln and was not happy with the school, the way of teaching felt old and outdated additionally they were way to focused on their ranking above anything else

I think [Heyr himna smiður] might be one of them - this video of this indie band singing it in a German train station got around

The poem itself was written by Kolbeinn Tumason in the autumn of 1208 the eve before battle
It is the oldest known psalm in northern Europe

We don't have mcdonalds, but when we did rúv (bacicly BBC of Iceland) did an april fools joke that a curch was supposed to be redesigned because it looked too similar to the mcdonalds logo

Do you say ristavél or brauðrist
Both mean toaster but ristavél is "toasting machine" while the other is "breadtoaster".
I don't care what word people use but I've seen some heated arguments over this
Also "pylsa" or "pulsa". It means hot dog and "pylsa" is the correct spelling but a lot of people pronounce it as "pulsa" angering the other side that pronounce it like it's written
In Iceland its what you call a hot dog
Pylsa or pulsa

Can't really think of anything right now other than there is this unspoken understanding that you have to learn a foreign language
Because if you don't you're pretty much stuck at home since nobody's going to speak Icelandic abroad
It is sort of an obligation, some large coutries don't deal with this as they are larger and offer stuff right at home small countries don't have
Also foreigners tend to view us like some exotic animal that creeps me a little bit
Man, I really want to give my two cents but can't think of anything

I mean
the world *did* hear about The Great Icelandic Banking Empire
Doesn't exist
Bullshit the internet shared
We do have however a website were we can look up our family tree and relations but it's not for dating usage
You know whom you are related too
Yeah, and IIRC the Danish government actually sends us money every year because we have that in our curriculum
Don't ask me for a source, though
Danish is spoken by a pretty decent minority of people, probably mostly by people who have lived there at some point in their lives
Could be 10% or something, I've never seen any stats on it
To add to what Veeron said, it depends on the generation
The older the generation the better they are at Danish but worse at English and the other way round for the younger
So my generation overall isn't good at Danish
The people that stand out usually moved there/studied so they don't count
For me personally (25F) I can understand a little bit as long as it's something simple and spoken slowly, then I can get a context
But even then, accents determine how much I understand
This also applies for Norwegian and Swedish
We don't have a military, there is no Icelandic army
Nato does however have a base here that's mainly run by the nordic militaries and italian pilots
I personally don't have a strong opinion, I don't mind them having a base
I just don't want it only run by americans
If if were my countryman he'd have asked the elephant "s0

Very similar but not quite the same
One example is when the city of Reykjavík decided to turn an old army barrack/nissen hut into a restaurant/café. Original estimates said it would cost the taxpayer arond 158 million ISK but it turned out to cost over 400 million and that includes purchasing decorative, designer straws from Denmark for 750k ISK
The type of straw that was bought grow in the wild in Iceland btw
Not as bad as many other examples in this thread but it was all a bit farcical but it worked out in the end and it has opened, marketed towards tourists with overpriced burgers and the like
Ljósmóðir=midwife
Made up of
Ljós=light(as in brightness)
Móðir=mother
It doesn't sound perhaps as beautiful in English when you translate it but it's one of the best words in Icelandic in my opinion
Eve online probably
There may be one or two other indices but that is the biggest one
And we ask relatives to buy us cheaper alcohol from the airport :)
It’s definitely Appelsín here in Iceland
An orange soda similar to Fanta but better
Also it’s a christmas holiday tradition to mix together Appelsín and Malt (maltextract) for a festive drink
Malt is non-alcoholic sweet malt drink
We have several
Mix is a pineapple tasting fizzy drink that is somewhat like a less sugary mountain dew
Malt was originally a stomach medicine but was later turned into a soda
It takes some getting used too
Appelsìn is an orange-flavored soda that was originally created for the u.s troops stationed here during the war(or so the story goes) and due to war shortages couldn't get any soda from home
Appelsín, its a simple orange soda but its definitely fairly popular
.Also maltextrakt which isn't exactly a soda but is kinda similar to one, its somewhat similar to kvass and you can mix it with appelsín for a classic christmas drink
We have similar here in Iceland [Egilsmalt og Aðplesín]
Its a Christmas drink
mmm, my favorite drink in the world is this organic Danish ginger drink and now I'm dying to try the Italian Ginger
To trade I can only offer you the Icelandic Appelsín, a rather refreshing orange pop made of concentrate
I have never tried it to be honest
We have about as many "notable" voice actors as all of the voice actors in skyrim
I like ice cold whole milk, but I don’t drink it too often
I eat a lot of skyr though
Timbuktu was often used in Donald Duck comics
I’ve also heard people saying “Langtíburtistan” which means “Far-away-stan” (mocking the country names in Central Asia)
Usually we’ll say something is “úti í rassgati”, somewhere “out in an asshole”.
"Úti í rassgati" OR "out in an asshole".
We also call cute little babys "little assholes"
[This video explains it pretty well
Tilbúin eða ekki hér kem ég
Hey, we have the same 'problem' here in Iceland
Reykjavik is nearly 2 times off it's natural schedule, but instead of starting things later we force ourselves to wake up at ungodly hours
I presume it doesn't matter so much because our daylight is constantly changing, most of the year we're either losing or gaining minutes of sunlight
I think TippX is the only one we have
until we started Googling
This one was confusing for me as an immigrant in the Netherlands when buying a baby stroller
The salesman kept saying how you could attach a Maxi-Cosi to the various strollers he was showing
This seemed so oddly specific, and not very handy, so eventually I had to ask: Does that mean that if we buy a car seat from a different brand, we can't attach it
Hmm yeah kinda
Dragon is dreki while a kite is flugdreki which means "flying dragon" - then you got tank which is skriðdreki and translates to "crawling dragon". We also refer to the Hippocampus in the brain as dreki
Yes
Dragon = Dreki
Kite = Flugdreki (flight-dragon)
Driving outside the road in the nature
it seriously damages it, and causes a big fine up to 1000 $
i live in Iceland and this is sadly a common thing amongst instagrammers and other crackheads
Driving off the fucking road and trespassing
it's most commonly referred to a as Landsbyggðin
Not derogatory
We (Iceland) have “Landsbyggðin” which just translates to land settlement
It isnt a derogatory term but it can be used in addition to another word to add that insulting factor
Oh I heard this great story second hand about a rather famous gay PoliSci professor and his former Mr
Iceland boyfriend who entered a subway cart in Tokyo early (late
) Saturday morning after a long night of techno clubbing
Friend of a friend worked as a programmer at a Tokyo company and was reluctantly on his way in for work this early morning to finish up some project
Enter the odd-couple on their way back from the club, engaging in heavy petting and pda with graphic descriptions in Icelandic about what was going to take place once they got back to the hotel
This friend of a friend stayed silent and pretended he didn't recognize them, but as he exited the cart he turned to them and said in Icelandic "Have fun guys" (Skemmtið ykkur vel strákar)
He said they turned instantly mute and pale
According to the flight logs we go on average twice a year abroad and at least one of those trips is taken to another European country
A lot of people go abroad to study and we do a lot of business with Europe so there's a firm connection there
Icelandic: Kalkúnn
I feel like a damn pioneer
Trail-blazer of sorts
It took 25 years but nowadays I'd say young people from the age of 18-22 would start going it in parties and nobody would think it was a big deal
There is a lively stoner culture here and the local weed is potent
All those green houses being put to good use
Still the cops monitor electric use and fly over with thermal cameras to detect farms
More and more people are willing to decriminalise weed, mostly thanks to the local Pirate party and hemp-orgainzations
I don't want to be snooty here (yes, shhhh, I secretly do) but is it generally the lower classes that start adapting those baby names
I remember some 20-30 years ago when every other kid in certain groups was named Aaron, which is not just a very foreign spelling to the Icelandic language it's also a weird new Biblical reference in a dominantly secular group
I doubt many of the parents even knew where the name came from
His mamma got him in, her line is where the name came from
I fled Iceland after the crash of '08  for a few years, have returned now
Iceland is pretty awesome imo, despite the weather
Shout out to my ancestors for barely surviving on this hostile rock until modern technology made us prosperous
We went to Denmark, it was overall pretty nice but we weren't exactly welcomed considering Icelandic venture-vikings had just had a few big bankruptcies there too
Copenhagen is lovely 9 months a year, December to February it was terribly cold, the kind of cold that bites you to the bone
you're right, modernity arrived when we were occupied by the allies in WWII
Before that industrialization was very slow and pretty much limited to trawlers and Reykjavík.
In a century Iceland has gone from being one of the poorest countries on Earth to one of the richest countries on Earth
My grandfather wrote his memoirs and it describes poverty on an imaginable scale
I feel so grateful for my ancestors for hanging in there so I can sit here in my warm bed with a full fridge and still order pizza
Probably the highlands maybe some beaches outside of Reykjavík
Not a big deal unless maybe by some people if that person would have a non-Western last name or anything-other-than-white skin color, although that's something that would more likely trigger people outside of Iceland
Faeroe Islands, I guess
They got our backs in the credit crunch, although they are even smaller than us
Also speak the closest related language
Recently also Poland has proven to be a good ally
They make the best chocolate (Prins Polo) and also tried to help us when the Scandinavians didn't want to
Denmark and the other nordic countries in general
We're even though Danish in school
Edit: grammar
Oh, is that why Iceland's population is like 15% Polish
They tried to lend us some money, even though they had very little themselves
It wasn't the effectiveness of the help that matters, but the solodarity
Although I doubt most people from Poland ever think about Iceland or know much about us
It’s incredibly stupid and absurdist
Sometimes it’s self-deprecating but other times it’s making fun of our massive egos
It’s often also dark and dead-pan
Google 'can I ask you about wintris' if you dont know about it already
God that was embarrassing
That we are the best country in the world
Not particularly only if it affects Iceland, otherwise I could careless
However American politics is a mess and I am here for it
I would probably say in the highlands in the dead of winter during a storm
We would just say *gott og vel* which literally means *good and well*. It is really the tone which indicates how much or little you agree
First name - Middle name - Your father's name + son
We don’t believe in Santa Claus
We have the [Thirteen Yule Lads]
They bring small gifts to the kids from 12th - 24th of December
And they live in the highlands with their mom Grýla and dad Leppalúði
They live with their mother in a cave on the highlands
Check out [their cat

Haha I love Krampus, and I have for the past three years watched [this movie] around Christmas
I’ve always felt like Gryla and Krampus are similar-ish
I mean they both scare and eat kids
Yes and no, he is not as evil today as he was, we can't be scarring all the children now days
Also most children get some clothes before Christmas so they are safe from the cat just in case
We still teach children about it, but it’s done in a more humane way than when I was a kid
Here’s a [picture] of him in downtown Reykjavík and here is an eerie [song] about the cat (sung by Björk)
I find that hilarious when I imagine it
Yes, they teach religion around age 10
They teach all religions equally including Greek and Norse Mythology
Iceland is really weird because the Capital Area has 2/3rds of the Icelandic population (Reykjavík is half and the other surrounding towns has the other half) so if we would go with a population focused move it would be Akureyri, which is in the north of the country and is the largest town that isn’t in the capital area
Another idea might be to move the Capital to Álftanes, since the eternal home of the president is there, called Bessastaðir
That’s still in the Capital Area but just a bit farther from most of it since it’s on a weird peninsula
Also the town Álftanes doesn’t really exist anymore because they merged with the neighbouring town Garðabær, so it’s kind of weird
You could also come from the historical angle
Alþingi is the oldest continuous running parliament in the world (with a slight pause mind you) and before it moved to Reykjavík like everyone from the countryside did, for the longest time it was held at Þingvellir, you could move the capital there
Well the problem is that almost nobody lives there, it’s just a few houses and cottages scattered about and it’s mostly a open rocky place and a tourist attraction
But the historical angle isn’t really telling because before 1700 almost no place in Iceland had more than 500 people, the population was so incredibly scattered around so the idea of a capital was laughable
Maybe we should put it in Keflavík where the international airport is, but maybe let’s not since that place is a wretched hive of scum and villainy
We could put them on the largest and most populous island Iceland has, Vestmannaeyjar, and then just forget about it
We could put it in Selfoss, or maybe Hveragerði, honestly I always forget which one’s which
Probably Akureyri which ís á lovely town that sells hot dogs with exotic ingredients on them
It's also the largest town apart from the capital area
It ís fairly small mind, only 20000+ people instead of Reykjavíks 160000+(adjacent towns included), but at least we would be free of áll the politician
Or Kópavogur, because it is the center town in the capital area
A random british adventurer landed in 1809 confisicated  the country from danmark for a few weeks with all of a single cannon before being chased off by a passing danish ship
We celebrate the 24th as the night with presents and good dinner
Christmas starts at 18:00
We have a troll woman called Grýla who boils and eats naughty children
Leppalúði is her husband who also eats children
Jólakötturinn is a cat who eats people who don't get new clothes at Christmas
We also have 13 yule lads who do mischievous things such as stealing meat, skyr, sheep, candles, slamming doors, sniffing doors, peeping windows, licking bowls & spoons etc
This reminds me of a slogan the city of Reykjavík came up with when closing down streets to make them pedestrian only during summer months

I keep stopping tourists from buying bottled water here in Iceland
A couple of years ago there was a huge scandal here in Iceland where the owner of a small 'gay hotel' had signs up saying that drinking tap-water was unsafe but they conveniently had 'safe' bottles for sale at the hotel instead
Bottles that the owner had filled up himself straight from the tap
One of the main reasons his hotel was a 'gay hotel' was that he had read that gay guys had more disposable income and would pay more to stay at a 'gay hotel' so he marketed it as such
The other reason was that he didn't want to deal with kids staying for free in their parent's rooms
Duisburg is the first I've never heard of
Crazy its still bigger than my entire country despite that
Learn the double L
Yep I could pronounce anything word I see for example eyjafjallajökull is a pretty simple word for icelanders
Absolutely, we have emphasis on letters so you hear them
Eyjafjallajökull (pronounced correctly) is an example, you hear the emphasis and pronounciation and you write according to that
For the most part, yes
Although recently because of the current pandemic the word "sóttkví/quarantine" has often come up and I frequently misspelled that as sótthví in the beginning
Yep islandmountainglacier translated to English
I think it just reffers to Iceland it self because anything else just wouldn't make sense to me
I don't think so but maybe
No eyja is a single eyja the plural is eyjar
But ey is also a single island
I guess so
I didn't know that ey came from old Norse

The most dangerous animal
We don't have any big predators here, the largest possibly being the fox
Maybe the sheep since they sometimes cause accidents when they cross roads
Generally the wildelife ís the least dangerous part of Iceland
101 Reykjavík for Iceland imo, the movie that jumpstarted Baltasar Kormákur's career

Well here I go
Darkness so much darkness, (today the sun rises at 10:30 and sets 15:52) lovely
Expensive
So fucking unbelievably expensive
I believe that we are the most expensive county in Europe and we only have a population of 360
000 people
The currency is unbelievably unstable it goes up and down up and down like in a rollercoaster
Like if you think negatively about the Krona it goes down
Banks are awful, by I mean loans are disgusting here and by that I mean I can take you forever to pay off a loan (40-50 years for a house/mortgage) or for car (10 years or if you sell your car + loan)
We have something called “price index loansl” “index linked loans” and I think these types of loans are illegal according to EU because they are too confusing for the regular average joe to understand
(Somebody please corrode if I’m wrong here)
And similar like one Finnish dude said here somewhere, few families seem to own everything, they own the fish in the sea, own the super markets, oil service stations, real estate, and other huge companies etc and sometime seem like they are playing their own version of monopoly
So yeah these are the cons I can think of, there are some pros too of course
Yes, mostly though cronyism, nepotism and political corruption (but that’s perhaps not that much compared to other countries)
I myself have used clientelism to get a job, otherwise I would not have gotten the said job at that time
I prefer though to get a job on my own values
Hahaha Thank You
[My favourite Icelandic Disney song ]
Because of the loaning system we have due to the instability of the Icelandic króna, indexed loans and non-indexed loans
[about financial indexation ]
[all loans in Iceland  and interest rates ]
Sorry this is in Icelandic, but I think you can read out of this about how high loans are here
[Here you can apply for a loan at Arion bank and see the loans and rates]
You can pay up to maximum of 40 years but that really depends if not another travesty happens to our financial system, and if you want to pay for 30 years or less then you have to have higher wages and pay more of course
[price of property in Iceland ]

Hahah I would say pretty accurate from my experience at least, plus every time I went to Greece, the garbagemen went on strike
so also some garbage smell on a hot day

My family owns a house in an old village where people have been living for hundreds of years
It's almost a complete ghost village now although there are a few dozen people still living there, and it's very much out of way as the ring road doesn't lie through it so no one enters unless they have business there
It's very comfy
Yes
The medicinal properties are great and CBD really is a phenomenal substance
CBD can be a perfect replacement to many legal and otherwise harmful drugs and treatments
I'm not too fond of THC as it is psychoactive (CBD however is anti-psychotic) and can in many cases make users very psychologically dependent (speaking from my own experience and people I know)
But nonetheless for recreational use I think it should be legal and regulated like alcohol
Personally I think all drugs should be legal and regulated, or in the very least be decriminalized with a huge focus on harm reduction and pure substances
Addicts need help to recover, not punishment
Also it doesn't matter if drugs are illegal or not, people who want them will always seek them out, where there's demand, there's supply
I loathe the people who are selling, shipping and manufacturing drugs in the criminal underworld
Most of them are just ice cold brutes
With legalization you take away their biggest playing field, and people have a safer alternative in a legal and regulated market
And just for the record I'll gladly discourage anybody from alcohol and drug use
I'm an inactive addict myself and I've gotten a taste of how bad life is living with addiction
But that still doesn't mean I think prohibition is the right path
I doubt full legalization could ever be a thing but at least decriminalization
We are not even a part of EU
Sorry to hear you where disappointed
Á can mean river, sheep, "own" and "on" in icelandic
And a farm can be named Á (river)
Which means "Á á á á á á Á" is a grammatically correct sentence
Ó and Á, they are expressions of surprise and pain respectively
I mean "Á á á, á á á á" is a grammatically correct sentence here meaning: Ew, which is grazing owns an ew on the farm River
That's the thing, the only party that benefits from this system is the one that doesn't want to pay more to people
It's like they say was the case in old Rome when they thought about identifying slaves in some way, that if the slaves realized how many they were they'd revolt
I remember once when I had the salary talk with the only other person in the company in a similar position
She was taking on slightly more responsibilities than me
so she turned around and asked for a little bit less than me
Infuriating that she wouldn't try to pull us both up but settled for less, keeping us both down
I'm with you
We Icelanders are fairly open about these things but there has to be 'a moment' to ask
Our salaries are officially open (during a small time window) and then top-earners by area and industry are published so we try to keep the rich a little less crooked with transparency
This way we know what businesses/industries can afford to pay high salaries which gives young people information about where to seek a career and where we might be able to go into business ourselves
Plus too much income inequality has been proven bad for societies and transparency helps make sure the rich can't pretend they can't afford to pay taxes
I believe we have to apply for access during tax-return-season (first week of August) and then we get an assigned time slot where we have to physically go down to the Tax/Skattur offices and then we can only view the last years returns
There is only a small time-window when the tax-log is presented but I'm not sure if they've denied anyone entry yet due to time restrictions but I wouldn't put it past them
The right-wing governments of past have done a great job curbing our right to this information
Most people wouldn't get any of this info if the magazine Frjáls verslun didn't publish it every year
I try to buy and save a copy for future reference
psst, get yourself a fair
See instructions on the right
I'm not sure whether we fall under it or not, but since we have both a Prime Minister and an elected President that has to sign all law I'll answer on behalf of Iceland
In theory it was supposed to create checks and balances, in reality the role of President is almost purely ceremonial and cultural so the system does not work as intended
Because of tradition our presidents have rarely postponed or denied to sign a law and thus referring it to the Icelandic nation for a national referendum
It has happened all of one time when Ólafur Ragnar (1996-2016) refused to sign "The Media Law", but instead of a referendum the PM's government pulled the law and started working on a new one
Before that Vigdis Finnbogadottir (world's first female prez) wanted to postpone signing a law that would force stewardesses back to work when they were on a strike
The government passed this law on "Women's day" when the whole female population went on strike and Vigdis didn't want to sign the law until the day after, because she could see the symbolism
Patriarchy did not take that sitting down and threatened to turn in the coalition government's mandate
So instead of calling their bluff Vigdis caved in
A lot of women have never forgiven her for that
I presume they expected this kind of BS from men at the time
So overall the role of President is mostly meh
yes, at least everywhere I've lived in the Nordics
Maybe there are exceptions in some areas
Not sure about Sweden though, anyone know if the hype real about how unsafe Malmö and parts of Stockholm are
If you want to combine these two categories together then I think the most fitting country is Iceland
We consume less alcohol than most other European countries due to incredibly high alcohol taxes and a state-run monopoly on alcohol, probably the most expensive alcohol in the whole world
And we're also incredibly secular
I think a study recently showed that basically no one under 25 believes that god created the world
Church attendance is minimal
Political matters are almost never religious
Only reason why so many people are still a part of the state church is because it's automatically registered and people don't bother changing it
I’m trying to wrap my head around that statement
If we are the most sober nation in Europe, then something is wrong with this continent
Some youngsters buy Landi (Icelandic moonshine) from shady people
Funnily enough I have two friends that have gotten into brewing and fermenting their own beer and wines
But I don’t know if it’s that common
We can read texts from 1000 years ago rather easily
We read the old sagas in unaltered form in school
There are some old words, but we understand them easily
I once saw a YouTube video by a Norwegian linguist, where there was a conversation between two people in what they reckoned was in old norse
Every person I showed it to took about 10 seconds to "align" their brain, and could after that follow the conversation
The Icelandic language seems to have stagnated while the rest of the north evolved, possibly due to influences from german
Icelanders have a lot more trouble following norwegian, sweedish and (god forbid) danish than old norse
As an icelander I can pretty much confirm this
We can read texts from 1000 years ago easily, and I once saw a YouTube video by a Norwegian linguist, where there was a conversation between two people in what they reckoned was in old norse

We have a lot more trouble following Norwegian, sweedish and (god forbid) danish
We also read some of the old sagas in school
A bit hard to understand sometimes but manageble with the help of a teacher hehe
But yeah I've heard the same, that Icelandic is the closest to what the vikings spoke
Also we have protected the language a lot and always added new words rather than taking them from english (although english has had a great influence on icelandic youth culture today)
We study danish in school, for years, but still cant understand them when in Denmark
I think danes dont even understand each other
I've noticed that we share some words, we say *naut* in Icelandic
If you're eating beef it's called *nautakjöt*.
Haha it just means wednesday in icelandic
The correct form is miðvikudagur, or mið (middle) viku (week) dagur (day)
The day in the middle of the week
It used to be óðinsdagur (same as onstag in danish) but one of the bishops in iceland didn't like that and changed all the names of the weekdays
And yes, I assume its related to the English mid-week-day, English is full of germanic and norse influences
The accent closest to late old Icelandic would probably be "harðmæli" spoken in northern Iceland, primarily in the northeast, since it is a little bit more conservative
It is characterised by a rather clear pronunciation of p,t and k. People speaking with "harðmæli", for example, make a distinction between "sóti" and "sódi, which speakers of "linmæli", the vast majority of Icelanders, do not
Other accents like "flámæli" in the east and "vestfirska" of the western fjords are more innovative and thus not conservative
They're also virtually extinct, unfortunately
There's also the "hv"- pronunciation in the southeast where a distinction is made between "hvalir" and "kvalir", a rather conservative pronunciation, but it's also rapidly dying out
If you learn to replace them or might be easier
You can  just ignore 'ð' and imagine it's 'd' , ignore all the accents (éáíúýó) and replace þ við th
I think Norwegian has the ö(or ø) and the æ.
I can’t find any statistics on it but Reykjavík hasn’t always been the most populous town in Iceland’s history
A couple of hundred years ago it used to just be a small village, but now it has 2/3rds of the islands population (counting all of the capital area)
Same here in Iceland but it's been increasing over the last decade ever since Eyjafjallajökull accomplished decades worth of promo with one transAtlantic shut down
There used to be more but they've mostly died out
People from Akureyri prononuce some words a little bit differently but that's about it
Icelandic is kinda a dialect of Old Norse so it doesn't have many different dialects, maybe some people pronounce "ég" different but that's it
Some northerners pronounce some words differently but it really just stays the same
In Icelandic they are called "franskar kartöflur (French potatoes)" or "franskar (frenchies)" for short
We have that, mostly just cooking
I remember one class where we learned how to shine boots
Iceland definitely
Can neither confirm nor deny that
I can understand Swedish 80%, Norwegian 90%, and some Danish 70%. German is harder
Mainly Nordic languages seeing as how Icelandic is the closest related to Old Norse
Icelandic 100%
English 100% obviously
I am Icelandic and lived in Denmark
I under stand Swedish, Norwegian and Danish written language but only Danish in speaking language
Only recognise the connection words in German
The Dutch one was easier then the German, didn't really understand it but a little more then German
Low German and Bavarian didn't understand a thing
Afrikaans was very interesting but didn't understand it except for one word here and there
English I do understand and speak way better then I write
Icelandic I of course understand fluently
Faroese and Icelandic are really similar, I can understand Faroese really well
I understood almost everything
Yeah, it’s incredibly tough for a non-Icelander to read Icelandic and it’s much harder to comprehend someone speaking it in my opinion
Yeah but that doesn't mean I was good at it haha
During the World Cup it goes something like; Iceland first, then Denmark, and WHEN (not IF) they get knocked out, France
Yes, all the Nordic countries if Iceland isn’t playing
The nordic country (Norway,Denmark,Sweden,Finland)
No one haha
Our Icelandic "svindlmiði" has absolutely no ring or cleverness to it
Cheat=svindl miði=ticket
Million = milljón
Billion = milljarður
Trillion = billjón
Quadrillion = billjarður
So the same as in German
People often mix up "milljarður" and "billjón" so they use "billjón/trillion" when they're really talking about "milljarður/billion".
E.g. Jeff Bezos is worth 184 billjón dollars
This looks like it makes sense since he's worth 184 billion dollars in English but in Icelandic this translation would mean he's worth 184 trillion dollars
lol my bad
Beauty and nature
100% of energy produced is renewable
Also kind of an old language
Vikings and cold
Highest Internet use per person rate and us being nords
My country's name is a lie and our languages has changed very little over many years
We also have fish
Pathetic
China's authoritarianism will be exported to the entire West if we do not stand up to their shit
They are setting a dangerous example others WILL follow
I hated learning your numbers at school, just added a whole new level of difficulty at class haha
Where might one find such recipes
I’ll try my best haha
Thank you
Super, i will check this out
According to Spotify its these three:
Stjörnurnar]
Esjan]
Í kvöld er gigg]
Other popular songs that are played A LOT  on the radio are:
[Já það má]
[Sólarsamba]
[Takk fyrir mig]
[Það bera sig allir vel]
[Bernskan]
[Dýrka mest]
Probably either:
Herra Hnetusmjör - Stjörnunar [
Ingó Veðurguð - Takk fyrir mig [
Ours is quite meh
To much God
Not something you'd find in a dictionary but "Voffi" is sometimes used for dog (hundur) in Icelandic
Voff=woof the sound they make
It's mostly kids that say this but I've heard many adults use it as well
So while making popcorn, the popty ping pops until it pings
Perform or have if you’re using more formal words
The French and the way they protest so much
I know about those and you they make me sad, but I’m mostly looking at protest aimed at the government it’s like sometime they can’t breath a little and then there is a protest going on haha
While politicians can do all types of shit here and nobody blinks an eye
Nope wasn’t us
We did it after the financial crash 2008-2009
We kept us warm by burning down a Christmas tree and some random innocent bench
That is true
Buttttt it took a long time to get them to prison and they didn’t get that long of a sentence additionally they went to a luxury prison with a golf course (wish I was kidding)
And yes the pm went away with his tail behind his legs
but then he made an comeback with a new party and is now back in parliament
We do it also here
I have taken group selfie with some policemen, that is to say if they aren’t busy then it’s no problem
Oof thats awful
But I know that If protesters get mad here and violent they’ll get scared mainly because they are not used to us being furious
We mostly burned down Christmas trees and benches and put a flag of a pig on the parliament building
Brennivín, or burned wine
I asked my dad and it has a strong cumin taste, it's our version of a schnapps or aquavit and is around 40% alcohol by volume
Not really
Maybe because it's another germanic language or because we don't dub anything except childrens material here in Iceland, so alot of exposure
I learned the language mostly through video games and movies/tv shows

10 icelandic króna buys you ... nothing
100 icelandic króna buys you ... maybe a small juicebox or a crappy lighter
Nothing
Just overpriced services and products at tourist attractions
Only thing that comes to mind are jokes of “Hafnfirðingar”, those who live in the town of Hafnarfjörður
The joke always features a man from Hafnarfjörður and they do something wrong or stupid, and it’s usually set up as a question
I only heard these jokes when I was pretty young
For context, Hafnarfjörður is the third largest city/town in Iceland with 27k people
Just behind Kópavogur and far behind Reykjavík, they’re all in the Capital Area
I have no idea why they got chosen to be the butt of jokes but that’s just the way life is sometimes
Examples of jokes:
Usually on milk cartons there says “open here” on a top corner of it
The Hafnfirðingur interpreted it that he had to open the milk right then and there in the grocery shop, and did so
Why did the Hafnfirðingur put a chair up on his window before he went to bed
Well so the sun could set
How many Hafnirðingar can fit in an empty bus
One, because then it isn’t empty anymore
Why do Hafnfirðingar always sit on the closest bench to the cinema screen
Because they want to be the first ones to see the movie
Conversation between two Hafnfirðingar:
H1: You know what happened to me yesterday
I was stuck in an elevator for 3 hours
H2: Well that’s nothing, I was stuck in an escalator for 5 hours
Why do Hafnfirðingar always laugh so much on Easter
They’re finally getting all of the Christmas jokes
What do Hafnfirðingar get when they go to a prophet/mind reader
Refunded
Do you know why Hafnfirðingar never eat donuts
Because they don’t know what to do with the hole
Why do Hafnfirðingar always sneak quitely past Pharmacies
So to not wake up all the sleeping pills
Then there are tons of other Hafnfirðingar jokes that don’t translate well and only work in Icelandic
Hafnarfjörður, cause everyone calls them stupid
Each part makes fun of the other but I would say the west like who's from the west
Omg já
For me personally it’s [grjónagrautur] served with lifrarpylsa
It’s boiled rice pudding served with an Icelandic haggis
Yes, it probably came here with Danish cookbooks like so many other dishes
Edit: [Confirmed]
Most country names in Icelandic are similar to other languages, made to fit Icelandic spelling and grammar
Most of the differences are in European countries
Bretland - the U.K. (Literally just Britain)
I don’t know why we have never called them something like “Sameinuðu Konungsdæmin” (literal translation of United Kingdom), but Bretland is just really short and easy
We call the people there Bretar
Holland - the Netherlands
Yeah yeah you know the story, but actually saying “Niðurlöndin” just sounds incredibly wrong
Svartfjallaland - Montenegro
This one’s just literally translated: Svart (black), fjalla (mountain), land (country/land)
Hvíta-Rússland = Belarus
Just literally White Russia
Þýskaland - Germany
This one isn’t that interesting because it’s similar to scandinavian “Tyskland” and also the german “Deutschland”. But what’s interesting is what we call the Germans themselves: “Þjóðverjar”. “Þjóð” literally just means nation
And I think that “verjar” is an archaic word for men (my first guess was defenders because “að verja” means to defend and “verjandi” is a defender)
So in Icelandic, Germans are literally called Nation-Men
Svíþjóð - Sweden
Nation of the “Svíar”
Bandaríki Norður-Ameríku (BNA) - United States of America (USA)
In Icelandic, united and states are just one combined word, and we call americans “Bandaríkjamenn” though sometimes people ‘wrongly’ call them “Ameríkanar” or “Kanar/Kanamenn” for short
I don’t know why we had to specify that it’s north america though (Norður)
Germany = Þýskaland
America = Bandaríkin
And that's all I remember off of the top of my head
It's not at all the most ideal hosts but if we qualify I'll get as behind it as I did in 2018
The winter aspect will be strange especially here but its often too shit weather to watch it outside anyway so that wont be too much of a shock
Well our food is SHIT, like just plain ol' horrible
I'm talking *sheepballs* level disgusting (yeah, we used to eat those and alot of us still do once a year)
Except for maybe a few dishes (we have the world's best lamb fx
so there is something good) we just don't have a lot of good food
Edit: Also hot dogs
It's not really *traditional* and when you think about Iceland it's not necessary something that comes to mind, but when you come to Iceland, you have get your self an hot dog
Food:
Skyr, Lamb, Puffin, Anything Fish related and Hot dogs
Drinks:
We have a lot of good Beer and a spirit called Brennivín which is similar vodka in a way
And water
Most bottled water I've tasted abroad is worse than tap water here, it's an absolute must
Heilaga rómverska ríkið according to Icelandic wiki
Seems to be a direct translation from Holy Roman Empire, although a more direct translation would be "Holy Roman State"
Same as in german and english
Heilaga rómverska ríkið
Yes, and the movement is mainstream, has governmental and public support
We try to not put loanwords into our language but make new words that make grammatical sense, or repurpose old words not in daily use
Sími = telephone
Tölva = computer
Sjónvarp = television
Skriðdreki = tank (military)
Sjálfa = selfie
We also don’t support many characters like “c, q, w, z” so they’re forbidden
Not the op bút yes we do use these, english slang isnt popular or even used unless you are still learning the language
It literally translates to crawling dragon so I'm afraid it is unrelated
**Jealousy** vs **envy**. I just learned the difference recently and see it used incorrectly all over the place
**Envy** means you want something someone else has
Example: I'm envious of my sister's new car
**Jealousy** means you're afraid you're going to lose something if somebody else get it/something else
Afraid someone else's glory is going to outshine yours
Example: I'm jealous of my brother's car because it makes mine look like shit
You can be both jealous and envious at the same time but they are different feelings
Not really
A few people are climate change deniers but they are few
Not at all
I was thinking about negative effects
The EU has impacted every country in Europe
This is the secret to our wealth too
Everything is so bloody expensive our salaries have to keep up with it
Then we behave like kids in a candy store when we go abroad
Oh the Swiss have mastered the old economic law that "if you handle loads of money you're entitled to a cut of it" - the same principle bankers all over the world use to justify becoming rich off of other people's money
Reykjavík: Grafiti, Tourists and bad traffic
So yeah we kinda need more city's but until then this will have to do
Reykjavík: tourism
And swimming pools
Ç'est interdit
It's fun to yell at someone and it'so one of the few things I remember from high school French
Jag anar ugglor i mossen, "I sense an owl in the moss" it's a Swedish phrase but it sounds silly to me
Szukam dziewicy
[Our 2017 entry]
In my opinion that is the worst one iceland has sent to Eurovison, but these two below are awful too
[2001 Angel]
[2008 This is my life ]
Öfund is Envy
Afbrýðissemi is Jealousy
Öfundsjúkur is Envious
Afbrýðissamur is Jealous
(sjúkur is sick)
Definitions are the same as you said but many people use them interchangibly, especially kids, they will say either word but they’re obviously meaning envious because they don’t understand jealousy yet
We don't really have dialects in Icelandic, there are maybe some minor pronunciation differences between for example folk in Akureyri (where I live) and folk in Reykjavík or the Westfjords but otherwise everyone is very much speaks similar
Faroe Islands on the other hand, every village seems to have a new dialect of its own
Here it is called the Pfizer vaccine but often stated it is an international effort between (Turkish immigrants to Germany and) German and American companies
Lets see
Takk/Þakka þér fyrir (Icelandic), Thank you (English), Takk (Norwegian/Faroese), Tack (Swedish), Tak (Danish), Paldies (Latvian), Gracias (Spanish), Merci (French), Danke (German), Go raibh maith agat (Irish), Gura mie ayd (Manx), A*čiū* (Lithuania), Hvala (Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian) Obrigado (Portuguese), Dank je (Dutch)
Takk fyrir ! You can add that to the list
There are so many choices, but I think I'll have to go with Reykjavík. It has hot dog bars, and many other things
Well, you could switch the browsing tab, (controversial, new, rising, etc)
Or just unsubscribe from the popular subReddits
Former Yugoslav republic, Slovakia
**Czechoslovenia**?
I spent a lot of time in Slovakia
When I mention this to people I meet here in Iceland, about half confuse the two
From Wikipedia:
*Sihamoni remains unmarried and has no children
His father Norodom Sihanouk stated that Sihamoni "loves women as his sisters".*
He’s gay
Icelandic and Danish
Born and raised in Iceland, mom always spoke danish to us but we answered in Icelandic
I never felt like a real icelander
But at the same time, I wasn't a dane
I just didn't fit in in Iceland
After university I moved to Denmark
I feel more at home here, even though I miss my family
Don't know if the Danes will ever see me as a dane
But who cares
I’m half Icelandic half English per se but I am Icelandic
I hate my dad lol so I don’t really embrace my British identity due to that
My mum was Icelandic and danish herself though and I grew up speaking Icelandic and danish primarily because my dad was barely around but I feel 100% from Iceland
I’m dying here this is my home
The central highlands of Iceland would fit that description
Iceland in general makes you feel like that
It's not really a thing over here, think american football may even be more popular
If there are any leftovers it isn't frowned upon at all, nowadays waiters will bring you organic boxes to take the food home with
No, we do this all the time especially with the kids and I am not leaving food behind just because it may be “ordinary” to take it home
Same in Iceland
You drink what you bring
We will always share if someone asks for one but you wont be popular if you show up to a party with nothing to drink and expect everyone to give you some of theirs
I imagine that that depends on the alcohol prices in the country I suppose
Beer will be available for guests in Denmark for instance (cheap, especially if you buy it on the German border) but in Iceland you bring your own (ridiculously expensive)
I suppose it also depends on the age of the hosts of the party and the size
A large party for high schoolers will probably be BYOB, but a working adult might provide bevarages for a small-to-medium gathering
Same in Iceland so a weird nordic country thing ;)
I live near the border and you can always assume that the host has drinks if it's even a bit formal like a dinner party
If it's an informal gathering, then the host usually has more than enough drinks for himself at least, but most will bring something anyway
But like i said, near the German border so a box of beer (24 small ones) is around 60 DKK
Ég elska þig (I love you)
Definitely not
We're in darkness for half a year so we enjoy the sun whenever we can therefore we like being tanned
Nah, if anything you get a bit shamed for being too pasty, even in the winter
There is a normal-curve of tan-ness, too pale and you look unhealthy, too tan and you look overcooked
We love them
It shows a person has bothered to learn our language
The only nation to not acknowledge that we put in the effort to learn their language are Danes who seem to think it is selvfölgeligt that we would learn and speak Danish
There used to be regional dialects but nowadays there's only the dominating Reykjavik accent and the harder Northern accent that's especially strong around Akureyri and Húsavík where Will Ferrell is from
Not as far as I lnow
I would make it Greenland, but only on the condition that the current Greenland changes its name to Iceland
And yes it’s because I’m tired of the joke
Ice "We're greener than Greenland" land
Germany
Not a fan of the culture overall, Nordics are cold so I am used to it but I’ve never encountered such a closed off bunch
I agree
That Covid response was a cold reminder of the calculatory decision making that led to their neutrality in WWII
I know right
I thought we were bland and boring Icelanders but the Germans are so linear in their ways
Very unforgivable
Not even the Finns are that bad when they open up
I mean, Vikings sailed a lot there and Istanbul was even known as Mikligarður
To this day Nordics are still raiding there, but nowadays we raid the bars and beaches and leave with a bad sunburn
I have never heard of such a subculture here
I lived in Chile for many years and there they have [flaites]
Tappar . Like the cap on a bottle . Basically the same as a jock
Bolur (Iceland)
I can understand Norwegian, Swedish is a bit harder, and Danish is easy because I learned it in school
Faroese is understandable written But it's harder when it's spoken to me,  German is almost completely unintelligible tho
What about Icelandic
Gaman að kynnast þér, hvernig hefur þú það?
For me Swedish is decently understandable written but I doubt it's the other way around for you
Interslavic has always fascinated me, is it really that good
Correct
I understood that quite well
Amazing how similar our languages are, all tied to Old Norse
Yeah that's interesting
The word "Korleis" is completely alien to me though, but I definitely would've been able to piece that sentence together
"Hyggjeleg" also sounds like the Icelandic word "Huggulegt", which means "cozy". Møta also sounds more like something influenced by english
Møta- meet
Just a thought
Ok that actually makes alot more sense when you mention it
And also you're right with words meaning different things depending on context
If we take "mæta" for example
Ég mætti klukkan átta = I arrived at eight o'clock
Þeir mættust fyrir utan húsið = they met in front of the house
Ætlar þú að mæta
= are you going to show up
Ég ætla að mæta örlögum mínum = I'm going to face my destiny
And also you got me thinking, maybe møta and meet have the same origin- mæta
Since Old Norse significantly influenced English
I'm no linguist but I think it might makes sense
Also one question as I was trying to look this up some days ago but found nothing
Many people have told me that northern Norwegians, mostly older people have no difficulty speaking to Icelanders(meaning them speaking Norwegian and Icelanders speaking Icelandic
) Is this some dialect
If so what's it called
Because as far as I'm concerned Scandinavians usually can not understand spoken Icelandic to any real extent, except maybe one and one word
Wow every single one was really difficult to be honest haha
Of course if they all had subtitles in each dialect it would've been easier but it was very hard to make out words, very thick accents
If I'm not mistaken I think the Hafslo guy was talking about when he got home he would lie down and read a book
Probably way off but that's what I gathered
And with the Setesdal example pretty much the only thing I gathered was the Bear and the Fox were having a conversation
Björn- Bjørn, Refur- Reven, that's a given
But to be honest they were all equally difficult for me
Á = River, sheep, owns, on
Yes I agree, silly isn't it
In a sentence:
Ég á á sem er á bát sem fer yfir á.
I own a sheep that is on a boat going over a river
I could be related, Icelandic hardly changed at all for hundreds of years, we can read 1000 old texts and get the general meaning
Ya this checks out
Source: I'm Icelandic ;)
The real question is
Is the sheep on the boat real
I think that all Icelanders would say first iceland than there city and than eurepe
Idk man, I kinda enjoyed taking birds away from the cats, at first I wanted to save the bird but man after I realised the birds are long dead I just wanted to punish the cats
Heh
I got [quite] [a] [few] [options]
I'm not sure where to start since pretty much all of Iceland is unique and worth the visit from the volcanoes and glaciers to black sandy beaches, glaciers, fjords and basalt columns
But [Breidafjordur in west Iceland] my absolute favorite, it is scattered by lava-islands and basalt columns that create a haven for wildlife, both on land and in the sea
The seafood there is phenomenal
If you ever visit Iceland make sure to take a boat trip through Breidafjordur, guarded by volcanic glacier Snæfellsjökull where Jules Verne said was the entry to the center of the Earth in his famous book and also the peninsula where Nobel author Halldor Laxness set his book (Christendom) Under the glacier
Personally I like it best because of the fantastic sagas that took place in the area where my ancestors plotted, fought and died and the hot springs that feed natural hot-tubs and swimming pools like [Laugar] close to the Elf-Borg in Sælingsdalur where [Laxdæla] took place
lol, yes it certainly felt that way
To have all these wonders within a couple of hours from Reykjavik is pure luxury
I hadn't realized myself just how unique Iceland is until I started traveling the world myself as an adult and got a comparison
I think right now is the perfect time to establish "direct" flights between Oceania and Iceland, I'd LOVE to come visit your unique world too
Pikk means dick in Norwegian too
There’s been plenty of snow
Thank you, but Icelandic does not sound soft or pleasant
Wish I could hear it through your ears . Everyone just sounds like an asshole to me
JK :)
[Bessi Bjarnason reading children's stories has always sounded very pleasant to me]
Yeah but that's someone who gets paid for his voice of course he sounds good
Holy shit
Nope, but two of our first ladies have been foreign born, a Palestinian Brit and a Canadian
Yes
In Iceland the 6th of January is called Þrettándinn (meaning the thirteenth) because it's the thirteenth, and the last, day of Christmas
We celebrate it slightly, for example most people shoot their last remaining fireworks up that night
In iceland it's known as Þrettándinn, the thirteenth, and it's the last day of Christmas
It's celebrated with fireworks and bonfires around the country
Never drive off-road
It damages the nature which has an extremely hard time recovering and you will be fined
Go off-road
Break the speed limit
Take a shit 20m away from a highway
Die
Well, Wales actually *is* part of England
You'd be surprised
Yeah, this bullshit has to stop
Do you have more information about it
I'd rather not buy from these companies
YES
What Americans call Danishes and we Icelanders call Vinarbrauð (Vienna-bread)
All kinds of sugary pastries are simply better in Europe
Come to Iceland
We'll let you taste the difference
Our water is lava-filtered and mildly alkaline
Has very low amounts of trace minerals
Yeah, there's even a Polish shops specificity for Polish groceries everywhere
Yes, we have a few Polish stores
I know the tune and some of the lyrics of the British anthem
I also know some of the tune from the French one
Same
I also know the norwegian anthem because my grandma sings it almost 24/7
I don't think many people care about others wealth where i live
If you need confirmation you can just look at our glaciers
You can see how much they've shrunk from photoes
I don't think you can find a joke about him
He's the chillest and most down to earth guy in the country
But please correct me
I've been abroad for a few years and could do with a laugh
He collects unique socks
That he is a sexy beast
We can relate
Same in Iceland
How I envy you
We are way too tame
I'm hosting a hot-dog grill party tomorrow for my siblings, nieces and parents
No singing unfortunately, just a normal family eating grilled Icelandic pulsur in a bun with ketchup, mustard, fried onions and remúlaði.
I end up having to babysit the preschoolers in my family (trust me you dont want to babysit them) (siriusly there are like 6 of them like what
We get together in the countryside, eat good food, drink beer and sing songs all night when everyone's drunk
Far, får får får? Nei, får får ikke får, får får lamm
Dad, do sheep have sheep
No, sheep don't have sheep, sheep have lambs
Its Norwegian not Icelandic though
Icelandic
Valey á á á á.
Valey owns a sheep on the river
Á means: own, sheep, on and river
No idea why but we don't use á for sheep any longer, we use the word kind or lamb
One time we had a news story about all our sheep (Kindur) needed to be taken in because of a volcano and the German news changed it to all children (Kinder in German) needed to stay indoors because of the volcano
Let natural selection do its thing
it's a big church
**Hamar** \- it is pronounced with a hard R and sounds pretty badass to me
**Mjölnir** is also much more badass in Icelandic than in English, I honestly cringe when I hear it in the movies with both an incorrect Ö and an incorrect R.
The name Mjölnir means somebody who smashes stuff to smithereens (mylur=grinder) and is a very fitting name for a hammer
It smells way worse
Poo in open air smells A LOT more than submerged poo
Bloody interesting to an Icelander
Our weather is so unpredictable and constantly swings between warm&wet and coldn'dry so they wouldn't work for more than a couple of days
Therefore our winter boots were made of wool-socks an outer layer of fish-skin (roð)
winter version: [
summer version:  [
i.e. screw all the poor sick people that receive more healthcare than they pay in
One day you'll be old and need healthcare too
[Á Sprengisandi] is a good shout
It's about a man who is riding his horse over the barren, daunting highlands of Iceland and starts to worry about evil spirits, outlaws and elves as the sun starts to set
[Heyr himna smiður] is a hymn written in 1208 by Kolbeinn Tumason, a chieftain, on his deathbed after the [Battle of Víðines] You may have heard [this version of the hymn by Icelandic band Árstíðir] in a train station in Germany
[Sofðu unga ástin mín] a lullaby supposedly sung by Halla, the wife of the infamous 17th century outlaw Fjalla-Eyvindur, to their baby before throwing it into a waterfall so she could keep up with her husband while running away from the authorities
A more recent one is [Ég er kominn heim] It's more of your basic song about a man singing about how he will settle down with his loved one when he comes back home from his travels (presumably as a fisherman)
It's since gone to be the song [supportes of the Icelandic football team sing before and after games]
There's a town called Ísafjörður which means icefjörd meanwhile it's actually hell on Earth
signing Gamli Sáttmáli in 1262 with Norway, it's all been downhill from there

This feels kinda sad
Sunrise is 11:10 today and sunset is 15:32
I think we just get used to it
It gets dark at 15:00 here (3pm)
I’m thinking something like [this] slightly melancholic yet soothing
Some Icelandic fresh water
salted licorice
Sounds like dugnaður in Icelandic, which means something  like “hard-working” or diligent
Ok, interesting
I was in Tarragona this summer, and saw smoking areas in restaurants and of course people smoke outside
It happened at least two times that we left a restaurant because of smoking, I get nauseous of the smell and can't eat at the same time
Almost everything is fucking closed at that time due to Covid
Bar would have been closed well before 11
45pm
So I would snack on something at home
Anything edible
Maybe order a Dominos, if they are still open
Normally they would be but nowadays
I don't even fucking bother to look it up
Shawarma, pizza or a submarine sandwich (not from Subway, okay sometimes from Subway) were my go-to's when I was at my drinking best
I ride a gravel bike in the summer and a electric mountain bike with wide studded tyres in the winter
Due to the hills and wind here, most commuters I see have road bikes or e-bikes
Regular hybrids are common in the summer
Recently those escooters are getting more and more common on the bike lanes
Relatively few people bike year round due to the weather, but that number is growing steadily
Those that do are a bit better equipped than the regular commuters in Europe, fancy light road bikes are common in summer and cyclocross bikes or hardtails with studded tyres in winter
Two
First period of freedom were the Settlement period (874-930) and Commonwealth period (930-1262)
Then the Norwegians and Danes ruled over us from 1262-1944
Then freedom came again with the independence from Denmark and the birth of the Republic of Iceland in 1944
We say Langtíburtistan, which litterally means far-away-istan
Langtíburtistan
Technically we do not have self-defense in Iceland
We only have a paragraph in our criminal code that allows for removal of sentence if you do something to prevent illegal attacks that have already started
The main provisions are:
You cannot use force that is more than the force use by the attack in question
You cannot cause more damage than the original attack would have caused, or cause more danger
Sometimes 1 and 2 can be ignored, if the person in question was so panicked that they couldn't really be faulted for going overboard
It's up to a judge to decide
This hasn't happened all that much tbh
Violent crime is kinda rare here
Well, Icelandic history is basically just "people arrive and settle, fish, some books are written, fish, 100 years of boredom, fish, civil war that noone actually cares about, fish, many hundred years of boredom with occational volcano outbursts, fish, plague, fish, poverty, fish, independence yay ". So we just spend one semester on Icelandic history
Reykjavík (Smoky bay) when the first settlers arrived on the island, they gave this place its name namely because of all the geothermal energy and geyser in the area
Probably settled there because it was a warm place to stay at
Reykjavík's name literally translates to Smoky Bay, named since when the first settlers arrived here they saw what they thought was smoke (actually steam from the geothermal areas nearby)

A football tournament played each year in the town of Bolungarvík. Basically football played in knee-deep mud

The Nammibar in Hagkaup on Saturdays might feel a bit claustrophobic if you dont like being crowded by masses of hungry sugar craving kids and adults taking advantage of the 50% offer on all candy :D
But for real I can't think of anywhere (in the towns at least, Icelandic nature is a different beast) I would feel unsafe, Breiðholt in Reykjavík has a reputation for being the city ghetto but even there is pretty tame compared to anywhere in mainland Europe
Breiðholt looks and feels a bit more unsafe than other parts of the country but it's not really that dangerous
The crime rate over there is about the same as in other parts of the city
You're maybe more likely to get things taken from your car if you leave it unlocked or get your bicycle stolen in Breiðholt but that's about it
There's a higher rate of low income households and there are big apartment blocks with dark alleyways
Also a third of the people living in Breiðholt are immigrants so all these things combined have given it the reputation of a ghetto but people who live there and have grown up there have been actively trying to remove that stamp and the stigma around that part of the city
[Pic of how ghetto it can look by Icelandic standards lol]
[There are nicer parts as well]
> From your experience, which nationalities are most present among inmigrants in that area
I've never lived in Breiðholt but I'd imagine it's eastern Europeans (mostly Poles, Lithuanians and Latvians) and some Thai and Filipinos since those are among the biggest immigration groups over here
lol yeah that's a "ghetto"
You will probably laugh but, [Langspil] is our traditional instrument and it only has two strings

Probably the Reykjavík summit, where Reagan and Gorbachev met in 1986 to discuss stopping or limiting the usage of ballistic weapons, a deal that was eventually made official in 1987
For Iceland it’s the blue lagoon, it way too expensive 40-60€ (sure you can spend the whole day there) but everything is expensive there like food and massage
You can have avocado toast for 20€ (I’m not kidding)
Also to avoid are the Puffin Shops in downtown Reykjavik and other tourist locations, e.g. Geysir
Everything is waaaaaay overpriced
You could get everything they are selling in these stores a lot cheaper at the Fleamarket (Kolaportið) in Reykjavík.
Edit: as u/Lilbed023 pointed out don’t buy the cans filled with “fresh Icelandic mountain air” in the tourist traps
it’s just empty cans
I think they are actually [on sale right now for 4€] haha
Yeah Exactly
And there are plenty of natural geothermal pools on the island that are safe to swim in
I think there might be a map somewhere on google with the pools locations :)
Oh How could have forgotten those blasted cans

Cool, where you on some introduction trip or something else
Because they never give anything for free there

Compared to most of the other countries here, Iceland starts counting street level as the 1st floor (hæð) and the one one above that is 2nd floor etc
Anything below the first floor is the basement (kjallari), there's no "0" point
However if the basement is half underground (súð) then that might be considered the first floor instead of a basement and the first floor is a second floor
There are no rules here
We have the names but how people use them seems to differ a bit
In apartment buildings ground floor is generally marked as first floor
In spoken language both are used
It’s chaos
I was thinking more of like houses with multiple entrances where you walk down a few steps to go to one apartment and up some steps to get to the other, making no floor being on street level, giving it floor ambiguity

Cons: Everything is extremely expensive, the weather, selfish idiotic government, ridiculous loaning system

Hello Darkness my old friend
Correct
We have something called Verðtryggð lán (Indexed linked loans) basically most of our loans have about 3-7% so it can take up to 40 years maybe to pay for a housing loan
[This TED talk can maybe explain better than me]
Yes, I think they got here some years ago (at least according to some news I googled) with some cargo, but they aren’t many
Yeah you understood right
And yeah I think I heard somewhere that we have a similar system
And also I think we have both had a wonderful time with the IMF (if you are from Argentine)
(I don’t like the IMF at least)
[I finally found a English article about the loaning system in Iceland ]
This article is from 2013 but still when I read through it still seems like not much has changed when it comes to the loading system
[Móðuharðindin ] or the eruption of Laki
Almost wiped out the nation for good, killed around 50-85% of the livestock and about quarter of the people

Everything is super fucking expensive, crippling housing market, shitty weather 9 months a year with little sunlight, wayyyy to many tourist's and corrupt politicians
Here in Iceland it rises around 10:50 and goes down around 15:45
Our clock is an hour and half wrong, because people want more sun in the afternoon and to be closer to the European timezone
But at least you guys have a lot of sun in the summer like us
That's exactly how I feel, I find it so cozy

Iceland's history can be split like this (please someone correct me if I'm wrong)
Settled in 874
Commonwealth 930-1262
Union with Norway 1262-1397
Danish rule (This includes the Kalmar union and the Dano-Norwegian realm) 1397-1918
Kingdom of Iceland 1918-1944
Republic of Iceland 1944- present day
It was literally made 1000 years ago
874 AD, one of the very ancient countries still inhabited today
Probably 874, when when Ingólfur Arnarson settled here in near Reykjavík permanently
Yes of course
How silly of me
That wouldn't fall under Danish rule I guess but the Danish king was still the king of Iceland during that period so not fully freed from the Danes just yet ;)
Aw ok :(
Indeed
Independent with a Danish king and with Denmark representing Iceland in international matters which is why I said Iceland hadn't absolutely gotten rid of Danish influence just yet
Same here, called heimilisfræði.
Wouldn't like at all
You know, I wake up everyday thankful because we didn’t have Danish bibles
A small price to pay in the big picture
In Iceland it's called "Sumardagurinn fyrsti" or "First day of summer"
\- And it is a National Holiday
We have it on the first day of summer which is the Thursday after the 18th of April
We are really friendly to each other
Really common to be friends with neighbours over here

I remember how blown my mind was as a kid when I played Age of Mythology with my friend and we heard spoken [Icelandic] There's also [this] awesome Taiwan tea commercial where the actors speak Icelandic
And there have been quite a few movies and TV-shows where some characters in the movie are supposed to speak Icelandic, usually it's been pretty random and bad
Incest and inbreeding
Historically it was frowned upon, family trees and relations have been documented quite well and compared to [other European nations] we’re apparently not inbred
I find that joke quite annoying
I sometimes feel like people think we live in little cabin in the mountains with no connection to the world

[Skyr] yogurt
hmmm, I don't think so
What kind of gröt are you referring to
Can you provide links showing how it is made
It used to be considered a meal in itself but it is also used as dessert especially when mixed with berries, sugar and cream
No, it is a type of yogurt, it is not cooked or maid of grain
It is high-protein yogurt unique to Iceland
Not at all common in Iceland
As stories tell, some of our ancestors came from far away lands amongst the stars
They had a great ruler that had immense power gifted by the gods - he could control thunder and lightning, and throw things much bigger and heavier than himself
He ruled over many lands with a fierce hand
There was an uprising of the peoples in those lands and the ruler built a great weapon to quell the voices
They only grew louder so he used the weapon to destroy some of the lands with the most uprising
The peoples attacked the weapon but the ruler's forces were strong
A small boy was able to sneak through and with the gods favour was able to destroy the weapon from within
The ruler while still powerful no longer had the eye of the gods with his most strongest warlords turning against him saw his lands fall into turmoil
Many people fled on ships to find more peaceful shores
One such group of ships was in tranquil waters on a clear night, they were floating through the stars
When suddenly the water disturbed and the ships were swallowed by whirlpool of white that spat them out into the void of the deep
Those who survived found themselves on these shores with broken ground and stars in the sky they did not know
The name of the gods were banished so their gifts could no longer be bestowed and those who wanted to rule in turmoil were quickly dealt with
Not exactly hated but our primeminester, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, is in a left party but she started a government with a party which is more to the right
[Ólafur Pétursson] A traitor to Iceland and Norway in WWII
He led to dozen of Norse resistance fighters being capture and sent to prison camps or being executed
He was known as the “Icelandic executioner” in Norway
He only had to spend two years in prison because he had some connections to the Icelandic government

Iceland has a few
The most famous one is the Lögur worm (Lagarfljótsormur) which was caught on tape w more info here:
Then we have Nykur, a horse whose hoofs are on backwards
It comes from the ocean and if you get on back it will try to run with you back in
But the best (imo) legendary creatures are the Guardians of Iceland stemming from an old saga about a Norwegian magic who was commissioned by Harald king of Norway to scout Iceland for a possible invasion
The magic man supposedly turned himself into a seal and swam to Iceland where he was received by a plethora of 'vættir' or creatures with 4 main creatures guarding the country, one on each main side: In the South a berg-giant, in the West a huge bull, in the North a huge eagle and in the East a fire-spewing dragon
So the country is impenetrable and the king opted against invasion
These four main creatures are shown in the Icelandic coat of arms and are minted on the Icelandic króna coins

Hnefatafl
It’s an assymetric abstract board game with one player playing as the white side with fewer pieces and a King piece, and the other side has the more plentiful black pieces
I don’t remember exact rules (the original rules are lost anyway) but it has something to do with surrounding units to kill them
It was played in the 4th to 12th century before regular old chess mostly replaced it
Fun fact, in Icelandic chess is either called Skák or Tafl, the first coming from persian “shah” (in english that’s chess and check) but the second word, Tafl, comes from Hnefatafl
And you don’t really ever ask someone “viltu skáka
” But rather “viltu tefla
”. Both meaning “do you want to play chess”. A chessboard can be either called Taflborð or Skákborð.
We only have one city and most people have heard of that one but maybe a good example for us is Reykjanesbær. It's where Keflavík airport is located (named after one of the municipalities that make up Reykjanesbær) and has a population of around 19 thousand making it the biggest town outside the greater Reykjavík area
Akureyri is a decent shout as well, it's probably better known than Reykjanesbær since it's a popular tourist destination (Tintin visits it in "The Shooting Star" as well) and it also has around 19 thousand people and is considered the capital of northern Iceland
Think there are plenty of way smaller towns though that many people know of, especially those who have travelled to Iceland like Húsavík, Seyðisfjörður and Vík but like I said I wouldn't expect the avarage person to know these places
Lund is well known in Iceland because a lot of Icelanders go there to study
Also because a famous character on a Icelandic comedy TV show had a fetish for Sweden and kept talking about Pelle Lundgren, his Swedish friend from Lund
I've heard of Rovinniemi
Bodo and Tromso are known if you follow football
Everyone in Iceland knows Gothenburg (or Gautaborg as we say) mainly because of the football team and because of the number of Icelanders who move there (this is the case for many Scandinavian cities)
Since we get a lot of football news from Sweden because of the Icelandic players who've played there through the years, I (and many Icelanders ) have heard of a lot of Swedish cities
From the top of my head:
Norrköping
Helsingborg
Kalmar
Östersund
Halmstad
Borås
Örebro
Often simply as *Austurríki-Ungverjaland* (Austria-Hungary) or as *Austurrísk-ungverska keisaradæmið* (Austro-Hungarian Empire)

No carrion though,
Not many people have heard of the Geirfugl, the Arctic flightless 'penguin'  which was hunted into extinction, the last bird of its kind being caught in the 1800's. It's our Dodo

Then again it might depend on the type of pizza is being cut
Is it American style pizza (Dominos) or Italian style pizza
A pizza cutter can sometimes move toppings around or cut them improperly
Maybe scissors alleviate that, I don't know

I would call this missing the forest for the trees
There have been some developments, especially in the Icelandic vowel system in regards to the old long vowels and (at least "classical") Elfdalian has some interesting conservatisms (most notably the old quantity distinctions lost in every other Germanic language, including Icelandic, English and German) but compared to every other North Germanic language and dialect Icelandic conservatism in regard to grammar, vocabulary, general structure and in some cases even phonology is nothing short of striking, to the point where I'd call it hard to argue with a straight face that it is not as simple as as people make it out to be
Edit: for instance while Elfdalian verb conjugations and noun declensions are conservative relative to standard Swedish they are still much less so than Icelandic which preserves the Old Norse morphology almost perfectly
That could only have been political
Faroese and Danish split before the Faroes were even settled
>We're discussing pronounciation here
Are 'we'? :)
While Icelandic has like Faroese, Danish and Finland Swedish (and possibly other dialects
) lost the pitch accent I would seriously question whether that's a bigger pronunciation innovation than the continental palatalization, erosion of unstressed syllables and old vowel length mergers - although on that last point while preserving the old distinctions pretty faithfully the actual articulation of the old long vowels is famously eccentric in Icelandic
But again I dispute your premise that 'we' are only discussing pronunciation here
If you discuss anything but there is hardly anything to discuss because in essentially other way Icelandic is indisputably the most archaic North Germanic language, and only Faroese comes even close
Looking at the big picture I think it's as simple as people say it is
This discussion was linked from r/Iceland and so he likely didn't realize the title
This user is even more fascinating in that thread than here, although that's all in Icelandic
I went on a wild ride in that thread
It is the title of the thread but I'd argue that the discussion that started with the statement that Icelandic was the closest to Old Norse was broader
At least that's how I interpreted it
>I've only been discussing the sound of the language, at least
That was your first comment in the comment chain so I guess that's true by default
But starting from the comment about Icelandic's conservatism I don't think that was what was on everyone else's mind
>I don't know what you mean here
Yeah, I wasn't very clear, I meant the lack of distinction between historical long and short vowels
Elfdalian famously and uniquely keeps them distinguished by length to this day but most other dialects have merged *i* and *í*, *e* and *é*, *u* and *ú* and *ø* and *œ*. Icelandic of course isn't free from mergers, most notably derounding *y*/*ý*/ey to *i*/*í*/*ei* along with Faroese and merging *œ* with *æ*, *ø* with *ö* and *ǫ́* with *á* simplifying the 19 vowel system (of early "standard" Old Icelandic) to 13
But what I meant to contrast with was that many Scandinavian dialects have made the new post-quantity shift vowel lengths phonemic (with innovated quality distinctions thrown in for good measure) while these are strictly allophonic in Icelandic with the historical vowel lengths still being phonemically distinct in the form of new vowel qualities and diphthongs
>It's a big part of what defines the "sound" of the language
So are many other factors
Palatalization in particular has had a pretty profound impact on the sound of northern Scandinavian
It would be interesting to see which modern Norwegian speakers (say Oslo dialect or whatever) identified more with, no pitch+palatalization (Finland Swedish
) or pitch+no palatalization (Southeastern Jutlandic
) although realistically there are too many other variables to make a good test

Can someone fill me in on what's happening
This is the reason, I don't even l like any of it
But I need it anyway because that's where everyone else is
In many cases there's one person in each car
In my city (Reykjavík) it's almost the norm
The space required is kind of ludicrous
They involve faster movement to a point - the cars I see are stuck in traffic
Well I say "stuck in traffic", they *are* traffic
>so they stay in the public space for less time
That public space isn't recovered though is it
Roads can't be used when not in use by cars
They're roads, they don't suddenly switch to free roaming public spaces once no cars are on them
> They do sometimes, when people want that: for public gatherings, festivals, markets
That's a very limited amount of road space for a very limited amount of time
>know places that close for cars almost every weekend
When there are enough of those events in a place (usually the city center) that place tends to close the roads permanently
And those places are doubtless much better for it
City centre traffic is rarely fast moving and the roads take up too much space and cause related issues namely safety and pollution
I want to take my youngest in town and let her walk without fear of her walking in front of a car
I want to enjoy walking around without diesel fumes in the air
We have closed traffic in a large part of the city centre in Reykjavík seasonally and it's a far better experience
Parts are open for shop deliveries in the morning and that's it
Honestly, the weather's not that bad
There are many handful of winter/autumn storms and that's it
The main bus routes are every 10 minutes to every 15 minutes during peak times
The city and suburb towns are investing in a massive city line project to connect the suburban areas to the city centre with an express route
Traffic is becoming too much and we can't add more roads for two-car households
People here are fond of wearing $600 coats
They can finally get some use out of them

Alright so as an Icelander who now lives in Norway I always thought the amount of forest cover Norway had was ridiculous, long car rides blended together as there was nothing to see but trees compared to the varied landscapes of Iceland
But if Norway is only 39% I can't imagine 69& or 72%.
There are two things to consider
First is that we don't actually know how much of the country was covered by forests
The range is pretty huge, with the lowest estimates being around 8% and the highest at 40%. It is however clear that even at the lower end, significantly more of the country was covered in trees
"Human" activities (ie: mostly sheep) are probably the primary reason the forests disappeared
Other important factors are the "Little Ice Age", frequent volcanic eruptions, and the chopping of forest to make charcoal
The second, and to foreigners probably the more important one, is to remember what an Icelandic forest actually is/was
They were made of birch, not the massive evergreen trees you see in Scandinavia
[Look at this] for example
We have a joke in Iceland that goes "What do you do if you get lost in a forest in Iceland
" to which the answer is "You stand up". These birch trees can grow into proper "forests" but it is highly likely that just as today, a large portion of historic forests were mostly low-ish birch bushes
Most of the larger types of trees you see in Iceland today are imported species
The conservation and restoration of nature is important in Iceland, and within my lifetime I've seen great improvements
I really hope we can get things to a more reasonable rate in the next decades

All these people here arguing wich political and economical system is the best, people dont realise that no matter what system you use now, its never going to work as well as it should have, you would have to fix the underlying world problems first such as poverty, healthcare and nature preservation as examples
I couldnt care less how many people died under what regime, nazis are responsible for 11 million, soviets 56-62 millions, Maoist 49-78, the imperial Japanese 6 million, the british 35 million, the french 4 million, the italians 1 million, the Usa 1 million, belgians 15 million, the spanish 8 million, its all a mess, but it is a fact that its history and the only thing we can do is be happy that it happened so we can not do it again and improve upon improvements
Btw just to clarify the death numbers are debated as all things are and thats not something i care to debate about, however if you want to debate with me about my opinion feel free to do so
There were about 5-6 million people killed in the camps and the rest is civillian deaths from german bombing and such, i did not include the deaths of combatants for the german or allied side, if that were the case that number would be (most likely) roughly 30-40 million, as all sources site differently
The 11 million number is real, and i did my research tyvm
The reason why i dont want to argue about such numbers is because all the sources are diffrent so you wont get anywhere witho  arguing about it
I had no interest in getting the non combatants deaths for the soviet union but famine and work camps were a large majority and you can reduce the number down too 36 million soviets if you dont want to include ww2 combatants
Secondly the main point of communisim is equal distrubution of wealth between people, not fixing poverty or healthcare
Such distrubution requires incredible ammount of mangagment effort and therefore communisim cant work untill in the future
Communisim also cant work with the precence of human leadership, as people and politics can never be trusted
How would i fix poverty you ask
For a start i would cut millitary budgets and build housing for people and give them enough subsidies just for necessities and create a goverment funded education, after graduation its their choise weather or not they stay poor
Capitalisim isint a single reason for poverty
And even if you managed to create a functioning communist society today, there would still be poverty
Why do you think i think that
Because i live in a utopian capitalist country with no millitary, almost no crime and poverty, with everything to fix poverty

This phrase isn't used that much in Icelandic and when it is it could also be Greek instead of Hebrew
A much more common phrase for saying that a foreign language seems strange and incomprehensible, is *Hvaða hrognamál er þetta
* meaning "What kind of roe language is this
" (the word roe in English means fish eggs)
Hebreska
Er það eitthvað ofan á brauð?
I have never heard this in Icelandic
We sometimes say „þetta er myndletur” (or something similar IIRC) which translates to “these are Hieroglyphs to me”
I've never heard someone say Hebrew
Always chinese
I was about to just write "fish eggs" but then remembered that I'd seen a proper English word somewhere, which I found amusing not least because it's clearly a cognate to the Icelandic word and probably of Scandinavian origin in English
So I looked it up again to be sure
Any native speaker of Icelandic older than 12 would know what "hrogn" is however, if only because it's a traditional type of food liked by the older generation

It summer in that picture
Hallgrímskirkja = "Hallgrímur's church" or "Church of Hallgrímur"
So the title doesn't seem so stupid if you choose the second interpretation:
The Church of Hallgrímur church
In icelandic we would just say, "Hallgrímskirkjan", where the '-n' is equivalent to 'the', when talking about a church directly (the nominative case)
There are four cases in Icelandic, so you might actually use one of four words to refer to this church:
* "Hér er Hallgrímskirkjan" = Here is the church of Hallgrímur
* "Ég er að tala um Hallgrímskirkjuna" = I am talking about the church of Hallgrímur
* "Ég kem frá Hallgrímskirkjunni" = I came from the church of Hallgrímur
* "Ég for til Hallgrímskirjunnar" = I went to the church of Hallgrímur
When you combine these 4 cases with singular/plural and definite/indefinitive, you end up with [16 words for 'church']
This can get even more out of hand for adjectives ([green] and nouns ([to go]

How is that surprising, that is very easy to eyeball on literally every map ever of Iceland
The vast majority of the country is uninhabitable, but not because of glaciers
No it really doesn't. A mountain range covered by snow looks nothing like a glacier
To clarify (because I'm being downvoted by people who have never seen glaciers
), this is the case on both maps (where glaciers are white and mountain ranges not) and in real life (they look very much different)
The only option is that you might be confused looking at satellite images taken when the country happens to be covered in snow
but that's not a map
No it won't man, that's just completely wrong
I have literally not seen a single map ever of Iceland that has mountain ranges covered by snow marked similarly to glaciers
Sure, but the process takes a very, very long time
Only the highest mountains in Iceland hold a glacier cap throughout summer
So these cap glaciers might look something like snow covered mountains, but they're only a tiny, tiny fraction of the total glacial area covered in Iceland
And even then, they really don't look like it in real life
You can quite easily tell the difference
The real glaciers look completely different

Everyone who lives outside of US are happy about it
It's often quite the opposite
Most ppl over here wanna live in mainland Europe
And also it was a joke
Yea no it was a joke there are worse places but US is pretty bad tho

So why don't they leave the EU, if they believe Poland is carrying the entire European Union

I came from a rural area and was the last of my friends to leave home at age 19
Then in Reykjavík I've met a lot of people in their late twenties who still haven't moved out
It's like night and day
Being between France and the UK
What could possibly go wrong
On the bright side the Scots are probably next to our borders
Where’s Iceland
Edit: Nvm it’s now in Andorra fml
Stuck between France and the UK with no way out
Oh JOY
Guess the Roman empire never ventured north to conquer the Nordics
Too far away from home base
They'll be Germans again in like 15 years
Don't worry
Someday we'll have a thread about Germany in /r/europe that doesn't end up making fun of them losing two world wars and persecuting a whole lot of people for stupid reasons
I certainly won't help, though, I just feel compelled to make the jokes
I think the government in Iceland is doing the same
I’ll have to find the news article about it though
Can we get this in Iceland too please
For example, [The Blue Lagoon paid out over 12 billion isk in dividends between 2012-2019] yet they got aid from the govt for these "trying" times
If they were a truly respectable company, they would've kept a larger share of profits in the company to keep it running in case shit went south
For conversion comparison
12 billion isk is roughly equivalent to $82,7 million
Finally found it, it took a while (sorry I’m on my mobile)
[Companies asking for help ]
In short companies asking for help from the government are forbidden to pay out yields to themselves or invest in their own company afterwards
Get along with Russia lol
War hurts both sides
Heading there in one month - can't wait
Ah thanks man
Just hiked from Mestia to Ushguli - treating myself to a guesthouse here
Then heading to Tbilisi and up north for more camping
Any recommendations along the way
I feel your pain so much, this is exactly how annoying the weather in Iceland can be as well
Just when you think spring has arrived, you're slapped in the face with a week of sleet and hailstorms
Worth noting that everything roughly north of modern-day France was under ice
See, this is how you include Iceland on the map if there isn't enough space
Lol
It's geographically, economically and culturally close to us
football
Three times they came and three times We kicked them right back
Next time we’ll start raiding their shores again
Plus they got some good tv
Yep, loads of people from Iceland go to the UK for recreational purposes, as well as business
It's pretty popular to take a weekend trip to the UK for shopping (or it was before Covid anyway)
Surprisingly, despite our small population I almost always meet a fellow Icelander when im on vacation
Just stop by an H&M store and you’ll see plenty of us :D
Haha indeed
To make it even cheaper most people stay away from London with Manchester and Edinburgh being popular shopping destinations
Well it makes the nazi protestors ridiculous, but I still think a reasonable protest against the refugee issue is fine
Just don't get violent
Unfortunately nazis are just the ones who are motivated the most to protest, and, of course, get violent
Not reasonable people
I'm so conflicted
All of /r/europe is trashing the Danish these days, now I'm all for trashing the Danish, after all it's a national pastime

Surely France is also double not invited

Has nothing to do with being christian (most of us are not religious at all)
It has to do with the fact that producing it is ILLEGAL

Fun fact: Iceland was the first country to recognise Lithuanian independence in 1991
Iceland, as [the first country to recognise Lithuania] is sad for not being invited to the party
We send our best greetings none the less and wish you a pleasant day
Happy independence day
Til hamingju Litháen
Gleðilegan sjálfstæðisdag Litháen :)
Til hamingju með afmælið Litháen
Where the fuck is Iceland
We were the first to recognise they’re independence
We live too far away to come to the party anyway
Recognising the Baltics is one of the highlights of the Icelandic foreign history
It is one of the few times that a country has done something that everyone, including their most important allies, told them not to do, simply because it was the right thing to do
Makes you proud to be icelandic
Yes
Yes it is
-_-
That’s hot af dude
That's too hot
I'd melt
Can confirm
At 20° it's just not comfortable anymore
This being said, I think the older you get, the warmer you prefer it
Seems to be the case for my grandparents at least
They even bought a house in Spain
It's very hard to know if that's because more people go untested through the disease or if the medical system is actually saving more people
I guess we will eventually find out with antibody tests
Even the death statistics can be very skewed so we can't really know other then to compare total deaths between months in years
And in 4 months it'll be the UK in 1992
Germany doing something shady i suppose
People ski around in iceland
It's the highlands
It's uninhabitable, being volcanic plains, tundra, or really rough terrain
You need a 4x4 to get to most of it under the best of conditions, and most of those roads are closed over winter time anyway
Any town that would be built there would be completely dependent on all resources, and be virtually cut off from the rest of the country for 9 months a year
Its mainly mountains and tundra inland and is called hálendið or the high lands
Uhm excuuuse me, We don’t have Santa Claus, we have the [Yulelads]  which are way better than some stupid jolly lad
That circular road is the ringroad, and yes, most Icelandic towns are a hop, skip, and a jump away from it
Even the towns that aren't on or near route 1 (like Flúðir or the westfjord towns) have some connection to the route eventually
However the entire coastline and the lowland interior has towns
There are a good 60 municipalities in Iceland and some are made up of more than a single town/urban center
You cant even make 100 in iceland
There are fricking speed bumps literally every 400 meters
And the roads are shite
Source  I’m Icelandic
Edit: to add to this there are not that many straight chapters of road here on the island, always twists and turns that (I believe are made to slow us down :’D )
This hasn't been true for DECADES
Currently Looks like [this]
I dunno, we have nothing better to I guess
I’m guilty of that too
When I’m sure that there are no cops ahead
Ive mostly driven in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, compared to them the roads are shite
>  Back in 2014 I did a complete tour of the ring road, and it only contained a couple of kilometres of gravel
Those were paved in 2019
It's all paved now
well it used to be true so if you've talked to some older people who traveled Iceland that's what they would've seen
Probable where that comes from
There are plenty of gravel roads all over the country, it's just that the highway is all paved
Agreed, although I would remove the x from it
Don't worry, it will in September
Is that the same AAP that was pro-FGM for a short while until they caved under political pressure
For those interested here's a response to the AAP from a whole bunch of top-ranked European doctors writing in the journal Pediatrics: [Cultural Bias in the AAP’s 2012 Technical Report and Policy Statement on Male Circumcision]
Here's the Abstract:
>The American Academy of Pediatrics recently released its new Technical Report and Policy Statement on male circumcision, concluding that current evidence indicates that the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks
The technical report is based on the scrutiny of a large number of complex scientific articles
Therefore, while striving for objectivity, the conclusions drawn by the 8 task force members reflect what these individual physicians perceived as trustworthy evidence
Seen from the outside, cultural bias reflecting the normality of nontherapeutic male circumcision in the United States seems obvious, and the report’s conclusions are different from those reached by physicians in other parts of the Western world, including Europe, Canada, and Australia
In this commentary, a different view is presented by non–US-based physicians and representatives of general medical associations and societies for pediatrics, pediatric surgery, and pediatric urology in Northern Europe
To these authors, only 1 of the arguments put forward by the American Academy of Pediatrics has some theoretical relevance in relation to infant male circumcision; namely, the possible protection against urinary tract infections in infant boys, which can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss
The other claimed health benefits, including protection against HIV/AIDS, genital herpes, genital warts, and penile cancer, are questionable, weak, and likely to have little public health relevance in a Western context, and they do not represent compelling reasons for surgery before boys are old enough to decide for themselves
>...because the comparison doesn't hold up against the worst forms of FGM
But it holds up against some forms of FGM, right
No love for iceland ; - ;
Icelandic railway system is on point though
We have a railway track
it's about 3 meters
It even has a (non-functional) locomotive on it

You are forgiven
We don't have trains though so it is forgivable
>Jesus was born around 5 AD
You got a source for that
Hmm
I didn't even realize that there a consensus among scientists that Jesus was a real person
But then, if their sources are primarily the Bible then surely the assertion that Jesus was real struggles to move beyond that
>According to the Bible
Surely you cannot use the Bible as a reliable source when it comes to history
Can you give me an example of such sources
Then surely sentences like "Jesus was born around 5 A.D." don't work, right
They'd have to come with the warning "But that's sourced from the Bible, so you know
Icelander here
Grew up in a 350 square meter house in a suburb
Currently living in a 150 square meter apartment in a much more centralized location
Both are about as expensive, but my apartment is surrounded by all the amenities I need
Stores, bars, restaurants, theaters, gyms
you name it
All within a walking distance
I don't even need a car, I can walk to work
Or take a very short bus ride if the weather is exceptionally shitty
I also have a view of the city, the sea and the mountains surrounding it, a glacier in the distance and some old volcanoes
I also have balconies I can close, so even in the dead of winter I can sit in the sun and just chill out there
A house has a lot of benefits
But so do apartments

However it would just be making the same point with the only difference being someone would be able to say "bUt ThAt AlSo IsNt ThE sAmE pOlAnD"
Or we could just start by clearing up what each and everyone means when they say *country*.
That should subsequently solve all these arguments on its own
A match made in hell
I feel ashamed
Iceland
I...I..I don't get it
TFW you only had Finland and Norway but never got Denmark and England like the Danes did because your King got shot in the head by his own guys
To imagine that Denmark would have so much land and oil if it just didn't lose Norway all those years ago
Heck, imagine if you guys still owned *England*.
They'll just come back with a particularly voracious appetite, having no idea why they're so famishes, but knowing exactly what needs to be done to fix it
Then we have Iceland, heating all our homes up with renewable energy, yet not getting a lick of this cold weather you mainland Europeans are dealing with right now
Not every country is lucky enough to sit on a ridiculous amount of untapped, easily accessible, renewable energy
So it's not really something we can be incredibly *proud* of, per se
It's just a no-brainer for us to exploit the natural resources we're sitting on
It's a lot harder for Poland to go full on renewable, but when you do, it will also be much more of an achievement
Yeah, -5 °C is actually quite cold for Reykjavik
We don't have very cold winters, or very hot summers
I think most of the year we're at 10°C +/- 5°C.
Geothermal energy
We also produce quite a bit from hydropower

No, they had to tear one down last year to make space for farming

"Hey, don't you guys believe in elves
For Iceland it's:
"omg do u really believe in elves
"incest app"
I know it's the way to annoy Icelanders
How about calling them the Arabic Nazis
Then follow it up with the Armenian genocide, Balkan stuff and calling Ataturk their Hitler
That should do it
'Hey, don't you have an incest prevention app
Even worse, a German guy once told me that "Icelanders believe in elves". I do not believe in elves
He tried to argue with me
Because you're just so *ligeglad* about everything
Iceland also left out
Presumably because Denmark was left out, and we would be nothing without Denmark
Which annoys us
There's a party dwarf who lives on a fjord up in the north
He's a drug addict, I think
That is too specific and strangely accurate to be annoying
Not at all
Some are work dwarves, they're *bindindisdvergar* who never touch a drop of liquor or other mind-altering substance
The natural enemy of the party dwarf of the northern fjord
When will they make another goal
The moment they reach the current one, or in 2030
Surely the pope speaks good english
I just took the test [here] Hopefully Iceland will be included next time, I suspect we'll score high
I got 94%.
Atleast they are there :(
I really don't know, most people here are fluent in it so  we would probably score fairly high
You never annexed us, only occupied us
Otherwise we would probably not be free today, much harder to get freedom from annexation than occupation with promised freedom
Ah, makes sense, idk if the US would ever bother fully annexing us tho
If you fixed your healthcare and 2 party system situations I could maybe potentially (probably not tho) live with Iceland being a state

Nei hvað?
Alltaf gaman að sjá land vor fá athygli meðal evrópubúa, þótt að það sé í skoplegum tilgangi

yep it basically does
ég_irl = i_irl
mig_irl = me_irl
On that note, doesn't it make more sense for it to be i_irl
Nominativ
It's surprisingly big on the inside
Just for clarification, the institution itself is that old but the building in the photo was finished in 1881 :)
Þú ert ekki að fá athyglina sem þú verðskuldar
Ég can also be me
this is me = þetta er ég
Dat Swedish ting
Well, 'þing' only has the meaning 'assembly' in Icelandic
But isn't "I" nominativ
Nefnifall in Icelandic
Perhaps my English just sucks, but I've always used 'I' where I'd use 'ég' in Icelandic
I always use 'me' when I'd say 'mig' or 'mér' in Icelandic
[edit]
[Here] is an article on it
Yeah, I looked it up
They have entire articles on this
According to those articles if you go by strict grammar you say 'This is I'. That's how it used to be
But more and more people started saying 'This is me', to the point where it is much more common today
So it's just a case of the language changing in spite of the grammar
'This is I' is still grammatically correct, but in every day conversations, you're much more likely to hear 'This is me' these days
That's the only reason we're sort of forced to translate 'This is me' = "Þetta er ég". If their language hadn't changed in spite of the grammar, we'd be translating it as 'Þetta er mig' eða 'Þetta er mér', neither of which makes any sense in Icelandic
At least that's what I could gather after reading up on it a bit
[Edit]
Þetta er svona nokkurn veginn eins og þágufallssýki yrði allt í einu samþykkt sem málfræðilega rétt í íslensku
Það er basically það sem virðist hafa gerst í enskunni
Ég high
Yeah, good point
i_irl has a pretty bad ring to it, doesn't it
I found some articles on it
It seems using 'This is I' is grammatically correct, but using 'This is me' has become so common in every day speech that it is essentially accepted as well
That's so strange to me
Feels like they're using akkusativ or dativ where it shouldn't be used
Wonder how it wound up becoming the norm in common speech
Looks a bit funny
Yes, that actually does make sense to me
Although I must admit, you guys really should start speaking our language
We have been doing our best to preserve it for you guys for a very long time now
I was reading some Jämtish texts this morning, from almost 1000 years ago
They're incredibly similar to Icelandic, so I suggest you start there
When you're done, give us a call and we can start making plans on how to take over Sweden and Denmark
We need to make Scandinavia red, white and blue
> "This is I", or "It is I", is definitely an archaic expression
I wouldn't know how archaic it is
I just looked up some articles on it
They just say 'This is I' and 'It is I' is grammatically correct, but enough people say 'This is me' now for it to be the most common form and as such accepted
It has nothing to do with grammar, as very strictly speaking it's wrong as far as grammar goes
But that's not how languages work
They change over time
But I'm Icelandic
When it comes to preserving our language we take things to the extreme
So we don't have any exceptions like this when it comes to cases (to my knowledge)
So this definitely came as a surprise to me
People speaking wrong grammar is stamped out wherever possible over here
But it's much harder in a country of over 300 million people
So English will always be a much more fluid language
But yeah, 'this is me' and 'this is I' both seem to be perfectly acceptable, although in every day speech you might get strange looks if you say 'this is I'. That's what I took from what I read

This is no laughing matter, the president has disenfranchised many Icelanders with this, and effectively split our society
Vegans, vegetarians and others who like many fruits and vegetables on their pizzas, (pineapple in particular) now have nowhere to turn and thus prepare for civil war
This war of the anti-pineapple  factions vs
pineapple lovers has left no room for moderates who may sometimes order pineapple on their pizzas but not all the time because it's ok but you can do without it
Here Is a follow up he just posted to his official Facebook page:
>Yfirlýsing í stóra pítsumálinu - a statement on the pizza-controversy :)
>Mér finnst ananas góður, bara ekki á pítsu

Ég myndi ekki vilja gegna þessa embætti ef ég gæti sett lög sem bönnuðu það sem mér mislíkar
Ég myndi ekki vilja búa í þannig landi
Ég mæli með fiskmeti á pítsu
>I like pineapples, just not on pizza
I do not have the power to make laws which forbid people to put pineapples on their pizza
I am glad that I do not hold such power
Presidents should not have unlimited power
I would not want to hold this position if I could pass laws forbidding that which I don´t like
I would not want to live in such a country
For pizzas, I recommend seafood
He's joking, people have the legally protected right to ruin their pizza
I'm from Iceland and this guy just went from pretty good to not my president
Luckily his only power is signing bills or not, he's literally worse than Trump at this point
We're basically the same
Pítsa is best pizza
Yep, the president in Iceland is mostly a ceremonial role
His job is also to ensure that there is an active parliament
So He comes into play after elections or if the parliament majority breaks down
So when there is an active parliament majority running the show his job is mostly to shake hands and hold speaches
He also has the power to decline laws past by parliament in which case they will be sent to a public vote
It has only happened a couple of times in history and it would be an outrage if he did unless a significant part of the population were demanding it of him
It happened for example with the Icesave contracts where 20% of the population signed a petition urging him to decline

It's a stretch to include that incident IMO, since the connotation of school-shootings are with a firearm, not bows

So not really a stretch
Yes, I'm sorry it is a stretch, because of the connotation of school shooting and the map legend makes no attempt at explaining the definition of it
You can shoot rubber bands as well, if you want to have a strict definition of the word "shoot", in which case there's school shootings every day in every single school, all over the world - including Europe
This is an example of shoddy research, the guy who made the map, google'd "school shooting" and didn't read the article

Unless you are in Copenhagen, at Strøget, in H&M or in McDonalds
Then the chances of you bumping into an Icelander are ridiculously high
This is a joy Icelandic-speakers understand very well
We could trash talk you Danes all day long plus everybody else everywhere else
Good luck and here is your potato
Det er best
Sounds like kúkakápa would be said in Icelandic, which isn't a real word but means "a coat made of poo". My favourite Finnish word :D
I agree in principle, but the UK isn't exactly a bastion of free speech on the internet either
If anything they might have been the ones to push a law like this
I almost melted tbh, 14°C is just way too much
SummEr HAs aRRiveD eVEryWhere iN EUrOpe
Yea it was really hot today
It’s too damn hot
Fuck summer
It was fucking 22 degrees the other day in Reykjavík
I’m not gonna lie, I’m one of those “I wish winter would be an all year event” kinda guys
Oh we’d forget it ourself if we weren’t standing in it, I got to wake up for a shift in 2 hours and 45 minutes, but no way in hell I can sleep it’s too damn hot outside
Right
We’re in the middle of nowhere to live in the cold, not middle of the bloody Italy
14°C during the day is kind of normal during summers
Our heat record was beat in my village a few years ago, 30°C most jobs sent workers home cause it was too hot
I’ve always said, anything over 5 is excessive
It’s amongst the fastest and cheapest in Europe
We're just piggybacking on the cables you guys have put over the ocean to America
We strategically put our rock in the correct spot
> for a couple of shepherds
Hey, hey, that's just racist
.... There are also a half dozen fishermen, and they are *very* sick of being left out
I mean I don’t put on a coat until it reaches below -17 I guess you could say I find that cold
Icelandic weather is pretty consistent around the year (thank you gulf stream)
It generally swings between -5°C and 15°C under average conditions
26 in my home town tbh but only for like 2 hours then it started raining
The heat record of my town (Eskifjörður) is I think the country heat record which was 32°C if ur recall correctly and I remember I was 14 and had to work all day
I’ve been to morocco
It was lovely
Shorts time
You have to live here for 5 years first
But for those five years you have all the same rights as a citizen except for voting, so it probably won't bother you
It's warm
Time for a *double* portion of ice-cream
I was getting sick of the normal winter portions, finally time to get greedy
Greenland or Svalbard tbh
I mean there’s no extra heat bill for me, if it gets too cold I close the window tbh, but yeah it gets dark for like months
That’s the global warming for you, we see it here too, in the capital they barely even get snow
Like why did god make such a nice time to only put it at a 9 month period of time like why be so cruel
-2 to -5 is mine not gonna lie, but I also like it when you breathe and you feel the frost in your lungs
Now that’s an idea
But what if they send me to space instead
>Iceland cropped from the map AGAIN
YOU WILL NOT ERASE US

The language barrier doesn't stop everyone
Once an English speaker with a thick Indian accent tried calling and introducing himself as being " from my It department"
He was calling a landline on a farm in Iceland
So happy to be in Iceland right now
The weather that past week has been just perfect, 20C or so, sunny and just really really nice
Back to burning alive in about a week when I return to Norway though
I fear for the future
Same
We're good here thanks, please leave your oven temperatures over there
Say what you will, but until our geothermal thingamajigs make the country a steam bath we will remain the coolest of cats
Edit: flair missing, am Icelandic
feels good man
I feel like Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland are one unit
Estonia isn't a part of the nordic council even
Isn't lithuania slavic anyways
like poland just not as shitty
Looks like Central from fuulmetal alchemist
This photo is set to synthwave, in my mind's eye
We really, really need the same kind of law that we have for browsers and search engines, for app stores
The monopoly on application distribution is incredibly bad for the consumer and the developer
In Iceland:
"Check it out, he's learning Icelandic
"... why
"Because I wish to speak to the elves, too
This is my life
Most people are impressed with my progress since I speak it every day, and I'm super enthusiastic about it
Other people simply open the conversation with English (which should never be the case in my opinion) and even when I speak back in Icelandic for the entire conversation they will maintain English
This comes off as rude
It's like they don't actually want me to speak it for some reason
Oh well, I will not be deterred
Germans will happily change for anyone
They've proven that time and time again throughout history
Meanwhile Iceland lets all tourists, including tourists coming from high-risk areas, walk free into the country while Icelanders returning home from these areas have to go straight into quarantine
Let me be the first one on this thread to recognize the independence of Latvia
Congrats :)
Can't we just give you a mountain instead
Phew, good thing they removed the eagle, now no one can see who built it
