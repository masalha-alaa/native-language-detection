We are the only country in EU where the Sharia law is still legal
In Crete most if not all people have at least one kind of gun in their house (anything from a hunting rifle to the latest fully automatic rifle) and some time ago (maybe even now I have no idea) the rest are Vendettas where families (by families I mean a group of people that have the same surname) would go into all out war between each other for any kind of reason
I'm from Crete but I Grew up in Attica and my family used to be in a Vendetta when someone was operating my Great Grandfathers excavator and he rolled over and died and his family blamed my great grandpa and I don't know how that ended
Ah, the good ol' shaming the victim
It's a dominant mindset over here as well and it's disgusting
Ωπα κάτσε τι;
Crete is
scary
Like, really scary
I'm from Thessaloniki and we mainly solve problems by saying "χαλαρά" and then going for a beer
Explain to me why is this dark
Same in Greece, different punishments
I don't think that time serving the public or getting prepared for war is time stolen or wasted
Not who you replied to, but skipping military training doesn't land you in prison in Greece, except for periods of war
There are many smaller problems associated, though
For instance, if you are abroad you are only allowed to be in Greece for a maximum of 30 days/year, if you are skipping service
Also you can buy out your service when you are 33 for around 7000€.
None, why would i?
I would like for Greeks and Turks to live peacefully , but obliderating their country
No i wouldnt
Switzerland, just for the chaos of the lost money of pretty much everyone rich enough in this continent
Greece, we might as well become modern day Atlantis
A little useless place in southern europe like macedonia
No not really we wouldn't obliterate them lol, they're a bit too small
Yup, that's the point
There's not a trace of Atlantis either
It will be a myth that will last for generations
I had no idea he could actualy become the PM,thought it was a joke
Everyone's fekked, that's my reaction
After all this, I'm sitting here thinking "They still still have the ability to unilaterally recall article 50", but nope, everyone still wants to dig the brexit grave even deeper
I'm appalled by the fact that there was that whole "X amount of money going to the EU that could be funneled into the NHS" malarkey knowing how much EU funding the UK received
At least in Greece there are signs pointing out that X project was funded in part by the EU
Nothing of the sort in the UK as far as I recall, there's a huge lack of education regarding that
I'm freakin' pissed with Greece's lack of proper management of EU development funds, let alone the fact that the UK has also been heavily funded, but somehow skewed a large portion of public opinion into thinking that the EU is some kind of oppressive regime
Do I have to remind people that this Social and Economic union is probably one of the main reasons this continent hasn't wrecked itself again since the end of the 2nd World War
He looks like someone doing a bad impression of Trump
I feel honored to do so as well
When it comes to nationalism, and even patriotism to an extent, I want nothing to do with it
I've never been a fervent supporter of banners, and I self-criticize more than I boast, but when it comes to the institution that is the European Union, all bets are off
There are always problems when it comes to maintaining this union among sovereign states
There are compromises, sluggish bureaucracy, economic issues, social issues, you name it, but the truth is, we've also enjoyed long-term prosperity and peace under it, and I want nobody badmouthing my EU
As is the case with all member states
It's just large scale taxation
You chip in according to your GDP and you get funding for projects, infrastructure and so on
That was the whole deal, no one weighed the benefits when it came to the whole "NHS bus" thing
Sure, you chip in X million according to your GDP, but you're also eligible for funding, and there was lots of it
It was never free money, but it's also not a disproportionate amount compared to the privileges received
Basically all of our ancient or medieval history which is full of civil wars and back-stabbing
Or literally during our independence war
Yeah that's right, after 400 years of Ottoman occupation, we fought a civil war in the middle of our independence war against them
Right now in history I'd say is one of the biggest bruh moments fot Greece
1897 greco-turkish war (the unlucky war) was quite a big bruh momentum, as it wasnt intended, and we got defeated pretty hard
1921, at one moment Greece has territories in Turkey including Constantinople, and in the next the Allies in WW1 switch sides helping Turkey re take all of their land in minor asia back kicking out the Greeks in the process
I am sure it was unavoidable, and could have ended better for Greece
I feel like I often get confused about which phrases make sense in English and which in Greek, sometimes saying a string of words that has absolutely no meaning in Greek
Yeah it happens but when it comes to numbers I always read the number in greek in my head and sometimes even mumble it out while reading an English text or speaking English
I did a few years ago but I've become more social the past few years so I use my native language more
No offence but the German grammar doesn't sound all that better either
I have the stereotypical Greek accent mixed with a slight attempt at pronouncing some things right and it leads to an abomination of an accent
I despise my accent deeply but I probably will never do anything to fix it
I find it funny and it's used as a joke a lot
I was once told by someone it sounds Arabic, I haven't spoken to that person ever since
I think it's mire than good compared to other Greeks, but I want to improve it a bit
I used to hate it but now I kinda like it, it sounds unique but also depends on who is speaking
I feel that most greeks hate it and that's why I feel a bit insecure about it
I used to have a pretty good accent although I believe I sounded more American than British, however lately I haven't gotten many chances to have long conversations in English, especially with people who's mother tongue is English thus my pronunciation took a hit
My fluency in English also tanked a bit
My accent is fine, everyone I've met understands it
Generally, the Greek accent is a heavy one so I can tell from miles that a person is Greek
Unfortunately, if one has a good English accent, they get mocked by fellow Greeks because they put effort, and I hate this
I basically have to switch to a shitty Greek accent when speaking English every time another Greek is present
It'd be interesting to see if this phenomenon appears in other countries too
I actually hate the greek accent, but the thing is that I have a completely american accent naturally, it is indistinguishable from an american accent and many people think I'm from the USA
But the funny thing is that foreign people seem to really like it when I speak with a greek accent, so I may or may not purposely talk with a greek accent most of the time now because foreigners find it "exotic" or what they call it
lmao
Sometimes I do
Like most Greeks, I was taught British English, used the Greek accent though at some point I started trying to make it sound smoother (but apparently it sounds fake to most non-Greeks), and lots of times I'll attempt to do an American accent to get Google voice commands to work properly
I've been told that my standard Greek accent sounds better, but sometimes I can't shake the uneasiness when it starts sounding like a port barker (those yelling "rooms to let" when you get off a ferry in most Greek islands)
I always thought it sounded very bad and not understandable but I've been complimented on it before, although I really can't understand what's nice about it lol
[sounds like this]
i suppose it's because we are given a cheap android phone when we're teens and so switching os is pretty inconvenient and takes too long to get a hold of
in my case i was given a small lg and because i had to buy the rest of my phones myself i went with cheap phones that are just as good, my Xiaomi redmi 6
This is how I always see it
Android is cheaper, it does the job done
I also don't want to be robbed or killed for a several hundred euros iphone
And I hate that there is exclusivity on iphones
It's like annoying Adobe
And guess what, everyone switches to Affinity because of that
I think iphones will become like that
People will start thinking if they really need it or not
Chances are, they don't. And security wise it's equally shit
Well the top iPhone right now costs as much as two months of salaries you could say buy an iPhone 4-6 but outside of their chipset and maybe camera everything else is bad and outdated, the second reason is that most people never joined the cult of apple like America has with its walled ecosystem
Athens
It's dirty, it's impossible to live there, there's no green, if you see the city from a satellite or from a plane while you're flying, it's like a motherboard of a computer
It's just a wasted potential, it could be much better
Thessaloniki, but it is not shame, more like mild annoyance
It is the only really big city of the country except for Athens, but still much smaller than Athens
Most of Thessaloniki citizens like complaining about how all the infrastracture goes to Athens and they are neglected blah blah
They are way more conservative than Athens, more religious on average and have a very annoying type of localism
Now, about regions but not cities, the souther tip of Peloponnese (Mani) and big part of Crete are a disgrace, they like preserving macho stereotypes as "traditions", they like guns, they think that driving drunk is "manly" and generally they are some decades behing in mentality
Well actually it depends on which suburb you live in
The center is alright I guess (and by Center I mean the very center like syntagma and acropolis)
Then the northern suburbs are pretty nice (more greenery and overall richer) and the south suburbs are nice too
The west suburbs and the rest of the center are well known to be a shit hole tho
Why are you ashamed of Aspropyrgos
I’m from there and it’s fine if you don’t pay attention to the ‘news’ too much lol
Patras does not have a weird reputation, it is mostly known for the carnival
Pyrgos is gypsy capital of Greece, and yup, one of the worst cities
If you mean Glifada, well, I speak about regular people
I have lived and by live, I mean one month plus in Marousi which is considered a very good area by Athens standards, but I just couldn't stand it
I am from Crete and I have lived in Heraklion, Chania and Thessaloniki, all good
Athens is a nightmare
First of all, you can't breathe if you come from a rural area due to the pollution
When I had been studying in Chania, students from Athens were coming and they were getting dizzy by the oxygen
Pretty much agree, but Heraklion
Really
I've never visited a shittier city in terms of traffic and driving behavior, overall even more chaotic than Athens
It's lesser known because of the nice stuff going on: nature, beaches, historic places, etc
But, hell, I would rather live in the shithole called Athens rather than in Heraklion
I can’t disagree with that
We are, but for obvious reasons that I’m not going to explain here in detail
This place was different from other ones, people were different, kids grew up differently and therefore shaped a very different and distinct attitude which people from other areas do not like or afraid of in many ways and I can’t blame them
Just stop listening to the news about this place haha
My go to is "I was waiting hours for the bus"" or "the traffic was horrible" which is true for the city I live in
Especially, the public transportation part is abysmal
In School we say "the bus was late again" Because busses here are almost never on time
Or just "my alarm didn't go off"
Idk bout Greece in general but in Thessaloniki we say that the metro was late
It's been under construction since 1985
South europe unite
The cool guy that people like to hang around with but everyone kinda wants them to get fired
Unemployed
Pretty sure greece would be that co-worker who's always out of money and asks you to lend them 100€ even though he owns so much that if he ever paid you back you would be able buy a house in NYC and a jet but you reluctantly give him what he asks for because he gave you an answer during a test in third grade and you own him one
Of course he will never pay you back
*Wtf does this dude do with money and he's always out anyway
Does he eat it
Does he plant it and wait for a money tree to grow
Who knows
Also, everyone knows he got the job because his father's cousin's wife's sister-in-law knows (and occasional sleeps with) the boss
Greece - The guy who has been in the corner since always, but no one knows what exactly his job is
We would be the unemployed guy outside the office's building
Unemployed
Or you would start a fight in the building and then point the finger at the German ;)
This guy works here
First time I see him
Did you describe my life
Well that explains it
Imperial measurement system
For a whole month I had to google convert everything to metric
A year later, I joined the military and most American Vehicles in our army were are using imperial measurement system and to this day this is something that pisses me off
I have to say
Never been to America but damn, African-Americans are *insanely* religious (from what I see on YT)
ikr
I've never been to the US but I know that the standard coffee there is drip coffee, and hell, I would need seven cups a day to keep awake if I could only drink drip coffee

EVERYWHERE
Greeks and Danes seem to do that as well for some reason
Greece: the horrible and disgraceful Moria refugee camp is still there
People say they care about the refugees, but nobody does anything to close the place down
Normalizing restrictions of personal freedoms for the sake of public health
This should not happen
People starting to think that touching and social contacts are dangerous and bad
I do not want Europe to become Korea and Taiwan, with people going outside with masks
And I thought we were corrupted
I'm Greek  so basically every single one,
Names like Pericles, Ares, Hera and ancient Greek names in general are still in use today
Yes, YES
When I'm travelling abroad and suddenly overhear someone else speak Greek I feel like my mind glitches
44% of individual income goes to taxes
First in motorcycle fatal accidents rate in EU
3% of Greeks are in danger of poverty
You get pension when you are 67 yo
Greeks work more hours than every other European
80% of the country is mountainous
1/3 of the population lives in Athens
The deepest point in the Mediterranean is in Calypso Deep, south-west of Pylos
There is a desert on the island of Lemnos
The stripes of the flag are the same number as the syllables of "ελευθερία ή θάνατος" (=liberty or death), which was the motto of the 1821 Greek Revolution
Portugal and orange may look similar in greek but they are not synonymous
Does the first one refer to SU
For example, VAT is 24% on almost everything
There is variation for higher and lower classes but the 44% is an average
It's normal for a state that has significant social welfare and offers high quality public services, like public safety (police), public transport, etc
That's the case for Netherlands or Sweden, not for Greece
At least you get something back
Ours mostly service loan interests
The most buffling one I saw recently was that people in a city where a new 5G Network was installed gathered signatures to remove it because allegedly it was a plot by Europeans to turn them infertile
I like how 5G can barely pass through tree leaves yet people think it can cause serious issues
slow the much oil, is very easy to speak with greek way
Wanker mine, if think that you can work me, are mistaken

Interesting exercise
Will use this the opportunity for speaking for[about] the cats my
Have two cats
The one is mother of other
Them love much
But they not loving [each other]
Indeed, hating [each other]
More particular, the daughter hates the mother hers
When her see, [at] her glare
With hatred
Like to want to her kill
If the mother approaches, the daughter meows aggressively
The mother scared, freezes, looks with straight-[wide]open eyes, very cute, and flees
Often, hide under from furniture for to [be] saved, because the daughter runs to her hunt, and if her catch, [I] hear screaming meows [of] attack and noises [of] fight
[I] run for to stop [them], but fighting so intensely, that [I] end up with scratches everywhere
Don't know how to them make to become friends
Accept advice, thank from the before
At the down down of the write, who cares
σιγα τον πολυελαιο

Well we are so awful in football in the last years so it's not like we will even take part there anyway so
I mean, we arent americans, most ultras/hools here actually help their team mire then cause trouble
Well this is the dillhema that always arises in this context for example in the cheap clothing discussion
My take on this is that the alternative often is something very very simple in contrast to the original boycotting idea
I would say that to me it just seems to be a poor excuse to say that sharing awareness is enough
It is only there to make people think that something is being done and that it is enough
If an alternative is to be made it should be it should be as difficult, important and expressive as the boycott
Maybe fine Qatar for it's perversion of such a sporting event
Yes and if the US introduces visas for all EU citizens that's perfectly fine
US's current stance completely undermines EU integrity
Oh boi that's a question with an neverending answer but to keep things shorts
Let's just say founding SYRIZA party
His 2015 shenanigans damaged even more Greece's reputation
People were joking about that for many years lmao

Every little thing is unthinkable in our lock down
Isolation is not possible in Greek life
Having no friends over
Not eating or drinking until dawn on a Saturday night
Not being able to go to the cinemas or the theater
STANDING IN QUEUES WITH 2M DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE OTHER MUMBLING GREEK
WAITING PATIENTLY TO ENTER IN SUPER MARKETS IN TEAMS OF 10 PEOPLE EACH TIME
HAVING TO FOLLOW A SPECIFIC SET OF RULES BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S HEALTH WILL SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL
DID I MENTION QUEUES
I am not panicking, you are
In all seriousness, even bouzoukia and clubs are closed
Public beaches and ski resorts are closed
Even our Easter is canceled
The fun part is that, my age group (35) and younger has adopted quite well, with all the above
Hell brakes loose when there are older people involved, like 55 and above
The main reason is that they are not adapt at technology as we are and they feel trapped
NOTE: There are still tourists walking around Athens, expecting to see the Parthenon and the museums
And good luck to them, because the closest they will get to them is through the official websites and Google maps view
Seriously, it's for the best
Europe needs to build a vast network of high speed railways, just like China is doing
Greece is too far away from most of europe and sadly too insignificant financially to justify such an investment, especially for passenger trains
The only way this would work is Greece developing as a logistics hub connecting Europe to Africa and Asia
I really love trains and they are a very good alternative to regional aviation, but this scenario is kinda farfetched
I know, it would be great but Greece doesn't seem to be the center of attention when it comes to investments, nor do we have a state that favours them (bureaucracy etc
We could always do better, plus an investment on land has to create jobs mostly for the locals, which is a great thing for Greece
The revival of south-east Europe doesn't seem to be Germany's priority so it could prove really difficult to go through with a big plan
Hope dies last though
Well here in Greece we see them every now and Again, we Also  see about the syrian refugees and such fairly often
I don't really see them anymore (but then again I have stopped watching Greek tv) but I did grow up in the 90s with the stereotype of poor Africa/starving children
Unicef really bombarded us with it and I'd usually buy at least one unicef notebook every year "to help the African children" which would be double the price of a normal notebook and they'd hand them out at schools
Our landlord was a known prick but when he died we found out he was giving a ton of money every month to Unicef when he didn't really have much
I had a Greek-Somali schoolmate and through her I got to know the variety of Africa
She'll tell me crazy stories and how mangoes and bananas taste nothing like the shit we have here
She'd show us videos of her time in a Greek military camp in Somalia before she'd come to live here, and it was an eye opener
Nowadays I think it's ActionAid that advertises more
People would rather support programs were you give enough money for a village in Africa to built a well or some sort of irrigation system rather than giving them cookies with multivitamins etc
African nations have started gaining tech knowledge and there are businesses and investments going
Apart from some migrant camps and political instability we don't see the image of a starving child as much
Well "simp" Seems the most fitting for me
Cause in Greek it's Μουνόδουλος (Mounódoulos) which literally translates to "pussy slave" which is way different attitude from plain "simp
Oh I haven't heard of that one but by its definition I can tell you Μουνόδουλος is a combination of pussywhipped and simp
I think it was used like normie or something I'm not sure
I named my black cat Tod because Google Translate said it means death in German, but it sounds like a normal pet name
Aww, they delivered it to my door every September
Wise move though, we have a planet’s ecosystem to save
That's great news
I receive 2 in the mail (everyone in my neighbourhood does, I can't explain why)
I do occasionally scour through them but whenever I actually need something, it's their site that I'll use-much easier
What winter
Currently wearing flip flops right now
Yes and no
Some people still love bringing up WW2 in every chance, but it became more popular because of the austerity that was seen as imposed by Germany
Greek people really hate being patronized and dictated what to do and not to do, so the anti-German sentiment skyrocketed and the Nazi parallels were unavoidable
But it is mostly because Nazism is a convenient easy parallel for Germany, more than anything else, not because they really believe that nowadays Germany has anything to do with that
I wouldn't say anti German people since there's a German village 10 minutes away from my village and we get along pretty well, but I would definitely say anti German government due to the fact that all 3 economic adjustment programs were made by Germans and Merkel imposed them, so as you can imagine, almost no one likes Merkel, especially when she supported Erdoğan
Now, about nazis etc
I would say only the old people who lived through it
The rest not that much
Yeah, it kinda is still and while i understand where it stems from it's a bit too much
I personally have encountered too many times anti-german people
Sometimes people even say things they made up straight from their mind
Like I get it
We don't like Germany from a historical point of view but it gets on my nerves
I was born and raised in Germany and people are most of the time ignorant of the modern time Germany
They really think things like "they are cold people", " they are racists", "they are suppressing us",  "their language is unpleasant, stiff and brutal" just to say a few common things
And whenever I say something about Germany or being born in Germany some people have this look in there face like this is very unpleasant for them, so to speak
They don't really like Germany at all here
In general, Germans here are regarded as rule-abiding citizens, hard-working if a bit stiff and humourless
Germany is a widely used example to provide contrast to the greek tendency to view laws as guidelines rather than actual rules
Due to the current economic crisis, which begun about 10 years ago, many people view northern Europeans negatively, because they are the creditors, but German get a special acknowledgement here, mainly by morons who think Germany owes us reparations for WWII
Older people tend to view Germany more positively too, because many of them or members of their families were able to migrate there and work after Greece tore itself up in the civil war in '45
I myself have a great-aunt who lived in Germany for 40 years
Nah, but anti- German sentiment is strong in small villages that suffered the atrocities of the Nazi
People in this villages are mostly boomers
There is a general dislike because of WWII mainly, but there are other factors that contribute as well
From personal experience Germans are stereotyped as rude, boring and that they have a superiority complex
Also another reason is their treatment of Greeks (again, comes from people's experiences)
I don't know a single Greek that doesn't have a relative that hasn't faced racism in Germany and German tourists are seen as the most disrespectful (although that could be confirmation bias, I've noticed it as well)
That's not to say that Germans are bad people and I have anything against them, the newer generations tend to be more indifferent/neutral to German people as well and the dislike is towards the government and of course, the Germans of the 1930s-1940s.
Yes it is
Plenty of people will now say that they're above and beyond it but then Germany goes and does something new that we dislike and it all comes back
It can't be helped if they always oppose us in many different things
If you've been to greece you'll know that most people are kind towards you if you engage them
However distrust towards Germany is deeply rooted in the general discourse
I would argue that this is natural when most of us have been brought up on horrific stories of starvation, slaughtering of families or even entire villages that our parents and grandparents experienced
As a result even the most reasonable greek harbours some prejudice against Germans and especially the German government
Yes
We even have a curse word for people who agree with Germany politically: germanotsolias
Hard to translate, but sort of Greek guard of Germans
Propably from polonisation during the time of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth
I never faced racism in Germany and I rly doubt this has anything to do with the feelings of Greeks towards Germans
Also, at least in my experience, British tourists get more negative attention than the German ones
This is just a popular term for the security batallions of the 1940s.
Hard to say
It is not going downwards, it has pretty much stagnated, with salaries, taxes etc remaining more or less the same the last years
But this is not good the way Greek people see it, we have the Purchasing Power of former Eastern Block countries right now
it has stabilized in a quite low point
That has been exactly our behaviour through the last decade (and more or less before, too)
A malfunctioning, highly corrupted State, a (declining) majority of citizens with no respect for the law, an unbelievably socialistic (almost communistic) financial system with heavy taxation and a gargantuan public sector that offers services of the poorest quality
So, how do we find the money for all that shit, without blaming ourselves
State + media: Oh, it's the Germans, they hate our sun and our history, they want to bankrupt us
A month ago I learnt Nokia is finnish and not japanese
I thought for a long time that Porsche was Italian .
Nokia sounds pretty japanese
I was researching bell labs history
Hey I noticed your username is Greek
I have to ask what's the story behind it, if you want to share
It depends on where you live
Usually coastal areas or islands don't have that good of a quality water and buy bottled
Then again further into the mainland its totally fine, but even there in some cases as the guys from Italy mentioned it may have too much chlorine to the point you can taste it, averting people from consuming it
As long as there's a filter, we'll drink the tap water no problem
Without a filter I'd probably go with bottled water
Also in a suburb of Attica
I think it's more as a precaution from what I've noticed with others who do the same
All the time
Sometimes there's no corresponding word(s) in Greek
I truly hate it when this happens
British Empire reduced to the size of Massachusetts but they left an enormous linguistic footprint in the world
Quite often unfortunately
And sometimes I don't remember a word in either my native language or English, which is even more annoying
Way more than often
Mostly because 100% of my entertainment is in English
yup it happens quite a lot
i never browse the Greek internet so in the day i use english almost as much as Greek especially now that we're in quarantine again
too often, i had to google translate words from english to greek, because i forgot the word, too many times
my essays in english were really good too but in greek, they were like a 10 year old wrote them
I honestly feel like it literally happens as often as the opposite, it has become a 50/50 split
Sometimes that, sometimes I may have learnt how to say something in English but Greek is more readily available in my mind
That and the awkward moment of having to describe some item or tool/utensil in one or the other language
If you're gonna eat souvlaki, for the love of God, eat it wrapped as it is, just hold it and bite it, don't open it up and use a fork and a knife
It's not even that serious, but still hurts our soul
Nothing really, except maybe some politics, regarding Alexander the Great, kastellorizo and calling us lazy for example
Never call someone's bullshit or never go against someone's beliefs, here people will defend their opinion like it's their home even if proven wrong
Same here lol
I mean, yeah there are many strong-headed people over here and if they feel attacked they're fast to get ultra defensive and attack back, but I'm pretty sure there are also many people who are willing to have civilized conversations lol
"we, on the contrary, shall fight for North Macedonia, and our hearts will be in it" Alexandreski Greatovic
I have to agree, while a super rare occurrence, there are people that will admit that they are wrong in a conversation or make a normal mature conversation
We were nearly always in the bottom in Jeux Sans Frontieres
Greece finished in the last place at 2008 Euro Championship
It's funny because Greece won the the previous Euro (2004)
I loved that show
That's the only way EU countries should interact with each other
>Jeux Sans Frontieres
What the hell is that
i dont think we should
The only time that happens to me is when me and a group of friends happen to play against Turkish people on rocket league and that once friend of the group decides to get all toxic and nobody knows if they're being serious or not
I don't know how Germans and Italians feel but when we Greeks talk about "the war", we swell with pride
Our ancestors, soldiers and civilians both fought bravely to defend our land and however they have suffered, we feel very proud of them
Same goes for the heroes of the first world war, the Balkan wars, the revolution, and everything else, we have nothing to be ashamed for
well aside from the balkans not that often
i mean if a German were to tell me their father or grandfather carried out the mass killings in Crete i would get kinda aggressive as my grandfather barely got out alive and i loved him with all my heart
If an italian were to tell me their grandfather fought us in ww2 i would maybe tease them a bit but that's all
all of that without including the balkans obviously
can confirm
Honestly, I don't really get it
I'm a total pacifist and I can vibe with just about everyone, even laugh at the past (or even present) conflicts between our countries
I don't get why someone would attack someone else for something as insignificant as being born a few kilometres farther away (and still literally having the same culture)
Of course every war is a disgrace, especially among Greeks and Italians that we have such a tight bond since ancient times
But what's the point saying that when we didn't have a choice
In Greece we are proud of our ancestors standing up to invaders, whoever these were
If by that you mean the Byzantines, then yes
Hell we consider Roman history our DLC
Yes, we do, we consider Byzantium the predecessor of Greece
Not necessarily, he was fond of the Germans but he was 100% aligned with the British, as they were the reason his government was formed in the first place
Although he was a dictator and people blindly praising him are uneducated
To have shame about something you need to know about it
I, being myself a Greek, I can tell you with confidence that we are very proud of our history, yet ignorant for the most part of it
Our school history books refer to that emperor as the Bulgarian killer (Bulgaroktonos), but I can't remember feeling ashamed of our ancestors regarding to the context of that
I was  young when we learnt about it in school, so I might need to re-educate myself on that matter
Something that happened centuries ago, is too deeply buried in the past to make us feel any shame
Oh yeah, I was never that person myself
I'm just saying that the average Greek will not know details about the event
i'd say the climate produces more warm and happy people but i don't know at the same time
here in Greece people party and get drunk once a week and everyone smokes from a young a young age and our life expectancy is 82
30 as of 2020
It's the diet
Colder countries consume more meat and fat-heavy diets, whereas mediterranean countries have some of the most healthy and balanced diets
>Steps begin when you are from some rural parts in the south east where they are very religious and closed-minded
I think that this is happening in most of the world though
The fact that it's only the southeast part sounds pretty good from my perspective
>The “LGBT ideology”
So, I have a friend who is kind of right wing, but I wouldn't say homophobic as far as I have seen
She has told me that the people in general are okay with the homosexuals, but the LGBT movement started crossing the line with the parades with some weird wood-paper statues of Holy Mary and Jesus painted rainbow and making them seem like clowns and then letting them out of the churches
Also, she told me that some people have seen what's happening in the US with the trans kids and they are afraid that if they give the LGBT movement a bit of space, then it will demand more
It is legal to change it at 15, but there's a with therapist and huge paperwork
In the US though, there are 3 years old trans kids which is seriously extreme
The fact that we are slow on everything benefits us sometimes
There is a compilation video of greek being spoken in different tv series or movies
It was the funniest shit ever
Somewhere I couldn't even understand what they were saying
The funniest one was from Xena the Princess warrior where Gabrielle (I think that's her name) was saying kalimera kalispera and then you hear kalinoches, as if they tried to merge kalimera and buenas noches lmao
Also, every time I hear russian I cringe a little bit hahaha, especially when the actor is a side character
Just hire a russian speaking actor
Other comments have already mentioned it below but we have fun with it
There is a really funny video compilation of attempts of hollywood to speak greek
Most is some mystic shit with ancient gods and titans and whatever
I will say this and hopefully nobody takes offense as I'm sure it goes the other way round
I find that many american actors have hilarious accents when it comes to speaking other languages, moreso than other nationalities, especially when they speak spanish
Something like Ow-Lah
Comoh ey-stas
So this always gives room for some giggles
It's just hilarious and most of the time, if they speak Greek randomly, I won't understand it immediately because they butcher it
I usually go:
"What did he/she say
Oh that was in Greek
Oh, ok
[This is the video .]
As mentioned the first 2 minutes from Xena is the best part . I think that someone asked the crew if they know any Greek words and put them randomly in this scene totally out of context .
I couldn't stop laughing at while watching the video with friends, and it still gets me every time
Ευχαριστω παρά πολυ
Ετσι κι ετσι
Γεια σου καλημερα
ΓειΑ σου καληνΥχτα
ΓΕΙΑ ΣΟΥ καληnotches
Ψοφαω καθε. Φορα.
Το βίντεο είχε part 2 και 3, όπου σε κάποια φάση από το GTA IV ένας npc λέει "I am a stupid malaka, please don't kill me" πεθαναααα
We have political parties youths acting inside the universities
Very often they decide that in order to protest about something they do not like (from a change in the studies programme up to a new law or
the war in Syria - no I am not kidding) they propose to the student body to "take over the building".
They call a "gathering" of all the students of the faculty, and in a proceeding involving speeches, shouting, arguing, booing etc that usually lasts hours they proceed to a vote on whether their proposal will pass or not (you can imagine how few people actually have nothing better to do than compete in this farce for hours)
"Taking over" the building ( I do not know how to express it in English better) means that they forbid any professor, PhD, cleaner, technician, secretary etc to enter, all academic procedures are halted
Until recently the police was banned by law from entering universities
But even now that the law changed they very rarely enter to stop this kind of situation unless it escalates in more serious crimes (like drug dealing, storing clubs and makeshift weapons, sheltering illegal immigrants etc) because it has been normalised through the years in the Greek society as a normal situation
Find me another European country that this sort of thing happens !!
plate smashing
Happy cake day
If they were doing 1/10 of what they do in Greece in the UK or Germany, they would have been arrested and suspended from the university, believe me
Also today they did that in schools all around Greece
Even in middle schools and high schools
Usually that's just an excuse to not have lessons in school
Καλά Χριστούγεννα!
Άγγλος στα ραντεβού του/Ágglos sta rantevoú tou: Punctual as an Englishman
Το παίζει Σουηδός/To paízei Souidós: He acts like a Swede, because Swedes in older decades, pre mobile internet, never bothered to learn anything about the place they visited, just went there and somehow expected everything to work out
Κάνει τον κινέζο/Kánei ton kinézo: He tries to pass as inconspicuous, to avoid trouble, like a stereotype about the Chinese says
Του είπε μερικά "γαλλικά"/Tou eípe meriká "galliká": He cursed/trash talked at the other person
Probably because prior to English, French was the dominant foreign language most Greeks would learn, usually those of higher status and wealth
So while French was the language of the aristocrats, "French"(with the quotes) refers to the complete opposite, ie cursing like a dock worker, a truck driver or whatever other professions have cursing at the ready
Αμερικανάκι/Amerikanáki: Refers to the gullible/dumb American stereotype, because back during the time of the brothels and cabarets of Troumba in Pireas, the American sailors on shore leave would be swindled by translators that acted like barkers for cabarets and brothels, which in turn would promptly relieve them of their money
The sailors would also sell small or pocket fm radios to the locals, which the locals thought they'd fooled them but the Americans usually bought those duty free, so they'd finance their night out with no hassle and sometimes with a profit
- Be an Englishman: be punctual
- Speaking Chinese: it's all Greek to me
- Scottish shower: something good followed by something bad and vice versa
Probably not a common phrase, but when me and my dad are sailing in the summer he says "Let's do some Danish sailing" jokingly
Meaning to sail a sailingboat while also "helping" to boost the speed using the motors at the same time
It is more of an inside joke than an actual used phrase though
Αρμένικη βίζιτα - armeniki visita - armenian visit
We say this for visitors who stay longer than expected and won't leave
"Οι Γερμανοί είναι φίλοι μας" (Í germaní íne fíli más)
It means "the Germans are our friends" As a reference to traitors in ww2 and it's used when someone snitches on you
Its a quote from an old movie about crete in ww2
Exact same in Greece (but in Greek, lol)
Orban is establishing an illiberal state for many years and noone did anything about it
Dictatorships are not always established by military coup nowadays
Erdogan was voted in perfectly democratically the first time
When all the signs are there that the guy tries to get even more and more power, don't have a shocked Pikachu face when he finally does it
PiS goals in Poland are the same, step by step
It seems some former communist block countries value the welfare of the economy more than their personal freedom and democratic rights, and big part of population is happy to live in an illiberal state if they have connected it with a better economy
Illiberal democracy is closer to authoritorianism than to Liberal Democracy
It just needs a chance to make the transition
The chance was the virus for Orban
And the problem is that it is a good chance
In many countries there are undemocratic measures taken, in Slovenia the police may get too much power, in Cyprus they want to monitor sick people with prisoners bracelets
Europe is happily giving up personal freedoms and normalizing surveillance and giving more power to the state over them for the sake of a sense of security
EU should get some spine and enforce strict measures for breaches of democracy and oppressing personal freedoms
Starting with Hungary, but only starting there
Nothing is worth going down an illiberal path
Are Hungarians in general supporting these measures ?
Edit: I'm talking about Orban's new powers
There is a video of Boris Johnson reciting the Iliad
He is using erasmian pronunciation, which is widely used abroad in the teaching of ancient Greek
I couldn't make a single word of it, save for the names
One time I was talking to an American study abroad student and he asked me how you say "thank you" in Greek
I told him, and when he tried to repeat it back he sounded like a cat trying to spit out a hairball
I was laughing for a solid few minutes
Other than that, in the second season of the Umbrella Academy, one character screams to another a very well known line from the Oddysey in ancient Greek, which I had to watch about 7 times to understand
His pronunciation was abysmal
Every Cypriot/Greek-Cypriot tv serial and Whenever i hear the Cretan dialect
as a bilingual it happens when i don't expect to hear my own language and i manage to identify a word and feel dumb
Had a client speak to me in a very village accent and in our 2 minute conversation I understood like 30% of what he was saying
Happens all the time when Greek Cypriots are speaking to each other and us mainland Greeks are listening
If you pay enough attention in school you can make some out
The words are not the problem, the syntax is
But you can definitely get the gist of it, even if you're long gone from school
It's not so much the contents but rather the accent
The erasmian accent, despite Erasmus' valiant efforts, is still largely a way for *foreigners* to pronounce ancient Greek, since it ignores elements that survive until today, while the reconstructed ancient accent is easier for Greeks to pronounce instead
The ancient Greek line as well
The Olga Foroga scene was amazing tho
In Greece, when I was going to school, people were telling that if you don't study, you will end up a garbage man
Meanwhile, with the recent garbage men strikes, you need to know someone from above in order to become one
They get paid more than teachers nowadays
I have an environmental engineering degree, but I seriously think of applying
Hmm but that applies even if you study enough and get your degrees
Sad but true
Yeah, these kinds of protogenic jobs are paid better now than the degree jobs
It was a good strategy until the 90s, but then the world filled with educated people who are looking for a job in their field while the quantity need of essential workers is bigger than the degree jobs
Not about Greece itself, but rather about our folklore; I have many times corrected people who are mythtaken about our mythology (Atlas, Medusa, the sun god, Persephone, etc)
I remember someone claiming Ares raped his cousin
like wtf
Had to explain to a couple of American pensioners while they vacated in Delphi, that our troubles weren't *"created by communism post WWII, when we were parts of the Warsaw pact and occupied by Russians".*
A french guy (in France) once asked me what language do we speak in Greece
I replied "Turkish".
We aren’t homeless with no internet connection
Wait till they find about Kratos
o mai god
The fact that we have a deity for every little obscure thing makes me insanely proud
Yeah but no matter what version of the family tree you look at, Ares does not have any rape or dubious consent myths
Like, none at all
>  did Leda lay an egg
Of course not
She laid *two* eggs
It depends on the tradition; first of all, Leda did not have twins, she had quadruplets, or two sets of twins
Those were Helen, Clytemnestra, Polydeuces and Castor
Helen is always the daughter of Zeus, and Clytemnestra the daughter of Tyndareus, Leda's mortal husband
With Castor and Polydeuces, things are more complicated
Some sources say they're both mortal, some they're both divine
If only one is divine, it's always Polydeuces
Which are the sets of twins is another debate; some say the kids were segregated in the eggs according to gender, so the twins are Helen-Clytemnestra and Castor-Polydeuces
Other say they're according to parentage, making the twins Helen-Polydeuces and Castor-Clytemnestra
At any point, Polydeuces and Castor are always called twins (though they're technically half-brothers), while Helen is Poly's only full-sibling
For context: The Greek word for "elevator" is "ασανσέρ" which is basically a phonetic transcription of French "ascenseur"
I've seen "ασανσέρ" translated to English as "asanser" on a sign
In greek the word "παϊδάκια" translates to "ribs" while the word "παιδάκια" translates to "children". So you imagine how hilarious it seems when a restaurant's menu says that it serves "children".
Bougatsa, which is a type of pastry that's usually filled with cream, translated as cream pie
[Does this count ?] Not really a translation
It'll have to be a listing on an e-shop for a children's Lalaloopsy backpack
Apparently the original material must have used something along the lines of "Lalaloopsy school backpack with kitty pattern". Someone in that e-shop decided that google translate alone was enough for the Greek translation and the listing came out as "Σχολή σακίδιο Lalaloopsy κούκλα μοτίβο με το μουνί", or  "Scholí sakídio Lalaloopsy koúkla motívo me to mouní", mouní being Greek sex slang for vagina
Please no use the asanser for more of 4 persons
Get a cream pie from your local bakery
I second your complaint
We got "Last exit: Rita Hayworth".
Well, that's dope
Hope it's a big step towards the better
Our islands, at least some of them are a free for all for tourists, mostly English, to get black out drunk and do stupid things
I don't mind it, in fact it can be a lot of fun when you're younger, I would just prefer if they weren't violent
Then again when the tourists fight they are so drunk they're not really a danger to anyone but themselves
Mostly by banning certain travel agencies and single Brits
For a while, UK travel agencies would book (mostly low income) groups of Brits, they'd arrive at Malia, got themselves drunk as heck, had sex on the street etc
Today it was 32, which is hot but ok hot
Next week it's gonna be 38-39 for several days (which qualifies for a heatwave)
Mid July to mid August it's usually brutal and I have heard it's gonna be **worse** than last year
The actual hot weather is supposed to start monday here
Well it's around 30-35°C every day, I live 5 minutes from the sea and I have a/c so it's ok
I worked a week with my dad on a truck in the middle of Athens with no a/c and I almost lost consciousness a few times (we had to deliver everything by 12 pm so we were running around stressed a lot)
Other than that it's normal summer time
The nights are always hotter
On May we had 42 in Crete, and was the same in many areas last year too
With a bit of carefulness we'll go through it again
I was being a bit dramatic with the "losing consciousness" Part but the heat is still painfull, and the elementary kids got their free milk that day with no one harmed
Sadly, neither our homes are built to dissipate heat
Even though I'm Greek, and we are pretty homogeneous as a country while also being a unitary state instead of a federation, I also feel very different, and it's not just me
Greeces establishment as a state was after 1820s. The liberetion of Northern parts came only after 1910s. To add on that many refugees came from Asia minor and Pontus during that period
Sole other parts of Greece, such ad Dodecanese Islands became part of Greece during late 40s.
People mainly in Pelloponisos and Sterea Ellada or Attica, the first parts that were liberated, feel more Greeks than for example Pelloponisians
Where I come from, from Macedonia, I first and foremost feel Macedonian and then Greek
Not to a big extend , but there is still this distinction in my mind
In general northern Greece is really different from Southern or Central
Macedonians, Epirotes, Thessalians, Thracians feel more connected to their respected areas (or simply Northeners) and then Greeks Fter that
These are my observations
In Northern Greece people might identify more to the region where they come from and then as Greeks
This does not really apply to the ones from Southern or Centeal (both mainland ) Greece
To me , it has to do more with the fact that Pelloponisos and Sterea Ellada were liberated first among others
Northern Greeks dont have that much in common with Southerns, mainly in culture , lifestyle etc
There are even differences between Noerthrners
For example me as a Macedonian dont have that much common ground with Epirotes when it comes in culture or food
Of course we speak the same language , with some dialectical changes, but still
It's really weird
In Greece, everyone says Agrinio is the ugliest and most boring city but i can't confirm it since i have never been there
Athens
Sometimes it's called as one of the most ugliest cities in Europe
i live there, can confirm
Because it's a fact
This is one of the few times in my life I really prefer america's way on this over central europe's.
It is no one's business what you do if it doesn't hurt anyone in any way, and no one should have a reason to shame you for it
Yes, please do stop people from yelling in public, or annoying passersby with "Can I tell you about jesus". But no one should have a say at what you wear (nudity in front of minors being the exception) or whether you do like jesus a lot, but in private
same
My point is that appropriateness and such superficial societal standards are things societies should be leaving in the past, not enforcing
Article 1 [Parliamentary Democracy]
(1) Greece is a Parliamentary Democracy with a President as Head of State
(2) Popular sovereignty is the foundation on which the form of government rests
(3) All powers are derived from the People, exist for the benefit of the People and the Nation, and are
exercised in the manner determined by the Constitution
Article 1
The form of government of Greece is that
of a parliamentary republic
Popular sovereignty is the foundation of
government
All powers derive from the People and
exist for the People and the Nation; they shall
be exercised as specified by the Constitution
It's similar to the Greek one
Sounds about right
The police here are
well, pigs
A lot of them are young, repressed people who follow right-wing ideologies
This is especially true with the new government that has been elected
Yeah
sorry about that
Yeah toilets in Athens are not a thing and it pisses me off, being a person that drinks 3-4 liters per day
Once I couldn't hold it and I had to ask the station manager if they had a toilet
At least she was kind enough to unlock one that is intended for handicapped people
Hahaha that is nuts, who the hell gets arrested twice in another country
Must be a crazy indeed
You are right about the other thing, not necessarily young, but most often than not they are (at least here)
That is VERY alarming to me, because these people want to be cops
And like Yanis Varoufakis once said about politicians "If you WANT to be a politician, that's the wrong reason
You should become a politician because you have to, not because you want to", similarly I think the same can be applied if you want to be a cop in highly police-corrupted countries
Ahahaha sounds like a cool teacher though ;)
That's fucking odd for sure
Ah he was on the other side of trouble then, shit
Which part of your country do you feel most sorry for
For example, in northern Greece there is a city called Ptolemaida (37,000 residents) which is right next to the EU's largest lignite mine
The economy of the town is entirely dependent on the mine and the negative effects of the mine are well known
The residents have the lowest life expectancy in Greece and cancer rates are abnormally high
Every year the mine gets larger and swallows up more and more villages
Everyone in Greece feels sorry for these people
Sometimes, they can even be nasty about it ("Don't touch someone from Ptolemaida
They might give you cancer
Do you have something equivalent in your country
Residents who just seem to live in the worst area or be victims of some industrial/natural disasters
Αυτο δεν το ηξερα
Same with Ptolemaida
The residents don't want the mine to close even though they know it's slowly killing them
IIRC there is a plan in place to completely phase out lignite by 2028, however ΔΕΗ has already invested something like €950m to Ptolemaida V power unit project so it's up for debate how that will be handled and how that will affect the residents livelihood
>phase out lignite by 2028
Are we going to use compressed fart gases then
"The government aims for wind, solar and hydroelectric power to account for at least 35% of Greece's energy consumption by 2030"
Other articles on this very subject state *renewable* *energy* *sources* without going into details, the above was the most specific I could find
Idk dude, it's definitely a bold and environmentally conscious move, but fuck knows how it will play out considering the layered mismanagement that seems to be ever present in Greece, unemployment issues, polarisation instead of constructive debate in public opinion, and the inherent corruption of an elitist self serving system
The Greek Civil war was fought between the Greek government army (supported by the United Kingdom and the United States) and the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE) — the military branch of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) (supported by Yugoslavia, Albania and Bulgaria) from 1946 to 1949
The Soviet Union avoided sending aid
The fighting resulted in the defeat of the DSE by the Hellenic Army
The struggle was one of the first conflicts of the Cold War and represents the first example of Cold War postwar involvement on the part of the Allies in the internal affairs of a foreign country
Not many people are aware that during World War 1, half of the country was sort of "friednly" occupied by Entente forces (mostly French), the king wanted neutrality (he was pro-German), the PM and (now) historical leader Venizelos wanted to join Entente, so he invited them in Thessaloniki, which they militarily occupied
Later the Entente had enough of the king, so the French bombed Piraeus and pushed the king's troops out of Athens
The king abdicated and fled, and we joined Entente
This is also thanks to German admiral Canaris, who was sabotaging Hitler, so he persuaded Franco that it is not in his benefit to join the war
Taking his advice, Franco was asking absurd things from Hitler in order to join, knowing that he could not give them to him
Also the first use of napalm bombs
Also people don't know that the RAF bombed civilian working class neighborhoods in Athens something that not even the nazis did
It was also the start of the Trotsky-Stalin rift
Trotsky was leader of the army and Stalin was general in a unit (he was below Tukachevsky in rank)
Tukachevsky (with Trotsky's agreement) had ordered Stalin to stop the siege of Lwow and join his army in the Vistula near Warsaw
Stalin ignored him, the Polish codebreakers had decrypted the Soviet radio messages and in a pincer movements encircled the Soviet Army and from there pushed them back all the way to Belaurs
It is rumoured that it is also one of the reasons that the Soviets were hating the Polish more than the other nations they ruled over for the rest of the century post-WW2
Not feeding that one stray cat that sleeps outside your house everyday
What kind of heartless person would see the poor thing starving and do nothing about it
Trying to follow the rules and do things properly, without trying to pull any favors or find someone from the inside
Mind blowing, I know
I think most cold countries/regions
Especially places that it snows in the winter
Also most of the near east
I wish all cities had Dutch-like bicycle infrastructure
Unlike many languages where the word for the Moon (Moon, Mond, Luna) can apply to any moon in the solar system, Greek has a word which only applies to this Moon; Selene
When writing numbers we use , to signify decimals and . for thousand
For example 130
400
000,024
According to the Greek grammar, **all** **proper names** need a definite article and are to be used with it (in the appropriate gender, case and number) at **all** times
I wonder if any other languages have this
We have a lot in common with many other European languages in terms of grammar and vocabulary
If there is something that sets us apart it´s the alphabet
I know it was used by the Karamanlides to write the Turkish language, and Wikipedia suggests a few other occasions Greek script was used for writing other languages ( [ ), but no other language uses it today afaik
I know Finnish has this as well, but it's still rare
The way we treat names
We conjugate names like we do ordinary nouns, we use articles for them and we also have a vocative case for when we're calling for someone
E.g suppose someone's name is Giorgos
• "Giorgos is here" would be "**Ο Γιώργος** είναι εδώ" (Nominative)
• "Giorgos' house" would be "Το σπίτι **του Γιώργου**" (Genitive)
• "Call Giorgos" would be "Τηλεφώνησε σ**τον Γιώργο**" (Accusative)
• "Giorgos, come here" would be "**Γιώργο,** έλα εδώ" (Vocative)
Selene to koritsi tou mai
If anyone's wondering, that's pronounced /Se'lini/ and it's the equivalent of Latin "Luna".
We say no by making  a "ts" sound (kinda)
> Gender neutral and uncomplicated (no extra meaning like “friend”) word for boyfriend/girlfriend
Using "kæreste" is what made me fall deeper in love with Danish, it's just so wholesome and cute
Same with μαλάκα which is a common Greek slang word that has a variety of meanings like wanker or asshole
Most countries use comma as the decimal separator
In my experience, what surprises foreign people who learn Greek is that we use it in front of first names and surnames
Other than that, it's not that different from what you'll find say in German
With that said, Wikipedia says Portuguese and Catalan too use the article with first names
I've been told it can be used in Argentinian Spanish too (eg el José)
I see what you did there
From my understanding, a lot of science fiction writers use "Luna" for the name of the Moon, but it's official name in English actually is the Moon, and Luna is Spanish and Italian (and Latin)
And yes, Selene is the moon goddess and the moon itself; for ancient Greeks, the god *was* the object
To try and separate them/see them as distinct is entirely modern
> there are 18 cases in total, I think no European language has more
That'd be correct, Finnish has 15
Unpopular opinion here, but I totally prefer winter hour
I get the impression that it's always early with winter hour and you have more "me". Instead with summer time, the hours go by like running water
Summer
But please stop switching, it's pointless and annoying
A hate clock changes about as much as I hate admitting this but I think the system works well enough as it is
It's the best of both worlds tbh
I prefer winter time
I like waking up in the morning not in the fucking night to go to work ! On those damn winter morning you can get a glimpse of the sun when you take the car to go to your job and by the time you return is already night anyway
Could someone care to explain everyone doesn't like switching time 2 days per year
I think keeping winter time would be nice
I wouldn't love to wake up to a dark sky
Don't mind coming back home to one, I'm quite a night owl
100% summer time cause i'd rather wake up before sunrise than have sun down at 6-7 pm
Summertime so it becomes night time between 20:00-21:00
I don't like it when it becomes night at 17:30
Maybe it doesn't for the northern countries where there's not much sunlight anyway, but in the south where it's abundant, one hour difference can be cumbersome as the day becomes larger
In the election of 2019 the Golden Dawn (fascist) party didn't get any seats in the parliament
Athens would be amazing
I wanna see gta where you're a chav
Athens would be ideal from a landscape perspective
Mountains surrounding it making it a basin, and the sea is right there
Just keep the explosives away from the Parthenon and we’re good
Crete
They already drive like they're in GTA there and most are armed to the teeth (trust me in from there)
So basically Crete
Shops in tourist areas put small water bottles in outrageous prices 500ml 2,5€  and for 750ml 3,5€ similar to Paris
When the 500ml bottle is 0,50€ and the 750ml 0,75€
Dare I say Mykonos
Yes, I do
What I hear when some foreigner saying that they want to visit Mykonos is that they want to experience what many other Aegean islands have to offer at an impossibly high price
Unless you are loaded, Mykonos might be pretty but it's not worth it
If you are really set on visiting the island, maybe do so for a day or so just to seen Little Venice and a wind mill or two and then run away as fast as possible without looking back, because not even a glare is free of charge there
Santorini and mykonos
Everything is overpriced there and almost no Greeks visit that place anymore because of that and tourist overpopulation
Athens in general as a city
(Greece)
Ios and Mikonos islands
Mykonos
Super overpriced for what it's worth
Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful island, just overhyped
Every highly populated island has nightlife as well as rowdy beach bars
Most of these examples though don't charge 50 euros for a salad
I sat inside, and I agree it's more pricey for Portuguese standards, but it's still cheap
The natinhas though are quite different from any other, and also they're always hot as they constantly bake them
Not better, just different
Same thing happened in Greece though they didn't banned Uber but the option where non taxi drivers can sign up use their car and take rides
Wow, I knew some things about the taxis in Turkey but this changes the whole perspective
I'm definitely using Uber when I get to visit your country
Sorry, i was carried away
Maybe an equivalent of Uber
My most usual breakfast is some kind of pastry thing (spanakopita, croissant, or whatever something along the lines of that) with greek/turkish coffee
I eat yoghurt with honey frequently
I love olive oil and may or may not overuse it sometimes during cooking
In the summer I nap for about an hour after lunch, and I complain if there's even 2-3 clouds in the sky
Idk what other stereotypes there are
first from Greece
oh well
I'm so atypical that people from other countries that have been to Greece or met Greeks never perceive me as Greek (unless I tell them)
most of the times they think I'm from Spain
LOL
some things that I don't do as typical Greek:
- drink tsipouro or ouzo
- go out to a  taverna
- go to skiladika (doghouses, big halls with live greek music)
- listen to greek music (I mean at all)
- go to the beach in the summer to spend hours under the sun to get a tan
- visit greek islands
- buy excessive groceries
if I want one banana and three apples, I buy one banana and three apples
and a lot more
when I did a questionnaire about which european country fits someone the most my result was Norway
Stereotypes I don’t fit
I am not really fond of the sea,I prefer the mountains
I hate the sun ,i love cloudy weather .
I absolutely despise feta cheese
I am not friendly
I am never late
I don’t like ouzo,I prefer vodka
Stereotypes i fit
I can’t currently think of anything
I have lots of cousins, most of which I’m close with
I love the sea and the sun
I can eat mountains of feta
Not loud and extroverted, though
We all know that the only place in France from which you can't see the Eiffel Tower is it's interior
Presents feta, you called for salty
What can I even say about Greece
It's either a paradise if we're talking about one of the popular islands, or a very poor and filthy country (both in how it looks but also the people)
I distinctively remember a Scooby Doo episode that I watched when I was younger where the gang went to Athens I think, and there was this weird, creepy guy who didn't really speak English and who kept freaking them out
And the general look of the place was very dark, very gloomy and dirty looking, and the only thing that you could see was ancient Greek ruins
No houses or any other modern-ish looking building
But I may not remember everything correctly about that last thing
And the pastries
Don't forget the pastries
It's quite infuriating when they portray all of Greece as being on a coast
We have lots of mountains, people
And they're way more beautiful than the barren, overpriced, overrated islands
I've been refusing to watch this movie my whole life
I will die on this hill
Not exactly about the EU, but about Erasmus (which is an EU program)
I had seen a video claiming that Erasmus was created so young people from different countries would hook up and eventually some of them would have kids
Having kids with parents of different nationalities would help to mix different European nationalities together
Edit: The point the video was making was that this (young people making babies) is the primary goal of Erasmus
According to the video the academic and culture exchange goals of the program are just cover-up
We have some crazy stories about alien origins that I am too ashamed to even joke about
Do you write 'α' or 'a' ?
as far as i know everybody in Greece writes α
I write **α**. **a** Is a bit harder to write for me, I tried it a few times but it looked completely wrong
In addition, it's the same as in Greek, which makes it easier
I am writing α all the time, I tried doing the English a and I can't
so pretty much everyone in the comments says they write α
so then why don't they change it in general, it's normal for languages and alphabets to evolve,though it has stopped these days because of how well documented everything is but if everything was in handwriting i'm sure α would be normal and a would become history
Since we're talking handwriting here
Is it weird that my æ kinda looks like a φ? I'll make an edit with a pic asap lol
Edit: [I'm a boomer when it comes to imgur I hope I've done this correctly]
i kinda did the same with f,y and g mostly cause of maths but originaly because my teacher said my g looked like a 9 and i could get less points in my english proficiency exams (when i changed g i also did y because they have similar shapes)
Nah she was just looking out for me it was like a suggestion because in these exams the guys who correct them would simply give you a bad grade if they had trouble reading your hand writing because they correct so many exams they have no tolerance
Yeah she was a good teacher but as you can see my english had gotten very rusty lmao
Thanks it's just that I noticed a few mistakes in my comments, but if you say it's fine then it is have a good one
We mostly are joking about taking back Konstantinopole (Instabul)
However it is worrying that there are quite a few people who believe that someday we are going to retake it
... I mean
I'm sure the same is true for my Balkan friends too
Not this time spaghetti man
> However it is worrying that there are quite a few people who believe that someday we are going to retake it
I seriously wonder what they *think* we're supposed to do with the millions of Turks living there
I think that the people who are actually willing to attack Turkey are extremely few, even compared to the ones that believe in a retaking some time in the future
It's more of a wishful thinking by a part of the population than a realistic idea of the majority
Contrary to what *ahem* certain countries have been led to believe
God will disappear them (to hell ?), of course
I have exactly the same question
I'm in
Let me tell you about the year 285 AD and a mad lad called Diocletian :D
Back then the empire was indeed called Eastern Roman Empire however the majority of its population was greek
The city of Constantinople thrived and ruled  inhabited mostly by greeks so i don't think citizens of the city of Rome would be interested
Why the hell we would want to take Iran
Cause of Alexander the Great
Greek soldiers never gunned down Syrian refugees
ummmmmmmmm no
Very little coverage by the Greek media
And about the protests, I'm supporting them ofc
Hopefully Lukashenko will be resigned soon, together with Trump, Johnson, Bolsonaro, Orban, Vucic, Putin, Erdogan & co
I don't really watch the news in TV but as far as I know, Belarus wasn't even mentioned
I know about the situation from Reddit and Twitter
I don't watch tv but I do see it on online Greek media
Atm though we also have had deadly floodings with several dead (among them, a baby), and Turkey problems
They also have just started talking about the dictator in Belarus winning the elections and how Putin congratulates him, so that's the 'news' from Belarus for the day
This is what I could find about specifically the protests, in different Greek popular sites of various political backgrounds (left, right):
It's in Greek, but if you're interested you could Google translate the pages to see how they view it
* Proto Thema  [
* EF SYN [
* NEWS247  [
* To Vima  [
* Athinaiko-Makedoniko Praktoreio Eidisewn  [
the rest sites reproduce the above pretty much
In some sites it was easy to find in the front page, and in others I had to use the search bar
It's weird to have dictatorship within Europe nowadays, especially when the other leaders look away
I doubt our media knows that Belarus is even exist
If it was happened in a country like Venezuela or Iran it would've been a hot topic here but since it's happening in a obscure country like Belarus they won't give a single damn
I saw many reports about the protests in Lebanon in the Greek media but nearly nothing about Belarus
Radio stations and TV channels
Like why aren't there any nationwide channels and radio stations broadcasting the same content at the same time
(ot adjusted, considering time zones)
You should go to Turkey
They're their European equivalent as far as flag displays go
-Hi my name is Kevin Im calling from blabla how are you this afternoon
-I... Sorry Kevin I... I dont think Im prepared for this
-Dont worry friend the sun is still shining, whats there that cant be resolved
-Uh
ah *proceeds to go to the bathroom to explosively puke*
Our government has done some horrible and despicable things
And definitely still is
It's reasonable to fear the US government
I'll beam it to the politicians
Imagine being an American and reading this
Grenade attacks
Could you please elaborate
I can't choose so I'm gonna mention two :)
Kastoriá! It's a stunningly beautiful town in northern Greece, right next to a lake, and it's a good kept secret because it's not faithful to the stereotypical "Greek dream" (sun, beaches)
Métsovo
That's more of a village than a city but its natural beauty stands out a lot
It has an altitude of 1
160m making it a perfect winter destination, houses are made in a beautiful stone/wooden style and the local food is PHENOMENAL
Well kind of the opposite but Athens is considered by almost If not all Greeks the ugliest city in Greece
italian:
kazzo = dick,
puzza = something like "you smell",
tutti = all,
nero = black,
pizza = pizza (obv
greek:
(na) katso = to sit,
poutsos/poutsa = dick,
touti = her,
nero = water,
petsa = skin,
(also portuguese peão = pawn (?), greek peos = penis)
(also also english penis = penis, greek peinas = you're hungry)
Spanish mesa (table) means indoors/inside in Greek
That's what y'all get for having "skat" as a word of endearment
Germany or Poland
I love those countries
Efficient and really typical in everything
I have travelled a lot to both countries and each time i am flabbergasted about the minimum time you need to do anything
But both languages, especially the german one is a pain to learn
Most German words, seem to come out throught scrabble
The one with the highest points get to go on the german dictionary
Denmark ️
France , and paris in particular
I visited once and I was astonished
I haven't visited many european countries yet so it's a bit biased
As much as I want to travel around I can't imagine myself living anywhere else other than Greece so I'd just move to Heraklion (from a town near Athens)
Next closest thing, Italy
Greece is nice, but Switzerland is nice too
Island life can be tough however especially in the winter
First time ever hearing of it
Also I didn't know that that was the French I thought it was the standard
I only know it bcs I lived  for some time in Madrid
I doubt anyone uses it in Greece
YES
Not just the elderly
Where I come from they should be doing annual driving tests from 18 and up
We have so many car accidents we lose the amount of people the equivalent of a town, every year
Plus the drivers behavior is awful
They park on every pavement, block streets, make noise at 3am with loud music, etc
Add to that if someone is old and feels entitled and you got yourself one of the biggest daily life problems in Greece
Yes, totally
You can't expect the cognitive functions of a 65+ year old person to be at 100%. In my opinion many elderly drivers are an increased threat to themselves and other drivers/pedestrians
The ideal answer to this is an upgraded infrastructure system that plans for groups like elderly people and people with disabilities, maybe a dedicated bus line or something similar
In general, when a place has solid and efficient infrastructure to offer, sometimes cars can be the worse choice
Why drive 45 minutes downtown when a train can get you there in 20
25+ is hot
20 to 25 is warm
15 to 20 is alright
10 to 15 is chilly
3 to 10 is cold
-5 to 3 is fairly cold
Below -5 it's freezing
Anything bellow 20 is Chilly
Anything bellow 10 is deadly cold
Around 20°C chilly
10°C to 15°C cold
Below that we are getting into freezing territory
But both my parents house and the place I live and study are by the sea and generally have milder Temps
People in the mountainous areas of Greece will have much lower Temps to report
For summer anything less than 22⁰C or so is cold
And for winter anything less than 10⁰C.
In general, I'd say below 10 it's time to throw on a jacket, below 5 maybe add some gloves to that
Lower than gloves needed it's snowing where I am
Anything below 25-20°C, anything higher it's avg greek weather
Heyyyy, a Southern European who agrees with me
I know we're not as tolerant to cold as our northern bros, but the people above saying jacket at 20 had me going crazy
Oh yeah definitely
For me 10-20 is hoodie weather, above 20 is t-shirt weather and below 10 is jacket weather, if I wore a jacket at 20° I'd decompose
A map of europe but words
these
Wars,history and europe(the lady the continent got its name from)
I just picture the EU, a map of it, and that one picture with the flags lined up
Everyone in Europe says Europe lol
It’s a great name after all
I love winters, there is something romantic and warm being inside with friends playing board games and drinking while it's cold or even snowing outside
It's good
I'm from Greece
We have basically the same climate here as Melbourne
To be honest the winters here are short and not very cold
The annoying part is the early spring though because one day it could be t-shirt temperature and the next could be full coat temperature
But you are allways drinkingi  feel taht the lack of sun is just an excuse
same here
Australia sounds like a nice place to live honestly(except the spiders and the sharks and everything that can probably kill you)
Always the party that gave me hopes, even if it doesn't represent my ideology, if it gives hope that it will do good, then it has my vote
Yet all of them have never failed to disappoint me
In a national level, the lesser evil
In a more local level, I have voted for someone who genuinly seemed to want to make things better, but she didn't win
Once as a young and naive 19 year old I really believed in the party I chose and the political system in general
Now I truly believe a revolution or at least a corruption purge is in order
I belong to the 40% (roughly) of voters who choose not to vote
For the lesser evil ofc
All Greek political parties are ABSOLUTELY godawful
Sadly there's not a single political party which is really close to me
Greece has the most amount of smokers in the European Union which is understandable considering how cheap it is to smoke in Greece and the majority of Eastern Europe
Every fucking one smokes here
And the thing is I despise smoking and cigarettes it makes me actually sick
I have sworn to myself I'll never smoke
very common, almost everyone does it and it's treated like a normal thing
[wikipedia says] that 37% of Greeks were smokers as of 2017 but it doesn't look like there is any more recent data
Among the youth especially, most smoke on occasion, and it is very widely regarded as unhealthy and stinky
I honestly can't think of another regular smoker in my circle of friends
Ok πεοστύφτη
You could join a car club it's a common thing in Europe , the down side is that I know only of European car make clubs or even Japanese but no American ones
Just say Alexander the Great was not Greek and you can create an army with torches and pitchforks
When we get stalled at the airport when abroad, because they think our ID card is fake
Once, i was asked for a passport because in their words "the ID is written only in Cyrillic"! 1
The ID has english in it too, 2
Cyrillic
Really
In Greek we call the Netherlands "Ολλανδία" (lit
just Holland) and the Dutch "Ολλανδοί" (Holland-ers)
Only if someone wants to sound fancy will they say "Κάτω Χώρες" (Nether-lands)
Took me a while to stop calling the country "Holland" in English as well
Sorry
And we still don't have a word for Dutch
Sorry, but you are all Hollanders for us
God I physically cringed
pathetic attempt at trolling tbh
Yes, by a couple of monks that adapted it to the needs of the Slavs
Oh man I get it, imagine if the whole of Greece was just called Attika and the people Atticians or something, that would pretty much trigger a civil war, to be honest
We are capable of handling a health crisis
Damn Italians with their colonies
leave
Like swim
Well we mostly fucked ourselves but the way Germany handled it wasnt the ideal rom economic perspective
Idk Dave it sounds logical
What do you mean they cant come back
they cand find the way back or you prohibit them by law to come back
My (quite long) experience with beaches in Greece (islands and mainland since the 70s and the 80s) is that it used to be more than 50% - especially in the 80s: it was like there was an unwritten rule for women that they must go topless, especially British and German women
Other nationalities were not as keen
It is fa, far less now, probably because of the fear of the sun
Greek here
Less than 1 in 10 is about right
unless you're a very small kid or in a nudist beach it's 0% (in Greece at least)
used to be a lot but since it became common knowledge that sunbathing can cause skin cancer a lot less
Early modern and middle are fine, and I can get the scottish text but I don't ùnderstand every single word
The other two are indecipherable to me
Why did English drop ð and æ? I can understand dropping æ in favour of a simple a in place, but why ð? It's more compact than "th".
In the first Monday of Lent the town of Tyrnavos celebrates the Feast of Phallus or Burani
There are times when Christ looks the other way to humour the old gods
Every time former PM Tsipras opened his mouth to say something in English, he's top meme material over here on this subject
Nothing recent though, since our current one speeks  perfect English, sadly no memes there
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you one Alexis Tsipras, our previous prime minister
i would like to introduce to you [Alexis Tsipras]
[another video of him]
in [this instance] he is trying to say "we have eaten the donkey, and now all that's left is the tail" it's a Greek saying and he butchered it
I don't know if you know Tsipras (former Prime Minister of Greece) ... Won't say more, [I'll let the man speak for himself]
It has to be Alexis Tsipras' "Madam Merkellll" I don't have a link right now but please check it out
Because of his inability to speak English properly even at a basic level he has become a laughing stock among the people
Yeah, I remember the clip of Mitsotakis in the White House to give you an idea of how well he speaks the English language
Trump was shouting at reporters saying the absolute same words over and over again for the majority of that meeting, while Mitsotakis spoke for a handful of minutes and spoke with a better vocabulary and better linguistic cohesion than the President of the United States
Another great interview was with historian Niall Ferguson
I was shocked at the time Clinton was making fun of him for not being able to understand English or not making sense when he was speaking
That’s the moment I decided I’m never going to vote for that guy
He just humiliated our country at an international level
Trump bought his way through education, there's former associates of his claiming he doesn't know jack-sh\*t on many subjects, he just pays associates most of the time to do the thinking for him (though I think that's apparent from the crazy yiayia+taxi driver bs he'd spout for the virus)
It's also apparent from the way he always speaks like he's on that reality show of his or maybe some fashion police-style show
You know that movie with Voutsas and Moustakas playing two almost illiterate rich men
Think that but limited to Trump himself
Well tbf even Tsipras speeks better English than Trump lmao
Jk Mitsotakis English is on an academic level, it's always pleasant to hear him, not to mention that he speeks also German and French if I'm not mistaken
That’s exactly what I think too
He grew up with money and he thought to himself, “I don’t need education, it’s only a money-making tool
I already have money”.
Well, it doesn’t work that way
You can’t be the President of the United States and be illiterate
Hahaha I absolutely get the movie reference
You’re absolutely correct
Hahahah that’s an extreme statement
I recently heard Tsipras on an interview with Sroiter on Alpha and he kinda dropped a few financial terms in English, showing off what he’s learned
Guess who’s got a tutor
Yeah, to the point that when you’ve heard Mitsotakis in English, he kinda sounds boring in Greek
He’s way more articulate and expressive in English
He is a very well educated person, his French is great too
Once upon a time, a pretty big group of people went down Greece, found a nice place, slaughtered the locals and kept the rest as slaves
And that's how Sparta came to be
Once there was Asia, and then there was a really short 20 year old man
You know the rest
I played a game about this called my child lebensborn, it was about a Norwegian man adopting a kid that had German nationality (propably through rape)
The game takes place right after ww2 and its a really sad game because the kid keeps getting called nazi and bullied because of his origins
Was that really how Sparta was formed
Any sources for this
Asia minor catastrophe
it was, they kept the locals as slaves for generations to come to, known as the [helots] Appart from wikipedia my only other source is the greek school system, unfortunately I can't link to that
to be fair, yeah this kinda stuff happened a lot at 1300 BC
Sincere question, would it be controversial to say Alexander was greek
Cause I only know how we and Macedonia view him, so dunno what's the global consensus
Wait, what did you or us do
I've never heard that in school, thanks for the source tho
exactly like that actually
The Macedonia thing is political issue only and it's just about the name
The claims of ancient Macedonians being related to North Macedonia is not taken seriously by anyone at least important
So it's 100% safe to say it
Ps: Alexanders family doesn't even originate from Macedonia they come from Argus in South Greece hence the name  Argead dynasty comes from
Alexander the Great was Greek fam
Like it's not even up for a debate
He spread Hellenism to every place he conquered, he was born in Pella, spoke greek as his first language
These are all facts you can look up yourself
Not even up for debate
Δεν μαθατε για τους ειλωτες και το Σπαρτιατικο συστημα δουλειας ?
I was talking about the modern one tbh since the previous ones were never "Greece", it wasn't even that much of a concept in ancient times
Δε θημαμε κάτι
It's rumored he was very compassionate about his soldiers, but really fucking stupid when it came to their needs
For example there's a tale about him saying "if you can't drink, then neither will I" and spilling his waterskin on the sand as they were crossing a dessert and dying from dehydration
He tried to show compassion, but **spilled his water** instead of fucking **sharing** it
Alexander the Great wasn't such a great guy
Agreed , in the end nationalism hurts both sides and the arms race is rediculus
We could have been spending more money in healthcare  inferstraction  education  and technology, yet both countries buy and create weapons with all that money
Δευτερελθόθλιψη (Dhefterelthóthlipsi)
There, I just created it for you too
Sure does, look at what the Madman Aristophanes has created on this basis [here]
It means Monday coming sadness (Δευτέρα+ελθ+θλίψη) that's why I'm not using Sunday
There are many in Greece, all the year long
but  like there
Same date ..24/6
fires, dances, songs, ... The name of the festival "klidonas" young girls suppose to learn their future husband's name
Is the start of summer,  and  celebrate the new wheat(and what ever else) picked up from the fields
Am Greek-American but we celebrate our name days every year in honor of our names' patron saints
My mom did the klidonas, she saw someone with curly hair inside a wooden boat paddling but the boat was on a field of wildflowers, not the sea
The moment she saw him she recognised him and it turns out he was a carpenter
She said yes imediately which surprised her family since they had many suitors but she disliked all of them
Then years later my mom's friend decided to do this with her daughter (she had done the other one with the αμίλητο νερό when she was younger)
Her daughter 'saw' a short guy next to a big desk with a weird cursive symbol/logo
I remember her she was totally confused and hated he was short
Years later she got married with a short guy that was working as the official representative of Coca Cola in the region
I never did it
My mom thought I was too young at the time (I was a preteen) and then she thought it won't make a difference and I forgot about it (cause you have to do it on st
john's day if I remember well)
&#x200B;
**GREECE:**
Now, OP, in Greece we have tons of ancient traditions that survived
[Many have to do with religion as it was typical of Christians to adjust religious beliefs through ancient Greek customs and traditions] That was a known tactic as it was helping the new christians relate with it easier
**Wedding rituals**, the  **procession with candles on Good Friday** was taken from eleusinian mysteries (we only know a few things about them), we also still have **lament song in funerals** although now it's rare; my grandma had asked to have the traditional/ancient 3 day funeral with professional lament singers from Mani region and they came and 'cried' for her and sang the songs about Hades and all (it was so fucking cool), we also have the **evil eye** from 6th century BC and the ways of 'eliminating' it, we have the **burning of Judas** on easter, **Ηλιούγεννα (sunbirth)** which was our Xmas, **koliva** a mixture of barley, pomegranates, wheat, nuts, raisins etc that is given in funerals and every time they commemorate the dead, **putting a golden coin under the head of the dead so they can cross river Styx** (we did that secretly from the priest or else he could get so pissed off he could refuse to burry the dead), **απόκριες (carnival)**, **carols**, **blessings**, and a gazillion other things, ouf
I'll piggy back on this one
Koudounofori, bell bearers, in some places in North Greece, as well as North Macedonia and Bulgaria at the start of spring some men will dress with goatfur, masks, sticks and big bells, on the waist, looking very primal, and dance in procession through a village or town ringing the bells in the process to scare evil spirits n shit, never witnessed it myself but want up
It's obviously pre Christian and apparently from Neolithic period
I remember reading Corsica or Sardinia had a very similar tradition too
A greek who doesn't like feta cheese
I'm a Greek who doesn't like tzatziki
A Greek that doesn't like souvlaki, dislikes feta, constant sunny weather and high temperatures all the time ?
a greek that doesn't like souvlaki
A greek who doesn't love souvlaki
Unpopular opinion: Feta cheese is disgusting (most of the time)
i am calling the inquisition to purge this heresy
I'm 189cm in the country of dwarves
:o the one in a million
How dare you D:
Well most are trying but it is difficult with the salaries here
Ο Ήλιος (the sun, male)
Το φεγγάρι (the moon, neuter)
Η Σελήνη (the moon, female)
Well the moon has 2 names one that is the original and one that is for some reason used today so
Sun=Hélios (male)
Moon=Selíni(female)
Also moon=Feggári (neutral)
Ο Ηλίος ( The Sun) male
Το Φεγγάρι (The Moon) neutral
Η Σελήνη (The Moon) feminine
earth: η γη (female), moon: το φεγγάρι (neutral)/η σελήνη (female), sun: ο ήλιος (male)
Ο Ήλιος: male
Ή Σελήνη or Το φεγγάρι: female and neutral
In Greek it's masculine for the sun "ο ήλιος" and neutral for the moon "το φεγγάρι"
o Ílios (masculine) and i Selíni (feminine) in modern Greek :)
[O Chrysoús Aión tou Perikléous] (Pericles' golden century)
For the modern times, I would say the 80s and a bit of the 90s with Andreas Papandreou
Although he raised the national debt, he built most of the universities and he gave a tremendous help to the farmers
Imagine the farmers from the island Crete would fly to Athens to party for the weekend with Cuban cigars and then they would take the first plane in the morning and they would go immediately to work to their greenhouse
There were Mercedes sports cars filled with potatoes that they would deliver them to the city and then they would immediately go to party
It was really bazaar
Then for the medieval times, in the early 1000s there had been a huge boost of the Eastern Roman empire under Basil the second
The empire got doubled, retook the Balkans and it was perfect for everyone living in, except if you were rich
For Greece there are lots of them, Alexander the Great, Golden Age of Periklis and so much more
Although, I personally think that the real golden age of Greece is in the very first years when we started mathematics, sciences, theater and so much more
Yeah, well, yes, but it was 2,500 years ago
We call it the Golden Age of Pericles and it was mainly in Athens, not necessarily the whole of Greece
Back then, the Greeks fought a lot between them
Come to think of it, we still do
not sure if this counts but we see Ancient Greece and Alexander the Great's Macedonia as our Greatest times in history, it's hard to live up to those days
Fifth Century BC - Literally Called the [Golden Century]
This is when basically almost everything you know about ancient greece happened and influenced mankind ever since
Oh and the Age If Alexander The Great
Greece had an empire that spanned up to India and Egypt
I wouldn't call a period in which many people suddenly found themselves with more money than they were used to (or than they could imagine) as 'golden'. The 80s were surely a period of prosperity for Greek people (ασχέτως αν τώρα πληρώνουμε τα σπασμένα, κυριολεκτικά και μεταφορικά), it also opened up education to the vast majority of the population, but, as per your description, just partying and not investing, making research, being creative or excelling intellectually ... what kind of golden is that
The 80s were definitely happy times for Greece, but not golden times imo
Papandreou's era was our golden era
Hope you are joking
The clown state in which we are living today and which tortures us by all possible means, has its foundations back then
Unqualified and rude civil servants, non-existent state support for the citizens' problems, public companies with millions worth of yearly losses and astronomical wages, pensioners under 50, inexplicable tolerance of criminal activities, heavy taxation
It's all the remnants of his "socialistic" policies, which no later dominant political party dared to change
Sure, one or two generations had it all, but guess how many more are being (and will keep getting) fucked because of this "golden era".
Which one would you propose as a golden era in our modern history then
either the PASOK propaganda has worked wonders and people are unironically nostalgic for that era or that many people got so much money without deserving them, but then what pagkalos said and caused outrage is true
sometimes I feel like my family didn't live in Greece cause we never had 5 houses and 10 cars but still we have to pay for the partying others did and it seems it's a majority
As for the medieval times, I totally agree with you
More recently, perhaps during the Balkan wars
We gained/freed a big chunk of today's country and, unlike other periods of our history, we did so only through our army's superiority both at sea and on land, not because of the help of a big ally
Of course you can't compare that to more ancient times, for example during classical Greece, Alexander's period, or even during the 3 centuries of pax Romana when we were the cultural equivalent of today's USA in terms of influence
It's quite difficult for most people, especially for those ignorant of how the economy actually works, to comprehend what happened
They saw only the fat paychecks, the increase in wages and in public spending
Where the heck did this come from
What exactly did we produce to reach such a standard of living
Nothing, the State just kept on loaning and spending the money to establish their ever growing voting base
Even today it is difficult for most Greeks to understand this, despite being so obvious
"It's the Germans to blame, it's the Americans, it's the IMF
Oh my smartphone is from Korea, my router from China, my car from Germany, my TV from Japan, my clothes from Turkey/Malaysia/Taiwan, my money in Swiss banks, my military equipment from the US, all the big logistics companies in Netherlands
But in Greece we can produce everything
It's as simple as that: heavy taxation on every living organism, so that the State has enough to pay for their public servants and pensioners
And then begging big companies to come and invest
it's sad that even in that age where the money was supposedly flowing like a river the morons that they are didn't invest in anything to make their fortune greater or the country's, they just kept buying useless houses, even more useless cars and the rest throw it away at bouzoukia, no planning whatsoever about the future, only to show off now and sadly nothing has changed even after a decade of memorandums and with us learning what our stupidity cost us
Eh it depends, by the time of Nero " provincials" had full right and even someone ftom Spain ¥though still Roman citizen) could become Emperor
*Achtually* the French kings bought the title claims to the Byzantine empire by the last exiled Byzantine prince, so *technically*, and if we even assume the Republic acknowledges these, France is the de jure heir to the Empire
Hey, most Greeks are chill with France
I have never gone to such a trip but I'm sorry for your experience in Greece
If you don't plan things correctly it's easy to have such a trip anywhere
We were in Rome, me and 4 friends around 20 years old
One night we were strolling around and I stopped to check something in a shop which room a while
After going out I couldn't find my friends, I tried calling but no signal
After around 10 minutes I see my friend and he comes running to me and says the others met a guy that gave them coupons to an underground strip club when he learned they were foreign
So we go to the rescue
The place was down a long flight of stairs with two tall buff guys at the entrance
We go down and the place was almost empty with some shady looking guys and a couple of shitty strippers
So we pick them up and leave
It ended up not being a big deal but looking back things could have ended up much worse
OP I'm sorry for your experience
As someone born and raised in Rhodes, my first reaction was to laugh (it's not everyday the island is mentioned in Reddit)
I really liked your narration of the story
I hope you can visit again and actually enjoy the vacation(and the beaches)
I'm Greek  but I've spent some years in england, and imo England outside of London gets very little love
Most of my Greek friends who have been to England for tourism have visited London alone, but English nature is very beautiful and there are lots of nice towns too
Also the whole English ppl are cold and their food is terrible is just a stupid stereotype, for some reason it's okay to trash the English in ways that would be seen as ignorant for any other nation
And the rainfall thing is also not true, ppl could just check Wikipedia
Basically anywhere except Athens Santorini and Mykonos
Northern Greece, with Thessaloniki and Chalkidiki being the only exceptions, is definitely underrated
Greece is similar, the north west in particular is not only mountaineous, it is also rather poor and with less ancient monuments than the rest of the country
Still a very nice place to visit if you know where to go and when
> Still a very nice place to visit if you know where to go and when
Always been a mountain person
I fucking love the northwest
I'll take that over Santorini any time
Can't say for other countries, but yes, in Greece this is the stereotype of the English
Look up Kastoriá, Métsovo, Árta, and Pózar baths, they're all quite beautiful places
I'd say german is more advantageous within european borders, while spanish may serve you better should you cross the atlantic
My suggestion is that, if you find some time after studyimg german, continue on with french as well because they are a gateway to learning both spanish and italian
Definatly russian because of the many russian tourists
The drying rack in the cabinet is pretty common in many homes in Greece too
For anyone interested:
Mercury = Ερμής (Ermis/Hermes)
Venus = Αφροδίτη (Aphrodity/Aphrodite)
Earth = Γη (Gi from the goddess "Gaia")
Mars = Άρης (Aris/Ares)
Jupiter = Δίας (Dias, another name for Zeus)
Saturn = Κρόνος (Kronos, named after the Titan)
Uranus = Ουρανός (Uranos, also used in modern greek to say "sky")
Neptune = Ποσειδώνας (Posidonas/Posidon)
i always use butter for frying eggs didn’t know other mediterranean people literally use olive oil for everything
That's because you haven't visited Greece lol
We definitely have them, I thought they were universal as well
Actual butter or vitam(margarine)
ohh mostly vitam
Figured as much, vitam is mostly solidified palm oil (φοινικέλαιο), that's why it's also allowed for fasting (νηστεία)
> I very rarely hear any kind of appreciation for Danish
I can't stress this enough; I LOVE this language
It soothes my whole being, it sounds so warm and sweet, and the peculiar features of it (blødt D og stød) only make it even better
An unpopular opinion, for whatever reason
> and I’ve heard “why don’t we just switch to English lol” more than once
undskyld men NEJ
yeah ur right lol, i’m dumb i forgot they were different
Jeg lærer det bare for sjov:) jeg tror at det er mærkeligt for nogen i udlandet, fordi de fleste mennesker, der jeg har mødt, der lærer dansk, er i Danmark eller planlægger at bo i Danmark
Jeg er dog ligeglad, for at være ærlig, et sprog behøver ikke være "nyttigt" eller populært for nogen at lære det:)
(jeg håber at jeg har ikke lavet så mange fejl, da jeg er ikke endnu på et højt niveau)
Tusind tak
Probably Georgios Papadopoulos, head of the military junta that ruled Greece for seven years in the 20th century
And the rest of the colonels as well: Markezinis, Ioannidis, and Patakos
Also don't forget the Nazi colaborationist Georgios Tsolakoglou and the kings
He's my hero, for killing a genocidal maniac
>What about Metaxas
He's overlooked
Mainly due to not caving in to Mussolini's ultimatum
Still a disgusting figure no matter how you look him, outside of foreign affairs
>I personally like him since he criticed the asia minor campaign
No offense, but that is seriously very shortsighted; after all military foresight doesn't translate to civic responsibilities
He passed measures that put any dissidents either behind bars or to the firing line
Torture was widespread
He banned assemblies of more than 50 people
He banned the use of any language other than Greek in public spaces
He banned political parties and shutdown the parliament
He introduced equivalents to the Nazi salute and the Hitler youth
Censorship became a part of life
Books by Goethe, George Bernard Shaw, Sigmund Freud, Santayana, and others were gathered and burned in gigantic bonfires
He banned rebetiko
He passed anti Roma legislation
Oh and **he came to power after a coup**, after a referendum for the return of the king was staged
Enver Hoxa made Albania the most secular Southeastern European country with the highest literacy ratio, should Hoxa be celebrated do those things or hated for the million more horrific atrocities committed in Albania during that era
Same thing with Stalin for industrialising the USSR and Kim Il Sung for rebuilding the DPRK
He was a dictator, not a democratically elected
It's like you see a tree but don't see the forest
Metaxas was a dictator but we tend to overlook that because he said "Ochi" to Mussolini
spare a Euro for you Witcher
It's all Greek to me
Really hard I suppose
Does Garteh Bale count
yep, everytime i play csgo and someone spanish talks, i always think they are greek lol
Yes, as long as living expenses etc are able to support it
There is no point in working less if I have to "pay" it in another way
Armenia because their people, in my experience at least, really like us Greeks
Serbia for more or less the same reason
Serbians and Armenians are our bros for life
Britain and their allies, NZ & Aus, who fought and died in my country against our common enemies and not just in one war
Our debt to them can never be repaid
We owe them so much
Finally Haiti too
Haiti was the very first state to recognize the existence of the Greek State
Having only recently become independent themselves, they were the only ones who could understand our struggle for freedom
And even though they must have had myriad problems of their own,  they still spared effort and attention for us, and what little they did, was still huge
I would thank Great Britain for storing temporarily our marbles in top condition
I will thank them again when they are returned
You didn't specifically ask but Greeks can fully communicate with Cypriots but we can tell them apart from their accent
However if they want they can speak with a heavy accent and throw in some Cypriot words and we have a lot of trouble understanding them
Greece/Cyprus
They understand us but we do not understand them
Every time your president says something awkward, stupid or outrageous
That's almost daily
Pre-Trump the US was mentioned once a week, to give you an idea
Everyday, they are neutral torwards the US but they do report on anything bad happening
for example California or Trump's incompetence
usual news
Yes, especially with what is happening with Turkey and California
More often than not though, it's usually about cr\*p Trump does, especially the racist bs and dumb stunts he pulls to get re-elected
>Thats more like minute by minute
Well yes, but we sum it all up in a 5min broadcast, cause  otherwise our politicians wouldn't get any TV time to tell their own awkward, stupid, outrageous BS
An amazing day to you too ;)
I don't know for sure
The only way I consider myself European is because my country belongs to the EU and because most European countries share the same religion and are close geographically, so I guess that's a common thing we have
Yeah, maybe, idk
I probably consider myself more of a Balkan or South European, because our culture has more similarities with Spain, Italy, Serbia, Montenegro etc than with Sweden, Germany, England etc
Honestly, imo, the only reason why most Greeks want to consider themselves Europeans, and not Asians, for instance, is because of Germany, England and other Northern and/or Western European countries that are very wealthy and powerful
Which means that by adopting the "European identity" they want to be associated with them, and not with the poor developing countries of Asia, Africa etc
or the countries of USSR, since people of poorer countries are usually looked down on and are considered inferior, in some way
Indeed, some people might see it that way
But this is mostly an excuse Greek people use to be associated with rich European countries
Current Greek culture is is very different from Germany, Norway, Iceland etc
In many cases we have more in common with Jews and Turks, than we have with Danish and English, for instance
It's a little bit complicated
Santorini and Mykonos
There's a ton of other places that are not visited which are a must go
Auschwitz
It's just a museum with the prison-like layout
Rest of highlights are awesome but one of their most famous one got me disappointed
I loved bath as a town when I visited but I also love London <3
I feel like you haven't been to the UK until you've been anywhere besides London
I live in Santorini, and even though I am tired of the whole show, there truly isn't any other landscape like it, especially in Greece
It's worth it for the landscape and for other specific things, but the infrastructure and amount of people is a pain in the ass
I really preferred London over Bristol, bath on the other hand is incredible
That same view can be seen from many other islands that won't charge you an arm and a leg
I get that but mainland Greece has many worth going places like Meteora (big and high rocks with monasteries on top them, with breathtaking views)
I'm not saying that people should stop going there but Santorini foreshadows other must - go places in Greece
Meteora in Thessaly
Yeah Rhodes is a great and a lot cheaper than Santorini or Mykonos
How would you call it
True, it does foreshadow them, but at the same time it is not overrated (if that makes sense haha
Okay that's sounds right
Sorry, my bad
Waiting for the rival country to answer my comment
Honestly Greece has no better rival than Greece itself
All of our neighbors
Fucking Greeks ruined Greece
Welcome kardeş
All our neighbors but Bulgaria
Nah I don't think we ever see you as rivals, I actually really admire Iran and the Persian culture
More like disabled and "independent" little brother
The whole Balkan polygon i d say
I would say Albania is not a rival as well
I actually like Macedonians, I lived overseas for many years and I find that you have a very similar culture and sense of humour
We don't recognize it either brate
contentious as in "argumentative" or "controversial"?
love u 2 fam <3
Indeed brat
It's true though, glad you got a laugh lol
Fuck, the reference went over my head
I don't think we really dislike people, at least not for balkan standards
We have some problems with neighbours that are pretty much justified (Turkey being an eternal bully, North Macedonia plagiarising an important part of greek history etc
) but that's it
Indeed
Anywhere full of tourists and business focused only to tourists
London and Paris
I've been in both and honestly, they're overhyped
Only special thing about Paris was Disneyland
There are much more beautiful and more traditional places to see in Europe in terms of history, museums and architecture
I am half Hungarian half Greek
"Nem" is hungarian for "no" and "ne"/"ναι" means "yes" in Greek
Since we speak both in family they get mixed up
Also my Hungarian uncle's name is Kolos which means "ass" in Greek
Empathy in english means to understand and share the feelings of another person
Εμπάθεια (em-pà-thee-a) in greek means seething hate
I first learned the word in english, and it was a fun day at school when I found out the greek definition
The infamous word malaka
It can either mean asshole or a variation of cheese
I'd like to go to Spain
I love the culture and it is a very beautiful country in general
The ~~pen~~ultimate dream would be a villa in the tuscan countryside with a vineyard, horses and a massive library
Oh, and an Internet connection as well
In a more serious (or reasonable, perhaps more realistic, may I say) note, I would very much love to live in a nice, cosy apartment in Florence or Rome
They are living, breathing museums, I would be awestruck everyday
There is a sense of continuity with the past which I love and makes me feel so relaxed
I can't stand the [concrete hell] that is Athens
There is a small secret, Athens is a city that hates its history
Sure, there are ruins from Antiquity that we want to showcase to the happy-go-lucky tourists, but after that, only breadcrumbs
There are almost no traces of the 2000 years that have passed since then
It is literally just a monstrous collection of modern ugly buildings that have been built next to the remnants of the ancient city and span between the four mountains
This, along with some pretty bad personal stuff that I have associated with the city, make me want to escape from here
Maybe one day
Edit: the penultimate is the one in the second paragraph
I started to write abouth that and then my mind for some reason wandered off
Ι don't really like living here
One reason is that I despise the local climate with all my heart
The other reasons are
self explanatory
I like Greece
Maybe I'll move if I decide to do master's or a PhD in an other european country but (unless I meet someone or something like that) I don't think I'll stay abroad longer than I have to
I'm not idolizing it, I am well aware that it is a modern city with modern problems and not a picturesque land out of a carte postale
Despite that, you can't deny that it's an explosion of art and history
You guys do a much better job than us at preserving your past and incorporating it into the present
Even if I won't ever live in Italy, I still want to find time and money in order to spend a couple of months travelling from Aosta Valley and Piedmont all the way down to Calabria, Apulia and Sicily
Visit Sardinia too
-Knock knock
-Who is it
-Probably the majority of your neighbors
-And what do they want
-They want to fucking rape you
^ Pretty much our history until let's say the middle-end of the 20th century and onwards
Sometimes they succeeded and sometimes they didn't.
Strategically I guess we are quite important but also I love the culture that evolved because of the nice warm weather
Finally let me say that I'm a huge sea-lover and I adore the beach so I can't deny that I love our place on earth
I absolutely love it but since even centuries before the birth of Christ everyone has been wanting in on it
Greeks can relate to what you said
Greece and Portugal are on edge of continent
I mean for good scenery and places to go to for vacation Greece is great, but it being mountainous as shit is terrible for the economy
Thats so weird for me
Ive always been like a 10 min walk from the sea
Cant imagine my country without it
We moved to Greece from Russia because we identify as Greeks by ethnicity and after the USSR collapsed most of our relatives moved to Greece, so after some years my family did as well for a better future
Unfortunately, now both countries suffer from corruption, so both of them are not great for a stable living
I feel like both of countries are my home
I know that I am greek by ethnicity and nationality, and russian by nationality
I love both countries but I am planning to move to Netherlands or Sweden due to better education and job opportunities
I left Greece in 2007 for University, totally thought I'd return after my studies but it turns out there are no jobs for me to return to
It sucks, I love the place, but I don't have the tolerance to work multiple low-paying unstable jobs at a time for years before finding something that pays me a living wage as a young person
Πάω στον θρόνο (I'm going to the throne)
Πάω για ξεφόρτωμα (I'll go unload)
I'm not sure I've heard any common ones, but I know that some people I know say this when they have to go to the bathroom
"Πάω να δημιουργήσω" (Pao na dimiourgiso)
Which means roughly "I'm going to create"
Πάω να στείλω ένα φαξ (pao na stealo ena fax) = Going to send a fax
Though, I don't know if this is standard or just an inside joke of my company of friends
There are a lot of expressions about shiting yourself in fear like "I'm shiting out potatoes" or "I'm shiting out soap bars"
There are also many expressions for diarrhoea like "I'm spilling juice" or "I'm spraying"
This is exactly what I was about to mention
It's by far my favorite euphemism
And yes, first time I heard it, I also took it literally
And yes, I did ask "Oh
I didn't know you had kids, how old are they
Cue stoner cackle (it was that kind of night)
We have "πάω στον πρόεδρο" in Greek, meaning 'I'm going to the president'.
Yes pretty common in Greece from the mid 70s onwards (before that we had a US backed military dictatorship in Greece so no soviet imports)
The typical LADA that you showed was always a great cheap car that could survive pretty much anything
The Niva (kinda jeep) is also very common especially for farmers
Not really but to this day you see a lot of old Lada Niva driving around
Yeah I guess because british cars are so much bett
hahaha ok I can't even finish this
Yeah I was about to say it looks a lot like the Niva we have here
One time, my Danish friend tried to cross the street on a pedestrian crossing and a car cut him off, nearly hitting him
He turned at me and said "That's illegal
He is obligated to let me cross the road by law"
Yeah surprise, buddy
Edit: typo
Every person from the Balkans has a similar story
My German friends were crossing not even looking if a car is coming
who even starts clubbing before 2 am
>“PUT ON YOUR FECKING SEAT BELT
Thanks for helping me read that in an Irish accent
>and it's really awkward
I felt that
Sometimes waiters are so underpaid they absolutely need tips
I used to work delivering food and I would be completely broke without tips
I don't think it needs to die, in Greece it's not obligatory tipping, people tip if they feel like it and that imo is a good gesture
The waiters get paid dirt cheap to begging with you might as well tip them a Euro
In my case, is government giving business owners the right to underpay employees by limiting basic salary to the bare minimum and raising taxes to the point certain stuff cost less even in Germany
Tips are considered a form of solidarity to a shitty financial situation
We agree to disagree
It's ok
Aww so romantic
Greece . More than 3500 years of practice :  [Greek fist fighters]
The first image is from an ancient mural 1500 B.C. at Santorini !
The second is a real photo from Greek Football Cup Final 2017 (P.A.O.K vs A.E.K.) - hooligans fight before the match !
(This was a photo-collage that went viral in Greece at 2017
Sometimes I feel i was born in the wrong country
I'm very very very different from the rest of Greeks
Same shit as you
I used to live in London for 6 years but now I came back and I live in an island, in a village
The trick to survival
I write people in my papars and I don't care
I realized after a few years in the UK that quality of life is subjective and happiness cannot be defined, and life in the UK, the culture was very distant to what I like
So, I moved back knowing the diffiulties (especially if you have lived abroad and opened your mind, it can be tricky), but like I said, I don't care what people think or say and I have managed to have a busy but quiet life with good weather and food
Some things are just irreplacable
"I write people in my papars" -> definitely still 100% greek
You could try asking r/Greek or even r/Greece for a good answer
Mostly religious and conservative but there is also a big percentage of more leftist people
Polarization is a big thing
It's not common at all, even among young people, with the exception of parties etc
Even then, the majority isn't drunk and it's considered especially immature for older people
Although we love alcohol, drinking responsibly is propably one of the few things we do right
You can go out on a Saturday night and the only wasted people you'll see are tourists
British tourists to be precise
pretty sure everyone thinks it's fun
young people from 18 to mid-twenties+ get drunk at parties regularly (some people if possible every saturday night)
and actual grown ups get drunk at weddings and such big celebrations
>But when people are falling over, fighting
One of your football players recently got arrested in Greece for drunkenly fighting with a cop
Our news mentioned that he said something about his "golden leg" too so
For most europeans religion is something that comes from tradition and you are not going to switch to a different church because they have a better PR campaign
So churches generally don't advertise
My experience in the US (Texas) was that people were considering different churches because they had better gym membership, daycare, zoos, aquarium, barbecues etc
These thoughts have literally never been associated with church in my country
Personally I am not religious, so I don't go to church, but all the people I know just go to the church in their neighborhood which is of the same denomination as their ancestors had (mostly orthodox in Greece, but few catholics exist as well)
Hellas- Have never seen one and am very surprised that such things exist
Never seen any of those, they look weird and funny lol
> different churches because they had better gym membership, daycare, zoos, aquarium, barbecues etc
Τι πράγμα;
Φαση αυτη η εκκλησια εχει μεσα γυμναστηριο και παιδικη χαρα, η αλλη εχει γηπεδα μπασκετ, η αλλη εχει ζωολογικο κηπο κ πανε εκδρομες, η αλλη εχει προγραμματα για εφηβους με ομαδες κλπ. Μεχρι μου ελεγε ο φιλος εκει πολλες εχουνε και fund για να δωσουν λεφτα αμα παθεις κατι κ χρειαζεσαι γιατρο (αφου αμερικα δεν εχει ασφαλιση)
Οταν γινεσαι μελος κανεις δηλωση ποσα βγαζεις κ σου βαζουνε μια μηνιαια συνδρομη ταριφα για τα εξοδα της εκκλησιας. Τα κτηρια τους μοιαζουνε σαν mall παρομοια με ΙΚΕΑ κλπ.
Απο αποψη του τι διδασκουνε, ειναι ολοι διαφορες παραλλαγες του προτεσταντισμού αλλά η καθεμια εχει τα δικά της χαρακτηριστικα. Ο φιλος εκει πχ ειναι μουσουλμανος αλλα μου ελεγε σκεφτεται να γραφτει σε μια εκκλησια γιατι εχει καλο γυμναστηριο και γηπεδα τενις κοντα του. Γενικα πολλη απο την υποδομη του κρατους την κανουνε οι εκκλησιες (αφου το κρατος ειδικα στο τεξας ειναι ανυπαρκτο)
Τι στον πουτσο ρε μλκ, ακούγεται σαν cult
μπιζνα ειναι τι ψάχνεις. Οι δικοι μας οι παπάδες ειναι δημοσιοι υπάλληλοι, εκει εχουνε ελευθερη αγορά και ο πιστος-καταναλωτής διαλέγει... οποτε παιζει πολυ το μαρκετινγκ και το τι προσφερει ο καθενας...
There are none - we don't share the same alphabet, let alone roots
Cypriots can understand Greek, and Greeks most of the time understand Cypriots unless they are using a heavy Cypriot Greek dialect with a lot of words that are not as common in the Greek mainland
I had friends in college from Cyprus that I could understand, but when I heard Cypriots speaking their dialect between them it was sometimes hard to follow
None except if you count Byzantine/medieval greek and ancient Greek as separate languages, then yes (In personally don't think of them as separate)
It's a pity dialects dont pass as languages, like Grico, Cretan, Cypriot, Pontic etc
Are you referring to Tsakonian
Hahaha true, [but yeah but no but yah
You're right it's so sad the language doesn't get enough recognition lately despite having survived that long
Alcohol, grilling meat, the family table, the shouting, name days, feta, olives and oil, fairs, calling each other Malaka, desire to reclaim Constantinupole
i would really love to have a sauna in my home, it's so relaxing, but sadly they are kinda rare here
Same in Greece I guess it's a Mediterranean thing lol
**Souvlaki** is the greek god you were never taught about in Mythology class
It's not that uncommon to display one outside your house (or on your balcony), or maybe keep one in storage for occasional use (sports events/ national holidays)
In my opinion a flag itselve is not a tell of whether or not someone is someone is a nationalist or not, there are other way more important signs that that
It's kinda odd unless it's a National Holiday ( 28 October, 25 March ) , but even then, it's not that common
People who do display the flag constantly are more often than not pretty right-wing
Also, there's usually no flags displayed inside gyms, schools/universities, restaurants etc
I dont think that's the case here
They have it because they share the same language with Greece, the culture, the religion, the customs and much more
(They wouldn't want to enosis with Greece because of the Greek debt situation, moreover their constitution, doesn't allow enosis with no country)
A good recent photo is [this one] of a Greek soldier in the Greco-Italian war (ww2) smiling, really showing how the Greeks felt about the war
But the one every single Greek absolutely knows is [this one] from the third siege of Messologhi from the revolution of 1821
I've always wondered the story behind this photograph
Who was the girl
Was it staged
Lmao you're right he was asking for *photographs* I just couldn't think of anything else that every Greek would know
I personally hate the final exams of high school
You have to study 24/7 (I am not kidding) for you to get a 12/20 grade
My cousin's hair fall down constantly because of the pressure and she can't even have fun (she gets 15 minutes out of 24 hours to relax)
Meanwhile, our government passed a law which says both (paid) colleges and public (free) universities are equal now
Let me clarify that he children in colleges don't get to go through this (€€€€€)
Greece is the only country who invests the least GDP compared to all european countries
You also have to pay for frontistririo which is a second school, so you get to study double the amount cause our educational system is lame
That's why we are not educated properly, we are some of the worst drivers ever and we are generally a corrupt community
Sorry for the rant but I had to let it out
Edit from comment: Now I get it
I was confused about private schools and colleges
Excuse me for my wrongdoing, I meant that children can get in a college without the exams, by paying, while us in public/private schools have to give them
Everyone thinks they know everything better than anyone else, the sense of entitlement and disrespect for the rest and the quality of urban infrastructure and life (no green spaces, bad or non-existent pavements, cars parked on literally everything, extremely poorly designed road network and increasingly old buildings)
Also a manic clenching to the past while not actually following the ancients' examples
Guys with €€€ have been already sending their children to private universities for decades now, just in other countries
It's free GDP that Greece has been losing because of our stubborness against private universities
Also, try finding a European country in which private universities are not officially recognized
You won't find any
That said, I totally feel your pain, I passed through the same shit myself with the national exams
It's just a matter of economics
If something is sought after so much (eg Medicine) it will be hard getting in
Stop spreading misinformation
Students of private schools take the Panhellenic exams and the final exams every year for six years
They will never know how earning your money with modern skills feels like, and be able to go above the back-breaking labour that uneducated illegal immigrants can do for half the price
I felt that
Ok I may have said it in a wrong way but you get my point, it is still unfair
Edit: I am not actually saying those at private schools don't have to pass the exams, what I was referring to is that these kids don't have to worry the same and they have a lot more ease getting to a university
Edit 2: Now I get it
I was confused about private schools and colleges
Excuse me for my wrongdoing, I meant that children can get in a college without the exams, by paying, while us in public/private schools have to give them
Europe was not at war with itself
It was not a civil war
Europe consists of many different countries and cultures that have been in war far longer that they have been in peace
And still a lot of Euro countries have disagreements and conflicts that thankfully don't devolve into war
European consolidation and unity are relevantly recent ideas
> and we have the biggest military surplus company in Europe
Varusteleka
This is a weird fact
It's not uncommon to use fingers as a measure of length, usually in the hairdressers
It's not exactly traditional, but it doesn't adhere to some specific measuring system
It is, like the name suggests, the thickness of a finger and it usually equals half an inch, or one and a half centimeters
Came here to say okka(=1
3kg) and drami (=3
2gr)
Drami is still somewhat used traditionally in bottles of ouzo, tsipouro and raki
It is not unusual for example to still ask for a "*κατοσταράκι"* (katostaraki), which is a bottle of 100 dramia, or 320gr
That's a pretty big assumption
Let's say you have [this stud] in front of you for example
The dick has a mind of its own
I used to hate [rebetiko] which is a Greek traditional genre of music
When I was younger, I always felt it was too "heavy" for me, probably because most of the songs are about drugs and poverty
Now I love it
I think it describes exceptionally what it is to be forced into crime in order to survive
It is an essential part of the modem Greek spirit
Fucking hell with the soup
Every
Single
Meal
I'm tired of eating it hahah
Both pronunciations are used, the latter more common amongst older generations
Maybe, I hear both much
Starting from our ancient history, I'd say its something like:
Persia (Iran)
Egypt
Italy
Ottoman Empire (Turkey)
Western Roman Empire (Western European countries)
In our modern history though:
Turkey
Germany
Italy
Russia
Cyprus
Bulgaria is an option, too
Turkey, 2
Egypt, 3
Italy, 4
Cyprus, 5
Bulgaria
1 Turkey
2 Italy
3 Iran
4 Bulgaria
5 Egypt
Honorable mentions: France, Russia, UK and Lebanon (Phoenicians), Armenia, Syria also
Turkey (Ottoman Period), Italy (Roman Empire mostly), Bulgaria (since they interacted a lot with the Byzantine Empire), Iran (ancient Persia) and the 5th would probably be Egypt (ancient Egypt and Ptolemaic Egypt)
I'd swap out Russia for Bulgaria
Surprised with putting us so low
I had better expectations from our relationship
It's 50/50
Russia played a critical role during and after the Revolution
Surely it's a large chapter in our history but I couldn't recall any related information so I chose to exclude it
I had it in mind but I'm not really sure which modern country they represent
If you want my opinion I'd say they were Greeks but many will have objections about it
I'm curious about your username
That could be enough of a pain in the arse for games to remove gambling mechanics and heavily monetize other aspects
because the rest of the world is becoming big, federalization is the only way to go
If people move to rural areas, then rural areas will become cities
But is it really 51 years worth of progress
Wright brothers to moon landing felt much more grand
I'll have to go with Cyprus
Although southern Italy is pretty much the same as us except for the language
I suppose Cyprus
We speak the same language, many people go over there to study, and you can even choose to join that army instead of the Greek one
After that, probably Italy, we have very similar cultures, share history, same weather
Greece & Cyprus for sure
But we also consider Serbians our brothers :)
i'd say Cyprus, we speak the same language but they have a funny accent
and most of the time Cyprus seems like an extension of Greece
Well I would say Italy and maybe Spain
Maaaayyyyyyyybeeeeeeee Turkey as well, sure we are both against each other but we also help each other some times
altho this depends on the person
Cyprus obviously, but it feels weird to even call it a brother country, many here in Greece think of Cyprus and Greece as being one in the same
I'd say the same kardesim
I've lived all around the Balkans, and spent some time in western Turkey, and all I see is the same traditions, behaviors, insecurities
I think we should all just grow up and realize just how similar we all are, and make our own union (let's call it the Eastern Union, EU haha), with blackjack hookers and raki
\*Cries in Greek\*
Hug me brotha
Why don't you play with the nighbour's kid
The neighbour's kid: America
To my knowledge it's originaly a South Italian saying and not a Greek one, if that answers your question
Yeah, it's quite embarrassing tbh, you have a total shit song not even you would vote for and you still get the maximum points just because you're related
Well, many others did the exact same and it was the main reason I stopped watching it, it had become politics instead of a song contest
It's ok we can be friends in secret
Lots of my friends are from Albania, I even visited once
\*sad coffee sip\*
Aren't we worthy of the qifsha ropt award 2020
> Lolllll I was going to say Greece but I felt like I was going to be attacked by nationalists
I think I haven't seen anyone act hostile to Albanians for years and that makes me quite happy
We love y'all and you know it <3
Tell it to other Greek guy on this thread fratello, who doesn't belive me hahaha
Yeah, the venetians suck big time :p
If Greeks were more hostile towards Venetians it would probably be more for the Sack fo Constantinople in 1204, which was instigated by the Doge himself, and had insane effects in the next centuries,  than the Parthenon, which was horrible, but was one General doing his general things and except from the monumental loss, it didn't effect Greeks that much
But Greeks arent, Venice as a seperate entity havent been relevant for centuries in Greece, plus the areas occupied by them, or Italy after the unification had it way better than the places the Ottomans had
Well it's actually written as "una faccia una razza" and no Greek would write it that way
But despite its origins I can assure you from my own experience that Italians use it too and very often when interfering with Greeks ;)
I was joking about the Venice part, all Italians are the same to us and there are no grudges
We most definitely prefer Italian tourists to any other, cause you're exactly as loud as we are when having conversations therefore no one gets annoyed
OK, you're a little louder then us I have to admit
Correct
It's αδερφή (sister) and αδερφός (brother) even today, not just in old Greek ;)
Scusi sorella
(I hope I wrote it correctly)
Well I'm telling you my first hand experience, which btw was in Italy and not Greece and you still won't believe me, and not only that but you found an excuse for me hearing it, that it's apparently a tourism industry trick
As if I'm somehow retarded
I mean wtf
I hate to disappoint you but the loudest man-made noise I've ever witnessed was when a school from Italy came through a ferry ship  terminal in Greece,  don't ask me where they were from in Italy cause it was to loud to ask but definitely not southerners cause they were waiting for the ferry to Ancona
Even Greeks got annoyed, imagine that ;p
>I hope with the other greek guy in the other comment you didn’t say i was annoying because i pointed out i’m not a guy (i don’t speak greek)
What
No, nothing like that
I don't know where you're from in Greece but I'm from the Ionian coast, we see more Italians then Greeks here
It's like e.g. you living in Portland and telling me something about Seattle and I (who btw live on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean) won't believe you cause I would prefer to hear it from someone that lives in Washington State
It's not something important, like nuclear launch codes, just an expression people in Seattle use
Now, why the fck would I lie about somethig like that
Well, In Greece there's loud and quite ones everywhere, we're not bound by coordinates on a map ;p
Well I don't know where you lived in Italy but if it was north of Napoli you propably wouldn't have heard it, also for starters people need to know that you're Greek to say it
I've visited plenty of times, Campania, Apulia and southwards and heard it every time, never heard it in Venice, Florence and Milan though
>PS: for our fellow Europeans: We aren't fighting here, we are just solving an argument in the Greek way
Can confirm
Now that's very un-Greek of you, I'm offended
Lmao
OK, that's a good reason
No soy hispanohablante nativo pero he aprendido español
Cuando estaba en Brasil podía entender mucho del portugues escrito, pero no entendía ni papa de las conversaciones
Parecía ruso
Carthago delenda est
We do this too
I'd rather use the old flag, just a white cross on a blue background
White cross over a blue back round and the golden Byzantine eagle that our churches use on top
It'd be lit
I'd take out the cross
It's a leftover religious symbol and I don't like it
I like the colour though
I would find a way to incorporate the old flag (with just the cross) With a doubleheaded eagle or the Vergina Sun
Yellow and black should be on the flag outside of blue and white
I would go back to the pre-1978 flag, which has only a white cross in a light blue backround
i'd make the blue dark af and leave it at that, maybe design a better naval jack or a COA tho
I would go back to the darker version because it looked cooler, not because of the dictatorship
Me too
I love your flag's colors
Best flag imo
Idk considering that religion here is more like history than actual religion and anyways it doesnt stand out as much as the Muslim symbol it is pretty ok
I totally agree, but can't figure out what to put in its place
How do you make this
We have built the society around religion
Churches don't pay taxes, children are indoctrinated in the religion and the church has a say in so many aspects of everyday life that I refuse to see it as a harmless symbol
It stands to remind everyone that Greece is orthodoxy and orthodoxy is Greece
Also it's a very boring symbol
At least the crescent moon and star are nice shapes
A souvlaki
Christianity, whether you believe in it or not, is the reason Greece is free today
If the revolutionaries in 1821 didn't rally behind God, freeing this country would not have worked
As Theodoros Koloktronis said "We fight firstly for our God and then for our land" which is why the Cross has been on every Greek flag since that time
The meaning is more historic than religious
I would never remove it
Yes indeed many of these are true but I dont think it reminds anyone that Greece is orthodoxy Switzerland has also a cross on the flag and I never even gave attention to it
I personally think it blends in very well in a design with lines and generally it remains discrete and nice
This is clearly not what I meant lol
Σωστοοος.... μια τριήρης
I mean, it's just an opinion so I wouldn't expect us to be 100% in agreement
I can't answer on the Switzerland part as I have no view on how it affects Swiss people and how they feel about it
That's just how I've always felt about our flag
We Greeks tend to live with our parents up until the day we move out to live with our SO (that's not the case for all Greeks, of course, but it's pretty common)
Most of us don't even contribute a penny while staying with them, unless they deal with financial problems (rarely a Greek parent would ask from his/her kid to chip in even if they dealt with financial problems)
I'm not talking about the last 10 years which have been harsh on our economy; it was a well established practice even before that
First time I heard (many years ago) that this wasn't the case in other countries, I thought that the whole world was weird
If you ask me now, in my forties, I think that we are the weird ones (and every other nation that does the same)
Sure, you always have a safety net, but then it's exactly that, you have a safety net that becomes your comfort zone from which you never wish to step out
It's debilitating
To answer your question, no, it's not normal in Greece
Normally, it isn't even expected of you to contribute to the expenses (food, bills)
That's a joke we Southerners like to do for Germans and other western countries
Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus are countries family centered
Though unemployment plays a huge role in all that
It's very difficult to run a house by yourself though if the kids are working they contribute to the family's budget
I would say the opposite happens, meaning parents trying to keep their kids at home for as long as they can
Some islands have mascot animals, e.g. Mykonos IIRC traditionally has pelicans - the original was called Peter
There was also a monk seal mascot for Samos, but that poor thing was killed
Two flipping wolves and people start panicking, sad indeed,
they say it sounds like Spanish and that it is very hard
Some people say it sounds Portuguese and I thank them
Someone said my Greek accent sounds Arabic and I haven't spoken to him since
It is like a hard version of Dutch and an ugly version of Norwegian
I fucking love Danish, it definitely does sound smooth and melodic to me as well
I usually get it though
It may help that I have a half Cypriot half Greek friend
That's me but with Cypriots
tbh I could probably imitate a perfect Spanish accent by only slightly modifying my Greek accent
Yeah that's what I'm saying, Cypriots can perfectly understand "clean" Greek but the average Greek can't understand Cypriot Greek
It's most probably what you said, Cypriots are exposed to Greek media whereas all that Greeks have from Cyprus is a well known youtuber who just speaks standard Greek with an accent lol
Thank you Finland for the great music
I want to thank Turkey for sending millions of refugees to Greece crippling our already bad economy even more, and calling us the bad guys when we deny passage to the refugees
Thanks Erdogan
Don't forget the friendly game between AEK athens "against" Partizan to send a message to the world when the bombings from NATO took place in your country when everyone else was afraid to even talk about it and even more to go to your country
Always love for our orthodox brothers
No not really, we only lock if we'll be gone for a N extended period of time, more than a day
I have friends though that do that but it's considered a bit too much from my experience
I usually don't, it's not like it opens from the outside anyways
I always lock it at night though, and the door of the building gets locked after 11pm too
Τζον μέιντ χιζ γουέι του ε τάβερν θρου δε νταρκ φόρεστ, όνλι του φάιντ άουτ δατ χι φοργκότ δε μάνι.
It's rough though cause Greek has 5 vowels and English has like 89
Modern Greek script:
Τζων μεϊντ χιζ γουέυ του ε τάβερν θρου δε ντάρκ φόρεστ, όουνλυ του φαϊντ άουτ δατ χη φοργκότ δε μάνυ
greek: Τζον μέιντ χιζ ουέι του ε τάβερν θρου δε νταρκ φόρεστ, όνλυ του φάινντ άουτ δατ χι φοργκότ δε μάνυ
In Greek it would look like this:
Τζον μεϊντ χις ουεϊ του εϊ ταβερν θρου δε νταρκ φορεστ, ονλη του φαϊνντ αουτ δατ χη φοργκοτ χεις μονυ.
it would probably go like "Τζόν μέιντ χις γουέι το ε τάβερν θρο δε ντάρκ φόρεστ, όνλι του φάιντ άουτ δατ χι φοργκότ δε μάνι"
A roughly translation is the following :
Ο Γιάννης, περνώντας μέσα από το σκοτεινό δάσος, πηγαίνοντας στην ταβέρνα, ανακάλυψε ότι ξέχασε τα χρήματα.
Obviously Covid is widely discussed, since we're also heading for the second wave, and new measures have recently been enforced
Other than that, we also have:
* The aftermath of the [Golden Dawn trial] (officially recognised far-right criminal organisation that used to function as a political party)
The final sentencing of the members and their arrests
The fact that their second in command (Christos Pappas) managed to escape police custody and still hasn't been caught, despite the fact that everyone was [assudered] such thing could never happen
* Our [maritime border with Turkey] I won't get too much into that because I've missed some of the newer updates, but it's a topic that I constantly see trending
Turkish aggression
Covid Pandemic
The new legislation revising the bankruptcy code
The Golden Dawn trial is still being talked about a lot
I think these issues currently ranking at the top at that order too
Last year it was the exact opposite
October came and it was still summer
> since we're also heading for the second wave
I'm no epidemiologist but hasn't the second wave already hit us in the face with a hammer with thorns
That's what I'd think too, but everyone on the news keeps talking about how we're "close" to the second wave, what can I say
Damn that's kinda sad tbh, hope that in some way you find a way to improve your mood and find time to enjoy the things you ~~lowe~~ love
EDIT: autocorrect
Hope your life improves
Oh how magnanimous, ~~defending~~  wishing well to people while undermining their ~~age~~ nationality
I don't know why are you so hostile man, I really hope your life improves
Thanks but we are good, the fine people in Germany have used your loans to them to loan us good
We aren't giving them back though, so good luck to your boys getting them from them I guess
Since you specified law schools , it's the Nation and Kapodistrian University of Athens' School of Law ,for 2020 it was among the 300 best law schools internationally
[Also a team of students managed to win even against Harvard in 2015]
If you want technical universities, the best is National Technical School of Athens,their Civil Engineering school is 11th in Europe, their other schools are very good,too
I'd say university of Crete has some of the best departments
If you ask humble people who know their stuff they'll tell you so
If you ask faculty members they will scoff and pretend that other universities other than theirs don't exist
Albania, Serbia, BiH & Montenegro
Generally i never really cared for those countries
I spent a day in Bratislava back in 2015, I absolutely loved it
Our stay there was part of a school trip that saw us visiting Austria, then Hungary, then Slovakia, in order to catch a cheaper flight from there back to Athens
To me, the fact that it seemed rather neat and contained was a breath of fresh air, honestly
A few interesting buildings here and there, quiet streets you could get lost in, everything I could ever ask for
Also had some great food in the city square (or whatever the restaurant was)
I felt that the service was the warmest we had received throughout the entire trip too, everyone was just so nice
It's a great alternative to more tourist-trap-y destinations in the neighborhood, since you can see similar sites and architecture (even at a smaller scale), while also enjoying a more relaxed holiday
In short, a perfect destination for travelers like me, who prefer more off the grid stuff
I used to say back then, that among the three countries we'd visited, I'd work in Austria, retire in Slovakia, then travel to Hungary for the holidays
Jesus Christ, we went on exactly the same trip in 12th grade and I’d say that Slovakia was absolutely the highlight
"Empathy" (ἐμπάθεια) in Greek means hostility, and is a pseudo-cognate word as it means roughly the opposite in each language
>since feces are the most disgusting thing in the world
Hey man not cool
Everyone likes what they like what is your problem
I remember a British aquaintance had to explain to me that when he said "this is very interesting" he meant exactly the opposite
Apparently he realized I kept misunderstanding him
Modern Greece was born in corruption
The rest of you merely adopted it
Let's just say you can rate your country in a scale of 1 to mine
As a Greek I feel I am very close to the top
Salutes to our Romanian, Serbian, Albanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian and Serbian brothers, btw, Balkans rule in this thread
I can’t really pick but in my opinion it is one of those:
[Όταν έρχονται τα σύννεφα by Manos Chatzidakis]
[Ένα το Χελιδόνι by Mikis Theodorakis]
[Το Ζεϊμπέκικο της Ευδοκίας by Manos Loizos]
This is about preference so it's purely subjective
Maybe it's a cliché but for a reason [Sirtaki - Mikis Theodorakis]
Hans Zimmer is amazing
Thank you my friend, hope for peace
Well, i can’t say I agree with you but it’s indeed a good song
Life is fine, I have everything near me, city is ugly af
I come from kalamata but live in Athens
I get shivers when I have to visit a friend if there are buses involved
The suburbs are nice though, basically me and everyone I know try to avoid the center and live/hang out only in Glyfada, voula vouliagmeni, kifissia etc
Athens right
Ugliest city I've ever been so far
Suburbs are lit
Center and big municipalities are shit
Our cities are not ugly, Athens is
Just look it up on r/urbanhell
Athens
Thessaloniki is nice from what I've heard
Lol, hi Maria, Elena, Kosta and Giorgo
Born and raised in a very busy municipality and having been across Athens and it's suburbs, I can say that the city itself, especially the center is tragic for the prestige it's associated with
The suburbs are nice though
Athens-Thessaloniki rivalry is a classic
Dad with a couple of Athenian friends had their car windows smashed at some point in the 80s I believe during a trip there
But things are chill now and it's mostly calling each other idiots for "misnaming" things
Hey, as long as they also have a plan to stop equipment looting, I'm all for it
usually its the province of atlantis but the joke went too far ...
> Atlantic
the name comes from ATLAS a titan in greek mythology
this site  is one of the hypothetical locations of atlantis

The whole souvlaki/gyro naming dispute
In athens, where I'm from, we call the pita-wrap-dish souvlaki and the meat-on-a-stick-dish we call kalamaki (which literally means straw)
I am not sure about the south of Greece, but I know that in the North they call the wrap a "pitogyro" and the meat stick a "souvlaki", so it is a very big debate between regions of Greece whether if the pita wrap thing is called a "souvlaki" or a "pitogyro" and if the meat stick thing is called a "souvlaki" or "kalamaki". So basically here in Athens at least, when we say souvlaki we mean the wrap, and in the north of Greece when they say souvlaki they mean the stick, and the term "kalamaki" for the stick does not exist there either
&#x200B;
I want to order a souvlaki now
(the wrap kind :\] )
You could also add people from Thessaloniki calling all "pita" as "bugatsa".
Have you checked its underside
Or all yellow cheeses "kaséri"
I'm not sure I completely understand your question, but in Greek the singular form is Gyros/Gyro, our plural is not like in English, so we don't put an "s" to make things plural
In Greek there are different forms of the singular of a word actually, and I'm not a linguistics expert so I don't really know how to explain it well,
If you want to say, "I want a gyro" you would say "Θέλω έναν γύρο" (Thelo enan gyro) without an "s",
But if you want to say "My favourite food is gyro" you would say "Το αγαπημένο μου φαγητό είναι ο γύρος" (my favourite food is gyros) with an "s".
This is similar to names in Greek, in English it's always "Sokrates" and "Platonas" for example, but in Greek if you are speaking directly to someone, you would say "Hey Sokrati/Platona" with no s, but if you were speaking about them in the third person, you would say "Ο Σωκράτης/Πλάτωνας είναι μαλάκας" (Sokratis/Platonas is an asshole) with an s, idk why this example with asshole came to my mind, but whatever hahaha
I hope this makes some sense(?)
Hmmm
I'd say you need to learn a foreign language because if you don't you are pretty much stuck at home
Also us smaller countries don't have the same air and sound pollution compared to other bigger cities
Hippopotamus=Ιπποπόταμος (Hippopótamos) River horse
Giraffe=Καμηλοπάρδαλη (Kamilopárdali) spotted camel
Leopard=Λεοπάρδαλη (leopárdali) spotted lion
Mole=τυφλοπόντικας(tyflopóntikas) blind mouse
Those are of the top of my head
And a cool one to balance it:
Bat=Νυχτερίδα (Nychterída) daughter of the night I think
(Edit:added more)
I don't think Νυχτεριδα means that, it may come from Νυξ the goddess of the night (daughter of Chaos), but that is a long path to Νυχτεριδα with many other meanings in between
&#x200B;
Do you have any source
but anteater = μυρμηγκοφάγος (anteater) :D
Some more:
&#x200B;
hedgehog (σκαντζόχοιρος) = thorned pig
guinea fowl (φραγκόκοτα) = Franks' chicken
weasel (νυφίτσα) = little Nymph
mussel (μύδι) = little mouse
squid (καλαμάρι) = inkwell
octopus (χταπόδι) = eight-foot
centipede (σαρανταποδαρούσα) = forty-feeted
rose chaffer (χρυσόμυγα) = goldfly
earwig (ψαλίδα) = clippers
mantis (αλογάκι της Παναγίας) = Virgin Mary's horse
PS: Not stupid names, just literal
No that's why I said" I think", I know that the suffix -Ίδα/-ιδας means son/daughter of (hence leonidas means Lion's son) so I figured that's what it meant but I'm in no way sure of it, I tried to google it but nothing helpful came up
>Hippopotamus
It also literally means river horse (comes from greek)
Sin Boy - Mama
Hawk - Caliente
And now Konstantinos Argyros - Athina mou
[This] came to mind
I think you won't get unanimous answers
Really
Ok, look for Μαρίνα Σάττι - Μάντισσα in yt, maybe you 'll find an alternative videolink you can watch
The subway of Thessaloniki begun construction in 1986
It is still being built
The subway in Greece's second largest city, Thessaloniki
They started construction on it in 2006
Guess what
Still not operational
It's a running joke in Greece
There cant be any badly executed public projects if the projects themselves get stuck in standard bureocratic procedures for a decade or two
Thank us later
I have been to Romania and was a passenger in a car travelling cross-country
100% feared for my life and would never visit a romanian road again
Never understood why Londoners feel so cosmopolitan and smug compared to the rest of the country when they literally voted for 8 years of Boris as mayor
I still believe
Oh yes the ID card issue is huge
I feel ashamed every time I go abroad and they see my ID card at an airport
Almost everyone laughs
Story in English
The Greek way
That's why you pay ~€86 for the privilege of having a passport for 5 years, and a document that isn't a complete mess
But then the cover is only in Greek
Last I checked, Ελληνική Δημοκρατία doesn't look like anything to most people
You just can't win
It has happened to me multiple times, but people never seem to notice the english on the id card
I've been asked if that is the Cyrillic alphabet
I have argued so many times on airports, insisting that there is in fact english on my ID
They never seem to notice
It isn't exactly cheap and definitely not a good investment for people that don't travel that often
[An example]
Which is why I was being sarcastic
It's the only identification document that's more presentable and it costs €86 for an amazing 5 whole years
I just can't fathom the reason for the 5 year period
It's kinda nice not having to pull out the old "flash card laminated in a 20 year old elementary school faculty room laminator" ID card you know
Too bad it's a pretty hefty charge
I just wanted to weed out any possibility of your comment not being sarcastic tbh but yeah, mentioning the cost and duration of the passport is the second reason people laugh about in airports
And no expiry date
Mine was issued in 2008 when I was in my preteens
Guess who gets to know the immigration police officers better every time
Not really
Other than masks, supermarkets are good
In greek it could be Φιλότιμο - filotimo
The Word literally means friend of honor, and is used to descripe that we deeply care about something
Malaka
It is a word describing immense beauty and the freedom of happiness
_Beautiful Greek Words:_
πνεύμα, rough (pronounced:pnévma) which means spirit, soul
αήρ (aír) or in Modern Greek, αέρας (aéras), the air
απόκοσμος (apókosmos), something that doesn't relate or doesn't come from our world, but from another one, smth mysterious, strange or heavenly and wonderful
αλεξιθυμία (alexithimía) this word describes the people that have a difficult time understanding feelings in general and expressing their feelings
κάθαρση (kátharsi), catharsis
σκιαμαχία (skiamahía) fighting an invisible, non-existent enemy, literally: a fight with shadows
μεράκι (meráki) is the very intense/strong love, passion and care about smth, about an activity like work
Example: An entrepreneur is working with much meráki
He works with much passion and is enjoying his job
ευδαιμονία (efdemonía) the continuous psychic relaxation
νόστος (nóstos) to express our return home after a long absent from our homeland
νοσταλγία (nostalgía) from the word νόστος + άλγος (álgos) = pain
It is borrowed into English from Greek as nostalgia
δέος (déos) is  excitement, followed by feelings of fear or worry for something that exceeds our strength
φωτοσβέστης (photosvéstis), the "enemy" of progress and learning, the obscurantist
μέντωρ or μέντωρας  (méntor(as)) or in English, the mentor
θάλασσα (sea - thalassa) or σύννεφο (cloud -sinnefo)
Maybe not with a deep meaning, but I love the way they sound
+1 το έψαχνα
Sike
It means wanker
Yeah that's correct
Happy to help if it's all Greek to you and you need clarifications or explanations
By the way,  the correct way of saying it as an abjective is:
filotimos masculine singular
filotimi masculine plural
filotimi feminine singular
filotimes feminine plural
filotimo neutral singular
filotima neutral plural
And then we have, filotimo as a noun
I don't know if you really care about it, but whatever
I mean, technically, no doubt, it translates to wanker
But much to my surprise as well, the comment is not entiiirely wrong (???)
Like, when you're in complete awe or when you're finally free of a huge burden or when you have this small moment of appreciation and happiness, just taking a breath and letting it out with a "malaaaka" feels quite cathartic
Everyday malakía
Wait, they're called Bergsmannsheil instead of Krakenhaus
Yup exactly
Thinking about it briefly, it can apply to most situations where fuck is used as an exclamation, plus if you wanna say to sb "cut it out/stop nagging me", or as a disapproving "are you serious
" or if there is sth really wholesome going on (of course in an extremely informal environment)
And it's most definitely known as the insult, it's on the same level as "asshole" I'd say, but it's also commonly used in as "dude/bro" between friends
Not particularly ugly but there's a girl in my class named Νεονίλλη (Neonilli)
I haven't heard a name like this before
Also: Αλέκος (Alekos), it's supposed to be a derivative of Alexander but to me it sounds like the Greek equivalent of a redneck
I've seen other people say this but any American-ish names i sort of dislike, they just sound wrong for a Greek person
I dislike most ancient Greek names, some are ok like Aristoteles or Alexandros but there are some really weird ones that just don't fit in with modern Greek
male: Χρυσοβαλάντης (Chrysovalántis)
female: Αφροξυλάνθη (Afroxylánthi)
Both sound way worse if you're greek
I believe the worst native name from my country is probably "  Σεραφείμ "
German names are so cool though
Νεονίλλη?!?!?!?!?!? Weird name
I think Afroxylánthi doesnt exist it was made up as a really ugly and weird name
Just googled it found nothing about it being real or not
Arsenios, Chrysanthos, Kleopatra, Demosthenes, Eugenios, Ektoras, Ermes, Hieronymos, Isidora, Iasonas, Kassandra, Nestoras, Prometheas, Solon, Xanthippe, Socrates
Almost all modern Greek names have some roots in ancient Greek, but most weren't used that much unlike these names
A simple google search for "Afroksylanthi" turned up a couple facebook profiles of people named Afroxylanthi, a Wiktionary article about the name and a slang
gr article about the idiomatic uses the absurdity of that name has produced
the facebook profiles seem to be ironic, the [slang
gr] article contains this " Υποθέτω πως είναι η κόρη της [κυρα-περμαθούλας] και ανηψιά της [θεία-Φωτούλας]  που την έχουν κλείσει στον μικρόκοσμο κάποιου νησιού ή χωριού να έχει  άσπρη αφράτη επιδερμίδα, και φροντίζουν αυτές για το συνοικέσιο." and the wiktionary article says almost nothing (I mean if the name was real at least a dictionary would know something more about it)
So almost nothing
We inverted Democracy in Ancient Greece
In recent times Frappe
Tbh I cant choose but there are a lot
Ancient Greece : Water Mill
The Odometer
The Alarm Clock
artography
Olympics
Basis of Geometry
Earliest Practice of Medicine
Modern Philosophy
Medieval Greece(byzantine empire):  Flamethrower
Grenade
Greek Fire
Pendentive dome
Counterweight trebuchet
Hand-trebuchet
Pointed arch bridge
Modern Greece (19th century until today) : Mini, caller id, BlackBerry
[(Source)]
Pap smears from George Papanikolaou and according to wikipedia caller ID
i mean
Democracy ,philosophy many sciences ,the fact that the Earth was round
i don't have time to list all of the but you get the picture
Many Greeks have already commented but I just want to add the vending machine and the antikythera mechanism (or any other astronomical automatic mechanism), as well as the first ticking clock and central heating
Also, astrology
Sorry for that
This is a hard question, but probably, the steam engine, democracy, geography, the crane, central heating, showers and underground sewer systems would be some of the top Inventions
Ancient Greece : Democracy and a lot of science-math-literature-art parts
Eastern Roman empire: Hagia Sofia which defined the Orthodox church's architecture, Greek fire which was a type of flamethrower that wasn't extinguished by water and we still don't know how it was made
Modern Greece : the pap test which is the most accurate test for cervical cancer
Worst invention : Pizza with pineapple
maybe democracy or olympic games
maybe gyros with tzatziki
We've made a lot of discoveries and inventions but I I would choose the Olympic Games
Then the stupid Romans came along, and introduced us to women
We're still hanging around tho, much to many people's dismay
Bloody monsters
Only if you have a generous amount of oil in exchange for that F R E E D O M
Ah yes, the beauty of the european borders
Swedes get drunk in Denmark, Bulgarians get drunk in Greece and Brits get drunk everywhere :)
In Greece, we used the term Δωσίλογος (Dosilogos) to describe a traitor during the nazi occupation of the country
&#x200B;
It's a combination of the words δώσω (I will/to give) and λόγος (speech/reason)
It literally means a man who must speak for his actions as in the man who will be held responsible for his actions
&#x200B;
OK, I was born in 1996, so I can't tell you about before but during the financial crisis that we went through the last decade, the term was used broadly against the politicians who supported austerity measures
in Greece it's not very common but when someone rats you out you tell them "the Germans are our friends right
my dad and Grandpa (grandpa fought in the battle of Crete) use the phrase "Οι Γερμανοί ειναι φίλοι μας ε?" (The Germans are our friends right
I think κουκουλοφόρος (koulouloforos, literally meaning "he who wears a hood") is still used as well
The term came to meaning "traitor" during the occupation because collaborators would wear hoods when identifying suspects
It's still used to describe someone who has betrayed you, especially if he did it behind your back
There's also the term «Τσολάκογλου/Tsolakoglou», the surname of the collaborationist PM
It's the equivalent of Quisling, but only meant for high class people (eg the PMs that have signed the bailouts, in recent times)
Quite the offensive word
We also use Germanotsoliades (Γερμανοτσολιάδες) or Tagmatasfalites (Ταγματασφαλίτες) portmanteaus for members of  the ["Security Battalions"] paramilitary counter-guerilla forces the Germans set up with Greek volunteers, and sent them to fight the Communist-led partisans
They committed many atrocities, and unfortunately many were left untouched post war a
or even used by the new western affiliated Greek government ,  which was afraid of a communist take over, and with the tacit support of the British went into a period of White terror that was the final trigger for the Greek civil war
It is similar to how many former Wermacht officers were not touched by the Allies so they could prop up West Germany's armies so it could be a bulwark for East Germany and the Soviets
It is a very dark page in Greek history and it is *very* divisive even today
This phrase is actually a misquote (perhaps the most famous greek misquote) from the movie Η Χαραυγή της Νίκης (Dawn of Victory) of 1971
The actual quote doesn't say "Οι Γερμανοί είναι φίλοι μας" but "Μας αγαπάνε οι Γερμανοί, σαν φίλοι έρχονται" (The Germans love us, they come as friends)
It takes place on a scene when a Greek favored by the Nazis tries to convince the villagers of a Cretan village to give up the resistance members hiding among them
When they refuse the Germans execute them all
My Dad is Cretan so that would explain it
the thought of a person like that makes me want to shoot someone
I feel you
I tried it with German, and people would be anxious to help me and instantly switch to English
I realised I used to do it too, so now I just ask if English would be more convenient
I think you would be quite within your rights to ask if they'd mind using <language> because you'd like to practise
Αλλιώς, υπάρχει και το Reddit
I used to live in the UK for some time and I love British English more than American English
I won't say much on that because it may come out as me hating on Americans which is not my intention
I will however say that I've worked for a few small businesses in my time and I've made a point to switch the English part of their websites to the UK version instead of American, from translations down to the little flag
Μπράβο, καλή επιτυχία!
Ok here is some perspective from a non native speaker: American English is easier to pick up, because of the vast resources: many movies, series, songs, etc
In Greece (and I'd imagine many other European countries) there are mainly two institutions offering certification of proficiency, the university of Cambridge, and the university of Michigan
What happens is that the format of the first is harder than the second, as it has many different exercises, whereas the one from Michigan is multiple choice+essay+speaking, so most teachers will encourage going for Michigan
Furthermore it's cheaper
I can't tell you exact prices because I took mine about 13 years ago
On the cockiness
Does BE sound more cocky than AE to a non-native
Yes definitely
Do I care
Not at all, I love sounding cocky
I love the main accent, and every single accent associated with the UK
Surprisingly though, the biggest problem when someone tries to speak BE (again as a non native) is not picking up the accent, but distinguishing the words and expressions that are common in BE
Also I think BSL is cooler than ASL
The Darkfall MMO probably
All other games have been war simulators or stuff like that, which although some are highly rated, they're pretty niche
I think it's pretty popular here
It's one of my favorite series and I just have to say it gets even better in the next seasons
I'd like to thank Bulgaria for letting bygones be bygones and moving on
Thank you Bulgaria, because is Greeks can go there and buy things for really cheap
Thank you all for not letting our country die, I guess
ex yugoslavia left the thread
Thank you Turkey for the coffee and narghile, thank you Bulgaria for doing most of the hard fighting during the Balkan Wars, thank you North Macedonia for cevapcici and ajvar which I hope to one day see in a Greek restaurant, thank you Albania for having the chillest migrants in Greece
I'd like to think our participation in the European Union helped our relationship
Maybe in the future if more countries become better and get accepted we could avoid conflict in the Balkans
[ha ha]
Yo thanks for this, I was going to make the same remarks from the other side
I cannot in good conscience say anything else, in part because I'm also *very* aware of my Turkish heritage and also due to the massive mutual cultural influences
I was scared for Turks during the huge earthquake of 1999, I was scared for Turks during the attempted coup, and I'm scared for Turks now
Anyone who says I shouldn't be can kiss my tan, Mediterranean ass
A billion different kinds of budget-off-brand coca cola
I'm not even joking, I can remember at least a dozen off the top of my head
we have [λούξ (loux)] which is the Greek fanta
and [Green Cola] which is a cola type drink but with Stevia instead of sugar, i think it's become international and is being sold in a few other european countries now
We've had a total of 3 dictatorships if you don't count the Nazi, Italian and Bulgarian occupation in WW2
The first is the Pangalos dictatorship, it was short lived and moronic
Almost nobody remembers it or even knows it existed
Then from 1936 to 1941 we had the Metaxas dictatorship, which is viewed the most favourably out of the 3, simply cause although fascistic the only ones who really were affected negatively were slavs and communists, and since Metaxas was an expert in defensive warfare he was a huge part of the reason we were winning against the Italians in 1940-41
He died 2 months before the German invasion
And finally we have the 1966 to 1974 military Junta of the 3 officers
This is the one everyone in Greece remembers it as **the** dictatorship
Whilst the previous two were only hard for communists and left leaning people, this one was almost universally bad
All kinds of freedoms were suppressed, and in the end no side you could say was satisfied with their rule, leftists least of all
Moderate Right wingers hate them cause they played a huge part to the fact Cyprus is this fucked up today and left wingers for obvious reasons
The only good that came out of this dictatorship was economic growth and the modernization of the military not much else
As you can imagine none of these were particularly fun for communists and left wing politicians
Especially the Junta
But are any of them particularly taboo
The first two really aren't because one is forgotten and the other is tied with military glory
The last one though you could say is taboo, it has embedded a fear in the Greek mind that any short of extensive government intervention via police action is "the new Junta" which as you can imagine has led to a myriad of problems
There are also some right wing Junta sympathisers that like it cause they only see the "economy good and communists pawned" part, phrases like "but the Junta built roads" and "you were sleeping with the house unlocked" have become kind of a joke to mock sympathisers because they use them this often
In short, it is kind of taboo but at the same time no one shuts up about it
*(TL;DR Yes, the 3rd one, kinda)*
We had our fair share of dictators in the past
Firstly Ioannis metaxas is by many regarded as a hero because he denied Grazzi his ultimatum thus beginning the Greco-italian war
He was still, a dictator though
Then there's Papadopoulos who took power in 1967
(coup d'etat)
During the first years of his dictatorship, people couldn't go out after 9:00 PM, because soldiers had orders to shoot in sight
Many people praise him, and say stuff like "Yeah but because of that military Junta we have these" beautiful" streets now" Imo People who say shit like that aren't necessarily right-wingers
They're just uneducated
Not at all
Civil war, Economic Crisis & the 2015-2019 government are considered Taboo here instead
Talking about it isn't taboo but if you ever say it was better back in the Junta you might just get hut over the head for being a fascist
For this to make sense, I'll have to explain some stuff (the history may be boring but please read it)
So, we had had a military junta for seven years 1967-1974
The thing about it almost everyone forgets is that it didn't fell because of a mass uprising but because it was inherently unstable
The "president" then called Karamanlis, a politician who was prime minister before the junta, to return to the country and govern as a part of the junta
However, he pulled a trick on them and dissolved the military regime and called for elections, real elections not the staged ones the junta used as a legitimacy thing
Karamanlis won the elections (of course) and proceeded to transition the country to a real democracy, he managed to do that, it was a success story
A trial for the junta members was held in 1975, it was like the Greek version of the Nuremberg trial
The junta was over, many of the junta instigators went to prison for life and three of them were sentenced to death for their actions, but Karamanlis reverted them to life imprisonment as a show of good faith
AND THAT WAS THE FIRST MISTAKE, because those people didn't die in prison, they eventually got freed
A later government in 1990 (of the party Karamanlis had started) freed Pattakos (one of them the Juntists), who lived until 2016, spreading misinformation about the regime of 1967-1974
THIS inspired many Juntists to form their own party, Golden Dawn (yeah, ,, that Golden Dawn)
It is kinda taboo to reminisce about the junta, but because we did not take the correct steps to isolate these extremists from the public, the problem did not get solved (remember,,, Golden Dawn)
Furthermore, not everyone knows the details that I just described, they're not "taught" in school
Of course, we have the 17th of November remembrance anniversary, in which we celebrate a Polytechnic students' uprising, but it's not enough
You're just told of some bad things the junta did and that's it
Nothing about how the country was unstable before the coup d'état, the details, the junta's economic policy or even the facts I just mentioned
I'm sorry if I bored you, I just needed to vent my frustrations about the matter
They say all right wing sided politicians are no wirse then a junta that ran into a colledge campus and ended in a 1973, so like its bad but not as bad as the junta
The economic growth is a myth (growth had started back in 1963, so it had no relation with the Junta's economic policy)
They increased the national debt 10 times, from 15 billion Drachma to 114 billion Drachma
No one wanted to associate with the regime so no investments came, except some from the USA, and that's why NATO and the 'bloody' Americans are still kinda, sorta hated by some left-wingers
The modernisation of the military is true and that's why the debt increased, because the regime was encouraged to buy shit from the USA to contain the "COMMUNIST THREAT".
Also,..
>In short, it is kind of taboo but at the same time no one shuts up about it
So true
2015-2019 is not taboo just controversial
The civil we tho yeah, I believe it’s still the event that divides the country  and responsible for the political opinion of most people, left or right wing
I think the rule is Greeks can argue with each other about the Crisis, but when another  European tries to join the conversation, people shift uncomfortably in their seats and just stop talking or start attacking the poor EU citizen for intervening
As for the Syriza government, well, doesn't it depend if you're an Syriza left-winger or a anything else (New Democracy, KINAL, KKE or something different)
However, I must agree with you about the Civil War being a taboo topic
Like, how do people even think that the Civil War wounds are healed
Dunno tho, what do you think
(\*) Of course joking about the Junta is most of the times fine, romanticising it is taboo
A running joke is "Η Χούντα έφτιαξε δρόμους" (The Junta built roads), which is a joke, because (the Juntists use it to distract people from all the horrible things the military regime did and) it's used to ridicule them
Another one is "Ρε, αυτά δε θα γίνονταν με Χούντα!" (Hey, that would happen with the Junta
I learned English from music and video games
Nowadays there are very few games that can be in Greek mostly PS4 exclusives
Like God of War and lately Days Gone
So playing in English is the most common but when Greek language is available I will use it
Pretty much every video game translated in greek was horrendous
I was playing the God4 and i had to swich to English cause the sound actrors were horrible in Greek
In English because there aren't many games translated into Greek but I recently played God of War
The translation, adaptation and voice acting was spot on
I check if my language is available but I always put it on english, not just in games, but also in movies, on my devices etc
I'm just used to setting everything to english, also I think acoustically greek is only for comedies
Always English, it's really weird for games to be in Greek
There are people who prefer it though
What do you mean by that last part
Yeah sorry, I meant to write "is only good for comedies" but I forgot good
It's just that I personally can't hear greek on any other setting (action, horror etc
) and take the film/videogame seriously
That's the case in Greece as well
Apart from Greek, I speak English, French and Italian
Speaking as many languages as possible is a huge skill nowadays
I felt so nice being able to understand some Spanish when I was in Spain thanks to my Italian and I feel so sorry I quit studying German when I was younger because it seemed very difficult
I fall in love with every single language I come across, and that's too painful, especially if it's from a language group I'm not familiar with
I currently speak Greek, English, some Danish and a tiny bit of German and Spanish, lots of people would be impressed that I can hold a conversation in at least three languages, but it's nowhere near enough for me
I suppose he meant that Americans don't have the habit of learning a foreign language because you can get by with plain good ol' English
So, if there's no need, why learn one
These sound beautiful
Unfortunately I don't think Greece is the market for these items unless you count refrigerators
What exactly are they
Snow itself is hardly a common thing in my country
It looks beautiful, I'm definitely making this
Thanks
Or just come to the northwest buddy
Seems to be more of a cultural thing than a climate thing
It also gets quite cold where I'm from (usually -15°C although this year it hasn't even dropped below -5) but I haven't seen something like that either
Delightful
I love the snow so much, but I've moved away from my hometown and it doesn't snow that much where I live now
This winter has been so shitty, it's the first time it hasn't snowed in my hometown since before I was born
I don't remember any catastrophic explosion in Greece
Don't know if it happened when I was younger
My thoughts in the Beirut blast
I watched ,and I don't know why, all the videos I found on twitter and as I mentioned there I think it will be really hard for me to watch action movies and seeing people acting scared, when you ve seen real footage of people's lives being destroyed . Getting older makes you realize other aspects of something this magnitude happening .
Since no one has done my country, here it is
Turkey: We don't really have a problem with the people but we hate your government
Also history doesn't really help with the situation
Bulgaria: We don't really know much about you
You seem very similar to russians from our point of view
Albania: Mixed feelings
I love Albanians but there is generally some racism towards you in Greece
Hope you can fix up your country
Italy: We actually really like you guys
Also beautiful country
Spain: To us you are like Italy but a little weirder
NM: We're mad because of you name
No one really knows much about you, sorry
Cyprus: We all just kinda assume that your are in Greece
Germany: Sunburned tourists that wear socks with sandals
UK: Despite the Parthenon marbles, which are really important to us, we like you
Scandinavian countries: You seem too advanced and educated
Thank you my Hungarian friend
Love back ️
I am proud of some parts of our history, but others ooo boiii
(ahemm
dictatorship, aheemmm
The campaign to expand to Turkey about 100 yrs ago, aheemmm
Very very very great and honest politicians, modern state
But thank you very very much
Oh man you made me shudder while reading the comment about Greece
Vielen Dank
ich hoffe unsere Beziehung wird nicht so kompliziert bleiben
I love you
i CAN EASILY DRINK NOTHING ELSE
- Στου διαόλου το κέρατο (on the devil's horn)
- Στου διαόλου τη μάνα (at the devil's mom)
- Στη μέση του πουθενά (in the middle of nowhere)
- Στον γάμο του Καραγκιόζη (at Karagkiozis' (main character of an old greek shadow play) wedding)
- Στο μουνί χωριό (in the pussy village)
- Στο υπερπέραν (in the place that's very far away, usually also means a parallel universe)
- Στην άλλη άκρη του κόσμου/της Γης (on the other side of the world/the Earth)
We say "in Kolopetinitsa", a small village near Delphi, for something isolated and forgotten
For something really far far away, we say "by the Devil's mother".
We say "στου διαόλου την μάνα" (stu diaolu tin mana) which means "at the devil's mother"
I can't remember the other saying we have, but we have one saying: "In Zimbabwe" meaning a faraway land
In Greek, we say "stou diaolou ti mana" which means "at the Devil's mother".
+ "Στην κολοπετινιτσα" haha
I'll admit I haven't heard that one haha
Us too
And the people from areas that rear them are very proud of their recipes
We eat snails too, dunno bout frogs tho
Is this satire
Lol, if not literally only in Ioannina
Ok this image is actually kinda gross tho :P
In Greece we always just slurp them/pick them out their shell
So a plate would look something like [this]
In Greek language it's "έτοιμος η όχι, έρχομαι"
"Μπου και βγαίνω"
Basically "Boo and I am out"
I don't mind at all
I seriously find it cute when my female Ophthalmologist's Cypriot accent comes out by accident, in general I find different Greek accents fascinating
Italy : why is it considered an insult to the Italian culture to eat pizza and pasta at the same time
Turkey : How can a Muslim nation produce so many alcoholics
I visited Rome two years ago
In every cafe I went, I asked if I can be served a cappuccino freddo (cold cappuccino)
The answer was always NO
In fact, I couldn't find any type of cold coffee on the menus
My fellow Italians, how can you live without the pleasure of cold coffees
I don't understand why Turks will drive 5 hours to go to the beach and party in Alexandroupoli
It has probably the worst beaches in Greece and is an ugly city
Surely there are better nightlife and beaches closer to Istanbul
That's a thing here too
I never understood how my parents will feel tired if they miss their 2 hour nap
Good to know, thanks
Are these choices available everywhere
Although I did ask if I can have any other type of cold coffee (it was the middle of the summer and the temperature was rather high), I wasn't offered the choice of them as an alternative
Instead, they looked at me as I have offended them in some way just by asking
Anyway, what I find rather peculiar is the mere fact that cold coffees aren't popular in Italy
I really don't get how can that be
We live on cold coffee here in Greece, and not just during the summer months
Being both Mediterranean, I expected that this would also be the case in the country that has graced our lives with espresso and cappuccino
That's my point
How come they are not popular
Having a cold coffee, especially during summer months, is a bliss
Name
I'm often in Puglia and would love to order this
Try making it at home, if you're not given the choice elsewhere
Lol
Glad to be of service at least for the TIL part
As for the codfish, we mostly eat it fried along with skordalia (no, there is no cheese in skordalia)
I know enough as not to mess with a Portuguese on how to enjoy bacalhau ;)
There are more Greeks than you imagine who consider that big glass with frappe (the coffee you are referring to)  as the worst kind of coffee (personally, I like it)
I'm not an expert on the matter, but I know that there are various kinds of cold coffee - most are hot brewed and then served with ice, whereas there is also cold brewed coffee
As for its taste, It's obviously a case of 'one man's meat is another man's poison' ;)
I guess you've never been to Greece :)
Oh no, does that mean that I wouldn't have the pleasure of a cold coffee in Portugal as well
You have to try it before you judge it ;)
Cheese on seafood is a general no-no
Fish + cheese just doesn't go together
The main reason, among others, is that seafood/fish are light and delicate flavors and cheese just takes over, rendering the fish useless in the fish
For the hot sauce thing you have to dig into the Italian cuisine in order to understand why it's "weird". Italian cuisine is based on the simplicity of the dishes that highlight the products themselves
It's usually lighter on the palate, and if you put a hot sauce over that, you basically ruin that effect
Think of it as the opposite of American/BBQ food
Italian cuisine=you cover the light flavors,  fatty cuisine=you enhance the flavors and cut through the fat
I was not familiar with the fish pie, so I just read its recipe
Our Portuguese friend is not going to like it
Because you'll eat your coffee ice cream in a few minutes, whereas you will prolong your pleasure by slowly sipping your coffee for many more minutes ;)
TIL and skordalia
It seems I'm working for your benefit today :P
If you do try it, let me know if you liked it
Cold (or iced) coffees are extremely popular here throughout the year and there is no cafe where you wouldn't find them (except for, maybe, a traditional kafeneion in some village)
We mostly drink cappuccino or espresso freddo, and frappe (instant coffee shaken with cold water and sugar, then served on ice, with or without milk)
I initially thought that these coffees were pretty common everywhere, but then my travels abroad made me realise that it's mostly a Greek thing
Or that, at least, they are not so common in Europe, because I do have enjoyed a cold coffee in Montreal, Canada, and I was just reading that they are pretty popular in the US too
So, it doesn't surprise me that a Belgian hasn't heard of them
Still, it is surprising to me that cold coffees are not a part of the Mediterranean coffee culture in general
If you ever find yourself in Athens, send me a message and I'll tell you where to go for a really nice glass of cold coffee
Exactly
I think all cuisines are acceptable and can be delicious, but one has to judge them based on their context
For example, both my parents (Greek & Italian), especially my dad can be annoying with different cuisines, just because they judge them based on *their* standards, which are pretty much strictly Greek & Italian
So they can't understand why Indian food is good - my dad claims that just too much spice involved and he can't taste anything, nothing stands out
He can't understand that the point of a curry is the flavor of all those mixed spices
What do you think
I am not pretentious at all at what I said, and I am not your co-worker man
You just have to understand that different cuisines have different approaches
I tried to explain how Italian cuisine works, and I don't take back what I said because I know I am accurate on that, Italian cuisine is **all about** delicasy, so the hot sauce thing is 100% accurate
Even the spicy Italian dishes are extremely balanced
Not to mention that hot sauces are (besides very spicy), very flavorfull, so they cover everything else
Now, is your sushi coworker pretentious about the sushi thing
100%. I personally don't do that on sushi for the same reasons I described, so again I can't see how I'm pretentious
Lol man, McDonalds
No thanks
Exactly, you are right, good point
It is sad, but at the same time I understand it it's older generations
They just don't have the experience we do, you know
It's okay, don't worry :)
Haha, you got me with the Mydia
Personally not a big fan for the reasons I listed but if the Feta is not too much and the dish is done well, I like it
I also like pineapple on pizza, as long as is not too much - again it can become over-powering
So I assume in the mydia saganaki you make them at home in order to add the hot sauce right
because we don't really have hot sauces in greek restaurants, unless the dish itself has chilli flakes
I went to Turkey a couple of months ago
I was appauled by most fish dishes
They had a great product of fresh fish and they ruined it with butter, spices and peppers
The only thing I couldn't taste was fish, it's just a pitty
Um, Google
It's even a verb γκουγκλάρω /guglaro/.
We also use Merenda (Nutella knock off) for cocoa derivatives we spread on bread
We say UHU for glue stick
That's all I can think of right now
chocolate spread - Merenda
cream cheese - Philadelphia
?sponge cloth
(used for cleaning) - Wettex
big cars like those Jeep makes
idk how you call them - Jeep
diapers - Pampers
chocolate milk - Milko
compressed milk - NOYNOY milk
any search engine - Google
In Greek the car brand's name "Jeep"  is used to refer for an SUV vehicle no matter if it's an BMW, VW etc
The first one that comes to mind is [Merenda] it's basically like nutella but Greek and Nutella and all it's clones fall under the category of Merenda
The other is Black & Decker the word has deteriorated to blackedecker and it means [those] handheld drills though i've noticed that that is slowly dissapearing
Edit: u/stefanos916 reminded me that
Jeep is used to refer to anything that looks like it can do offroad and is on 4 wheels
Coca-cola too
Jeep ( τζίπ ) for SUV’s
Also:
Wettex for those thin sponges that are used for spilled liquids
Ajax for window cleaning spray
Fairy/Ava for dish detergent
Teza for any type of bug spray
Also:
* Black & Decker for power tools, more specifically electric drills
* Sikaflex for polyurethane based sealants
* Post-it for sticky notes
* Sellotape for sticky tape
* Tupper (from Tupperware) for plastic containers used for storing food
* Thermos for vacuum flasks (even those that are "regular flasks" but resemble vacuum flasks are called Thermos)
>We also use Merenda (Nutella knock off)
Watch your f$%@!+ mouth
Do Portuguese use the Jeep to refer to SUV vehicles no matter the manufacturer
If you eat it, it's going to be a 24h a day snack
Oh shit yeah let me add those too
Then we have that in common
Not dragon in Greece, but we call a kite an eagle "αετός"
No, the Greek word for kite is "χαρταετός" literally "paper-eagle".
āetós is what I found . The truth is as we don't use Latin alphabet we don't think about the Latin pronunciation unless we have some interest in linguistics or people study them
There is no standard way to transcribe Greek into Latin alphabet, as there are often more than one or none equivalent letters for the same phoneme
I suspect it is the same issue for any two alphabets
If you are interested in a word's pronunciation, you can look it up with its original spelling in forvo
com .
How can I unread a comment
Thinking the same
I´ve said lots of similar dad jokes while on vacation and I can only hope locals didn´t take them at face value
Another user already said it, we call the rest of the country επαρχία (eparchia)
It is an official term, so it is not derogatory but people from Athens will sometimes refer to non-athenians as "eparchiotes" in a derogatory tone, as in uncivilised or stupid
Some Athenians do use the term η επαρχία (i eparhía, the "countryside"), but it's mainly for rural areas, not cities
Yeah I thought Greek was rare, then had embarrassing conversation in public (in Greek obv) and found out about the 400,000
Greeks in Montreal
When I was in high school we went to Venice for a school trip
I remember waiting in line to buy gelato with my friends and commenting how good looking the guy in front of us was
(he was about our age)
Having the false security of being in another country where no one spoke Greek I went on and on about how handsome he was (nothing inappropriate mind you)
After getting his gelato the guy turned around, looked me in the eyes with a huge grin greeted me in Greek and left
It turned out a school near ours was also having a school trip to Venice at the same time
Lol
Ναι και όχι
Μια φορά στο Λονδίνο όταν ήμουν πιο μικρός μιλούσα με την μάνα μου στα Ελληνικά και ένας δίπλα μας άρχισε να μας μιλάει και αυτός στα Ελληνικά και είχε πλάκα, είχε έρθει και αυτός για κάτι δουλειές φαίνεται λμαο
Αλλά όχι δεν ήταν embarrassing
I was in Nuremberg once with my school, we had gone to a cafe
Few tables further down two semi-old (I mean I was at school, anything above 25 was "old") ladies were staring at us
While looking at them I told my friend in Greek, "why are those hags staring at us
" On the way out one lady asked about us, what we were doing, which school, city etc
The other lady also mentioned (in German not Greek) that there are others who speak and understand our language
I think she may have been referring to the word "hag" I used to refer to them
It's fair, but like why keep staring throughout our stay at the cafe (?), it didn't seem we were bothering anyone
My story is not that interesting, literally all I said was that once in London I was speaking in Greek and a stranger next to me said hello in Greek
I thought I would just reply directly to OP since I felt like I could relate to them as we are both Greek and both have a "story" taking place in London
I'm not withholding secret information from the general public, I just basically said "same happened to me" in our language
I don't think that any added value would be given to others on here with my comment basically just saying "lol same"
So your reply: Unnecessary
Those that stand out are that people in Berlin used to be dressed with dull colours avoiding to wear 'loud' brands, big logos and striking prints/patterns in their daily life
Also in the UK, a lot of younds wear casually pieces that are here regarded formal, like brogues, shirts, Oxford boot etc
Another thing is that nobody wears desert boots here butthey seem common throughout North Europe
I only found Spaniards to dress very similar to Greeks and some East Europe countries like Czechia or Serbia
I've been to Italy twice and I had pretty much the same experience that you had
The Italians are too perfectly dressed
Hahaha, fair point
I was referring to winter styles
Since a lot of people have mentioned driving to nearby countries (for those living in border regions), we also have to aknowledge cheap flights
We have a lot of low cost carriers (at least pre-corona) and as others have mentioned we just need an ID for travelling inside the EU (+ some other countries) so a lot of people travel for work or leisure frequently
Just before the pandemic, I travelled to Manchester from Thessaloniki, Greece (almost 4 hr flight) for just €40 roundtrip
Some months before that I had booked a roundtrip ticket to Berlin for just €20
I would usually travel abroad 1-3 times a year, but not to my neighboring countries, I prefer the northern European ones
I've only driven to another country once, and it took about 7 hours
That's true and sadly this will change for good
OP, once you get from Greece to Italy you just drive through every country
I vaguely remember showing an ID in Swiss borders but then I think they stopped doing that after a few months
My dream is to do the roadtrip again and include as many countries as possible
The first time we drove/used ferries from Greece to Ireland
It took us 5 days because our dog's passport had the **order** of the vaccines the other way around and we couldn't take her on the ferry in Calais
Anyway, if that hadn't happen we would have done it for sure in 2,5 days, with stops for sleep
France has great rest stops along the way
I would say the Turkish word "Tefter" =book for writing notes etc
We added an "i" making it Tefteri/ Τεφτέρι. Though it's used only by boomers
It must be Albanian - I never thought about it
Perhaps French/German would be officially more popular, but that's school level, not actually spoken
For sure Albanian
There are plenty of Albanians here due to the easy access in the 90s. Maybe Russian or Romanian is the third one
Either Albanian (through immigration) or Turkish in Thrace or Slavic dialects in Macedonia and Thrace (Regions in Greece)
the youngest generation is very good at it even though no one learns shit at school
at school they have some old Dell computers with windows XP and everyone just plays Friv on them even though they can barely run it
but for some reason the average teen know how to pirate games and use microsoft office
in Greece we have 2 kinds of high schools the "Professional high school" aka EPAL (Epagkelmatiko Lykio) and the general high school aka GEL (Geniko Lykio) where on epal you choose a job you want and barely do any other subjects (for example if you want to be a mechanic there are engines there you can work on and actual good PCs) where you learn about programming and softwarer engineering
Almost everyone I've met age 18-45 has at the very least smoked weed a couple of times
Recreational use every once in a while is very common with people in my age group (mid-20s)
Even older people have a neutral or even positive view on cannabis use
The main group that's against cannabis use is deeply religious and conservative people
It's considered illegal though and being caught with >1g on you means you'll most likely get arrested, but even cops are not that harsh on users, they mainly care about getting info on people that sell weed
a tad bit too popular
i know quite a few people who have smoked
i've seen it being done in front of me more than once
Yeah, it's a common joke in Greece that if the cops catch you with x amount of weed, they will report that they caught you with x minus a gram because they'll keep it for themselves
Since Syriza left and Nea Dimokratia has become the ruling party, police has become a little bit stricter in general, especially on younger people
Actually they are not stricter, they just get a pass for being assholes
I'm not sure if they are more relaxed about weed though
I'm not sure
My (not that educated) guess is that actions like this persuade people with more conservative views, that the police has been doing work to establish order
Thankfully not really, except for one: Χρήστος, and the female version Χριστίνα.
Now, Χριστός is the Greek name for Christ and it is spelled with an iota instead of an eta like Χρήστος. However some people spell Χρήστος as Χρίστος and honestly I have no idea why
Also for some reason Χριστίνα is normally spelled with an iota, but some will spell it with an eta
We don't generally misspell names because we name mostly after specific people and also names have specific name days (most pertaining to Christian saints who died on that day) when they are celebrated
So you don't name your kid Ελαίνη (Eleni) because it makes no sense, you name her Ελένη.
My friend who teaches at an Italian primary school has a student called Daiana
Not yet because I'm still saving money
If there wasn't a pandemic it would be way easier for me, it will probably take me around 2 years
Planning on moving to Spain or maybe a Latin American country
Colder than Iceland
We have an entire direction (east) dedicated to that
Greece is isn't very densely populated, so there are quite a few places like that, mainly around the more mountainous regions, where land can't really be used for farming
Additionally, there's loads of small uninhabited islands that offer pure isolation
Yeah, but you can't really live as a hermit in the mainland
Most mountains have small villages built on them
In all my life I've never encountered a mountain road that didn't lead to a village
Plus, mountains not being very good land for farming doesn't stop some people from farming them
As for the islands, I suppose that if you found an island that was fertile enough and you had a way to solve the water problem then living there in isolation wouldn't be too far fetched
Agrafa mountains would probably be the closest to empty I think
Considering that a large number of the XIXth century prime ministers were born outside our (then) borders, then no, none at all
Keep in mind though that the constitution prohibits the office of the President of the Republic to a natural born citizen
I think it wouldn't be such a big deal
The first King of Greece was Austrian
I'm a bit confused
By Greek do you mean place of birth or ethnic self identification
Because for the first I can see that there are exceptions to what you describe ([ex
1] [ex
Ah, I see
Well that makes sense given the, unfortunately, rocky relations between our two countries
Italy
We share lots of history, mythology, and even modern day cultural aspects (especially western regions of Greece), plus the phonology of (modern) Greek is entirely based on Latin, and it all started with them defeating us ~2150 years ago
No hard feelings about WWII, we love you <3
Time and reconciliation heals everything; your still our best bud
Yes, but they are typically well spelled
Absolutely
NYPD and Harvard are among the most common
I have two hoodies like that, but I've never actually read what is written on them
Yeah, we have these a lot
Taking all words literally and not the real meaning
cold and boomer jokes are popular
also some the west might consider racist
True we got lots of racist stuff
our country
The Thessaloniki metro
The plans and the construction started so long ago and they still aren't done
Its a running gig that if something unlikely to happen, people will say "I will happen when the metro of Thessaloniki finishes". Current projections say that will be around 2024
Also the bus system in Thessaloniki (my fellow Greeks you know the pain of ΟΑΣΘ)
It unites us as a nation to complain about it and it is really awful
Good news though with the Corona virus not many people use it and it is a 2/10 rather a -100/10( source: I live in Thessaloniki)
We have the same with the Thessaloniki Metro
Its construction started in the 80s and latest estimates say it will be opened in 2023
Most definitely
Isn't that a French thing
"Right now"? That implies there was a time when they weren't XD
Yup, I tend to follow the politicis of as many countries as I can
Especially the ones in which there is often drama like Italy, Spain and Poland
Some others are less interesting to the observer, like Germany and Portugal
That is actually good of them, cause it means stability
I'm mostly interested in greek politics, although I'm also following - _not that closely but still_ - US politics
I'm generally fairly interested about different issues in different parts of the globe, but I have more interest about my country's.
Ireland has a very weird political spectrum :
1) The nationalists are not the far-right (there is no far-right) but the far-left
2) The party registered as Liberal (Renew group) is actually more socially conservative than the party that is registered in the EPP group
Although I see Fianna Fail and Finn Gael as pretty similar in most issues to be honest
3) They have a weird transferable vote system
I live in Ireland too, and I think that despite it being a generally very well run country, and their politics do not incude the lunatics that ours do, they are intentionally ignoring the extremely high rents of Dublin
Ioannina city
Especially in the the winter, It's situated next to a large lake, making it very foggy
It's full of antique buildings, crooked trees and a huge menacing castle wall that surrounds a part of the city
It also has a large psychiatric clinic so there are many crazy people about
It's basically Greek Gotham
Very common
I remember a party when I was 13 and the girl's parents were there too
We were allowed to drink still
My dad gave me ouzo when I was 8 while we were eating in a tavern, he was laughing his ass off when he saw my face burning lol
In general booze is there, usually beer with Sunday meals, but the attitude in drinking is different than in other places
Nobody likes people getting wasted on alcohol
So from an early age you learn there is a limit
Also, you learn to have eaten before you drink and basically use booze occasionally within context
In bars if they see you clearly underaged, they might not let you in but usually they do especially if you're with a group of older people than you
By law it's 18 but nobody really goes by that
You start heavily drinking from 18 to mid 20s usually when you're away in Uni or college
But soon after that it is normal to stop and go back to occasional drinking
A few people that are already bad drivers tend to drink and drive and they're killers on wheels but there isn't much you can do with those retards other than the police have regular checks points where they can bust them
Usually by 12 or 13 people drink, they don't really get drunk until like 14 or 15
This has been asked more than a million times here
Do people like hearing underage drinking stories
Technically the legal age is 17 but everyone says fuck that and starts drinking at 14
I can confirm this comment is accurate
I can confirm too
Also it's not uncommon to see 14 year olds drink [mavrodaphne] or Nàma, they also give it in mass at the church with antidoron, or something like that
Try vergina weiss if you're into wheat beer, it's one of the better weissbiers i've had, even compared to some pretty high profile brands
Also their lager is very good, especially for its low price
I can confirm with my experience
My sister used to drink Gordon Space a lot when she was kid
I remember i tasted a bit of alcohol in the past and i didn't liked it
Also I even had a situation on school with one classmate which his mother put Tsipouro on his school bag instead of water
I'm gonna chip in for Greece, let's see:
Arranged from most seats to least:
Nea Dimokratia (New Democracy): The current leading party
Typical conservatives, pro free economy, pro European
One of the oldest right wing parties in Greece
Syriza: The former government and opposition leader right now
Although they are often characterized as left wing, I  would describe party' policies mostly as center left
Movement for change: Used to be known as PASOK
Center left once more but less progressive or left wing than Syriza
KKE (communist party): The oldest party in Greece
Typical communist party, used to be pro Soviet Union, now embracing euroscepticism
Greek Solution: Far right party
Embraces nationalism, Grexit, pro Russian, anti abortion, anti LGBT
Their leader sells scam medicine on TV (I don't know why he isn't in jail)
MeRA25: Varoufakis' project
Pro European, left wing progressives that seek the economic reform of European Union
I'm Greek and I had to google some of the parties
Diem is Varoufakis and Movement of Change is (mostly) Pasok
Nothing wrong with the way you wrote it
It's just that new parties keep popping up (and Pasok changes its name-allies almost every election)
It's a British thing, not getting too involved basically haha
Another good example is "How are you
", "Not too bad". So are you good or are you bad
Νομιζω πιο καλα απο το honorable θα ταιριαζε το decent
You don't have to drop the ν, it's not Cypriot only
Hahaha good one
Yeah I know exactly what you mean
As an ex-immigrant to the UK who is curious about social structures, it makes complete sense why you guys use these phrases
After all, phrases are quite reflective of how a society works
Greece is the opposite end of that for example, where the phrases we use reflect our inability to "filter" speech, "saying it as it is" so to speak
So they are very direct
I think so
I described it to another user that mentioned the same, but they are American
It's the same comment thread if you wanna have a look
Not my experience, it's a fossilized expression
Hahah shit
I feel you, I am very pale and get sunburnt straight away
However, after living in the UK and returning to Greece I have concluded that I'd rather have 3 months of extreme heat (which in air conditioned spaces & during the night is fine) than constant weather that's a pain in the ass
I am not a depressive person, but after a few years there were days that I found myself not able to get out of bed because of the constant grim weather
Also, in the UK you can never count on the weather because it can turn around so easily
Perhaps find a country like Portugal or so, it's somewhere in between if you go to the north
Yes, I never disputed that the retention of the final ν wasn't a Cypriot characteristic, it's just that personally as a Greek person interacting with other Greeks my age (under or around 20) have never had such a reaction or even considered it strange
I thought it was akin to phrases such as πρώτον, δεύτερον, etc
that sound weird to me without a ν. Cheers
I guess it's an appropriate time to say "fair enough"!
Just your name and surname
Some people have two names and they choose one and the other is treated like a middle name
I have 2 last names
Multiple first names are actually quite common, though not prevalent
It is also very common to give the child the name of a grandparent
I have personally met many people who have multiple first names specifically to please multiple grandparents
I also know several cases of a main first name that is Christian (George, Eleutherios), and a second being from Ancient Greek mythology or history (Achilles)
I guess the parents couldn't decide between a normal and a cool name
it is a really really uncommon thing but the circumstances were responsible for this
in England you get your mom's name here in Greece you get your dad's name and I was born in England and since my parents wanted to come back so I had to get both names
so, you shouldn't be sorry :)
Since I'm Greek, I guess getting ready for the revolution
Propably die in the Greek revolts tbh
Preparing to fight in the Great Revolution of 1821
> Farmer
> Goes to church for 3 to 4 hours a day
> Reads rebellious poems to his 6 children (and spanks them afterwards)
Tasks for tomorrow:
> Picking up tomatoes and cucumbers
> Pissing & shitting on my Ottoman neighbour's property
Get in patrioti, we are taking Motherland back
Grab your rifle,we gotta take our freedomback
Give us another 2 years and we'll join you
Giouuuurgiaaaa
πρεπει αν ρωτησω πως βαζεις παραπανω απο μια σημαιες?
The adjective normally is written like this "patriotis- πατριώτης".
But when we want to call out to someone we use the clitic case and patriotis becomes patrioti
For example ",Hey patrioti have you have been
So saying "Hey patriotis, doesn't make sense"
Concluding you could say that it's the same excluding some differences
Well, Italian and Greek share many words since Latin also used Ancient Greek words
there is always an exchange in languages
:) also found this:
patriot
late 16th century: from French *patriote*, from late Latin *patriota* ‘fellow countryman’, from Greek *patriōtēs*, from *patrios* ‘of one's fathers’, from *patris* ‘fatherland’.
Correct
Yes, There will be an economic backlash from China but if we have a unanimous stance on the issue that backlash will be an duble edge short for them
Anyway we shouldn't relay havily on undemocratic regims such as China Rusia Turkey etc ...
I would prefer more political and economic cooperation between EU member states rather than with dispute territories
Here we think Santa Claus lives in Lapland
But our own Santa Claus version (actually the two saints have been kind of merged together) is Saint Basil from Caesarea, Cappadocia (today in Turkey)
I'm not aware how it works for other orthodox Christian churches, but for the Greek orthodox church, our equivalent is Saint Basil/Άγιος Βασίλης, that lives on Caesarea of Cappadocia, in Asia Minor (modern day Turkey)
He visits on new year's day, instead of Christmas
Saint Nikolaos is the patron saint of the mariners instead, and consequently the patron saint of Hellenic Navy as well
I am guessing it is the same in Cyprus
Many people believe that [mount Olympus] is not an actual mountain but just a mythological place
A Czech guy who thought that we still believe in Zeus and the Olympians as our gods
Plus many are surprised to find out that we do have winter with minus temperatures and snow
It's at the borders of the districts of Thessaly and Macedonia in North - central Greece
There's always a bit of truth and history in every Greek myth
Most of the times the locations and the action that took place are correct, it's when the monsters, God's and  heroes appear when the myth part kicks in ;)
I don't know which is our most embarrassing tech moment
All I know is that we would never pay for Windows XP
We just use a cracked version of the software we need
Which word from your native language you wish could translate perfectly in English but doesn't?
Not a word, but μεν/δε. It's kinda annoying to type the full "on one hand/on the other hand" because there isn't something better
Μαλάκας (Malákas) simply because I use it the most
The Greek word φιλότιμο (philótimo)
It means something like earnestness, but not exactly that
For the word εύνοια (evnia) there isn't exactly one on one translation
ἑταῖρος (etéros) is another one, meaning: companion/comrade/friend/partner/pupil/disciple/associate/ _in plural:_ the cavalry of the Macedonian Kings
Note: these are ancient Greek and modern Greek meanings of the word
The word ιδού (eethoo) cannot be directly translated
It's like the French voíla
Actually, it could maybe be translated as lo or behold, but I'm not sure these words cover its whole meaning
Άρα (ara) can be roughly translated to: consequently/therefore/so/accordingly, but doesn't have a real equivalent
Άραγε (ˈaɾaʝe) is used when you're wondering about sth
Γιατί *άραγε* δεν έχει έρθει ακόμη;
=*I wonder* why hasn't he come yet
Many Greek words have been borrowed in English, so it's more difficult to find words that don't have a 1:1 translation
Edit: added words
We need that so bad
I'm still an amateur as a German speaker but couldn't doch translate as "indeed"?
We kinda have an equivalent word in Greek
We say εικοσιτετράωρο which literally means "24houred" more or less
So you can say 1 εικοσιτετράωρο =1 24houred, 2 24houred etc
the former and the latter
That's one of the things I like the most about Danish
In Greek you can say "my relationship" if you don't wanna specify the gender but that's gonna basically out you as homosexual even if you're not
It's kinda lame
I love the word kæreste
That's good too but can't be used for every instance
If I want to say "Mr Johnson did X men, but Mr Smith did Y de", former and latter won't be of any use
Yup, I can't translate it word by word but we use it to suggest that sth is "just right"/"as is should be", mostly meaning that it is ideal for the circumstance at hand
For example, if sb watches a movie which feels "just right" for that specific time/setting/mood, he may say that "the movie is oti prepei", even if he thinks that the movie is generally kinda bad or stupid
Well in that case wouldn't it be a πλεονασμός in Greek as well
As long as you're saying "but" you don't also have to use "men/de" do you
Idk I could be wrong though
Yeah the "but" is perhaps superfluous yet point stands, I usually have to type long sentences/alter the sentence
Men/de is so neat and tidy
True I like it, makes words flow much easier
Literally all the residential buildings
After ww2, greeks starter building cheap, short (5-7 floors) and minimalistic (not the modern art way, but just plain concrete) houses, who were obviously built with practical reasons in mind and had appearance completely forgotten
So, the entirety of athens looks like a pile of ugliness because of those buildings
First question: yes, since 3rd year up until the 12th
Worth to note that years 3-10 and also year 12 is strictly Christianity, and year 11 is 2/3 Christianity and 1/3 other religions, of which we skip a lot and basically just talk very briefly about Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism, probably making many wrong assumptions about them in the process
As to your second question, because our Karens think we have to and Karens are the only ones who bother to vote, so the system appeases them
Yes, and Idk why
If we were learning about every religion in the world,that would make sense
But no we only have orthodox Christianity, basically being shoved down our throats
Ffs
yes, i don't know how to justify it but we teach Greek Orthodox Christianity and recently we started learnign about other Religions too and how they differ from ours
also if a student doesn't belive in god or believes in a diffrent religion their parents have to sign a paper so they can be excused from that lesson
Yes, we learn about Christianity in primary and middle school and in high-school we study "Theology", meaning that we touch on other religions too (mostly Abrahamic)
Yes
A couple years ago, when we had a center-left wing government they tried to remove it but most of the people lost their mind, thus nothing changed
Of course they teach us about our own religion, not all famous ones or something
Sadly, religion is a big part of our country
We have a teacher who is willing to debate with the students(about abortion, homosexuality etc)
When she says stuff like "I don't believe there can be an atheist person" you kinda understand how close-minded and dumb  she is
When you meet a European you need to give them a kiss in the cheek even if you never met them before
If you were to move your country's capital, which city would you choose
and why
In Greece other option is Thessaloniki
Is the second largest city with about a million people and basically is de facto the “capital” of Northern Greece
Also is closer to other European states like Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania in comparison with Athens
I say we move it every year with a torch
If someone steals the torch and moves it to their city then that becomes the capital
Just to make it as hectic, confusing and annoying for them as they make it for us
The only possible candidate is Thessaloniki but it's too far north , anything other than Athens doesn't make much sense economically, geographically and even Strategically
αν θεωρησουμε οτι θα ειχε και τον ιδιο πληθυσμο με Αθηνα τοτε η Λαρισα. ειναι η καλυτερη περιοχη για να εχεις μια πολη 5 εκατομμυριων με σχετικη ανεση χωρου.
Didn't Copenhagen make more sense as a capital when Denmark had control over the southern Swedish provinces
Nafplio, the old capital would also be a good choice
Amazing looking city with tons of history
I went to Milan last year and oh boy it was a shittown
θα έλεγα και εγώ το ίδιο. ίσως και ο βόλος, επειδή, γιατί όχι;
Sparta is too south and also almost a village at this point
Thanks bro
The name is great; the coal pollution not so much
Greece
As important as the colour of the walls in the downstairs loo
We are important in the maritime sector, especially to everything coming from Asia and the fact that we have the biggest merchant fleet
We are also a shield for the main bulk of current immigration for Europe whether you wanna admit it or not we are just here to play border guard
We are also a source for cheap highly educated workforce, in the last decade we had about 500k people leave to find a better future, most of them are university degree owners that see no future in our country
Finally we are a nice, warm and cheap location for well off north Europeans to retire to
Oh and I guess we are of a major importance in the essence of European culture, crating democracy the whole advancements int arts, science and philosophy that were the basis for much of the enlightment but that is mostly symbolic
Every country is necessary for EU to exist
Even the smaller one
Every member together creates the EU
Without EU individually we cant compare to other strong nations
We are so different but we are still the same
We use most of us the same coin, we share most of us the values of Christianity, we speak one language
We try to stay together so we can be strong and progress among the other nations
Without EU we will be unable to compete other strong nations
We can go to Space together
Trade in better terms with others economies
Feel not a stranger visiting other eu members
So together we are building all of this
I guess we have to thank Germany & France for organising all of it
Geopolitically, Greece cannot be considered “black sheep”. It’s not surprising that Greece was the 10th country to join EU back then
It's great overall, but also doesn't give you access to the entire healthcare system
In Greece, a lot of people also get private insurance for some of the private hospitals and clinics which typically have better doctors
Honestly, compared to what I was paying in the US, it's just incomparable for what you get here
personally i can't find any downsides to this
i've had 3 surgeries and i'm only 17, the only thing we had to pay for was snacks
i've seen Americans say that healthcare=higher taxes which is not that big of a problem
Dutch sounds like the same language from the game The Sims
I'm lowkey terrified of written polish
They sounds so damn nice though
Spoken Danish
And that's why I fucking love it so much, can't wait to be able to understand a single spoken sentence
I'm laughing my ass off,this description was  on point
Greek Civil War
> Keep in mind: I am Greek
Greek Civil War took place exactly after WW2
Basically communist guerilla fighters refused to hand down their weapons claiming that Greece wasn't free yet (referring to the people that came in power and also to the British influence within the country)
For Greece, there were more loses in this war than in WW2
Literally almost nothing is being teached about this within the Greek educational system and in a way it's considered taboo
Growing up I started noticing things (like bitterness) within our society that pointed out to this war
Also there is this hate/dislike towards the communists but it makes no sense
We have had politicians saying that they would prefer see the country in flames than empowering the communist party with their actions
Also politicians from the current government use the terms "left" and "communist" as if it is a danger for our society
Edit: mistakes
I would totally recommend "Blueprint for Armageddon". A series of 6 podcast episodes by Dan Carlin
Really the guy goes through all the major events of the war
Take about the geopolitical intentions of the participants
Well, my comment was more about the stigma that's left over from this war and the polarization that it has created within the Greek society than an discussion over ideological believes
Basically the war happened because the people that came in power after the war were the same people that controlled things during the nazi occupation
The communist guerilla fighters were the resistance during the occupation
These two points created a big schism within an already broken society which lead to a full blown war
During the Greek Civil War it was the first time that Napalm was used
Pretty hardcore stuff
The BIG problem is that there is no way that you can get your hands on actual truth
There is no way that you can find sources that are not biased over the subject
Same situation with the Greek Civil War
There are mentions in the history book in the final year of high school but they never teach it
You are correct
But Greece isnot like Romania for example, where you had a communist regime and so on
The thing is that Greece, politically, was always leaning on the right wing
We had a great number of dictators and coups throughout the 20th century and corruption was always nourished within the society
This always has had the effect of polarizing the people
Nowadays, the current government is very active on this part
Left wing is bad
They are spreading covid
They even use the political views of some civilians as an excuse for beating them up(police brutality)
All of these have roots within the Greek Civil War
Understanding both sides is vital to make the society progress forward and cleanse any stigma that exists
In highschool, the day starts at 8:15
Each school day has 7 school hours, which are 45 mins each
The two first hours and last hours have no break between each other
So we get 4 breaks
The first break is 15 mins, and after that its two 10 mins and the last break is 5 mins
School ends at 14:05
In Greece is pretty much exactly the same as you but lessons start at 8:15 (8:20 if you don't count prayer)
We start with prayer at 8 15, then go into the classroom
Depending on the grade, you can have feom 5 up to 7 hours of lessons each day, and maybe 8 or 9 in music high school and private schools
The length of each period varies; first is 45 mins, 2nd is 50, 3rd is 45, 4th to sixth are 40 amd 7th is thirty, though that might not be true for each school
Between the periods you have 10-minute breaks, except for after 1st and 7th periods, where the break lasts 5 minutes
A typical school day in high school and middle school ends at around 2pm
Fought a revolution against an empire while fighting a 3-way civil war at the same time and going into debt through bad management and regional politics, lost in military terms but actually won outright
The Olympic Games of 2004
Everything was done in a typical Greek style
Too much talking and last minute planing
Also, literally days before the opening day, constructors had to work like crazy to finish the stadiums etc
And yet again, everything went smoothly
In greece id say 15th August, saint virgin marys day
Its a holiday in the hottest days of summer, all of us go to the beach usually
Mostly we visit our ancestral cities/ villages
Every small nearly abandoned village hosts a festival with live music, food drinks and stuff
Its the day that everyone is outside, distant relatives get together and every village fills with people
i think it’s kinda both in greece
some people celebrate it and have dinners on the 24th and exchange gifts on the 25th
for my family we only celebrate it on the 25th
oh we also count the 26th as the second day of christmas
we celebrate Christmas on the 25th and go to the church and we get our presents at 12 am 1st of January
(this may differ from house to house)
yeah tbh it was surprising for me to see in the comments that other orthodox countries celebrate it in january 7
it was the first time i heard about it
maybe it’s just because i’m not religious
yeah well, most greeks aren’t that strict orthodox christians
most just fast one week before easter and that’s it
idk, maybe it isn’t as usual as i thought
but i know several people that have big dinners on christmas eve
[Only thing missing is a cane]
Most tourists in Greece go to islands like Mykonos, Santorini and Crete
Most tourists that go to Greece are British, Turkish, Russian and Spaniards
The tourists that go to mainland go to Athens and  Thessaloniki
Those are the most common places that tourists go to but there are more places
Definitely Santorini and Mykonos
Santorini for the middle classes and Mykonos for the rich
I believe when someone thinks of Greece, he thinks about Acropolis-Santorini-Mykonos
There are also other places, like Thessaloniki, which are too underrated
Santorini and Mykonos both very beautiful islands but overrated because all of the islands are beautiful
Santorini and Mykonos
i'm sure you all know what those are and why
Meteora monasteries are also one of the top destinations in the entire country
Oh yeah I forgot
Thanks
I would say I know most of the names of the states, just not always where they are located
most people only know the names of the typical like Texas, Florida, New York and that's about it but personally i can point out most of them on map (i have to say you guys were too bored when you were drawing borders)
also bare in mind most people can tell from a mile away that you're from the US, i live in a coastal city and i like to guess where foreigners are from in the summer cause they all stick out like shore thumb
> even Ross couldn't all though he had all of Thanksgiving
That's because he's a dummy, Joey actually got 56
Even their country’s name is an abbreviation
Can't really explain it but if you look at a German and a Greek aide by side you too would be able to tell them apart
I find it surprising that nobody has said Greek considering that we use an entirely different alphabet
Grammar and spelling is really where people struggle
Spelling in particular is extremely hard as we have different letter combinations that represent the same letter (like ι can be written like η, ει, and οι, all depending on the word and context)
Yes, a million times yes
I'm glad because my country would be far worse without it
I'm not talking about the economy,  but about the EU policies that kind of force the state to act more responsibly and with more transparency
I'm also glad because I really like the idea of a European Union
The fact that European countries have agreed to work together and that hopefully one day all Europeans will be part of the same union is amazing to me
The union isn't perfect
There are many things that I would like to be different in it, but it's a start
As long as we keep working together the European Union will get better and stronger
Why do you hate Italy tho
Ahem can I join
Thats sad man
Such a beautiful country
The similarities between Greece and Romania on topics like this really show how toxic the eastern orthodox church is
I’m curious, how did these people feel about loosing the war
When and where was he imprisoned
I suppose the French released their POWs in 1940 (?)
Add some romance in to it and you’ve got an Oscar nominee
Ye that is interesting
I have seriously been thinking of moving to Germany, and even though I know the younger generation is nothing like what the Germany of 1940 was, I still find the thought of facing the older people’s racist ideologies scary
The Greek Wikipedia generally has severely less information as well as articles compared to the English one
I only really use it for regional matters relating to Greece
Unless it's one of those rare cases where an English article about Greece itself may be better than the Greek equivalent of it
Because I've seen that too
i don't mind using the Greek wikipedia but i prefer the English one cause it usually has more info and it's more unbiased
It's completely normal, except if you live in specific areas where the water is dirty
Even then, bottled water is pretty cheap
Antifa and Anarchists love to destroy property in the district of Exárchia in Athens
In the Industrial district Asprópyrgos (west Attica) there is a kind of common problem of Gypsies stopping and stealing trucks (has happened to two of my dad's colleagues but they didn't manage to get the trucks)
Our capital is probably the dirtiest in all of Europe
Seriously if you plan to visit Athens make sure to bring a hazmat suit, a gas mask, some military boots, and a portable nuclear bunker just to be sure
Oh damn
That's serious shit
What's the situation with Organ calling all these emergency powers with no plans to give them back
How's the population reacting to this
Hate not being able to go out for a simple walk at night cause some stray bastards will fall on ya
Wow
...that's very sad to hear ngl, I suppose a lot of people don't see how it will impact their lives directly in the short future
Hopefully by the time they realise it won't be too far gone
Is healthcare expensive
Bydgoszcz
so Poland has some good ol big cities I see
edit: and the only city I didn't know in the list
given the opportunity I want to thank the european maps of Railroad Tycoon 3 that made me the geography buff I am
What are some tips for learning your country’s language
**Pronunciation wise:** if you can speak Spanish, you've got it
The only letters that might be difficult to pronounce for (non-English) learners are δ (/ð/) and θ (/θ/)
**Syntax wise:** there are minimum syntactic rules in Greek, due to the variety of forms a word can take
**Grammar wise:** have a damn good memory
Conjugations, tenses, moods, voices, word genders and exceptions for you to remember
But as someone else has stated; don't be afraid of speaking
Greeks are flattered, even if you just know one phrase
The accent is something similar to Spanish or Portuguese that's the only one I can think of
Spelling will be a nightmare so just know that
But reading and speaking is a breeze and we always appreciate when people try out our language even if you suck at it
So, learn the letters, then learn a few words and start speaking
We'll be happy to help you learn more
The reason reading and speaking will be easy:
* We only have 24 letters and you probably already know most of them from math/science class
* With only a couple of minor exceptions, each letter makes only 1 sound and ***always*** makes that exact sound
* Our vowel system is SUPER easy
All we have is the five "basic" vowels like in Spanish (i, e, a, o, u)
* Our consonant system is *fairly* easy but even if you struggle with some of them, no one will judge you and messing up the hard-ish ones **won't** make you hard to understand at all
* Greek always tells you which syllable is stressed in a word with more than one syllable so there's you'll never have any uncertainty about whether it's pronounced πότε and ποτέ.
Spelling is a nightmare largely because of 3000+ years of linguistic baggage:
* /e/ can be made with ε or αι
* /o/ can be made with ο or ω
* /i/ can be made in any of these 6 ways: ι, η, υ, ει, οι, υι.
I teach modern greek to foreigners
My best student only studied one year, and she said the thing that the thing that helped her the most was watching a tv series
She said it helped her more than the courses and the books
This is not how I learn, but it certainly helped her a lot
Try though I may I can't get the spelling conventions down
I never know which vowel to pronounce when there are two or more next to each other
I get that (usually) one is only there so you have "broad with broad and slender with slender" but how can I know which vowel to actually pronounce
Which of the four
I can easily say brød but I can't for the fucking life of me say hedder
It's the only word with that sound that I just can't get to sound right
I started with Danish
I live dangerously
Yeah all european countries celebrate the end of the war
Except us
We celebrate October 28th with military parades and patriotism, it's the day the Italians invaded, and most people don't even know when the celebration for the end of the war is
I wouldn't dare either
People would rather still use the drachma down here as well, but for *completely* different reasons lol
When you're going out: Take a jacket with you
When you're mad for a silly reason or when you don't agree with something : Drink vinegar
Wear a jacket, you'll catch a cold
Meanwhile it's 22°C
We say "were you born on a boat
Shoes with high heels aren't allowed at historic sites in Greece
Someone might find it weird although there's a good reason behind it
Mainly to prevent the destruction of the marbles you walk on and secondly to prevent you from injuring yourself, cause those ancient marbles are actually very slippery
"But I would look so much better on Instagram wearing high heals in front of the Acropolis"
If you get my point
I can but for many people it's extremely difficult to get everything right
The sound of "I" (as in "dig") can be written with 5 different ways for example
There have been answers about Greek already but I'll mention the opposite effect
In Greek you can always pronounce a word when you see it, down to the accent (or stress, whatever it's called)
Here's the thing; we write 11 vowels (α, ε, η, ι, ο, υ, ει, οι, υι, ω, ου) but only pronounce 5 (/α/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/) so when a word has an /e/ (ε or αι), an /o/ (ο or ω) or an /i/ (ι, η, υ, ει, οι or υι) sound you can't really predict the spelling, unless there's some certain rule to it (e.g feminine nouns end in -η)
Also, some words have double letters which are not pronounced as such
Άλλος sounds the same as if we'd say άλος.
Definately not
Since the Hellenistic times, η-υ-ι-οι-ει sound exactly the same but we still use them
Thus, when you hear bira ( beer ), some people write it with υ and some with ι = μπίρα - μπύρα.
You have the same problem most of the time with ο - ω and αι-ε.
In Greek letters only make one sound (with a few exceptions) and the spelling follows pretty predictable rules, so yes I can know how a word is spelled by hearing it
In English I can know how a word is spelled if it's used in a sentence based on context
If it's just one word and it's a homophone then you can't tell
I think yes
There are very few exceptions
Why would it be
If you replaced them with Vietnamese letters would you be confused
They just represent some variable
Not at all
It's easy for you to say that since it's your mother tongue, A in baba and a in Artekin is not the same though
A lot of people think so but for example, log() or sin() or even the common variables xyz are Latin and still people use them with no problem in maths
Don't know if it's poetic or not but usually in the army or old ppl call them καλλιοπες from the muse Calliope
Apparently this happened because somewhere the toilets were next to a statue of her and it just stuck
The place (το μέρος)
e.g. "I'm going to the place"
We call it
Καλλιόπη = Calliope
Like the 9th Muse, who presides over eloquence and epic poetry
It is an inspiring place to be fair
We say Χεστρα (shitter)
They used to have muse statues at omonoia square, that's where it comes from
Not to be confused with the three K's of white supremacy
Thanks that️
>Due to the existence of the underground railway it was necessary to create also an underground ventilation system and in 1931 Mayor of Athens Spiros Merkouris suggested placing eight sculptures representing the mythological Muses to cover the openings of the ventilation vents
Although the problem was solved, the result did not satisfy Athenians’ aesthetic expectations and the statues were removed
[Wasnt that bad] esp
if you compare with today IMO
It may not be my native language, but I've still forced way too many people to give "rød grød med fløde" a try
No regrets
I also like to make up Greek sentences with lots of δ [ð, **th**e] and θ [θ, **th**eme] just so I can hear someone without these sounds in their native language (e.g Germans) try to pronounce all of them in a row
This seems weird at first but really it's no different than "comfortable" in which the "or" is skipped (or just the "o" depending on your accent)
The Danish blødt d is represented in IPA by [ð̠ˠ]
The "ð" symbol means "voiced dental fricative" like in English **th**e (and lots of languages have it like that), the little line underneath it signifies it's "retracted", which means your tongue doesn't actually touch your teeth while saying it, and the little ˠ that's attached signifies it's "velarized", which means you use the back of your mouth a tiny bit more
I believe that the Spanish soft d is the exact same thing but without the velarization, just a [ð̠], however I've heard Basques pronounce it exactly like in Danish, which might be a dialectal thing
A basque singer, Izal, does that a lot noticeably in his songs
Also hi, we've interacted before lol
I've always wondered why the typical American pronunciation is perceived as the easier one
It's much easier, for example, to say "literally" in Received Pronunciation rather than in an american accent
Malakas: masturbator, person who masturbates (excessively)
• φίλε, φίλη (fíle, fíli) = friend
• αδερφέ (aderfé) = brother (this one's mostly for strangers that you're being nice to)
• κολλητέ/κολλητή (kollité/kollití) = this one's a bit old fashioned, kinda childish in a way, kinda r/fellowkids sometimes
It means "bestie"
• bro, but make it gender neutral (sis is rarely used)
• μαλάκα (maláka) = jerk, this one's strictly used on your friends, gender neutral (even though there's also μαλάκω)
• ρε (re) = this is a bit of a filler word, it basically means "you" and it's used in the Vocative case (when you're talking directly to someone) in informal situations, for example "Πού είσαι ρε μαλάκα?" which means "Where are you, you jerk
". It's gender neutral
• μωρή (morí) = exclusively feminine version of "re", less commonly used, a bit more aggressive sounding
Our Santa Claus lives in modern Turkey Kappadokia
Both of the saints that the Santa Claus figure was based on are from Asia Minor
Saint Nicholas for Catholics/Protestants etc and Saint Basil for the Orthodox
Yes, I should have pointed out that I was referring to the traditional interpretation of Santa Claus
Easter primarily
Always on Holy Saturday at midnight there's a vast cacophony of fireworks typically around churches
There is even a traditional "battle" using fireworks, called rouketopolemos (lit
rocket war) on the island of Chios, which has injured people/damaged properties over the years AFAIK
[Frankly, it looks fucking awesome, not to mention terrifying
On Easter on Resurrection Sunday
Well Sunday midnight
I think there was a skirmish with Bulgaria over a dog
Here's a few that pop on my mind:
1) One of the greatest Greek generals of the Greek war of independence Karaiskakis had some very memorable ones i) During a battle with the Ottomans, there was some resting time during the battle, so he went on a hill and he was showing his dick to the Ottomans, then someone shot him on the leg, but it wasn't anything
ii) An Ottoman Sultan sent him a letter asking him to surrender, so he responded "I asked my dick and he said no".
Iii) There was a trial on him and he was swearing all the time, so the judge tells him "You're 50 years old and you're swearing such, why don't you behave like your age
" and he responds "and you're 80,but you still fuck, don't you
2) There was a guy named Nikitaras, great warrior in the Greek war of independence, such great that in a battle, his sword stuck in his hand because his fingers were stuck and he couldn't move them
3)The dictator Papadopulos changed the divorce law for one night, so he could divorce his wife and marry his mistress
A lot of couples came the next day to take divorce, but they couldn't.
4) In 1967 the political situation was a huge mess, so there were 2 or 3 dictatorship coups that were being prepared
The Americans were supporting the king's coup and they were supervising the situation with American police etc and they expected him to do a coup during April
What no one knew is that there were 3 colonels preparing theirs
Eventually in the 21st of April, the tanks were parading in Athens
At the beginning, the US thought that it was the king, so they ignored them
But in the end, when the prime minister went to deliver the authority, the three colonels appeared and everyone were like " who the fuck are these guys
Yeah I believe a Greek Soldier's dog ran across the border and he chased after it
We've had a lot of people assassinated but I'm not aware anything like that
> Winston Churchill wrote, "it is perhaps no exaggeration to remark that a quarter of a million persons died of this monkey's bite
It was VERY unfortunate event indeed
Greece has the largest merchant fleet in the world
About 16,5%.
Greece is the most sexually active country in the world
(not sure how factual that is but I heard it in the past and a quick Google search agreed)
Constantine Kanaris tried, but failed to destroy the Egyptian fleet BY SAILING TO ALEXANDRIA AND FIRING AT THE PORT
Crazy guy this one
Also, a lot of people seem to be, whether willingly or not is a mystery to me, of the history and contribution of the Greeks during the middle ages until the 19th century
For example Capodistrias role in creating the Swiss federal state structure
>Only 15 % of the members of the Church of Sweden believe in Jesus
Wait what
How are they Christians if they don't believe in Jesus
Because
49,99€
looks way more appealing than
50€
in case you want to buy something
Yes it's pretty much the same over here
Usually only supermarkets give 1c, 2c and 5c change if you pay cash
Which makes you wish they hadn't cause your pocket fills up with useless coins
In Greece we don't have boy scouts
You go straight to the military
dude we have scouts in greece and are kinda similar to op's example, i was a scout when in middle school, obviously not as much nature trips in athens but many fun activities
Really
Then we have a really bad marketing
There are plenty of roman ruins all over Greece, the most notable being the Roman Forum, the Arch of Galerius and the Rotunda in Thessaloniki, the Roman city of Nicopolis, which is the largest archeological site of a city in Greece, the Library and Arch of Hadrian and the Odeon of Herodus Atticus in Athens, a theatre just below the Parthenon
There are also various segments of Via Egnatia the roman road that crossed the modern-day Northern Greece
Well not many early Roman ones but the Other day I went to a monastery built sometimes between 1000 and 1200 in Eastern Rome (aka Byzantium)
The forum isn't a unique structure in Rome
The fora were squares/marketplaces that were present in all large roman cities
I also forgot to mention the existence of the Roman forum in Athens but it's not so well preserved
Other fora can be found all across Europe and Near East
Trashy club music, but goddamn I love both of these
The version by Betontod has been stuck in my head since it came out in 2018
>[Dschinghis Khan - Dschinghis Khan (1979)]
*^(Moskau, Moskau, wirf die Gläser an die Wand, Russland ist ein schönes Land
*^(Not the same song, but it started playing in my head)*
There is literally a very popular Greek bootleg of this with the same exact music, but I have no idea what it's called
Σαν τη Χαλκιδική δεν έχει (=There is no place like Chalkidiki, a town/county with very nice beaches and very nice to be in all around)
We are drivers with bad manners
Everyone agrees noone changes
Everyone agrees that our politicians be they right, left or center, are corrupt to the core
Its also weird how everyone is aware and yet we fight endlessly for the most trivial political issues
Yes
People who say that about Chalkidiki have probably never visited Lefkada or Kefalonia imo
[There] you go, some burek Reddit wisdom for you
Personally I like my own town's beaches best (Kalamata)
But Chalkidiki has a special place in my heart
I like the islands but I'm more into mainland scenery tbh
Well, we do almost the same with meat and call it a souvlaki so I can't really express my confusion about it
still weird though
So there are places like Chalkidiki after all
Kalamata is not like Chalkidiki, I just like it
You put banana (among other weird things) on your pizza, everything else are just simple misdemeanors tbh LOL
Yeah we have those too usualy with pepper, onions, tomato etc
but you will never see mixed meats
As I said before, we call them souvlaki and together with Gyros pita they're our national food
I actually ask my neighbors to receive a package for me ,so yeah I find it so weird .
Also if you are not there or if the package does not fit the mailbox (which it's most times as we usually don't have the USA style) , the post man leaves a notice for you to pick it up from the office
No, they don't leave the packages on our doorstep here
If you chose to have it delivered and not picked up at a pickup point, they come to your house and ring your bell, if nobody shows up then they leave with the package and try calling you again to arrange another delivery date some other time
Half the big/medium cities of Germany
The general climate you get is that the whole point is to get from point A to point B to point C.
It's not a letter per se, it's more of where you put the "tonus", aka the emphasis of the word:
Μαλάκια (malákia) = Clams
Μαλακία (malakía) = Bullshit
and
Μαλακά (malaká) = Softly
Μαλάκα (maláka) = Wanker/Asshole (/friend, when you don't try to insult your friends)
Τρώω παϊδάκια. (rough pronunciation: troo paidakia, the o's in troo are like one prolonged "oh")
Τρώω παιδάκια. (rough pronunciation: troo pedakia)
The first one means "I'm eating lamb chops"
The other one though is brutal
"I'm eating kids"
There's a difference between ι and ΐ so be careful
You don't wanna be saying that you're eating kids
Even better in greek, we have 2 words that are exactly the same but have to be emphasised in a different spot
Mal(a')ka \[Μαλάκα\] and Malak(a') \[Μαλακά\]
one means softly, and the other means asshole
That's nothing
The tonus that I mentioned, also has completely different meanings depending on the situation you use it
τόνος = putting emphasis on something
τόνος = ton (weight unit)
τόνος = tuna
τόνος = tone
I paid 0 euros for my degree and I got 52 books for free (one per course)
In Greece universities are free, which in addition to the low prices here, make a good country to study
In Greece we have a system we call the "panhellenics" Where students write exams and try to reach the points each university/school/academy requires for you to get in
(If I'm not mistaken all are free)
Im pretty sure you choose 4 subjects to write idk I'm not sure I'm going to be giving those Exams next year
Greece has free universities, but I don't know what goes for non-EU students
Cost of life is also relatively low, though from what I understand the language can be pretty hard to learn

I love it when I stop thinking about a thunderstorm's immediate effects such the lightning and thunder as something distant, and instead think of a thunderstorm as the violently energetic natural phenomenon that it is
A lot of us are used to being sequestered in our homes safely away from all of it, but I find thunderstorms oddly primal and exhilarating at times
Objectively, it sucks having to move through one if you have to
Subjectively, if the day affords you the luxury of observation, it really is this awesome display of elemental power that fills your eyes, your ears, rattles your body and reminds you of the unstoppable, ever-advancing earthly processes that go on, and will go on in spite of you
yeah, that
They're cool
This one's a bit different but the word where "poet" comes from, "ποιητής", means "the one who creates" and "ποίημα" (poem) means "creation"
"Rhino" in English comes from Greek "Rhinoceros" which means nose horn as well lol
Γειά, το όνομά μου είναι Γιάννης. Χαίρομαι που σας γνωρίζω. Από που είστε;

Hi, me they call John
I was happy for the acquaintance
From where are you
Καλησπέρα! Το όνομά μου είναι Δημήτρης και είμαι από την Ελλάδα. Ζω στη Θεσσαλονίκη εδώ και 10 χρόνια. Είμαι 17 χρονών, και πηγαίνω τρίτη Λυκείου.
Good-evening
The name my is Dimitris and am from the Greece
Live in the Thessaloniki here and 10 years
Am of 18 years, and go third of Lyceum
Good evening
My name is Dimitris and I am from Greece
I have been living in Thessaloniki for 10 years
I am 18 years old, and I'm in the third grade of Lyceum
lol we also have this here but with balls "You've broken my balls"
But you didn't have wolves for a long time too right
Although I agree wolves are pretty harmless to humans
Pretty interesting, how many are there now
And if they roam outside the protected zones can they just be hunted
this is what always cracks me up from my time in the army: I served as a conscript and the training camp was a huge area and we were around 1500 conscripts
around 40-50 of us (not me) had a weed habit
things were pretty loose during the first days so no punishments involved
outside our quarters there was a small forest  and we had the afternoons off so we just hang out until night call
in the first few days we could see a bunch of guys walking into the forest and come back after an hour or so with a goofy smile on their faces
soon more and more were walking into the trees to come back with goofy smiles
one day we see our commander hopping into a jeep and drive fast in the forest
ten minutes later we could hear a rumble coming out of the woods and moments later we see dozens of guys running in all directions like animals trying to escape a wildfire
it was effing hilarious
>Nobody fought the Turks in the mountains
Austria and Turkey were on the same side in WW1 surely
lol in Greece everyone gets fatter in the army cause they order delivery food every day
Yeah I remember seeing some turkish loot in the museum in Vienna (or was it Budapest)
Oh believe me I know ;) We were part of it for 500 years
I don't think that anyone cares about that
I never saw an EU flag outside of photos or television
I think almost all places (public property) where the Hellenic flag is flown so is the EU flag
my neighborhood's school
Don't live close to any one of those
I don't even know if there are any in my city
Hmm, there might be one there but I don't think I have ever noticed it
"Dogtooth" maybe you've already seen it cause it's from Yorgos Lanthimos but if you haven't that would be my recommendation
"The lobster" and "voyage to Cythera" for Greece
I highly recommend the latter
Έτερος Εγώ (The Other Me)
It's an amazing crime thriller, and, in my opinion, Greece's best production so far
AKA "Plato's cave in the Greek suburbia with incest"
Ibiza and Majorca
Like we do every year
Also European women raiding Mount Athos would be fun to watch
Bielefeld doesn't exist ;p
so that we BECOME the aliens
smart
Yes, they actually have
But you know what they say "there is no force equal to that of a determined woman", not to mention thousands of them
There are over 1,000 monasteries in Greece that do the same thing for both men and women
You will have quite some raiding to do
They are both private property
If you bought all the land, yea you could, just as plenty of people own entire islands
You never actually own land though, the state does
I would gladly exchange Angela Merkel for Sanna Marin
I didn't know you were ruled by Hydra
• You can rearrange the words in a sentence any way you want and it will still be grammatically correct
• Unless the subject of a sentence has not be mentioned and is not known, you can skip it entirely and you will still be perfectly understood
The best way, actually, to emphasise who did something in a sentence is to include the subject in it, when it is not needed
• Cussing feels so satisfying (compared to english at least) for 3 main reasons
1) the harder pronunciation of various letters (b, t, d, r, k etc
) makes cuss words sound better by default
2) There are so many words for about the same thing (παπάρα-papara, μαλάκα-malaka, καριόλη-karyoli, μουνόπανο-munopano all essentially mean asshole)
3) You can use any cuss word/phrase in any situation and it will most likely be valid
BONUS: you can say "I fuck your
" and put anything you want afterwards and it will make sense (mother, house, kin, siblings, fridge, carpet, shed, ceiling etc
I love that Greek is a very rich and descriptive language
There is a word to describe any feeling or idea
I'm assuming this is the case for many languages, but since my second language is English, that's what I have to compare it with
(Not hating on English btw, there is a reason it is the global language)
The fact that knowing it, adds a whole new layer of meaning to many universally known English words
For example, Telescope comes from greek Tele (Far) and Scope (Observe)
Even though I've been speaking Greek for 20ish years, it still fascinates me to learn stuff like this
Just out of curiosity, to what extend can you understand each other's dialects
I guess maybe [κοκορέτσι (kokorétsi)] which is the internal organs of a sheep or goat put on a spit with oil and spices, wrapped in the intestine, and grilled over a fire until everything gets crispy
There's nothing particularly gross about it at all, but if eating internal organs is gross to you, then I guess it would be gross
I guess magiritsa (μαγειρίτσα) a soup made with lamb offal and -at least in my area- lettuce inside
We only make it once a year at the end of the Holy Week
On the other hand I've had haggis and its taste  reminded me of magiritsa
So I guess at least some people abroad would like magiritsa too
We also eat a lot of octopus (it's relatively expensive though)
Apparently many foreigners feel disgusted till they try it (charcoal grilled is my favorite, but octupus in vinegar is great too) . But they act the same about squid too
I personally just dislike tripe soup although my dad loves it so I have bad memories of that soup smelling in thw whole house, yikes
Many Greeks have tripe soup as a hangover remedy
Probably because it's so strong it wakes you up
Luckily I'm one of the few that never get hangovers
Kokoretsi, it consists of  lamb or goat intestines wrapped around seasoned organ meat
This includes pancreases, hearts, lungs, kidneys, and is grilled
Many people in Greece love to eat it, especially at Easter
ΠΑΤΣΑ!!!! Also why did you have to say grilled  octopus, now I want some
Magiritsa is fucking **delicious** tho
Lol that's so dumb
Didn't the Turkish public notice the Greeks were still eating it
It's on my mind for days now  the weather is so nice, we were suppose to cebrate my daughter's birthday on the seaside in a taverna, it was her birthday wish
I absolutely agree
This year though it doesn't feel like easter at all
At the supermarkets in my town you have to make an order for lamb related stuff by the end of this week
It will get crazy
We're still thinking if we should have easter simulation or not
It's just not the same
We use it quite often
It has integrated into the greek vocabulary
It even has it's own greek version: Oκ/Οκέι
very common
everyday use and probably a part of the Greek language now
It's common, but we tend to use εντάξει (εν τάξει/in order) more, I think
Basically all the time
It feels way too formal to say "entáxei" at this point
"Politicians"
1919 war
1922 defeat
1925 dictatorship
1932 bankruptcy
1936 dictatorship
1940 war
1941 defeat and occupation
1946 civil war
1967 dictatorship
1974 war and defeat
2009-19 crisis
Other than this misery, the major difference in Greece between 1919 and 2019 is the population
The minorities were wiped out and Greek refugees from Turkey as well as economic immigrants from the Balkans took their place
He would have been familiar with the concept
I find Malta fascinating
Not just for the Knights of Malta but for the people themselves, hardcore Catholics who speak a Semitic langauge with elements of Arabic, Italian, French and English
A profundity of surnames mixing those languages, rather than a 'cohesive' surname logic
Part of Britain until 1964 (even though they voted to remain part of the UK), geographically African, but politically European
Only legalised divorce a few years ago
Live in a country with no rivers or lakes and almost entirely flat, yet somehow they've survived and prosopered
Was so overpopulated that their govenrnment has encouraged EMIGRATION for most of their history
One of the weirder European stories I read recently was that Hitler promised the Cossacks a 'homeland' in Friuli if they fought for him against Stalin
In the early 1940s, thousands of Cossacks arrived in Carnia (northern Friuli) and began clearing it of the native population and establishing Russian-speaking Cossack towns
When Friuli was liberated, they went to Austria but were captured by the British and sent to the USSR, where they were killed by Stalin
[Stavros Niarchos Foundation cultural centre] is one of the newest buildings in Athens
It was funded by the Stavros niarhos foundation o wealthy greek ship owner
It hosts a lot of events like concerts, movie nights most of them free to the public
The new national library is placed there, as well the national opera house
You can find more about it [here]
&#x200B;
Edit: The photo is still from the construction phase
[Here] is an aerial view of the structure
Yes, this
Which is the view from my balcony
We have an island called  [Ρω]  (Ro)
Not certain but probably
Κώς(Kós) island which is one syllable
The translator of the first book of Harry Potter (didn't translate the rest but set a precedent with her choices, that were followed in the rest of the series, as well as in the subtitling of the movies) changed Tom Marvolo Riddle to Anton Morvol Hert and made a mess that didn't even make sense; the anagram was derived from Lord Voldemort and was actually wrong, since she used two ω and not one ο (they sound the same at greek) even though Βόλντεμορτ (Voldemort) has an o.
It has nothing to do with "my culture" or "European culture" it's the same to me as if something like that happened to the statue of Jesus of Nazareth in Rio or if like the Pyramids got destroyed etc
It's human culture and heritage being lost
Horrible to see
I am shocked and of course it's pretty devastating
Notre dame is a major cultural part of France, more so than the Eiffel tower
To top it, it's one of the most recognizable European buildings, on a world level
France, hung in the there ️
If someone talks to you and you don't talk back alot of people (especially older people) will think you are deranged
Ever hear the phrase the silent ones are the ones you need to look out for
The belief is lack of emotion and expression (only for men) = potentially dangerous
"I'm not going to say what I'm going to do" is like saying you are going to bomb them, everyone usually says a lie of what they are going to do even though most of the time they don't do anything
Based off that fake answer/emotion people can tell how you will actually react and that answer is never enough to actually do any harm to you or them
If that makes sense
I give a slight honk every time someonen forget to drive  when a traffic light turns to green
Face to face discussion sucks
I'm all for passive aggressive letters
People honking in traffic grinds my gears so badly, ^WHAT ^THE ^FUCK ^ARE ^WE ^SUPPOSED ^TO ^DO
Am half greek / half english, one of the silent ones
I never really understood this disingenuous talking shit and in the end doing nothing mentality
Its like the whole population is trying to seem like something they aren't, and even though everyone is aware of it, because everyone does it, people keep on doing it
Never made sense to me
Seems like too much extra work
Just say what you actually plan to do, makes things easier for everyone involved
Now realizing I've probably hurt a few people when I actually did what I said I would do
Oh well
I haven't noticed differences in specific aspects of mine when I'm speaking English compared to when I'm speaking Greek, but there's a pretty obvious overall change, it almost feels like I'm a completely different person when I'm talking to people who don't speak Greek
We don't dislike Athens as far as I'm aware
There's a bit of rivalry with Thessaloniki and people in the country sometimes get annoyed by Athenians when they visit because they don't know anything about living in the country, but that's it
I don't think Athens is disliked in Greece in general
I really really like Athens personally
Many greeks shit on Athens but imo it's literally the heart and pulse of the country
Damn dude, this is us too
Yes and a pretty one actually
The "[Koskotas Scandal] was and still is a big scandal
Im honestly pretty sure most of our governments crumble before tje end of their term, nowadays at least
In Greece, mainly due to the size of our tourism industry, the rise of the internet and also the need to live abroad caused by the unemployment rates, a lot of younger people can speak at least another language (predominantly English) to some extent
So, it isn't a particularly noteworthy skill, although having a high degree of competence is a differentiating factor
It's widely considered as a must-do thing here as a lot of young people travel abroad to make a living and sometimes come back to have a comfortable life here
My sister moved to Germany last year actually
In Greece learning English is a thing for years now and most of us are fluent with a slightly accent
A lot of people around 11 years old are starting learning German or French
It's not expected of older people but when ⅓ of your economy revolves around tourism, chances are you will be able to hold a basic conversation with the majority
I'll go for 2 people, because they go as a pair
Bogdanos and A. Georgiadis
Their IQ combined is lower even than their shoe size
George Soros would be my first choice
But him alone isn't enough, I have plenty more
I can't decide if I want to ban Tsipras or Erdogan
Isn't that the surname of that serial killer also
One more reason I guess
Um, we are living proof that it actually can ..
You can have him for free
I don't think we have any such laws
BUT
Our priests may not proceed to baptize a child, if they don't have a "Christian" name
For the past five year it has become fashionable, to name your child an ancient Greek name,like Orestes or Electra
But most of the time you have to also use a name from an orthodox Saint, like Mary or Constantine
Hence, many children nowadays have two or even three names
I work with the programs used for the name registry
There are no official limitations
Foreign names are spelled in Greek so if someone wants to be called William (Γουίλλιαμ), his name with Latin characters would be Gouilliam unless the person can prove that a foreign legal entity refers to him with a different name
In that case the ID or passport would write "Gouilliam or William" (same for last names)
Apart from that, we discourage Greek born parents from the non official variants of the names
A person called Giannis is always registered as Ioannis, Vasilis as Vasileios, Thanasis as Athanasios etc
If a parent chooses to give the name with a baptism, which is about 90% of the cases, the priest registers the name which is always a Christian name or an ancient Greek name (although I know of some exceptions where priests became "creative". Until that point, in all public documents the child uses the name AKO (without first name)
Up to 1950s two or more names were not used, so a new name was used being a combination of other names eg: Charalamposotirios (Charalampos + Sotirios)
Also fun fact: we don't have any middle names
Instead we use our father's and mother's name, which is also written in our IDs
A Cypriot friend of mine (Panayiotis) told me he knew a Cypriot man whose nickname was "Navos".  "Navos" as in short for "Ναβουχοδονόσορ" (Nebuchadnezzar)
Not even kidding
Andreas Andreou son of Andrea Andreou and Andriana Andreou would like a word :p
There is no length limit that I have encountered
Up to 3 names are allowed and 2 last names but I have seen some fields having more than one name, thus cheating the system
We always use the ELOT standard, we don't have the option of doing otherwise (I don't like it either, ancient transliteration eg Athanasius is better)
I don't think Cyprus uses ELOT , I am only seeing Panayiotis with y.
I was discussing with some Cypriot friends about that in Easter and I was shocked
Everybody in Greece is really familiar with Γεώργιος, Αθανάσιος, Μιχαήλ etc
When someone calls and says his name is Θάνος I always search for Αθανάσιος. I think our system is better as there is a standard
If you're official name is Αθανάσιος, you can be called Θάνος, Θανάσης etc while if you are eg registered as Θάνος, you're always a Θάνος.
Also it is part of the culture
When your mother is angry and calling you, she won't be like Lefteri come here but: Eleftherie
It's pretty mainstream, but probably the Acropolis Museum in Athens honestly
Definitely the best in Stockholm (that I've visited
My girlfriend loves Stockholm's modern art museum, but I haven't been there)
I also really liked the Gustavianum in Uppsala
Can't pick a favorite
That's gay
My parents are Greeks of Pontic descent, and as a result are fluent in Russian (their families first fled into the USSR before going to Greece)
Thus when they want to complain between themselves about their children they start talking Russian lmao
Most often parents will know less languages than their children so no
We do use fancy vocabulary though for that
Depending on their level, I either encourage or discourage it
If someone can keep a conversation, I try to make them feel comfortable and speak accordingly
If they can't, I try to seemlessly switch to English
When it comes to correcting mistakes, I try to see how receptive they are of comments
Personally, when speaking Spanish for example, I love people correcting me because this way I will never make the same mistake again
Not all people see it this way though and we have to respect it
When it comes to helping them in other ways, I think we, Greeks, are really hospitable either way so it doesn't make a difference
Greece
Absolutely not annoyed, we are actually very happy when people try to speak greek
Sometimes it does, and I'll generally appreciate the effort considering how difficult Greek is when you don't grow up speaking it
But please, avoid stereotypes, it's just annoying
no not at all most people will actually appreciate it, but be carefull cause some pricks will try to teach you swearwords for example [this poor man] he thinks he is simply greeting people in Greek while he is actually saying "HELLO YOU WANKER (a bad word commonly used by close friends), HOW HAVE YOU BEEN YOU TESTICLE, PUSSYDOG" this video went viral in Greece and i feel very bad for this man who obviously doesn't know what he is saying
My experience in France taught me that it's best to start by asking in french if they speak English
Like you said, if you ask in English directly, they might not understand
Also, when i just asked what i wanted in french, everyone assumed i understood french well enough and spoke glouglouglou super fast, which left me looking at them like an idiot
So I'd always ask if they speak English, and jf they said no, I'd speak some french and they'd reply using simple slow words so that i could understand
Grill smells, particularly souvlaki/ gyros/ ribs smells, oregano, thymian and parsley, fish, sea salt smells, CO2/pollution smell
Also a mountainous, snowy smell for Northern Greece
*WAIT* How could I forget about our great olive oil and olives
And Feta cheese/ different cheeses we have that have this spicy taste and smell to them
Edit: added some smells :)
I was looking for the Greek comment haha
I would add mountain tea (τσάι του βουνού) but I think oregano is definitely the most characteristic smell of Greece :)
Was looking for it too
didn't found any, so I decided to make the difference xD
That's true I forgot about our great and mighty mountain tea hahah
Hahaha I wish I could disagree with you but if I had to pick the smell of Athens during the summer it wouldn’t be too far off :(
That's true sadly hahahah
Interesting
I would associate Italy with tomato or olive oil
But I do agree that we love thyme
What's it like living somewhere where the population is rapidly decreasing
Country, region, city, town, village
you choose
A fucking nightmare knowing that your nation's time is running out
I think all around Europe people abandon countryside moving to cities
Here it's even worse; apart from the two biggest cities (Athens, Thessaloniki) and some tourist places, population is massively shrinking
Mainly through migration towards better-managed European countries (UK, Netherlands, Germany) or US
With the current ratio Greece should be a circa 8 million country in less than 15 years, with a population comprising of mainly aged Greeks and immigrants
Yes but only the strains that do not smell bad like the vaping ones
One of the common types of cannabis can be smelled really far away because it has almost the exact same chemical components of a skunk spray
That is why those smell like skunk
Those strains should all be banned, all the rest legal
The Greeks taste like olives with a bap of pine
The Swiss taste like brie cheese
The English taste like grumpiness
The French taste like fermented grapes and body sweat
And the Germans taste different depending on the part of the country
East Germans taste a little bitter, west Germans vary a lot
The Bavarians taste more like Austrians and are very rich in flavor bc of the nitrites
And the northerners taste a little more bland but have a nice refined texture
Those are the only nationalities I've eaten so far
Trying to go for all 193 countries by the time I die
Or get caught
As a kid I thought England was another way to say UK
I used to think that because of Kaliningrad there were two dinstict countries named Russia 'cause I did not understand the concept of exclaves
When i was kid i thought most Russian women had red hair
Not ginger
Pure red
I don't know why
Shut up you egg
I first encountered the word Prussia in a joke
"Prussia is 3,14 times bigger than Russia" cause ρωσία - πρωσία lol
London, Rome, Lisbon, Istanbul, Budapest would be my go to
There should be an interesting story why adding a character that is not really needed is considered useful in your part of the world
Loumidis & Bravo for Greek coffee, Jacobs for instant(hot as well as frapé) and drip coffee, Illy for anything espresso-based (includes freddo greco)
Have you ever dated a person from a different country
What was that like
What did you enjoy most about the relationship
I dated a person from Finland for two years
I enjoyed being able to see the world through someone that grew up in a country so different from mine (weather, food, customs, views on life in general and what’s important)
I think for most people who live in tourist areas, yes, the best part was not having to verbally communicate as much because we both literally couldn't. Good for some, frustrating for some
Ahahaha λατρεύω το username σου!!
In Greek, we have the letter gamma (γ)
For some letter combinations, the sound of this letter does not exist in other languages (it is softer than the g sound in English)
Many foreigners (especially Germans) confuse it with the guturral r.
Once my girlfriend wanted to say "Αγάπη μου" (agápi mu/my love) but instead she said "Aράπη μου" (arápi mu)
This means my negro
I don't think it counts
But there was a viral video of an African tourist that was very enthusiastic about the Greek language and someone taught him some curse words having him think it was something else
In the [video] he goes:
"Γεια σου ρε μαλακα, που'σαι ρε αρχιδι, μουνοσκυλο"
Which means "Hello maláka, where are you(how are you) you testicle, pussydog"
And then proceeded to count in Greek, It's very funny but I feel bad as he was really enthusiastic about the Greek language
Haha, this happens when we write Spanish assignments on the computer
People type things like "cuando tenia 6 anos" and I wonder how the teacher never laughs
It’s the sound in this [video]
I actually didn't realise how foreign this generation thing was to me until I read this question
I've never talked about generations outside of Reddit and other online websites
If I brought it up to a non Anglophone Greek he would probably think I'm a lunatic
Age gaps do obviously exist
It's just that we don't socially categorize people based on their birthyear the way Americans do
That's not even close
In the US it extends beyond politics
Η γενιά του Πολυτεχνείου;
there is an abandoned mansion about 20 minutes drive from where I live
The urban legend  says that the mansion is haunted
[a news story in greek]
There is this Daveli cave (or cave of Penteli) which is said to have demons and stuff in it
It used to be a Byzantine monastery but now abandoned
How are jail conditions in Ireland
Are the inmates there dangerous and stuff
Right at the centre, under the big arch right
Half face is the stone and tge other half is the reflection in the water
Not British, but the equivalent of the word fuck in greece sounds way more serious yet you can hear it almost everywhere, yet there are a lot of greek words for fuck you and each is more serious than the last one  and can easily start a fight no matter how it is used
*Greek Cursing 101*
Omicron on its own means "the" (masculine), eta on its own also means "the" (feminine), unless you put an accent, then it means "or".
ο, which means "the" (singular masculine)
η (i), which means "the" (singular feminine)
ή (í), which means "or"
ου (u), which means "not" in ancient Greek (it counts as one letter cause it's a single phthong)
ο (masculine 'the')
η (feminine 'the')
α, ε and ω can be used as interjections
Beautiful
I was telling my friend how island in Danish is "ø" and his mind was blown
"Isn't that just a letter though
You've seen nothing, my dude
Yeah that's what I said
ο,τι is a pronoun and means 'whatever'
οτι is a conjunction and it means 'that'
They both sound the same and many people incorrectly use οτι for both cases
It's almost never brought up, but when it does, it's not considered rude
Most people can figure out your wage if you just tell them your job, your experience and your family status
>!It's almost always between the minimum wage and two times that, plus the children bonuses
We have the king of olives my friends, Kalamata olives
So, black are more popular
I prefer the green ones usually stuffed with almonds
Black olives need to be a certain way to taste nice for me
I was gonna say black olives and then I saw that you said Greece is associated with green ones
We have a lot of both of them, I guess
Damn right
Even shitty Kalamata olives are good
I was saying the opposite though, haha
They are considered black, but to me honest, in Greece we just refer to them as Kalamata olives, as we do for other types of olives, we reffer to them by name, we never say "black olives".
Yes they taste great and I think due to the brine the almond holds most of its crunchiness
[stuffed olives with almond or peppers ]
We also have those with the peppers but not with anchovies , I think .
Sadly, not really
Especially young children that would go out by themselves in other countries, like 9-10 year olds, don't go alone to school but rather by schoolbus (private schools) or the parent drives them there
We aren't that independent here from a young age :(
It depends if the school is in the city you have to walk but in my case where it was in the middle of nowhere we had some cheap buses take us
And don't think about the typical yellow school bus it was a regular bus that had a few problems
kindergarten and first couple of years of elementary with an adult/ older child
after that either alone or with other kids/ guys
Ancient Greek(stone tablets, scrolls, vases etc)I can read but I understand only a few words, maybe a sentence max
Many are common or similar with modern Greek but feels like a different language really
Texts after 300 bc or so are a bit easier to understand because a simplified, more related to modern Greek language is used
I can understand maybe a few sentences
It gets easier as we move to present day
Medieval text are easier still to understand at least get a general idea
In Greece we learn a lot of Ancient Greek in school, but there's so many forms of the language that most people don't understand everything
There's classical Greek, church Greek, Byzantine Greek, etc
I'll piggy back on yours since it's about Greek
- 1900s. In the 20th century the official language and written language was different than the spoken, heavily borrowed from ancient, so for me as a young person can have a few hick ups etc
- 1300s. Then with older stuff it really really depends on the text
Medieval Greek has no gaps, very stylised and has abbreviations so you need a lot of context
But I can understand a fair bit if its rewritten with gaps and proper font
- 100s Common (koine) Greek of Roman period I can understand fairly well at times, I've tried to read parts of the Bible in it
But it might be because I have a lot of context and know the phrasing used in the Bible but many similar words and grammar non the less
- 400bc
Earlier than that I get lost easily, like Attic Greek I can't understand, I can read and pick words and grammar but not general meaning easily at all
- 700bc Homeric Greek, same as above but no chance at general meaning I can't understand
- 1500bc
Mycenaean Greek, doesn't even use an alphabet
Ah the fonts
“Oh look some pretty text” when you look it from afar, makes you head explode when you try to read it
Greeks generally speak decent English, but a relatively common mistake is not knowing when to use "say" and "tell" as there is only one word for these two in Greek
So you can hear stuff like "Say me, what happened yesterday"
They usually use the definite article (the) for no reason even before names because it’s like that in greek
saying "sorry" instead of "excuse me" because they are the same word in greek
It's just a piece of paper covered in plastic
They've been trying to switch to a digital version since forever because the current design screams "forgery". Many people are afraid of the new format and think it's the "mark of the devil" or something, I've even heard the church discouraging people from getting a new digital ID card once it's required
It's so funny when you think of it
You're supposed to renew it every 15 years but no one does and I've seen 40-year-old ID cards used with no issues
The greek one doesn't even look like an ID card
Whenever I am in Europe people give me a side look, they can't believe that it's an official document lol
Especially, when it doesn't have an expiration date
I have mine since 2009 lol
[Here] you can see how it's looks .
It's light blue, on the front you have a picture that is has to have a Greek stamp covering a part of it, your nationality, your signature and the signature of the officer that made it next which municipality's police department made it
On the back you have your name, your dads and moms name, date of birth, place of birth and height both in Greek and Latin letters
There might be more I'll update this once I get home and have mine
I'm more exasperated with young people that don't want to change their ID card due to fingerprint or that the government will make a file of them etc, than old people who don't understand .
I prefer when going abroad and being asked for an ID due to my baby-face , to be able to show something they will believe is legit .
Now what the Church or some priests think
Whatever .
Also the current one includes
Name -Surname ,dad's name- surname , moms name , DOB , Height , where you live and which police department issued the ID
The new one is supposed to have far more information that will follow the Estonian model .
It's about time we switched from being stuck in the 1950s, but it is bold to assume that our gov couldn't screw it up somehow
We are supposed to switch as well, but people fear of it being "the devil's sign" due to them including the finger print, or something like that
Clowns
Not wrong per se
I meant the technological model that your IDs use as it's very advanced . They will used it as a base and include all kind of different information that will help with making online transactions with government agencies easier
isn't that kinda the point of the government
how do they think they can get married or be taxed without a file
-->And yeah , that's what I think too
1600 - no data
1700 - no data
1800- Bursa (Prussa)
1900 - Izmir (Smyrne)
2000 - Athens
2100 - Athens so far
For first centuries of Ottoman rule that no official data exist, sources mention Ioannina, Patras, Rhodes and Heraklion but probably that has to do with the fact they were the last Greek cities to fall
Don't wanna be that guy, but Monastir actually comes from Greek originally
It means monastery
Was there like a big monastery in the past
To be fair it's not like the two events are not related
Making it the capital draws people
Same way Athens went from small town to 1/3+ of the Greek population in less than two centuries when it was designated as the capital of the new Greek Kingdom
Oh alright TIL, again
Learning on Reddit is never ending surprisingly :)
My first encounter with English was when I was 7 or 8 years old, when My brother bought an Amstrad computer
All games and software were in English of course and because It didn’t had any ui, you had to type everything
This helped me memorize a lot of words
My first computer was an Amiga and although the documentation was in Greek, the ui was in English
Having the manuals in my native language and the os in English actually helped a lot to understand the basics of the language
After that I kept all my later computers and devices in English even today
My big breakthrough was while playing word of Warcraft thought as I had to type to communicate with my teammates
Movies were also a great help, since everything in Greece is subtitled
I can understand English just as well as my native language, but I never practiced speaking or writing just as I would like to
As I grow older I start to forget rules and syntax and a result it becomes more difficult for me to speak and write
I started at age 5, after I requested it from my parents
They were wise enough to choose native speakers as my teachers
From then on, exposure to movies, TV shows and the internet are more or less enough to maintain the near-native level I am happy to say I have achieved
They tried to teach us some basic English at kindergarten but honestly the reason I could read English from an early age was Yugioh . Me and my cousin were playing all the time and since we were very competitive I had to learn to read the cards ..
I think we had  English classes since first grade
The Harry Potter books are also a catalyst
My parents refused to buy me the books (bacause magic=Satan and other BS) but I was determined to read them so I not-very-legally-downloaded them when I was 13 I think
I was going in an English school but I learned English from video games, music and English news sources
I started when I was about 9
I learned pretty quick because I wanted to understand videogames, tv shows and browse the internet
At 13 I was watching full movies without subtitles in my language and reading English books
I once flew from Greece to Finland but my flight was delayed so I started speaking to another girl who was also Greek
She was a photography student and went to study in Oulu, Finland I believe
It was the winter semester so I’m sure it was cold but I followed her on social media and her pictures were gorgeous, so I’m sure it must have been a fun experience :)
Greece in general
While a big number of Greeks are participating in foreign Erasmus programs we rarely get foreign ones in the Greek universities
Poland during winter
I seriously canàt understand why it attracts so many Erasmus students
It’s quite funny because Greeks aren’t used to cold weather at all
We wear coats in the winter but even without one you’ll be a little chilly and that’s OK
I do remember going back to Finland a different year at the beginning of August and I had to buy myself a leather jacket because it was rainy and chilly most days haha
But now that I live in the Midwest in the US and I compare the temperature between Helsinki and Chicago often during the heavy winter, I would pick Finland in a heartbeat
Very few English-speaking courses and learning greek is out of the question, so
The chances of someone learning the two languages are quite similar tho
When someone is being loud I immediately assume they're American
Sometimes, there are certain styles you only see in certain countries and certain faces you only see there too but 50% of the time you will probably be wrong
Sometimes but not really
There's the obvious Western/Eastern and bigger Northern Southern divides but they can mix a bit
Coming from Greece you can take a guess with Slavic peoples from the haircut, body type, facial structure, cross necklace and clothes
Albanians can be distinguished sometimes if they are workers or something, more likely to be short and stocky with a rougher face and different clothes than Greeks, but can't really distinguish second generation Albanians in Greece
And Caucasus people like Armenians and Georgians I've only met a very few but they have different face structure all together I think, big square jaw, thicker eyebrows, bone at eyebrow region comes out more, different hairline
British people are also kinda distinguished
I think most ppl need more background experience to be able to potentially at times make a guess other than the general ones
I wonder what gives away Greek people
Sit on *your* eggs : Mind your own business
Go see if the boats are moving : Stop annoying me and go away
Are they peeling eggs for you
: What are you laughing for
I have to smell my nails: I am forced to guess, due to lack of information
To eat a bell : To get fined
(Curly) hairs
: Nonsense
For the one you mentioned we usually say :
Έκανες την τρίχα τριχιά,
which sounds like "ekanes tin tricha trichia" accents where you see them
This means literally "you turned the hair into strong rope".
Other than those we have a few very funny ones imo as follows:
Ζήσε Μάη μου να φας τριφύλλι (zise mai mou na fas trifili)
Live my May (the month) to eat clover - when something will take a huge amount of time to be completed
Πιασ' τ' αυγό και κούρεψ'το (pias' t' avgo ke koureps' to)
Take the egg and cut its hair - when something is too complicated and you don't know where to begin tackling it
Κοντός ψαλμός αλληλούια (kodos psalmos hallelujah)
Short Psalm hallelujah - when you're trying to prove a point and something will happen soon and the results will back you up
Κολοκύθια τούμπανο (kolokithia toumpano)
Courgettes (or zucchini, etc) tambourine - a classic
We use this one for whatever reason, mostly as an exclamation of "oh shit" or to call bullshit
ο καθένας με τον πόνο του (each one with their pain/issue) - when someone talks about something and a lot of people follow it up with things that deviate from the original topic/meaning
θα γίνει της πουτάνας (?it'll be(come) the whore's?) - when shit's about to go down
έκανες δουλειά του ποδαριού (you did a foot's job - no pun intended) - when someone does something (mainly a job/assignment) poorly
In Greek it is a hair and a rope
They sound similar
Here you go
I don't think many Italians take notice of it
when I was learning Italian I used it to look up the gender of words beginning with 'w' such as weekend and website
They were masculine as I thought, but according to the AdC they should take the Lo article instead of the Il article
All Italians say 'il weekend', 'i website' etc But the grammatically correct would be 'lo weekend' and 'gli website'.
Everytime I say 'lo weekend' and 'gli website' Italians look at me like I'm crazy, but I'm only following what the AdC judgement says
Huh, this is the article I consulted, which comes down pretty strongly in favour of lo/gli for W words
I'm with you on this one, but in the context that there would still be some basic rules so that the language each region speaks would still be identified as English
That's the best part imo, this is in a way what allows it to evolve
>Identified by whom as English though
I guess by those who have it as an official language
>What to do when everyone ignores these rules
Nothing
it's only a matter of preservation and better communication
>Why does it matter if divergent forms of English eventually come to be identified as different languages
I think I got on the wrong foot here
I am all in for the creation of new languages especially in times like these where globalization makes it all the more difficult for them to sprout
I am just saying that if we were to put some basic rules in the definition of the English language  we would achieve better communication
Not  to mention how much this will help with the understanding of foreign speakers of English who will now have a common basis which they can all follow and which would be largely agreed upon thus ensuring better and easier communication between people
On the contrary I believe that without those basic rules there could arise some major problems concerning the use of said language
For example, if a group of people create their own dialect based on the English language, right now there are no rules to determine if this would still be English or a brand new language, and so they could still identify it as whichever of the two
The problem is that if this dialect is to different than the English language (spoken by let's say UK, Australia and the US) people would not be able to understand it and so it would create confusion as to which language is actually English and which is not
Not to mention the difficulties that would arise in areas like government, economy, trade, communication in general etc
All in all, I believe that if we establish the basics of what the English language is, we would give rise for people to be able to identify their own dialects or even their own languages based on English, because this way they would be sure if what they are speaking is different to English because it just wouldn't follow these rules
I'm pretty sure this and many other languages that derive from others exist not because their language of origin didn't have rules but because its speakers didn't care to follow what the original language had
The fact that the existence of unifying rules doesn't play such an important role at the formation of new language is clear from the fact that many newly evolved languages were created from language which actually had such rules
In fact, in my opinion these rules will only be beneficial for the English language as they will help with the communication and it's understanding by people who don't already speak it

City rivalry in Greece is as follows: Athens vs Thessaloniki on the correct way to order souvlaki
apart from Athens - Salonika, Volos - Larissa was a big rivalry for about two decades
it was because Larissa is the administrative hub of Thessaly and they wanted everything to be there
for instance they wanted the coastal guard to be based there although  Volos is the  port with the sea and all and Larissa is 60 Km away from the sea
and this feeling of resentment of Larissa from Volos grew out in football too
but the last decade or so things have subsided
Athens and Thessaloniki for sure, they're the 2 biggest cities in Greece and because we have a few diffrences in our vocabulary we like to make fun of each other
Also football teams
Not just the football teams, I don't think there is another city in the world that claims to be a symprotevousa  (sub-capital
or something)
We also diss each other a lot for the different words we use, such as the souvlaki/kalamaki dispute
Γιατι το ειπε ο Μπάμπης ο Σουγιάς;
Well, we didn't just come up with this co-capital thing, it's a reference to Thessaloniki being the co-reigning city of the Byzantine Empire alongside Constantinople
My ex from Odense definitely agrees with you
Here we go again bois
Well shit, after OP pulled the pin, I was expecting the worst, but I'm happy to have found such an even-keeled response
Hopefully maybe a few more 16 year olds can chime in as well rather than the flame war I was expecting
what he wants sounds more like unification with Turkey
*with approval of Greece and Turkey*
What does Greece and Turkey have to do with this ?
But there is no state of the Northern Cyprus outside the imagination of Turkey, that's the thing
It's a military occupied area
It's impossible for Turkey to keep claiming protection and intervention rights without appearing as the outlaw aggressor to the eyes of the entire world
Since when are grey areas in international accepted borders
Oh wait since Turkish Leaders invent them in the 90s and almost start a war over it
In case you're missing it, nobody on the planet recognizies it
As for Turkey protecting an independant state, protecting it from what exactly ? There was no and there is no independant state, Turkey created an occupied area by having its armed forces invading and displacing civilians (to put is as politely as possible)
With your words you pretty much reaffirm Turkey's stance and discourse on the matter, so the discussion from my part ends here
No wonder why a unification seems impossible
No and it's deeply disappointing
The one exception I can think is Atlantis which was so strange to me
My friends watched it dubbed and the florist has a stereotypical italian accent in Greek, along with a very flamboyant type of speech which is just so foreign to me
in Greek it's been a long time since i last watched it but if i remember correctly they had a hippie stoner accent
in Greek giving Greek accents rarely happens unless it's "country accent" where they're given islander accents or Cretan accent , meybe even Cypriot
[Here is a video about Greek dialects and accents]
Greek has Cretan and Cypriot that are distinct dialects from the respective islands
There used to be three or four different dialects from Asia minor but they are mostly/almost dead because of the Greek genocide and uprooting
And then there's the two dialects which I'd personally classify as district languages but they are called dialects because in everyone's mind there has only ever been one Greek language, Greek since medieval times
But these are Griko language of Calabria and Salento spoken only in a handful of villages and dying with the new generations, and Tsakonian from a few villages in the Peloponnese that's thought to originate from Doric, one of the ancient Greek languages, so it would mean it split from standard thousands of years ago, it is also dying with the new generations sadly
Didn't even know Caernarfon had it's own dialect and I live 15 minutes from there
You mean so instead of being sub branches of it they are similar languages that developed together with and not from Italian
Pineapple was made by a Greek in Canada by the way
Greekness never goes away, ask a Greek
Joking aside I don't think we get blamed for anything really
There were people in the US who thought since my cousin had black hair, he must be Muslim
I guess that  but in Greece nothing really
Not the same really but some turks say that homer was apparently Turkish
I don't know how the got that but some turks actually believe this
That
was brutal
At least let them have their espresso first before you break their heart
It's still  6:58 AM there
Exactly
Fucking stupid isn't it
A website called all about Turkey is talking about homer
And they say he was born in Izmir
I don't know what's the deal with them tbh
Most turks are fine but there's a very vocal minority that has a pretty big superiority complex
I'm also from Asia minor so that adds insult to injury lol
It's posted in on a website called all about Turkey dude
Aside from that I've seen ppl on Instagram for example claim that he's Turkish
Now all tobacco products are 21 in the US
No you don't understand me I've seen people claim he was turkic ethnically
I've seen numerous dudes but ok
Yeah but the trojans could very well be hellenistic
And ionians are taught to be one of the three major Greek tribes
How would the ionians be Turkish in any way shape or form
The turks were in the Asian steppes when the ionians settled in Western anatolia
You made the assumption that it was somehow taught that anatolia ionians were somehow linked to the turks
Stating that in fact the opposite is stated in the Turkish educational system
If nobody thought that ionians where Turkish you wouldn't have stated the obvious
Alright to end off this conversation I just said that I've seen some turks, not all turks, claim that he is ethnically Turkish
In Greece we have this subject in junior high and high school, the name of which directly translates to "religions" and it pretty much focuses on Christianity, as you would imagine, but in one grade we also learned some things about Hinduism, Buddhism and Muslim (I actually learned about Ramadan in that class lol)
Most ppl don't care about it bc they prob don't care about religion in general but imo it could be taught in a much better way (aka why would there be exams and tests for that
And why focus so much on Christianity, basically making it like church but worse bc it's school
Doesn't that make it more unappealing for the students
I haven't heard of a similar subject in any other country but I'm curious to know if there's anything similar that I just haven't heard of
Oh we have that as well
What language do the inhabitants use to communicate with each other
I guess Russian is used as a common tongue
I was speaking with some Turks who said that in school they're taught that Greeks loved living under the Ottoman Empire and only rebelled because they were brainwashed by the western powers which is, certainly, a take I had not heard before
lol @ Turkey
All the time
Do you want me to go way back to the ottoman empire, the pontic Greek genocide, or are we covered with the daily news
I think lately we share a much more common view on these events
There were Bulgarians majorities and Greek majorities in different cities
Our countries fought each other on who will be in charge once the Turks are ousted
You claim most of Macedonia was filled with Bulgarians, we with Greeks, and Turks, well, with Muslims
It's the North Macedonians who have am entirely different story
I visited the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle in Skopje and it was a really weird experience
It started with an explanation about how Alexander the Great was actually Macedonian not Greek (?) and then went into an exhibit about how Gotse Delchev was an "ethnic Macedonian" who had no connection to Bulgaria or Bulgarians (who are basically never mentioned once in the whole museum)
Like, I understand that the museum tells the Balkan Wars from their perspective, just like the museum in Thessaloniki tells it from our perspective (and I'm sure that the Bulgarians, Serbs, Turks, Romanians and Albanians have their own perspectives), but I mean, there is perspective and then there is being totally divorced from reality
That said, I spent a lot of time in North Macedonia and speaking to ordinary people, many were embarrassed by the antiquisation program of Gruevski, and others took more nuanced views on the Balkan Wars, so I'm not blaming an entire people for their former dictator's vanity projects
Yup
Not because "they are not very nice", but because they are very comfortable
I use them practically like pajamas
same
Well I don't think Italians get offended by it, but we sing with pride the "Duce puts his uniform" a Greek song that mocks the Italians for losing the war with Greece in WWII
It's pretty funny because we sing it in the school events every 28th of October (Ochi day/No day, the day we said "no" to Italians)
You are right, but I wasn't the most attending when these school events happened so my knowledge is limited
Sorry for the (quite) late reply
CKII: I often play as Byzantine Emperor restoring the empire, or some local lord in Greece restoring Hellenism
I enjoy tutorial Ireland and raiding vikings
I also like playing muslims and get to control temple holdings, usually starting in Baghdad or Egypt
Merchant republics were fun but I enjoy them more in modded games like Elder Kings or the late Birthright
EU4: I haven't played much as I am missing a lot of DLC
I enjoy colonizing Brazil as Portugal and fending off Euros as Iroquis
Tried to restore the Byzantines a couple times but it's too damn hard
We don't really have long place names, the longest I can think of right now is Αιτωλοακαρνανία [etoloakaɾnaˈnia] at 15 letters
I think so yeah, in the Victorian times
But it's definitely old at this point, live next to it, there's about two three shortenings that everyone uses to refer to it
London; there's always a bunch of people in their ferraris zooming around the roads blasting loud music
I cant tell you a number, but I've seen a lot of Albanian, Bulgarian and bizarrely French license plates here
the ones i see the most are German Romanian Albanian and Bulgarian
but i've also come across swiss, Belgian French quite a few times
Edit: i missunderstood the question i think the UK and Russia take the cake
We say "Παπάκι" (Papaki) which literally means duckling
I have no idea why, it looks nothing like a duckling, but I like it
We call it "duckling" in Greek (παπάκι = diminutive of duck)
Honestly, it doesn't real look like a duckling, but I think it's really cute
On a sidenote, we also call "duckling" [this type of small motorcycles] which make up around 90% of motorcycles in Greece, so it could be related to this
It's pretty bizzare but really cute at the same time to be honest hahaha
''Παπάκι'' (papaki) and it means duckling
In Greek it's παπακη (papaki) which means duckling
Papaki (παπάκι) meaning duckling or little duck
It does look a bit like it though
(Lol nope)
"Papaki" which translates to "little duck" . I know
it makes no sense
Serbia, Italy, Spain
Serbs are our brothers because we have the same religion and we fought together in the Balkan wars
Spain and Italy have cultures similar to ours
I usually cheer for the underdog or Cyprus if they are in the tournament
I'll often cheer for Italy as well
I root for every team that plays the more attractive football/basketball (that's the only 2 teams sports I know)
I always root with the opponent of Italy, unless they play against Spain or Germany
I always root with the opponent of Spain and Germany
In football I always root with the opponent of Greece (unless it's Spain or Germany)
In basketball, though, I'm with us !
That's not really true
I find myself cheering for Italy, Spain , Portugal often
Unless we are playing each other
I know you guys are technically a Mediterranean country, but we usually see you as part of the Yugoslavian lobby
So propably just Italy, France (not always), Spain, Portugal, Cuprus and Malta (?)
He asked for Mediterranean and Southern countries
You guys certainly are a southern country
It kinda depends on the matter
If you are talking about politics or economy you guys are closer to the Central Europe lobby
**England (a small West Midlands university town)** : people drinking in Saturday morning
Super weird
People thinking that "having fun" = "drink so much that you vomit on the street and then pee or poop in the bushes". And not only silly students, but 50 year old guys
drinking culture is one thing, making yourself like this is another
**Spain (Zaragoza)**: it is literally impossible to get something you need/want done on time
Official schedules aren't followed, half the people are never on time, organization is non-existent
Also, people going out every day for tapas/partying/"light drinking". I loved that part
**Germany (Stuttgart)** : the city gives vibes of a big village
The people are not social at all, obsessed with every small rule they have, either written or unspoken
Eeerie silence in parks and trains
Great public transport (although expensive)
Germans from Stuttgart were like completely different people from the ones I had met abroad (and happened to be from Berlin and Cologne)
**Ireland (Dublin) :** huge amount of Brazilians
I knew about Polish and Lithuanians having a presence in Dublin, but not about Brazilians
You hear Portuguese on the street everywhere
The streets are generally clean, much better than what I expected (I expected something like Leeds or Sheffield)
The city is bipolar : it has beautiful parts that are amazing to walk, chat, see, do stuff, and parts that look like an abandoned dangerous industrial zone with shady personalities lurking in the corners (although nothing has even happened to me)
i havn't gone outside of Greece yet but my sister moved to Germany  a year ago and when my mom went to visit her (has never traveled, is very religious, and doesn't speak english, doesn't really like Germany) she said that it was very clean but everything seemed boring and lifeless, she also said the people seemed like robots and emotionless
i know her view might be seen as offensive but it's cool to see the mind of an old conservative Cretan Greek lady who only believes what facebook tells her
That's most of Europe except Germanic and Scandinavian countries to be honest
It is you who are anti-small talk :)
Is this the last meal of the day then
I mean supposing you go to sleep around 23:00, aren't you awfully hungry again by then

Our microstate is the Mt
Athos monastic community
There are literally trillions of Euros stashed there in gold silver and the like
Plus you know no separation of church and state
I don't know if its the only place, but yeah women aren't allowed there
Well something something Turkey
Propably turkey
Hmm sounds good
Austria wants to start another world war, what's new
The people were very keen to follow the politicians last time though
Yes we have patsadika where you can eat things like fasolada(bean soup), patsas which is a soup that contains stomach and other unused parts of the animal, fakes(lentils) and other similar traditional dishes at a very low price, these are usually associated with the working class
No by the concept per ce as milk bars
We have what we call in Greece "Magiria". There are like tavernas, but they serve only traditional Greek food and especially "daily" picks (meaning that they don't have stable menu dishes, but they cook every day fresh dishes)
They serve alcohol
Cozy little places, with better food than tavernas, most of the time and "grandma" cooking recipes
By the way, I am completely in love with your country and its people
I love Warsaw

In Greece it's called a "σκονάκι" (skonáki - /s̠ɡ̥o̞ˈnɐci/)
It literally means "little dust", I have no idea why we call it that
Edit: Apparently according to another commenter it means "a small dose of medicine or drug in powder form". Interesting
In Greek it's "skonaki". I don't know the etymology of the word, but it roughly translates in "little/small dust".
we call it "σκονάκι" (skonaki) meaning pouder with the ending -aki indicating it's small
In Greek its called "σκονάκι" which literally means "dust" from σκόνη and - άκι which is a diminutive
So it's like saying  "small dust" xD
I legit thought σκονακι means little dust
i remember an old movie where the students cheats on their finals exams (I think it was ροδα τσαντα και κοπανα) and the teacher asks a student "what's that on your desk" and she replies "σκονακι για τα δοντια μου" and then she opens it and it's actually filled with powder . That's the one time i have seen it used literally
Wow that's interesting
>It's a shame we don't have sufficiently large databases for the Greek language to investigate when the modern sense of the word was first used
couldn't have said it better
It really bothered me when I was in school because I always saw them in movies, but now I realise it's because we had all of our classes in the same room, so we could just leave everything on our desks
Nop and after i started high school I just left all the *useless* books below my desk
I won't carry them back and forth from my house for no reason and apart for those I literally can't think of anything I would have a locker for
We have most of our classes in the same room
It really bothers me though cos I don't want to - and, frankly, don't need to - carry much wait on my back daily since I already have spinal problems
No public school in greece has lockers, everyone carries their books in backpacks
Though you can leave your books on a shelf under your desk
We have backpacks in which we bring all our books for the day
Lockers are frankly regarded as something exclusively American
Personally, I've carried a bag weighing about 8-10kg back and forth from school everyday for 11 years now
At this point I can hear my back begging me to drop out
The high school i went to had lockers for books for every student
It is actually really convinient not to carry a heavy backpack all the time
No, we just carried the books in our backpacks
Although the desk had something underneath it where you could put books and many students (especially those who didn't care about studying) just left them under there for the whole season
Γιατί σε ενοχλούσε?
Why did it bother you
Excuse me why did you take your shoes off at school
Exactly the same in Greece
Was it a private school
Because I'm pretty sure such luxuries don't exist in public schools
I don't know I guess I liked how in TV shows everyone decorated theirs and it just looked like a cool thing to have
You probably know that Greek schools are lacking in many departments so it was just another thing that we didn't have
I'd say around 7, but we also carry, however, some notebooks and miscellaneous stuff like phone and keys
Overall the heaviest load I remember putting in my backpack was around 3
5 kilos
No, it is actually a public school
I'm pretty sure that it's the only one in the city i live that has lockers
We also had different classrooms for each subject so that made the lockers even more useful
Not sure why the school worked like that but it was cool lol
But we really did not need it, it's not like it's something expensive to install or something, but useless for our schools
>That's just not normal
It is in my country
We don't just walk around school barefoot
Yes and yes
My kindergarden had a playground and gym equipment outdoors, and the indoors was for reading, eating, painting etc
So our shoes didn't touch anything other than the floor when we were indoors
You don't go to kindergarden when you're 1-2, you go at 4-5
- 10^6 = ekatommýrio
- 10^9 = disekatommýrio (Twice 10^(6))
- 10^12 = trisekatommýrio (Three times 10^(6))
- 10^15 = tetrakisekatommýrio (Four times 10^(6))
- 10^18 = pentakisekatommýrio (Five times 10^(6))
- 10^21 = eksakisekatommýrio (Six times 10^(6))
You get the pattern
10\^6 = εκατομμύρια
10\^9 = δυσεκατομμύρια
It's basically million and billion
No Milliard
Edit: Wow, it seems like Greek is basically the exception to all other European countries
I actually had never heard of the concept of Milliard till I watched a numberphile video on it
Million and Billion had made the most sense to me, since that is what I had learnt both in English and Greek
In Greece itself δισεκατομμύριο is translated to billion and corresponds to the order of nine zeroes
This is the order commonly cited in the news when referencing numbers pertaining to national finances, so there really is no common confusion about what it means
The word for million is εκατομμύριο and literally means one hundred times ten thousand
Billion (10\^9) is twice-million (δισεκατομμύριο/disekatomirio), trillion (10\^12) is thrice-million (τρισεκατομμύριο/trisekatomirio), and so forth
edit: Hadn't head of long scale numbering unitl now, can't see how calling a quadrilion a "billiard" makes more sense but I guess I'm just not used to it
Catacomb (Κατακόμβη) - The term catacomb is derived from the greek *κατά* and the latin *cuba* which is a loan from the greek *κύμβη* which means *tumulus*.
Not many have been saved in Greece
The most well-known is the one at Thessaloniki and the one at the island of Milos
First Christians found refuge, prayed and finally had the grave for their material body
Milos Catacombs: [
We don’t have Catacombs but Athens does have underground passages which were used for safety during the World Wars
Theres quite a few articles about them, in greek, but they can’t be visited
Only in private tours if you ever find them — I actually have spotted a couple on Facebook from some recreational groups I follow
We have the oldest records of a language still spoken today, from 1500BC clay tablets written in Linear B. Id say we stand out because we've have a continuous culture and language since the bronze age
Southeast\*
Yup, Greece
Mycenaean Greek was written in a pre alphabet script that was decoded about 100 years ago, confirming it as Greek
That's Linear B. There's Linear A from Crete that's still uncracked and it's quite likely because it's not Greek as there's evidence that a language shift towards Greek might have happened during the bronze age
For me at least it goes as such: post Byzantine Greek (1453AD +), I understand just fine but it's gonna use some weird words and what not
Medieval Greek, I understand with a few problems, although usually it's because they wrote it weirdly, without gaps or with shortened words
Koine Greek, the common Greek from Jesus' time (so 50AD) I recognize most words in sentence and make out the meaning most of the time, only tried reading it in the Bible but I'm biased maybe because I know the way things are phrased in the Bible
Attic Greek (400BC) I'll recognise grammar and structure along with words but it'll be fairly hard to make out a meaning
Homeric Greek (700-800BC) I think I'd recognize grammar, so verbs nouns etc but not make out the meaning cause they are not in use today a lot of them, studied it for a year in school but don't remember how hard it was tbh
After would come Mycenaean Greek (1500BC +- few centuries) I haven't tried reading or something but it's fair to say the modern Greek would almost certainly not understand it, but I think it's likely you'd still find roots of words and recognise parts of the grammar and language
So yeah even tho it hasn't changed nowhere near as much as many other languages Greek has still changed quite a bit to the point where it's unintelligible, but it's a pretty clean evolution from outside interference
The problem with linear A as well is that it's written in syllables so each symbol would be a syllable, this means that for example Knossos is written as Ko-no-so
So I don't know if it can be accurately transplanted into the alphabet
I think he just tried to guess what old languages are still spoken without much thought about the script
It's a very interesting situation
There's Linear A, but at about the same time there's Cretan hieroglyphics present in Crete
There's records from classical Greece that there used to be a language spoken in a few places that was dubbed 'eteocretan'  by ancient Greeks, meaning 'true cretan', but that was 1000 years after the linear A and hieroglyphics so we don't know how well related they might have been, there's a few inscriptions in eteocretan but nothing can be figured out well from them
On top of that Homer mentions that Crete had many languages mingled together so we don't even know for sure if eteocretan, linear A and/or hieroglyphics are the same languages
There's inscriptions with eteocretan and Greek side by side so at least it can be figured out that it's not in the Greek family
So it's anyone's guess if these languages were Indo-European, Semitic, but there have been found inscriptions of a Tyrrhenian language in Lemnos which matches with ancient records of a Pelasgian pre Greek language being spoken there so who knows again if it's related to that
Just annoying that it's likely we'll never know
Nope, and most of the bus drivers are assholes anyway
No, that's just weird
lol, nope
No fucking way, they are usually dicks and NEVER on time
*watching you run towards them and starting driving when you are a metre away intensifies*
If you are asking about the "Being dicks" part, it's hard to explain without living it for yourself
I'd say that they are very rude towards the passengers, so when you ask them something they try to not respond and if they have to it's a short and rude reply
Second, they are angry towards anything
And lastly, they speak on the fucking phone/smoking while driving
Of course this is a generalization but it's common knowledge that they act like that; most of them do
The time thing
there's basically no point to look at the bus schedule
You just go at the bus stop and hope for the best
If you pass by the sarting point you can see them all chilling and smoking when they are supposed to be already on the road
Italy's boot shape and Cyprus' swordfish-y shape are my favorite
Honorable mention goes to Denmark for being different
Way too square for me personally
As in the shape is way too regular, lacks peninsulas and gulfs and the likes
Turkey (and I mean Turkey, not Erdogan) is extremely direspectful towards international treaties and laws
They do foreign policy by bullying, blackmailing, threatening and invading, and they seem to think that this is perfectly normal and international law is "unfair" to them
They constantly disrespect Greek and Cypriot territorial borders, now they do the same with Syria because they do not like the Kurds
No matter what their problems with the Kurds are within their borders, they have no right to invade a foreign country, but when did they care about that to care now
Another genocide
It's not like it will affect us, right ?
Do you feel safe writing that comment on reddit
Which doesn't matter because foreign policy is not affected by Islam or liberalism
Just send strongly worded letters instead, that will work !
What about Catalans
Almost all the time, it's hard to get completely rid of your original accent
Writing
I *would of* known immediately
That was the point of my comment, you can pinpoint native speakers by their "would of"s.
It's a mistake that makes more sense if you speak the language but you don't always write it down, yet it's totally weird for English learners because you can immediately see that this thing doesn't exist in the written language
There is never a "would/could/should of", it just SOUNDS like "whould've".
- τινάζω τα πέταλα (to shake the petals)
- λέω το ποίημα (to say the poem)
- βλέπω τα ραδίκια ανάποδα (to see the radishes upside down)
- πηγαίνω στα κυπαρίσσια (to go [under] the firs)
- τα πίνω με τον Άγιο Πέτρο (to have a drink with St
Peter)
- μυρίζω/τρώω χώμα (to smell/eat dirt)
..to name a few
No phrases with "bite" though
Same in Greek
"Βλέπω τα ραδίκια ανάποδα", same meaning
My guess is that immigrants (or bilinguals in general) translated the expression from their native language, and it stuck
No idea where it originated though
I'd say Greek and German are pretty similar, definitely more so than Greek is to English
Yes, that's it
1)We have a unique alphabet
2) We can understand a lot of words from Latin language speaking countries, but they can't understand us
3) We are the first Orthodox nation to join the west and EU
4) Gun and ammunition control is ridiculous, but we still don't have as many gun crimes as other European nations(if any Greek question me on this, I am from Crete)
5) We eat a lot
Like, really, a lot
I used to work in hotels and I have seen the difference
Either we are the normal ones and the others eat a little, or we eat too much
Maybe south Italians can compete us, but definitely not the central and northern Europeans
Especially the Germans who take a family pizza and it's enough for a family of four
Greek music and dances are very diverse but still unique
Greek cuisine too isn't very similar to any other European country
We have our own unique alphabet too
I guess that makes us your colony
Yep, we do exactly the same
And then travel abroad and have to either stress out to find a place for dinner in our normal afternoon coffee time or spend the night on an empty stomach
In the big cities they won't close the offices and most shops midday though
I am from Greece and I definitely can say that we have a lot of similar gestures
When I came to Italy, I already knew most of them
Greece would like to co-sign this petition
Same mealtimes over here, sending revolutionary greetings
Just come to Greece and feel free to eat the whole restaurant
Yeah
In Greece the food quality just needs to be in a basic good level
Then it's the portion
We like having our eyes full first and then the stomach
I am not talking only about the law
Most guns here are illegal, but there are still  a lot
It's easier to find a good AK47 in Crete, than to do all the needed regulations and buy a hunting rifle
We actually mock Germans on how little they eat and for that, not many restaurant owners like them
They aren't officially
There are very strict gun laws
But in the rural areas, especially in Crete, there are a lot
I live near there, if you need anything dm me
If you come, go to local restaurants that are not seen easily by the tourists
You will be served good and big portions here
Can confirm
Cyprus is Greece too
It might be a different nation but it's the same people
We even have the same national anthem, did you know that
And, heh, Turkey is not European
Besides that though, Greeks and Turks are very similar, at some regards almost identical and the fact that the Greeks are European and the Turks are not, means European is only a geographical term and nothing more than that
So does Cyprus
Totally agree with that
It's the people's culture
from spotify and my own experience i think it's [Toquel, Sin Laurent - Pistoli] (pistoli means handgun)
Wait all this time I heard this song was not in English
Is there any remix of it somewhere maybe
To be fair I usually listen while driving or working so
Hehe
Thrace is full of muslims so it kinda sticks out
I'm from a village in Northern Greece, close to the North Macedonia border (Aridaia, a town near Edessa)
In the north part of the country, near the borders, there's a wide region where people have mostly Slavic genetics and speak a weird Slavic idiom (in addition to Greek, of course) that sounds nowhere close to Greek
It sounds like a mixture of Macedonian, Bulgarian and Serbian
My dad and I have been mistaken for Bulgarians quite a few times
For me Crete is even more weird
What kind of Muslims
Pomaks
Turks
Gypsies
other
A) It is the actual name of the region, it has always been Thrace, unlike North Macedonia which has not always been considered Macedonia, certainly not in ancient times, b) Thracians have long been assimilated (as slavs, Turks or Greeks), there is no one left to claim the name, c) we do not claim to be the heirs of the ancient Thracians, d) neither Bulgaria nor Turkey is any more or any less entitled to that name than we are, all three have the same right to use it because the Thracians no longer exist, which cannot be said about the Greek Macedonians
If any Thracian wants to complain about cultural appropriation, they are more than welcome to do so
Lots of guns and like family feuds
It's like Sicily more than Greece
Has what now
> another person shot at the sun because it was too hot
I see the spirit of Heracles is alive in those anatolian lads
I don't think Crete is any different than rest of Greece in that respect
They even have areas on the mountains that are proud to have never been conquered (by Turks, Greeks, anyone) and the police is still pretty cautious to go there
Anything by Sin Boy, Snik, TUS, Vera Lamprou, Derek Leontis, Konnie Metaxa, Popi Malliotaki, the singers from the Annita Pania's shows etc
This is quite bad too:
Greece only produces bad music
Late to the party, but this is good stuff hahahah
This guy, along with other dudes like that, are like the hillbillies, rednecks of Greece
What the actual fuck
Thank you
I guess
Yes but this one is a parody tho
Dutch rap is not that bad
Quite the opposite, Dutch rap is among the best rap at Europe imo
hahaha holy shit
Don't forget Skyladiko & Tallava
You would absolutely not do an one-night stand if you're living with parents
Bringing your long term partner happens, but I don't think most people would be comfortable having sex when their parents are right outside
I don't think people who live with their parents ever bring the girl home but personally (im 17) I just have to bring her when my parents are absent or ask my dad to take my mom and little brother somewhere
We used to have a Ministry for Deregulation but it got cut for budgetary reasons
I really like it, i don't think i could find a better alternative
The greek one is named "Hymn to Liberty" and it was written while Greece was under turkish rule
I think people here love the lyrics a lot but they love the music even more
> I shall always recognize you
by the dreadful sword you hold,
as the Earth with searching vision
you survey with spirit bold
>From the Greeks of old whose dying
brought to life and spirit free,
now with ancient valor rising
Let us hail you, oh Liberty
I love my anthem, its great and very patriotic
Tbf, dissing the Austrians was a pretty damn popular thing to do if you were a poet in the XIXth century:
>Through the clouds above he spots thee
>too the Eagle's eye while his
>wings and claws are growing doughty
>on Italian carcasses
[Greek national anthem (Hymn to Liberty), Stanza 26 out of 158
Edit: Typos, formating
yep i love my anthem
Not sure if they are exclusive of Greece, candidates would be:
\- [this] a 17lt olive oil canister, this particular pattern is the standard if you buy it directly from an oil mill/producer
\- [this] wicks meant to float on a glass filled with olive oil, burned as a memorial for the deceased, either on their grave or in a corner of the house
Edit: The only thing that we don't have here from everything that has been mentioned already is this English bird pie thing
I didn't even know such a thing exists
A Frapé mixer
Rakí in a water bottle
(Most) Távli board
Some kind of furniture from grandparents
(Crete) Guns
Shit load of Religious Orthodox icons
Also [this bad boi]
My suggestion was not concerning an oil can in general, rather the particular one
The logic behind it is if olive oil gets exported, it is branded, so the cans have the logo and graphics of the brand
This one is used only for bulk, which is a typical thing to do as many people have their own groves or families/friends with groves or just prefer to get it from their/a village
Also, a family usually buys fresh oil once per year, thus the 17lt size is so popular
The pattern of this can is iconic, you 'll see it doubling as a flowerpot and a designer even made a shopper bag with it
The bad boy exists elsewhere too, marketed as milk frother
It's like marketing Christiano Ronaldo as a basketball player
he may shoot a hoop or two in his free time but that's not his true calling
No native speaker, but teacher of English as foreign language
For some reason, Greek students love the word "nowadays", some of them will throw it in every composition they write
In Greek like with many other languages we just have a verb for the act of sex
&#x200B;
There are obviously many phrases for sex and off the top of my head they all use the "do".
**do sex**
I am not sure about literature, but we have the "yellow press" meaning news channels/ newspapers etc
which are perceived to not be very serious, which report news that are controversial
We call it crow language ( korakistika - κορακίστικα ) and we add **ka** every syllable
Yes, we have something called ''podana''. Basically you just cut the word in half and you put the last half in front of the word
The name comes from the word ''upside down'' (anapoda) which is in podana itself
We mainly used it in high school if we didn't want the teacher to know what we were saying
For example: Ti ora einai (What time is it
) = It rao naiei (Tawh meti se ti
Yep
We have "κορακίστικα" (Raven language)
You add a "tsi" in front of every syllable
There are some variations but this is the one I knew as a kid
>  Sweden
Alternatively you can speak Danish and you'll get the same reactions
Sounds similar to what I was about to say about Greek
It works that way, it is called korakistika, which translates to crow's language
Either Alexander not dying early, or having emperor Romanos winning Manzikert
Otherwise, Greece winning the Asia Minor Expedition
The fall of Constantinople because it just seems more right if we had Constantinople as a capital because of our history with the Byzantine Empire
We haven’t owned the city for over 500 years
Also, it would be cool if Agia Sofia became a functional church so that I could go one day for a liturgy, that would be very fun
Personally, I would like to see what would have happened had we beaten the invading Germans in 1941
I think it would have a major impact on the upcoming operation barbarossa
Too options that popped in my mind would be
a) we don't interfere and back Greek nationalist groups in Cyprus cause that's what sparked the war in Cyprus, if we didn't do that Cyprus would be united fully independent with Turkish and Greek Cypriots coexisting (we had a military junta at the time)
b) 1941 when yugoslavia joined the war the Greek command trusted that Yugoslavia would hold out for a while and left no armies on the yugoslav Greek border, so when yugoslavia fell apart all Greek armies in Macedonia and Epirus where surrounded, if we had done that maybe we could've held on longer the last Allied foothold in mainland Europe and without the occupation there wouldn't have been so many Greek civilian deaths (the Greek army was pretty capable and if they weren't surrounded defense was easy on such a terrain, a terrain where blitzkrieg isn't possible)
Maybe I could think of some better stuff but I don't know
Oh boy where do I start
Probably I would change the fact that Venizelos gave the non Greeks the right to vote, because when he gave them the right to vote, they voted for the opposite party which promised that they would end the micro Asia war, but instead they continued it and reached the war outside of Ankara and the west then abandoned us, we run out of bullets and the rest is history
If that wouldn't happen, we would have kept now Izmir
Also if I could, I would make the 1974 dictatorship of Greece to not trust the Americans when they promised that they would protect Cyprus
But eventually they did and the invasion happened
I disagree on this . Poli is very far in our history and as the Byzantine Empire, like most Empires, was meant to fall
It seemed inevitable
If I had a point of history I would change (or want to see what would happen if it wasn tlike that ) for sure will be when Kapodistrias was murdered
I always felt he had dreams and ambitions and had he lived our country would have been very different
The murder of Kapodistrias was one of the darkest turns our history took, indeed
If we want to be realistic, taking Constantinople and keeping it has not been a viable scenario for a long time
Perhaps since 1453
But the coast of Asia minor as well as Cyprus would be much more possible
Anyway, I agree that your answer is indeed better
In Greece it'd be the Klephts and Armatoloi for sure
They were highwaymen and brigands that mainly existed in the more mountainous areas around Greece were the Ottoman empire held limited control
Armatoloi were the ones amongst them that were commissioned from the empire to enforce the Sultans authority in such inaccessible areas
There were many bands with important leaders, that fought against the ottomans and existed throughout the ottoman occupation from the 15th to the 19th centuries
They are very important in modern Greek history because they formed the nucleus of the Greek Revolution in 1821, and the leaders of the various bands often became the generals of the war for independence
i'm kind of confused as to what you're asking about but my best guess would be the of the thieves during the Ottoman occupation, they would go around cause various problems and steal as a form of resistance this was very popular in Crete [this] is a pretty good depiction of what they would generally look like
i'm actually from a small Cretan village that was popular for being the capital of these thief groups called [Gonies (meaning peaks)]
Bottled water, retail price outside supermarkets
50 cents for a small bottle (500ml) and 1€ for a large bottle (1,5 liters)
So every time I travel abroad I find the prices of water extreme
The most shocking thing is that a lot of countries have higher prices for water compared to sodas, beer etc
WHY
In Greece you can't sell 0,5l of water for more than 50 cents and 1l for more than 1 euro
Yeah man, and you find them even cheaper, paradoxically in airports for example haha
It's considered a necessity/essential product so it's price is fixed
100% agree
I would just love not being poor
Even though Athens is the city with the most theaters i would like more theater opportunities and performing arts in general like Berlin and the England in general
I wish we could copy Norway's policies and Netherlands' bike-friendliness
(Greek-Italian here)
I would love the cleanliness and the organisation of Japanese culture
Estonia's public debt I guess (and the digital government thing probably)
Germany‘s respect for rules
In Greece many people think they’re above the law
Being an actor in Greece is a drama
Got ya mate
I respect your opinion but please no
Look at the Fin guy flexing his seasons there
Average sunshine days are similar in Greece and Portugal and there are many forest fires and droughts here too, many times deadly
BUT it’s still worth it, sunshine has a positive effect on people’s mental and physical health
say that brotha
Ok, ok I get what you said, and it’s the same here, but in my opinion it’s better to put sunscreen and a hat, or have the car seats be untouchable because of the heat or the tents down, than rain
My opinion, it’s not the best but that’s for me
(Edit: changed “beat” to “best”
Ouzo
It has many flavors,  Cherry, Orange, lemon, Mastiha, cranberry
Edit: It's a very strong beverage and always should be consumed in small amounts
Ouzo, Tsipouro and Retsina
The first two are mostly consumed by older "traditional" people and they don't taste particularly nice imo but the last one (a type of white wine) is widely consumed and it's a tasty and cheap way to get drunk *fast*
Probably ouzo (tastes like anise - or whatever you mix it with), tsipouro (tastes like rubbing alcohol - goes great with some seafood on the side) and raki (noone has managed to remember what it tastes like - or anything else for that matter)
It also accounts for some of the worst hangovers, but it is awesome with grilled octopus so we forgive it haha
Edit: Good thinking from your part for adding the dosage caution
Retsina is love, Retsina is life
Never tasted it nor I will ever
They do exist but they are in fact not so common (except maybe the mastiha one) and actually only the anise flavoured ouzo (which is the most popular) is considered by many Greeks to be the one and only true ouzo
I don't like it either
I found this on Wikipedia:
On October 25, 2006, Greece won the right to label ouzo as an exclusively Greek product
[3] The European Union now recognizes ouzo, as well as the Greek drinks tsipouro and tsikoudia, as products with a Protected Designation of Origin, which prohibits European makers other than Greece and Cyprus from using the name
I wouldn't say it is as popular as the ones mentioned above, but it is consumed occasionally by many Greeks
I solely use it in recipes
All I'll tell you is that you won't truly know it until you try it
To me ouzo together with grilled octopus is the ultimate Greek summertime meal and it is also very popular around here
How come
Too strong beverage
I mean, normally you only drink a little bit, just for the taste as they say
But I guess it all has to do with each person's preferences
I'm not a big fan of alcohol beverages
I've drunk a beer once and that's it
English is probably one of the easiest languages to learn
Actually, I think it's more interesting that it's our country's name that is completely different
Greece in greek is "Ελλάδα" (=Ellada) and Greek (as in the language) is "Ελληνικά" (=Ellinika)
A few come to mind, not cities though
France = Γαλλία = Gallia
The Netherlands = Κάτω Χώρες = Kato Hores (although everyone calls it simply Holland)
Corfu = Κέρκυρα = Kerkyra
Zante = Ζάκυνθος = Zakynthos
Greece = Ελλάς = Hellas
Athens is actually Athena (Αθηνα) in Greek
Cyprus' capital Nicosia is a much bigger difference though: English Nicosia vs
Greek Lefkosia
Corfu is Κέρκυρα (Kerkyra) in Greek, it comes from the greek word from summit, Κορφή. (there's a story about why the French and British called it that during their respective occupations of the island)
Also not a city but Greece doesn't even exist in Greek
It's Hellada or Hellas for short
Officially the Hellenic Republic
after some staring at a map i've found:
Nicosia= Lefkosia
Corfu= Kerkyra
Beirut= Viritos
Marseille= Massalia
Brussels=  Vrixelles
Nice= Nikea
Plovdiv= Filippoupoli (phillip town)
and obviously a lot of Turkish ones have their original name in Greek for example
Istanbul= Kostantinoupoli (Constantine town)
Edirne= Andrianoupoli (Andrianos town)
Konya= Ikonio
Bursa= Prousa
Ankara= Agkyra
We still say Peking here
If you say "Beijing", most people won't understand you at all, let alone that the only word for "Beijing" that's typed with the Greek alphabet has so bad of a SEO and displays mostly random results if you search for it
I was thinking maybe Tbilisi = Τιφλίδα = Tiflitha
and Trieste = Τεργέστη = Teryesti
I am not familiar with their etymology though, they could still be the same root
Oh wow I had no idea about Hungary, that's even more different in a way than ours
The Turkish names on those derive directly from their old Greek names, I'm therefore not sure if they fall in the category OP asked
E.g.
Bursa = Προύσα = Prousa
Kayseri = Καισάρεια = Kaisaria
Trabzon = Τραπεζούντα = Trapezounta
Konya = Ικόνιο = Ikonio
Samsun = Σαμψουντα = Sampsounda
And many more
Especially in towns like Izmir, Izmik, Izin and Istanbul the names derive from the Greek εις την = is tin (to the) that was commonly used in front of the name itself
E.g.
Σμύρνη = Smyrni = εις την Σμύρνη = is tin Smyrni = Ιzmir
Κωνσταντινούπολη = Konstantinoupoli = Istanbul, was named simply η Πόλη = I Poli (the town) therefore εις την Πόλη = is tin Poli = istanbul
Greek Farmer's Market Edition:
1€: three kilos of potatoes
10€: fifty large chicken eggs
100€: two synthetic pants, six pairs of socks, a pair of running shoes, two boxer shorts and three t-shirts
Farmer's market means that you will need those 100 euros again next month
Unless we are talking about underwear
Or you could repurpose that money and have the smile of 10 million lazy filthy Mediterraneans
Frying eggs and potatoes gets messy
It's easy to make friends with the vendors and ask about the quality, and also easy to find cheap and medium quality stuff
Fashion-wise the clothes are always sub-par
These days you get a receipt for even half a euro's worth of cucumbers, so I'm pretty sure they pay their taxes
It used to be a lot more free-wheeling, though
Farmer's Markets are absolutely essential where I live
I've made the calculations and shopping for the same stuff at the super market would easily cost me 2X-3X the money
Are potatoes supposed to be expensive
Why is your Italian flag washed out
Not really but sure
It's a systematic problem over here; it's slowly getting better, but the mindset lives on
Looks like we're winning on the cucumber front
It's actually a turkish coffee towel
Cool

OK so in Greek they use the word πλάκα meaning fun and the song goes:
Το Π σημαίνει παρέα δεμένη
*F stands for a group of friends strongly tied
Το ΛΑ η καρδιά λαχταρά
*U stands for what the heart wants
Το ΚΑ τα καλούδια που έχει η ζωή
*N stands for the nice things in life
Στη θάλασσα τη γαλανή
*In the blue sea :)
Man I will always remember this song XD
Here's what Greek handwriting looks like :)
Do we even have cursive
Also, handwritten it just looks like this: αβγδεζηθι
We write with printed-like letters
Most Greek Children don't know what cursive Greek looks like (or so I know at least)
Just printed but the art teacher tried to teach us some cursive in junior high
Some Greek calligraphy:
[Cursive]
[Tutorial]
Everything's overpriced in touristic areas
The less the people, the better the place is for a vacation usually
This happened to me too
Dude put a bracelet on me without asking and I had to give him 1 euro to get rid of him
How does the idea of eating octopuses sound to you
I have seen some videos where Americans freak out while trying to eat an octopus
For Greeks it is a totally normal thing to do
Do you find it disgusting
Weird
Unusual
No moving octopuses here, I find that disgusting too
In cuisines across Mediterranean octopus is cooked with a side of vinegar to ensure its dead
Let's goo neighbour
Let's show them some great food culture xD
Sounds tasty
Then you haven't taste Greek or any other Mediterranean cuisine
Can you say no to [this] ?
Or halázslé
Yeah I miss the sea :(
Me neither
That sounds gross
For real
Much love neighbour
I hope this madness between us ends soon
I'm sure both of us have reasons to hate each other if we look back, but I don't think it's worth it anymore
Creta
The gun ownership, the mafia, the vendettas, the drug trafficking have won a place in our heart for memes
They are something like THE SOUTHERN STATES for Greece
Great stuff, great memes
Pyrgos, in Ilia is also one of these meme places we've got
It's like the Florida of Greece
Instead of the Florida Man we've got Pyrgos/Ilia Man
Mykonos kind of, due to most tourists being mindless party goers
Also the fact that it is a major destination for LGB
As you can understand there are many memes and jokes about gay couples
As for the 1st point I made, well, you can check [this] out
Most of the times, when a reporter is asking something, like really basic, for example who is the President/P. Minister of Greece, or a REALLY basic historical fact, the party goers just sound stupid
Thessaloniki, only to a small extend since their unofficial motto is Χαλαρά/ Chill
BUT, the rest of Greece, except Athens Metro Area, is making fun of Athens, just because it's Athens
&#x200B;
EDIT: Added some things
I guess Mykonos and to a lesser extent Crete, though I can't quite put my finger on why for the latter
Maybe Thessaloniki too
Athens vs
Thessaloniki
People from Larisa talk with an accent and cannot be understood (am from there, not true)
People from Crete as well
Mikonos
Larissa, people speak in a heavy accent there
what's up with crete
*Lárisa too, mainly for the accent
*LARSA*
Yeah Cretans are really great
You'll have a great time
I've heard stories from a friend of mine who was born and raised there, where the local gangsters would have great relationship with tourists and would show them around, have a good time etc
They are also great with people from mainland Greece
However they usually talk shit about them behind their backs
Even though what I said was true, don't worry, you'll have a fantastic time
Creta is beautiful
What about it ? I don't think I've heard anything about Ilia
Or at least significant enough to be mentioned multiple times to become a meme
Maybe because I live in the capital
Guns, "Masculinity" ? "Manliness" sound a little more like it
Fair enough, although that's kind of an every-small-city kinda thing
+Sparta
What
what kind of site is that ? I've literally never seen it before
I've never come across it
Though I don't browse Greek stuff to begin with
Well it is better than the country I am currently living in
I would like to try something like that of I had the chance, but probably go for Canada tbh
Greece might be a shithole right now but there is no way I would leave for the US  because of the quality of life
I would move to another EU nation though
I personally would love to live there myself, but I can see why people dislike the culture
Aside from no free health care, no gun control and having to pay university tuition, I have heard truly disturbing rumors about what the stuff  they market as "Greek food" is like in the US, and I am not willing to put up with that
Absolutely not
I don 't know from where to start listing all the negative stuff
First of all, the health-care system would probably kill me
But if the healthcare doesn't do it, the lack of gun control will
Also you a lot of you guys  are very polarised and can't have a civil discussion most of the time (for example the border situation, even Greece does a better job keeping the immigrants in a livable condition)
I don't hate Americans, but I do hate this  kind of culture
Although you do have  a lot of job opportunities for us Europeans, if we don't study there and bankrupt ourselves
Dunno man, Scandinavian crime literature is extremely popular in my country
No one does crime noir as good as you do
So, is this a thing there in general, or only some companies offer this choice
Damn you guys are light-years ahead, congrats
And here over half of the working population works more than 40 hours
Proof that productivity doesn't have to do with how much time you spend at the office
I wish it was too private . I know everything about my sisters' in law births and I really wish I didn't but that's because they are my sisters' in law
In my family at least its not an issue discussing it . Its better than not knowing because each experience was different so you learn some things
In Greece, or at least in the town I live in, it is completely normal talking about pregnancy and labor, but mostly among women
In older generations, women would celebrate their daughters' first periods and they would give them all the advice they have on pregnancy and labor when they were with child
That usually happened among relatives and close friends, but, if they were fine with it, they could converse with any woman on this topic
Younger generations are slightly different
It is not a topic that is strictly restricted in female circles and it is only discussed when the pregnant woman is okay with having that conversation (which she is, at least 99% of the time)
However, the gossip stays still, an unbending rock in my culture's traditions and so, while it is not so common to overhear people who are/have been pregnant or even people who are not pregnant talking about it with painstaking detail, it can be a thing, mostly advice to teenage girls and soon-to-be parents, or even a quick elaboration on it while discussing a related subject
over here there's no such thing as too private lmao
especialy if you're in a small town and you do something stupid everyone will know before sunset
Λαχανοντολμάδες αυγολέμονο με πατάτες τηγανητές/Lahanontolmades avgolemono me patates tiganites
Essentially cabbage leaves stuffed with meatball mix with karolina rice (local variety afaik, no idea what's it called outside of Greece or if it's grown even), boiled then finished in thick avgolemono egg-lemon sauce
I've usually had it with fries, but some just add extra rice
A Souvlaki or spaghetti with minced meat
Maybe fried dough balls called Loukoumades
Naaaahhh I don't think that would be most people's choice
Maybe chicken soup (με αυγολέμονο, δε ξέρω αν έχουμε και άλλη), or spaghetti bolognese
There's the regular chicken soup, no eggs
As for others, they're wrong
Still, better than kids praising fast food like souvlaki or kalamaki as the pinnacle of Greek cuisine
That's what they call it in northern Greece too
Apparently just a similar name
Yes, and apparently there's many similar words in the Tosk dialect too
Isn't that more of a pasta á la créme
Ok so:
Ολλανδία (Ollandia, which is Netherlands)
Λευκορωσία (lefkorossia, White Russia, Belarus)
Γαλλία (Gallia, France)
Ελβετία (Helvetia, Switzerland)
Ελλάδα (Hellada, Greece)
Κύπρος (Kipros, Cyprus)
Λετονία (Letonia, Latvia)
Κυργυζία (Kyrgyzia, Kyrgyzstan)
Ισημερινός (isimerinos, literally equator, Ecuador)
Many people still use Βιρμανία, ie Burma for Myanmar
Also, this is a huge taboo subject, so please don't turn this into a debate, but Greeks don't call north Macedonia as such
They will still refer to the country as the capital (Skopje) or FYROM
Most countries
Hell, in english we dont call our country by its native name , we just call it Greece instead of Hellas
Pretty much standard endonym exonym scenario
Well Greece is Hellas normally,so almost every country has it wrong
Thank you Norway
My format is pronounciation, meaning (optional) and the country in English :)
Yes
A lot of cities retain their old names, idk why, but for Istanbul I think it's out of spite and/or sadness (lol, as if anyone alive knew it as Constantinople)
Souvlaki shops are known for their bad puns, like gyrobank (sounds like Eurobank), souvLike , souvlucky strike and so many more
I'm convinced that you're not given a permit to start a business in the food industry if the name of the store is not some kind of pun
Don't forget γυροκομείο (gyrokomio), which is a pun with the word γύρος (gyros), and γηροκομείο (nursing home)
I don't think I have seen a shop with an English pun, written in our alphabet
Only shops that have a normal greek name or whatever
I left the Greek puns out deliberately
Well, it might be different overall, but in the area of Athens where I live, it's maybe like 40% English alphabet and 60% Greek
Though, most shops written with English letters are just in what we call "Greeklish", which is basically writing Greek words with English letters (e.g. θέλω να φάω σουβλάκι {I want to eat souvalki} could be written as "thelw na faw souvalki"})
Now I don't know what exactly you mean by navigate, but yeah, shops are very close to being 50/50 Greek/English alphabet
English is compulsory for everyone and you can then choose between French and German as a second foreign language
The teaching level is really mediocre though, so the vast majority of students go to private language centers (or tutoring)
For some reason I've seen a lot of hedgehogs the last few days
This sucks so much man .Its gonna be December here and honestly watching the world cup in summer is the best thing ever
Also ,I dont want to sound bad ,but cmon ,Qatar doesnt care about football and football doesnt care about Qatar
Probably because they are
They have better sweets though
Variety most probably
Greek here, Greek cuisine is definitely not heavily spices based
Herbs yes but not spices
I think that the main difference is methods of cooking, quality of the ingredients, variety of the food
Good food doesn't need spices to taste good
Greek here i'm not sure what people mean by "spices" but Greek cuisine is definitely not heavily spices based
Herbs yes but not spices
I think that the main difference is methods of cooking, quality of the ingredients, variety of the food etc
Good food doesn't need spices to taste good
Greek food is actually heavily on the vegetarian side tho
>Spain and Greece just fry everything
lol what
What do we fry
Oof, what kind of fish you've been eating fam :P
Αγία Ρωμαϊκή Αυτοκρατορία. (Agia Romaiki Aftocratoria) (Greek)
In Greece we call it "Αγία ρωμαϊκή αυτοκρατορία". (Agía Romaïkí Aftokratoría) which literally translates to Holy Roman Empire
I remember the term Αγία Ρωμαιοκαθολική Αυτοκρατορία (Holy Roman-Catholic Empire) from school
they didn't call it that as the guy said
they probably called them franks or sth
Philologists here will always complain about loanwords
Generally you won't be disallowed from using foreign words (as long as you don't abuse them)
However, using foreign words, especially in writing, indicates a low educational level
I would suppose that this stems from the fact that there is a greek translation for everything, so not using the greek word communicates that you are trying to make a point by speaking the other language
So would someone even say "jeg likede hans billede" despite it not being a Danish word
> “Nice” becomes “najs” and “mail” becomes “mejl”.
Oh god, we do that all the time cause we use a different alphabet and such
We say "Έκανα **λαϊκ** στη φωτογραφία του" (I did a like on his picture) instead of the correct sentence in Greek, which would be "Μου άρεσε η φωτογραφία του".
We also use "μεϊλ" (mail) and "ναϊς" (nice) quite a bit (the diacritics are there because without them ει and αι are pronounced i (like **i**n) and e (like l**e**t) respectively)
I think it's quite interesting because we're basically watching the evolution of the languages as they're interacting and influencing each other in many different ways
Who knows how each language is gonna sound in the future
All languages are undergoing changes right as we *speak* (heh pun intended)
I often get `νευρικός` (angry, mad) mixed up with `nevrous`. They sound too similar and sometimes I just think it's the same word
I could probably think of a lot more but that's one I could recall off the top of my head
In Greek we use the word lose to say we have missed something
So I have often made the mistake of saying things like "I lost my bus"
I sometimes mix Greek with English because I forget some Greek words and it's easier to just use the English version
Γατα which means cat in Greek and is pronounced Gata with the g pronounced like the ll in tortilla
I sometimes confuse English and Greek and I say Catα
I don't really have that problem, I just understand english but have a lot of trouble finding the words when I try to translate, in general I forget the Greek words for it
Greek lacks many vowels that English has, which leads to Greeks mixing up words like "shit" and "sheet" or "ship" and "sheep".
I learned French back in high school so sometimes I mix up pronunciations of English with the French equivalent
I also tend to use the English term when I can't remember the Greek term, though I am trying to reduce that
I'd get that a lot less frequently back when I didn't interact with so much content in English tbh
Nope, I can't explain it correctly
I think most people think very highly of a man named γέροντας Παΐσιος (literally old man Paisios)
He was a monk living very simply
People say he predicted the future and gave out prophecies, and they attribute miracles to him
Kiriakos Mitsotakis
I'm pretty sure that is the purpose of the question
I know one girl who's the daughter of an antivaxxer
She's been practically brainwashed by her mother
I'd say no, but Facebook is a thing
So I guess they exist .. somewhere
At this point I only browse subs about Europe and some gaming subreddits because I literally have no idea what people are talking about
Even in the meme subreddits I don't know what half of the things they're referring to mean and why I should find them funny
I'm really late to the party, but sometimes I'm surprised how much American culture has influenced our own here
On the other hand, it's still so far off that most of Reddit does feel culturally distant, maybe even more so this sub, since South/East Europe is really not portrayed
Holy shit people do love cats
I think people are scared of me, I think my voice sounds angry or snobbish
Probably I'm too nervous, since I rarely speak English, yet the media I consume are mainly in English language
Athens: Gray concrete
Thessaloniki: Prettier Gray concrete
Corfu: Tourist hub, good sightseeing, nice locals
Argos is just known for being old af
Only notable thing in Athens
Well going as a tourist you're propably going to see the bright side of the city
*Italy and greece cry in ancient*
In Greece the last part of a surname is what matters
My name ends with -ellis
That means that       I am from the island of Lesbos
In Crete most surnames end with -akis
if your last name ends in -akis it means that you're from Crete and if it ends in -atos it means that you're from either Kephalonia or the Ionian islands i'm not sure
Also -idis, -adis, -oudis are from northern greece, or from the black sea
Also - poulos comes from the Peloponnese
also -atos it Kephalonian
-eas, like Rouseas, from the Mani peninsula in South Peloponnese
Giancarlo Esposito is form Naples too
Well technically yes but like, over the decades and the years this stopped being the case
My last name technically means that I come from a certain place in Greece (as in the word of that place is in my last name - for privacy I won't say it), but nobody in the family is from that place or has any connections to that place
Yes
Papas means priest
I know someone who's surname was Hadji
name I won't say for privacy
Apparently that's because someone in their family did a pilgrimage to the Holy lands, Hadj being the Muslim equivalent that got used probably cause of Turkish influence
Not sure if it's Anatolian Greek or from Greek peninsula/Greece
The word "Lesbian" originates from Lesbos due to the fact that it was the home to the 6th-century BCE poet Sappho (who is said to be the first lesbian)
And yes if you are from Lesbos and you are a woman you are called "Lesbian" (Λεσβία) in Greek but in the last 20 years or so another word is used for obvious reasons
(The joke is ongoing though - as a woman from Lesbos I've heard it many many times
I swear Will Smith is also an actual black Smith
A quite handsome black Smith if you ask me
Dame tu cosita, ay
Vittu saatana
Vaffanculo
Voules-vouz coucher avec moi
Not the cleanest stuff, to be fair
Having money
If you had 5000 drachmas(aprox
13 euros), you couldn't spend it all in a day
I know exactly what you're talking about
It feels like melancholy, in some way
That one called Utopian Land, idk the artist, idc about the artist, idk who thought this was a good idea and I think it was the first time we didn't even pass the semi-finals and rightfully so
Tbh every entry after 2014 is just a waste of resources
edit: my opinion, of course
[Unironically best song we ever sent]
Since 2014, I've liked none of our songs
Cyprus on the other hand has send songs such Gravity, Alter Ego and Fuego in this time span
They should bring public vote back
Love it or hate it, Lasha Tumbai is iconic
No it was **the best** mate
Still remember it like it was yesterday, and I was a little kid
You know what, I never imagined I'd grow up to appreciate S.A.G.A.P.O. but here I am
yup I second that
In Greece we have a tradition called Οχι day (Όχι means no in Greek) which celebrates the time where we said no to the nazis and beat them when they wanted to take over
Funny thing is, we already call it that
Its practical
I mean, you don't hear people saying "The Hellenic Republic" or "The Kingdom of Denmark"
In Greece out name is Hellas , but the official name is Hellenic Republic
I think changing the name from Czech Republic go Czechia,  because it "sounds" better , doesnt make any sense
In against it
[this one's  very  bad ass]
And the one we use now
I liked [This one] fromthe 1700
[This one] I guess (yeah I know it's not a greek flag in the traditional term)
[Kingdom Of Greece Flag] used on 1832–1924 and 1935–1973
Its a treason then
Can't unsee it
Ζήλεια (zília) / Ζήλος (zílos)
Φθόνος (fthónos)
It's a bit more complex than that though
The word for jealousy describes a state where one wishes or actively tries to get the object of desire while the word for envy describes a state where one feels sad that he that he doesn't have the very same object
Basically the difference lies on a active/passive basis
This is why φθόνος is used more rarely and not just because its archaic
E.g. when you feel jealous of someone driving a nice car you are actively working in your life to maybe one day get it as well
Ζήλια comes from ancient greek Ζήλος which means Zeal
In fact, it's obvious that both words zeal and jealousy have their root origins from ζήλος.
&#x200B;
We still use φθόνος today when we mean to be more like grim about it
Just like the song goes too:
Ποια μοίρα με ζηλεύει
Ποιο μάτι φθονερό
Και χάθηκε μια αγάπη
Προτού να τη χαρώ
Those lyrics, see, make use of both of words
The form of κάμνει το που ζήλια doesn't exist in Greece
But that's not the active/passive distinction I try to make anyway
In regards now to the negative state you're referring to haven't you heard someone say I'm on vacation and the other person saying "Oh, I'm so jealous of you"? This is more like how I'd wish to be in your place and I'm happy that you are at it
I find this more useful to be honest in every day speech
It would be interesting though if a language had all four
In general though, ζήλια can be both negative and positive while φθόνος is always negative, but passively negative
Yeah I think it is a regional deference as well
Aragonese is a language just as Occitan or Catalan are
For Athens I would definitely say off the top of my head:
-Tourism industry, because of its rich history
-shipping (Port of Pireaus is like one of the largest in Europe)
After a Google search I found out that we also have
-a pretty big software development industry
-insurance industry
According to Wikipedia :
>Multinational companies such as Ericsson, Sony, Siemens, Motorola, Samsung, Microsoft, Novartis, Mondelez, Coca-Cola, etc
have their regional research and development headquarters also there
And also major Greek companies
But overall I hope Athens would be better for business etc
No not really, in the cities there is everyone but farmers (they are on the rest of regions near the big city)
Yes in Athens we tend to attract people who want to find a job
I would add Athens to history
It's the only thing our city is good at don't take it away from us
lol
Edit: okay I was exaggerating a little bit, we actually have a few things to brag or to be proud about our capital
They partially made it since they hold part of it
In Greece it's commonly referred to as the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine, but media usually shorten it as the Pfizer vaccine
I got my second dose a few days ago and on my vaccination certificate it says:
"Biontech Manufacturing GmbH, Germany"
Everyone knows "Biontech" created it, although everyone calls it by its distributor "Pfizer" simply because it's an easier and shorter name
ευχαριστώ (), thank you (), danke (), gracias (), tak (), takk (), merci (), grazie (), kiitos (), спасибо ()
I think that's all
English: Thank you
Greek: Ευχαριστώ (Efharisto)
Spanish: Gracias
French: Merci
German: Dankeschon
Russian (it's spoken in several parts of Europe): спасибо (spasiba)
Italian: Grazie
6 off the top of my head
No you aint wrong,its written " eucharisto "  but pronounced as  " efcharisto "
Same word , different spelling, Greek is weird :p
Quantum mechanics
They have good research going on
A country close to Indonesia and Malaysia
There's more to my country than ancient stuff and islands
Specifically German is known for its ability to take any words and construct a huge composite word, we can absolutely do the same in Greek, and do it pretty often (well ok, maybe not that often, but you can)
Its not all islands, we have mountains, and velouchi water, better than any other water ive seen
That's so dope
We can't do and haven't been doing it to that extent though
Indeed, any visual representation of my country is either of something ancient or of an island
Well we have the Acropolis
And Santorini too
But I'm basically talking about the modern arts and literature Greece has to offer
aaand it's done
Yeah I'm sure there are, I didn't say it's only German and Greek, it's just that I've never seen anyone mention that you can do that in other languages, and whenever I've seen a fact about being able to do it in German, they usually say it as if it's exclusive to that language
Well yeah true not sure why I said we do it *often", but wdym we can't? Μπορείς να πεις καρεκλοποδαροβρωμοκαλτσομαλακας (ότι μου ερχόταν στο μυαλό τώρα), αυτό δεν είναι που κάνουν και στα γερμανικά;
I'm loving this game we're playing
Duuuude
why stay there
There's so many landscapes that hardly look like your stereotypical Greek landscape
Especially in the mainland
Wow that's so amazing
Yes we sure can say that, but they have more words that they actually also use more often on their daily lifes, that are composite words
Μένω σε γερμανόφωνη χώρα και μου έχει κάνει εντύπωση αυτό
We would have an epic final together
I wanna see a swearing contest between an Italian, a Pole, a Serb and a Greek
You forgot Greece
In Greece there was "Κόμμα Ελλήνων Κυνηγών" = Party of Greek Hunters (Nature-Hunting-Fishing-Tradition) for the last 25 years . Mostly represented the rights of hunters and fishermen . At European Parliament Elections at 2014 took \~57000 votes (1%) ,  but didn't take part at any following elections .
Ok not exactly weird, but I find this funny af
We have our main Communist party ΚΚΕ (initials for "communist party of Greece"), but there are two more that are called:
ML KKE (Marxist Leninist KKE, same initials for KKE), and
KKE ML (KKE Marxist Leninist)
These are two very different and rather rival parties
Where do I sign up
Belgium
I categorize it as the smallest non small country
Indonesia, it's pretty freaking big, no one really thinks that just cause it's an island
The Czech Republic
In what exactly
Its not
Its the same memes repeating every month or so with some extra ones occasionally
Im starting to think some dude in his moms basement, experimenting on human behavior, is the one feeding this vicious circle
Same for /r/AmItheAsshole etc
I don't think cups and teaspoons/tablespoons are American measurements, we have them here too
The ingredients on the other hand
I mean marshmallow fluff
Oyster sauce
I'm lucky if I can find marshmallows to melt on my own
North Greece, we went to the Royal Macedonian tombs at Aiges, basically small hills that covered fancy burial places, got to see the bones, ceremonial armour and gold of Phillip II which was pretty dope
Love ancient history nowadays and I'd love to go back
I'm from Crete so the first trip that was memorable to me was in middle school when we took the overnight ship and went to Athens to do what every tourist does in Athens eg go to the Parthenon, the museum of acropolis etc needless to say we had a blast
Another memorable trip was in the last year of high school where we went a trip to Central Europe (Czech rep
, Germany, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria)
The internet, friend groups and the occasional bio teacher who also doesnt trust vaccines
Greece's second largest city, Thessaloniki, had such an important and numerous Jewish community that it was nicknamed [mother of Israel] with jews making up at least one third of the total population until the start of the 20th century
Then the nazi occupation happened
[Also apparently we came very close to having the same flag with Finland]
On 2 October, 1920 prince Alexandros of Greece was bit by a monkey while trying to break up a fight between her and his dog, Fritz
The bite was not taken care of properly and became infected
As a result he died two days later
This caused a series of events that eventually led to the defeat of Greece in the Asia Minor Expedition, and the deaths of millions of Anatolian Christians
I always find it strange that even though Russians never lost in Russia due to the harsh winter, they got decimated in Finland because of the fucking winter
In Greek we don't really ever use the pronouns _I, you, he/she/it, we, you, they_  since it can already be recognised by the word's ending
But from what I have seen, learners of the Greek language do actually use them
I don't know Latin, basically like in Spanish
i love them because they all have some meaning behind them and most of them have some Ancient origin, for example
my town's name is Artemis (from the goddess)
but originaly i am from Heraklion (from hercules)
Yeah, there are also cities all over the Mediterranean with Greek origin
For example:
Naples>Neápolis(new city)
Monaco>mónikos(one house/family)
Yeah and it's the 5th (technically 6th) largest city in Greece
The name definitely is Greek but I don't know what it means, I googled it and apparently the Greeks that colonized that place (from phocaea) had a habit of starting the names of cities with Massa but thats it
(Also to this day the Greek name for Marseilles is massalia)
Pella was always the capital of Macedonia even under Alexander the Great, today it's just a village with a lot of history
Yeah but I think Sparta can qualify as a city
Greece has plenty of material for this, hundreds of little islands in the middle of the sea count
Western Macedonia and Eastern Thrace to the north are quite sparsely populated so they are out of the average Greek's mind
But
running along the spine of Greece is the Pindus mountain range that's quite big and empty
On the southern side of it there's an area called 'Agrafa', literally translated to 'Unwritten' but more accurately 'Unregistered' or 'Uncharted'. It's an area completely surrounded by 2000m mountains, and the river of the area exits through impassable gorges
It's named so because during the 400-500 years of Turkish occupation of Greece, they never bothered or managed to conquer Agrafa and so the area wasn't included in the Sultan's tax register, and the people lived freely in the mountains
Nowdays the Agrafa mountains are very sparsely populated, my dad's been, there's only a few tiny villages high up with at most a single coffee shop or something and mountain tops
we have so many islands so it's not the sea
the mountains on the other side
Gavdos island
The southernmost place in Europe
As soon as you fly to Athens, you need another 45’ flight to one of the cities of Crete island (or 8h ferry), another ~2h drive to a small town south of Crete and another 4h ferry, which you can only catch 2-3 times a week if you are lucky and it’s not very windy
Huh, didn't know it had a name
Hadn't realised just how hilly Central Wales is until I cycled through it, was deadly
I think urbanization is a global phenomenon but it's also the case for Greece, where young people and in general people move from small cities to the urban centers like Athens or Thessaloniki
It has been the case for a while already
well that used to happen but now it's actually the other way around now
for the duration of the past century everyone was moving to the capital or the "co-capital" aka Thessaloniki to the point where i live near the capital and i've never met anyone who's grandparents were born and raised in the capital, all my grandparents were born in Crete and moved to Athens except my dads mom that was born in in Smyrna
now everyone is moving back to other slightly big towns like Patras, Chania, Heraklion and so on
It has been the case with Greece the last 30-40 years
Approx
half of the total greek population lives in Athens Metropolitan Area
Some years ago in a reality show, there was a guy who introduced himself as a rugby coach
The whole population was like "we have rugby in Greece
I would be very surprised if even 1% of my countryman knew how it's played
Me included
Not popular at all
I don't even know if we have a team but I can tell you that rugby is known as the american sorry excuse for a sport
You can buy milk which lasts a long time (like, more than half a year) and you don't have to put in the fridge unless you open it, then it has to be refrigerated
It's usually sold either condensed in an airtight tin or not condensed (i guess) which is sold in an airtight carton
I used to drink the tinned milk at my grandma's house when I was little and I'd sometimes put it in my coffee as a young adult
That being said, most people prefer "fresh" milk, which has to be kept in the fridge both in store and at home and will last anywhere from a week to a month depending on it's pasteurization
As for eggs, they are usually not in the fridge when in store but we refrigerate them at home if we don't intend on using them all within the next day or two
Eggs are not refrigerated untill we brought them home
Milk is refrigerated
it's perfectly normal here if there's a lot left to eat, but usually people aks for the main dishes only and not the sides
Fun fact, it's also pretty normal to ask for any leftover bones when eating meat to give them to your dog
We Greeks tend to order a lot when eating out (many appetizers in the middle for all to share, often along with main dishes for each individual)
In most of the cases, something will definitely be left uneaten
In taverns and traditional restaurants, it is pretty common to ask them to wrap up the leftovers so that you can take them home
I usually also take the little bottle of ouzo with me, if it has not been emptied
However, you wouldn't ask the same if you dined in a gourmet restaurant
Then again, rarely you would order more than you could eat at the time in such restaurants, as they are pricey (and their portions are not really big)
Not at all
In tavernas we always order too much ( I mean you would too with the great food that they serve)
Most people in Greece do that actually and most places will offer to pack your food so you can take it home
No, not at all, even in upscale restaurants
If a server sees your plate half full or more, they will probably ask you if you want to take the rest home
no some times they'll even ask you if you want a little box to take it home with, it's considered a "sin" to throw away food
My mom does this every time as well
She always finds either stray cats or dogs to feed them the leftovers
We have standard qwerty but next to the Latin letters there are Greek and you switch alphabets with shift+alt
[like this]
Oh the azerty keyboard fucked me up when I had put a password when creating my work email
I was at the IT guy's office, and I typed the password thinking im typing in qwerty
So, as you can imagine, the password i thought I wrote, was completely different than the one I actually typed
When we were setting up my desk, I requested a qwerty keyboard
So when I tried to access my account from my desk, I couldn't get in
So I thought maybe my account is not yet available
Thankfully I revisited the IT guy for something else that day, I noticed his keyboard and had an epiphany
Damn you azerty keyboard
Greece, I mean the Turks still call us Rum (Romans), how based is that
Byzantium is the name of an ancient Greek colony of the city state of Megara, named after their king, Byzantas, and the site Constantinople was build on
It was during the time that the seat of power of the Catholics was moved from the Vatican to France that the historians of the time were instructed to rename East Roman Empire to Byzantium for a number of reasons (Orthodox faith, being mostly Greek, outside of the Pope's influence etc)
Not all adopted the change though, countries like UK and Turkey still use the original name
I remember a law that was supposed to ban somoking inside bars, cafés ect (it was passed in 2010, I think)
That law had so many loopholes and was enforced (for lack of a better word) library, meaning that not only did it not ban smoking in closed public places as it was supposed to but it actually made it perfectly legal
The government literally shot itself in the foot and gave the middle finger to all us non-smokers
It would start with moro mou and end with moro mou, atleast that's what most everyone under 45 would say
I have to admit that I absolutely love all the Turkish affectionate words
More than the S/O related, I love the words used when family members express love to each other
For context I am pontic Greek, so my family and especially my grandmother often use words (or to be precise their pontic Greek equivalents which sound similar) like yavrum, çıkar, ciğer
There are no words that sound sweeter than those
I was wondering why I kept burning them when I tried to cook them
Thanks
The common accent from Athens is just considered normal
The accent of Macedonia is considered beautiful but also funny
The dialects of Thessaly are considered rude and uneducated
The Patras dialect is considered somehow aggressive, but nice
The dialect of Epirus is considered funny
The dialects of Rhodes, Cyprus and Lesbos are considered funny
The dialects of Crete are considered very masculine and it's very sexy for a man to speak it, but not for a woman
In Greece it's a bit different
The athenian accent is not really consider an accent, but the proper way to speak Greek
Obviously, people from other places might disagree with that, but it is somewhat true because it's a really unflavored way to speak; it doesn't skip letters, or highlight them excessively, etc
The cretan and the Thessaloniki accent are generally seen as positive
The ones from rural places have negative connotations
The Cyprus one is like speaking greek with an italian accent (at least to me)
It's polarizing, people love it or hate it
No posh accent, really
It's mostly the athenian one in the media, except from Cyprus of course, where they use their own
Well Greek accents usually brings the topic of place of origin
But foreign accents are treated as enthusiastic tourists trying to learn our language but if it's from the Balkans or Hindi and Pakistani they are treated as lower people for some reason
So, technically every accent except Instabulite is considered uneducated
Never even thought about it until now
I would say it's the same in Greece
We are very group oriented in general and people kind of pity you and thunk you have no friends to go out with
And keep staring until they get creeped out and leave
Then follow them
Sounds like free enterprise to me
But these things also happen in 'non-oppressive' regimes such as many democracies of the EU
Both from police and uniformed thugs and private thugs
Kokoretsi
It's lungs, liver and spleen wrapped with intestines and people go nuts about it
Me personally, I don't even enjoy the smell of it
Hey we have something similar too
I like it, as long as the meat is good and it's seasoned properly
Not everyone likes to be hit with liver flavour
My citizenship should be taken away because I fucking hate this stuff
Same with mageirítsa on easter, and don't even get me started on the smelliness of feta
Tavuk Gogsu is the shit
You can also find lamb souvlaki, its just not that common cause its more expensive
We have 18,here is a [list]
Call it selfishness, but I really overestimated how many sites Greece would have
16 of them are cultural
2 of them are both cultural and natural
The ongoing war among  North and  South Greece on how to call the bbq pork skewer
In Athens, it is called kalamaki (which also means plastic straw everywhere in Greece) and in Thessaloniki; souvlaki
By souvlaki Athenians mean gyros in greek pita bread with different toppings
In Thessaloniki for the same dish they say (pita) gyros
There's a nationwide debate on whether ground beef belongs in Gemista (peppers and tomatoes filled with rice [and ground beef])
I can't imagine myself eating them without ground beef
Well in North Greece and most islands people call [this] a Souvlaki and [this] a sandwich
While on central Greece (mainly Athens) we call the first one Kalamaki and the second one Souvlaki
(Kalamaki means small cane cause the sticks are made from cane and Souvlaki is a small souvla)
In Athens souvlaki is a general term, it applies to both kalamaki and pitogyro
There are also many battles in this war, for example sauce vs aloife and pitogyro vs sandwich
We have to unite our forces for the enemy is common; people who only eat patatopita
Eww why would you put meat
It ruins it
Keep ground beef out of gemista
It's confusing for the natives as well hahahaha
I'm from the North and whenever a friend from Athens or other places from the South tells me they ordered gyros I always double check what they mean
Never  knew it could be a name of an album
Edit: spelling
Noooo, I love patatopita with tzatziki or turokauteri
But **just** that
Forever
That'd be scary dude
Not forever, Panagitsa mou, but sometimes it's really nice
My enemies are those who order and exclude onions, tomatoes or mustard/ketchup
Hellas, because Greece was an insult centuries ago
Greek I believe comes from the word Graecus and ancient Greek tribe and it's patron
But it was used heavily in ottoman times
[Graecus- greek]
As for the political party and it's supporters they are on trial for organised crimes now and noone uses their symbols and agenta
To our actual name "Hellas"
Finally someone said it
Enough with the graikos think it's been 199 years since Independence , I think that's enough time to forget that awful name
Nahh Turkland sounds too basic
My head connects it with hibernation and then the fact that you're at the edge of Europe and nothing significant ever happens in Ireland
For some reason my dad still manages to mix up Sweden and Switzerland even though they sound completely different in Greek (Σουηδία & Ελβετία)
Beag in Irish, Bach in Welsh
Yup, and that area of North England and South Scotland used to be called "Yr hen ogledd" the old North" in medieval Welsh poetry etc because it lost the language later than the rest of what became England
That translates to "the Greeks". Would be E-li-nes
They might even think Cumbria is part of wales again who knows
I'm Greek it's Πορτογαλία/Portogalia, while France is Gallia, and the colour orange is πορτοκάλι/portocali
Little child me thought Portugal was the orange France
why
Dimitri is most common in Greece and Slavic nations
I'm a Greek with Slavic roots and it's also my name, lol
Are Alexei and Aleksandr different names
Not a variant of the same one
Of course we do, I personally try to avoid big logos since I'm not a walking advertisement and they are probably not appropriate for formal occasions but other than that
Depends on the logo, I can only speak for greece though
I personally try to avoid logos, but small logos that aren't too on the nose like a small ralph lauren logo in the corner of your shirt isn't a big deal, almost everyone wears shirts that might have a small non-intrusive logo
But unless you're a 14yo tiktoker hypebeast, people tend to avoid shirts with big/flex-y logos, but I thought that was the case evrywhere (?)
So basically, what I mean is that small non intrusive logos are very normal, but it sometimes can seem weird if you wear a shirt with huge branding with some small exception
Oversized english language lettering on t-shirts is a surefire way to identify eastern Europeans (Russians, Ukrainians etc)
Americans will have t-shirts with lettering but it will 'make sense' - like it will just be a free t-shirt from some organization etc
Speaking from many many summers of experience in playing "guess the tourist" in Greece
Turkey
It used to be one of the countries which i wanted to visit but since the 2016 coup i want to avoid that country in every cost
Even my family boycotts Turkish products now and they rarely boycott anything
Also Hungary & Poland
Both countries are getting worse and worse by each day with their regimes
And honourable mention my country Greece
I used to be proud for my country but since the Economic Crisis not so much
Switzerland
The animosity and coldness of the people is insufferable
Mate Athens is pretty much the worst possible example of a Greek city
It's just 4 million people packed together in grey apartments (although the metro system us quite clean and organized)
I believe that Thessaloniki and mostly northern Greece are in better conditions
Ah lol, most Greek redditors and really Athenians like me in general will agree with you
I would say projection is the same with just about every European capital, like I felt the same when I visited Berlin, although it sounds like I had a better impression of it than you had of Athens
OTOH have to admit when I visited Dresden I was pleasantly surprised, it felt a bit more like a "German city" if that makes sense (sorry to German folks if this perspective sounds stupid)
All these cities are advertised the same way by packing ads (whether they're videos or posters or w/e) with monuments or historic centers, but there's no city that is *just* that
IIRC this is a Thing with Paris specifically, the Japanese have a word for it or smth
Unfortunately Athens had the possibility to become a beautiful city, but there were decades of the construction sector trying to fill the city with apartment buildings to sell
All buildings are grey ugly boxes, newer ones often have short ceilings so they can fit more floors to sell
Affluent or older neighborhoods that are untouched are beautiful but the greater mass is ugly
Also not as many parks so too little green in a sea of grey
The problem is not that you consider it ugly (find one Greek person who thinks otherwise about the city), the problem is that you found this post-apocalyptic mess of a capital romantic to begin with lol
Athens is a grey concrete jungle
The things worth visiting in Athens are almost all of historic and archaelogical value
Reminds me of the way some people believe that Greece is full of little blue and white houses near the beach and it's always sunny and over 15°C lol
Thank you
I can't stress this enough, if you're planning on visiting Greece, focus on the north
Athens is just
ugly
Not that Thessaloniki is any prettier
My suggestions mostly consist of the smaller northern ~~cities~~ towns, like Kavala, Kastoria, Edessa, Drama
I'm in love with all four
Lots of people do, for some reason
It's mostly due to tourism marketing
It's important to contribute to the spread of tourism in Greece to places other than Mykonos, Santorini, Athens and Crete, imo
That utopian image of Sweden has gotten into the minds of pretty much everyone here in Greece
I mean, it's a beautiful country, but over-the-top romanticization isn't a healthy mindset
Our relationship has always been troubled but there were attempts to leave everything behind
The last years have been horrible though
The ever-present possibility of a much stronger country declaring war on yours, led by an authoritarian lunatic is really really bad
Especially because I am a male of fighting age
We don't really hate each other as much as non-Turks and non-Greeks like to imagine
The people of both countries get along with each other pretty well; it's the politics that's kinda heated
Well Greece hit a ROCK bottom in every single thing since the crisis
Especially in 2010-2015 we were the biggest laughing of Europe and also the most hated European country and then people started to get the impression that Greece is like Venezuela or Syria which is not true
Thanks to Brexit and Orban we are no longer the most embarrassing EU country anymore but Greece is still a hot mess and it's still doubtful if we will ever recover from the 2008 crisis
man, we only hang out in the suburbs because it's nice there
Me and basically everyone else I know who lives in the suburbs avoid hanging out in the centre of Athens at all costs because it's ugly af
Obviously, I am not speaking for everyone rn, but for the younger generations this is becoming more and more of a trend
Based on my perception, crime depends on the line
Red and Blue are ok; the green one is a nightmare in every way
Athens is still full of life and good food, don't get me wrong
However if you'd been to Thessaloniki first, then the sheer size and density of the capital will be a shock to you
I wouldn't say disappointed, there are still many attrcations and beautiful places there
Yeah agreed
As another comment said, Berlin felt
"un-German" somehow, it wasn't as clean and orderly as I expected - Dresden was that and much more beautiful too in contrast
I've been to the Acropolis in the past year more times than most people ever do and I got my fill of it in a sense, it's incredibly awe-inspiring to me but it's... oppressive relative to the marketing of Athens
This is in part why people especially on /r/greece always recommend if you visit Greece for a week, take a couple of days in Athens at most then spend the rest on an island or more generally *not in a city
Same in Thessaloniki
My whole circle is from the northeastern suburbs and we just love to hang out there and avoid the city centre at all costs, unless we wanna smoke some hookah or something, which is unreasonably expensive in the suburbs (lots of mainstream lounge/coffee shop owners in the suburbs really think they're someone important and keep raising their prices lol)
Hmm depends on the crime though, I think pickpocketing is pretty common in all lines; I'm not saying it to be negative, just cause awareness is the key to avoiding it
Like, in Munich I got so damn shocked about how people wore their backpacks on, uhm, their back on the metro
Here it'd feel like wanting to get something stolen, idk, I always bring my bag up front and mind the zippers
Btw, no worries, as most said, most Athenians feel the same way about the city, despite liking it or not
I think Greece is not really big on the "beautiful big cities" part tbh, villages / islands / smaller cities are much more worth imo
Hahaha yeah exactly the same here in Athens, although we do have some good places for hookah in the suburbs too, but some of them are just borderline scams tbf
Good kowalski analysis
Nah, i don't really care
Never really thought about that but since my language was once the lingua franca i have no reason to be salty lmao
Italy: They have better stuff to deal right now tbh
Albania: Sometimes
North Macedonia: In the past yes but now not really
Bulgaria: Nah
Turkey: Y E S
Cyprus: Does their really low quality soap operas count
(Greek soap operas are not much better either anyway)
Well Turkey violates our airspace and open refugees to our border so yeah
Mush beans
Yikes
I never felt in no way threatened by our Italian brothers
Not Albania,North Macedonia, or Bulgaria are nations that threaten us in no way
North Macedonia has an insignificant army with Soviet era equipment
Bulgaria and Albania more or less in the same situation
I don't think we should be fear either by Turkey
That tricked they pulled in Evros failed miserably
how could albania even do anything to us
Or he just doesn't have an interest in destabilising Bulgaria
I heard the Greek minority there is pretty oppressed
Plus if i remember correctly their prime minister said some negative things about Greece in the past but still not as much as in Turkey
I don't hate Albania anyway and definitely i didn't supported Katsifas and his likes
Oh yeah, i agree with you
I thought you were talking about invasions and stuff my bad
My grandmother could speak [Arvanitika] My mother understands a little, but me none
Personally, I've never met anyone in Greece under the age of 60 that can speak it
It's fairly mutually intelligible with standard Albanian though
Pontic Greek, which is a soon-to-be obsolete dialect of Greek, spoken primarily on the coasts of Black Sea (Pontus), in present-day Turkey
Most of the people speaking it today are descendants of Greek refugees that fled Turkey back in the 20's, living in Greece, Russia, Georgia
Well the Republic of Cyprus even has a [Turkish Cypriot MEP]
We really should stop blaming others (like the EU) for all our problems
It ain't 400 BC anymore
We are xenophobic, philoxenia is still just that, treating someone like a foreigner
Debt
To be fair, it's not like we aren't blaming ourselves
Ok so, first of all
Claiming that the **vast** majority of Greek people don't blame the way things are handled internally **first** and foremost is to say the least disingenuous
And you should know this unless you are not living in Greece
Second of all, to say that there is no blame to be put on outside factors (meaning the EU among others) is also just blatantly false
You can choose to use nuance when it comes to certain topics or you can choose to just blatantly pander like you are doing
Ελεος με το γλειψιμο πια και την καραμελα οτι οι Ελληνες ειναι οι κακοι της υποθεσης που κατηγορουν αδικα την αθωα ΕΕ που δε μας εκανε ποτε τιποτα. Σε αλλη χωρα ζεις ή ζεις τελειως στον κοσμο σου και δεν εχεις καταλαβει τι εχει γινει την τελευταια δεκαετια?
If it offers you any comfort, our man Xenophon wrote a whole ass book about your guy Cyrus, and also Aeschylus wrote a play titled "The Persians", unique among ancient Greek plays because it was based on real life people, rather than myths
You better bet no one ever wrote a play "The Ottomans".
>Claiming that the **vast** majority of Greek people don't blame
Never wrote such thing
Feel free to point where I wrote that
You are the one that did
Go on
>And you should know this unless you are not living in Greece
I am in fact living here, my whole life
What I actually get from this is "You're obviously not from here if you don't see things the way I do".
>Second of all, to say that there is no blame to be put on outside factors (meaning the EU among others) is also just blatantly false
Again, may you please point out where exactly I wrote that the EU is completely innocent and blameless
If that's your own interpretation of what I wrote, it is no fault of mine
In this case, stop projecting
What you think I meant is not necessarily what I actually meant
>You can choose to use nuance when it comes to certain topics or you can choose to just blatantly pander like you are doing
And you can choose to read what I actually wrote instead of getting mad at something you made up in your mind:  We really should stop blaming others (like the EU) for **all** our problems
That's it
If you think the others, like the EU for example, is to blame for every single thing, which was what I wrote, is just stupid
Emphasis on ***all***, and the EU is just an example of those blamed
I did not write "We are to blame for everything about the crisis, and the poor EU did nothing wrong", which is what your understood
What I wrote was "We have a tendency to blame others for our problems, and the EU is one of those 'others', among others". Just this
I was not even referring to the economic crisis exclusively
I did not even write that the EU is the only one that is ever blamed
I wrote it as an example
Basic reading skills
Thanks for proving my point
Wish I could say the same for us
Being kind to foreigners
Kindness yes, but still treating them as foreigners
Ασε μας ρε ξεφτιλα που μου απαντας και στα αγγλικα
Ευχαριστώ που απέδειξες το επιχείρημά μου.
Το ποιο? Εγραψες καποιο επιχειρημα? Γιατι εγω μονο την προσωπικη σου αποψη βλεπω.
They already have but man would a byzantine assassin be great
Well I'm lucky enough to have AC Odyssey so Im satisfied
They already made Revelations and Odyssey
I am more font of our Roman past than anything before 146 BC so I would like something during the Arab-Byzantine wars
The War of Independence would be interesting as well, naval battles, land battles, drama, the lot
That is if I cared about the series, I lost interest since '12
You bet
The first that comes to mind is choryátis/a (χωριάτης/α) witch literally means villager, countryman
The other is cáguras (κάγκουρας) referring to someone who behaves like a bum, has poor speaking skills, doesn't abide by the rules and usually owns a scooter/motorbike
In addition to that he still lives at his parents because he doesn't work
The other is clarinogambrós (κλαρινογαμπρός) literally meaning clarinet groom
He is the evolution of the cánguras
The difference between the two is that this version has more money and spends it all buying Moët in night clubs
He also pays a lot to get his hair and beard done so that he can get laid easier
Κάγκουρες (Kagures)
Malakes
Rock, disco and the usual Greek folk/entehno stuff
Generally the 70s, 80s & 90s are the most beloved decades in terms of Greek music here
Sometimes those 3 decades are also called as the Golden decades of Greek music scene by the Greeks
+1 for entehno
The Cypriots speak Greek and we still cannot understand what they are saying
Y'all have so similar languages my language is its own family
If you count Tsakonian as a different language from Greek, then I can say that I can't understand a single word of it
Greek Cypriots basically turn sentences into long, melodic-sounding words, so there's some trouble understanding them
My fluency in English and my little knowledge of German allowed me to **partially** understand the north Germanic languages (except for Icelandic) before I got to learn Danish
I still can't make any sense of Icelandic and Dutch, though
I believe I would understand around 70% of cypriot Greek perhaps more if they spoke slowly
And I can understand 90% of the cretan, pontus and other Greek dialects
Same goes for people from villages in crete
If you get exposed to the cypriot dialect then you'll understand them :)
I would say that people outside of Athens don't have a big problem understanding what they are  saying, especially in Rhodes where they speak a similar way
It's also the same for every place in Greece that is not Athens :p
Good ol' cup o' hemlock
It's summer, we are on vacation
We don't kill anyone
But if we did, it would be by a firing squad or hanging
The death penalty was officially abolished in Greece, in the 90's I think but the last person executed was in the early 70's.
Financial Crisis
i'd say most students and young people can hold a conversation because it's treated as mandatory for you future when growing up
i've only ever met 2 people over the age of 40 that know english, one was my english teacher and a Greek that grew up in Canada and came back
We don't do that at all
Not even in universities, which are supposed to accept and encourage foreign students
Bear in mind that the syllabus mentions that several courses (to the lecturer's discretion) may be offered in English
Best part, this professor in my uni had two students from Cameroon once and I'm the first class asked them: " are you more comfortable with English or French
" To which the students said French was more comfortable to them but they were happy with English
So the prof literally said "Bon" (which I think is good in French
) and proceeded to give the entire lecture in Greek
Yeah basically
I dont
think so
There are these pesky turks that like to pretend that they are a separate nation and that Constantinople is named *Istanbul* of all things,while they are sitting in their anchor, but they'll learn
Ι really wanna see a Kurdish country,i dont care if that will be in Turkey Iraq nor Syria
I think any culture group needs hes own nation
(no offense)
Gr8 b8 m8
I know but Kurdistan in particular is a really realistic idea, they are 30 million worldwide they need their own nation
You just made me realise I don't know the difference between a pigeon and a dove either
And they're both called peristéri in Greek
There is not much to identify with citywise, I only use this information when I want to speak about a specific thing that is relevant to my city
I identify more with the country
I don't like the word nation much because in Greece it has been used to promote racism against non Greeks (not the word's fault, but now the damage is done for me)
Nation way more
My family doesn't have a long history in my current area as they moved her after fleeing the Ottoman Empire's/Turkey's genocide of Christian populations
(Armenian and Hellenic genocides)
There is nothing to be proud of really
We still have some teasing rivalry amongst us but it's not too much of a deal
We were a neighborhood of 6-7 kids, in a dirt road with plenty trees around
We would climb trees and claim them as our own and naming them (the best will for ever be Black scorpion) and find random wood planks and stuff and build small houses
mostly playing football
a couple of video games (as an old head I hail from the amstrad, commodore 64 days) and TV
That sounds like you had an amazing childhood
Which part of Greece are you from
Haha we didn't have many other kids around but we would fight each other with anything we could throw
At first it was olives but we emptied all the olives in the area so we moved on to stones until I got one to the face and our parents forced us to stop
Eastern coast of Attica
"world" is literally unpronounceable
"Girl/girlfriend" and "literally" are also words I struggle with
•waltz
•rural
•world
•roar
From the top of my head, that is
If I actually sit down and take a good look at my english books, ohhhh boy
I think it has to do with how vowels in english are really soft, while in greek they are power itself
Some wrong pronunciations that I have heard over the years and find extremely funny are: choir (tsoh-eer), island (is+land, which makes no sense bc it's not land), cigarette (ts-igarette) and picture (peek-tu-reh)
Keep in mind that these were said by people who know ther English and either had passed or were about to give English exams for the C2 (proficiency) certificate
for me it is the shit - sheet , beach - bitch and all the similar ones
For the love of me  and even though my mom grew up in Australia so I was raised listening to English , I cannot pronounce them correctly
Also, greek words in English
Like unconsciously I am pronouncing them the greek way
And lastly the thick sh sound like in English, I had to consciously remember to pronounce the "heavy " sh until it became a habit
Surprised no one mentioned the word “ubiquitous”. Should just be me
Literally all these words are Greek
Even parenthesis that the guys are talking about in that other comment
Γ'ρλντ :D
Greeks like our vowels hard and distinct, not whatever that quarter-beat tiple cross between an -e, an -o and an -u is at the start of that word
Fun fact: There's no way to differenciate between "nt" and "d" or "mp" and "b" in greek writing and I think greeks generally have a terrible ear for discriminating between certain consonant sounds
For example, surely no native greek speaker considers the world "train" to be unpronouncable, but we'll pronounce it almost like "drain" 100% of the time, because the starting 't' just doesn't quite map on greek 'tau', and thinking of single consonants as a spectrum of sounds just feels weird
I came here to say "world".
Meanwhile I struggle in not pronouncing the "h"s in spanish
So basically "ruuul"
Yep that word can generally point you at the nationality of the person saying it lol
That's clever but it's biologically impossible for me to not pronounce every letter lol
As a Greek this is totally easy for me to say
I would believe same goes for Spaniards
It’s the transfer, I don’t even know how to pronounce them correctly in English
But any way I say it, I have the best excuse “it’s Greek and that’s how we pronounce it ”
The shrug is mandatory
Scotland, similar kilt like outfits, both of our national animals are mythical beings (Greece has two national animals, the Dolphin and the Phoenix), one of our ethnic instruments is bagpipe related (tsampouna is popular with island folk), both country flags are white and blue with very similar shades
I haven't been to Mexico but the impression I'm getting from popular culture seems that it seems like Greece
Most if not all the Mediterranean and Balkan countries
Italians, the Spanish and the Portuguese just have this familiar aura about them that makes me feel like I'm meeting someone from my country
And well, we share a religion with most of the Balkans and from what I've seen many traditions and customs as well
Hell, even our houses, our neighborhoods and our entire towns look similar
Edit; And Ireland as well
They're the only northerners I can personally relate to
I guess our personalities kinda match
I don't know how to describe it, but we get along pretty well
I remember having an Irish classmate in primary school and he knew more about Greece than I did
It honestly surprised me, but in the good way
Japan
The have many words that sound modern Greek(like the aki ending)
And also some of their meat dishes I have tried remind me of European cuisine
The Balkans and Russia
Beautiful landscape
Beautiful beaches
Rich History
Great Food
And when we're drunk we act the same
We also have random sand dunes on an island
Excluding Meteora, I guess probably that
Here in Greece, for public education at least
The ministry of education has made it standard to use Cisco webex for web conferencing and a custom made platform for asynchronous  tasks, such as assignments(which works 100% of the time, only some of the time)
In the International Hellenic University in Greece we're only using Zoom
In my university we have a plethora of different apps and platforms that we use
It's basically up to whoever is doing the course to pick a platform
* Courses with a large audience are being done on the University's streaming platform
The lectures are livestreamed and later uploaded on the same site for people who couldn't watch them live
They are being recorded from my department's auditoriums with professional cameras and all
The problem is that students cannot interact with the professors in real time, so some professors host a q&a session once a week on Skype or Zoom
As for the rest, you can send them an email and pray they reply (Greek university professors are notorious for avoiding questions from students)
* The courses with a smaller audience (10-25 students) are done via Skype for Business/Zoom/Webex
* Unfortunately, a couple of professors don't even bother with any of it
They just upload their slides and/or notes on eclass and that's it
Zoom for afternoon classes
Regular school has started up again, though not like before
In University of Athens we use WebEx and Skype Business
I can only think of:
\- Καμένα Βούρλα(kamena vurla) = Burned bulrushes , but bulrush is metaphorically (and most commonly) used as 'stupid', so overall it translates like 'burned stupid people'
\- Της γριάς το πήδημα (tis yrias to pithima) = The old lady's fuck ... or 'the old lady's jump'; pithima means both
\- Πάπαρι (papari)=doesn't mean anything, but put the emphasis on the 2nd syllable and, voilà, 'a bollock'
Compared to all others tho, damn
can't think of any, all are cool ancient names
We have the island of Lesbos
We have a place called Malakasa
Probably the Mati fires from 2018
People had built illegal fences for their homes which made getting to the beach like a maze and the people in the fires couldn't get out in time
Some old man started the fire by burning weeds in his garden
Also the fire department was confused as to what was going on because the entire town was burned down in 1 hour
As far as sea accidents go, there was the [Falkonera Shipwreck] in the 60's. From a total of 200 passengers and crew only 50 survived (some accounts mention the fatalities as high as 270, due to no passengers list back then and the ability, to issue tickets on board),. A lorry was parked towards the ship's door, without any safety measures
They just put some stops in front of its back wheels
Due to really bad weather and big waves, the lorry fell on the ships door and it opened
The deadliest, was back in 1947, the Chimaira shipwreck
320 dead people
As far as auto accidents go, the worst, involved a [bus full of teenagers] returning to their homes from a 3 days school trip and a lorry that was illegally carrying [novopan] Many factors where involved, all of them due to human errors and greed
Firstly, the accident happend in [Vale of Tempe] which had (back then) one of the worst national roads that Greece had
Imagine, two lanes without anything to seperate them and full of blind turns, due to the physiology of the landscape
Secondly, the lorry was overloaded, with bad wheels and a driver that hasn't rest for days
He tried to take a turn, the bus was coming and the novopan went [flying over to the bus] Out of the 47 students (Ages 16-17) the 21 died, horribly
Then there was the [Karaiskakis Stadium Disaster]
Wildfires near Athens in 2018 that cause the death of 102 people
The area had no urban plan of construction so when the need to evacuate arrised, roads where blocked and people where trapped inside house fences when trying to reach the sea (yes, they where extremly close to the beach) because the smoke limited visibility and mobility
Even thought the whole country saw the consequences of  arbitrarily building inside a forrest arrea, reconstruction plans are being made
My country is already religious but yeah this happens even with the irreligious ones
saying some common expression of ones language doesn't make him/her religious, there are many words and expressions that have roots in the various religions of the world that doesn't mean they are used religiously, it's empty words like thoughts and prayers etc
My first hand experience: My family is orthodox but not particularly observant or faithful
That said, whenever someone died we (and when I say 'we' I mean my mother, the rest of us just followed) suddenly turned into Eleni Louka: we went to church more than twice a week, prayed and fasted, before finally going back to our normal, religiously indifferent lives a couple months later
In my experience, atheists who hold the the last position you outline
>In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities
... are very rare
The terms themselves (absence or rejection of belief in a deity vs ignorance on the existence of deities) fundamentally have no contradiction between themselves, you can absolutely hold both
Unless you talk to hardline theists/atheists, I would guess the majority of people can be led down a line of argument that ends at their acknowledgement that they do not or cannot know if (a) god exists
This acknowledgement is in no way incompatible with faith or lack/rejection thereof
Was going to say exactly this
"Agnostic atheism" is in fact the default position most atheists have, as in, they do not believe or want to (are irreligious) but also abstain from making claims on whether god exists; this is something only "militant atheists" sometimes do, but it's rarely dressed in absolute sounding language
*Nobody* is 100% certain
Therefore agnosticism is a "default" position of sorts
It is in no way incompatible with being atheist, however, the contrary in fact
I categorically disagree
You're essentially equating disbelief/lack of belief to believing, as in, you're saying there's a leap of faith involved for atheists to reject belief in a god, which in my opinion is a misunderstanding of the term
I have, ever since I acquired the vocabulary for this subject, defined myself as [agnostic atheist] The fact of the matter is that not even the most ardent believers *know* if there's "something out there", they simply have faith one way or another
In awareness of my ignorance, I simply refused to involve myself with organized religion so long as social life allows and have almost no spiritual baggage as a result
"Malaka" as is tradition
Older people probably say that they have been there on holidays and they had a great time
"I've always wanted to go to Greece for vacation"
I don't really mind but sometimes they go
"Pay debts" Like damn bro it's 2020 it's been a while since the crisis and every country is in debt
When I tell them I'm from Greece their reaction is mostly "oh really
", sometimes followed by "you don't look like greek".
Used to be interested, now they will probably look at you like a monster
I'd say people from the Balkans would get along as we share so many common cultural things
But most of the times there is a national conflict between most countries which i guess makes people less comfortable
As to greece and serbia, it probably has to do with the fact that we share the same religion (orthodox christianity)
Μηπως μας κανανε και στους 2 λαους πειραματα με lsd τη δεκαετια του 50;
Χαχαχαχα, i see you are a man of culture
They were more popular in the past but they never had a huge impact here except maybe in the late 00s-early 10s where machines who make ozonated water, window nets & heaters were pretty popular
One of my relatives had the machine who makes ozonated water, i remember the taste wasn't much different from the tap water
OMG i also remember this commercial
It was broadcasted in the Greek TV too
Chef Tony is such a legend
Probably [this] photo of the Nazi flag being erected on the Acropolis during the German occupation of Greece
A few days later, the flag was torn down by two resistance fighters, Apostolos Santas and Manolis Glezos
Despite being the most inspiring act of resistance during the occupation, the two men were persecuted after the liberation by the anti-communist post-war government (which was largely made up of Nazi collaborators - thanks UK and US) and were sent into exile
Santas died in 2011, but Glezos is still alive and even served as an MP and MEP a few times
low effort post
an(y)  aerial photography  of the  Acropolis/ Parthenon
I spent way too much time reading about the Munich Massacre, inspired by your post
Thanks
In my opinion Italian is absolutely beautiful
I also like Spanish but Italian is just more
song-like
Not sure if that made any sense but you (hopefully) get my point
I'm one of the few people in Greece that like the sound of German i think
Hahah
The opposite is true as well
I find it really easy and enjoyable to mimic the Spanish accent
in our modern history after we freed ourselves, all of our monarchs were foreign, because it was outrageous back then to be a democracy so we had a german noble installed and that continued until our last one
All of the modern Greek royalty have been of Bavarian or Danish heritage
If the "Great Powers" of the time had been more agreeable, they would probably have been Belgian, because after governor Kapodistrias was assassinated, the first choice was Leopold of Belgium but his demands weren't met
In recent times we had George Papandreou (born in Minessotta, US)
Bavarian (Otto etc) and Danish (George, Constantine etc)
yeah otto was thrown out but i didn't remember if the next ones were danish, german or austrian
yeah so they could control us have us as puppet states, not because they were sad about our nations
Oh, I thought OP meant like "foreigner-foreigner".
Anyway, that explains the constant spoonerisms
Although, considering he was in the same party with Simitis, I wonder who was the master and who was the disciple
lol
Oh, my bad
He was born abroad, his mother was American, and he lived completely abroad until he was 22 years old
OK he is greek in the sense greek-americans are greek, but he is not like 'technically foreign born'. He grew up abroad until he was an adult
English teacher thought "together" is pronounced and written "torgether".
We had a cool young teacher in a vocational high school, he was I think a nurse or something in the medical field anyway, and he asked us to write anonymously anything we liked
A few days later one of the few answers he read aloud was mine
I had wrote something funny about my classmates being lobotomized etc
A kid then stops him and asks "What's a lobotomy
" and he answers "I have no idea at all, I don't think it's a real word
I don't understand what this whole thing means"...
I never took seriously anything he ever said or taught after that
Did a Bulgarian write your history book
The modern greek word Historia( ιστορία) has root from the ancient greek word histor(ιστωρ) which means the one who knows a lot on a certain  subject, who is an expert
Ok, I'll do my part for Greece even tho I am not the best person for it as I am not religious
Holiday description according to Wikipedia:
The 6th of January in Greece is called Θεοφάνεια (= divine revelation)
Also goes by names like Επιφάνια (= epiphany) or Γιορτή των Φώτων (= holiday of the Lights)
It celebrates the day Jesus was baptised and basically the revelation of the holy Trinity
So, us Greeks, honor this day by throwing a cross in the sea/lake/river and believers race to retrieve it
In our version of orthodoxy, it's called theophania, and it symbolizes the baptism of Christ
There's carols specific to the day, there's a ceremony where the priest blesses the waters during which he throws a cross inside the sea, lake or wherever the ceremony takes place, and swimmers rush to find it, with the person finding it having good luck or something like that
At some point they also release pigeons symbolizing the holy spirit
Customarily, many take a bottle of holy water with them that day (the priest blesses a container of drinkable water for the faithful to take home)
"Σα βγεις στον πηγαιμό για την Ιθάκη,
Να 'υχεσαι να 'ναι μακρύς ο δρόμος" probably,
by Kavafis, from the poem Ithaca
Roughly translated to
"When you get on your way to Ithaca (Odysseus's homeland),
wish for the road to be long"
I would say yes, we tend to be portrayed in a friendly, hospitable and proud way
Every film about the life of Jesus is (at least supposedly) set there
Also many films about the Old Testament and other ancient events and empires
You understand that there are many stereotypes in such films
Don't do [this]
If you wanna wave at someone, just keep your fingers close
Definitely not a luxury brand . Nowadays an affordable to a little pricey, depending on some items, brand
The food market is great though , the restaurant also good .
Unreliable Nordic furnitures that requires you to build them yourself
With long ass names that are unpronounceable too
IKEA in Greece, is considered expensive, stylish and  not very sturdy as furnitures
Greeks tend to buy pieces of furniture  here and there but I don't know anyone that has furnished his whole house from IKEA
I'm not sure how it's viewed in the whole country but I live 5minutes away from the one in the Athens airport so we've always been getting our furniture from there and always are aware of any sales going on in it
Known as that place that serves horse meatballs without your knowledge
( dont know if it's real or just an urban myth)
It's definitely not seen as a luxury furniture store, quite the opposite I might say
We kinda see it as a student  furniture store, although I find it ridiculously expensive compared to quality and the fact that you have to assemble everything on your own
Their food is extremely cheap though, and also very tasty
The furnitures wouldn't last more than 2 weeks
Greek feta has entered the chat
Myzithra
Ladotyri
Manouri
Kalathaki
Formaela
Metsovone
Katiki
Sfela
Just the ones out the top of my head that are amazing and pretty much nobody outside greece knows
Most USian 'Italian' restaurants are actually Greek
Myzithra dry is good for pasta, and the 'fresh' version is really tasty as a salad cheese
Yeah definitely I think cheese and cured meats is where every European country has something amazing to offer
I can't think of a country that won't have some good cheese and salami like thing to go with their bread
The worse the local cuisine, the more international restaurants you get
Britain > Netherlands > Germany > Austria > Italy etc
I lived in the Netherlands for 2 years
I liked kaasuffle and frikandels
But I'm hard pressed to name any other good dutch food
Like a sausage and some root veggies
Maybe you like British food because they're in the same family
It isn't though, is it
I think that especially Greece is suffering from over-tourism that has created many restaurants that serve sub-par food (and only tourists go there)
For example, I love Moussaka but NEVER order it at restaurants (unless I know the restaurant in my neighborhood is good) because there are 2 things that go wrong: 1) the mince meat in moussaka is so 'hidden' under layers of other things that they can use all the leftover meat from other things (bolognese sauce for pasta, leftover cooked beef etc) and 2) eggplants take A LOT of oil to cook, and it is not affordable to use good olive oil in restaurants
So you get an eggplant that has been fried on cheap shitty oil
Moussaka is an amazing dish if made at home or at select places, but the fact that it is the staple of tourist traps is mind boggling for me
If you go to Greece I suggest trying the various 'mezes' that are like tapas plates and have really interesting flavors
Also coal grilled meat and fish of course
Don't judge Greek cuisine by what you may have experienced in the Netherlands, the restaurants abroad are really a different thing (outdated and touristy) than what you will experience in Athens for example
Lol ok
I see all the people flocking to the UK for the food
And all the English restaurants around the world
People come to the UK for many reasons, I have never heard a single person saying "I'll fly to manchester from France/Italy/Greece to get some good food". I've heard the opposite plenty
There's more Greek restaurants in the UK than British restaurants (what
) in the whole world
Sure you can pay big money to get some michelin stars or whatever, but the local cuisine, what people cook is deep fried crap and microwaved TV dinners
You have the famous chefs that put peas in carbonara like gordon ramsay
Give me a break lol
There are more Greek Restaurants in the UK alone, than British Restaurants in the rest of the world
Because even though you conquered half the world nobody wants to eat your food
The restaurants around the world that offer British dishes mostly do so to appeal to British tourists that can't venture to eat anything that is not deep fried
The Ottoman Empire
North Macedonia
Germany's, From Barbarians to conqueror's, to the Holy Roman empire, the thirty years war, Prussia, and then the unification of Germany, the World wars, the Berlin wall, I'm just fascinated With Germany and all of history in General
I also love Austria's history
The history of Italy really fascinates me, and they way it blends in with the history of Greece
I also find the history of Denmark quite interesting
Well Sweden mainly wrecked the imperial Army in the thirty years war
(Greece) Oh man so many times to pick from
I will take the question as 'my country' including the region historically (since modern Greece is only like 200 years old)
I think I would travel to Athens during the Hellenistic era (after Alexander the Great and before the Romans) and I would spend one week touring all the different philosophical schools
Epicureans, Stoics, Pythagoreans, Neoplatonists etc
I would take in all the amazing technology they had invented and the pinnacle of ancient civilization before the roman conquest and christian dark ages
It would be awesome
In general, I'd love to visit either Ancient Greece, or Thessaloniki during the Byzantine Empire
But I'd probably end up picking the winter of '41, just so my bitchass remembers that next time I'm about to complain about a small dumb thing
i can't think of a good time where i wouldn't die
i guess i'd like to meet my grandpa young but i can either meet him before he becomes 17 or late 20s without getting in ww2
I know the Cypriot national anthem because it's the same as the Greek one
I can understand on the spot the French and Russian anthem and with a bit of try the Polish one
Very little
I know only my country's anthem and few others
Generally I'm not fan of national anthems to the point that when i watch a video who features a national anthem i skip that part
I'm pretty sure is "Λαμψη" (Shine)
it was a soap opera running for over a decade
so a couple of thousand episodes I guess
After reading other comments our longest running TV show seems tiny
It's called Lampsi (=the Shine) and it aired for about 15 years (~3
500 episodes total)
My aunt used to watch it and I recall watching a few episodes with her and wanting to cry of boredom
Every second dialogue of the show went like this: -I have a lover
-Virna, are you trying to say that you have a lover
-Yes, Yiago, I wanted to tell you that I have a lover
-So, you mean that you have a lover
-Yiago, I can hide it no longer, I have a lover
-How dare you have a lover, Virna
and so on
You get the idea
Damn, you might wanna take a look at [this
According to this list, "Η Λάμψη" (The Shine) has been the longest running Greek TV series
It was aired everyday in Greece for more than 14 years (1991-2005) and has had 3'457 episodes
It was also dubbed into Bulgarian and aired in Bulgaria between 2000 and 2010
Not really "in my country", but Cypriots have really hard accents to understand when  they talk to other Cypriots (they change them when talking to us though, nice lads)
Cyprus speaks Greek, or at least that's what they claim
I have no idea what they say most of the time though
&#x200B;
EDIT: I'm not being mean by the way, I hope it doesn't come out that way
Islandic Greek evolved independently on each island
Cypriot Greek has a big influence from Ancient Greek and English
When I lived in London I met many people who were SHOCKED it snows in Greece
They assumed it's all beach and hot weather without realizing the country is mostly mountainous
I live near Athens, so we get either sleet, rain or snow that doesn't get blanketed (if that is the term)
Every few years, we get the real stuff, and it usually is newsworthy because everything slows down due to the chains required and the fear of ice, even with salt and wood chips on the tarmac
I wasn't expecting to get so worried by this thread
It depends on what part of the country you're talking about
In the south, like Crete, it basically just doesn't snow, ever
In Athens it snows once every few years
In the North, like Thessaloniki, you better prepare for a long and cold winter every year
I don't think I remember even a single year where it hasn't snowed in the North
Athens
Super Rarely
In Thessaloniki and nearby regions it is almost guaranteed to snow
Here in Northern Greece it snows maybe 3 or 4 times a year (like 2cm of snow that melts in a day)
However, I know for a fact that in many regions here, especially mountainous, it snows a lot
Climate change probably
My ex was from Fyn and I've noticed that Fyn's climate is strangely similar to that of my hometown in northern Greece
Nose rings are mostly seen as ok even in some professional settings
The rest of them could be considered rather informal in the workplace, and you would be discouraged from wearing them
In a casual setting though it's no big deal, except for the occasional grandma who will suddenly be reminded of her cow that had several rings and bells and chains to not get lost
They're ignored for the most part
The people that are 50 and down, and most educated people aged 70-90, will not view someone that is atheist as something bad nor they will criticize him
On the other hand some extremely religious people 30% of the population will tell you that god exists and other stuff
They maybe even fight
Although the majority of the population follows the Orthodox church, I think younger people (younger than 30-35 ) are mostly atheist/agnostics
Thus, I don't think being an Atheist causes any problems to most of them
Our previous PM ( A.Tsipras ) was an atheist, and that didn't seem to really influence the public vote in 2015
His [facial expressions]
I think the pictures speak on their own
That he looks like Mr Bean(Spoiler he does)
His name is correlated with bad luck so none says his name
And that he is the Greek Mr Bean
We elected him and now he runs it
And that he is unlucky,(i.e. when he was elected prime minister in July: Some time later (a week or so) there was the biggest or 2nd biggest earthquake in Greek history)
Mainly, his [terrible command of the English language
We ate the donkey, we are left with the queue
In Greek there's no "sh" sound, we say Βουδαπέστη (Voudapésti) with an "s" sound and the "d" pronounced as a "th" like in the word "the"
we call it Βουδαπέστη (Voudapesti) with a normal S sound
Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic
All three extremely different, from different parts of the world, that are spoken widely and open the most doors, or maybe Albanian cause my friend is from there idk
Danish, because I'm in love with it and the pronunciation is unforgiving
Spanish, because I'm in love with it and the grammar is unforgiving
And for a third option I'll choose German
Italian, French and Swedish
I already know some Italian, but I am by no means fluent in it
I would also really like to learn Spanish but the other 3 I listed are my top priorities in terms of how much I want to learn them
I probably am going to learn them all someday though, when I find the time
Ancient Greek, Latin and French
Because history is fun and also with those 3 I can learn any other language easily
Welsh is my flex third choice too, after English and Greek haha
When you say Indian so you mean Hindi
Cause there's thousands of languages in India
They are grammatically and syntactically compatible, being fluent at one will give you a limited understanding of the other but they are definatly not the same
I do, I mean Welsh is my actual flex language, I do speak out
If I could choose the three to learn itd be Spanish Arabic Mandarin
All police officers carry a handgun but the general rule is that they won't fire back unless they are fired upon with another firearm
Seeing heavily armed police officers is extremely rare, as in something really bad must have happened for them to get out
(I do not count Riot police in this because they again are not armed with firearms)
In Greece, most National police officers are armed
However municipal police is unarmed
And tbh, I don't find the usefulness of an unarmed police
What will they do
Call the cops
Greek police is always armed,with hand guns
But we have  different task forces, that are gradually more armed than the other
It's not common to see the more heavily armed walking on the streets
It has to be something really serious to be called
Europe, Asia, Africa, N and S America, Oceania, Antarctica
Yep
Same in Greece
We were taught about one America at my school, I thought that was the standard in Greece
Well I might be rembering it wrongly
In Athens they tried to build a infrastructure to cycle the whole city
People hated the idea and thought it was stupid because of the traffic
2 million euros were lost and the project got canceled about a month ago
In Thessaloniki (second biggest city and my hometown) it is more or less the same
Almost nothing
This year (I guess because of covid) they built a couple of lanes but no one use them since it's impossible to magically appear there with a bike out of nowhere
Roads are too dangerous to even get there
It's just a couple of lanes
I hope it will get improved but I doubt
Greek people love their cars and sadly most of us, think that bikes are for kids
We got what we deserve I guess
So, I've always had this question about countries where cycling to work is the norm
After 8km, I would assume you are somewhat sweaty and you wouldn't be wearing your work clothes while cycling either way
Do your offices/schools and such have showers and changing rooms where you change
Or what
Usually we grill and prepare a shit ton of food or more rarely order a shit ton of food, people arrive in advance before the food is ready to chat for a couple of hours
There will by music and loud conversations
We eat and then we have coffee and desert in which there will also be loud and long  conversations about a wide variety of topics
The reasons for the family gathering can be birthdays, a new baby, name days, or any happy new thing that happened
We average 12-18 people in big gatherings and we prepare food for 24 but generally I grew up having l my aunts family living in the same block of flat so 9/10 times we would eat together in the weekends
I am currently studying in another city alone and I do miss the noise of 2 families gathering to eat each weekend
(and ofcourse the food)
It starts like a regular thanksgiving type table and then after the parents have drunk some Raki they blast songs, break plates and dance all together on the broken plates
Even though this is the proper way theoretically, I've never seen such consistency before
I think nobody would actually use it that way, oder
A plausible answer
I'll skip the ancients, and instead mention some modern historical figures:
\- The "Heroes of 1821", AKA of the Greek War of Independence (Theodoros Kolokotronis, Georgios Karaiskakis, Manto Mavrogenous, Laskarina Bouboulina, Athanasios Diakos, Nikitaras, Alexandros Ypsilantis, the list goes on and on
Special mention to three of the founders of the Filiki Etaireia, whose names we -or at least I- memorized thanks to a short quote, "A blonde jackal wearing a cap", Xanthos, Tsakalov, Skoufas)
\- Ioannis Kapodistrias (first head of a newly independent Greece)
\- Eleftherios Venizelos (arguably the most important politician of Modern Greece, early 20th century)
\- Ioannis Metaxas (dictator 1936-1941
Among the reasons he's so widely known is the fact that he refused to allow the passage of the Italian army through Greece in 1940, an occasion that is celebrated as a national holiday -28th of October, the "Ochi/No Day")
\- Aris Velouchiotis (leading figure of the Greek resistance during the occupation of Greece in WW2)
\- Georgios Papadopoulos (leader of the Junta Regime, 1967-1974)
\- Andreas Papandreou (another important politician, mid- to late 20th century)
From the Byzantines I'd say Constantine the Great, the pair Justinian-Theodora, Basil II and Constantine XI are the most famous
As far as culture is concerned, there are certain people that almost everyone could name, whether they've come in contact with their work or not (El Greco, Solomos, Cavafy, Elytis, Seferis, Merkouri)
&#x200B;
*Edit: Grammar and wrong name*
Alexander the Great
Leonidas
Sokrates
Pericles
Aristotle
Pythagoras
Archemides
Theodoros Kolokotronis
Georgios Karaiskakis
Eleftherios Venizelos
I think you all know the Ancient Ones, the last 3 are very important figures in modern Greek, aka post Ottoman Greek history
Oh yeah, totally missed him
Allies in the First Balkan War then switching to enemies in the Second
Just Balkan stuff
Jokes aside, Greece and Bulgaria are the best regional example on how two nations that were bickering with each other for a very long time can put an end to this shit
There is no animosity post WW2 and no hot topics between Bulgaria and Greece anymore
In Greece I haven't heard of balcony related deaths or injuries
The last few years I also hear about these news elsewhere in the south yet I have no idea why
I hope it doesn't become a trend cause we have balconies too
They do all the other stuff you know too
Really drunk, sex acts and stuff
They're usually young so it's so stupid from their part to do this
Yes
Nope, fortunately they don't do that here
Although we have Many balconies
They are usually drunk and they tend to be in a lot of fights
And I mean a Lot
Usually with other Brits, which is peculiar, at least to me
is that really a thing
this sounds hilarious
I'd say that I don't particularly like the way it sounds and how non-discriptive it can sometimes be, but I like that it's super easy to use and it flows well
I love Greek more in every way tbf, I also know how to speak a bit of Italian and I love it too, also I'm currently learning French, and while I love it, it is making me want to die with some of its phrases (like why are there so many combinations with que, ce and est), but in general, I think the reason that I like Greek, Italian and French more than English is because I have gotten so used to the language (as 90% of the media I watch is in English and I'm exposed to the language for the majority of the day) that I have pretty much gotten bored of it
I'd honestly go as far as to say that I'm exposed to more English than Greek, and I live in Greece lmao (I guess it also depends on if I go out or speak on discord or wherever with friends on a certain day)
Also in "Australia" each a is pronounced differently
Oh great because the second one gives me headaches, I am kinda relieved now
You're lucky to be native french, it's a beautiful language and I wish I didn't have to painstakingly slowly learn it and could **just** know it hahaha
I, for myself, feel safe because I'm in good physical condition, young and there aren't any reported cases in my area
I wouldn't want to go however, because I come in contact, or live with people who are at a higher risk to suffer from the symptoms of covid
hookers, gypsies and mafia
Even northwestern and midwestern Greeks do that, mostly on the mountains
So covid-19 just suits you fine
The Acropolis (the parthenon mostly)
I'm from Thessaloniki, Greece
There are plenty
A walk through the Aristotle's Squere uo until the ancient Roman Agora
From there to the Church of St
Demetrious, the "protector" of the city
along with the catacombs beneath it
The Arch and the Palace of Galerious, and from there to the sea in the White Tower
If you go up you will the Rotunda , that during the Ottoman times it was converted to a mosque and has a beautiful minaret
That's also where the ancient byzantine walls start and go up north
There you will see most if not all of the wall as it was at those times
You can see the Hagia Sophia church , from the 8th century
Recent excavations for the development of the tube brought to light parts of the ancient Via Egnatia, houses and markets
And you have to think that if you dug even deeper you will find Ancient Greek/Macedonian structures
For many Turks that come here they can also see the house where Ataturk was born and raised, serving as the Turkish Consulate in Thessaloniki
We also have dozens of old mosques
And all of these are just in the part of the Centre of the city

I'm glad
Greek is σφυρί (sfyri) from ancient Greek σφῦρα.
The word comes from ασπαίρω (aspero) which means to shake with force or tremple or struggle especially like while dying
In Greek it is σφυρί (sfyrí) which isn't badass to me at least, but yeah
Σφυρί (Sfirí) Nope
Greece doesn't have the most badass word for 'hammer'
>, which sounds like a sexual innuendo
γεια σου βρε αντρα φυσφιρή πού χεις μια πούτσα σαν σφυρί
που'σαι ρε αντρα φυσφιρή που την εχεις σαν σφυρι
oh mean other people's doesn't look like a sfiri ?
I live in Greece
Here most 25 year olds make about 600€ per month
Out of that, an average person might be able to save 50€ if they're lucky
Wow 27
In Greece you're supposed to be finishing university at 22-23(except doctors) . Most people finish at 24 but above that you're considered a failure
Why is it so different in Sweden
I like it
Ye, I would also have to disagree
Europe once had the resources to provide such a structure (super-inflated pensions, social welfare, free healthcare etc) both through strategic advantages vs the rest of the world and because young folks contributed to social security funds
Nowadays Europe lacks in both
We may still have financial services, some cars, tourism, education, but we are steadily falling behind
The majority of our top-notch tech is being made in Asia or in the US, and our energy comes from Russia or the middle East
Young people, also, are making less money compared to their parents (in same price levels), yet have to contribute to greatly higher pensions than their parents had to
The system is almost some kind of an elaborate pyramid scheme, where younger populations support the benefits of the retired ones
And as such, it needs a constant influx of young workers just like a pyramid constantly needs new sellers
Which contradicts the overpopulation issue of the planet
Under these circumstances, Europe should by no means be providing free welfare any more, especially to potential workers that have so far made zero contribution to our funds
What should happen is a rationalization of Europe's welfare system
Since this would happen in favor of the younger populations and against the older ones, no soon-to-be retired political figure would dare to deal with it
We start uni right after high school, nobody does a gap year here
Basically it's a mentality of: high school -> university-> find a job
I wasn't talking about graduating from a master's, sorry for the confusion
Of course if people do a master's then they graduate later
We choose the field we want to study at 18, we give general exams(not specific ones in each university)based on that field, so we have a variety of departments to choose from
We make a list and then it depends on our scores and on other students scores, so in reality you can end up in a department that wasn't your first or second choice
However, even if people don't like what they're studying they don't drop out cause you **have to finish it**. It's sad to be honest but I can understand the pressure, it's the way/mentality that has always been
It is a lot of pressure and this is why we finish our bachelor in 5 or 6 years instead of 4 which is the official duration
Haha I wish the children thing was true here, people actually don't have money to raise kids so in the past years after the economical crisis the birth rate is lower than the death rate
Cretans are the first to freeze to death in 10°C and we are the first to die of a heat stroke in 25°C
Greeks and Italians had had this debate for centuries, Italians like their pasta al dente, and us greeks like them mushy
I’ve tried both and personally prefer them mushy, but that might be because it reminds me of my mothers cooking
I definitely like it al dente
what kind of barbarian does this
on topic i like them al dente too, if they are too cooked it's like eating vomit with hair
We don't throw toiler paper in the toilet, instead we have a basket next to it with a plastic bag attached inside it and we throw it there
When it gets full, we empty the basket by removing the bag and then we install a new one
That we all act way too rich for pretty much a third world country, I guess
Correct
The pipe that comes from the toilet in individual buildings is smaller than normal, not the sewer system
It isn't really a problem though, there is an extendable showerhead right beside the toilet in every bathroom
Wash your butt in the toilet, mushing poop on your skin isn't sanitary
I find them a bit silly for how "easy" it is in English and how big of a deal they make out of it at least from what little I know about these things
In Greek there are a more than 9 letters that sound the exact same but you have a gazillion spelling and grammar rules that dictate when you use what
Then you have special occasions, ancient Greek roots etc
I can see a school having a local competition but nothing more that that
However they are often questions in TV games
Like for example
Pick the correct spelling of the word message
Μινυμα
Μεινιμα
Μοινοιμα
Μινιμα
Μινημα
Μυνιμα
Μυνημα
Μήνυμα
These are just a few of the possible of combinations and you would read them all the same, the question usually have a combination of υ η and I since the correct spelling is the last one (if you notice autocorrect picked that one and filled the acute on η)
Many native speakers often confuse the last two choices
Then as a bonus you also have spellings that are both accepted, for example
Beer => μπύρα or μπίρα
Egg => αυγό or αβγό
Then again in the spelling bees I remember that they often use hard words which sound easy for me because their ancestry is Greek, like for example any medical term
Were I would struggle is to spell it out quickly but then again I am not a native speaker, if you allowed me to right it down first I think I would be fine
Take this word for example,
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconios
Half if Greek half is Latin, still a bitch of a word but if I could right it down as I hear it I think I could manage, but if I had to spell it out in 8 seconds after hearing it, yeah no good luck with that
But I don't feel like you can call that a word, it's a bunch of words (the literal meaning of the word) fused together
You can do a shit tone of fuckery with this, there is a single word that is like 5 sentences in an ancient Greek play and it's basically a recipe with all the ingredients fused together into on word
Or a usual suspect when thinking of big word back when i was a kid
Σκουληκομυρμηγκότρυπα
Which is the fuse of worm-ant-hole and guess what it means
There are also some math/science competitions, if I remember correctly but that's about it
I agree it seems to be a cultural difference
Definitely not by counting votes from each state for over a day
We elect 300 members of parliament (βουλευτές), the party that has over 150 seats is tasked with forming a government and traditionally the party leader becomes the prime minister
In case the leading party has less seats, the president tasks them to explore the possibility of making a multi-party/coalition(?) government, otherwise we vote again
Our president is elected by the members of parliament and has no executive powers
They just replace the old puppet with a new puppet and they keep doing the same shit
Quite the opposite I would say
Parents here and the society in general pressure you to not proceed with making a family before you mature enough, figure out what you're gonna do in life and/or find a stable income
It is generally expected that you start thinking about marriage only after the ages of 28-30
With women though, that is not completely the rule as they start facing pressure from their inner circle as their friends begin to get married and have children
I don't know if that is self-imposed or actual externally imposed pressure
There is some pressure, as soon as i got out of the university got to feel it . My mother was always questing when i ll got married and she would see grandchildren ... I didn't even had a gf at that point and that kept happening for years, a decade at least ... She was driving me crazy
Now that i am 34 she has calmed down i think
My Mom tells me every day
Every time my aunts see me they say the same thing
My Dad and Uncles might say it once every 6 months
Trust me I doubt it's self umposed
We may want to have children but more in a sense of someday
But the pressure usually comes from family members and colleagues . I.e. a couple of days ago a colleague of mine told me i m borderline in the middle of being late as when she was 31 she had both her sons
Like I'm going to ολως τυχαιως μυρίσω τον κρίνο και θα μείνω έγκυος since I'm single
So while I would say society nowadays has stop the pressure it also depends on the family and environment .
* Attica: Big city problems, rude, touristic, yells at drivers, fast paced, thinks they are better than Thessaloniki, needs stuff to happen **NOW
* Thessaloniki: Same as above -except calmer- dislikes Atticians

Thrace: Lots of muslims
Epirus and Ionian islands: Friendly, kind and cool
The probem with Crete is that they have around half a million population
And they fit your description (Mani is tiny, noone cares)
Thessaloniki and rural Macedonia have issues with localism,feeling "neglected" and blaming everything on Athens
And they have a ridiculous accent
Olive oil pump
[This object] is used to pump olive oil out of large containers, which every household in Greece has
We all know someone in a village from whom we get supplied large containers (5+ liters) with the best fresh olive oil that is sold word to mouth rather than buying supermarket olive oil
Much much better, much cheaper and you know the source
They fortunately are standard equipment in Greece too
Some Older Greek houses also have this three prong plug
It's awesome, we all have our personal oil buckets hahah
That's definitely a close second
Yup haha, even if you open both half the flow will be boiling
Having lived for a while in England, Germany, Spain and Ireland and visited 4 more European countries, I would like for Greece :
Spain's cheap and reliable public transport
I could go anywhere in Zaragoza by tram and the price was lower than the bus prices in Greece
The tram had a fixed time of arrival and you knew you wouldn't be late
Dublin's safe feeling in the city center
In Athens sometimes you feel you have walked into Karachi or Mogadishu at night if you walk alone in some areas
The big green spaces in the city that are found in England
Greek cities lack green
24/7 supermarkets (from England again)
Youth hotspots in the city being super gay friendly (cheers again Spain
For our big cities to actually feel like they fit in Europe, they are all ugly, dirty and have shit infrastructure, you can't look at capital cities in Europe, and then take a look at Athens and be like "ah yes, this is an EU capital". All of Greece's big cities are ugly actually, only the islands are nice, but it makes up for it when you can go to an island in summer by boat
Living in Dublin, all these issues are secondary
The first and foremost issue that it seems that Irish politicians don't give a shit about is the absurd price of rents
I should not have to pay 800+ per month for a small room in a shared flat in Dublin
Really
Why tho
Here every small cafe and kiosk has pos
Ive even seen pos at certain open air producers markets
many taxis also got one
You still might get weird looks if you try to pay 30 cents with card, but one coffee is totally acceptable
Oh yeah
In Stuttgart I was always getting the impression that almost all the employees above the age of mid20s were unwilling to help even a tiny bit further than they were strictly obliged too
They preferred blank stares
The worst thing is that NO political party seems to acknowledge it as a problem or willing to do anything about it
They only talk about social housing, building new houses etc etc
Nothing about lowering the rents to more affordable prices
The Sinn Fein is mostly caring about the rents that people that can barely make enough for living pay (which is good of course, but that is not the only problem with rents, because I can pay  it doesn't mean that I *should* pay that much), and are also almost completely ignoring the rents for students and other people around my age
Having lived in many different places, this is the one that I found Southern Europe is much more "humane" than the rest : cheap rents
In Spain I had a huge room in a shared flat in the center of Zaragoza for
250 euros
Oh yeah right lel
I think that was a huge thing here as well
But now its super easy to pay with card and avoid it
Of course, that leaves you with little room for haggling
But some still offer the no-receipt price lel
That is not true
Stuttgart was exactly like this
Except for supermarkets, I was struggling to find anything accepting credit/debit cards
Germany has a cash obsession
It is a very slow procedure, that would
a) take years to show any results,
b) drop the rent prices in the suburbs of Dublin - and then you would need to commute, so the overall expense would be the same,
c) is a bit of a moot point cause Dublin's population is growing faster than the housing market, because of the job opportunities
The goal should be to make accommodation affordable, not just offer more accommodation in the same more or less price
Cap them
Give tax benefits to landlords who rent the appartments at cheaper prices
Hairdressers/Barbers - everything that didn't have extremely high prices was accepting only cash
Every small shop owner by Turkish-origin Germans
Bars/cafes that had very often a "broken" card reader
if you think about it every city in Greece is an old Greek city
my town was one of the 12 cities Thesseus united into Athens so we have the part with the ancient ruins, everything else is at best 1970s because the population of this town blew up in the 90s before that it was just some beach village
I'm pretty sure most parties use this as their motto at this point
There was a time when we had two leading parties (still do, just different ones)
The two heads were classmates and roommates in uni
The sirtaki from Zorbas and Zeibekiko tis Evdokias maybe
(Greece)
I would say the most famous song in terms how other countries know us is the sirtaki dance from the movie Zorba the Greek, which was composed by Mikis Theodorakis [
Omg there is also a greek version of this lovely song
"Apo kseno topo ki apo alargino"
And **Tis Dikaiosinis**, I would add
tbh, a couple of personal favourites are I agapi mou stin Ikaria and Pedia tis Samarinas, though many act kinda haughty when listening to the latter or other demotika, no idea why
We have a city called Kastoria (beaver) and a town called Astakos (lobster) even though neither of those animals live anywhere near there
not a location but we call pork tenderloin "psaronefri" (ψαρονέφρι) which literally means fish kidney and no one understands why
Who makes that claim
I can only think of the extra right
But isn't the whole point about getting rid of countries
First of all, that's quite a leap
Extremists
It's quite the opposite in my opinion
Also, the main opponents of unification are usually citizens of the "big countries", that think they will have to go backward and get the short end of the stick in order to help the smaller countries, something that -admittedly- already happens to an extent, within the eurozone especially
Of the federalization, not everyone's.
Well, states still exist in federalist unions, like the US for example
Nations are arbitrary constructs anyway, and they will exist of course after a potential unification
Countries won't.
But, thinking ahead, in 2-3 generations after the unification of Europe, the national identities will be brushed aside, not eliminated, and the European identity will be prevalent
So there will be no "big country" or "small country" citizen
Of course, some "provinces" will be richer than others, as is the case in any country, but ultimately the common identity is what pro/pan-Europeans are promoting
Even geopolitically, as that seems to be a concern of yours, a federalization will be truly beneficial for Europe, which is mainly competing with Russia, China, and the US on the global stage
Unfortunately, the EU, at its current form, is too slow and fragmented to pose as a serious antagonist to these superpowers
Sleeping well, not so much
I would argue there is time for proper meals, save for people in corporate jobs and maybe large supermarkets
Small businesses, pharmacies, doctor's offices, lawyers, and the public sector are closed during lunchtime, for at least 3-4 hours, which a lot of people take advantage of to eat lunch (lunch is our main meal in Greece) and maybe nap
Depending on your job you may or may not have enough time to sleep properly, but in general Greeks will go to sleep around 12am - 2am and have various waking times
For the past decade and a half, the members of one parish in Athens celebrate Easter by [throwing Molotov cocktails in the road outside the church when the priest says "Christ has risen
".]
If Athens is a the shithole of of europe wait until you see the rest of Greek "villages". The exception of course is the nature, monuments and a few islands
You know how people will often say: "french people have it easy learning Spanish because the two languages have similarities, it's not fair to us (Scandinavians, Slavic people, etc)" and the same deal with other combinations
Fear no more, nobody speaks languages similar to ours, so it's going to be an equal pain to everyone to learn
Except for Greeks and Cypriots, but there's only like 11-12 millions of us so who cares
Greek was actually lingua franca in the eastern mediteranean region for many centuries
Pro: There are a lot of sources in the region that are written originally in greek, (Plato, Socrates even the New Testament)
Many english words specially scientific ones have their root on a greek word, and knowing greek they can be understood better
Against: Greece has a different alphabet, not the latin one
Many of the ancient sources are not written in modern greek but in ancient greek or koine greek, which is hard to be read even from greeks
There aren't any close languages to greek you can understand, only words
For the same reasons, italian could be the next lingua france since there are a lot of sources in latin and spanish/french will be easy to learn
I guess knowing german would also beneficial due to many similar languages, but I don't know that for sure
Many alphabets are based on Greek
Also it was already the lingua franca before so why not again
Againist this would be the fact that η, υ, ι, ει, οι all sound like "ee" and that ε, αι both sound like "eh". Kinda weird of you ask me
Edit: It would also be neat being able to understand what many weird words used in other languages really mean
(mathematics, physics, geography, Gaia, photography, logotype, mega, hyperbole, psycho, center, diarrhea
It's the language from thr birthplace of western civilization, you already use many words from this language and it is a very structured a logical language, pronunciation of words has easy and clear to follow rules
Cons: You think spelling is hard until you meet Greek, then it's gets worse, much much more worse
ω ο
η ι υ ει οι
γγ γκ
Just from the top of my head
When there's Rome ,Eastern Romans *always* tag along
We'd still have an advantage, modern Greek is an oversimplified version of classical Greek, plus we have compulsory ancient Greek subjects throughout middle and high school
Plus, we'd get to make fun of the Erasmian accent, since the modern accent is actually closer to classical accent than his try according to scholars
Look up Zolotas speech on YouTube
He's an ex PM of ours that at some point delivered a speech in English using entirely Greek loanwords
He was Dutch, he wasn't acclimated to the Greek alphabet or the language's intricacies
While his efforts were valiant and advanced the understanding of how our ancestors spoke back then, Greek scholars have reconstructed a pronunciation that is closer to how the ancient tongue was spoken
I know who you mean, but that's in modern times, where one can have videos to get examples, can have a study partner to help with accent etc
Erasmus didn't have that, being used to his mother tongue, some stuff didn't make sense for him, others were hard to use when speaking
He made arbitrary decisions in some cases, and it being an academic project for him rather than a language he aimed to use outside of academic circles, he couldn't practice the language, and since he also tried to reconstruct it, in many cases he was "treading blind"(βάδιζε στα τυφλά)
I think that's apparent in the remarks towards the end of the wikipedia article, where his omissions are listed
Ever heard of the Greco Turkish war
1821, we should never go independent
I want to die: -10°C and below
Cold: -9°C -- -2°C
Chilly: -1 -- 9°C
Perfectly Cool: 10°C -- 19°C
Perfectly Perfect: 20°C -- 23°C
Perfectly Warm: 24°C -- 29°C
Warm: 30°C -- 35°C
Hot : 36°C and above
All of this depends so much on humidity though
A dry and breezy 5°C (or 30°C) can feel great in a sweater and a hat (or t-shirt and shorts)
but rainy, humid 5°C (or 30°C) sucks the life force out of you
When I was last in Ireland it hit humid 25°C and I wanted to die, then came back to Greece and it was dry and 30°C and it felt so much cooler and nicer
unpopular opinion, but I'm really jealous
As someone who had to go through some big chunk of time without proper sun and daylight (due to health reasons) the end results of that really aren't the best for you
It's very different from what you probably are imagining
Sun and vitamin D are really important
I personally consider the entire history of the Byzantine Empire to be a plot hole
Throwing a tantrum for the colour of the flag doesn't seem like a great mindset to me
Rød grød med fløde
Even though I speak danish now (well sort of) this was one of the first things I learned to say in danish
It's a really good way to practice /ʁ/ and /ð̠ˠ/ too
Once used the word smattering amount with an Irish person and he instantly complimented my knowledge of english as a second language

We give ourselves as an example to avoid
In greek its either καλομαθημένος (someone who is used to living easy/well), but also κακομαθημένος (some who is used to living "bad") (bad meaning spoiled)
In Greek we call them "Υπερπροστατευτικους γονείς" =Overprotective parents
I live in Athens, I've never been to the Parthenon, or the acropolis in general
I've only been to museums and some ancient monuments and stuff with school trips, but mostly outside of Athens
Of course, I have seen it many many times from afar when driving, but never actually been there
Yes and no
My town has its own cave, and during the 90s and up until the 2007 crisis, it was an active tourist attraction
I visited it as part of a class trip back in elementary, but ever since, I have only been there once, for a stroll in the parking lot because of the view
Supposedly it has been revived, but with the pandemic and all, it's kind of a no-go
We have a great laography museum too, it's been used for small concerts etc and was donated by a past mayor considered to be the most respected person to have ever held office in my town, but sadly I've never been there, neither to the local winery/wine museum, nor to the theatre/estate an actor built as an homage to ancient and byzantine era traditions
I grew up in Athens, never went on the Parthenon until I was like 16yo and we had some foreign visitors
well i live in Greece so the place is pretty much filled with tourist sites, if it wasn't for school trips i would have never visited the museum of my town, the Akropolis, the ancient Athenian agora and other ancient stuff
I don't think we have a general one used for anything, but we have one specific way of counting that we used when we were the seeker in hide and seek as kids
I remember that every seeker counted in fives with an inflection of voice that kinda made it rhyme
"Πέντε-Δέκα-Δεκαπέντε-Είκοσι-Εικοσιπέντε..."
(Pente-Deka-Dekapente-Ikosi-Ikosipente
"5-10-15-20-25
And we used to count up like this up to 100 and them we left to find the hiders
I don't think we use a specific method
We just count "ena, dyo, tria
" (1,2,3) and so on
Although some Greek guy in the comments said we use the "thousand-one, thousand-two,..." variant
But I'm not really sure we do
Haven't heard it ever
fellow Greeks in this thread say we don't have one, but I remember a family friend teaching me "ένας ελέφαντας / enas elefadas", meaning one elephant, as a way to count
Same in Greece, I don't think there's something like the Germans or Dutch have
Its just ena (pause) dyo (pause) tria etc maybe that's why our deadline estimates are a bit off :P
But the Mississippi thing I had learned as a child with Ross from Friends (not the dj) in the tanning place
I thought it was just Americans that had it but evidently it's other countries too
One thousand - one
One thousand - two
Although in Greek "one thousand" is only 2 syllables
Χίλια - ένα
Χίλια - δύο
^^^/u/my_other_account_471
If you see this thread, there are more countries that do this
Yes we do
We also have University entrance exams and it is very likely that attempting to get into law, medicine, electrical engineering or in the army my lead to irrepearable damage to your psyche
But that's because it is very competitive
For example I got into the top 500 of my country and probably in the top 300 in my field and failed to get into electrical engineering in Athens that accepted 250 students a year
Tangentially, In Greece polytechnics are the way to go if you can finish them
Otherwise the Army if you can be accepted into the Academy
Croatia by far
Somehow they are portrayed as victims of bad Serbs ONLY
They collaborated with the Nazis, destroyed the Yugoslav army from within by defections when Germany invaded, helped them happily kill Serbs and Jews, and had their part in the Bosnian wars as well
Second comes Ukraine, ALSO happy to embrace nazis throughout history to get rid of Russians, until very very recently
I hear you guys, but the top answer should be Croatia
In fact the reason it's not the top answer is because it's so good at doing exactly what the question says
Why should you blame anyone for the Balkan wars
Do you think they were unjustified
Does your country have autonomous regions
In what way are they autonomous
Economically
Culturally
Politically
Yeah, we have an autonomous peninsula which is inhabited and ran by orthodox monks
Honestly, I don't think our government has any substantial power over the region, they just do their own thing, have their own rules (ex
no women or female animals are allowed within a half mile radius from the shore) and I highly doubt they actually pay taxis like us lay people
*does anyone know what happens to female cats and birds
Like how do they keep them out
Do they even make an effort
Well since i see that you are from Greece too you should have told them about our semi-independent part of our country Mt Athos or The holy mountain
It is has its own laws and capital and it is governed by a college of the heads of each monastery (It is sort of a monastic order)
The most strange thing is though that it has a legally recognized abaton meaning that women are forbidden to enter it for any reason
Are the islanders all fluent in Finnish as well
The Basque Country and Navarre get to keep most of their tax income as well I believe
We are humbled that you went through the trouble of writing about this
I could add that it is most commonly called Agio Oros
I'm guessing the Vatican is not included, from what I read it's like a city state but it's treated more like an autonomous region
First time I'm reading this tbh
The ban afaik mentions women only, because Athos is dedicated to Virgin Mary, which is where it gets its nickname, "Garden of Virgin Mary". In one incident, even Katherine the Great of Russia was denied entry by the monks because of that
Ok, that makes sense
Sunday school failed me, that's for sure lol
Well the island I come from, Corfu, would no longer be a part of Greece since it was a part of the French Empire until 1814
I'm not sure about the rest of the Ionian islands though because the British had already conquered some of them
If they're not a part of the French Empire, they are either under British occupation or a part of Greece
Greece also loses the small coastal town of Parga  since it was a part of the Venetian Republic
The British sold the town to the Ottomans when they took over all the islands in our timeline
We dont have those 'language' lessons in my university
As a student in the final year and currently struggling with my dissertation, googling how to do everything like structure, fonts, proper speech and listing sources, uh
thank you for trying
You couldn't get to all of your students anyway, but a positive attitude is really helping out
Also, i find it really great when my professors post material to study or the lectures themselves so we can check them out anytime
Do we really have something better to do during lectures
Propably no, but you know what i mean
Then we can just binge watch the lectures, cause stress is the best motivator
>  As a student in the final year and currently struggling with my dissertation, googling how to do everything like structure, fonts, proper speech and listing sources,
Yeah I remember greek profs telling us to follow "general rules" when writing essays yet never bothered to actually inform us of these rules
WTF
This drove me CRAZY
I asked; what style should i use to list my sources
They said; whatever is fine as long as its correct
I used Harvard style
And then they were like; hmmmmm you know what no, do it in APA
Fuck me
I say they dont need to explain speech and stuff, its trouble but we can figure it out
But they never even *explain* the proper structure of an assignment
Only my mentor prof took the time to do that
And it took me countless google searches in English, translations and searching for papers and essays in greek to figure some stuff out
All it takes for us to understand is a pretty power point from someone who knows this stuff, please
Hahaha i just checked it out thanks for trying anyway:) ill just stick to english tutorials and material, nothing is ever written in greek anyway
Do you not feel like its the biggest waste of your time
I felt that way, and greek is literally my native language
And to comfort us our teachers would say 'dont you complain, theres people taught the same texts in other countries that dont even know greek'. Yeah, f that

Prehistory - 31 BC City States and Kingdoms, subdued by the Romans,
395 -1461 AD Byzantine Empire & Trebizond (Not sure if they Count), Subdued by the Ottomans,
1821 - 1940, 1944 - Today, Modern Hellenic Republic
We oficially lost independence when the Romans came - the battle of Corinth in 146 BC marks the beginning of Roman domination
Afterwards, the various regions passed from one master to another (Romans, Arabs, Ottomans, Venetians, French, Englishmen) until we finally got independence in 1830, roughly 2000 years later
They were basically ethnically Greek Roman citizens
Ρωμιοσύνη, Ρωμιοί, Ρωμιός, Ρωμιά in the Greek language means ethnic Greek that follows the Greek Orthodox Faith
The modern Greek state was created by Ρωμιοί. We still call ourselves that
They are all synonym for greek
It was independent, but not Greek
It was Roman
They called it the (Eastern) Roman Empire, or Romania, but never "Greece". The only reason why it ever existed was the Romans conquering land
It's not like the Roman Empire fell and we gained independence; it went on like before, as Romans
Vienna
I don't really know why
I think it was so over hyped by the people I was traveling with that I was disappointed when I went there
Or maybe it was because I truly loved the city I visited just a day before (Budapest) and in comparison Vienna lost
Istanbul
Due to the way that Turkey has treated it
I wouldn't say i was disappointed, but i was certainly unimpressed
It was Budapest, because it reminded me of Prague
I also didn't like Prague and the older Checzs in general
Me too mate
I live in Thessaloniki
Well, Bolzano would disagree with you
Yeah I thought the same
Maybe during some other time of the year, for instance in Christmas, it would be prettier

It's honestly ugly as fuck in most places, but every graffiti stains and locked down/semi-demolished shop has its own history
Most are not that great, but there are some crazy good shit like [god's hands turning towards the people to pray

What I'm saying is that Milan has always been considered an Italian city, whereas Bolzano has only been considered Italian since 1918 and still feels distinctly un-Italian
it's much easier to have an 'Italian experience' in Milan than Bolzano

Now you can also start making fun of our subway system which was supposed to be finished around 2010s but it wont be finish earlier than 2021, and that's just the very basic of the basic line

Start with Mesopotamian civilizations, ancient Egypt then Persia
Then of course we spend years on ancient Greece, then Rome then Byzantium
We don't talk much about the medieval history unless Byzantium is involved, we dot he schism, crusader and then the discovery of the Americas and the natives
Then we do napoleon, American independence, civil war, then ww1, ww2, Balkan wars, population exchange with turkey and st that point we stop
They do not touch the Greek Civil War much or the military juntas (apart for the polytechnic school event) or any modern history for that matter
There are "sources" as they are called, small extra patches of history for a number of topics and the book does have much history for all that I mentioned but we mostly skip or just mention many of the above
Time is limited and higher focus is given to ancient Greece, Greek-Rome events, Byzantium and ww2
The letter "H" is one of the three "I's" in the Greek alphabet
The equivilant to an English "H" is "X" in Greek, and we pronaunce it "Chi" as in "Hill" (not Chile)
e.g.
Χάος = Chaos but we actually pronaunce it as "Haos"
We don’t have it lol
We use χ and pronounce it like the word “he”
In Greek the letter looks like Χ/χ. There’s no English equivalent but it’s like a throaty h
I know this isn't what you meant but the letter "Η" is pronounced as ee/i in Greek; it is the capital version of the letter η which means the feminine version of "the"
In the romanization of the Greek alphabet it only occurs in the diphthongs "ch" which is pronounced [/x/] and "th" which is pronounced [/θ/]
We have it lol, but it's not related to "h".
It's the capital "η" and it is pronounced like "ee".
> We use χ and pronounce it like the word “he”
Not exactly
We use /x/ or /ç/ while "he" uses /h/ which is a completely different sound
The difference between /x/ and /ç/ depends on the vowel that follows the letter
χα, χο, χου all use /x/ while χε and χι both use /ç/, try it for yourself, say these syllables out loud and you'll notice the difference
Nope, we pronounce all foreign words exactly as you would too, we just write them differently, since the equivilant to a Latin "X"  is the letter "Ξ" (ksi) in our alphabet
E.g. Xylophone, xylographie, xenophil etc
are Greek words so we definitely can pronaunce an "X" the correct way
Έχεις δίκιο. Συνειδητοποίησα τώρα ότι το Ηράκλειο πχ στα Αγγλικά είναι Heraklion
Το Ηράκλειο είναι στα αγγλικά Heraklion για΄τί το ήτα στα ελληνικά έπαιρνε κάποτε δασεία. Το αγγλικό h στις αγγλικές λέξεις ελληνικής προέλευσης υποδηλώνει αυτή την δασεία. Πχ: history, hero, hyper
We actually say Ksiaomi
North Macedonia because I've seen online that they despise us
Turkey for as long as it continues to operate in the manners that they do
well they do have a train tunnel for getting goods into the state, you could probably fit through there
If anything, we should despise them
Which I don't but I'm just saying
Best wishes guys,hope you'll get rid of this dictatorship
Στου διαόλου τη μανα (at the devil's mother)
I was reminded of the phrase "at the devil's mother" (στου διαόλου την μάνα - stou diaolou ti mana) by another redditor
I've also heard the slightly altered phrase: στου διαόλου το κέρατο- stou diaolou to kerato, which means "at the devil's horn".
I sometimes also use the phrase: στην άλλη άκρη του θέου - stin alli akri tou theou, which means "at God's other side/edge/point". I'm not sure if I translated correctly
It's used where I live, but I don't know if it's used all over Greece
Στου διαόλου τη μάνα - At the devil's mom
Στου διαόλου το κέρατο - At the devil's horn
In Greece we say Στου διαόλου την μάνα which translates at the devil's mother
We say the same in Greece as well
Dont forget άνω κωλοπετεινίτσα (upper kolopetinitsa, which does not exist afaik) and στου διαολου τον κώλο/το κέρατο (at the devils ass/horn)
I really like στο μουνι της μανας του
> which does not exist afaik
It does [exist] but not as "upper kolopetinitsa", it is "Tritaia" now and it is located in near Itea, Phocis
It was called that \[Kalopetinitsa\] due to the high quality of it's roosters used in cockfights
The name came into prominence following the rather successful 1959 movie "[Vacations to Kolopetinitsa] starring Kostas Hatzihristos and Spyros Fokas (filmed in location in the village)
You really won't miss all that much if you decide to go there; just another regular old village filed to brim with really old folk, nice view to the Bay Of Corinth though
\[Source: My father's paternal village is nearby
We have gone on day trips there once or twice growing up
Χαχαχα το κερασακι στην τουρτα!
When I was in the US twenty or so years ago, some college students were shocked to see a Greek magazine
They thought we must still be in togas and in little white houses with no electricity by the beach
They couldn’t believe that Greeks can produce a magazine and were especially shocked when they opened it and saw cars being advertised because that meant we also drive cars
Ah yes, the good old "but isn't all of Greece like Santorini
Self defense laws are shitty and in away they help the perpetrator
Even having a small knife is considered illegal and you will be charged like having an actual gun
Same applies for pepper spray, electric teaser
Most of Europe has the same self-defense laws, self defense must be appropriate to the offense
Meaning if someone breaks in and they see you and then run away you can't chase them down with a sword and hack them in the back whether that is in your house or on the street
You are just supposed to call the police and then they beat the shit out of them with their "reasonable" force
Law isn't perfect and a lot of people make fake crime scenes because of it
no as far as i know our military police is only used in military bases and on border checkpoints
The Germanderie (Χωροφυλακή)  was merged with City Police (Αστυνομία Πόλεων) to became Greek Police (Ελληνική Αστυνομία), which is not a military body
It has jurisdiction on both cities and rural areas
&#x200B;
Funnily Αστυνομία means literally City (Άστυ) and law (νόμος) making the modern's force name not very accurate and the old Αστυνομία Πόλεων redundant as it was literally City-Police for Cities
they also have tax police on the borders, port police, local police, forest police
And if that wasn't enough the military also do guard duties in train stations and central squares
It reminds me of Greece pre- crisis
The word "panic" (πανικός in greek) comes from the name of the ancient Greek God Pan
Either because of a foul mood or because he wanted to play a mean prank, Pan used to terrify mortals who would roam in the wilderness
He would hide in the woods and stalk the mortals, making his presence barely felt at the beginning just to cause unease and then all of a sudden he would jump out of hiding with a terrifying shriek and chase them off
The terror the mortals felt when they encountered him like this, came to be called "Panic".
&#x200B;
There's a story about it which has Pan causing panic to the Persians in the battle of Marathon
And a more detailed story concerning Dionysus' campaign against India, which Pan took part of
According to this story, Pan and his allies found himself trapped canyon with very few soldiers at his command
There he instructed his solders at nightfall to start screaming
The screaming became louder with the echo from the canyon and the enemies panicked and fled
&#x200B;
Anyway, the ancient Greeks used to associate this irrational fear that we call a panic attack today with the God Pan, and therefore we have the word "Panic".
Εφιάλτης (Efialtes) = Nightmare, and also the guy who betrayed the Spartans at the battle of Thermopyle
Εγκέλαδος (Engelados) = Earthquake, and also a name of a Titan, son of Tartarus and Gaia, who shook the earth whenever he was pissed off
Νύχτα (Nychta) from ancient Greek Νυξ (Nyx) = Night, and also the ancient goddess of the darkness, daughter of Chaos and sister of Erebus
Νάρκισσος (Narkissos) = narcissist, and also the guy who loved admiring his reflection on the water for so long that he eventually died from it
There's literally hundreds if not thousands of those, can't list them all
That's very interesting
The phrase "panic attack" gains a whole new meaning
Both are correct and mean the exact same thing, with Engelados being a more formal definition
You research a random word we use in our every day conversations and 3 out of 5 times there's always an ancient myth or story behind it
People had to come up with words and names for things, and what better way then using myths and story references to do so
Since Greek is one of the oldest spoken languages still in use it's pretty normal  to discover those references even today
Pretty fascinating thow
In modern parlance it's always "the strike of Enceladus" when refering to earthquakes, and it pretty much only appears in news reports as it's ridiculously pompous for everyday conversation
Nobody will ever say "hey did you feel that Enceladus last night
" for instance, and the word seismos is already pretty formal being archaic itself, it's why we also say seismology in Greek, instead of something like shakeology, which would be the more informal equivalent
Of course we use seismos in our modern parlance for the reason you described, but the fact that you know what an Engelados is without the need of looking it up actually proves my point, I didn't say we use it all the time
It's like the fireplace, using the word fotia or tzaki to describe it, doesn't mean that the word Estia is wrong, or that the other two are the correct ones
Or the moon, we always use the medieval Greek feggari but when someone uses the ancient Greek Selini we know exactly what he's talking about and don't look at him like he's some weird intellectual
I thought you meant Enkelados is interchangeable with the word seismos, which as far as I know does not happen in any context
Estia for fireplace in not wrong per se, but if it happens at all it must be pretty unusual
Closest common usage I can think of is referring to *the hestia of the fire* or *multiple hesties* to mean active wildfire hotspots
Using derivatives of hestia to mean *focus* or *housing* is much more common
Spot on for Feggari/Selene
Oh boooy if that's not a question
We study history a LOT
and over and over again, even through different subjects (such as ancient literature)
We have 6 years primary school, 3 years middle school, 3 years highschool (finishing at 18yo)
I will call them year 1-12 just for simplicity
\*History\*
Years 1-2 you are still baby so at most you learn some ancient Greek mythology
Year 3: From mythology to history (intro to ancient history)
&#x200B;
Year 4: History - Ancient Greece (Geometric Period, Archaic Period, Classical Period, Hellenistic Period)
Year 5: Roman times (early AD), Byzantine Empire (\~500AD - 1500AD)
Year 6: Ottoman occupation (1500 > 1821 (greek independence revolution))
Year 7 (middle school starts): Ancient History but deeper
&#x200B;
Year 8:  Byzantine and european medieval history
&#x200B;
Year 9: Modern History (1821 - 1990)
Year 10 (high school starts): Ancient History (including more diverse civilizations in Asia)
&#x200B;
Year 11: From Justinian reforms (565) until the Treaty of Vienna (1815)
Year 12: 1815-Today in depth
&#x200B;
\*Ancient Greek Literature/History Classes\*
&#x200B;
Year 7: Herodotus Histories (Persian Wars) - translated to modern greek
&#x200B;
Year 7-8: Homer's Oddyssey and Iliad - translated
&#x200B;
Year 9: Arrian - Alexander's Ascendency (History of Alexander the Great) - translated
&#x200B;
Back when I was in school in the 90s we also did a bunch of Religious History (mostly medieval) in a ton of depth, especially the relationship between Orthodox and Catholic church
We also did some more historical texts such as Thucydides History
Bottom line --- we go craaaazy with History
Imagine having about 2500 years of history
We learned mostly about Ancient Greece, the Byzantine Empire, Ottoman Empire 400 years Occupation, and the 1821 Revolution against it
There was no time for WW1, WW2, the period in-between, post-WW2 civil war, and the military dictatorship that followed
It's strange to only learn about distant times and ignore the most recent and relevant ones
Now that I am older I also realise that history classes were mostly aimed at forcing nationalism and pride upon children
Not being taught about recent history, while glorifying the positive aspects of ancient times can fuck up generations
We were never taught that ancient greeks built their civilization on slavery and unpaid woman work
How democracy was only for few privilledged men
How philosophers were executed for their ideas, and how often civil wars occured
I'm not saying it was not a great civilization, but I would have prefered to get a more unbiased view on it
Also, not teaching children about WW2, wtf
Well you can't always study and learn everything but here's how the structure is
Three big time periods
1st: 3500BC  \~ 330AC (The biggest one that we usually skip some of it)
Mesopotamian Civilizations, Egyptians, Minoans, Mycenaeans, City-States, Persian Wars, The Golden Age of Athens, Peloponnesian War, Macedonians, Alexander the Great, The Rise of Rome, Roman Empire until the foundation of Constantinople
2nd: 330AC \~ 1453AC
Basically everything that happened in the Byzantine Empire until the fall of Constantinople from the Ottomans
(Emperor Constantine, Emperor Justinian, Ιnternal conflicts regarding Christianity, The Split of the Western and the Eastern Christian Church, The Crusades and at last the Rise of the Seljuks and the Ottomans)
3rd: 1453AC \~ until today (Here we give more importance)
The Discoveries, The Colonies, The Renaissance, The American revolution, The French revolution, The start and the evolution of the Greek revolution, The Industrial revolution and then the foundation of the first Greek state, WW1, Russian revolution, Balkan Wars, WW2, The Civil War, Cold War and at last the Crisis of '74
&#x200B;
We learn the 1st period at the 1st grade of Primary, Junior High and High School
(10-13-16 yo)
The 2nd in the 2nd grade of Primary, Junior High and High School
(11-14-17 yo)
And the 3rd in the 3nd grade of Primary, Junior High and High School
(12-15-18 yo)
When you go from Primary to Junior High to High School and study again the same time period  the books are supposed to give more depth and detail in the events
man, we didn't even make it to the 1900s
I live in Heraklion of Crete, a coastal town that has a continued existence as a port settlement since Minoan times
It's original Minoan name is not known anymore, if it even had one and wasn't just an expansion of Knossos
It was first called Heracleum after Crete became a Roman province
Which I guess translates as Herakles' city
Though why did they name it that, I have no clue
But that name did not stick for a while
During the Middle Ages, the island fell to Saracen conquest
Crete became an Emirate and in fact, the Saracens did much of the city building there, where as before it was a minor settlement and a port, it was then that it became a full-fledged city
The Saracens called the city Rabd al-Handaq, which means Castle of the Moat
After Nicephorus Phocas won the island back for the Byzantine Empire from the Saracens, the name was hellenized to Chandax (Χάνδαξ) which simply meant Moat
And after the Fourth Crusade, when Crete passed into Venetian leadership, the name of the city was latinized to Candia
When Venetians were ousted by the Ottomans, the name was turkified to Kandiye
And it's only in the modern era, when Crete finally became a part of the modern Greek state, that it's earliest known name had been restored to what it is now: Heraklion
&#x200B;
So to sum it up from a nameless Minoan port to the Roman Heracleum, the Saracen Rabd al-Handaq, the Byzantine Chandax, the Venetian Candia, the Ottoman Kandiye and finally the modern Greek Heraklion
The names either mean Moat or Herakles' City
[Artemis/Artemida]
In ancient Greece it was known as Brauron and was one of the most famous worshipping sites for [Artemis]
It also has a sort of nickname that was official for a while, Loutsa meaning "very wet" Because it was full of sand hills and when it rained it became almost a swamp
Edit: I forgot to mention that it was one of the 12 cities of Attica that Theseus united
The original name of the city was Θεσσαλονίκη Thessaloníkē. It was named after the princess Thessalonike of Macedon, the half sister of Alexander the Great, whose name means "Thessalian victory", from Θεσσαλός Thessalos, and Νίκη 'victory' (Nike), honoring the Macedonian victory at the Battle of Crocus Field (353/352 BC)
The city was created by joining the few villages and towns of the area by Cassander who married Thessaloniki and controlled Macedonia after Alexander's death, in 315 BC
Between the ancient name and it being readopted in 1912 with the incorporation of the city in the Greek state it was known as Saloniki, for many centuries
Athens or Athena Αθήνα in Greek, originates from the known ancient goddess Athena
Wikipedia article about her:
That's dope
iirc a relative told me as a kid that there used to be a church near the centre of town , in ancient times that is , outside of the pathway to koule that was to herakles (not the son of Zeus but the Dactyl one ) that was destroyed and only a part of it remains
idk that might have to do with its name
Huh, didn't know about the first naming
Actually now that you mentioned I have heard that story too
That one of the Kourites named Herakles who acted like bodyguard or baby Zeus and the city is named after him
yes yes thank you thats what im referring to
Roughly "köbnaun". [g̊ʰø̞b̥ənˈha̝u̯n] if you're familiar with the IPA
"Niaou". Don't @ me
Well Greek mythology has
First of all the [Sirens] (which is from where the mermaids are inspired from)
>the Sirens  were dangerous creatures, who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and singing voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island
[Charybdis]
>The sea monster Charybdis was believed to live under a small rock on one side of a narrow channel
Opposite her was Scylla, another sea monster, that lived inside a much larger rock
The sides of the strait were within an arrow-shot of each other, and sailors attempting to avoid one of them would come in reach of the other
To be "between Scylla and Charybdis" therefore means to be presented with two opposite dangers, the task being to find a route that avoids both
Three times a day, Charybdis swallowed a huge amount of water, before belching it back out again, creating large whirlpools capable of dragging a ship underwater
In some variations of the story, Charybdis was simply a large whirlpool instead of a sea monster
[Scylla]
> Scylla was a legendary monster that lived on one side of a narrow channel of water, opposite her counterpart Charybdis
The two sides of the strait were within an arrow's range of each other so close that sailors attempting to avoid Charybdis would pass dangerously close to Scylla and vice versa
> Scylla made her first appearance in Homer's Odyssey, where Odysseus and his crew encounter her and Charybdis on their travels
Later myth gave her an origin story as a beautiful nymph who gets turned into a monster
> The strait where Scylla dwelled has been associated with the Strait of Messina between Calabria, a region of Southern Italy, and Sicily, for example, as in Book Three of Virgil's Aeneid The coastal town of Scilla in Calabria takes its name from the mythological figure of Scylla and it is said to be the home of the nymph
Then although not usually linked with danger or death there were a bunch of water [Nymphs]
Such as the [Nerieds] , the [Limnads] and others
Sirens basically
Yes, Sirens would be the most similar to what OP is describing
I mean we are still part of Southern Europe fam :P
[Here you go]
>Do you have something similar in southern Europe
Maybe living in salt water on the coast
Wouldn't go down well here
Most areas have accents rather than dialects, or maybe use some idiomatic words so it would be rather easy to follow
However people that either speak a dialect or have a strong accent tend to be rather prideful of it (imo rightfully so) and would not want to alter it
But not all people who live in such areas follow the dialect or the accent
Plugs and sockets
Taxes ,laws and income
Souvlaki vs kalamaki
Backgammon
Definatelly backgammon
Whole families are not talking to each other, because of it
It's our national sport
To the people wondering why Greeks spend so many hours in cafés, it is because they are actually backgammon dojos that serve coffee

I love Italy
The vineyards, the northern mountains, Tuscany, the southern villages by the sea, the beautiful churches and art pieces, the culture, the food
I absolutely adore Portugal and Croatia
I kind of have an idea why, but I don’t go a week without thinking of going back to both of these places
I spent a month in Lazio
Best time of my life
Have a good day
I'll go with EU-issued, cause I often see confused looking faces when I show my "Hellenic Republic" passport
Would love an actual EU passport
I cannot for the life of me fathom why recent Greek passports only have "Hellenic Republic" written in Greek on the cover
More often than not I actually have to open up a page to prove it's Greek, 'cause guess what; not a lot of people outside Greece read Greek
Fancy that
Are you talking about [this] ?
This song isn't very very popular in Greece generally speaking
Κεφάλι, ώμοι, γόνατα και δάχτυλα
Κεφάλι, ώμοι, γόνατα και δάχτυλα
Ματάκια, αφτάκια, στόμα και μυτούλα
Κεφάλι, ώμοι, γόνατα και δάχτυλα.
The lyrics are exactly the same as in the English version
With the only exception, that in that line "Eyes, ears, mouth and toes"
the body parts are in demunitive
I did but the music was usually either 90s pop or the classic children’s songs like μια ωραια πεταλούδα etc
Maybe they had this one but I never payed attention
I had no idea that we had that song in Greek as well
I am shook
I remember this in kindergarten
Really
Didn't you go to playgrounds when you were little, in birthdays
I have never heard of that song either
Only the classics like Μια ωραία πεταλούδα, Κούνια μπέλα and Γύρω γύρω όλοι

Most disgraced is Akis Tsohatzopoulos
Coming from the left/centre-left wing then-ruling PASOK party, he was a prominent minister and almost became prime minister in 1996
His second wedding in Paris was seen as Gatsy style and provoked anger and then he became one of the very few convicted for corruption
The populist opinion here is that everyone is a bit corrupted and there are many former and current politicians that divide the masses and are very hated but also very loved by the people
But 'Akis' is seen as massively corrupted and there is propably not one person willing to defend even one thing he did in his career, when other politicians have many apologists defending them
So most disgraced is easily him
There is an english wikipedia article on him so you can see some more infos
The most prominent thing is the 'Siemens Scandal', the pinnacle of (known) corruption in Greek politics
Alexis tsipras propably
in greece its rock pencil scissors paper but no one actually uses pencil because no one knows what it does
exactly this, i always assumed it was because it sounds better
ive seen so many thoughts and opinions on what pencil does, but the whole point of the game is that each "thing" beats one and loses to another
That's only in the South, in Thessaloniki there's no stupid pencil
I hate the pencil addition, it ruins the mathematical balance of the game
Without the pencil, all options have 1/3 chance to win, 1/3 chance to fail and one 1/3 chance for a tie
With the stupid pencil however, rock and scissors have 2/4 chance of winning and pencil and paper have 2/4 chance of losing
Fuck the pencil
It's the same order in Greece, 'Πέτρα, ψαλίδι, χαρτί'.
Crazy, especially hârtie
Is this a personal attack or something
~ 200 but I buy some imported food too
I could probably do ~ 100
If they lived here permenently then yes I would let them vote as long as they had citizenship and did military service, I would also strip away that right from Greeks who live permenently on another country
In Greece we have opa and my favourite malaka
Συμφωνώ τώρα ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ )
"Μένω με το στόμα ανοιχτό" in Greek
Exact same
In Cyprus maybe
I can certainly talk to Cypriots even though there's a chance they'll only understand me without me understanding them
Same with Danes and my level of Danish
I think I wouldn't have a problem with German when it comes to travelling
**Maybe** I could talk to Spaniards as well but I'm not sure about that
As far as southern Albania
After that, I'd have to speak either english or french
I'm pretty sure most would try to be understandable but I'm only talking about the Cypriots' casual way of speaking
Oh and don't get me wrong I love how expressive your dialect is, compared to standard Greek

Albania of course
We joke about Albanians and the fact that some of them steal things
Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Germany, some jokes with French and Italians
Russia (as always), sometimes Germany, but mostly Greece itself (the common North - South "rivalry")
Edit: Albania as well
We tell a lot of racist jokes about Albania and Bulgaria
Also about Pontic Greeks for some reason
We also have a lot of jokes in the form of: There was one Italian, one British and one Greek etc
Same in Greece
Amazingly, both of these jokes exist here too, only with altered nationalities: on the first plane the Greek throws out the Albanian (can't remember the others);  on the 2nd, it's the American, the French, and again an Albanian instead of the Turk
Racist jokes due to the mass influx of Albanian immigrants back in the 90s.
its afternoon here
1^o C. I'm wearing  short pants and a hoodie and feeling warmish
i'm at home it's around 19-20
a cold room is 17 and below
for clarification i live in the east coast of Attica where it rarely goes below 0 (at best once a year)
I have the Ac trying to mentain a temperature of 22C in the living room
The temperature in the rest of the house is at 18C a bit cold but not realy a problem
I spend most of my time in the livingroom
I have also a Dehumidifier to mentain a humidity around 50%
The temperature outside is 15°C so it's probably a bit higher than that inside
But 15°C indoors is pretty cold imo
There are efforts
There are definitely safe neighbourhoods in Athens but you couldn't pay me to go to Omonia or Menidi at night, I like my head exactly where it is
Athens is relatively safe in most areas, as far as stick ups are concerned
Pickpockets are a thing in the centre, but assault is not really an issue in most areas
well in Artemida it's kinda creepy because the road lighting isn't the best and they don't cover everything every part of town but it's pretty safe
How did you convince yourself to go in
We have [Bouzouki] (spelled somth like: "booze" - "ookee") which is, from what I know, of Turkish or Anatolian origin
We also have [Tabouras]
a musical instrument with Byzantine origin and [Baglamas]
[Rebetiko] is a music style that uses Bouzouki and Baglamas
[Here] is a video with many Rebetika (Rebetiko-style songs)
Edit: Fellow Greeks could maybe give you a more detailed answer, since there are also many different types of "national" music worth learning about
We have local traditional musical instruments, for example in northern Greece it’s the klarino, in Crete it’s the Cretan lyra, or the flaouto, etc
Ans because we don’t want to fight each other on whose musical instrument represents the country, we leave it as it is :)
My city, Heraklion of Crete, had been under siege by the Ottomans for 21 years, back when the city was called Candia and was under Venetian rule
It is the second longest siege in the world, after that of Ceuta
The invasion of Crete started in 1645 and the siege of Candia (Heraklion) in 1648 and lasted until 1669 when it ended with Ottoman victory
Many claim it was because of treason that Candia eventually fell, when a Venetian military officer defected to the Ottoman side and revealed to them, the fortifications' weak spots
It took a lot of effort
It wasn't all in one go
The current borders were shaped as much with conquest and re-conquest as with treaties
Most of the expansion, after the initial state had formed, came after the Balkan Wars, that's when Crete became Greek again too
But for others, it took longer than that
For example, the Dodecanese which we got back only after the second World War
I'm going to wear a pin with the flag of Luxembourg and walk around with a sandwich saying "Dat ass hot"
Be polite, honest and open
Enjoy your trip, you're worrying too much
Try new things, get involved, learn a few phrases/words in the locals language if that helps you get familiar with the place, and smile
Not American smile which looks forced and fake but a genuine smile whenever you truly feel like it
There's all kinds of replies along the lines of "Just don't be a dick, relax, be reasonable, use common sense" etc, etc
I really don't think that translates well due to things like cultural relativism and all
So I'll say this; *be observant*. Don't double-check yourself every time and get stressed out, that's not what I mean, but observe peoples' behavior and just try to make your way around the place along those lines
I'm saying this because Europe isn't one big homogeneous landmass, much like the United States
I'd never pretend that advice given to help you move around Greece would apply to moving around Sweden for example
Just keep your eyes and ears open, be receptive, take it all in and enjoy the place
*When in Rome, do as the Romans do* and all that jazz
I'm Greek (duh, hence the flair) and my husband is American
When we first started dating, he he'd get livid with me getting to the date late
I didn't do it on purpose, I wanted to look gorgeous and kept missing the damn busses (I lived 2 hours away from him)
Anyway, he'd go on and on of how awful that was and he even implied once the relationship won't work which I thought he's a drama Queen, but no it's cultural
All that while he was living in Athens
It took me a while to explain to him Greeks don't show up on time and he slowly started seeing the same pattern with other Greeks as well
He is still very punctual, like when he needs to go to an agency or shop or something, but we're living in Greece so he has to wait for the Greeks to arrive late, lol
It doesn't bother him anymore and he now sees how different life here is, he even has managed to relax in general
"If it happens, it happens" attitude
For me, I think the first thing that I noticed, was the obvious distress of him when for example they wouldn't have a product we needed in a certain shop
Any other Greek would just smile and look to another store
My husband would do an obvious eye roll and exhale which me and the people working there would find it rude
I once told him about that, apparently he was doing it without thinking it was even obvious and was quite surprised everyone thought that was rude
He avoids doing that now
He still *hates* waiting in queues (I don't) but ever since we've had kids it has thrown all his schedule all over the place and now lives in a limbo state of going with the -Greek- flow
So basically, Americans like to be punctual and can't be patient
Once they chill they're fine
My husband is American and I swear to God, he yells more than I do
Our house is like a gigantic woofer
If I'd miss the bus, two hours
Obvs I'd text and explain what's happening and not to to wait for me yet at the usual spot
Although he had been living abroad since he was 18, it was the first time he lived in the south and the first time punctuality was a problem since when his Greek friends would be late he didn't really pay much attention as they never had a set time
If they were around, they'd go for a coffee
No, I think it's both
Americans from what I've encountered don't have patience and Greeks are almost always late
We just need to find each other in the middle
I had to take the bus and the station was already far
If I was working in the morning and then had to dress up and run, yeah there would be times I'd miss the bus
When he would come to my town I would always be there already
Yeah we're obviously all brown duh
Yup completely agree
Gosh those Marxists are a lot more capitalist than I thought
we were colonizers but now are colonies are either dead or called italy and we have an awesome relationship with them
biggish for Greece, city here
with that money you can buy property in the outskirts and build a nice house over 100m^2
otherwise an apartment close to 200m^2 or a two-storey house with a small yard
From most of the answers what can someone conclude is that real estate prices have skyrocketed pretty much everywhere in Europe the last 10-20 years
Salaries have not followed not even slightly
How is our generation supposed to afford housing seriously
The average salary in EU-27 is 1,695
00€/month
I haven’t seen/heard, and correct me if I am wrong here please, any single country taking some initiatives to provide affordable housing for newer generations who want to start their lives/families
Has EU budget ever included some money focusing on helping europeans with housing
Has EU parliament ever even discussed about the housing crisis that new generations are dealing with
And if they have, what actions have been taken, where and when
I am very curious to know
4 70-90 s.m apartments, rent them out for 500€ a month, make 2k a month, live comfortably for the rest of my life
Literally ALL of Monastiraki Market, it's filled with tacky tourist shops with overpriced poor quality tourist crap about the Acropolis and the ancient greek world and poorly pressed T-Shirts with cringy Greek stereotypical one liners which are probably gonna fade after a few times in the washing machine, not to mention the huge amount of pick pockets in the square and the narrow roads
When visiting Athens, do yourselves a favour and after visiting the Acropolis dont bother with the tourist shops of Monastiraki, if really you want to buy some souvenirs, just enter one they are all exactly the same anyways, then go eat in one of the tavernas in Monastiraki or something, (except Bairaktaris, somehow this is an unpopular opinion with some Greeks, but their food is crap, and their restaurant is filthy, dont @ me), and then leave
Greece is filled to the brim with islands, you don't have to spend a fortune on Santorini and Mykonos, there are literally thousands of islands just as good as those and you'll pay 1/5th of the price with just a fraction of the tourists
Oh boy, where to start
Since our main industry is tourism (you can imagine how well the pandemic is going for us), it's not a lie to say that most of our country can be viewed as a tourist trap, if you visit the most common places
Start with Cyclades islands
Almost every single one of them
Santorini
Our most overhyped and expensive island, for no apparent reason
It's a sunset, you don't have to pay 80 euros in order to take a photograph
Santorini has ZERO nice beaches
Like, ZERO
Everything is black, due to the volcano
Mykonos island
Also a trementous tourist trap
Everything is extremely expensive for absolute no reason
While the island is beautiful, you spend a minimal amount of 60 euros per day, just to eat and swim
Also
Guys don't go to Psarrou, unless you want to come out with every bacteria known to man
Milos,Serifos,Amorgos etc beautiful places but you have to give your kidney in order to spend 5 days there
Point of view, travel to Dodekanisa(apart from Rhodes) or the Ionian Sea, or my favorite, Crete
Beautiful, colorful places with reasonable prices, nice food and there's everything for everyone
Even better take the tour of Peloponnese by car
GPS works wonders here
Koroni, Methoni, Medieval Mani etc
And please
Don't believe everyone that says, "eat this, it came from my village".
Well actually I went to see the Little Mermaid when i visited
Wasn't disappointed because i wasn't expecting anything monumental but I actually enjoying taking a walk to reach the statue and then trying to step on the rocks to get close for a some funny photos
I share your opinion, Bairaktaris is absurdly trash
Totally για τον πούτσο pita, dry and not tender and the souvlaki was 80% fat and 20% charred fat
I don't think it's an unpopular opinion, deep down we all know it lol
I should add that mykonos and santorini are just tourist traps shaped like islands
If you don't have insanely deep pockets but you still want to visit them do your best to avoid popular restaurants, don't stay overnight and leave without ever looking back because they might charge you for it
This is what I advise to foreign tourists, visit Athens for 2 or 3 days to admire things like the Acropolis, Syntagma, Sounio, hell even Piraeus if you hate looking at nice things, but then just get the fuck out of here, it literally has absolutely nothing else to give you tourism wise, take a bus and go to Delphi, or Meteora, or most of the Peloponnese, or take a ferrie from Piraeus and go to an island, preferably Crete
Athens is only worthwhile in moderation unfortunately
Don't worry, most Greeks would agree with you
If you are interested in history you should visit Athens for a couple of days and then head out to experience the land's diversity
Why do you hate to say it
Try to find a non-Athenian Greek that disagrees with you
THANK YOU, I thought I was going insane, because IN MY DAY, everyone I knew hated Bairaktaris, everyone was saying that Savvas and Thanasis were light years better, that his Tzatziki and Souvlaki were rotten trash
BUT THEN I go abroad for University and suddenly Bairaktaris is the best restaurant on this side of the hemisphere
This is the sort of question that only an american or an english brexiter could make
English is taught in a lot of countries, has a lot of media to practice with and motivate you to practice
It also has quite simple grammar
German-->Greek Auto-translation:
>Wir schreiben nur in Englisch, es sei denn, es steht auf den U-Booten des Landes
Eine automatische Übersetzung würde wahrscheinlich zu seltsamen Ergebnissen führen
Γράφουμε μόνο στα αγγλικά, θα πρέπει να μεγαλώνουν σε υποβρύχια της χώρας. Η αυτόματη μετάφραση θα οδηγούσε πιθανώς σε περίεργα αποτελέσματα.
Greek-->English Auto-translation:
We write only in English, you have to grow up in submarine country
Automatic translation would probably lead to strange findings
Street level is called ΙΣΟΓΕΙΟ (ground floor, literally equal to earth)
Above that we have 1st, 2nd etc ΟΡΟΦΟΣ.  I would say ΟΡΟΦΟΣ has an implication of being above ground level and you would never say ΟΡΟΦΟΣ 0 even if elevators assign it this number
Ground floor (isogeio - ισόγειο - means equal level to the earth/ground), and then first floor above
I think it's only the Americans that consider the ground floor to be a "floor/level". In Greece anything above ground level is considered a floor (orofos - όροφος)
You forgot some like central heating, the concept of citizenship, plumping, Lighthouses, Algebra obviously Feta cheese among many others
You are just flexing at this point
iirc it was among the many things the refugees brought to Greece with the population exchange of 1923
At least that's how we have it where I live
Weren't Cyrill and Method Byzantines
Cause they invented your alphabet based on the Greek one
I also have the feeling that half the Balkan countries claim them for their own
We regard them as Greeks, you as Bulgarians, the Skopjans as "Macedonians", etc
I had to check wikipedia to get my terminology right, what we have around here (I live in a suburb of the Piraeus) is tahini rolls not tahini pie
They usually prepare it during the fast before Easter
I don't know about cities, but there are definitely some regions in Athens and Thessaloniki that are weirdly named
Péfka - Pine trees
Neápoli - New town
Foínikas - Palm tree
Kalamariá - Squid town
Oraiókastro - Nice castle
Peristéri - Pigeon
Sykiés - Fig trees
There's also Kastoriá, which means beaver town
We have many "Saint X" villages
And the moat popular saints get many villages - I can't even remember how many Saint Johns and Saint Georges there are
Same here
We have like 15 places called new town
Yes, thank you
Ketchup ruins most stuff and it's basically only good for fries
People legitimately eat pasta with ketchup, drives me nuts
Well I prefer mayo for fries too but I meant, like, fries are the only food that should ever be acceptably eaten with ketchup
Cons: prosperity, lack ofdevelopment, stagnant mentality, day-to-day racism
Pros: Just look out the window and at the view and you forget everything else, great food, chilled and warm people
Pros:Good Weather,Very good people,nice night life,fking amazing food
Cons:I would've said economy but thats getting better,and you have to serve 9 months in the army
Pros: Good food, lots of sun, landscape diversity (mountains and beaches), most people are kind and outgoing
Cons: Low wages, the orthodox church is too involved with what should only be the state's responsibilities, lots of unemployment, drivers are bad, public transport is bad, people are too loud (well that might not be too bad for some), and our cities have got to be the ugliest and dirtiest I've ever seen
Cons: Cold weather for people who aren’t used to it, racism, homophobia, all very grey and depressing, government, prejudice from the rest of the world
Pros: None
In all seriousness, the nation is beautiful when it’s not grey as hell
Πού μένεις ; Διότι εγώ οταν κοιτάω έξω απο το παράθυρο στη Θεσσαλονίκη και στην Αθήνα βλέπω απλα μαύρες κατεστραμμένες πολυκατοικίες και σκατά δρόμους.
Development είναι θετικό, μάλλον εννοούσες κάτι άλλο.
Seriously I love Bulgaria but every time I'm outside Sofia and Plovdiv , the people seem to really be struggling there
I constantly ask myself why Nordics don't like their climate, only cause I'd love it, but then I remember that we don't like the climate here even though most would love it lmao
Γενικα το εννουσα, οτι οπου και να πας στην Ελλαδα εχεις αυτο το μπλε που δεν το 'χεις πουθενα. Μενω μεταξυ Αθηνας κ Σαντορινης, Αθηνα οκ παω πασσο γενικα, εκτος αν εχεις καλη θεα.

I love rain and moodiness but my dopamine addicted brain doesn't, so I feel you
The Soviet anthem
No, I'm not a communist, it's just awesome
Katyusha, amongst other Russian songs
Every time I hear Russian choirs I get chills even thow I can't understand a word they're singing
And before someone asks, no, I'm not a communist or even remotely associated with the particular ideology
Idk but the one I find more fascinating is the eruption of the [Thera Volcano] on Santorini Island
It happened while the minoan civilization was a thing and it's debated to be the reason for it's downfall
Santorini used to be one island and it literally split into 3 by the explosion and a huge tsunami hit the Aegean
We don't eat Mousaka nearly as much as foreigners think
Most people eat it once or twice a year, on special occasions
Same goes most dishes you'll find in a tavern
What we eat day-to-day isn't nearly as elaborate as dolamades, for example
Also, we rarely drink ouzo
Most people don't actually like it and those who do know it gives you the worst possible hangover
I often hear about the "greek breakfast" of yogurt, honey and nuts
The real greek breakfast is frappe, cigarette and aspirin
It depends form family to family
Mousaka takes a lot of time to prepare so naturally you don't have time or are willing to do it in middle of the week
Dolmades is even more time consuming and hard to make
One could also argue that it is expensive
So it's not that we don't eat them, but then you are working for minimum wage and a gazillion of hours of course the average Greek won't eat Mousaka every week
Personally we always had these kind of foods on Sundays, be it pastichio, Mousaka, Dolmades etc
Because you had time to prepare on Saturday
Oh BTW Mousaka is a seasonal food since you need eggplants to make it (that is to make it good) and fresh eggplants are not available throughout the year
So in my house we will eat e
Pastichio at least once a month but if it's eggplant season, mousaka takes it place
Since they are pretty similar dishes with a few base ingredients being different
Finally it matters a lot where your parents and grandparents come from
I can say that 2/3 of my friends didn't eat nearly as good as I did but I was privileged to have a pontic Greek grandma who was untouchable when it comes to food
Naturally the daughters got a lot from their mother but there are still some foods that grandma was am undisputed master at
Φασολάδα σαν της γιαγιάς μου δεν έχω ξαναφαει.
Yeah, of course every household is different
We only ever made mousaka or pastichio when we had relatives coming home from abroad
Now that I live alone I make those more often (when I have friends over ect)
As for dolamades, I think we only ate them on Sundays during lent, maybe a couple times during the summer and that was it
Yeah
I've worked at a couple taverns and I can attest that people like ordering it more than making it, probably because it has a tendency to turn kitchens into war zones
\-Gifting someone cologne means you'll have a bad fight
\-when someone looks good you have to do a little "ftou ftou"(pretend spitting) so you don't give them the evil eye(mati) but only grandparents and mothers do that these days

Fight me
The hot weather
People think it's awesome because they only stay here for a week as tourists
It's basically impossible to do anything productive from May to September because of the heat
Even walking to the metro station 10 minutes from my house is tiring
Our cities are so ugly, it gets depressing
No sign of nature
Just a dirty bunch of white, graffiti-stained concrete
Aerial views of our cities literally look like wastelands if you squint your eyes
The countryside (especially in the northwest) is far, far more beautiful, but you don't have access to city-life facilities there
Trash trash everywhere
*insert the buzz meme here*
nah it's the most common thing among us balkans
17:00 in Greece and even THAT feels depressing
We don't. Personally, I just die inside and let my body go into autopilot
Honestly that was surprising even for us, hasn't happened before
10-15 during november/early december is unfortunately common though
That's not really normal but the climate is ruined
I saw a documentary about Phoenix recently and I was terrified lol
~Elon musk wants to know your location~
Happy cake day
Shit, I didn't even know
How fitting
I spent almost half my day on Reddit
Thanks
Propably the cyclades Islands, the people are nice (mostly) the environment is pretty, the food is good
Absolutely none
Except, maybe, the city of Nafplio, the first capital of Greece
Umm
Crete, I guess
Everyone seems to love it
I would say that Lidl is the no1 meme in Greece for the last few years
Anything that can be considered cheap in a low quality sense will be memed as being from lidl
*Something* breaks-> *something* is from lidl
I read articles last year that the company will actively try to change that perception and the meme has indeed toned down
But generally it is one of the popular market chains doing very well all those years
We make jokes about it but most people here love it
There's loads of  jokes and memes about its supposed "low" quality products (Lidl brands, like Silvercrest etc
Either way it's always filled with customer's and I've honestly never had any problem with something I've bought from Lidl, value for money 9/10, until now
Bad quality, cheap price
In Greece when people want to say that something is of bad quality or that it's a cheap knock off, they might use the phrase "[something] from Lidl". Make of that what you will
Personally, I don't think they're bad
They have some stuff that are quite good actually
What she/he "should" do is up to her/him
What's with the attitude, are you affiliated with Lidl
Your inferiority complex is showing
Curb it
I should be able to joke about everything I want, but since you are thirsty for a joke about my country then I got something for you:
The quality of our economy is equal to a lidl product quality
Jokes aside lidl is quite popular here and these jokes have actually died down quite a bit, because their products are actually much better than they used to be
I remember getting 2 infrared heaters from them about 5 years ago and they would break down 2-3 times every week
They have improved the reliability of their products a lot since then
I didn't choose to be from Greece, nevertheless Greeks joke about their country a lot
They just don't care about ignorant *jokes from lidl* about Greece like yours
Προς τί η απολογία; Απλά κάνε αναφορά και γραψ' τον/την.
Yes, absolutely
It has always been the norm for girls and boys to hang out together without meaning anything else
Nobody thinks anything of it
It would be very, very odd if someone pointed this out as being weird in my country
Yes, no problem at all
Of course this thing changes when you have to deal with the perception of older people, but yes, it's absolutely logical
Yeah definitely, one of my best friends through elementary and middle school was a girl
Here it's pretty common but it usually ends in one liking the other
Reciprocated or not many times it ruins the friendship
Most of us simply say "yes
" Even in formal calls
Or we say "tell me"
We usually say "παρακαλώ" which translates to either please or you're welcome
It's a polite way of answering the phone instead of saying "hello" ir smth
when I'm in a cheeky mood I answer with words/phrases like "yo
", "talk", "come on"... otherwise a simple "yes
well we gained our independence from the ottomans in 1821,but we have existed for thousands of years
We became independent in 1830 (big thanks to England Russia and France)
But we've been a "nation" for like centuries
Greece as we know it today basically came to be in 1830 (we've switched between being a kingdom and a republic quite some times since then though)
However, the "Hellenic-wide idea", as it was called, which was basically the first ever mention of a Greek nation that would unify all city-states, was first expressed in the 5th century BC by pre-socratic philisopher Gorgias
1830 actually
Having a name for the place is not the same as being a country
All islands have names although the vast majority is part of a larger country

Welp I'm having a cultural shock right now
"Dada" with an emphasis on the a's kind of like saying yes in Slavic languages back to back
Nope, we did not
But the quality of the food there helped me start cooking for myself
So jealous
These are important skills that will set you up for life
Here, if you go back 3 - 4 decades women had housekeeping lessons
All the older women in my family recall it fondly
I wouldn't mind at all
There are many jobs you can do without speaking the local language
No, I don't think we have any such tradition
Not anything I can remember nonetheless
I know a big number of them
My neighbors are mostly grannies and my mother she talks with them sometimes
I live in an outskirt of thessaloniki and im pretty close to like 1-2 of my neighbours who are elders and then i just have some casual talk with the others
I think that, in the cities, most neighbours have a typical "just nod and smile" relationship, but I personally prefer to avoid any kind of contact lol
Shit I also do the last one
Thats the most greek thing ive heard today
Check flag(So lt is spies then)
Regularly an hour to an hour and a half lately
I don't know what it is
Luck
Or rather, lack thereof
I'm really not comfortable around crowds either, which makes it worse
And we're talking about just 17-20 damn km, that's it
I'm not even in some obscure suburb of Athens, it's just an absolute aeon to get where I'm going for some reason
And unless it's later at night, everything's just jam-packed
The only saving grace in all of this is that at least there are railway alternatives to buses, which means Time of Arrival is more consistent
Anything within 4 or even 5km I'll gladly walk, sometimes even more if it means avoiding long wait times and being shoved into a train or bus
One thing that's been some comfort is the fact that I've resorted to taking a book along with me
Yes, I know, an actual book
It's great actually holding a physical one again
Something I've always found rather perplexing is that often the commute exhausts me more than actual work
Like, I know you're technically just sitting or standing, but it feels like sensory overload every time
Obviously what also affects my impression of the commute is the usually lackluster income or type of work that rarely makes it worth the trip
All of the aforementioned things are part of why I've been meaning to move out of the city, or even out of the country altogether
I'd be way more content even attempting to live in a more rural economy with everything that might entail than having to regularly commute through an urban maze

i got a Lazaros in my class too :D
In Greece we have plenty of women named Artemis, it's a dope name
Also some Apollos (Apolonas in greek)  although it's much rarer
Unless I leave the country, I don't see how I could live by myself before late 20s/30s. The reason most people stay with their parents even if they do have a job that pays a less crap wage ( 750-800 euros is considered good for starters ), is that money is barely enough to survive
So most people prefer to keep living with their parents, spending a few hundred for entertainment while saving the rest
If they work to support their family or their wage is lower ( like most young people ), then living on your own is even more unrealistic
Second that
Even young couples need more than 1500-1700 combined to stay together
Also paying for rent, utilities etc, mean you can't save enough money to buy a house anytime, so taking a housing loan is pretty much the only way to get a house aside from inheritance
I would say inheritance is the only way
No sane person would take a housing loan from a bank in Greece where the economy could be destroyed in the next crisis
Not to mention the deposit and interest rates ...
Well yeah, but paying rent all your life is   .. sad
Too bad I only inherit stuff at the countryside
Greece is, in fact, younger than the United States
During WW1 and again during WW2, there was an attempt to create an [Autonomous Aromanian state] within the borders of Greece
Both times it was sponsored by Italy, but both times it failed
The perpetrators, who were Greek citizens, fled to Romania (their considered 'homeland') where they were convicted by Romanian communist courts of fascist collaboration
To this day, Greece still has the largest Aromanian population of any country in the world
What happened to the bucket
Where did they mainly  go
Germany and Austria or directly USA
Hey we did too
Una razza una faccia high five
Similarly, when we gained independence, the country was only 36% the size of the modern-day country
It was just in *1947* that Greece's shape and size was finalized
We still have yet to reach 100 years since the country took its definite form
Not sure what your country is, but according to [this map] it would have been within the borders of Greece only
Cool
Someone was advertising german lessons on the Berlin metro
In greek
Also a life hack video on yt had a greek supermarket in the background
People saying "Opa" really isn't all that common especially in the way it's used/known around the world
Our first king was Otto of Bavaria
His name was Greekified to Othon and he gave his name to the uni he founded (the Othonian University of Athens)
However, he was removed from power in late age and the university of Athens was renamed after an earlier politician who had nothing to do with it (Kapodistrian University of Athens)
Most Greeks have no idea who the real founder was
Ioannis Kapodistrias was the first Governor of Greece after the Liberation from the Ottomans
Kapodistrias was the one who introduced the Greeks to potatoes
When he ordered the first shipment of potatoes,  he ordered that they be offered to anyone interested for free
However Greeks were very skeptical and they didn't take any of it
Therefore Kapodistrias, knowing of the contemporary Greek  attitudes, ordered that the whole shipment of potatoes be unloaded in  public display on the docks of Nafplion, and placed severe-looking  guards guarding it
Soon, rumors circulated that for the potatoes to be  so well guarded they had to be of great importance
People would gather  to look at the so-important potatoes and soon some tried to steal them
The guards had been ordered in advance to turn a blind eye to such  behavior, and soon the potatoes had all been “stolen” and Kapodistrias’  plan to introduce them to Greece had succeeded
We had a larger population as Byzantium (15 million) than now (11 million)
John Capodistrias, who was a statesman, is quite known for bringing the potato to Greece
If you go out on the streets and ask random people who he was, that's what they'll probably tell you
so all we need to solve the climate change is to invade russia
I'm a student of Kapodistrian University and I find it quite disrespectful that we removed his name like that
Without Otto and his family there would have been no university
Lol ok
Fun fact: That wasn't a fact
Pretty sure you didn't
Not the Northern part
Why is it called Cyrillic and not something like Clementic
Dude I mean the Bulgarians in general
Well it was cyrillus and methodious (idk how to spell it) who made it they weren't Bulgarians they started from Bulgaria though
Actually they made it in Bulgaria but first taught it in Russia
Yeah but the Cyrillic alphabet came from that right
OK so it was the glagolitic but the Cyrillic was based on that right
Well I guess that's it but it doesn't if it was made by the two dude whatever though
Brace yourselves Bulgarians I am coming next month
Thanks I'll probably go through there since I am going by car are there any places you recommend in Sofia
OK thanks
Personally, I'm in love with them
I was in Sweden as a student and i could not believe there was a blackjack table in nearly every pub
That's crazy and trust me i know crazy,im greek
Even in the student pub inside the campus
Like
what do you expect to happen
Drunk students will lose all their money
Our ancestors  weren't gay
They said no homo before every interaction
That we were a country in ancient times
The first time any type of "Greece" existed was when we declared independence from the Turks
Before that, Alexander's empire was a unified Greece (without sparta which remained unconquered), but not called that
[Secret schools]
Before the ottomans there only was the roman/byzantine empire and for the brief period of time between these 2, it was once more a few scarcely populated strongholds + stronghold cities, which were cut off from constantinople but not yet conquered
Wouldn't really call any of these greek
That is correct, sparta had already lost all power and influence by that time
It would offer Philippos (Alex's father) nothing, and conquering it would still cost him some soldiers
So he tried to scare them into surrendering by saying something along the lines of "If you don't surrender, I'll burn you to the ground" to which the spartans replied with a kinda famous one word letter, "If". And both went on with their business
Yep, woodstoves are present in some Greek villages
It's a perfect feeling listening to the fire in the woodstove burning while watching the snow
It has become more popular here due to the crisis, but it remains mostly a rural thing, rarely seen in the cities
Well I think the Macedonian empire leans more to good but of course it was an empire how good could it be for the ppl they enslaved
The byzantine empire I'd say neutral
The campaign started before the winter and it ended before the winter started
Yeah but some of the town Alexander conquered have him as a hero and others not
Well I guess so XD I mean I just remembered they did do some good stuff like making the Cyrillic alphabet
I'm not really sure since there are more than one and there's not only one that's very famous
I searched it, but no luck
Giorgos Papandreou for sure, he's the one who put us under the EU supervision with the first agreement which many politicians now agree that they knew that before signing it that it would bring disaster to Greece, but they did sign it
Also I would say Michaloliakos who's the leader of the Golden Dawn a.k.a the Nazi party
And the most hated Greek politicians ever (random order):
Our both dictators
Alexis Tsipras
Nikos Mihaloliakos
Giorgos Papandreou
Kyriakos Velopoulos
And more
Mind the gap please
You mean toasts
Are you talking about something like a toaster grill ? Because literally every night I make a pair of toasts with
We don't really have those toasters that heat up only the bread
tostaki
That's a kind of tough question for Greece given our bad modern reputation, because of the debts
But, I'd say after reading almost all of the comments I have more ideas as to how we contributed to the EU International Community and Europe
**The past:**
Firstly, the Minoans and inventing the first building complexes, tools, artwork, writing systems and trade networks
Of course I'll mention the ancient Greeks influencing the Western culture, languages, architecture, sciences, philosophy, astronomy, mathematics etc
Many Greek inventions are now being used in everyday life
Like *construction* cranes (waterlifting cranes were invented in Ancient Mesopptamia), probably the first Aquedacts[1], [Arcimedes' screw] [Cartography/maps] [gears] [the escapement] [the tumber lock] [plumbing] urban planning, showers, central heating and many more
(got tired and didn't put a link in the last ones)
Ancient Greek and Greek words are used nowadays to describe many of these sciences and terminologies in all sciences
You'd be really impressed by how many of these words are Greek
If interested, you can have a look [here]
Greek was a language in which both Bibles were written
Then the Byzantine Empire, that were basically also Romans, influenced the religion of the region making many neighbouring countries/regions Orthodox Christian by sending apostles
Byzantine scholars and literaries made a great contribution to the preservation and copying of classical manuscripts that enriched the Renaissance in Western Europe
**Modern Greece:**
Many say, that because we were able to counterattack the Italians and push them back, when they attacked us, Germany had to send a big proportion of its military divisions to fight Greece and thus prolonged the attack to Russia, making the Germans attack in the winter and thus helping Russians and the Allies win and buying time for the Russians to further mobilize before the attack
The credit is not to be given only to the Greeks here, since the Brits, New Zealanders and Australians helped *A LOT* during the German attack of Greece
Apart from it, one could say we are the place that took the big hit of the immigrant waves coming in the EU with the goal to go to major European countries like Germany
We are kinda left on our own to deal with a really big number of immigrants, with funding from the EU to build all the concentration camps for them
Germany and some other countries have received many immigrants, with Germany having about 1 million, but the twist here is that these countries naturally take only the educated ones and sometimes unattended kids
We are a country where many Europeans spend their holidays on since we have very cheap prices and idyllic scenery
Many of you probably won't know, but we have the biggest fleet of merchant ships worldwide
Influencing the transportation of goods internationally and in the EU
>According to LLI data, Greeks control more than 18
8% of the world dry bulk fleet and 19
8% of the world tanker fleet
>The Union of Greek Shipowners cites independent data indicating Greek owners account for 53% of all EU-controlled shipping capacity and 51
3% of all tonnage under the various EU member state flags
The dominance is even greater in the dry bulk and tanker sectors

thank you bros
Grazie Italian bros
Ay high five
Wow are you describing Greece rn
Danke mein Deutscher Freund
Thank you for saying that, even though you're a German and could easily want to defend German's position instead of seeing it factually
That's true
And we are really thankful for that mon amis
That's mind-blowing
Here we start taking English in 1st grade and another language in 5th grade (usually German or French, some people do Italian or Spanish)
Edit: Plus Latin in the humanities and Ancient Greek from the 7th grade on
Quite a bit, admittedly
Learning foreign languages is mind altering, and, in my opinion, extremely important in a child's mental development
I agree 100%
Lazaros Christodoulopoulos
I'll say Ephialtes of Trachis
You forgot Alexis Tsipras
the man who sold Macedonia
or is he too "socialist" for your taste my friend
(Φιλικά πάντα και χωρίς να υποστηρίζω όσους ανέφερες ηδη)
Not like he had an option mate
What would you have him do exactly ?
[Police (MAT) violence aimed at unarmed woman] during the 17th of the month which is a national holiday for the [Athens Polytechnic uprising]
Prolly the Koskotas scandal
Greece and turkey are the same
We have it in southern Macedonia too but we call it paprika
I will ask my mother who makes it if she knows the word ajvar
It is really delicious
Pita is the Greek word for burek
Strange to appear in Bosnia
Ministry of Defense here too, I doubt anything suggesting offense exist, I assume in countries where it's not named ministry of defense it would be something like ministry of military or something like that
in Greek it's  Υπουργείο Εθνικής Άμυνας (Ypourgio Ethnikis Amynas) meaning Ministry of National Defense
It is actually called Ministry of National Defence, Υπουργείο Εθνικής Άμυνας (Ipurgio Ethnikis Aminas)
You are right
My mistake
That's interesting, but considering Austria Hungary was an empire "Ministry of Defense" doesn't sound that prestigious
Again, I might be spouting bullshit but that's what makes sense to me
That's really interesting
Cheers for the info
I don't like feta, last souvlaki I had was 6 months ago, not a fan of ouzo and I'm not really a beach person
I'm expecting to be taken behind a barn and shot anytime now
I only mildly enjoy pastichio and the last time I had gyros was about a year ago because it's extremely rare and expensive in Cambridgeshire :(
Ι hate ouzo, it tastes like dish soap mixed with alcohol, and I hate the sun and going to the beach cause I turn into a lobster
A really sweaty lobster
Its people
I'm hella introverted, i don't enjoy going to clubs at all
With night life being **the** way most young greeks "socialize" i'm often the one guy in my friend groups who is always like "nah, i'm good"
it's treason then
I'm not a beach person either
No one in my family can swim because according to my mother "we're mountain people
" I hate the summer and the heat, all I want is rain and cold
They're gonna take away my greek citizenship any day now
Feta is good with gemista and fasolakia, but otherwise it's low in the list of my favourite cheeses
I think there's a huge portion of us that aren't a beach person
Most greeks on reddit probably
during a trip to warsaw I heard it wasn't very catholic originally, isn't that true
I don't have a problem with him keeping it as long as he declares that macedonia is in fact in greece, and not the name of some slav country that speaks bulgarian
That's Cyprus
I dig that actually
But if you want a proper cheese from Greece, Metsovone is the way to go
Ditto on hating summer
I'm expecting the order to turn in my passport any day now
As a person born and raised by the sea my heart weeps for you
In all seriousness though, I get it, it's not really easy to be able to stand both
Extreme cold and heat that is
That could very well be the case
I'm a massive fan of spirits from Votka to Akvavit, to Raki, but Ouzo always tasted like peer pressure
it's mostly what the old people drink honestly, most guys under 30 won't even offer it or recommend it
I'ts good, just nothing special
Most young people don't drink ouzo
I however
Like it a lot as a 21 year old
Always awkward when they ask you how many times you've been to the beach
the answer is ZERO
It will always be zero
Leave me alone
Oh, I'm from a coastal city, I actually do love the sea
I just hate the beach and heat in general
The way I explain it to people usually is "I like to look at it, but from a safe distance" lol
"Do the Chinese"=Κάνω τον Κινέζο (Kano ton Kinezo)
It's when you act oblivious of what's happening around you deliberately
For example, someone asks me an uncomfortable question or a question I would rather not answer and I "do the Chinese" by changing the subject or acting I didn't hear them
same with chinese being incomprehensible and greek being studied in school
People who do not smoke
Police officers get a % for writing tickets so many now it will finally change
[This one] did a pretty good job describing everyday life in various places
You can find all 4 episodes on yt
In Greece instead of celebrating birthdays we mainly celebrate "Name's Days" which is the celebration day of the saint you're named after
So everyone with the same name as you has a party on the same day
So on a given name's day you pop around from party to party hosted by all the people you know of the name being celebrated
For example, if you're name is Eleni, you'll throw a party (on May 21st for Eleni) and your friends will all come visit for a little while, then eventually head off to another Eleni's party
Same
I've always found it weird
I think my opinion is quite controversial but I'm gonna go with Alexander
He was cruel, greedy, narcissistic and delusional
We decided Eastern Thrace and Smyrna wasn't enough, so why not gobble our way to Ankara
EDIT: It didn't go too [well
Join the Eurozone
Big oof
i haven't really seen many other than the standard EU one but i really liked the swiss ones
and personally i hate how boring the [Greek ones] are
Good Internet connection
Aldi
We used to have one but it was closed 10 years ago
I feel you
Germany is very weird in some issues
The only European country where you can actually get fined for downloading torrents
Seems pretty conservative
One of my favorite restaurants i've ever eaten at actually has been a German cuisine restaurant here in Greece (tho it was run by a greek couple who used to live in Germany so not sure if they changed things up at all with their recipes) but i loved it
Don't be too down on German cuisine
this doesn't apply to Greece and more than half of eastern Europe because we don't use the Latin alphabet
but in greek there is ξ and  Ξ (capital) for some reason I write capital Ξ with a line going vertically in the middle
Ƶ  looks coll tho so I might start using it for capital Ζ (the other one is very different, ζ)
without the line but i've come across some very old teachers that use the line
Edit: in our alphabet lowercase z is ζ and capital Z is Ζ so this only applies to capital
Capital Ζ and small ζ. But Ξ can be handwritten as  Ƶ  or with a more vertical line (I still do it when I'm writting fast) but this is NOT how it's taught in school
Small ζ and ξ can get pretty fancy depending the person
Well, a Z with a line in Greek would be misread as a Ξ
Greek is Ζ and ζ.
We also have Ξ ξ which is pronounced as "Ks" and I've seen some people write it like Ƶ but it's rare
To clarify, Ξξ is pronounced ks (x) and Ζζ is pronounced z.
Ƶ is another (uncommon) way to write Ξ in greek (not Z), and I have seen people write the lower case ξ as a ζ with an extra line crossing it horizontaly, much like their capital counterparts
i don't know what Ξ has to do with Z but the only people i've seen write  Ƶ  are people atleast 60 years old
also you have to clarify that Ξ makes a X sound
True, true
Yeah I know, but we're talking about the letter Z saying how X at the start of a word in English becomes a Z doesn't change that
Anyway just a slight observation mate Καληνύχτα
It's a bit uncommon I think
It's a bit more common area in girls I think because sometimes parents make a name out of the two they've given them
Sometimes it works, sometimes the result is extremely pretentious
I'm so jealous of people that have a middle name
Pretty rare i think, I've personally seen it once maybe
drinking sodas instead of water
That's my exact thoughts
Why do a lot of houses have glass doors
And about a dozen glass windows as well
That's like begging to get robbed
I would be so afraid to live in a house like that
I wear shoes indoors
[This Pharmacy in Piraeus looks pretty cool]
I would like to say we have many, but Greece has kind of stayed behind a little apart from a few projects
The reasoning behind this is definitely the economic situation in Greece, bureaucracy, and poor organization which leads to investors foreign and national, being disinterested in investing here
Some Greek modern architecture of Athens (the city I lived in for the biggest part of my life) includes:
* [A pharmacy]  [in Argyroupoli]
* [Another pharmacy] (also added by another Redditor)
* [Rex Theatre] (1937)
* [Hilton Athens Hotel] (1963)
* [Athens Towers] (1971)
* [President Hotel] (1978)
* [Peace and Friendship Stadium] (1983)
* [Athens Concert Hall] (1991)
* [National Museum of Contemporary Art] (2000)
* [National Bank of Greece] (2001)
* [A building of Hellenic General Insurance Company] (2006)
* [Acropolis Museum] (2009)
* [Onassis Cultural Center] (2010)
* [Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center] (2016)
&#x200B;
In Thessaloniki:
* [OTE Tower] (1966)
&#x200B;
Other parts of Greece:
* [Porto Carras Grand Resort] (1973)
I think all pharmacies are made to look like this so that you can easily spot them in an emergency, so they are required to have at least one bright green cross sign
Is that thing around it supposed to be Conway's game of life
Acropolis definitely
I suppose phone salesman (?) Can't think of anything getting hate-hate by all, but I haven't met a single person not finding them annoying af, unless they've blocked their numbers
Another candidate could be the Units for Reinstatement of Order, but I guess that goes into political territory
Oh and the guys checking the metro tickets, although it's not really their fault, just ppl are getting caught having no ticket and blame it on the universe
Also taxi and bus drivers are getting a lot of hate
Crisis ?
I'm going to be honest with you
I don't know what happened, because my daily life didn't get affected
and I also didn't bother searching
Oh I guess something did change: I couldn't use certain credit cards online because of some "Capital Controls" or whatever
I didn't really understand what happened so I'm not really the best person to ask
I thought I was weird for staring down the bus driver to telepathically indicate that I wanna get on, lol
From Czechoslovakia to Yugoslavia
Cool
Serbian for sure
I like how French sound put probably will never get a chance to learn them :/
Definitely German and Spanish
Finnish sounds great as well
same on french
Germany
Haha I have a lgood laugh at them and do them myself, but they can be tiresome at times
Aww ty you neighboors we love you too
And now kith
My parents used to call me malakistíri when I was not behaving
Haha, classic

Duolingo is not good at ***teaching*** you a language, but it's good for learning vocabulary in grouped sections
I haven't looked at Greek though
i used it to learn a bit of dutch & french
its not bad if you work on it every day and treat it seriously
If you want to learn Greek, I can completely vouch for [Language Transfer] It's completely free, they're basically 10-15 minute Soundcloud clips (totalling 4 hours I think) and it teaches you the language naturally, there's basically a volunteer student along with the teacher (Michalis) and he starts off by teaching you a few words, and then prompts the student to construct sentences, and you hear their back and fourth, and throughout the course you learn the grammar of the language and how to think in it
I used language transfer to get a foundation in Italian long ago, and now I'm trying to learn French, and I used their french course to get a foundation too
From what I've heard, their Greek course is also great (and it's complete Greek, not just an introduction)
Also, as an addition to the above-mentioned Language Transfer course, you can start getting a feel for the Greek language by watching Youtube videos, I recommend [Easy Greek] they also add English subtitles to their videos
I heard a few clips, and while they're amazing content-wise, just be aware that Michali's pronunciation is not perfect
He's Cypriot, but from what I know he grew up in Spain I think, and learned greek later in his life, so that explains his accent, so yeah, if you want to perfect your accent just know that his is not 100% native
I myself am also probably going to do the Turkish course sometime in the future, but I want to keep consistent with my french a bit first, have you heard the Turkish course at all from curiosity
Fortune tellers
Stealing money from the citizens and the government, if you are a politician
People who litter make me sick, they're fucking degenerates
I feel you
We don't really have any modern ones just random scary stories
The only one that I can think of is the Night Hag (Μόρα, móra in Greek) that most people believe or say they have experienced but that's basically sleep paralysis
It's an unwritten rule over here, it's not mandatory to bring drinks to a party but everyone will consider you to be a cheapskate  if you don't.
Same here
It actually originally was a reference to slaves, and later on it became "chimney sweeper" and other things, the idea that he is a chimney sweeper exists in the Netherlands too
Ehm no
Our TV channels are playing mostly American, British & Greek movies
Sometimes they play also Spanish, Italian & French movies as well and in some local channels i saw a number of obscure Canadian movies
German movies pretty rarely
Turkish movies used to be popular here in the 80s thanks to the Videoclubs
Stereotypes that Greeks don't work hard and have lots of debt have always annoyed me
I'm all for jokes, but I've found that many northern Europeans seem to think these characteristics are actually true
In reality Greeks work [more hours per week] than almost all other Europeans and have [totally average levels of personal debt] almost exactly the same as a German citizen and less than those from France, Sweeden, the UK, or the Netherlands
Now the stereotypes about us all smoking, saying malakas constantly, and being obsessed with Greek history and being Greek
Now those are all pretty damn true to life
Bah, I hate that bit about surrendering
Awfully ahistorical and insulting
I was considerring to reply, but you covered pretty much everything
Another one that's funny as hell but not true is how we every day eat bougatsa for breakfast and pitogyro with tzatziki for lunch
Every
Single
Day
While the only eating potatoes is obviously BS and famine jokes are shitty to say the least
I will say that during my time in Ireland I was definitely served A LOT of potatoes
At least as someone coming from a country where carbs are mostly in the form of bread, pasta, or rice
I mean, I did eat bougatsa pretty much every day for breakfast my first year of college
But that was not a sustainable way of life
>Another one that's funny as hell but not true is how we every day eat bougatsa for breakfast and pitogyro with tzatziki for lunch
Every

Apparently you've never met me
Exactly
And I guess during this year your dinner was also retsina and every kind of liquor you could get your hands on
Which is also not a sustainable way of life
Never tried it, but it sure looks delicious
Yeah i hear that souvlaki places in the states can be hit or miss a lot
I'm lucky cause were i live there are about 5-6 different ones next to my house and they are all really good
That said i'm not actually consuming as many of them as i used too at some point in my life
depends on how windy it is for me
Low 20°C s if it is windy, light jacket, but if it is not windy anything above 20°C is good enough to wear just a t-shirt
As someone raised in NY and living in Greece right now, just seeing the responses here makes a lot more sense to me
I feel comfortable at 8°C and up, but get so shocked when I see people wearing coats in 20° here
It is definitely man made
You do not need to be a nuclear scientist to see that
Just common sense: If you cover yourself with a blanket you will get warm
As simple as that
Now you get it
I am not talking about saving the planet
This is an other discussion
I am just stating an obvious fact: Global worming is man made
Περικλής (Pericles) - Athenian politician of the 5th century BC, which is nicknamed 'the golden century of Pericles' in our history books
Μέγας Αλέξανδρος (Alexander the Great) - He conquered countries all the way to India before dying at 33 of an unknown disease
There are also a lot of people from the revolution of 1821
Well, we have a few to say the least lol
Alexander the Great, who conquered everything from Egypt to modern Pakistan
Leonidas, with the famous battle of Thermopylae
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle for their work
From more modern times, some warlords of the Greek Revolution like Kolokotronis, Karaiskakis
*Lets see:*
Kolokotronis
Makriyiannis
Botsaris

All of my grandparents died in WWII except one, my Grandpa
He fought in the war, was taken prisoner, escaped and continued to fight
My parents were born during the war my Dad became an orphan, or technically raised by his older sister
My Mom was raised by her aunt
My Mom's Dad is my only Grandpa that I met and he remarried after the war
He also fought in the civil war and lost half his right arm
Oh yea and my other grandparents were part of the population exchange with Turkey
One of my grandparents was born in like 1890
- My late grandfather was in the air force during WWII but he flew only once then he was stationed and German occupation ensued
he was harboring communists during the civil war (although he was right winger)
- The brother of my grandmother was a communist guerrilla and the government, during the civil war and for few years more,  had him on a wanted list for execution
he managed to not get arrested (and executed)
for some time he was hiding at my grandfather's home
- my great grandfather was cavalry captain during WWI/ Balkan wars
his unit was the first to enter Ioannina (a city in northwest Greece) and liberate the city
My ancestors were the first to introduce chocolate in Greece
That's why all the dark chocolates here have their last name, Pavlides
My parents took part in the [student uprising against the military dictatorship in 1973] Both of my grandfathers took part in the [resistance movement against Nazi occupation in the 1940s] My great grandfather took part in the [campaign for Asia Minor from 1919 to 1922] Earlier ancestors of mine have most definitely taken part in other national wars and campaigns since our history for the last 200 years is full of those
My grandfather took part in the resistance movement in Greece during the nazi occupation in ww2
My grandfather fought with the communist rebels against german occupation during WW2 and my grand- grand father fought against the Ottoman empire  , 4 times he was summoned to fight for his country,
Welp
The climate is probably a huge factor
+No olive trees
looool
Europeans need to stop with this shit
If you think there is no racism in Europe, get out your house
I hate this "Europe is a post racial world" attitude some users in this sub seem to have
There is **huge** nationality discrimination in Europe as it is, let alone actual racism
Same
In Greece we say Box instead of Boxing
Greek too
Except for 'footing'.
True, but we don't say 'jogging' either
We pronounce it jaw-kin for some reason
Thanks
I kinda hate it tbh, but I can't change it
The Parliament
Everything unfortunatelly,especially in athens
I'm fairly certain I haven't seen any comments from Greeks because no one knows where to start from, the amount of stuff that's wrong with our education system is overwhelmingly high
Learning ancient Greek is mandatory, you have little to no freedoms, no phones allowed (although many teachers don't enforce that rule, the fact that English is not taught properly but it is still mandatory for pretty much your entire school life and that religious education is a thing for 2 hours every week
The first that come to mind are:
- A lot of stuff need memorization which most students keep doing throughout the year and it isnt really effective
- In religion class the students are supposed to learn about the different religions but in reality they learn only about christianism
- students still gather and do the little christian prayer every morning before classes begin
- Because of the permanent teachers and the lack of evaluatuon many teachers dont do their jobs properly or at all
Which traditional dish of another country's cuisine proved to be a pleasant surprise when you tasted it
I knew nothing of the Irish cuisine before visiting the country, so I had no specific expectations
I sure wasn't expecting to fall in love with Irish fish chowder, especially the one I had at Dingle
Edit: Thank you all for sharing such delicious dishes and making me aware of them
I'm HUNGRY all of the time since yesterday, but it's well worth it
I think that's about as authentic as the experience of Greece can be (although I would change the beer for tsipouro)
First time in Ireland, my husband was getting invited to a party by some locals in the pub, while I was drinking beer and talking about the European economy with another local outside the pub
It's this friendly and easy-going attitude that I encountered in Ireland that made me feel like I was at home
The cucumber in tzatziki is a refreshing touch
It's an integral part, because it contributes to tzatziki's balance (both in terms of taste and texture)
As for Greek salad, you can ask them to skip the cucumber the next time you'll think of ordering it :)
Never had them, but they do look delicious
These are also like little kebabs, right
Never tried it, but I am all for British scones and fish & chips
I have never tasted Georgian cuisine, I'll see if we have a Georgian restaurant here in Athens
Btw, I love spinach
I want a papanasi like NOW
Didn't knew it existed, but now that I've seen photos of it, I don't think I'll be able to forget it
I am accustomed to a stuffed cabbage recipe similar to samarle  - our version is called lahanodolmades
I absolutely love Italian cuisine, but a couple of pasta dishes I had when I was in Rome were too al dente for my taste
Do you also cook your pasta so al dente in Finland
I thought it had to do with how I am accustomed to eat it, that's why I ask
Paella rocks
Goulash was a pleasant surprise for me too, just not in Prague but in Gyor, Hungary
I don't think I've ever tried a soup that I didn't like
It's this homey feeling that a soup creates, which make it impossible not to love it, regardless of what it's made of
I would easily try them
They are already red, I wouldn't want to make them more furious by rejecting them :p
Turkish food is really nice
I have spotted a couple of restaurants in Istanbul through the net, where I specificaly wish to go to experience their culinary delight
I should make a shepherd's pie at home some day
I think I'm going to like it
Not my cup of tea
Do they really serve it for breakfast
Did you also have Alsatian wine with that
Don't know why, but the first thing that I'd wish to try if I ever found myself in Alsace would be the region's wine
Wow, that mix of culinary influences sounds amazing
The sauce in this dish must be very tasty, judging by its ingredients and preparation method
So, basically this is steak tartare from pork
Is that correct
Isn't it risky to eat it
From what I know, pork, unlike beef, really needs to be cooked in order to be safe for eating :/
We had exactly the same pierogi experience in Warsaw :)
Crusty on the outside and creamy inside
I'd definitely try them
I've had my fair share of gyros pita ;) Never had bifana though
Is this different from the goulash soup
I had that once
Wasn't bad at all
Never visited Prague or Czech Republic in general, unfortunately
I'm planning to visit a Czech restaurant in my city, though, to try the cuisine
You say "greasy potato ball", I say slurp
I do not if it is the same thing or at least something similar, but cured herring here is a first class mezze for one to accompany his/her ouzo or tsipouro
Personally, I love it
Go "haring"!
You don't remember how it is called
Made me curious
Melting cheese
Yes please
From all the African cuisines, the Ethiopian one is definitely among the first three that I would like to try
I am surprised at how many fans haggis has :)
I wish I had some Belgian fries right now
I went to Evrytania for the first time before all this covid staff
It's a Greek prefecture totally unspoiled by tourism (I've been told that very few foreign people visit this place, which isn't grand even in terms of domestic tourism), full of stunning natural beauty
I was in awe
Anyway, I met an old man who wanted me to try his chestnut jam, infused with honey
God
I came back with three huge jars, which I never want to let go
Just today I was telling my father how I wish to visit Morocco
He's been to Morocco, and among the things that he remembers from that trip he took 35 years ago is that he couldn't eat anything while he was there
I don't think I'm gonna have that problem
I know of only one town here in Greece where they serve frog legs: Ioannina - never been there
And I was 15 when I visited Paris - there was no way I would eat frog legs back then
So, no frog legs for me, yet
Fresh seafood, I second that
Heavily spiced with paprika
I'm sold
Fan of liver here
Never knew, though, that there is such thing as a liver sausage, wow
If it's not too sour, I think I'd like that
Thank you for this culinary trip
You can have my share of Greek yoghurt any time you wish
The few times that I HAVE to eat it (I never WANT to eat it) I can only make myself do it if I pour a lot of honey on it
That said, I have no problem eating tons of yoghurt-based tzatziki
The dish that striked me more on your list is the French one
Tripes are intestines
I just read a recipe of it and it sounds a rather fatty dish
As for the other four, I could eat any of them anytime
This sounds interesting
What is its texture like
Fluffy or chewy
You made me want to sit at that table with the green beans, the bread, the cheese, and just slowly sip my wine
Parfait
I know that some Greek restaurants abroad even have Greek producers directly send them stuff, so that they can not only cook Greek, but also deliver dishes that have a genuine taste of Greece
I hope someday you'll come visit us :)
I like steamed buns
I believe snails are very tasty in whichever way they are cooked, not having tried the French way though
I haven't been in Germany, but I was reading an article a while ago that the variety of bread in a German bakery would blow your mind
That was an interesting fact for me
These little places, where there are only a couple of people in the kitchen cooking only a few dishes per day and not laying in front of you a miles-long menu I think  are the best
I'm not very fond of sweetbreads, but give me some liver anytime
I've long wished to try some pasteis de nata, I'm sure they must be delicious
Haha, you drew a nice picture there
I'm amazed at how many people love haggis
Not because I do not like it (never tried it), but because I was under the impression it didn't have many fans
I totally agree about Polish pierogi
As for lohikeitto (which I had never heard of till now), I think I'd liked it
Never had any of them, unfortunately :(
Thanks for this
And I totally agree with your last remark
This is definitely one of the most 'weird' dishes I have come across in this thread
Although it shouldn't be, as there are people here in Greece who eat the sheep's head (they mainly make a soup with it), so it doesn't ring far away from home
It's just that I can't even make myself picture a sheep's head on a plate
That said, I'm glad that it was a pleasant experience for you :)
Hahaha
Same here, friend
I could live on soups
It's been 25 years since I went to Paris and I only remember of the croissants I had for breakfast
I don't think that's because everything else was bad (I would remember if that was the case), but probably because I didn't get to try anything memorable
I have only tasted strudel here in Greece (which, of course, I liked)
I guess if I had the chance to experience it your way (breakfast, mountain, tavern, hiking), I would be drooling about it
Wow
I had no idea that you like tacos so much
I just read that you also have taco Fridays
I'm stunned
You should, since you liked it so
Also
Petra <3 (Never been there, but this place calls me like a Siren)
I'm only familiar with Swiss cheeses and fondue, but the rest that you mention doesn't sound bad at all
As for Swiss wine, I didn't know that was a thing :D
It must have been oenomelo (wine with honey)
We look forward to welcoming you again :)
I have enjoyed the food in Belgrade, Serbia and in Dubrovnik, Croatia (oh my, I just remembered that I have had a to-die-for shellfish experience in Mali Ston, Croatia
From my limited experience, I tend to agree with you and I would also like to see more Balkan national restaurants rise to fame
We eat kokoretsi here (sheep's liver, heart and lungs wrapped in intestines)
What's more, I could eat one by myself - I love it
So it's not what's in haggis (although I don't get what oatmeal is doing there), but rather the stomach part and its whole appearance that make me never want to try it
Can a person not be disgusted by intestines, but find a stomach appalling
Apparently, yes
Oh wow
I airbnbed in Ireland and I didn't come across it
I see
Even so, I think I would be hesitant to try it
I am glad, however, that both of you not only tried it, but enjoyed it so much too :)
Noted :)
Could it have been [lamb kleftiko]
Makes sense
Thanks for the insight :)
You should come visit us again then, when you get the chance ;)
Representing Greece here
I prefer the flag of the 1st and 2nd Republic (they are the same ) instead of our current one
Its simple,  easy to remember and to draw, with historical meaning etc
If I was PM I would change the flag in a minute
However there is one symbol that is highly controversial
The phoenix
The phoenix was used since antiquity as a symbol of rebirth in Hellas
It was also highly used in the first days of the republic , as a coat of arms,  state seal, even currency
However the military Junta of 67 used and since then it associated with ultra nationalists and authoritarians
We need to take that symbol back
The word Μαλακα
There's no way someone hasn't heard malaka being said by a Greek in TV or a game
I'm glad I'm not the only one who does that
Oh damn I need to start saying that, whenever I get asked that I just say "Well, what the f do you want me to say, then
Δεν συγκρίνεται το κάτι με το κέλκε σοζ όμως!
Χαχα έτσι είναι αλλά είμαι και μισός Γάλλος οπότε έχω και τα δύο options ;)
Εξιουζέ μουά τότε, έχεις το ηθικό πλεονέκτημα να χρησιμοποιείς και τα δύο!
So uh, we're in the Balkans
Obviously Turkey, they are kinda threatening us on the regular because our EEZ is made to include every single island we took back from them and they don't like that, I can see why
Albania, nationalists on both sides are dumb
FYROM because of the name dispute and different interpretations of history
We've been kinda chill with Bulgaria but we sort of went to war twice in the 1900s I guess
I'm trying to not create any drama lol
They think that ancient Macedonians were Slavs and spoke that Bulgarian like language they speak eight now, even if the Slavs weren't even in the area yet and we have literal writing from Herodotus calling Alexander Greek and how he participated in the Olympics
Yeah though I have no idea when it happened
Yes actually
In fact the prospect of yielding to Turkish interests is called filnandization over here
Távli it's played by almost every Greek
And I think it's called Backgammon in english
Aye Greece too, we really are very much alike at the end of the day
Same here
Not cities actually, but islands, I think this fits here
With some exceptions of course, tourists keep all going to santorini and mykonos, and there are a lot of other great islands which imo are far better, that foreigners don't know about (though there are always foreign tourists too, I'm talking about general knowledge)
It really depends on what you want though, if you just want an international luxurious experience with greek landscapes but lacking the greek culture experience etc
go to mykonos/santorini
But if you want to go to a beautiful island, that has an amazing ambience, is riddled with greek culture and all that sort, go to [Spetses] for example, it's imo one of the best islands but very little know about it
I looked it up on Google trends and basically Patras is a big one with about 250k pop, without being necessarily the most famous
Next biggest that isn't well known is Ioannina with about 160k population
[here is the Google Trends graph comparison of the cities ]
Not British but I know Birmingham from the show Peaky Blinders
I expected it to be a relatively small town as I had never heard of it before
Very surprised to find out it is the second largest city by population in the UK
Sturm has helped Graz with recognition
Also, Ionian islands get so much less love than they should
No one outside of Greece has ever heard of Evvia, even though it's our second-largest island with nearly 200,000 people
Austrooungaria, or sometimes Austro-Oungaria
Αυστροουγγαρία

That we are lazy
We are, but only during the summer
The heat is just something we cannot deal with
I can feel my IQ declining every day from 11 AM to 6 PM
EDIT:We are "lazy" because it is unbearable not only to work during summer, but it is unbearable to even exist, we are in the verge of physical limits
Foreigner approved, I really do miss gyros
Yeah, it's not a laughing matter
Deaths from the heat rise a lot during the summer in Greece
I'm currently in Hannover, and we had like 37 for 3 days straight
People in my workplace just couldn't work, they were laying around , trying to cool themselves and eating ice cream
Imagine having 38-42, high humidity, every day for 3 months
Its unbearable
You just cant function
And it's totally understandable
Last night was awful, I agree, I couldn't sleep up until 12
30 o clock
The truth is I'm going back in Greece in like 1 month so I wont be here for the autumn :(
Even in Crete where they have lots of wind , the temperatures are still like 39+during the summer
I'm from Thessaloniki, northern Greece , and during mid July up until late August the temps are 38+. The wind doesnt really help in my experience
Sony forget that its not only the heat,  but it's only the sun
You can get REALLY sick if you are exposed under the sun for many hours
Having worked on the bars and cafes during the summer, I know that .
I know bro
Always apply sun cream often during the summer and while under the sun, it's literally a life saver !!! But all in all I totally get you
i'm not entirely sure but from what i gather it has been changed 4 times democraticaly (one of them being a very big change) and 2 times by a dictator
Σκίουρος Skíouros (Skée uros)
The most common word is **Σκίουρος (Skíouros)** pronounced [SKI-uu-ros] This is actually the origin of the English word Squirrel
It comes from the roots σκιά ( which means "shade, shadow”) & ουρά (which means “tail”)
There is also the less common word **Βερβερίτσα (Ververítsa)** pronounced Ver-ver-I-tsa (where you roll the r's)
Except for the rolled R I don't think there's anything about these words that would be difficult for non-native speakers
We call it skiouros in greek
And it comes from skiá + ourá (shadow + tail)
Huhh, in Welsh it's squirrel=wiwer
Interesting connection
For some reason I'd never made the connection with ουρά before
Then again it's not a subject you put too much effort into
In some regions the word βερβερίτσα (ververitsa) is used, with its origin being slavic
VERY prominent in Greece, though mostly on senior high school
I don't think I knew anyone that didn't go to private after-school tutoring at least on the last year, when we have our national exams, if they wanted to enter a university
Exactly
During the last year of high school, the amount of information that is included in the curriculum literally cannot fit into a normal school year
So teachers ask students to get extra tutoring to strengthen the knowledge that has been hastily covered in class, but also to cover topics that will never be covered but are still likely to show up in the national exams (they're a big deal)
Some schools, depending on their budget and availability of teachers, offer free classes on some afternoons taught by the same teachers
But often it's only for some key courses and you're meant to find a paid tutor for the rest
I can say that without the afternoon classes and private tutoring I would have had to take the exams a second time around
In Greece we put them in the fridge too
Oh definitely fridge
They're perishable
It's probably the souvlaki-kalamaki debate between Thessaloniki and Athens
I side with Athens on this one
Whether kalamaki should be called "kalamaki" or "souvlaki".
Greek here
Kalamaki (South Greece) vs souvlaki (North Greece)
I draw the line at price
Ryan, Wizz, Vueling etc are cheaper than trains
Only if it's possible to take the train, I obviously can't go from Greece to Sweden by train for example
I have taken the train from London to Paris before though
All other trips I have done have all been by plane
It's a mixed economy, there's literally no country on earth which is a pure free-market economy
If Sweden is ''democratic socialist'' then almost all major countries in the West are democratic socialist because they're all more or less similar
The UK, France, Germany, etc all have large welfare states, public education, health, transportation, etc
This is considered ''socialist'' in the US but it is not
Those feats are standard for liberal democracies everywhere
Honestly, I can't think of anything, it's usually pretty accurate
oh, in central athens you actually always can see the Acropolis
Are we in any Hollywood movies that are made by non-Greeks
Far as I know to them we are a myth
my big fat greek wedding, mamma mia, mediterraneo (not Hollywood), captain corelli's mandolin, Never on Sunday (prolly the best known in Greece)
Good thing I never saw it then
Learned quite young, like 4-5
Had my fair share of injuries the next handful of years though
Take something like the 4th crusade and the Byzantine successor states
If the mix of crusaders, bulgarians, infighting byzantines, turks and the level of intrigue and bloodshed that accompanies them isn't good enough for you, I don't know what is
Early 20th century Macedonia
Something like RDR2 but with Greek and Bulgarian guerilla fighters
Tbh all of byzantine history is better than Game of Thrones
Some nationalists and racists call the turk "Mongols", but it's not really common, it's only used among them
We sometimes call the Turks Uruk Hai :)
In Greece it starts with the prime minister refusing the free entrance of Italian troupes through mainland with the expression "Well, then I think we have a war" (before that we just learn about the beginning of the war and how Greece tried not to get involved at first)
Then it mainly consists of battles and plans from the allies, cruel actions within borders and then the road to Hitler's fall
I am now starting my final year in High-School and until now we have never done a lesson on WWII, maybe we talked about it a little bit with our teacher but it was never required to be taught
All that I know about WWII is by my own research and curiosity
I am from Greece btw
We managed to kick Italy's ass, then the Germans came and helped them but then we helped the Italians when we changed sides
We also have something in our books about throwing shoes at Mussolini
Actually I didn't know it was not a common knowledge that Mussolini started his own "crusade" and on the process joint forces with Hitler or the whole Greek thing up until recently
Also we we're taught that chapter mainly through songs against fascist italy sung by the rebels
That part was briefly mentioned before we went on the biggest events with Germany
I actually believe that they just don't want us (as kids at least) to know about the bad thing our ancestors did
No country ever is just evil or a saint
All of us can be both
Under no circumstances I believe that Greeks we're always the saints and the other the bad guys
But the history books I had during school years mention nothing about the times Greeks did bad things to other people and I know for a fact that they did those things
A saying goes like that 'Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it
' that's why I think it's important to learn about the good and the bad things
So as not to make the same mistakes again
Oh boy
I'd say like roughly around 3000 BC until 1974 AD
&#x200B;
but seriously, nationalist particularly romanticize between 1453 and 1821 (The Turkish occupation)
While the time *was* often quite a bad time for Greeks, it was also often a fine time for Greeks
Nationalists paint it as a constant horror show and use that narrative as an excuse to not like all sorts of minorities and foreigners and so on
1967-1974
### Military dictatorship (1967–1974)
Pretty much everything
But their two favourite are the dictatorship of Metaxas, 30's up until the occupation of Greece by the Nazis ( yeah, the Metaxas didn't really care) and the dictatorship of Colonels, or of Papadopoulos, from the  60's up until the establishment of the Third Greek Republic and todays shitshow
Yea, just like u/FlmSavage said it's not popular at all anymore
I'd say most Greeks recognize it as the nationalistic anger fueled power grab that is was
Perhaps understandable at the time, but not something to aspire to today
You'll occasionally hear older Greeks still be genuinely sad specifically about the failure to reclaim Konstantinoúpoli but more with a patriotic homesick feeling and less in an angry nationalist way
Even the crazy far right nationalists don't talk about it with much seriousness
Dictatorship
Some Greeks (mostly ethnicists) think that Papadopoulos saved the country (which is false) and we wish we had a prime minister like him
Thankfully they are the minority
In some places and in some tavernas in Greece they serve quails, partridge and guinea fowl/hen
We especially eat rooster, and have many dishes that have rooster (yeah technically chicken)
I personally haven't eaten any other type of bird as part of Greek traditional cuisine
I am completely fascinated by norilsk, it is one of the most interesting cities i've ever read about
Yes it's depressing as hell, but can we talk about the temperature there
Like how do these people live there when the average temperature is below -10 °C ?
I mean the lowest temperature i've experienced here in Greece is around 5°C and i thought i was gonna freeze to death lol
I have a heavy Cretan accent
Girls from north Greece love it
It has almost the same effect like when an anglophone girl hears French
But as you can understand there's also a lot of mocking and especially from the Cretans who live in the cities or west Creta because they say that this accent is for villagers
Abroad I've had some mockings but generally people like it
Also nouns like ο/ η αβαρής, το αβερές
Guess I need to come to France for my next internship now  in Greece it really depends, many will give you at least school credit but in the USA, most internships are unpaid
Slave labor if you ask me
One posting was a 6 month contract of 40 hours per week (and you needed to be "flexible" with your work schedule) and had no benefits (so you pay for transportation, private health insurance which is hundreds per month, etc
This was for the UN
I'm not sure about the stuff you specifically requested but my sister moved to Germany while pregnant and when the kid was born my sister and her husband have been getting child care subsidy (I have no idea if this is the correct term I basically put the Greek term in Google Translate) from Germany even if they both have Greek citizenship and my sister barely speaks English let alone German (her husband speaks both)
impressive
to be honest the only thing I loved about Manhattan
While I mostly like NYC (the diversity and vibrancy of the city are amazing), I thought the subway system could have been more user-friendly, plus it needs an overhaul
I wasn’t too impressed with the skyscrapers because they weren’t a novelty, although Times Square is a must-see, at least once
Would happily go back as a tourist
The popular series "Friends" is translated as Φιλαράκια or "The buddies" in Greek instead of just "friends".
Star Trek: Discovery is called "Σταρ Τρεκ: Ντισκάβερι" in Greek, which is not a translation of the English title into Greek
If you read the Greek title, it's sounds the same with the English title without making sense in Greek
Another one I found about is "The Haunting of Bly Manor"
"Οι δαίμωνες της Επαυλης Μπλάι" or "The demons of Bly Manor".
Alvin and the Chipmunks is translated as "Alvin and his company" (meaning the other squirrels), "Ο Άλβιν και η παρέα του".
Mission Impossible - > "Επικίνδυνη Αποστόλη" "Dangerous Mission"
Die Hard - > "Πολύ σκληρός για να πεθάνει", "Too tough to die"
Get out - > "Τρέξε", meaning "run"
Manchester by the sea is translated to "One city near the sea", I guess we hate Manchester or smth
People broke into my house 3 times
The problem with having border line no police whatsoever outside of Athens
Athens has the most crime by far, that is why they have like 85% of the police
So bad luck I guess then, as Athens is not under control

That one was unironically my top song on Spotify for 3 months straight earlier this year

I don't think you need a car to get around Athens
Actually, it's a nightmare taking a car down town and you will probably and up stuck in traffic and you'll park two miles away from where you need to go
Public transport might be pain on the bottom but still better than driving
Athens/Piraeus here, absolutely no necessity
Generally no, and I don't live at the centre of Athens
Metro is ok for me, it helps me avoid the traffic
Metro is generally much better than taking the car when there's traffic
Buses are terrible though, you can't depend on them to be on time
>What are some of your ~~weird~~ laws that are still technically in effect but nobody's gonna bother enforcing them
p much all of them
High Heels and other shoes that pose a danger to historical sites are illegal
If you're going to visit the Parthenon, make sure to not wear high heels
as for "nobody's gonna bother enforcing them". thats our whole legal system
I may or may not be kind of biased here, but if you count Greece as a Balkan country, then probably Athens because of the importance in history I guess
If you mean today, I would not know how to rank or check for "importance".
No Athens = No democracy and Nice architecture
I'll leave this here
If we count as balkan countries, I also agree that both are important, considering the common history, and the huge parts of it which were the byzantine and ottoman times
Though greece is maybe a touch more rich in history if you go further back I guess
But I also am not sure what op means by important, like if they mean by political importance rn or the historical aspect
I live a 100 metres from Plato's academy in Athens, all the buildings in the area took forever to be built because they had to bring in archaeologists to assess if the artefacts that are found should be buried again or relocated, but it's not like this everywhere in Athens
In Greece too
We’ve been struggling to build a metro line of a few kilometres in Thessaloniki because of this situation
Are you high on drugs mate
Seriously
I don’t think it serves any kind of purpose to have expansionist or revisionist views about sovereignty
It promotes nationalism and racism
Of course many Greeks think that getting back Constantinople would be the most important thing but I don’t think that sacrificing our current borders or sovereignty would be really smart
In the Greco-Turkish war we had initially won back some of our lands and had expanded our state but we wanted too much and went in too far, spread our forces around and actually lost even what we had won
We have a saying in our language: whoever wants the many, loses the few
EDIT: Also wanted to say that’s why I find that Bulgarian guy’s post a little bit racist
Thessaloniki was Greek hundreds of years before it was captured by Bulgaria
Actually there is a big amount of people not paying at all, due to the service being extremely bad, but anyway you can buy paper tickets from small convenience stores, the transport company's ticket offices (at the main bus terminals) or buy a ticket (not all variants available) from an automatic machine inside the bus (doesn't give change) or from the driver - depending on the line (OASTH, Thessaloniki Greece)
Or of course you can buy a monthly pass 10 days before or after the 1st of a month
Even though, after a lot of years, we can finally pay with our CC, we can only buy them in train stations, or designated bus stations
You can't just ride a bus and buy a ticket inside
Less limiting for us, too limiting for tourists; I've helped some navigate the city when I was studying downtown
It's τυρί (tyrí) as well in Greek which means cheese, but I think it more makes you smile for been a totally random thing to say when taking a photograph, rather than making you show teeth by the way it's pronounced

In Greece the major clubs are multi-sport clubs so there can be incidents in any sport
In Greece fans get violent over Basketball, Volleyball, Handball and Waterpolo too
Ultras in Greece turn violent regardless of sport or class
My team had a U-15 basketball game against Olympiacos cancelled because things got chippy and the officiating was questionable, so a bunch of ultras came out of nowhere, threw flares and some of them stormed the court and started beating the referee and chasing the players
We needed police escort to leave the locker room
Basketball, polo, volleyball
We could even get violent over tennis, if we were interested enough for it
It's quite popular but it is not anywhere close to football in popularity

Ehm, excuse me sir

You need someone who knows how to cook meat properly /s
I mean, if **we** are not cooking i'd want Italy to cook
Nah
Although (as a history lover) I was aware of it, the fact that we had a brutal civil war in the late 40s was never even mentioned at our school
Possibly because it has probably never ended
People still get very defensive/emotional/mad when you state something about it and feelings run high even when you talk facts
I didn't know my region was a part of the Republic of Venice, then a part of the French Republic, then an autonomous Republic under nominal Ottoman suzerainty and Russian protection (essentially a Russian protectorate), then a part of the First French Empire and after that a British amical protectorate called the "United States of the Ionian Islands".
My region is not really mentioned in our textbooks so before reading about it on the internet, I only knew that we had a some sort of closer relationship with Italy, which is kind of vague and inaccurate
Once I started reading, I started appreciating my hometown a lot more because it made me pay more attention to certain things that I used to just overlook
My region is not the only one with an interesting past though
There's other places like Crete, Rhodes, Thessaloniki and the Peloponnese, which I find fascinating, but we don't learn a lot about their past either
I guess I just wish we would learn more about what happened after the collapse of the Eastern Roman Empire
I'm not saying we should know every little detail, but it would be nice to have a general idea of what was going in different parts of Greece during that time
You're right
But at that time period they were changing hands all the time and they weren't under the same kingdom/empire if I remember correctly
The Ionian Islands became a separate "block" (can't think of a better word to describe it) only after they came under the control of Venice
But anyway, yeah, most of them were part of the Kingdom of Sicily for some time
I didn't mention it because the timeline would become much more complicated and because Sicily didn't have much of an impact on the islands as far as I know
i would love a greek skam remake, since it has been done in many other european countries and i think greece needs a tv show that deals with bullying, sexual assault, coming to terms with homosexuality, mental illness and racism
but it’s greece and we’d probably fuck it up so maybe it’s for the best
Oh I'd absolutely love this
Skam (when done well) just offers itself for some great commentary on the society it concerns, while bringing to light some very interesting issues teenagers face . Considering how diverse life in each European country can be, I think that it would be great to have more "Skams" that retain the main ideas while deviating from the clear cut plot progression of the original show
Great movie, but has many inaccuracies/lies, as reported by many of the people featured in the book
yeah it is kind of similar especially with the seasons that are centered around different characters like skins did with different episodes
but i think skins was a lot more dark
An hour has passed
It's ongoing actually
A sailing Olympic athlete, Sophia Bekatorou, came public about being sexually abused by an official of the Hellenic Sailing Federation in 1998

not a pop aficionado but I devour music, so
when I was a teen I was into garage punk and I couldn't care less about lyrics, just the one chords and the screams were enough to get me going
as I was honing my english skills I noticed that 90% of the lyrics is about girls who betray guys and stuff like that
I instantly became indifferent, I could not hear another song about the girl that left me and that I'm all that you need and whatev
but at the same time I learned to appreciate the lyrics of psychedelic music
also as a kid I was listening to "vamos a la playa" and I was thinking what a happy song but then I realised it was about a nuclear bomb exploding and everything becoming radioactive
Barbie girl has never been the same
I don't pay much attention to lyrics, the song has to be really offensive to stop listening to it
I could finally sing along and not make incoherent noises ! Though I was 14 when I got my certificate
I don't know nowadays but back in the 90's it was still a thing
And it was not as pc as it would be now, plus the ages would be realistically from preteens to teens which gave you a new perspective on everything, true eye opener
I went to a mountain summer camp, bonfires and all but I knew of very well developed summer camps next to beaches
They still exist but my kids are too young atm to send them there so I don't know how popular they are now
Yes
Althought i've never been to one, most of my friends had fantastic experiences
Apart from private owned summer camps,there are also public camps
They exist and have always been fairly popular
They still exist and are very popular too
Usually beach camps /sports camps
Kids stay there for 11, 15 or 22 days or more depending on what they want, but those are the standard packages
Food is provided, they sleep in little bungalows and they do fun activities all day
I haven't been on reddit for long, but I visit this subreddit daily

Believe it or not capital punishment for all crimes in Greece,was officially abolished in 2004
But it had gradually stopped to be in effect since 1972,where the last person executed had burned his ex wife and two children alive
Since 1975, death penalty was still given to prisoners for high treason,but in reality it meant life in prison
In 2013, the nightmare nazi political party Golden Dawn,tried to suggest that we should re-establish it,but of course nothing was even discussed in parliament
From what I know,there weren't any protests or any other forms of public unrest in order to abolish the death penalty
I am sure that there where voices that were against it but nothing extreme
Its just stopped to be used
Pretty sure re establishing the death penalty is one of Greek solution's commandments as well lol
no unfortunately we have a lot of closed minded people, truth be said it is from bad experiences from some of them but generalising and dehumanizing all of them needs to stop
I'd say it mostly has to do with your education/status/family orientation
An educated (or at least someone with any interest in education, say a student), family oriented person will likely integrate just fine here
People that consistently refuse to integrate in Greek life is what we don't like
Carry your cultural background with pride with you but don't spit on the ground you're living in, be open, be honest, make friends
If you have or wish to have a good education, or/and you want to work and you have a family to take care of, shows you're a grounded individual with hopes and fears like everyone else
I've had all kinds of friends, some were foreigners
Some fit well here (many Albanian kids do), others don't. I had a friend once that was half black, and another friend (we were all close from elementary to high school) one day started a rant about specifically black guys selling cd's (it was the 90s, I'm old), we rolled our eyes and started looking at him "dude
", he turned around and apologised to her "I swear I *forgot* you're even black
I'm so sorry I wasn't thinking".
It is a day off cause it was Easter yesterday(Easter here is as big as Christmas)
Tomorrow will be a day off cause of May 1st
Also, a bit jokingly, I believe anyone who can, will take the rest of the week off cause bars and restaurants open today after a 6 month lockdown
In Greece the 1st of May got transferred to tomorrow (Tuesday, 4th of May) because the orthodox Easter was yesterday and today is the 2nd day, so they changed it to a day that is not "holy" (does that make sense
Normally, I think it doesn't matter whether or not the 1st of May falls on a weekend day here in Greece
Well in orthodox countries it is the second day of Easter so in a lot of countries its a holiday and the workers holiday gets postponed another day on 5he tuesday
Yes, Greece is an orthodox country
The only real easter :p
Yes, both Greek state and Greek church follow the Gregorian calendar, except for Easter (and of course all the other religious dates that are related to Easter) which follows the Julian calendar
Once Everyday
I have long hair, I work out, if I don't shower afterwards I will be captain stench and my hair will look like a mirror with all the grease reflecting the light
Besides that, by Greek standards if you don't bathe daily you will seem like a weirdo, there are people who even wash themselves twice a day
Hygiene is very important here
i shower daily and i take an actual bath maybe once every couple of months
Same here, although in the summer I usually shower more than once depending on if I get out of the house/air-conditioning during the daytime
I also found it was critically important during my army service, we used to shower like 3-4 times a day
Constantine the Great  did lots of stuff for my country and religion
Everyone living in Athens is allowed to look down to every other city since we're living un the biggest, history richest city, in which we have a metro unlike other cities - **Looking at you, Thessaloniki** - and can brag about it
We also have the proper name for Souvlaki
Fyi:
Thessaloniki is the biggest "rival" of Athens and 2nd biggest city of the country
Athens(664,046) > Thessaloniki(354,290) > Patras(168,034)
In the 1900s the most of the Greek population moved to Athens and Thessaloniki but in recent years they've started going back smaller towns and cities, the population of Athens and Thessaloniki has been dropping in recent years while the population of Patras and Heraklion along with other cities has been rising
>Athens(664,046)
That's just the municipality
What Greeks would consider to be "Athens" is closer to 3 million people and dominates the political, social, cultural and economic life of the country
Yeah I know but the same goes for the other cities I mentioned I think
Does that falsify what I said above
I I'm not sure that's why I'm asking
No your description is true but I think the population figures are misleading
No one would say Athens is only 664,00 people or that Thessaloniki is 354,000
It would be moree accurate to say Athens (3 million), Thessaloniki (800,000) and Patras (210,000)
Yeah but by Googling only the numbers above came up, so u figured instead of looking into it more, these numbers give my point across either way

There are a lot of solid metal bands in Greece, but since you emphasized on wanting distinctive elements about the country there is only one choice
VIC are a really unique band because they combine metal sound with greek folk instruments
The lyrics are also mostly inspired by folk music
Most of their songs are in greek, so i would suggest that you listen to those ones first and then move on to the english ones, because you'll get a more accurate idea of their style
Their live performances are also really good
I see the others suggested you VIC for Greece
I think it fits very nicely to your criteria, they are awesome
To spoil you for choice, here is an equally awesome one: [Κραυγή - Ψαραντώνης/Μάριος Λουπάσης] [Psarantonis] is a chapter on his own, his voice is timeless, like the primordial mountains
He plays the cretan cousin of *kemençe*, which might be interesting for you
Also in case you are eventually missing any countries, there are some [incredible lists] over at r/IndigenousMetal that might help you
I would love to see your playlist when its ready
Came here to say this, this band is gold ;)

I haven't really researched the matter but the gust of it is
Members of the fascist party Golden Dawn murdered someone a few years ago and during 2020 they finally found the people who did it and also found that they were instructed by the leader of the Fascist party
They party was deemed a terrorist organization and it's members were put in jail, after this incident the prisoners of Korydalos raised a menacing banner saying ["welcome kids"] basically being the Greek version of "well well well who do we have here"
the (court-martial) Court of the six
(note: although it was named court of the six 8 people were on the court but only six got executed) the six were people who thought to be responsible for the Asian minor disaster
I remember hearing in the news that they were deemed a terrorist organization but that's just a matter of definition I guess
As I said I didn't do any research and just said what I remember thanks for clearing that up also I didn't know the photo was photoshopped thanks for that too(also the link doesn't work for me)
Yup
Greeks can check and tell me if I need to change anything
Σε ευχαριστώ (I thank you)
Σας ευχαριστώ (I thank You, pl)
Σας ευχαριστούμε (We thank you/You)
yes, and it also changes depending on wether you are thanking one or more people
Ευχαριστώ = [I] thank you
Ευχαριστούμε = [We] thank you
Of course
It's not the same word for both singular and plural
In the grades equivalent to 7th, 8th and 9th Grade (1st second and third of Gymnasion), in Ancient Greek literature we are taught the works of Homer (Odyssey, Iliad) and the tragic poet Euripides (Helen)
There is also modern Greek literature in which we learn different stories, poems and fairytales of modern and early modern Greek authors about society, war, family, history but also folk literature
When I was I School we had two types of mandatory literature, which I think they still have
We read the Classics, like Homer, Sophocles, Euripides both in Ancient and Modern Greek
Then we had modern Greeks with a mixture of poetry and stories like Sepheris, Elytis, Papadiamantis etc
For both classes, we wrote essays etc
In Greece we've read: [Odyssey] [Iliad] [Helen]
In Switzerland we've read:
[Götz von Berlichingen] Jugend ohne Gott
and other ones that I can't remember
Well it really depends on the text and the age of it but Homeric texts are definitely too old to understand the full text so that’s why we do them in modern Greek though keeping many ancient words
Keep in mind though we learn Ancient Greek as a separate lesson from modern Greek in Gymnasion and read some smaller literary texts in full Classical Ancient Greek
The vast majority don't really know it other than phrases and some words
For the most part it's just a school subject everyone hates lol
Pretty common, I'd go so far as to say a respectable percentage of Greek males will go through a long hair phase at some point
On a completely urelated note, Greece has the highest number of metal bands per capita outside scandinavia
98% of the time it's only metal heads that have long hair and they aren't too rare
also men that are 40+ years old that just put them in a ponytail
Uncommon, if you're clean shaven and young, you will probably get called Miss a few times by older folk :D.
Other than that, it's not 'bad' to have long hair, most people don't care at all but older generations MIGHT think you're a degenerate or something
I mean, as most point out, I think it's quite usual among metalheads, and I've seen some non-metalheads maintaining a man bun as well, but overall, I don't think it's that common
Έχω 10 στενούς φίλους, κυριολεκτικά κανένας δεν έχει μακριά μαλλιά εκτός από μένα. Δε ξέρω που τους βλέπεις όλους αυτούς. 10% ΜΑΞ σου λέω εγώ έχει μακριά μαλλιά.
Literally translated: Horse of the Mother of Jesus*
*Mother of Jesus is a single word in Greek
[Zorbas Dance] think that's what it's called)
Also ["Το Ζεϊμπέκικο της Ευδοκίας"]
I had no idea that Daft punk is from France wow
Also "despacito"
Well my bad
I came to Sweden 2 months ago, and I told my group of friends in English (I'm in Erasmus right now)
I come back from Sweden and everyone is asking how Switzerland was like
we help them to grow their fortunes and their descendants to control much of social and financial life in the the country
This is a very interesting case in Greece, because there never really were any mass trials for Nazi collaborators
During Axis occupied Greece, many Greek communists fought against the Nazis and right wing Greeks too, which led to some right wing Greek groups (especially in the southern Peloponnese and cities like Thessaloniki) siding with the Nazis, and even rebel groups that fought for them, as well as official groups (like the security Battalions, who were Greek evzone unites directly controlled by the Third Reich, basically the Greek SS)
After the Nazis left, the communists were a great threat to the Greek Monarchist state, so there was a brutal civil war between fascists/Monarchists and Republicans against mostly communists and other leftists
It was not in the in interest of the Greek state to get rid of Nazi collaborators, since they were helping them fight the communists
This led to unpunished Greek Nazi collaboration, and many Greek Nazi sympathizers
"Punished" is a joke here
Some Nazi collaborators may have been slain by the resistance factions during ww2 but as Greece shifted immediately to the civil war - the first of cold war proxy wars- those nazi collaborators were assimilated by the right wing resistance army (heavily supported by Britain) in the war against the communist resistance army (mildy supported by communist balkan states)
So nazi collaborators became backbones of the greek right-wing state for decades
Even today you get some fascist or closeted fascist  politicians whose fathers happened to be the traitors who were prominent supporters of the military junta (1967-1974) and their grandfathers happened to be the traitors who collaborated with the nazis
"In France or Italy, if you fought the Nazis, you were respected in society after the war, regardless of ideology
In Greece, you found yourself fighting – or imprisoned and tortured by – the people who had collaborated with the Nazis, on British orders
>The head of MI5 reported in 1940 that “in the personality and  experience of Sir Charles Wickham, the fighting services have at their  elbow a most valuable friend and counsellor”. When the intelligence  services needed to integrate the Greek Security Battalions – the Third  Reich’s “Special Constabulary” – into a new police force, they had found  their man
>Greek academics vary in their views on how directly  responsible Wickham was in establishing the camps and staffing them with  the torturers
Panourgia finds the camp on Giaros – an island which  even the Roman Emperor Tiberius decreed unfit for prisoners – to have  been Wickham’s own direct initiative
Gerolymatos, meanwhile, says: “The  Greeks didn’t need the British to help them set up camps
It had been  done before, under Metaxas
” Papers at Kew show British police serving  under Wickham to be regularly present in the camps
>Gerolymatos  adds: “The British – and that means Wickham – knew who these people  were
And that’s what makes it so frightening
They were the people who  had been in the torture chambers during occupation, pulling out the  fingernails and applying thumbscrews
” By September 1947, the year the  Communist Party was outlawed, 19,620 leftists were held in Greek camps  and prisons, 12,000 of them in Makronissos, with a further 39,948 exiled  internally or in British camps across the Middle East
There exist many  terrifying accounts of torture, murder and sadism in the Greek  concentration camps – one of the outrageous atrocities in postwar  Europe
Polymeris Volgis of New York University describes how a system  of repentance was introduced as though by a “latter-day secular  Inquisition”, with confessions extracted through “endless and violent  degradation”.
>Women detainees would have their children taken away  until they confessed to being “Bulgarians” and “whores”. The repentance  system led Makronissos to be seen as a “school” and “National  University” for those now convinced that “Our life belongs to Mother  Greece,’ in which converts were visited by the king and queen, ministers  and foreign officials
“The idea”, says Patríkios, who never repented,  “was to reform and create patriots who would serve the homeland
>Minors  in the Kifissa prison were beaten with wires and socks filled with  concrete
“On the boys’ chests, they sewed name tags”, writes Voglis,  “with Slavic endings added to the names; many boys were raped”. A female  prisoner was forced, after a severe beating, to stand in the square of  Kastoria holding the severed heads of her uncle and brother-in-law
One  detainee at Patras prison in May 1945 writes simply this: “They beat me  furiously on the soles of my feet until I lost my sight
I lost the  world
>Nowhere else in newly liberated Europe were Nazi sympathisers enabled  to penetrate the state structure – the army, security forces, judiciary  – so effectively
The resurgence of neo-fascism in the form of  present-day far-right party [Golden Dawn]  has direct links to the failure to purge the state of right-wing  extremists; many of Golden Dawn’s supporters are descendants of  Battalionists, as were the “The Colonels” who seized power in 1967
>“The whole thing”, spits Dr Gerolymatos, “was for nothing
None of  this need have happened, and the British crime was to legitimise people  whose record under occupation by the Third Reich put them beyond  legitimacy
It happened because Churchill believed he had to bring back  the Greek king
And the last thing the Greek people wanted or needed was  the return of a de-frocked monarchy backed by Nazi collaborators
But  that is what the British imposed, and it has scarred Greece ever since
>“All  those collaborators went into the system,” says Manilos Glezos
“Into  the government mechanism – during and after the civil war, and their  sons went into the military junta
The deposits remain, like malignant  cells in the system
Although we liberated Greece, the Nazi  collaborators won the war, thanks to the British
And the deposits  remain, like bacilli in the system
> We did give money to Greece
...to fund the civil war
None cause there aren't any near me but I really want to
I have visited quite a few ancient temples though
And a small underwater prehistoric village thing
Not many castles really, I have visited one in Heidelberg though
Since I'm Greek I've obviously visited loads of ancient temples and ruins, and some in Italy too
Like 2, one in Germany and one in the UK
Greece doesn't really have castles more like giant walled cities, if that counts then like 10
3 or 4 maybe
Does Kastra in Thessaloniki count
I don't think it would since it's just ruins and walls, but if it does then one
Well by Greek standards it probably is
The one I want to visit the most is Spinalonga but I haven't been to Crete in years
Sometimes they pay me my salary
Employment Benef
What
Pft, check this guy out with his salary
You mad bro
Bro, I can't even afford to be mad
^^^sobs
The shortest I could think of is [έπαινοι] lit
praise, credit, award (_in education_)
Now I have to find another one xD
That only has 3 vowels ε, οι and α.
our language is kind of a cheat though, cause that basically has 2 "e" and 1 "i"
Edit: "ενδυναμώνουν" (endinamonun) for example has all e,i,a,o,u sounds, just many consonants in between (...for Greek standards)
That's true lol
Unusual answer but the Persian wars (500BC) was the first time the Hellenic people fought together against a common threat
Oof, this is hard, but I would not go with the obvious War of Independence in 1821 and rather choose the 1922 "Asia Minor Disaster" which concluded the Greco-Turkish war
Pontus, Cappadocia, Smyrna and of course Constantinople (now Istanbul) were places where Greeks had been living in for millenia and they were suddenly uprooted violently after the army lost the zone of Smyrna
So on the one hand you have the erasing of thousands of years of greek history in Anatolia
On the other hand, the arriving refugees were proud and hard-working people that not only strengthened our position in Macedonia, but helped create a somewhat better economic environment
Overall this compacted the nation into the new borders
Definitely a really defining period
Our war of independence, probably, but I think many people feel more connected to ww2 because it's more recent
I'd actually agree with you on that
The arrival of the refugees really shook the foundations of modern Greece, causing it to change irrevocably to what it is today
Arts were completely redefined (music, poetry, literature, theater) with many of the sounds we still hear today stem from the creations of the refugees
I don't think I need to mention people like Seferis, Venezis, Dido Sotiriou, Kastoriades etc
The economy was massively affected as well, with so many new people coming in, women entering the workforce, the distribution of land and the revitalization of more remote areas, the introduction of new and improved farming methods etc
Plus many welfare projects were put into place for the first time then, while there was also an increase in infrastructure related projects, again, to accommodate this massive influx of refugees
Politics were also impacted, as you had this new group of people to cater to now, and a group of people that included many highly educated folks at that
There's so much more to say about the Refugee Crisis of 1923 and onward, and I think that Greece would not be the same country it is today without these people
I myself wouldn't exist so
From whom (genuinely asking, Turkey has never been occupied by foreign forces, to my knowledge)
Unless you're referring to the campaigns after ww1
Olives, they fucking stink
Also, really any type of fish except for tuna
Going to seafood-based taverns in the summer really sucks
My uncle once tried a sugar-potato (krumplicukor) which is essentially potato with sugar
It was 10 years ago and he still claims it to be the most disgusting thing he has ever had
>there is a tendency to stereotype every European cuisine other than France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal as horrendous and bland
That's dumb as fuck
My ex is from Denmark and lemme tell ya you guys have some really tasty looking dishes up there that I'd love to try once I visit
You hurt me deeply, just so you know
I dont like olives either
Neither do I like eggplant so there goes mousakas
I enjoy fish though
Wait till I tell you that I can't fucking stand the smell of feta either
I only eat it with pasta
Enough of a reason for all Italians and Greeks to publicly execute me
Let's find out
Yep
Can't stand any kind of olives
Yeah ntolmádes are greek (ntolmás is the singular form)
I'm not really a fan of those either
Oh there's another one
I don't like mousakas at all, because of the eggplant
If it was only the other ingredients then it would be divinely tasty, but nah
I love that combination as well, but no olives please
Just olive oil
High five my dude
How do people eat this shit
Please turn yourself in at the nearest police station for deportation
The greek one, didn't know there was a danish feta
What's that like
Don't worry I'll willingly leave once I'm financially stable enough for that
Spoken like a true Greek
That's definitely interesting as fuck
I've noticed that we got the same cuisine in all of the Balkan countries while calling the dishes different names
Dry feta is the only variant I can stand
That sounds like something I wouldn't be a fan of either
Yep
Is it
Is it
Haven't heard of it
Probably the Acropolis museum and the Goulandris museum, the National Archaeological museum as well, and I guess Lalaounis jewellery museum and Vorres laographical museum
At least for Athens, and its probably not a complete list
For other cities, someone else might know better
There are 9 KFC stores all over Greece, 8 of them in Athens
To put things into perspective there are only 21 McDonald's stores as well
Foreign fast food chains aren't popular at all here
Locals prefer either Greek chains or the neighbourhood fast food joint
The same applies with every brand, like Domino's and Pizza Hut
Burger King doesn't have a single store even
Neither KFC nor McDonalds are very popular in Greece and this is probably because of gyros
There's like 5 of them in Athens and i think that's it
Pretty much
Unless you are literally giving away food the fast food and delivery market is pretty saturated with local product in Greece, and that's just fine really
TGIF and Ruby Tuesday's chains also came and went at some point
Asking the real questions here
Compared to other places they aren't
What you said about the economy is probably true and further proves my point
Also I may be a bit but biased since I dont live in a huge city (Larisa) and McDonalds only opened last year, it wasn't that big of a deal tbh
I'd say yes, it'd be extremely weird if someone in his late 20s-30s couldn't cook anything
Cooking meat-pasta-rice-salads etc is super easy, healthy, and cheap compared with takeaway
I think younger generations can actually cook better than their parents
Firstly because they're more open-minded regarding different recipes/cuisines and secondly because of the range of information available online
It has never been easier to access culinary knowledge and tips
Italy, for sure
Una faccia una razza
Italy, Spain and Serbia
Lot's of love from Greece
We love you too bros(as long as you are in our side in ww3)
Quite different
Athens is a lot more hectic and busy (My family is from a Greek island)
I feel like time is a lot more abstract in the islands too, which can be good and bad
just look at the delayed ferries haha
According to the people I know who lived in both Athens and smaller cities or islands:
- Everything takes too much time to be done
A chore that may take 10mins somewhere else may take 2h in Athens cause of commute etc
(Keep in mind that Athens is dense af, 3 of its 4 sectors are among the 7 most densely populated european regions)
- Being the capital, it has a big variety of things to do, mostly when it comes to shopping or events/concerts
I'm pretty sure other big cities have a fair share of that though
- Athens does have some nice parts with natural beauty and nice architecture, but its concrete jungle part can be overwhelming
I don't know if there are other places so heavy on that part
- Athens lifestyle is more tense and it's more usual to come across tense people
From my experience, people in the islands are much more open-hearted than Athenians (of course that's a generalisation)
Not sure about Christmas but I'm pretty sure we have a new year's lottery
Btw, according to the custom, anything Santa related (for Greek orthodox christianity that's Saint Basil of Caesarea), is also moved up to New Year's Eve instead of Christmas' Eve
Spain : being treated tequillas by guys me and my friend had met 10 minutes ago
The whole party/tapas/pinchos culture
UK : argument with drunk Welsh girl if being Welsh is being British (it is, British includes English, Scottich and Welsh)
After agreeing to disagreeing we went to a pub with friends of mine and hers
France : I was 13 years old, school trip
Our professor misheard "treize" for "trois" and we walked 13 bridges of the Seine instead of 3 to get to our boat
We nearly missed it and whoever student could speak French (the professor did not !) was shouting "Arrete Capitan" to the captain
Italy : having wrong tickets for the train, and inspector smilng saying it is OK you did not know, just be careful
Small incident that makes you like a people (in contrast with Germany
Germany : I struggle to find
Probably when I tried to intervene when an inspector was bullying an 18 year old boy for having forgotten his train card and I managed to annoy him enough and waste his time to give him a pass
I winced at the kid and signaled him to get out in the 1st stop immediately before inspector changes his mind
Small incident that made me very happy to "beat" the hostile toe-the-line German system xDD
Switzerland : getting nice photos in Lake Luzern
Turkey :  merchants in Izimir speaking more Greek than English and trying to sell us whatever in completely random prices
We still do but if I mention him, I will have to wear cement shoes and go swimming totally voluntarily
Heya what did he do
If anyone needs more info, google about the Noor-1 case
You will be missed
I am not afr
Marinakis wants to know your location
Whom is this name you speak of
Never even heard of it, NEVER
I TELL YOU
Crete probably, it's the most self reliant of the regions all things considered, and have a pretty distinct character
Not to mention, they were briefly an independent country
Though being the "most likely" doesn't mean they actually want to
They are some of the most patriotic Greeks I've ever seen
Otherwise I would probably say Thrace purely because it has a sizable Muslim minority, but independence doesn't seem that popular for them either
we dont like to call them stray (even tho most of the time they are)
we like to call them "neighborhood pets"
Mostly cats
A few areas will have a few stray dogs but there are stray cats everywhere unfortunately
Quite a big one
Many of them, however, are not 100% stray
They just live on the street but the community takes care of their food and sometimes health
Not ideal by any means but it has to be pointed out
We have allot in greece but we don't consider it a problem
(for dogs)
Cats on the other hand are deliberately used as pest control
(It was also done in Russia I think, and the commemorated them with a huge cat statue
) Many tourists think it's because of pour government/economic crisis, which is frustrating as it is, when the truth is that we just don't like rats
Yes, and people think it's cute and stuff
It is fucking not, where do you think all these cats shit and piss
In my neighborhood we have a woman that feeds cats all around the neighborhood so many cats have gathered and since our apartment building is from the few in the neighborhood with dirt and grass patches it means many of the stray cats come to shit and piss in our block
They are fucking pests, if she loves them so much then she can take them in her house, I don't like going out of my house and smelling cat shit nor do I like toxoplasmosis
We used to have a gang of abandoned dogs as well but they gathered them up, but they do not do shit about the cats
Most of the time the strays are cats which you can’t tell if they are someone’s pet or not
As for dogs if they have a collar you know it’s someone’s, but if they don’t have a collar it’s usually that they are just stray
As anecdotal evidence, I don’t know anyone that has encountered aggressive stray dogs of any kind, they are friendly and want to be petted so they come up to you some times
They aren’t scared of people
A lot of people, even if they have no pets, leave out cat/dog food in a bowl and also water in another bowl
My old apartment used to leave water and pet food for any neighborhood pet, it’s a common thing
So yeah, they are actually neighborhood pets
No they are actually neighbourhood pets with everyone feeding the scraps and petting them
It is only a problem in semi-rural/urban areas where people go to abandon their pets and whole beards form that the locals can't take off
Those are the only instances you can find unattended, maybe hostile strays
Same in Greece, mostly used is blue then it's black
Of course the BIC pens were very common and Pilot I remember too
Parents being present at a kids' party is quite common in Greece for really young individuals (~ <10yo), or at least that was the case for me anyway
The parents mostly sit somewhere farther away and seldom interfere unless there's some sort of trouble, often chit chatting about irrerevant things
They also discuss school matters as most kids present also happen to be classmates from primary school
It's not uncommon for parents to just drop off their kids and pick them later, but since they all often become sort of friends due to their kids they usually enjoy the company
After growing up somewhat (say joining junior high), said kids start feeling quite uneasy at the mere thought of having their parents around them and their peers, therefore they promise they'll behave so that their parents can trust them enough to let them enjoy their party by themselves
It could go both ways in Greece
You can drop the kids of to a party and pick them up later but also a lot of parents might stay and socialize with the other parents
I don't think there is a rule
It depends on how well you know the other parents, if they ask to stay, wether you're busy etc
But I dont think its considered weird
no but we do some presentations as kids about diffrent customs and traditions around the country, for example when it's christmas we will each do a presentation about the diffrences in Christmas where we're from, at least that's what we do here in Attica where most of the population is
Yeah, that’s a real word, suuuuure
Golden dawn, a Greek far right party, didnt get enough votes to get in the parliament (thank god)
The absurd law that banned the police from entering university premises is getting abolished
Protected by this law, drug dealers, illegal immigrants and sorts of criminals were finding refugee inside, as well as anarchists retreating there after fights with police
Political youths in Athens' unis paint the buildings with slogans and litter it with posters, beat each other very often, and police can do nothing for all this
It is about to change
... or, if one looks at it from a non-government, non-right-wing supporter angle, the law that offers a basic level of protection to the most politically energetic part of the population (students) is getting abolished in an effort of the most right-wing, authoritarian government post-1975, to make it easier for itself to crack down on them
After all, this government is looking forward to a bright 4-year austerity future of making the rich richer at the expense of the poor, and don't want that getting terminated early by any violent societal pushback, spearheaded by the students
I like all three but I am not multilingual so probably not Switzerland, and Germany has a very foreign culture to us, at least compared to the other two, so probably Austria
If it was Germany, I would choose Bavaria either way
I also have a thing for Austria
It's a very interesting country
But as I said I really like them all
i'm not quite sure about across the country but the train inside of Attica (in and around Athens) is 1,40 €
and by a quick google it seems that the Athens-Thessaloniki train costs 20 €
(keep in mind that railroads within the country aren't as developed as the rest of europe because of our mountainous geography)
I have no idea cause I generally don't travel by train, but I only know that to get from where I live (Thessaloniki) to my hometown (Edessa), which is 100km away, the train ticket is 7€
Wow that's cheap
Pretty sure everything is based in Athens
Sophocles Antigone **in ancient Greek**, it was a nightmare for me since I was science orientated, although other classmates had not much problem with it
Ancient Greek is a mandatory school subject for two years in Greek Lyzeum (which is the equivilant to the German Gymnasium), so no, there's no way avoiding it
>tragedies are the hardest texts to translate
Tragedies are really tragedies ;p
You're right about that, cause the other book was Euripides Iphigenia in Tauris and it was actually much easier
Wait, it's been absolute ages since I graduated but I'm pretty sure I had ancient Greek for the whole 6 years of middle/high school, and I was in the Technology direction/specialisation
Is it only two years now
Iphigenia in Tauris
Why do I remember another one
Two years in Lyzeum back in the 90's, and I mean strictly ancient Greek, not the translated or semi-translated stuff we had in Gymnasium
Well, like I've said it wasn't my subject of choise and It has also been a long while since then, but I'm pretty sure we had this one in ancient Greek, or at least a big part of it
Ah right, thanks
we invented languages so whatever words you use is ours
The muslim immigrants promoted it so strongly
As they did with other words
Come to Greece and you'll get your money's worth of insane driving
I don't give a rat's ass about investments so my disposable income goes to things I want the most but my cousin and his wife,  each one making around a thousand euros per month, have already flipped two small apartments, listed another one in airbnb and bought a house for them just recently
so if you want, you can do stuff
Yes and No
It depends on a variety of factors
I, with a military income and my girlfriend who also military and gets paid the same we have enough to live with some minimum comfort like having more than one vehicles
Now most greeks have side businesses like  olive oil selling from middle october to middle December
The increased number of new cars on the roads after 2018, when the economic crisis ended prove that there is money in Greece
For the last 9 years my -now- husband and I speak in English even though I speak Greek to our kids and he speaks both to them too
Both him and I forget words in our languages, sometimes we substitute them with words from the other languages but yes it's so embarrassing
I also now catch myself speaking Greek to someome and then almost speaking English only to correct myself embarrassed
I always had people thinking I'm not Greek (redhead, fair skin) but because of that they now really think I'm a foreigner
All the bloody time,the funny thing is that i may remember the word in English but not in Greek
You forgot that cat in Cypriot Greek is cata (if I recall correctly)
Damn sounds like something that'd happen to me
Yes, same reason too
definitely sounds the best to me, and if I had to choose a Nordic language based on grammar or vocabulary, I'd still choose Danish
Not when it comes to numbers though
Swedes don't attack me pls
Edit: I was also surprised by how the phonology of Finnish is almost identical to that of Greek
I grew up with the Muppet Show, so Swedish it is

The situation is quite similar in Greece too

Have you seen the other ad about east Mediterranean
Do they at least make a profit
Your series are selling well here
TIL "Mega" is "Omega" in Cyprus
[This bullshit]
The simplifications that the greek language is undergoing
For example the word "mixture" in greek is μείγμα (meigma) but you can also write it down as μίγμα (migma)
And the thing that annoys me the most is the word καινούργιο (kainourgio) which can be written as καινούριο (kainourio)
The word καινούργιο means new in English and etymologically it is derived from words καινό and έργο (kaino ergo) which literally translates to recent act
Without the letter γ (gamma) it seems wrong to write it down if you look at the etymology
It could either go really great -Italy
Or really horrible - Turkey
(Or i guess Albania or Bulgaria) which is kinda already happening
Greece-Bulgaria-NMK-Albania-Turkey
I think this reminds of something from the past
We've got it pretty bad, our best scenario I guess would be Bulgaria, but you know
I guess you could merge with Lichtenstein
How exactly do you go more liberal that Sweden
Oh well, you might need The Communist Manifesto to solve that problem
I thought that knowing English meant that I would be able to communicate with locals (except for the elders) in every country I would visit
But then I went to France
Is that considered rude anywhere
It might seem a bit sad and pessimistic but there you go:
"Every place has its wounds
Britain has the fog, Egypt has ophthalmia, Wallachia has the grasshoppers and Greece has the Greeks
Εμμανουήλ Ροΐδης, 1836-1904, Greek writer
Haha, amazing quote
the Greek Supreme Court is Called  Άρειος Πάγος ( Arios Pagos) which is a place believed to be where Ares was tried by the Olympic Gods for the murder of the son of Poseidon, Alirrothios
The ancient Greek used that place tο try murderers and such
though i couldn't find any info to your question and i (a teenager) have no idea how those work i thought the name of the supreme court is a fun fact for anyone intrested in ancient history

I'm not gonna write the whole thing but it is similar to the English way
0-12 they have unique names but the rest is combination of tens digit + units digit
for example:
13 = δεκατρια (which is literally 10 and 3 pronounced as one word, 10=δεκα and 3=τρια)
after 21 we separate the words and this goes on to infinity
for example:
115=εκατον δεκα πεντε (which is literally  100 and 10 and 5)

We also have the weird thing where 11 and 12 sound different than the 13-19
11 édeka
12 dódeka
13 déka-tria
14 déka-tesera
And so on till 19 where 20 is ìkosi
21 is ìkosi-ena
And basically the only thing that changes is the prefix
31 is triáda-éna
41 is saráda-éna
51 is penínta-ena
61 is exínta-éna
71 is evdomída-éna
81 is ogdóda-éna
91 is enenída-éna
And 100 is ekató
After that everything repeats it self as before but now with Ekató, till ofc you reach 200 or 300 or 400 or 500
Greek has basically the exact same system as English
We say the same way in English
We put the tens first

Wrote all that and apparently no one saw it
meh
if by international fame you mean penetrating the US then the only that comes to mind is Vangelis (yep the guy who wrote the score of blade runner)
Maria Callas probably but she was born in the US
Rotting Christ, which I'm listening to right now :p
Rotting Christ \m/
Maria kalas
Gus G
And Trentemøller of course
First we give them the siima, then we pull the matto alta
> yanni
Yup he is, particularly in the past, though not as renown as Vangelis and definetely nowhere near Callas, which is seen as a national icon
I think we don't have a standard like you mentioned
People usually talk when they complain about something
One exception I can think of are taxi drivers
Sometimes they can't just shut the fuck up
My house was really far from my school so whenever i took the bus it was just me and the driver (after a couple of minutes more students would enter the bus) . At the end of the year we knew each other so well we could have actual conversations lol
Y... You're joking right
Pingu is a staple
Pretty much everyone has it, and it's been like that for a long time, way before the "hipster" wave
Young, old, babies, women, everyone
Extremely popular since forever, not to do with the recent fashion trend
I don't think I know a clean shaved man at this point
You know what they say about dwarves
beard pubes
Hahahaha
Man, I read this comment and I said to myself "this person is either Scottish or Irish" and then I saw your flair
Keep playing th harp my friend
Ahhhh fuck
I love Bill Bailey man, he's fucking gold
Very unique comedy
And my comment still applies anyway haha, it could easily have been Scottish/Irish humour
I'm here to remind everyone that we already have one cup
no need to push for a second or a third
we let the lesser teams have their fair chance to glory
Hebrew and Castilian Spanish
Italian
I wemt Erasmus in Italy
Loved the language
Greek
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one
I agree too, but the way they talk in Athens especially (not the sassy way we speak in the province)
Why
Hebrew is awesome
Ani medaberet ktzat ivrit :D
Ataturk and some other Young Turks like Talaat Pasha
Gotse Delchev
Ironically both Ataturk and Delchev were born in what is now Greece
Maybe Basil II, the Bulgar Slayer a Byzantine emperor
Kemal Ataturk
He is a hero in Turkey and a villain in Greece
Pretty much all of our national heroes are considered villains in at least one of our neighboring countries, especially Turkey
Yes, and also the genocide of pontic Greeks
Judgement crow stare
>so similar
Since when is Islam similar to Christianity
And I don't mean the religion but the culture
Our societies are totally incomparable
Deltsev is not a well known personality in modern Greece, not sure why he was mentioned
Have you ever considered what being a woman in Turkey means
As for religion and rules Greece is a secular society so rules apply only if you feel like it
What about Turkey
Have you ever been there
When the imam starts to call to prayer everybody stops what ever is doing, total silence
Men and women sit separately in cafes even in Trabzon
And if you go to the interior is like Iran or Afghanistan
They live in the fucking MIDDLE AGES there
>from a credible place
I have been all over Turkey except the south east
I believe Trabzon to be a rather European city in Turkey
The cafe was on the sea front
There was an aisle in the middle, at the right only men, on the left women with children
It was no exception, all the cafes were like that
Afghanistan (I have never been there) is probably a far exaggeration of mine but Erzerum was pretty close to Iran
10% of women wore burkas and not even one had her head uncovered
Alcohol nowhere to be found
The country side was mud bricks and dung for fuel
I really don't know
What do you thing would be a more appropriate word to use
My English failed me on this one
It's more likely the whole world will speak Greek, than Greeks to forget their language and speak English
We didn't lose our language when the Romans came, we didn't lose our language when the Ottomans came, I have little fear we will lose it to the Anglos
That said, I do find myself using many English words while speaking Greek (it doesn't help that I live abroad and my working language at home is english (wife doesn't speak greek well enough))
But that is normal, our language absorbs many words from the dominant language of the period and just incorporates them
Not worried we will start just using english completely though
I'm trying to learn czech because I moved to the czech rep
a few years back
I speak 4 languages to a very high level (greek, english, italian, spanish)
I cannot for the life of me grab the czech language from anywhere
It's just a bizarre language altogether
I've done a course and before covid had a private tutor weekly
I'm learning (very slowly) but it's like 10 times as hard as any other language I've learned
If I had lived in any other European country (maybe not Hungary) for 4 years I think I would be at least able to have a normal conversation at the bar etc
Not in czech though
And it's not because everyone speaks English or anything
Like I have to struggle with my broken czech almost daily
It just doesn't click with anything else I know
In Greece we have the Klephts and the Armatoles who fought against the Ottomans
Klephts behaved more like outlaws while Armatoles more like an irregular army
&#x200B;
From ancient and mythical Greece we have iconic groups of warriors such as the Spartans, the Amazons, the Argonauts, the Myrmidons, etc
The Cretan archers were considered to be the amphibians of the eastern Roman empire, as they were excellent with ships and ground battles, especially in archery
Probably sometime during the Minoan or the Mycenean civilizations
Bonus to the Minoans cause their women walked around topless
ΠΑΣΟΚ
Look at this man of culture over here
Unfortunately Poland has a very big rural population, who is disgustingly conservative in social issues (LGBT, gender equality etc) and very easily bought from social programmes because they were feeling as "B citizens" for years
PiS gave them money for children (always people with lower education have more children), for animals (farmers) and also supports their conservative very Catholic mentality
So this mixture of left-wing economics, right-wing social views and indirect bribing makes this homophobic, wanna-be authoritarian party the sure winner again
I am sorry for my friends in Poland (who are all very liberal, have tertiary education and live in big cities, aka they are the minortity) who have to live under this kind of government
Ah also for some reason Polish people STILL watch state TV (PiS propaganda tool), I haven't figured out yet why
About TV, I meant that we are in 2019, internet and social media era, there are countless sources of information, how is still relying on STATE TV possible
Even in non-PiS environments, state TV is widely known to be pro-government in many countries
I do not excuse voting radicals because they put money in your pocket
Where do we draw the line
If they start jailing people
Killing
Where is the line where "getting more money" is not enough reason to vote for scumbags
And if the 500+ stuff was enough, PiS wouldn't have launched this disgusting homophobic campaign
The fact is that Poland has a too big rural population, which is 30 years in the past in certain issues
5: Athens, Athens - Airport, Thessaloniki (the first IKEA in Greece, from 2001), Larissa and Ioannina
Apparently only 5,i never bothered looking it up because I live 5 minutes from one
We only have 5 in Greece :(
For me I would also say Balkans geographically and not at a very big extent culturally, but still I see us have some similarities to the stereotypical Balkan culture
never say that again
That would probably anger the most people
Greece is a regional power so to say economically speaking, but it's more Greece with some Balkan influences from a cultural point of view and not the other way around
No, but I've heard some people do it
Always
And everyone I know does it, too
It isn't really established here, it depends on each person
Obviously a savage if you don't, though
Sure thing, Satan
As much as I love Spain and all my Mediterranean bros, I can't forgive such an act

Tarama or Taramasalata or taramosalata
We basically call it "The Poor Man's Caviar".
Stroopwaffel
You can find them in some places in the US if you are from there
Look for LIDL or ALDI stores they have them
Any hot beverage
You put the waffle over the hot drink until it becomes a bit softer and mmmm creamy
Apparently Trader Joe has them
I'm sorry :)
Colorado greens and Stroopwaffels will be exactly like Amsterdam ;p
Zorbas's syrtaki
Fuck yeah
They're delicious
Usually as stew with shallots
Edit: Recipe
Absolutely not weird
But I experienced the exact same thing in the US

but almost all Americans seem to think goat is weird
I live in New York

[Out of Africa]
Greece and Cyprus
Montenegro and serbia
Please don't get offended by this
Apart from Greece-Turkey-Cyprus I would also say Greece and Italy
But not all of Italy, just the south
I was in Sicily for a while and I was always amazed by how dirty the cities are and how cheerful the people seem to be despite them living with an obviously lower standard compared to the north
Also loud, a lot of fish like Greece, and a very social
I adored them
We really aren't tho
Starting with religion (which is a huge thing)
I want to deeply apologise that the replies to your comment ended up this way
Both greece and turkey are usually very civil on reddit and we usually end up exchanging wishes and/or heart emojis if Thephalanx23 doesn't join the thread
I disagree, everyone who has had even the most basic level of interaction with the other country aknowledges the similarities
We have tons of cultural similarities with Turkey, both the good and the bad things: traditional music, cuisine, a mainly extroverted mentality, toxic masculinity, political corruption
Also, I have no idea about the modern architecture, but there are loads of greek temples all over turkey's coast if that counts as architectural similarity
sometimes since Greek and Latin are pretty similar
Most of them are pretty easy since they originate from greek

Aromanian or Vlach as it's known in Greece
While Vlach means Romanian from the region of Wallachia in the rest of the world, in Greece it encompases all Eastern Romance speaking languages
The language it is used by those of Aromanian or "Macedo-Romanian" heritage
Even though the Romanians are the only people, with their own country that speak a Latin language while being in Eastern Europe
There are other Romance- speaking people here; one of them is the Aromanians
These people were essentially living in Southeast Europe where Romans mixed with the local people
Nikolaos Plastiras
He fought in the Balkan wars, first world war and minor Asia war
He didn't have a single defeat, even in the minor Asia war where Greece lost, his team was undefeated and when he learned that everything was lost, he run to Izmir and personally organized the evacuation
Noted that in the Balkan wars, he protected the Turkish unarmeds from the Bulgarians
In the second world war he was very active in the resistance during the Axis occupation, then after the civil war he was appointed Prime Minister to organize the country so Greece could go to normal elections
He then gave women the right to vote and made homosexuality legal even though there weren't any LGBT movements and the feminist movements had little to no influence back then
He got elected 3 times as Prime Minister, but he didn't own a house, but he rented because he didn't steal money from the state
When the national bank learned about it, they offered him a loan with zero tokens and he could pay it whenever he could, but he refused
During his last moments, he was laid in a military bed in his house
The queen paid him a visit and asked him why is he doing this and paraphrasingly he answered "that's the life I'm used to and I don't need anything else".
Here in Greece "Love, you are undefeatable in battle" from *Antigone* is pretty recognisable and kind of used
I have never in my life heard of "ϗ". What does it look like handwritten
Wow, I've actually seen that before but it never occurred to me that it's a different symbol, I always read it as "κ" like short for "και". Pretty cool, thanks
Obviously no, but I'd like to see constituencies have more control than the centralised Parliament, so such things aren't questioned when it comes to politics
Same with greeks
it's very annoying I hate it
Yep
We need to be noticed, and more importantly HEARD from all distances
It's our superpower
I think not only because it was in the center but also because of its Historical importance, being the most important ancient Greek city and the source of the most popular Ancient Greek people (Sokrates, Pericles etc)
Also by googling i found this
"Ancestor worship
The first capital of Greece was Nafplio (Nauplia), which was an important port in Ottoman times, while Athens was an insignificant village that attracted the odd Western tourist
In 1834, King Otto (himself a Western tourist) decreed that the capital of Greece shall be the most important city of Ancient Greece
For after all, Otto was King of the Hellenes
By someone named Nick Nicholas
Following the Greek War of Independence and the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons
Also majority of people live Athens
History and stuff
No, really, Athens was a small village at the time of our independence and it was later chosen to be the capital because of its historical significance (mostly to showcase a continuity with ancient Greece etc
"Χέστηκα" (Ch**e**stika), which literally translates to "I shat myself". This one's the most common one I could come up with
Then we have "Δε μου καίγεται καρφί" (De mu k**e**gete karf**i**), which I have trouble translating, if we were to go for a word to word translation it'd be something along the lines of "I don't have any nail that's burning"/"No nail burns for me". Not as common
We also have "Δε δίνω δεκάρα" (De d**i**no dek**a**ra), "I don't give a dime". Again, mostly used by older people
There's a lot, but the most common is
Στα αρχίδια μου (Sta archidia mou) = To my balls/testicles
In Greece it is mandatory to take ancient Greek lessons to learn the language
Most kids hate it because we have more hours of ancient Greek than physics for example
Cheesecake is Greek

I don't see the connection between the Middle East and Catalonia
I dont believe that this is the case
The problem is that Spain is a member of the EU, and Spain is a ~~federal structured~~ decentralised  country
Many things have to be dealt internally
The EU has to be as subjective as it can be and that means that in order to accept a Catalan independence everything needs to be done according go the book and the Spanish Constitution, which is going to be hard
If EU doesnt hold this stance , it will aggravate a member state, it will directly interfere in their internal politics about division and administration and it could probably lead into a domino effect
This is just one of those cases that need patience and careful planning IMO
Same thing in greek, the word for miss (δεσποινίς) is pretty outdated, and sounds very old-fashioned and creepy
I've mostly heard it used jokingly
Males -> -akis
Females -> -itsa
I suppose “-os” for males
For example:
Dimitris -> Mitsos
Konstantinos->Kotsos
Stamatis -> Stamos
Either that or just removing letters and simplifying
ex:
Ioannis -> Giannis
Konstantinos->Kostas/Kostis
Georgios -> Giorgos
Amalia -> Amalitsa -> Litsa
-ákis for males and -áki for females
e.g.
Kóstas -> Kostákis
Giorgos -> Giorgákis
Antonis -> Antonákis
and
Sofia -> Sofáki
Maria -> Maráki
The male names keep their gender but the female ones turn to neuter
Also
Males -> - oulis Females -> - oula

Am I the only one that hates this, since most of my friends and I use facebook
Also, discord and reddit (heck even instagram) dont have my favorite and most useful feature of messenger, speech bubbles ( on mobile)
I just hope that if it dies out, the next chat app also has bubbles
Although they're doing something on Android 11 with chat bubbles for all apps, but it seems kinda wonky for now, you need to pin specific contacts or something and only those contacts are permanent bubbles it seems (haven't tried it, can't say for sure)

14% downvoted, that's a lot of people who refuse to understand the basic values of the western world
I agree with him but his reasoning isn't entirelly correct
Its a slippery slope, if I ban this comic then I would restrict further and further freedom of speech to the point of people having the inability to speak about each other
Its like saying that if a parent gives soda to their kid on their birthday because its a special day, then they would give it soda every weekend , and then every day and after that they would give them cigarettes on every birthday then every weekend then every day
Obviously while all these things could happen saying that if you give your kid soda on their birthday you might give your kid crack every day isnt rational
This might seem silly but its actually important
We see this mistake fallacy used a lot lately by anti maskers "now you make us wear masks then you are going to control every part of our lives". So to recap my point
Yes ,we shouldn't ban art that ridicules religions but not because something worse might follow but rather because restricting freedom of speech itself has bad consequences on people/society
Crazy that he is basically "ELI5-ing" the basic concept of freedom of speech, in 2020
Some people might need explanations on why to breathe to survive I guess

yup the road isn't a death pit
Glad we didn't change that one
For real what are you all on about, roads are incredibly useful and important infrastructure, they also allow for easy and cheap public transport
Lets also not forget that there are pedestrian roads for high foot traffic areas and parks if you want to run around or something
As a clarification "cheap" in that a city can create a bus line with minimal cost because the infrastructure is mostly already there
Best part is when they're also filled with garbage
As if a trash collecting truck exploded in there

Europeans: The evil, lazy greeks steal our money
Meanwhile thousands of ancient Greek and Eastern roman artifacts (which they took by conquering and murdering thousands of us) chilling in Western Europe
Well,Britain can return the marbles and join the club with France, Germany, Netherlands
Most of them are based tbh
British museum has A TON of Greek artifacts
The only 2 ones that Greeks really want back are the Parthenon marbles, and the Karyatid
Nothing else
imagine comparing Iraq to Greece
Embarrassingly uninformed
For that we are thankful (even though they caused significant damages to the Parthenon in Athens)but there's no argument to keep them there anymore
Meanwhile in the Berlin museum, Pergamon Altar
In the Louvre, the victory of Samothrace
Just two other very famous ones that were stolen
Just casually justifying theft
[Yeah only they destroyed the marbles too]
> To facilitate transport by Elgin, the columns' capitals and many metopes and frieze slabs were either hacked off the main structure or sawn and sliced into smaller sections, causing irreparable damage to the Parthenon itself
> Yet another effort to clean the marbles occurred in 1937–38
This time the incentive was provided by the construction of a new Gallery to house the collection
The Pentelic marble mined from Mount Pentelicus north of Athens, from which the sculptures are made, naturally acquires a tan colour similar to honey when exposed to air; this colouring is often known as the marble's "patina"[71] but Lord Duveen, who financed the whole undertaking, acting under the misconception that the marbles were originally white[72] probably arranged for the team of masons working in the project to remove discolouration from some of the sculptures
The tools used were seven scrapers, one chisel and a piece of carborundum stone
They are now deposited in the British Museum's Department of Preservation
[72][73] The cleaning process scraped away some of the detailed tone of many carvings
[74] According to Harold Plenderleith, the surface removed in some places may have been as much as one-tenth of an inch (2
5 mm)
[72]
> The British Museum has responded with the statement that "mistakes were made at that time
"[75]

How does that compare to Greece in 2020 still eludes me
Ask the Turks and Venetians
Did you just try to prove a point with zero historical knowledge to back it up
She was stolen a few years before the Greek revolution so I wouldn’t say she doesn’t want to go back
I wouldn't mind if these countries return what they stole but that's a different topic for another time
The focus is on the Parthenon Marbles
Britain is presented an enormous opportunity to return the marbles back to Greece
Greece in 2021 will celebrate the 200 years since the Independence from Ottomans
Britain would benefit from closing an ongoing dispute with Greece, improve its relation with Greece and in return Greece could push for some of Britain's requests in the post Brexit agreement

Not to sound like a fedora tipping Atheist, but Poland is a contemporary example of a European nation where the church has managed to amass enough power to be influential

At least now we have vaccines
No they shouldn't, are you serious
The average person has nowhere near enough medical and scientific knowledge to distinguish bullshit from reality, and they just end up trusting "authorities" that tell them the opposite of the doctors
They like it, because it makes them feel smarter than everyone else and "a part of the few people who know THE TRUTH" but in reality it's just a bunch of bullshit talking point that are false but exhausting to argue against so you just let them do whatever they want and they end up dying or killing people

This has serious meme potential
Whoever gave the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle" award has some really dark humour
Regardless of the way the Turks wanna justify it, it just can't be done
They were literally fighting to keep an empire from falling apart just because it was theirs
There is no way to justify that and they were rightfully dismantled after the war
Enemies or not, relocation or genocide, their cause was a tainted one from the start
That's painful to watch
Greeks as well, any Christians really

It was not humour
Do you think if Greece changes its name to Yunnanistan Turkey will be nice enough to give us our ancient borders back

Well even after the referendum, the vast majority voted for Tories and Labour who ran on Brexit campaigns so
Translation: If we don't like the result, it is not democracy
Meanwhile I'm sat here thinking, where could you get signs like that
Well maybe if Remain is so important then said voters shouldn't vote for parties that run on Brexit
Just a thought
Well as an outsider, the Brexit vote seemed quite clear to me
Either stay or go
It doesn't make any sense to have a vote between Remain and Norway-type deal, because it's more or less the same, with Remain being the sensible option
Looks smaller than what I would have expected
Hey if you're looking forward to visiting Greece, yes Athens is a good choice but as a Greek I would suggest that you visit one of our islands
Making a success out of Brexit is a strong word, considering that the only issue that existed from day 1 was the island of Ireland
There has been no realistic or even achievable proposal for that issue from the UK side
She should have included the Labour Party in the negotiations to make sure they knew what the real deal of negotiating such a deal is, and secure the votes she needed
Her party is filled with delusionals (or simply self serving crooks), that prefer a hard Brexit over a fair deal
The electorate was misinformed and played
Thus the decision is not a well informed one
You should try and read about demagogues and the havoc they reap in the societies they thrive in
BTW there is a reason why referendums in a representative democracy aren't and should never be binding
Brexit will show you why (deal or no deal)
No she do not
The referendum is not binding
My post implies she didn't try for that
She tried to keep her party together, and is failing at that too
Everyone else: great lads
Englishmen: they can fuck off
I definitely agree with this view of Europe tbh
I don't know what I expected, but yeah, that sounds about right for Germans

75 years ago children couldn’t go to school because there was war
Before that they couldn’t go to school because they had to work
For a few years after the war they couldn’t go to school because schools were destroyed
Comparing the generations that actually went to school with those that didn’t, I conclude that children SHOULD go to their freaking schools and they can protest on a Saturday or a Sunday
Claiming that you sacrificed school in order to be an activist is the biggest bullshit of the century and will lead to many problems in both the children’s future and the planet’s.

He married 8 gay guys
From the history books a hundred years from now:
"2020 was not a good year
There was a deadly virus pandemic killing people , at some point in september archaeologists found 30 mummies in mint condition in Aegypt and decided to open the sarcophagi, and as soon as they did that, the Titan Enceladus woke up under Aeta and decided to ruin Christmas
Thankfully the greek pantheon woke up too after 2 milennia of sleep and Athena buggerred the unruly Titan with a prize winning leak" (kudos to whoever gets the reference)
Shut up Enceladus or I m sending Athena again and this time she wont throw the mountain on your head, she will shove it
you know how it goes
Oh did the new patch drop
Nice
Can someone link the patch notes
Alien invasion coming right up
2 years ago i was staying on a village just below etna
( Linera for anyone curious )
Flew out on the morning of december 24, 2018
Literally 3 hours after i left the volcano erupted and airports closed down
Seems like its a common occurence there
2020 be like: I still have some time to fuck em up
Nice lets go and gather some gold
8 days till the end of 2020
Those days are gonna be the worst
Good luck everyone
Low taxes
Greece welcomes you to the club
It's 5°C then the next day it might be 21°C then 6°C. What is this madness
Get ready for a really really REALLY BAD SUMMER
I've got a friend in Odense and he said there hasn't been snow there since 2016, kinda odd to me considering I'm from a supposedly hot country and we get snow every year where I live (this year doesn't count cause it's globally cursed lol)
Might've exaggerated, I'll call him out
A few days ago he smoked in a bar as well, which is also illegal [link]  edit: gr link
So, here's the sad truth
He summarizes fairly well the entire political and social grounds of the country I live in, Greece
It's mostly Careless Hypocrites
That's the most greek thing I've ever seen, he makes us proud *tears*
This is a piece of shit Union thug, that used strikes to crawl up into a pseudoleftist party and now he is a Minister
His tweeter is TD tier
Like, he is doxxing people
He said during an interview that if his party wants to be re-elected, they're gonna have to start putting people in prison
The GM of the hospital he worked for was recently found out he had 4 (four) forged diplomas
When reporters asked the Minister of Health about this scandal he said "why are you asking me, I am not going to answer to you", yelled about how the press is controlled by the opposition and they only ask about the bad things and finished by telling them "all of you versus me, I have you".
And this is just one of the member of the incompetent, toxic gang of Mr
Tsipras that governs us atm
Fuck
This
Noise
That s really greek of him
...First off, fuck your bitch and the click you claim
Westside when we ride come equipped with game
You claim to be a player but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boy niggaz fucked for life
He didn't choose the thug life
Welcome to Greece
Yeah most of our government is corrupt as hell and doesn't even do what we want them to
Even when we protest on the streets
Something like in USA, maybe even worse, but nobody gives a shit because we are a small country
What an animal
I apologise on behalf of my country and on behalf of my generation of younger people that even though we understand that this kind of behaviour is wrong, the only thing we do is laugh and move on
I apologise for us being being one of the reason this continent gets bad reputation sometimes, and I apologise for the low level of cooperation my compatriots show with other countries of the E.U. almost on a daily basis
The sad part is, that people who understand that a change needs to be made on this country’s social and economic culture, often give up and migrate when they realise that it is an impossible task
I left Greece 7 years ago and still to this day I get sad when I realise the country that once upon a time promoted science, medicine and democracy now promotes extreme ideologies, lack of education and a tendency to believe that we are the best in world and everyone else is wrong when we clearly have failed over and over again for many decades to achieve even smallest level of healthy growth and development
He just wanted to show everyone how stupid people look when they smoke
Don't tell me you can find a better paradigm from that
The timing, his hands position
its all perfect
Another anti-Greek thread with dozens of northern euros flexing their superiority complex
Northerners will never change, it’s only been a few dozen years since you went on a barbarian rampage
It’s stupid to ban cigs in bars when the bar is peddling its own poison
It also depends on the bar or club from my experience, the darker it is the more likely smoking will be allowed, if there is bright lighting then less smoking
FINALLY a truly greek-wit comment
Had to look so far down for this one
Cheers man :')
Dude the man is shit but there's no one like him in the government
Well, smoking rules do not apply to anyone in Greece to be fair ... when there are so many smokers, people stop caring, so it is not a privilege at the very least
We hope to keep the peace
It's Greek, so it should be /r/notthekoulouri
[To Koulouri / The Bagel] is the Greek equivalent of The Onion
Ieremias klarxonopoulos
Hahaha I got you bro
You just have to get used to us
lmao
Is Greece looked down upon
Interesting
At least we didn't put people in ovens
**Panagiotis Kouroumplis**, the Minister of Naval Affairs that during the Saronikos oil spill (1st
2nd day
) said on live TV that people should resume swimming because it is safe
KEELPNO (our CDC) had to do an emergency information campaign because no, it was not safe to swim in an oil spill
**Alexis Tsipras**, Prime Minister, said on live TV to a victim of the Mati wildfire that "even if he gave her 2000 euros, she'd waste them" (actually the wildfire produced bucketloads of sick comments from members of the gov and parliament
**Tasia Vhristopoulou**, Minister of Immigration Policy in 2015, said that "there are no immigrants in downtown Athens, just people who are enjoying the sun"
**Christos Bgialas**, member of Parliament, said "why should a 17 year old today care about who Koufontinas killed
" Koufontinas was the main hitman of the 17 November terrorist group, which was responsible for 23 assassinations of foreign and Greek civilians
**Eucledes Tsakalotos**, Minister of Economics, said from the podium in London about the pensioners "there is no delicate way to say this, but these people will abandon the system by nature"
**Kostas Zouraris**, Vice Minister of Education "You think now we are threatened as a country, Erdogan is only asking for a few islands
Even if we lose a few islands it's ok, we'll take them back"
And so many more
These people are psychopaths
Roasted
[cries in greek]
ITS TIME TO STOP
Did he remove the spine of a homosexual to keep as a trophy
Like I've read here beore, Brexit to those who wanted to leave only makes sense if UK was the first of many countries to leave EU, since "EUSSR" is evil and horrible and nobody wants to be in it
Must be kind of awkward now, although EU still needs to reform and be more open and push for investments to boost youth employment, otherwise Brexit people might end up being right
Hungary needs an intervention at this point
It's government has turned rogue
Hungarians don't want any scary brown immigrants to come into their country, but they also don't want to work more to cover the labor shortage
They want to kick out the "evil leftists" and support a fascist government, but they don't like it when said government practices fascism by taking away labor rights
Hungarians want the cake and eat it too
That's not going to happen
Accepting migrants into your borders because the EU forced you to and integrating them into your workforce are 2 completely different things
i dont know
if i was Denmark, i would be more careful mocking the "chosen one" :)
apparently i **should had** added the /s
u/racist-femboy
Fascists and femboys wasn't a combination i expected to see today
Does he know that the "girl" is actually a man
How is he far right
He has some VERY unpopular opinions, might even call him an asshole
But far right
we have these in August, Greece, just amazing:)
Have a bad feeling we're not goint to hear more about him and sadly we will probably forget it too
Woah, I am really out of the loop, what happened
All I know from this guy is that I heard he got poisoned a while ago(?)
The fact that a person can be so stupid is beyond me
The irony
I've seen this shit by Greek fascists too, how the fuck don't they see the irony
Oooo nie thats bad
Cretin
As we say: μαλακές παντού (malakas everywhere)
European neonazis are the definition of cucks
Reminds me of the far-right party back in my country
The SS genocided entire villages, committed endless atrocities to the greek people, and they dare call themselves patriots while having swastika tattoos and doing nazi salutes
They were declared a criminal organization recently
Good riddance
I feel the same way about Golden Dawn supporters
I can't imagine Hitler had good plans for the Mediterranean peoples in a Nazi regime, at best we would have been second-class citizens
How does one just happen to have his hand in a fucking nazi salute
So you're saying they would do what, suspend the elections and take over the factories in order to bring about communism when they're in power
I just looked at their website, and it's bog standard center-left stuff
Lower taxes for the poor, pour money into public healthcare, inclusivity etc
It's ridiculous to compare them to fascists
I can see that, but that doesn't mean the party is communist lol
Just like a few Nazis voting for PiS doesn't make them a fascist party
Their agenda doesn't deviate from mild Nordic-style wealth redistribution
\*sips a cup of Remainers tears\*
Nice
Cries in Greek
The same thing happened in Greece too
Athens had special carriages to collect the bodies of people that died on the streets due to starvation
My grandparents had to sell almost everything of value in order to survive
The were rich before the war and lost everything
Their mansion was big and half of it was taken by the Germans to house officers
The "funny" thing is that while my grandparents were starving they would see the Germans bring large quantities of food for their own consumption
Never they were given anything
Even a loaf of bread
Amazing news
A dictator going down is definitely positive news, but the opposition being backed by the Church and the reason for their win being that the Montenegrins ran to defend the church is worrisome
there are already too many religious conservatives in Eastern Europe governments
Sure, if you count Turkey as European
Russia: Can't be imprisoned if you're dead
*taps head*
This comment makes images of face-lifted neon-drenched 106s and fake Adidas pop up in my head like PTSD
MP like military police
Yeah the EU would be pretty great for me
if I were a bank
or Germany
They sold MY nation to the bankers
Just to be clear this is not supposed to attack Germany but the eu structure
I strongly believe that every country is obliged to do what’s best for its people
The eu may have done some good things about social problems but has made a mess of many countries’ economies
Generally it pushes for austerity measures even though they keep not working
And the eu central bank (which is too independent to be so powerful in my opinion) basically has the power to hold hostage every members economy, sound like a system that is not very democratic
I believe that is very easy to only see the good things if you are not a citizen of  Southern Europe
It’s not all about who gets money directly
Germany basically controls all of Europe
Portugal Greece Cyprus Ireland, all of those economies were torn down but somehow Germany managed to get a profit out of it
Even the devaluation of Greek bonds was not applied to those held by the European bank in Frankfurt
And generally Europe always follows the political route that seems to benefit the German economy even if the majority won’t benefit from it
I agree that greece was in a bad place but now it is sinking even deeper in debt
Nearly everyone that has studied its problem has agreed that its debt is not sustainable(including the IMF) and should be relieved(something that was applied in Germany in 1953)
However the eu keeps pushing for reforms that clearly won’t change anything
The eurozone system is flawd by definition
You cannot have the same currency with such different economies
If Greece was not in the eurozone it would simply devaluate its currency and go on with lesser imports
But Greece traded that power when joining the eu with stability and support
Remember that the vast majority of the money the eu is sending is going to bail out banks
But its the that people have to put up with the austerity measures
I would very much like being part of a unified europe but this is not it
This is not a way that a democratic union should be
This is how colonial territories work
So in your opinion Greek people should eternally suffer the consequences of our parents actions
Since the debt is not sustainable Greek should be forever subject to The EUs decisions with no chance of ever getting autonomy
Seems fair
RIP to the people whose faces are crystal clear in this photo
Jokes on you
There is no river in Athens, we put cement all over it
I would die to live in a city like that, but I am stuck in Athens,which is not even close to anything in this map
Not Athens
I would say it's more like a map of every european city that had solid history since 1400 till now
Or map of every central european city, because I can't think of any mediterranean city that actually is like this
I do believe that abortion is murder, besides if the mother's life is in danger
And no, I don't think you should abort your child if you get raped
Adoption is always a thing
Also, I'm still sceptical if someone should abort her child if the fetus has health issues but I truly do support the protests
Edit: Me: *supports the protests*
Reddit: mm yes D O W N V O T E
Damn he was only 62 at the picture but he looks like 82
In Greece they said that not everyone can be tested and people have been turned down
WHY TF DO WE KEEP STATS AND NUMBERS THEN
sounds to me like classic misinformation tactics
This is the Greek prime minister's tweet about it, saying how he's a true friend and hopes that the US-Greek relationship will become stronger now
Now imagine if Biden ends up being worse than Trump
Did we finally elect biden in europe
Thank god I guess
Even in the european sub we have to listen about this
I guess we want daddy usa on our case
It's lovely when mods don't even follow the sub rules
Ridiculous
How does this officially happen
I'm sure that BBC and AP are not supposed to decide who is president elect, so what is the official body that does this and when should we expect the outcome
I know that Trump is butthurt and appealing so I'm wondering how long this can last and how is it normally resolved
what the fuck how have I not seen this
They don't have the senate, they can't actually do something in the first 2 years and if they go with 'bi-partisanship' and working things out with the republicans they will lose the mid-terms election even harder as they will neither have support for their policies nor will thy have anti-republican sentiment like the anti-Trump sentiment that exist now
Meanwhile republicans will fire up their base by convincing them that Biden is Marxist Devil himself
You want USA style 'democracy' to be promoted in Europe
Or do you want more US military interventions in our vicinity which has caused us so many issues we have to deal with
Angela, it's OK I'm a mouth breather
What a bright young man
And he's down with the youth too
Nothing like that old hag Merkel
Yolo swag all the way to the polls
When it comes to protests corona is like nah I respect that no infections today
It’s an actual revolution at this stage
dare I say better than the old one
They needed to fit a corner of America somehow
Italy faces new restrictions
Learn how this affects USA
What's going on
Are they cutting down the trees to make farm land or something
Also, Greece is mostly mountains, plains full of rocks where no tree can grow and sandy beaches
Greece: This is way too much *picks up torch*
In Crete where I live, there's a historical myth, that's most likely correct, that says that the island was filled with trees but the ottoman sultan cut them down for the empire's fleet
Yeah, I was there last week
Based
Cry me a river
You need to take a long hard look at why a post makes 25k in such a short time, as well as the OP and top commenters pattern of posting, instead of just accepting it as normal and "discussion".
On the contrary, I think*even more* brigading is needed, for a post on a non-default subreddit like ours, to hit the generic/non-user-custom frontpage, like this one did
I appreciate your monitoring
I don't remember that specific cows post, but was it really 3rd place on Popular/Everywhere, like this one
(Now it dropped to 6th BTW, it was 3rd a few time ago)
Perhaps we should examine it in relation to how broken the people think their own system is
I mean the US isn't a utopia, but it's definitely better than my own country's system
where are we
They are just Polishing US's doorknob
Pavlos Fyssas, Greek rapper, antifascist activist was murdered by Neo- Nazis
Another fun story is the one of Zack Kostopoulos
An LGBTQ activist who got locked inside a jewellery by an automated locking system
To get out, he had to break the glass door with a chair
When he eventually got out by crawling through broken glass, the owner of the jewellery store and a random bystander were there and they beat him to a pulp while he was in the ground in pain
Eventually the police came and beat him up even more while he was on the ground
He died on the way to the hospital
Greek right-wingers have tried to frame this as him trying to rob the store, as him being under the influence of drugs or/and alcohol, or him having a knife
All of whom have been proven false
His murderer's trials are on 21/10 (10/21 for Americans)
And nobody is in jail yet
I remember when we were out on the streets protesting, thinking we’d change something
α ρε Παύλο, θα πληρώσουν.
Ah since we're honoring this great antifascist let's all take a moment to listen to his final song, "Angela Merkel"
&#x200B;
And for our foreign friends who don't understand the lyrics, let me translate some parts of it:
&#x200B;
"Angela, I would like one day to fuck you on a penthouse
Yes and on the edge, I would hold you by the hair and suddenly upon the climax to kick you down
Angela, learn that from high up here you are like a vision splattered on the ground
I want to piss on your smashed body and play reggae bass with your intestines
Angela my baby, in my nightmare, you look like my most beautiful and living dream
I want to be a child-killer, my booboo, I want you to become the mother of my child"
Yeah, Pavlos Fyssas such a gentle soul that he was and with his noble contribution to the antifascist cause, is truly being missed
What bullshit
The guy was no hero,he was quite a fascist himself
Once again the so called "anti-fascist" are trying to play victims
They conveniently emit that their "lot" burned down 3 innocent people by firebombing a bank some years ago
I've posted the wiki article
But you're right
Also 7 years after the murder , the trial is still ongoing
Nobody is in jail yet
Edit : I didn't anticipate so much hype
I was expecting only downvotes because r/europe
Here is the wiki article for visibility
The reason for the post is that in a few days (7/10/20) there will be the court verdict
Not only for the murderer, Roupakias but also for their Organisation, the fucking Golden Dawn and their  chain of command .
And for the Greek Democracy
Thank you brother
>This honestly just feels like political propaganda meant to frame a political group as victims, in order to garner support for their radical ideology
Dead on the money
List of victims by far left terror group 17 N in Greece:
They did not call themselves antifa back then,but judging by the comments of the people here defending antifa,they are pretty much on the same ground as these
Before Fyssas was murdered, the neonazis that killed him had been normalized in the public sphere by the media and by people like you
The shameless victim blaming spree you went on in the comments doesn't say "I dislike political extremes and I care about Marfin", it screams "I empathize more with neonazis and I will act as an apologist for them".
You're making a fool of yourself, log off and spare us the secondhand embarrassment
Go away golden dawnist
in this case it was literally Nazis though
Golden dawnist spotted
Bullcrap,nobody was normalized in the public sphere,least of all golden dawn
The media absolutely hated golden dawn,they had a black-out on them and constantly ran negative reports on them,how can you say with a straight face such lie that golden dawn was normalized by media
People are quick to forget the awfulness of terror groups in Greece,while putting forth a boogieman of neonazis
Thankfully we dont have neonazi problem in Greece
One dead man wont change that fact
Even if for a sort period a questionable party like GD got some seats
I think its disingenuous to minimize the dozens of victims of radical left terror,while making a false narrative that a dead rapper means a hitler is coming in Greece
Its such a obvious false narrative
Predictable
Just because i dont buy Antifa 's bullshit,that dont make me a golden dawnist
Nuance is not a word these knuckleheads understand
"If you are not with us you are a nazi" . Ahm,no
I can be against both,thank you
Now go back to your safespace
Sorry,you are wrong
Here you go then
23 victims
5 people dead, 1 cop dead,and surely a couple more i dont remember
I guess you were abroad when Themos Anastasiadis hosted Germenis on his late night show, published fake news of the Golden Dawn lads who protect grandmas from immigrant thieves when they go to the bank or when lifestyle shows talked about Kasidiaris with the swastika tattoo like he was the new hot guy in town
Neonazis are not a "boogie man" because they are real
They repeatedly attacked people, they killed 2, they had informants in the police and they felt so comfortable and protected by the police that when the murderer of Fyssas was being arrested he told the officer "I'm one of you". If you think that it's just one dead man I suggest you read their case file to see what other charges and convictions they have on their backs like the murder of Shehzad Luqman, the almost murderous attacks on Egyptian fishermen while they were sleeping in their home, various attacks on political opponents, the fact that they had a massive armory which was "safeguarded" for them by a policewoman who **still works for the hellenic police** etc
The fact that the murder of Shehzad Luqman, which precided that of Fyssas, wasn't widely reported or discussed by the media nor were the pogroms in the center of Athens when instead they interviewed GD party members as "indignant residents of Agios Panteleimonas" who are tired of immigrant crimes in their neighborhoods along with the fact that after 7 years of trial you still think that it was the murder of just one man proves exactly my point on how the media whitewashed neonazis
How can *you* tell me with a straight face that it's bullcrap and that we don't have a neonazi problem
You only perceive as a problem only what agrees with your narrative it seems
*That* is disingenuous
"Radical left terror" and you dare to speak of boogie men lol
Κόψε τον πολύ ΣΚΑΙ
You're very clearly some kind of altnright winger based on all the comments I've seen your make on this thread
All this long tirade about "nazis"
Meanwhile the left:
23 DEAD
(excluding the 5 dead of the last 7 years from other radicals)
And thats one organisation
There were a couple more dead from different terror groups
But noooo,we dont want people to learn about that,but yell about the rapper one idiot killed
alt n right
That dont sound so bad,i might adopt it
No comments on the actual "tirade" by the man who spent his afternoon whitewashing neonazis - without quotes
Since I'm not a 17N apologist you could have sent me a link for your favorite cookie recipe and it would have the same effect
When on the day of remembering 17N victims I come with comments about how it wasn't really a terrorist organization or how the victims had it coming you are allowed to come back with your 17N wiki article
Until then your link isn't an argument
>But noooo,we dont want people to learn about that,but yell about the rapper one idiot killed
Yeah, 17N is such an obscure organization, nobody has heard of it, no one spoke about their attacks
Nobody in the world has ever seen reports on the cars burned by anarchists
Thank you for bringing that to our attention
I was living in the dark all this time
I got tired of hearing Shehzad Luqman's name on TV while they so cleverly hid 17N under the rug
The Greek public is clearly so well informed about Golden Dawn which has been around since 1980 as well as their ties within the police
So much airtime spent covering the trial - not just when Magda Fyssa throws water bottles at the murderers of her son who shout "Where is your Pavlos now
"- whereas no one dares to speak about Exarchia on the news :(
I don't do drugs but I'm always open to the opportunity of exploring alternative realities
Thank you for this
I'm sorry for my previous tirade, next time I'll exclude facts to make it easier for you to defend your insane position
Funi
There was nothing for me to comment
I posted an actual list of actual victims of terrorists and you went on and on about how neonazis did this and that
The truth is they just have not had much action in this country
You simply do not want to accept that fact
One dead man and maybe someone else,we do not know for sure
Yeah,ok
Since 1980 according to your own words
Thats hardly a killing spree,is it
Meanwhile a pile of bodies ignored from the other side
Why is stating the facts about violence in this country whitewashing neonazis
This is all tiresome,and disingenuous
Its not like people cannot see the obvious efforts to minimize the violence of far left terror groups,and what better way to do that than point to neonazis
Really sad,and predictable strategy
If the violence was coming from neonazis we would also condemn them,as we condemned the killing of Fissas
The simple reality is violence was coming from the left the 40 previous years
I see
You are not delusional, you just refuse to take in any information that contradicts your opinions
I can't help you with that
Lukman's murder is not a maybe
They were convinced
It's on Wikipedia too
I went on and on about nazis under a post about the very same nazis with the guy who went on and on under the same post saying that neonazis don't exist
It's sad you can't see the irony
Καταλαβαίνω τη δύσκολη θέση σου, συνέχισε να πετάς την μπάλα στην κερκίδα με τη 17 Νοέμβρη την οποία κανένας δεν υπερασπιστηκε σε ένα ποστ που αφορά τους νεοναζί τους οποίους εσύ ήρθες εδώ να ξεπλύνεις με πάθος. Απλούστατα δεν θα σου κάνω τη χάρη να μιλήσω για αυτό που εσύ μου υποδεικνύεις επειδή δεν θες να μας πεις ανοιχτά ότι γουστάρεις Κασιδιάρη και το πας γύρω γύρω ότι και καλά σε πονουν βαθιά οι Αξαρλιαν και τα θύματα της Μαρφιν.
Έλα σε καμία βδομάδα να σχολιάσουμε τις προκλήσεις των γειτόνων και παρακάλα να μην τα ξεθαψουν αυτά από το ιστορικό σου γιατί κανένας μας δεν θέλει να μας συσχετίζουν με τις πλυστρες του νεοναζισμου.
If you want a boogieman to feel threatened by,go ahead and believe neonazis are about to get you
You are far more likely to be a victim of "accidental" burning by one of your own anarcho-fascists sympathizers
And yes,you do not have the courage to admit the violence that the far left terror groups have done and is documented
And the anarchists are well know to publicly expressed sympathy for 17N terrorists in this country
But you are trying to hide behind accusations that i am trying to wash-off neonazis
I denied that every time
You simply cannot accept that the side you sympathize with has sympathized and enabled a terror group that was active for decades and costed many lives
You simply wont accept that your side was in the wrong and perpetrator of violence which cemented the opinion of the large public in this country that the far left are simply criminal thugs that support terrorists
Nothing more needs said
>of your own anarcho-fascists sympathizers
> You simply cannot accept that the side you sympathize with
Oh, you know me so well
>I denied that every time
Oh did ya
Was that before or after you whitewashed them
>You simply wont accept that your side was in the wrong and perpetrator of violence
Says the person who literally got triggered και μας έπρηξε τα αρχίδια όλο το απόγευμα because people *dared* to mention the crimes neonazis committed
I AM NOT DEFENDING CRIMINALS YOU ABSOLUTE DIMWIT, THAT'S YOU
***YOU***
Say boogieman a couple more times kai min ksehasis na tous valeis kai loulaki
>Nothing more needs said
Indeed
looks like a warzone
Look how beautiful this is
Thousands of people spreading COVID like there is no tomorrow
Brilliant
i notice most of them are women,interesting
maybe the rumors are  true
the rumors that police picks men and arrests/beats them up so mostly women protest atm
Nice
Shall we take a moment and appreciate the 2 wonderful flags that OP (I presume
) made
This is a deja-vu in my Greek eyes
I remember Tsipras saying "we voted to end austerity, the EU must help" and the response was unsurpringly the same as now "nope, sorry". It really shocks me that British politicians are so out of touch (unless they're faking)
I just saved it in my favorites
Loved it
I'm Greek, can we please not go back to 2015 please
Everyone in the west: "oH mY goD thE bAlkaNs aRe soOO tHiRd woRlD" Meanwhile Germany:
Edit: Stop taking this seriously I made a joke no need to get offended
I mean, isn't their election coming soon
Turkey is no different than Nazis before ww2
>No denial of genocides and massacres: This includes attempts to deny or otherwise minimize crimes against humanity that are widely recognized such as genocides or massacres (e.g. the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide, etc)
Denying the fact that these events occurred or trying to justify them will result in a ban
It's not like before erdogan turkey was a shining example of foreign (and internal) policies
Sure the current situation is highly critical and volatile but they have done shit like this in the recent past
China and India destroy the environment
Europe is the most environmentally friendly continent
If you wanna help the environment then ban imports from China/India
Come to the EU before the EU comes to you
Still waiting on that Rule34 content chief
Constantinople in 1453 if the 4th Crusade never happened
This would be Greece if Greeks cared about the country's fucked up state as much as they care about Macedonia's name
Meanwhile lobbying is a thing on other parts of the world
Hey
We're making progress
Kind of
I left my food on my plate to upvote this
You're not
Greece is not Balkans
He who laughs last, laughs the longest
We'll see whose laughing in 50 years
Well spotted from superior Swede
Gah
*stares silently at everyone else looking at me*
*finally decides to respond*
hey, don't look at me I would take action if I could
Nobody seriously listens to teenagers tho so
That's unlikely
Honestly, this
Fuck that hit me hard
A wall in Athens said it best some years ago: "I either want less corruption, or more opportunities to participate".
Hold up
I do agree that 'Russia bad' but it's probably not in your best interest to talk about embarassing ww2-era moments, ey mr neutral
Can someone from Poland why you don't like te ruling party
Os the economy bad
Are you afraid to go outside at night
What's the problem really
Wow, I don't even have to add anything,  that's pretty much it
in Greece we don't just have socialist parties
we have a proper communist party whose goal is to remove all democratic processes and establish an authoritarian regime like those of the good old days
Well ok, it"s pretty accurate, but here the most left parties are called, universally (at least in my country) what they actually are: communist, not socialist
This is so damn accurate, the Greek parliament was exactly like this until the most recent election
Thankfully, people voted the actual nationalists

Ah shit , here we go again
Didn't that guy ruin your country
Because people obviously skipped history class or weren't paying attention during the lesson
Ah, I thought this was some alt-right party that praised Mussolini like people do with Hitler
Didn't realize it was his descendant running for office
This, and the Germans also had a hard time in Crete, dudes would literally butcher them as soon as they touched the ground (probably another reason the Germans were late to the Eastern front)
Yeah, well praising someone who ruined your country would be more stupid than voting for his great grandson

A large crowd has gathered outside the court ahead of verdict in Golden Dawn trial
Protesters chanting “Nazis in jail
The people demand it
BREAKING:Greek court finds Golden Dawn party guilty of running a criminal organization
Historic decision
Edit:The moment it was announced to the crowd
Golden Dawn has found guilty for Criminal Organization !!!
Their Leaders are gonna die in jail
ALL GUILTY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Auta maresoun
It's good to see our people finally stand up for something
Golden dawn neo nazi voters must be *Fuhrerious*.  /s
As a Greek these does make me happy, so many negative news the last couple of months/years
One of the few days in the last 10 years I've been proud of my country
For once I'm proud to be greek
They have been declared guilty of being a criminal organization
Fascism has many heads, but this one is finally after so many years, severed
Today is a good day
Ban Fascism  100
Anti-fascist raids 50
Was there, got tear gassed
2/10
You can trust us to do the right thing with everything except money lol
The court will issue a landmark verdict on whether the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party elected in parliament from 2012 to 2019 operated as a criminal organization
LETS GOOO
>Their Leaders are gonna die in jail
Oh my sweet summer child
Hell yeah
o laos apeti,
i nazi sti filaki
Sending neo-nazis to prison
GD even at it's peak never got more than 7% of the popular vote
The only reason they got the seats they did at parliament is because most people only vote for the 2 main parties so they snack in as "3rd most voted" with only 7% of the votes
Most of the people who voted for them were voting for them as a punishment for the previous government, that was the motto that they used mostly in their early campaigns "We will punish those politicians who wronged you" once they got voted and showed their true neo nazi colors then this latest election they got almost no votes and got kicked out of the parliament
Now followed by this
Golden Dawn had been around and was not getting more than 2% until they portrayed themselves as the ones who would "punish the previous ones for their crimes against you"
[In the latest elections Greece along with Cyprus (majority greek ethnically) had the lowest votes going to far right parties in the whole of Europe]
Don't worry about Greece regarding fascism, it will never be tolerated by the people
Greece culturally in it's vast vast vast majority from old people to younger people is based on Antifascist ideals
Odds are they were the paramilitary group for some party until they saw an opportunity to become a political party
Antifa literally stands for antifascism, it's not a left wing extremist group
If you are against the idea of antifascism, then you are considered a fascist (spoiler: you are not so democratic)
They were jailed for murders not their opinions
Many believe so yes
I think that's a little high, but I believe the polling stations that served mostly police and army regularly polled above 50% in favor of the fascists
Which isn't that surprising tbh, since those are exactly the kind of people those institutions attract
That's a bit high but it's no secret that a lot of them did
Probably they were sad about the news
[Just scroll down the pictures in the article if you can't understand the language, it will give you an idea why]
Many believe Golden Dawn had a large support in the police force
Idk if it's that or that Greek cops are cunts in general
According to sources masked men attacked the police with bottles molotovs and iron staffs
Η στιγμή της ανακοίνωσης: «Η Χρυσή Αυγή αποτελεί εγκληματική οργάνωση».
Χαμός από τον κόσμο.
Και μέσα σε 15 δευτερόλεπτα η αστυνομία αρχίζει να ρίχνει νερό στους συγκεντρωμένους!
The moment of the announcement:	<Golden Dawn is a criminal organization>.
Chaos from the crowd
Within 15 seconds the police starts shooting water at the crowd
*I would interpret that as the crowd goes livid after hearing the announcement
Greek justice system: Couple years of house arrest, best I can do
Jail can be a dangerous place for them, you know
Crimes,murders,dozens of racist hatred crimes
The list goes on
Jail is not a dangerous place for nazis
They will be guarded by people who admire them
Murder, hate crimes, attacks on immigrants and other people
They were convicted as a criminal organization
The people who started the trouble in the protest have or will be apprehended
We have a very capable police force
The trial was for a neo-nazis group that was proven to be a criminal organization
They committed murders and hate crimes
Oh they are definitely guilty
The thing is it's Greece so you never know what happens with so much corruption
Exactly
They were not tried for being nazis
They were tried for running a criminal organization in order to commit crimes
They claimed that the didn't do any of these, but the evidence proved otherwise
The protest was mostly peaceful, the police started throwing chemicals and use water hoses against the people gathered
The people aren't stupid to just sit and take it
Yes, there may be people with extremist views on the crowd that would have reacted against the police in a violent manner
But there is no way to prove that they are part of antifa
Well for starters because you probably mean "murderers", asking for murders in jail is a bit too much
Isn't the actual answer extremely obvious
Because context matters
They served their purpose in past elections, now they can be dismissed
> You must be proud
Fuck Yeah
We kicked the fascists out before and we did it again
Only this time we didn't let things go far
Yes, they are
So let’s hope justice prevails
No, because they are not trying to cause a state of terror
They only want to fight the police
At least that's what they do here in Greece
Yeah, I’ve been following the live stream online
It’s insane
But I’m relieved our judicial system did the right thing for once
Parties of hate speech lead to parties of murder
They wouldn't be able to cause a state of terror even if they wanted to
The best they can do is keep occupied a part of the police force for a few hours
They are not organized and they don't have a higher purpose than to get in a fight with the police
What you say it's antifa, it's not what you think here
Here these are the anarchists and the people against those in power
I am not defending terrorists
I am only trying to explain to you that antifascism as an ideology is not a bad thing
Yes, I agree that many terrorists have embraced it
But there are also many normal people, centrists and some who lean towards the right that are antifascist
Firstly, not all members may not have participated in the murder but almost all of them had committed crimes
Secondly, ok call antifa a terrorist group
But as long as you are against fascism and any form of oppression I won't mind

Maybe the Soviets shouldn't have advanced to Berlin after all, if the people that grew up in an age of mass disinformation and twisted truths to suit one big regime's interest over the others(cold war) can't understand propaganda from reality and start spouting nonsense whenever they see a hammer and sickle or a hint of Soviet history on this damn sub

I went for some food with the family with the same price per person
We had a blast
As a local, I can say that we like to sit at the beach for 10+ hours at a time
We will eat there, read a book, swim, chill, everything
I am sure no person in earth finds sitting down in the bear sand with no shade for 10+ hours remotely pleasuring
But if you live close to a beach and go for a quick splash and dash, then no problem with that
Don'e even think to mention to set up your own shade and shit, you need a really big car for moving the shit
We had a really nice food at a taverna actually
We got 2 pork chops, salads, potatoes, tzatziki, and the like for 4 people

Use sunscreen and fans
Don't forget that the PC will make any room that it inhabits instantly like an oven
Also, personally, if I'm home I roll just underpants, or if I'm completely alone fully nude
It won't be  45° all day
If you are home at noon just stay inside and don't do anything particular until the sun gets lower and temperature falls a bit
45 ain't a thing if you have AC
If it gets that bad I'm sure my proactive industrious belgians will buy them
Also a belgian friend (Brussels) yesterday sent me a pic of him just trying to sleep with a beer nuzzled between his neck and shoulder, was hilarious
Personally I won't even turn on AC before 36-37
House has a good airflow meaning constant draft
We use to have a nice small  open space to park our cars in my home town

Of course you'll be downvoted, you're welcome
Greece was probably trying to get a loan again and didn't make it in time
Conveniently missing out Greece
This is Nazi propaganda redrawn
The issue isn't that you can't be OK without the EU
As you just said, Norway and Switzerland disprove this
The issue is that the UK is ripping itself apart from the EU overnight, slowly heading towards a no-deal scenario
The UK would probably be fine if it gradually removed itself from the EU institutions, but under a no-deal scenario there is no room for any transition

Although he has a tendency to act aggressively to other characters he encounters (in particular Italy and Japan), he can sometimes show a kinder side to his personality

You are right the post is wrong
If it weren't for Macedonia, wither the UK or Germany would have their flag on Greece
However, countless Macedonians (mostly who live near the border) cross everyday to come shop here and what not
However, I have met quite a few Macedonians on the Greek islands and so forth (along with other Balkaners)
I honestly think it's silly that the Greek government is counting the Macedonian border crossers who come here for less than a day to shop/visit as actual tourists
I  thought it was like , some obscure isolated farmland in malta
And then there's us Greeks joining in the fun

Social credit scores
That sounds dystopian
An example
That's bank credit score not social credit score
It's about your financial situation, while social credit score, I imagine it would be something you'd be granted for doing some socially good deed like cleaning up a beach
Banking or not, it is financial related
It has monetary value
Social credit score though sounds like "good boy points" that if you don't have enough, you'd be faced with social exclusions
No good financial score might make a bank not give you a loan but no good social score might not allow you to visit a museum
That's the difference
I am not belittling it
It's just not the topic here
It's something else entirely
Let me make an example using Trump
He is a billionaire, right
Well his social credit score would still be sub zero
Like after getting banned from SOCIAL media ot would have been reflected very badly in his SOCIAL credit score, because that's what social means
Your social situation, and it's not only tied to your financial situation but also to what this AI or whoever would keep track of the credit deems socially acceptable
I am not saying of course that financial exclusion is not bad, hell, I am a victim of it too so I know what it's like
What I am saying is that's another entirety, having a social aka moral credit score
It's very dystopian
Man, timezones must be a bitch in that area

Difference is, most of our request were reasonable to pay off the debt easier or not infringe on human rights, not a pissing contest
Sadly, tis is a matter of corrupt governments and forced outside measures , not the complacency of the average Greek, that stalls us, though when a uncorrupt government came to tried its hand, everybody of the old corrupt regime tried to sabotage it
I hope it gets re-elected, for it does a decent, if very slow, job at cleaning up and creating growth, but yes, corruption is sadly worse than any crisis
You talk about the average citizen
Sure, I tend to pay VAT and not take under the table deals, as is my moral imperative to help the valiant, if imperfect, efforts of our current governing party
However, I must state that it is not some sort of moral compromise that makes people avoid paying VAT
We have some of the lower paid jobs in Europe, but, unlike other countries with low paying jobs, we also have some of the higher prices
But let me shoot down my own counterargument, true as it is, for I do not want to blame you for not going deep enough once you found a truth that seems to justify your point of view while I myself do the same: it is true that , since the era of Simitis, corruption in this country, which already existed, raged true though everyone on the population
But while at first this was only because of ease of use, soon enough it became necessity:price gougers forced others to gouge the price, and thiefs forced people with low wages to partake
Soon, a culture of outsmarting the state was created, mostly out of a perception that the state was out to get you and abuse you, and this all lead to culturally endorsed corruption
That, I won't deny, though I will deny the fact that it is a result of bankrupcy on the people's moral faculties- for Greek culture has its flaws and advantages like all cultures, and it creates many a goods and ills we could spend all day discussing
It is this corruption the new government tries to combat and, indeed, its hard, because its culturally entrenched, and for some vested in necessity, even though everyone hates it
But here's the deal, you can make high and mighty moral judgements still, for there is truth in them, but one thing is undeniable, even if the historical reasons I stated sound as excuses:
The measures forced on Greece make combatting corruption harder, for various reasons, not easier, especially the corruption of the really rich and guilty
That alone shows that the doctor is a hack, for even if the illness diagnosed is correct, he still prescribed a harmful medicine
>What you describe is what corruption does, it corrodes people's honesty and morals
But herein lies the important distinction, its not that most people did not care or find this natural, rather, it is that they find the entity they pay taxes to evil and out to get them, and that almost no one sees returns to their taxes, they consider them going to the banks and rthe rich, so they justify morally avoiding them
Thankfully, this does begin to change, especially as things are getting more clean with the effort of the new government and more returns for their taxes are becoming apparent, but it will take time
>just that the debt problem in Greece could be solved by halving (or another number, I'm ballparking here) the amount of taxes evaded
That is true, however, itis also true that the biggest evasions happen here by rich companies, many of which are international
(The fact that a lot of them are German does not escape the worldtheory of the average citizen, though I do think its a coincidence, after all, international companies are loyal to no ethnicity)
>Are you saying the austerity measures are causing corruption
I'm guessing by making people poorer so they cheat more
There is that, coupled with the elimination of a strong middle class, people most likely to pay taxes and force others to, but it does not end there
In order to crack down on corruption, money must be diverted on restructuring the services that do this job, be it getting taxes, finding tax evaders, or finding other illegal economy hurting practices, such as overworking the workers
This requires money for policy and hiring, but the EU tends to advice "no invest, only cut", not allowing such things to happen even under foreign observation
Our new government also meets resistance, which can vary from lukewarm to strong, each time it tries to ease the way the taxes are repaid in order to raise the willingness of the people to pay them
Simpler is the fact that paying taxes here are a nightmare, especially on a hot summer or cold winter, because stupid and antiquated infrastructure means you have to go to the building you have to pay, and wait for a long time behind other people, although, again, the new government tries to remedy it, easing it would take money
After that is the fact that, every time our government tries to make paying debts back easier (with, say, giving people the option of multiple payments), it is met with resistance and complains from the outside EVEN THOUGH it results in more money being paid back than there otherwise would
In other words, we lack people and infrastructure to lessen corruption, leaving us solely with the intentions of a well meaning but unexperienced government, as every more experienced one willingly perpetrates corruption culture, trying to solve unsolvable problems by overworking itself while the poor get poorer and the middle class dissappears
If not for the fact that they managed to make some profit to divert out of nothing but well meanings and hard work(as I said grossly unexperienced yet our best alternative, even though few seem to appreciate this) we wouldn't have the economic growth we have now, but instead the memorandum would have pushed us further into poverty and debt
[The picture was made here lol]
I'm amazed they even have swimsuits up there
I found what this place looks like in the winter: [link]
Im not that informed on the matter so if someone could tell me how long they stayed up there and if it was a decent amount of time, how were they fed and basically taken care of ?
They will die if left for a long time in space
As a Greek it is always fun to joke with my international colleagues how something is Greek to me (when I'm an expert or I can fully understand it)
"I am french to the conversation" sounds so sophisticated tbh, good job Turkey xD
My favorite one
WAIT, hold up, i just saw Germany
now it's close
Chinese  Greek
I am now curious to know what the Chinese expression is
In Greek another common thing to say is "alaburnese" (αλαμπουρνέζικα) instead of Chinese
I looked up the etymology, apparently it's from "Alla burla" or "Alla burlesca" in Italian and means "as a joke". Also we say akatalavistika (ακαταλαβίστικα) which means "non-understandable-ese"
Funny because greek are the base for some of these languages
[actually a constructed language in its own right]
I remember the same panic on the other side of the pond when Trump passed that law that would (reportedly) killed net neutrality

Nope, repealing NN is a huge game changer
For the US, the point of repealing NN was to allow big ISPs like Comcast to make their services super-fast and extort any competitors
If Comcast wants to make a shitty Netflix or Youtube alternative that can't compete, they will either slow down the competitor to semi-unusable levels, or force them to pay up
Nothing "major" will ever happen because ISPs don't want the public to know what they are doing
Are they against it

I just realized that all these technologies (toxic chemicals, flamethrowers, planes, tanks, machine guns, etc) were relatively recent when WW1 broke out

Maybe the trick is to make them narrower, so that cars don't fit to park
This is the case where I live, and I've rarely seen cars parked on the bike lane
However, it is a suburb
A city center is a whole different story
I guess the actual solution to this would be to discourage people from using their cars to come into the city center
Are you sure Berlin is not a city in Greece
Western Civilization in its finest
Greece here, we have 500 cases/day, up from 1 or 2 in March
Everyone is wearing masks everywhere, though I live in a big city that has single-digit cases per day
Maybe people in the country are being dumber than city people, because that's where most new cases are concentrated
No offence but that might be the dumbest thing I've heard today
Uk: WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS
Edinburgh: *SCREAMS IN GOTH*
After a trip to the Greek Aegean islands I left Edinburgh never to return
Sorry not sorry
I spent a year in Glasgow and the first time in Edinbruh I am with a friend walking around the city and  after about 3 hours of walking we realised that we have been in that spot again (I think we were in front of that parthenon replica building)
so we ask a local if there is something more we could see
we're telling him we've been to the university campus, the castle etc
and he tells us that's pretty much all there is
elated I spent my year in Glasgow

Does Taffo mean anything in Italian
Cause in Greek τάφος (tafos) means grave
Τελεταί Μπούκουρας
Fun fact taffo means grave in Greek
In Greece -Τελετέ Μπούκουρα- (a greek funeral service) has towels for the beach that looks like a coffin
His name in greek means grave (τάφος) btw
I thought it was pretty funny because in Greek "tafos" means grave
So why have they achieved meme status in Italy
Well, he definitely picked the right job with a surname like that lmao
It would be a very big coincidence if it didn't tbh

Except the highways where the quality of road is similar to Autobahn

In Greece tho these roads are for cyclers

Never been there, but I have a feeling that Montreal's awful would be state of the art in Balkans
I would feel home in Ukraine too

Really cool, what does the notebook say

Agreed
I felt like especially the greek one was just packed full of as many stereotypes as possible and mainly how a tourist would see us
But then again, if these were more normal-looking they would probably look the same for every country
The differences aren't *really* that many
This is weirdly cryptic and romantic at the same time
I like it
I'm Greek, I visit sifnos every year and I have family there
I really liked the Greek version, i didn't see anything wrong with it
I am Greek and I live in Greece and that picture was a massive stereotype
Don't get me wrong, they were all things that some Greek people do I guess, but that is *not* how a young woman's room would look like (I am a 20 year old woman for context)
No one just keeps tsipouro in their bedside table unless they are expecting friends over for drinks, but again tsipouro isn't popular amongst young people
The religious icon is an old-person thing, again
Most young people aren't very religious, and don't care about icons
The κομπολόι (beads string) is something that only old men use
The vasilikos plant is not very common for people to have at their homes, and if they do they are at their balconies or yards - not their bedrooms or offices
Cigarettes aren't as common with younger people either
It's mostly older folks, but it is on the decline with them too anyway
I found the frappè to be accurate/typical of greeks (especially while they are studying like the girl in the painting)
The appearence and clothes of the woman were also pretty typical for a greek woman
Generally it was like a collage of stereorypical or famous greek habbits, most of which would not have veen picked up by a young woman and if they were, they wouldn't have been at her bedroom
That is not how a typical bedroom or office would look like
Idk, maybe it's because I have more of a city experience than an island one
imagine being so out of touch that you are intimated by the truth spoken by a teenager
just give a jolly answer to a jolly question :)
people should thrive on the smiles of their neighbours
This is like everyday here in Greece, but people always talk or shout, shyly or not, but you won't believe how often I've been witnessing people of all ages shouting angrily at the driver to open the door on the back when he doesn't, and usually the driver doesn't give a shit
Most recent one was a middle aged guy who, when the door he was at didn't open, he started shouting οδηγέέέ, την πόρτα πίσω! (Which means "driveeeer, the back door
", by the way)
In other cases, people may even shout something like "εεεεε!" to get the driver's attention but then not say anything else unless the driver doesn't care
But of course the driver didn't open the back door for that guy and then I'm pretty sure I heard some cursing from him
But eh, it's Greece, who expects any organisation whatsoever anyway
Yeah islands are perfect for a holiday, and Athens is good too, but if you live there all your life, it's easier to notice the negatives :p
Yeah I think you're right
I haven't tried living in another country to know for sure but that's what usually happens I guess so yeah :p

The r/atheism user woke up groggy next to his 6 pack of empty Mountain Dew cans
He lifted his 400 pound frame off his bed wondering how many women he’d be able to harass on Xbox Live today when just then he remembered: today was the day
Today was the day he would finally get a chance to debate Christian sheep and slay their god in heaven
Excitedly, he got on his disability scooter and then into his 2007 Toyota Corolla
He drove to the hospital, scoffing every time he saw a crucifix bumper sticker and made sure to situate his fedora before he got out, parking in between two disability slots
When he entered, he got his camera ready, and going up to the third floor he thought “Reddit, the last enlightened place on Earth, will finally give me the attention I deserve and recognize me for my intelligence
” He entered into the room where his grandmother was lying and drawing her last breaths
A priest was standing next to her along with her children and grandchildren, anointing her and hearing her last confessions
“This is it,” he thought, “this is where I own those religiotards and achieve victory for atheism
” He boldly walked right next to his grandmother’s side and just as the priest said “may God bless your soul,” he bravely rebutted with “but there is no god to meet you in heaven
None of it is real
Your sky daddy won’t save you this time
” His grandmother looked on him in shock, opening her mouth
But then she slouched and a long beep was heard and her mouth remained wide open
“Yet another victory for atheism,” he said, looking at his family members who were stricken with faces of horror
“I’m sure they’ve finally realized their God is dead
” He opened Reddit, excited by the prospect of the karma he was going to get by posting the video he took on r/atheism
Yeah that’s why countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia are so poor ahahaha *oh wait*
[Wikipedia] says it has 9921 inhabitants
I don't believe it
There is a myth in Greece (I doubt that this myth is old though) that when the Megareans left Greece to establish Byzantium, later called Constantinople and now Istanbul, they asked the oracle of Delphi where should they go to build their new city
She told them across the land of the blind
So they left and after some time they found a city that was built on a shore, across a very beautiful place
The Megareans wondered why this colony was built opposite the beautiful place and not in it, and they thought people who built it were obviously blind
So they understood the oracle, and built their colony in this place instead, which was called Byzantium after Byzas, the name of the Megarean chief
Yeap that's right

I don't wanna spoil the fun here but that's not the original though
It misses some part from the beginning and the ending line is from entirely another quote
by Karaiskakis again but it was something he said at another time

Fucking Legend
A lot of people ask greeks how far back we can go in time and still understand our language
This is what we mean when we say "depends on the text"
100 κιλά έκαστος τότε....τωρα;;
He was the first shitposter
Karaiskakis,proud member of /r/2balkan4you
Daaamn that's my name and I've never thought of that
The son-of-a-bitch part is also based on how he was born
His father, an armatolos (mercenary in service of the Ottomans, initially at least) called Karaiskos, raped a nun who became pregnant
She was shunned by her monastery as well as the populace for being pregnant, so she developed a cursing habbit as a defense mechanism
She ended up giving birth with the help of shepherds
Meanwhile, the isolation caused her cursing to become even filthier, and as a consequence it was passed down to her son, hence why he'd curse as filthy as he did
His last name is also part of a wordplay the locals did to belittle him, they called him "το καραϊσκάκι"/"to karaiskaki", or "the lesser/small Karaiskos", the -aki suffix used in the same way you refer to something that's a scaled down version of the real thing in Greek, in a diminutive way in his case
He made it his own though instead
A nickname of his, "Ο γιός της καλογριάς", is based on his mother, as it translates as "the son of the nun".
Can you find it in the linked archive
There's nothing similar in that date
"LISTEN HERE YOU LIL SHIT"
He pressed the report button for hate speech
That is generally how revolutions roll out tho
The Ottomans occupied us for 400 years doing a lot of atrocities in this time frame
They commited a genocide against Pontic and Anatolian Greeks 100 years ago
They invaded Cyprus in 1974
Erdogan threatens us with war every month,they tried to send 4 million refugees through our border (they failed),they invade our waters and airspace every day and for some reason they believe that Greek islands being Greek is unfair lol

This letter was sent after Ottomans wanted to negotiate for peace lol
How the fuck is it Anti-Semitism when he is talking about people that are his enemies
With that logic he is also obviously anti-muslim
He refers to Mahmud II specifically
He was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire during that time
So u have chosen fart balls
The letter
Yes
Always has been
400 years of oppression, suppression of language and religion, as well as a constant reminder of the utter humiliation that was the fall of Byzantium for Greeks is an indicator of how much we wanted to get rid of them from our land
The ottomans were the sick man of Europe and desperately tried to contain the situation with extreme measures (like the massacre of Chios)
Yes, exactly

Quick question, what's the impact of nuclear power generation to the environment compared to fossil and coal
Jesus Christ Poland
France is uhm suspicious
You are absolutely right
Its mostly lack of political will
Although the biggest technical hurdle is the lack of energy storage and the long distance from the rest of the European grid which Cyprus is not connected
Perhaps when the [EuroAsia Interconnector] is completed, more renewable capacity will be able to be added to the mixture without creating problems to the local grid
I mean shit man, look at the Netherlands, far more economically advanced and they look similar, if not worse, than Cyprus from this graph
I'd argue that it's even worse for a rich country to be generating their power like that, yet no mention of them
I don't think you understand how big an investment it is for poorer areas to get into renewables and how long it takes to pay off
The EU's relative silence on this is ABSOLUTELY SHAMEFUL
Here's the opportunity of a generation to show the detractors of the European Project what the EU fucking is about and EU leaders are going to do what
Congratulate Lukashenko on his victory and politely ask him to keep it down
Throw out Belarusian ambassadors NOW
Remove Belarusian missions from EU institutions NOW
Send a clear message that until this election is re-held with EU observers in every polling station, this government in our eyes isn't the legitimate government of Belarus
EDIT: Enough with this whataboutism
Saudi Arabia, China, Turkey etc
Sure there are many awful places when it comes to human rights in the world
Can't we start somewhere
Can't we stand on the right side of history here and help end authoritarianism in our backyard **before** discussing taking our values on tour
Putin will enter Belarus and annex it any day now
If the EU was a thing in 1967, I would welcome its involvement in Greek matters to prevent military leaders from coercing the King into swearing a military government
Whether Greece was a member of it is irrelevant
Either you fight for the rule of law in the European continent or you don't.

I am glad taxing US corporations makes nationalist headlines in the Netherlands, but the same cannot be said about supporting Greeks in border disputes, or Italians in immigration issues
Don't get me wrong, regulating big data is a good thing, but it seems the Dutch only ever join when money is to be made
Big corporations want to destroy the concept of state/government so they can become a new kind of government
What google and other corporations do is known as "starving the beast", where reducing taxes paid goes beyond just raising the value of their stock
At least we fine them and get some of the stolen money back
But it's still nothing compared to the money they steal from avoiding taxes worldwide
This is common not just for businesses but for countries too by the way
Greece for instance preferred to pay the fine for having an import law that went against EU regulations and kept it because they made more money from what they had to pay
You can be immoral and law-abiding at the same time

Aegean airlines flight over the Peloponnese to celebrate the 200 years from the start of the Greek Revolution
wow a post about Greece and only 1/5 of the comments are about our debt i love this community
I thought every country had parades with petrol vehicles to celebrate national holidays
Apparently, we're the only country that emits CO2 to celebrate
Pack it up guys, tommorow's celebrations are canceled
Greece is commited to retiring almost all the lignite powerplants by 2023 and replacing them with renewable energy sources
It is also spending billions of euros to run cables to all its inhabited islands in order to shut down the oil powered generators that currently supply them with electricity
So can you please stop whining about 1 flight buring the 200th anniversary of my country pretending as if it is going to have any impact whatsoever on the environment
Greta in shambles
Wait till she sees the military parade tomorrow
So cool I didn’t know about the flight ,btw the exact 200 year mark is tomorrow
What a nice thing to do, I hope the comments have nothing cringe to say or virtue signal about
All the people commenting about this being a waste, you must be fun at parties
Related article "passangers complain after Agean Airlines flight took 2 hours longer from Kalamata to Athens because pilot was drunk over Peloponnese"
We pay for shit like this, for an extravaganza of celebration that people won't be able to enjoy
They have closed out the whole city center for the "VIPs" only
No thank you, I won't be a part of this forced ridicule
Celebrations like these are meant for the people to enjoy, not for charles and putin and whoever the government invited
I've come to dislike how the greek education system portrays the revolution, especially during independence day
it's a bit too nationalistic, and sometimes it's just straight up nationalist propaganda
Thanks komsu <3
Oh now i understand, love means debt in German anyway but thanks I'll pass
What do you mean probably
Lol
It's not like the planes are used for anything, not to mention that demand for fuel is pretty low right now
Edit: it occurred to me that if you people have a problem with pointless flights we should just ground our airforce that pointlessly patrols the Aegean
It would save tonnes of carbon from being released, not to mention the millions of euro we would save
You must be fun at parties
I guess we will use electric planes powered from renewable energy in 2121
Yooooo there will be a military parade tomorrow
Lets fkin goooo i thought they would cancel it cuz of covid
*Technically* the revolt first started a bit earlier with the town of Kalamata falling to the Greeks the 23th of March so it was yesterday
But the 25th has become the official date of the beginning of the revolt cause tradition i guess
We have very similar avatars, half-compatriot
Seems accurate
That seems like a proper analogy for the entire country
I would say it's the other way round
Planes are just fine, they mostly use Airbus A320
But good luck going at the gate with a one kilo overweight hand baggage without getting fined 50 euros by the sleazy employee with the weighing scale
And no backpacks allowed by the way
Fuck them
Happy revolution day for you too then
It only happened once
let us celebrate ffs
Oh and [this ] isn’t cringe
Interesting
Honestly I don't know
From what I know we even opened a new lignite power plant like last year
Shame that people won't be able to attend (I assume)
The flight company can't really "loose" your luggage unless the luggage door opened mid flight and they dropped them
The loading and unloading of luggage is handled by the airport personnel, so if your flight happened recently, you most likely have to blame fraport
Even the personnel checking your tickets and luggage at the gate can sometimes not be employees of the company
He kindly says this happened because of a once in 200 years event
Modern Sparta is not the same location
Also ancient Sports famously had nothing monumental on it, not even walls
Yes that will do :)))
We did
We are gonna close all the other ones by 2023 (that powerplant is the reason I added the "almost" )
The new one will be converted to burning renewable fuels in 2028 I think
I don't have a problem watching the parade on the TV
Yes, it's all true
If it makes you feel any better we also find our buses to be insufferable
And hey, if the dude wanted to close the shop, well that's his bad
Just go to another one
The secret Mitsotakis doesn't want you to know
I get that fear, I travel a lot between theessaloniki and Crete, sometimes with a connection flight from Athens
I have had my luggage go downstairs like 4 fours in the last 5 years and I always had that fear, I never left anything important in the luggage going downstairs, only clothes which I likely have a butt load between both of my destinations
As for the Croatian guy, I bet he was clueless (I am no expert in avionics technology but I follow some news because airplanes are magical), he boarded a propeller aircraft to get from Athens to an island most likely and said the airplane was bad, the propeller aircraft use the same exact technology as jet engines but apply it differently to better match the shorter trips and speeds they use those aircrafts for, but somehow he thought it looked shady
Agean from what I noticed event updated their wings to end with a swipe up which is a 2% fuel saving trick that had started appearing in aircrafts in the last 2 decades
(I remember this from a documentary but I did notice that every plane I boarded had had those in the last 2-4 years so they do keep up with technology
Ryanair had a similar design at the end of the wings
I'm guessing it's a couple of thousands of protesters at most versus millions of bored voters, sooooo the result is going to be predictable
I get 2009 Greece vibes from this
Santorini is overrated change my mind
Mykonos/Santorini/Naxos/Rhodes are just a no-go for me
Which is sad, considering the quantity and quality of other places and sceneries
I still don't get why we don't market our winter tourism
A shame, beautiful islands all of them, you should go
Oh don't you worry, I'm reporting in Rhodes in 2 weeks :|
Oh for like army
Good luck and enjoy it :P
From Germany
ok EU does that I mean might gived money to build roads to connect Bulgaria, Greece etc whit rest EU, but why Germany
Well thay have a point when NATO set up a puppet state within their borders
>the promotion of a democratic, rule of law,
this happens for sure
Yet why Germany feels like giving money to Serbia
The guy above said " Why does Serbia get aid anyway
" gets upvoted and all
I can understand EU giving money
Why Germany gives money to Serbia for support for rapprochement with the EU
For example
Damn
This happens in most cities

Beautiful
Oh yeah, the bears
I saw a couple of them when I visited
It was about ten years ago though
Indubitably
Does he atleast drift or do wheelies with that bike
I thought it was part of the mainland , not an island lol
The first one is wrong, everyone knows Finland doesn't exist
Fuck lukashenko
I'm sick and tired of these mother fuckers playing dictators in the 21st century
Hmmm it looks fishy to me, like it could be staged
Is there some place to verify it
I find it a little strange and stupid that they would abduct a person, while there was a camera in front of them
I don't doubt it
But those things you said are in the context of a protest, not at broad daylight while nothing of the sort is happening
What do you mean
Oh so someone is actually reporting about this incident
This is what I am asking about
I could try to use google translate if it is in Belarussian
I mean report who this specific person is and why they are abducted
What a great day
Love that these countries are under western influence and not Russian
Democracy and due process are absent today in Russia
They have a ruler
Turtledoves to be exact
Doves is just wrong
There's no such expression in Greece
Not with doves anyway
For what's worth, the phrase "με ένα σμπάρο δύο τρυγόνια" refers to the [turtle dove] which at some point was eaten regularly, not the more [common dove]
They shit all over our balconies so they can fuck right off
eat the meat
The cat is like "please let me go, I don't want to be here"
So when's the fourth one
Pro-communistic
Communistic
Ex-communistic
wtf
So capitalism
Pfffff that's half of what I need to issue a drivers  license in Greece
If we can make it, you can make it too
I hate bureaucracy
That's what happens if you want to reap the benefits but not pull your weight of your membership in the EU
Please, don't come begging in 10 years
I know
I needed two tables, two visits to the tax office and 2 to the insurance company and hours of waiting to become a contractor here
Mainly two tables were because no one would advise me correctly
Freaking hours of waiting at EFKA
We had to go there at 5 am and write our names on a list outside and then take a number of priority on the queue
They needed 30 mins to process a number due to the paperwork they had to store and fill up
They don;t just have tables, they have rooms on the upper floor
Yee the most exciting thing with Brexit for me is my brand new blue passport
Sad
Obviously I'm going a bit overboard but speaking the truth it's just the papers that are on the table to issue a driving license
Temporary driving permit wasn't a thing till mid 2020 in Greece
People were/are passing their exams and they have to wait almost 6-7 months until they can get their licenses
Though with 50euros you can bribe (close your mouth) the DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) and have your license in a week give or take
2 weeks
I'm moving to Portugal  CARALHO
200 euros is also a huge thing here (it's the norm)
If you don't pay they can fail you for virtually anything
Blinker too early, too late
And most of the examiners are old and they are used to accepting the bribes
To clarify something: the 50 euros bribe is for fast tracking the process of printing the driving license
Southern European countries are in a league of their own
You can practically leave Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus  and go to Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus
The red tape will follow you, the way of the system works, the mentality (with couple differences), the land
Bye bye Brits
Welcome Scottish brothers
From Brexit to Scotlin
Sad day
I don't really like the way the EU is going, but I do believe that the best solution is to stay in and fight to make the institution better for all of us
I am Greek by the way, so I certainly have a lot of grievances about the way Ger ... (cough, cough) .. the EU has handled things over the past decade, if not more
Almost as much grievances as towards the my own governments
This country is going to shit, isn't it
Just imagine not having these wonderful EU customer protection laws to guard your wellbeing
Why not
Assuming they suddenly all want to jump back in, what's preventing them
Nein, du
Oh yes, [mommy EU from the other's day propaganda hit piece] abuse me with more austerity
tell me what a child I am incapable of sovereignty
remind me often how dangerous the big evil world will be, if I dare to leave
Brexit well deserved tbh

Hey OP, I'm writing this in English bc idk if I'm allowed to speak Greek in the comments
I find your art excellent but when I think of an average Greek home  I think of kinda ugly multi story houses( and a view of the Acropolis for extra detail) That would be more representative in my opinion, but that might be just because I grew up in Athens
You're making us proud OP
This picture is amazing, and the Easter eggs (especially the Holy Mary pic) are quite the treats hahahaha
Love it

Tbh it's really hard to study with that weather
Στα ακουστικά ακούει yung Light φαντάζομαι
Nice effort, but an average Greek's view outside their window would be more [like this]
Thank you
You and me both
Thanks
But after posting I noticed I forgot to add an evil eye charm hanging from somewhere
so I guess this picture is only 99% Greek :p (good enough for this ol' cramped arm though)
That's awesome, I never thought about it that way but you're right
I hope more people join in, that will be fun
Thank you
Turkey is very beautiful as well and would love to see a Turkish version of this post
This would be dope
Yeah, Athens cityscape would definitely be more representative (half of Greece lives here basically) but I just wanted to draw summer stuff so I went for the island theme
Someone should do an Athens one
That's the village of Oia, in the island of Santorini
Thank you
Would love to see one of your country, neighbor
There are days that i drink more frappe than water :p
DAMELOOOOOOOOOO

but I didn't want to draw a gray city :p
There also need to be at least 1 stray dog
You're right
No it's a cig, in Greece majority of people roll up their cigarettes
Ok true
I was looking at the picture trying to figure out what exactly the scars are , and then it hit me and was like " oh
Well, better watch what you vote the next time a lunatic tries to persuade you that others are inferior than you and fuck jews
Of course Germany had the whole genocide thing
But if we ignored that for the moment, Were the bombings different
Were the German bombings worse than the later allies bombings
I am asking out of curiosity, I don't know the answer
I am not sure if morality matters here all that much (again, leaving out all the genocide stuff, or else the conversation would have no point)
Both countries are fighting a war
Germany wants to expand and the allies don't want Germany to expand because that would harm them
Indeed
Macedonia, we have a problem
The South will rise again
In unemployment
I wonder what Greece does wrong and what Greece does even worse
We do that in Greece too but it doesn't seem to work, we'll there is of course a lot of black labor because taxes for employees are ridiculous
Greece is EE and has almost the same food and weather

Yep that's correct
Basileus means king in modern Greek
However the title was used for Alexander the great and the byzantine emperors as well
It could have double meaning
In modern Greek as I mentioned is used only for king
Autokratoras is the word for emperor

Chinese government is on the way  to Belarus
Imagine if Turkey was on the map
Recently our government threw away taxpayer money to TV channels, newspapers, internet pages and blogs for the stay home ads during the Corona virus lock down
And now almost every journalist is kissing the governments ass calling out prime Minister messiah and shit, they gave money even to sites that are closed until construction etc but refused to give money to a very popular newspaper only because it's more left leaning and is constantly exposing government scandals
apparently greece went from 89 in 2013 to 65 today
Still a shitty rank for an eu nation but at least things seem to be getting better
I do not understand how we are below Poland, our press has issues true, but there is nothing even close to the blatant propaganda machine of TVP
I wonder what's the criteria
And it's not like I trust our own media, I know they are corrupt
But I also know that German ones aren't much better, from the way they covered the financial crisis
We were land of the free for you ancestors, when it was European countries that failed to provide them with a livelihood or the ability to practice their own religion
For what it's worth, the US has very few laws controlling what journalists can do
You have a very problematic perception of "freedom of the press".
Edit: let me help  [
So because we tried to reign in the the state tv and state news agency
&#x200B;
State TV and news agency having become the de facto mouthpiece of the previous radical leftist government and obviously that's all good and proper for them
New center right government tries to sort them out, and immediately they subtract points from freedom of press
Are they kidding us
These guys did nothing but glorify and worship SYRIZA and thoughtlessly reject all criticism and shamelessly attack critics, day in, day out
&#x200B;
Not really a fan of ND, but they did make a step toward freedom of press cause the State TV had become a cesspool during SYRIZA
Poor Norwegians
Do you want Greek passport to travel freely
What exactly makes a passport strong
Eyoooo what's good, Greece kicked some asses lololol

I always love seeing Cyprus in there it's like a contrast to the whole middle east haha
Wow I didn't expect Greece to be so high up
Same with Greece except with debt
I spilt my drink reading this ahhaha
Huh, classic
We love you Viking bro :P
Friends mess with each other
We love you just for calling us Hellas tbh
Why must you hurt me this way
This is not a country ranking, it's a passport power ranking
A better way to show this would be something like this:
Rank | Passport Power | Countries
1 | 135 | Germany
2 | 134 | Finland, Switzerland, Spain
3 | 133 | Sweden, Austria, Ireland, Italy
4 | 132 | Greece, Netherlands, Denmark, France, Belgium, Hungary, Portugal
etc
Can't promise anything
Hellas (Ελλάς/Ελλάδα) is what we call ourselves of course
>The wehrmacht were good actually and everything was the SS and hitlers fault
I think the *official* term is wehraboos
It often leads to "well the Soviets killed more than the Nazis" which is very very close to Nazi apologism cause the reason the Nazis didn't kill WAY more than the Soviets and didn't exterminate entire ehtnicities, is cause they lost

I love how the OP _kinda_ tried to list the countries in alphabetical order in the title, and then just said "fuck it"...
It sort of started alphabetically then he realised he missed a few countries and put them wherever on the list :P
What a horrible place
As a Greek I think this distinction is meaningless
My people weren't even the same country,  yet had coherent religion and language
They were the same people in Alexander's time, under roman control and under Ottoman control, yet you claim because there was some shuffling in the highest levels of government that somehow makes the ottomans other than the Turks
Mental gymnastics at its finest
Just no
The Roman empire had tons of ethnicities as well, yet they were all Roman, and more than anywhere else in the empire the Italians are the main 'successors' of that Empire
The Greeks are the main successors of the empire of Alexander, even if it last 5 minutes
The Mongols are the successors of the Genghis Khan's empire, the Brits of the British Empire, even though all these empires had multitudes of ethnicities and languages it's widely agreed who are the 'successors' trying to deny that Turkey is the successor of the Ottoman and Seljuk empires is just intellectually dishonest, as is denying the genocide
First 2 points are inane, but the third is funny
They are considered the successors of the Roman empire just about everywhere in the civilized world
Wait are you arguing that Italians are NOT successors of the roman empire

Classification of EU regions
our transition regions go from more developed to less
Source
Criteria
I find it hard to believe that Salonica is less developed that Chalkida or the North Agean islands
Source:
how is thessaloniki less developed
it should be blue lmao
when you're from northern Greece
I refuse
Mfw Thessaloniki is considered poor
By whom
On what criteria
Attica (the region surrounding Athens) is developed
Funny how the capital city it contains is not
How is Central Macedonia less developed and western Macedonia a transition region
Eastern Slovenia weak /s
By that time Mars would be blue too

Supposedly, it'll start making stations available in '22 or '23
I think the Thessaloniki metro was planned before the Athenian one
How come they couldn't get to Greece
Next: greek cities founded outside greece
My thoughts exactly
Maybe because it was founded upon an already existing ancient greek city

If they discover a bone we'll finally find out if the albanian claim to be illyrian is true
Imagine thinking albanians have anything to do with ancient Illyrians
Also that helmet is Greek despite being called Illyrian
Look it up
Btw why would someone be proud of being of Illyrian origin
They were barbarians
The Illyrian history is all about being defeated by the Greeks and Romans lmao
Called it as soon as I saw "Illyrian" on the title that the thread would devolve into a Kosovo struggle session LMAO
The helmet is of a Greek type, now we cannot know where it was manufactured
Also, saying that it was Greek kinda misses the point that the Illyrians were using these types of helmets as the Greeks were the most technologically advanced (''the most civilized'')
" It originated in Peloponnese, ancient Greece,[2] and was developed during the 8th and 7th centuries BC (700–640 BC)
[1][3][4] Accurate representations on Corinthian vases are sufficient to indicate that the "Illyrian" type helmet was developed before 600 BC
[5] The helmet was misleadingly named as an "Illyrian" type due to many early finds coming from Illyria
Bro I'm a communist I'm as far from a nationalism as it gets
Half the people in my friends circle are albanians I love albania
But I don't get this "illyrian heritage" stuff because there's no proof of it
And some of my albanian friends agree

Here the news said there was around 29k victims, what's wrong with those numbers
sorry for your loss
The situation has been less tragic than in other countries but still there are some tourist that arrive to the country without knowing our measures against the spreading of the virus such as when it's mandatory to wear a mask and when not
Originally , we reacted incredibly fast, cause we saw what was going on with our neighbor Italy and since it was so close to us and the government knew that our healthcare system wasn't in not way build to support a massive influx of patients and cases they shut the country down incredibly quick
So we pretty much survived the 1st wave without major "damage".
The issue however is, much like the government knew that the healthcare system wasn't build to support a hard hit from the virus they also know that Greece's economy can't support a non tourist year, so they are literally opening the country up with "restrictions" that unfortunately are just for them to be able to say "we put restrictions" but they really aren't substantial ones
So the result is, people from countries who hadn't contained the virus well at all, started coming to Greece and then the new cases started going up by the day, it's at somewhat 50+ new cases a day now and it's gonna get worse
It's pretty much inevitable
Thanks

The other day we were having a nice chat at work
I think it was something trivial about where to go on vacations and ranking local people based on hotness
We're quite the international team, so opinions greatly varied
When it came to Turkey a Cypriot colleague of ours expressed the opinion that she could never ever see a Turkish person this way, possibly never even as a friend
This was kind of shocking for us, knowing her, because she is very much a good person, and at first glance it seemed seriously closed minded, so we pressed her on it
She told us that when the invasion of the island happened, her father fled instantly and her grandfather stayed behind for a while to try to convince he her grandmother to also flee
But she  would refuse to leave her only house so she stayed behind
She was never seen again and was presumed missing by the Cypriot state
One of many civilians who were killed in occupied Cyprus
She told that that she harbors no negative feelings for those not responsible, but she wouldn't be at ease at the possibility that a Turk or Turkish Cypriot that would be her closed friend or loved one would end up being related to the people who killed her Grandmother for no reason
There really wasn't hate in her words, just legitimate concern and sadness
She even told us that she have visited Turkey and loved it, and that she is pro-unification
I always was of the opinion that the Cypriot issue should in one way or the other be over by now, but as I now understand it there is still a lot of bad blood, so I am not expecting it to be solved at least for another generation
EDIT:
Dammit this would be a fascinating discussion that I wasn't around for
So, for the record: I agree with all of you and everyone else does and she kinda does too, but for her it's also personal in a way that it isn't for me
It needs to be said however that the vast majority of Turks make reconciliation like what you are describing damn hard
You need to absolutely part with the idea that Turkey is an enlightened nation ready to examine its past or that the majority of Turks condemn these actions because they just don't. It will be generations before Turkey gets there, if at all
So for her, right now it's just bad blood - a feeling of fear and anxiety
On a followup to the above she said "Maybe I am just not ready to have to discuss with a Turk if it is moral that a Turkish family lives in the home that my Grandmother refused to leave and was presumably killed in", at which point I and everyone else knew not to push the issue further
This is a statement I definitely sympathize with even if I disagree with her on principle
Actually the Turkish army captured Greek cypriots and imprisoned them or tortured them or even executed them
IN FUCKING 1974 IN A CIVILIZED GODAMN EUROPE
Let's see if there are more Turkish spammers than people interested in the picture here, check the downvotes/upvotes
Only Turks take pride on the loss of human life
Don't even have to scroll by controversial this time
Out of curiosity ,what do most actual Turkish Cypriots think of the Turkish settlers
greetings from Athens
There were documents exposed recently stating how US was involved as well(cia & Kissinger)
Technically, yes, and then Turkey decided it's their turn to fuck shit up well after the Junta was toppled
Excuse me but are you talking about things you have no education on
The reason Greece attacked was because there was a right wing junta that was helped even by the CIA in the mid 60s-early 70s. Also even before the junta Turkey had plans to invade the island and president LBJ said to turkish president that if he attacks there will be repercussions
That holded them off until the junta gave them a free pass to fully invade and massacre civies
I understand that my country was not right but its not black and white
Even after our government became democratic, even after 40+ years of stability Turkey still has its army on the island illegaly
The only thing greek junta did is give them the perfect reason to attack
After all those years they "still need to protect their people" sure
Also since i dont think you arent very educated on the Greco-Turkish relations check the Instanbul pogroms of Greeks in Istanbul in 1953, and then come back and tell me Turkish only cared for their safety
If you want additional info check on the Armenian-Greek and Assyrian genocide in 1914-1921
But i guess a northern German obviously knows about all these aforementioned things
Shame EU as a whole didnt do anything all these decades but opted to let Greece protect its borders alone
Turkey is by far the worst NATO ally
Imagine knowing 5% of the story and expressing an opinion
Here is a more accurate account of what happened
Greece was governed by Junta (i.e., a military coup/dictatorship) at the time
They supported a coup at Cyprus, with the goal of reunification of Cyprus and Greece
Note that reunification was generally something Cyprus wanted, who was 90% greek, but obviously not in an undemocratic way
The coup in Cyprus was instigated by EOKA B, a paramilitary/terrorist organization of greek-cypriots, who also started attacking the turkish-cypriot minority
The turkish-cypriots also responded with paramilitias of their own
Note that this was not the governments actions, from neither side
There comes Turkey with a small invasion to protect the Turkish-Cypriots
Nobody really is against that, it was probably the right thing to do
Then a bunch of shit happened, that will make this text too long, but Turkey proceeded with a second invasion with the only purpose of grabbing land
They grabbed around 30% of the island and remained there for 50 years and counting
A population exchange was agreed and there were a shit ton of people that had to leave their home
Turkey also pushes people to the island to increase their puppet state's legitimacy and doesn't even operate at the best interest of turkish-cypriots anyway (see clashes between the turkish-cypriot president and Erdogan)
And then they just decided to invade 40% of the island *after* the Junta had already fallen and brings tens of thousands of settlers from mainland Turkey, why exactly
Turkey didn't go there to protect anyone and it's evident by the second invasion
Found the Turkish immigrant
You literally know only about the first invasion, right
Sad
I love how turks say Greeks play the victim when they get invaded by terrorists
You can joke about it
Fear is a mechanism that Protect us and we should listen to it
She has every right to be scared
oh boo hoo tell me where I'm wrong
Im pro EU in a lot of ways
I think my country has benefited greatly and has provided a good aid to EU too
But since i notice and criticize heavily both national actions and EU - NATO ones, i cant help but notice how no one cares about the aggressive attacks Turkey, a Nato member, has been creating for decades now
Neither EU nor Nato are reacting and the German policies are rewarding Turkey instead of helping Greece defend its borders
Everyday we see enemy aircraft enter our airspace and ships tresspass our sea border yet no one supports action because they dont give a damn
Saddening really, to see only a few countries like Italy and France somewhat supporting us throughout this whole ordeal .
Lmao and there it is, your true face is showing
You didn't answer me though
If Turkey went there to protect the Turkish Cypriot citizens, why did it occupy 40% of the island in a SECOND invasion AFTER the violence had stopped and AFTER the Junta had fallen
Yep, its even a saying in my country, about complicated things , we call them the Cypriot Issue
If my statment is too dumb then why do you even bother
What are you talking about
Are you trying to change the topic or something
There was violence and Tutkey invaded the first time, occupying 3% of the island
Then the violence stopped, the Junta in Greece fell and there was a ceasefire
THEN Turkey violated the ceasefire, invaded a second time even though there was no danger and the violence had stopped and the Junta was toppled, and it occupied 40% of the island and then settled it with settlers from mainland Turkey
All this proves that Turkey didn't go there to protect the Turkish cypriot citizens but it just wanted to occupy as much of the island as it could
Why else would it do the above when there was no longer a danger
Turkey did what it blamed Greece for trying to do and you're here lying about protecting the citizens
So stop running away from the question like a hypocrite that you are, and answer it
Why did Turkey did all these things AFTER the Junta fell
Everyone is saying that, not just me
In case you haven't noticed the entire world is against the Turkish occupation and that's why no one is recognising your banana republic in the north
This wasn't exactly a war
Per the Treaty of Guarantee, Turkey was justified in *intervening* in case something like that happened
In no case was it justified to occupy the island
That goes directly against the meaning of the treaty
Admitting that you occupied the island because you wanted it and saying that we're lucky that you didn't occupy all of it shows exactly that you don't give a shit about the Turkish Cypriots, you just wanted the island and you're a hypocrite for bashing Greece about the same thing while hiding from your country's real motives and that's why every other country in the world is considering Turkey to be the aggressor and occupier
Its amusing how for a country that's so obsessed about honour etc you're so shamelessly lying to yourself and you're afraid to admit your country's shit
I'm happy that you know all that :) I'd ask you to be a man and at least admit that you just wanted the island instead of hiding behind your excuses of protecting the Turkish Cypriots but that would imply that you have balls and well
Of course you don't care about the truth that you're avoiding to mention
How convenient eh
Sorry if my banana republic comment (for the TRNC) hurt your feelings, I understand that given your country's situation the past few years this must be strucking a chord
Lmao seriously dude
A map by some analyst from 2014
How long were you googling trying to find that
Looking at Turkey, this map didn't age well at all :')
You can tell it was before the coup and all the shit with Erdogan eh
It's telling that Greece is way more stable today even after all the crisis thing, than Turkey is
Man that analyst must be pretty embarrassed for his predictions today
Again, thanks for making your hypocrisy evident
Like I said, Turkey only cared about taking the island, not about "protecting the Turkish Cypriots" so quit your bullshit
This is why every other country is calling you out on it :)
We're fine with it
Turkey is a joke today
Keep doing what you're doing, it's working for us :)
This basically

Hello to you too Oriental sister

City at war
What, depth
I have yet to see someone in Greece celebrating the srebrenica genocide
i am honestly humbled and honored that we are the most googled country in cyprus
Is that before or after a trip to Austria, Czechia and Poland
People are getting fed up of neo-nazis ruining  society
That's some prime /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM material right there
When in the entirety of our post-1990 western world, the only extreme on the rise is the far-right, often in the innards of the supposedly "reasonable" mainstream parties (e.g. US Republicans), it's dishonest to try to frame the situation as "50/50 danger from both extremes".
I am confused by the former Yugoslavian states
Did they had separate laws, or did some states biefly outlawed it after the war and then reversed that decision

This is the first time I see anything about the Prime Minister and I don't cringe to death
The president should stroke her pussy
(sorry, I could resit)
It's either Greece or Romania that start something in this subreddit always I swear
Same just recently found out and thought it appropriate
I believe so ues
Technically true
First we get the islands
Then the cats
Why do u cringe
She sure should
Turkey
Can't go lower
No, it wouldn't, but Galipso would work, as gali is ancient Greek for cat
I can't stand him
I see everything wrong in him with todays Greece
I can't stand the bootlickers he has around him, the fascists that infests Nea Demokratia and the way he acts in general
Because they get upvotes in r/greece if they say so, and they do 24/7
Cause he's the prime minister
Galypso would sound better

practical but not really fashionable
They use a ski-lift to get to the top and hike all the way to the bottom which makes the hike more enjoyable and less tiring and timely-efficient
At least here in America I have yet to go on a hiking trail that offers lifts
mark my words folks: a day will come, when germans will not need their passport to travel abroad during summer, just displaying their long socks with sandals will be enough
Well I dont disagree with you
After all this it s a trait that people make fun of but secretly are jealous of
Practical is more necessary
I wore a poncho to a day at a music festival here in America and got weird looks
Then it started raining *really hard* middle of a concert and people were scrambling like hell
It said it was going to happen in the weather people

I am afraid it's the same way in Greece as well
You are talking in abstract hypotheticals and political philosophy
Sure, communism in its proper definition is nothing close to the socialist totalitarian regimes we saw in reality, but those regimes were the only ones to gain power in the name of "moving towards communism" And we can see now that they sucked and the few ones that didn't suck were crushed by the terrible ones (see the end of catalonia in the Spanish Civil War and what happened in Czechoslovakia in the 60s)
I believe einstein put it best honestly: "the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result".It's time for everyone to come to terms with the idea that communism has been so thoroughly tainted in the eyes of most of the public and it can't be achieved, at least not for the next 100 years or so
Regarding your first point, fair enough
Proper intellectual discussions about these topics are lacking indeed
As for your second point, I saw in the other comments that you weren't a communist, it wasn't meant as an accusation but rather a general point
At least you've got high speed internet
Imagine paying a year's worth of wages over a snake bite

I'm from Greece and I had never heard of it before
Well I am usually freezing during the 10C winter
Greece at 20°C: "It's kinda chilly today, let's wear a jacket
Around April when I kept saying to people that it doesnt make sense to blame Chi-na for this, but your governments, people kept going on about how they hid stuff etc
As we see here the US had its first cases couple of weeks after Europe in general
3 months later, they are not even close to tackling this
Considering the size of their country, one can say that California and New Jersey can be seen as two different countries almost
Yet we see this
I mean did interstate borders ever close
Cause that's a big difference
Also i like how most if not all the media blame Trump for the 2nd wave (100% at fault for the first)  whilst not even daring to mention the effect that the protests and the massive crowd gatherings may have had to this
Im sorry but putting cases in a graph is pointless
The numbers are extremely affected by how much testing is heing done
This is why im usually upset when the same people who made fun of those denying the facts about coronavirus, are now keeping their eyes shit and fear monger that the US is having a huge increase in cases where the cases are actually going down (ill explain why)
I would much rather have the graph show deaths or hell even estimations of the total cases
So far the best way to calculate the total cases was looking at daily deaths, looking at the history of the pandemic in said country and taking into account the confirmed cases
And when u say take inti account the confirmed cases, i dont mean "oh we have 4 now it was 2 yesterday so its worse". Obviously the more you test the more positives you will have
And the US did increase testing
So while the deaths in the US have gone down by a ton (considering how fucked they were) people scream about the huge increas ein cases like its getting worse when the daily deaths keep dropping, as do the cases that are in need of hospitalization
So anyone reading this, please dont feel like "oh the virus is over", but check the numbers yourself and use critical thinking
I personally live in Europe while my brother is stuck in the US (i left just before the virus, and funnily enough the first case in my state happened in the university i was going to lol)
Edit: im not defending the US jeez, i just want better stats
Sorry if i made people upset i just saw the downvotes
You are acting as if all european countries test the same, both in method and in amount
Which is wrong
"The country has ramped up testing capacity to more than an average of  478,000 tests per day in June, compared with an average of over 345,000  per day in May
" Thus by doing more testing you are gonna discover more cases
here are the stats in Europe:
(this is total, not per month)
Even when you take each country's population into account, the data is way different for each country
Hell im not even gonna talk about some eastern European countries just didnt test a lot so that their figures stayed low (not the only factor that contributed to low stats but one of them) source: [
&#x200B;
Either way though, my point wasnt to say "oh USA did better than the post tells us grrr grr
" Obviously the US did shit compared to Europe
Im just commenting on how confirmed cases alone are a bad way to measure these things
You can cut down testing and you will have lower cases
in "Europe" in the graph you mix the data of countries with good transparent data and a fuck ton of testing with countries that werent that transparent and did lower testing
Or countries that started lockdown early and those that started it late

"Forever your stars will shine on a Unified Europe
Hmm nice phrase
Let me just give it a rusty try through my ancient Greek:
"Πᾶς χρόνου ἀστέρες σοί λάμψουσιν έπί τῆς Εὐρώπης Ηνωμένης."
And in Greek:
"Για πάντα τα αστέρια σου θα λάμπουν πάνω σε μία Ενωμένη Ευρώπη."
There we go (I think)

A lot of nationalistic idiots spewing their hatred in the comments
Excellent post OP
With a bit of luck we will see a European federation within the century
It's anti democratic because, like it or not, the bigger and stronger countries have a bigger say that smaller ones
Noone in the union cares about the opinion of Portugal, Greece or even Denmark for example but everyone listens closely when Germany is speaking
Perhaps but most likely not
The EU is not built on conquest and slavery like the Roman Empire
Bad as always but there is no real anti European sentiment
All parties worth a damn are pro Europe and anti authoritarian
That is not to say that the inability of the EU to punish turkey hadn’t hurt its reputation but nothing that serious
Emmanuel macron is way more popular than our prime minister right now
Yes, that is all true
On paper that is
The views of every country are clearly shown, represented properly, discussed thoroughly and then simply ignored so that the big players can do what they want
As far as I am concerned Germany and France where the ones that wanted to open the borders of the EU to millions of unlawful immigrants because they wanted some cheap labour
They didn't give two shits about the problems that this could cause to everyone else in the union
The population of a member state doesn't mean anything
When I say "big" I mean the military power and the geographic space available to build more stuff that will make you richer
Every state has one, equal vote
When, let's say, 5 members use their power and influence to shift the entire union towards their desired outcome is no longer a Democratic system but an Oligarchic one
The USSR was also built on conquest and military enforcement
Multicultural empires have been the norm for centuries
Rome alone lasted for a thousand years and it was a lot more unstable than the EU
Once the economical crisis subsided they lost all possible support
Sadly they were replaced in parliament with a snake oil salesman with more or less the same ideas but without being openly Nazi
Still, their trial was a great win for democracy
Why isn't there any street view in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Moldovia

In the winter the snow was very bad quality in my opinion it melted easily but now it seems thicker
Well, in Greece, in Evia, there's always 1 week of snowfall that's brings snow to 2,5m in height
And in northern Greece, higher than that
Yes
And a lot of it
In Evia, an island, it snows up to 3 meters in January
And in northern Greece
In fact, just two days ago, it poured a lot of snow all over northern and central Greece
As a Greek to a Turk, let us not forget the countless villages in Ottoman times where Greeks and Turks lived at peace with one another until opposing sovereigns tore them apart
Really sad
I had a medical circumcision in my teenage years and it was so painful, it took me about a month to stop feeling that pain
Doing this on toddlers for religious reasons is inhumane, and in my opinion nothing short of torturous
Well things within the EU are quite boring so it helps breaking out of the boring routine
"Too much peace" becomes monotonous after a certain point

Argos is older than Athens, it's been inhabited continuously for the last 7000 years
That's a good question
According to wiki Argos seems to have been inhabited continuously for the past 7000 years which would make it probably older than the Minoan civilization
Maybe it's a guess that it was indeed inhabited *continuously*. Or maybe because it's so old it doesn't count as a civilization per se but just as Neolithic settlers
Not sure
It would be great his detail be like that

I think the two Greek ones should be the other way around
τ and θ are in the common Greek alphabet and extensively used, I don't know how "No" from those leads you to (common Greek) Greek
Also modern dialects in Greece all use the same exact alphabet, maybe with the polytonic system, their differences are in pronunciation and spelling of certain words
Where's our beloved letter "Δ, δ" (Delta)
Meanwhile in Greece: "Yes, Yes, Yes, **NO**"
If we were to get really pedantic, there is a word with ancient origin but used in modern ([ατθίς] that was that combination of consonants

What a load of rubbish, pointing the finger at Cyprus for using the veto in exactly the same way as every EU member in EU's history
You know very well why Cyprus is vetoing the sanctions and it has nothing to do with Belarusian regimes
Plus, this is [more than just a veto]
>After the meeting in Brussels, word got out, however, that the FAC failed to agree on sanctions against Belarus because of Cyprus’ demands on Turkey
>But Christodoulides said it wasn’t so
>He told CyBC on Wednesday that during discussion in Brussels, a number of countries backed the position that the process should be based on the political agreement in Berlin
>“Some other countries, headed by Germany, said that in view of discussion at the European Council on the whole spectrum of EU-Turkey relations, their approach, of the German Chancellor, is that this issue is referred to the European Council,” Christodoulides said
>“We said, that based on the agreement, both issues ought to be promoted to the European Council, which is what happened, nothing more, nothing less
>He said that when a state strongly about an issue it is placed high on the agenda and if unanimity cannot be reached, this is respected and consultations are promoted at the European Council
>“It is not as if there was a vote and Cyprus vetoed a decision,” he said
“In no case do we link the sanctions
In this case, there is political agreement achieved at foreign affairs ministers’ level
The sanctions on Belarus will be imposed, whether it is today or in two weeks time, that won't really make a difference
I love people blaming Cyprus
The turks have been drilling inside their waters for over a year and the EU told Cyprus to kindly shut the fuck up while sending their thoughts and prayers
What ever reasons you people might have for sanctions on belarus turkey has done worse
Baltics want action against belarus-Russia Cyprus and Greece want action against turkey
We can have both or we can have neither

This little bust is all that remains of Leopold's legacy
No other statues, no paintings
Who are they kidding
Despite that I disagree with removing and cancelling any form of art (even though Leopold is one of the few who probably deserved to be removed, from all the historical figures who have had their statues toppled), I have to call it as I see it: This is hypocrisy from the Belgian state
If you're going that way, then remove everything Leopold not just this little bust

Is this the usual thread using questionable statistics about how dumb people make bad choices and destroy the future of the redditors that all made the good choice since they are all so smart

It was mostly poor, rural, and under-educated areas that were voting for them
Don't forget greedy people
Living in the US I've heard/seen my share of rich folk who voted for Trump simply because they've been voting conservative their whole life and don't want to pay more taxes

He's going to fix our economy

Yeah while I agree that the events in Kosovo, that led to the bombings of Serbia (then new Yugoslavia), most probably were a necessary evil to remove a crazed dictator, I would like to point out that Srebrenica is in Bosnia, which is on the opposite direction from Kosovo as far as Serbia is concerned
You may think that the two events are related, but they are really not

I am sure in Croatia, there is some of this Overlap
And don't even get me started on the Baltics
No problem
The regions aren't set in stone

But I don't think eastern European is an insult

But we have to wait to learn who did it and why

There is very little you can do to ensure that you'll get a good one, just vote and hope for the best

Cool illustration, but it's a bit misleading not to include massively religious countries like  Romania, Cyprus, Greece, Croatia, Serbia, Malta and more that I probably forget
This would look very different if the balcans were included
Good fucking riddance
Can't wait to see this be the norm where I live
It's probably a good long while away though
Same with Greece and many other Balkan countries
Seems like they left out a lot of predominately Christian countries to skew the results
It doesn't include and other countries like Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Croatia, Serbia, Malta etc
Countries that are religious
I'm glad they left us out
It's kind of embarassing
At first I thought the same too, but then I noticed that they had included Russia which is Orthodox
But I'm talking about the rest of the country
86% are orthodox christians, 50% attend religious services at least monthly, 95% believe in God

It would be interesting if the tax records of the last decade, of all the higher ranking officers in those unis went public
Then we would know where all this money goes
And just to mention here that the  £9

A Master costs average  £7

Of course, a master is paid everywhere, but in the EU depending on the country it can be between zero to  €2000 per year

Αντε ρε μαλακα
γαμώτο is as mild as you get with vulgar greek expressions mate, you couldve done much worse
In Greece we say Γαμωτο/Gamoto but we also use the Turkish one, Siktir
We also use siktir in Greek although it is pronounced sichtiri
At last a map I can relate to, since I used "Γαμώτο" and plenty of its variations about a dozen times today
We also use siktir here .
Ώπα ρε, από την Τουρκία είναι το Άϊ σιχτίρ που λένε οι γιαγιάδες;
Γαμωτο is more a "damn it"
Γαμω means "fuck" so i think it's more accurate in the way it's used
Γαμώτο in Greece
LOL
Greek one's also fine
It directly translates to "fuck" (Where, more like "fuck this", but the way it's used is basically the same as "fuck")

I mean in Greece a water bottle costs 0,50€ literally everywhere, even in airports
Worst thing is that airports force you to dispose of your water bottles before check-in
I had to read most of the comment section trying to figure out if the "only 1€" reaction was sarcastic or genuine before I realized how expensive is water in some countries
Where I am the typical price is 0,5€ if you buy it from a kiosk or something like 0,15-020€ if you buy it from a super-market
As a Greek 1€ for a bottle of water seems kinda insane
I'm almost willing to bet that in popular airports, the water bottles they make you dispose of bring a really significant bit of profit
Its interesting the aviation industry to say least
Its hotter in france than italy Greece and Spain
You good
Can we switch the heat toggle off ?
Eh 30 degrees is manageable, it's not that bad
Actually these are kinda the normal September temps for Greece
Fun fact 30 is the opposite of a heat wave in Greek september
Tbh, that's not a heatwave, that's rookie temperatures
Greece is in the red and 30C is bread and butter for us, we have 30+C every day at summer
Greece: I should carry a jacket with me it's starting to get cold
I mean
it doesn't. Obviously climate change is real, but this map doesn't prove anything
Yeah, the average was 28
9, basically 29C for warmest temperature of the day in September, according to the link that you sent me
This map displays the warmest temperatures
So today it got 1C warmer than the average
Oh, what a *terrible* heatwave /s.
[Here it is from an other source as well]
In the summer months, it gets warmer than 30C *every* day with like 1 or 2 exceptions for thr whole summer

Hi there
To answer your question, I'd have to write a book
We are very big on food here and Greek cuisine is comprised of many extremely tasty local cuisines
If you avoid the touristic places (I do not mean the touristic destinations, but rather the touristic restaurants), you'll get to experience what Greek food is all about
There is a website which gradually draws the gastronomic map of Greece
It's far from complete, but you may find some interesting info [there]
Some of my personal best, based on my experience so far (there are tons of places around Greece I haven't visited yet):
- Lesvos island: It's one of the biggest producing areas of olive oil in Greece, it has a varied and extremely tasty cuisine based on local ingredients and it is also the home of ouzo
I have had some of the best and freshest fish dishes here (the island is famed for its sardines), I lost count of the local ouzo brands (there are also a couple of ouzo museums on the island) and one should definitely not fail to taste its (protective destination designated) ladotyri cheese
- Crete: Another great olive oil producing island, home to one of the most famous local cuisines (Cretan)
One shouldn't miss apaki (smoked fine pork cut seasoned with herbs), dacos salad (the tomatoes of the island are some of the most fragrant and sweetest ones), fresh local greens, hohlioi boubouristoi (pan fried snails with rosemary), goat dishes, the vinegar-y sausages and the local mini pies
The island also produces some interesting wines based on Kotsifali (local grape variety) and tons of raki
- Tinos island: The past few years Tinos has been making itself a name as a gastronomic destination
I love its artichoke dishes, its cold cuts (louza is to die for), the local cheeses and the fried tomato balls
- Volos: I'd go to this mainland port city for its tsipouro tradition (they serve tsipouro with an array of delicious small dishes - meat and fish - at low prices)
If I were interested in wine, I'd probably choose between Nemea region in Peloponnese (home to the Agiorgitiko local variety), Naoussa region in central Macedonia (home to Xinomavro local variety and host to numerous wineries which one can visit), Santorini, Samos and Lemnos islands (all three islands also have a delicious cuisine based on local ingredients, besides producing some of the most famous Greek wines)
The whole Peloponnese region is very intriguing on food terms, while Athens and Thessaloniki cities have a great restaurant scene
Crete, Volos, Thessaloniki for food, and eat everything
A trip to Dortmund costed 10 euros last week

My man just wanted to post something beautiful
You too my Sweden Friend
I sincerely hope our neighbours will vote for a secularist and Erdogan will be ousted
We could improve relations with Turkey and provocations should stop
Best wishes
Also: ^^gib ^^Asia ^^Minor ^^clay
Out of the loop
What's happening
Good luck
Hello
As a concerned neighbour, what is the opposition's stance on Greece
Some Greek outlets had reported that Erdogan was attacked by the op for being too soft on Greece
Is that true
Well the crowd is massive and i wish you the best in your campaign
I really want for our leaderships to get along and Erdogan does nothing but creating tensions
Tbh
there's nothing i want more than to see both of us working and chilling together, i mean fck the arms race let's enjoy each other for once
I think he is even worse than Erdogan regarding Greece
It's a lose lose situation for us
How about we give an islet in the ~~Ionian~~ Aegean and they^^gib ^^East ^^Thrake
Disputed territories means two countries claim the same land/sea, what do you mean by exchange
I mean more broadly like Japan/China or Vietnam/China territories
Which is why I wanted a citizen's opinion
Only once had I heard that Greece was not being discussed in Turkish politics at the given moment by a greek reporter in Turkey
Kemalists are douchebags
My flair should show why
Or India-China, or Tibet-China, or China-China2 (Taiwan)
China has no friends, does she
We still call it ''Mikra Asia'' in Greek, meaning Asia Minor
I say we should take Nikomedia as well while we're at it
For many decades it was a vassal for many actors and countries and that's not good on a subconscious of a big power, I get that they aren't fancy friends
There is a feeling of threat
Even as recently as the 1970s with the invasion of Cyprus, people fear Turkey
Many Greeks have relatives who only came to Greece due to Kemal's actions
I remember my visit in Istanbul many years ago and, in particular, the welcoming climate
The more heartbreaking part is the tendecy of association between government and people
I'm all in for secularization but damn it kinda gets personal when so many civilians died in Smyrna
On the upside tho, most of them were educated and actually contributed to Greece greatly
Countries included:
* English-speaking
* Countries they want to invade and occupy
Pff
That's ridiculously beautiful

You can't force people to be attracted to something they're not for the sake of being politically correct
Same in Greece
We even have African celebrities (athletes) who speak fluent Greek
Some were even born here and have Greek names
In Greece we do not renovate the roads but when we do we just patch some holes to become bigger in the next thunderstorm

what really pisses me off is that those who voted against the article belong to the neo nazi party we have here in greece and 1 or 2 are leftists
i expected from the conservatives in greece to vote yes because these people have 0 dignity and only exist to ruin things but i didnt expect it from the center left
im disappointed
Are the Greens any less "let's do nothing that would even remotely risk our economy" than the CDU when it comes to dealing with Russia and Turkey
And this means
So the chancellor is going to be from the green party
Basically, Germany is governed like South Korea, by the big companies which are also corrupt as Φuck
Like Siemens and her black funds, for instance
Germany's selection of refugees is strict
They probably handpicked families
Plus the stance has changed
After the arson of the Lesvos camp Germany agreed to accept 1200 refugees out of 15k. Handpicked
Nice !
Yeah but how will that affect politics in Germany
Here is more random facts for you, i guess i was wrong about the exact numbers mea culpa

I think I fell in love with a word
They hate  cause they aint
Most of Greece's debt isn't in Euros, it was almost 100% of GDP before Greece adopted the euro and it only skyrocketed because the economy contracted by 30% when no one wanted to work with Greece because of Tsipras and Papandreou
Not having the Euro actually would have worked in this case
Yea with Papandreou, Simitis, Papandreou (the son) and Karamanlis but all of Pasok (the party that basically died) which ruled for \~ 30/40 years went to Syriza
A brief explanation is that the Simitis government cooked the books with currency swaps changing the real debt so Eurostat was brought in by the EU to take over and they are still there today
Then ND is elected and they with Eurostat used the bailout funds to buy military equipment from France and Germany
Then Papandreou (the son) said ND was lying too with the military equipment which wouldn't have mattered so much to the EU since they basically made the sale happen but Papandreou wouldn't agree to bailout terms creating the mass loss of trust for Greece
That is what caused the economy to contract so much, the loss of trust hurt more than anything else for Greece
So Pasok fails to reach a deal so ND comes back accepting the terms and the economy improves a bit then Syriza comes in and fucks everything up but eventually doing everything ND was doing anyway
The whole issue is basically partisan politics, it is like with the Macedonian name dispute
ND in the 90's had literally the same deal that Tsipras made with N.M. but in the 90's ND got unelected for being "traitors" according to Pasok
Then the economic crisis happens, almost all of Pasok dies and goes to Syriza and then Tsipras make the same name deal with N.M. When the Simitis government was caught cooking the books for a decade using currency swaps, there were actually MP's from Pasok saying N.D. were traitors and stupid for telling the world about how Greece and Goldman Sachs were ripping everyone off for almost 30 years
All just so ND could get votes
Ironically in Greek politics, the left side is just as xenophobic as the right side as Pasok and Syriza both hate or ridicule Germany, the UK, France, the US etc while the centre-right side only cares about money and would sell everything out
Oh no
As I saw this map, some very warm wind hit my face
It's kinsa ominous tbh

You should add Cyprus, looks good otherwise
I can assure you Greece is not that cheerful

The comment isn't underrated
Turkey's location and shape would probably make them Mordor (it has the roughly same rectangular shape)
Plus they're many and angry :P
Guess we should start lighting the beacons
Great job OP, it looks neat
So does that mean that Greece is Gondor
I think it would match the siege of Vienna more, with the Rohirrim matching the Hussars charge that broke the siege and all
Damn, i deserve some self-flaggelation
I totally read that as Minas Tirith lol
You're right, it was a good analogy with Minas Ithil
As if this is the only '"rewriting" in the history of history (pun intended)

You aren't in western/southern Europe though :)
There have been quite a lot of maps in /r/europe about the divisions of Europe, but I'd say Western Europe is Spain at the very least
I'm sure it's easily proven that it isn't :)
Sweden should start saying it's swidiss and Switzerland should be sweesh
It tough here in Greece
Keep in mind, some taxes are payed through utility bills (ex
the electricity bill), I don't quite remember what the tax's name is
6%? Wow
I need to connect myself to reality again
I'm not in touch with almost anyone who's struggling financially **that** much and apparently that alters my point of view
Oh boy
holy fuck
Yay
first time i see my country at the top of a list
Yay we are first
hold up
Here in Greece 37% is homeless (I think) that explains it
When I saw Greece being #1 I was certain that it was about something negative
That being said these are 2018 stats and the situation has supposedly improved
Of course we’re first
Living costs compared to UK with salaries compared to Bulgaria
Welcome to Greece
Great here's something we're first at :)
We won
I want to thank Germany for helping us achieve this great goal
Greece is high because we are to lazy to go pay them
At least you guys get one of the two /s
Nah we probably shouldn't
Almost all of them live in Athens that's why
At least we have money for German tanks
Our small family business is taxed similarly at around 50% here in Greece but it's definitely not worth it
All of the downsides with none of the benefits
Edit: to clarify, income tax is not 50%. But adding up all taxes and the various government fees we pay throughout the year it does add up to around 50-56%.
I learned something new today
Thanks
Balkans stronk
I think pensioners have it the hardest
Most have had their pension cut multiple times in the past 10 years (and it will probably happen again)
Old people who don't have a family to take care of them must have it real hard
Young people have it bad too, but they manage better because they have low expectations
Example: no one expects to buy a house these days
Many boomers can't adapt to their reduced income, they're used to having a good economy
Generally unemployment has gone down quite a bit because we have seen a rise in service jobs: baristas, food delivery, etc
But you can't make a family on these jobs
For me, as I studied computer science, there is a lot of work in my field
Once I'm done with my army service I expect to get an entry level programming job
Starting salaries aren't anything special, but it's usually enough to live on your own
My mom is kind of like that
She could be more well off by 1) not smoking, which costs at least 100€/month and 2) not having so many pets/spending so much on her pets (also at least 100€/month)
Her income is okay for a pensioner in Greece and she owns the house she lives in, you'd think she would be good to go
Instead she is struggling with bills and is slowly but surely taking on credit card debt (very smart, I know)
Now 200-250€ might seem like a joke, but when you live on the line it makes a big difference
People of that generation didn't have to be so careful with money, so they find it hard to learn to do it in their 50s/60s.
People in Greece are more well off than our neighbours, but poor compared to the rest of the EU
I'd say we are on a similar level to Romania
I ride my bike everywhere, drink cheap beers in cheep bars and don't go to clubs or fancy places
I pirate a lot
Eat at home
A good day is when friends gather, we buy some good meat, cook and drink beer
Starting a family is doable, just not easy
You can't be frivolous with your euros
It really depends on your perspective
I have travelled in the Balkans and have seen that things could be much worse than they are now
The part that stings is that it used to be good, and it went bad recently
There is a persistent and pervasive cultural norm of tax evasion, favoritism, having 'backup' off-the-record money, knowing the right people in the state, and so on
This probably stems from the time of the Ottomans or even earlier
And it developed because people had to lookout extra for themselves and their families, keep some 'backup', bribe some Ottoman officials, etc
This mindset never faded, as we were pulled into modernity by western powers, instead of naturally evolving in it
We never had a Renaissance
We are at a point now where it's like a prisoners dilemma in game theory
If no one plays, we all win
But people are individually highly incentivized to 'play' and thus it's very difficult to stop
To be honest I think the only way to truly change is to have a heavily controlling totalitarian state
But that would take us waay back economically anyway so it is pointless
This is true for most Balkan countries, not just Greece, by the way
I truly believe this is the most important factor that explains why we are as we are now
We still have an outdated mindset that works to undermine the state
The rest I'm too bored to answer ;)
Yeah, Europa-girl is a fucking weeb
For fuck’s sake, is this where we’ve ended up

We actually suggested the heart between the flags too and were initially declined by the turkish representetives saying it will be difficult to maintain

Also our discord was never at war with /r/Turkey the attack was done by randoms

That's a terrible idea
Why would we make the heart the country Turkey invaded and took half of 40 years ago
As a half Cypriot who saw his grandparents lose almost everything mere decades ago this disturbs me
This wasn't the Ottoman empire we're talking about
By the same standards I can hate the Germans because they killed my great-grandfathers, but I don't. The simple Turkish people did nothing wrong
You should hate their governments not the citizens

Mythos beers everywhere
Edit: I never claimed it's a good beer, everyone calm down
To each one what they like
For some reason this post made me really sad
Imagine how much food is wasted worldwide
This is only some food from only one supermarket
Imagine how much food is wasted from every supermarket in the EU
Wait you got mythos beer there too
is that a mythos ? in poland
Mythos beers are way better than the others
Nai auto na doume sth roumania pou eixa paei eixe is grhgorh
Except for Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan
But like
why tho
The problem here is that you cannot easily transport the food from where it is discarded to where it is needed
There is a big cost involved, made bigger by the lack of infrastracture in the areas where starving is commonplace, which those needing the food obviously cannot pay, and by the time it arrives most of it will have completely rotten away anyway
People do not starve because food is wasted, they starve because food cannot get there
That's pretty good
You got it right for Ancient Greek
This is Modern Greek so the pronunciation is a bit different:
Otan to diafimize "pantou iparhi enas mithos" ke mis to koroidevame
Their old (current
) motto is "There is a Mythos (myth) everywhere
And they had ads with some people drinking Mythos in different countries
Good question, it's a bit tricky but not impossible
I'd say the most evidence we get is from how the Romans heard and wrote down Greek words: for example, they wrote "Athenai" for "Αθῆναι" (Athens), but in mod
Greek that'd be pronounced "Athine" . This means that "η" was pronounced as "e" (in fact, a long "e") instead of "i", and that "αι" was actually the diphthong "ai" instead of an "e". Now this is just one example, but you get the idea: do this with thousands of Greek loanwords to Latin, as well as to other languages, or even with words Greek borrowed from Latin, Persian, Sanskrit etc
After comparing them, you have a pretty concise idea of what anc
Greek sounded like
But there's more evidence, for example some authors have described how things were pronounced, and we even know some anc
Greek onomatopoeic words: in one of Cratinus' plays, he writes that sheep sound like "βῆ βῆ" or "vi vi" in mod
Greek
Not gonna lie, "vi vi" is the stupidest sound a sheep could make
It would make much more sense if it were pronuced as "bē bē" like in most languages of the world, and in fact it is
Or if you're not convinced just think about this:
Why would the anc
Greeks create the first alphabet in the world and instead of having 1 letter per 1 sound they had 7 combinations (ι, η, υ, ει, οι, υι, ῃ) that all sounded like "i" according to mod
Greek pronunciation
Well, because each letter indeed corresponded to 1 sound (mostly)
In fact, mod
Greek pronunciation is not really close to anc
Greek, because it has undergone several sound changes
Keep in mind that 2500 have passed since then (if we're talking about Attic Greek)
English pronunciation has changed much more in 1000 years than Greek did in 2500
But sound changes are a natural part of every language
Some Greeks have trouble understanding this, and it's even become a political game: if you go to Greece and start talking anc
Greek the way it actually sounded like, people will start laughing at you and probably call you names
In fact, we're not even taught in school it was pronounced in a way other than like mod
Greek
I only learned this when I was 16 by randomly browsing Wikipedia
If you wanna read more, [Wikipedia] is a good place to start
And [here's a video] of what we think anc
Greek most likely sounded like
If you have any more questions, just ask :)
Just like you dig out ruins every time you try to build anything in Greece, I bet in 2000 years they will dig out bicycles in the Netherlands
You can consider yourself lucky
I'd wish so but i cant :/
That's sad :(
>No wonder the greeks are so much in debt, not knowing the difference between infront and behind, probably thinking a minus in front of your financial balance records means it's positive instead of negative
Ehhh that would mean that we don't know the difference between plus and minus, not in front and behind
Just sayin
Thanks for the rest of the comment though :P

Greece is about 22-26
That could mean a country has many small schools
There are
small villages in islands in greece with 3 children
I think the maximum you can have in Greece legally is 27
My guess is that in smaller villages (which we have a lot of) there are very small classrooms which would offset the ~25-member classrooms I’ve also experienced in cities, giving that ~17 average
I’m from Heraklion (Crete) and lived there till I was 14, and I also remember classes always being over 25 kids, closing in (and even reaching) 30 at times
This average was indeed surprising

upvotes from the oceanfloor
> The Greeks got themselves in that situation by not paying taxes
Greek here
Taxes are the tip of the iceberg
We borrowed MUCH MUCH more than our GDP allowed
When we entered the eurozone, we got a bond interest rate close to that of Germany
Result: we borrowed shitloads of money
Then the time came, to pay back
> they would have been much worse off without the EU, yet all they do is complain about austerity politics
sadly true
people think that austerity is a choice, and that you can get a "good" leader who will say NO to austerity and magically the economy will spring back up, and all benefits will be restored
The myth of the moneytree that grows money: this is the current understanding of most Greeks with respect to the economy
uff, here we go again with the armchair economist one line explainers
Lmao, if you think not paying taxes creates a deficit of that scale and not bad financial decisions by the govt
The problem with Greece and EU in general is that the periphery cant compete with Germany
So Germany exports a crap ton and keeps the surplus for itself
When people realise this it will be the end of EU
Exactly, with a public debt and your own currency, you're biggest debtor is your own people, similar to Japan or the US
Not foreign banks
Yeah man, I'm Greek and work in Brussels, that shit is so funny to watch
Venezuela had a massive oil economy that collapsed that Venezuela was highly dependent on
EU is a european common market
Germany is a big country and big market in the center of Europe in a very rich and fertile land
Greece is a medium sized mountainous country in the periphery of Europe
Its very hard for Greek products to compete to German ones
Its hard to compete even domestically
There is no taxation of German products like with american products lets say so theyre almost cheaper than Greek ones and this is hurting Greek factories
If you go to a greek supermarket you wont find irish finnish or portuguese products but theres a crap ton of German ones
This results in unemployment and a lot of other issues
Then theres the defence budget
Germany is surrounded by EU countries and switzerland and spend 1% for defence budget
Eastern Europe has to deal with Russia and south east with Turkey and middle east
If EU was like USA these things wouldnt be a problem but in EU every country is looking for its own interests
This guy explains it very well in 6 min
Now regarding capitalism
In capitalism you have economic crisis all the time
What will you say when Italy or some other country collapses and EU does nothing to fix it
Will you blame lazy and greedy Italians that dare to ask for help
Im sure you will and thats why EU will collapse
I know that what is true
Oversimplifications and comfortable 2 line rhetorics from people who have no expertise or insider angle
No, I do not "know it's true" and I do not appreciate anyone running their mouth or keyboards like they know everything

Is there a "__ Thursday" in other countries too

That Greece has a +12 in the economic situation proves how meaningless this whole chart is
Cause you know though we may believe that our government can handle the economy better than the EU, according to this chart, but it doesn't mean we believe that they are good at managing it anyway
&#x200B;
But
that +32 on Military Defence, also being the highest number on the list, is very telling
Between a rock and a hard place
I would prefer having a 'I don't trust any government' option
You would see a different map
Greeks trusting the EU even less than Finland on military defence is kind of funny to me
Only Greeks get to complain about their government and financial, social situation etc
If someone else implies a negative aspect we grab the pitchforks and torches
TL;DR: A surprising amount
In Greece we still have the "Occupation" syndrome (Katohiko)
People hamstering food and never leaving anything on their plate
Also comes in the form of "forced" eating and excessive food prep
Mostly prominent within grandparents; it is something that was transferred to the next generations as well
Remnant of ww2 and the nazi occupation
My late grandmother used to tell me all kinds of stories about those dark times
It formed our current mindset and attitude as a nation and is still subconsciously affecting our lives
And knowing the way history tends to repeat itself, I'm a bit worried about the years to come and especially about water
Everyone thought that the twin Greece - Cyprus was exaggerating when asking for sanctions
Guess its only serious when important coutries take some of the heat too
*Slaps roof of Germany*
This country fits some many nein
Oh NOW we want to sanction Turkey Europe
ahh yes . History repeats itself once again
I dont have a problem if its an important EU country,the thing that did it for me was when everyone was fighting for sanctions on Belarus, a non-EU country, and no one gave a shit about what we are facing
Germany and some others ain't gonna ditch their interests in Turkey because we have a standoff with the Turks
Sanctioning Belarus was an easy thing to do because they had nothing to lose
Now that the problem is at their doorstop they will have to do something
I hope  this time they will go all out and not pamper Turkey again as they did in the last summit
Well to be fair, although I always bought French products, France should think about moving the factories it has in some muslim countries and afterwards we can talk about supporting this notion in an organized fashion
It's kinda idiotic to support the employees that boycott you

No I agree

Greece is doing fine like hell tertiary in thrace
Didn't expect that
Don't fool yourselves from geography, Greece's five biggest cities are in blue areas
And we are a super urbanized country, so that's around 80% of population
I expected this result, in Greece university is like the only way forward, we are a heavily based white collar country
Let me fill the rest for you (joking):
Albania: red and some yellow
Serbia: yellow and a tiny bit of blue
Bosnia and Herzegovina: yellow
Moldova: Yellow
Belarus: Red and yellow
Ukraine: Yellow, red and just a tiny bit of blue
Russia: Yellow, red and just a tiny bit of blue
Why not
They have two university towns
Also Crete, I surely didn't expect that

Σαν Αθηναίος δεν ήξερα πού και άλλα μέρη της Ελλάδας εκτός από Θεσσαλονίκη είχαν καλή εκπαίδευση λολ
Σαν Αθηναίος που είσαι, πάλι καλά να λέμε που ξέρεις και τη Θεσσαλονίκη
Κοίτα η αλήθεια να λέγεται, τα σοβαρά πανεπιστήμια είναι Αθήνα/Θεσσαλονική με εξαίρεση κάποιες σχολές, πχ το Βιολογικό της Κρήτης είναι το καλύτερο από ότι έχω ακούσει.
Τώρα άσε τους άλλους να λένε ότι το πανεπιστήμειο της Ξάνθης ή του Αιγαίου είναι όσο καλό όσο τα ΕΚΠΑ/ΕΜΠ/ΑΠΘ
Παρόλα αυτά, πτυχίο παίρνεις από όλα, οπότε μετράει.
Η υπόλοιπη Ελλάδα είναι irrelevant
Το πανεπιστήμιο Κρήτης ξεπερνάει όλα της υπόλοιπης Ελλάδας στον δείκτη THE, ο οποίος μετράει τις επιδόσεις με βάση τις δημοσιεύσεις που βγάζει το πανεπιστήμιο κάθε χρόνο. Και γενικά η αλήθεια να λέγεται, το επίπεδο της εκπαίδευσης που έχουμε, δεν υπάρχει ιδιαίτερα στο ΕΚΠΑ/ΑΠΘ, τουλάχιστον από ότι έχω ακούσει.

**Cries in Greek**
For Greece,
With adsl if i sit on the dslam I will get ~20 down ~1 up at ~19 euro for just the internet
With vdsl* you will get ~50 down ~5 up for 30-35 euro and you get obligatory minutes on your land-line to justify the price
Then we got ftth* at 100 up - 10 down or 200 up 20 down for, get this 40-50 euro and 50-60 euro with a bunch of land line minutes that you of course won't care about but they have to justify the bullshit price
These are the prices from the 3 big telecoms giants that control everything and have a monopoly
* is because you need to be lucky to have access to vdsl and ftth and even when you have ftth the 3 big telecom companies won't give you the same upload/download on Fucking fiber to the home
Then there are 2 small companies that (thank the flying spaghetti monster) started putting their own fiber network for ftth in my city and area
One of then whom I use started out at 28 euro per month, with no contract, toy can stop any month you want for 100mbit up/down upgrades to 200 if you sign a contract for 2 years no extra charge
Then we have the government giving you a 13 euro per month payment for 2 years if you do use a ftth connection as part of the modernisation of the internet in the country but of course the small guy with the best prices who first put ftth in Greece in my city doesn't get in this program
It's only for the big 3 who took ages to put some fucking fiber on the ground
I am sure the situation with the monopolies holding the aging networks and charging big time for it, is similar for a lot you guys aswell
I pay 10 times that for 10 times less good internet
37€ 100/10Mbps here
There are companies providing 120/120Mbps for as low as 25€ and 1/1Gbps for as high as 360€ but the coverage is minimal

If we went to speak instead of read/write, Spain would be way less than 85%. They think that speaking at the English level that Greek kids can speak at age 13 is actually adequate
Cheating in what way
It's very hard to find a job in Greece without knowing at the very least English
I'd say that number is about right for us
How are we cheating
Kids take English* at school and go to the evening English private schools (φροντιστήρια)
We also don't dub movies-series and we rely heavily on tourism where English is used almost always
*There are also French and German lessons while Spanish is on the rise

do you are have stupid
Erdogan knows how to deal with such situations
The bin where Erdogan sends EU's strongly worded letters
I believe that it is obvious that by “EU” we mean “countries in the European Union” and we condemn the fact that they (Germany,Spain,Italy) put fiscal gains over an idea and an institution that they created, the European Union
A Union for fucks sake
We should be united behind a common cause
Yet, when Greece and Cyprus agreed on sanctioning Russia our intrests were hurt
About the migrants part
Total BS
If Erdo unleashes the migrants there a 100% change that these will go only to Greece and nowhere else
So don't tell me that Germany and others are actually carrying about us and they don't want us to be overwhelmed with migrants

Me as a greek: what's that heatwave everyone is talking about
finally something we are the best at
Suffering from success
And to make it worse in the Greek article linked below it says that for 8 days the temperature didn't drop below 30° even during nighttime
Edit: Small correction, the above info from the article is about the 1987 heatwave that peaked at 44° not the 1977 one that peaked at 48°.
But this was in '77 in Athens, it was because Athens back then especially was a big cement block of a city with horrible transportation system, tons of cars that burned leaded fuel , smog and no trees what so ever
So it was  the perfect environment for horrific smog and heatwaves .This days the situation is way better
Yeah but mostly because people are unprepared, there's ways to cope even in those temps

You will never surpass us Greeks in bus submarine technology go cry with your panzerkampfwagen's. Lol
Greece should be 500 (because thats how much most people get)
Means nothing without taking taxation into account
Now compare suicide rates
Or the Thessaloniki metro for us Greeks haha
Usually drug dealer park is next to the station
Usually drug dealer park is next to the station
Do they watch it dubbed or subbed
I know Germany is a big dubbing country, but you lose so much nuance here when you dub over the actors' original voices/accents
You don't have the option of German subtitles on Netflix
I would say artistic integrity and maintaining the fullness of the performance, but you already said your sister and parents don't care \*shrugs\*
Megali Idea and Kurdistan live
In which year did Dutch mountaineers first reach the summit
We are the only country in EU where the Sharia law is still legal
In Crete most if not all people have at least one kind of gun in their house (anything from a hunting rifle to the latest fully automatic rifle) and some time ago (maybe even now I have no idea) the rest are Vendettas where families (by families I mean a group of people that have the same surname) would go into all out war between each other for any kind of reason
I'm from Crete but I Grew up in Attica and my family used to be in a Vendetta when someone was operating my Great Grandfathers excavator and he rolled over and died and his family blamed my great grandpa and I don't know how that ended
Ah, the good ol' shaming the victim
It's a dominant mindset over here as well and it's disgusting
Ωπα κάτσε τι;
Crete is
scary
Like, really scary
I'm from Thessaloniki and we mainly solve problems by saying "χαλαρά" and then going for a beer
Explain to me why is this dark
Same in Greece, different punishments
I don't think that time serving the public or getting prepared for war is time stolen or wasted
Not who you replied to, but skipping military training doesn't land you in prison in Greece, except for periods of war
There are many smaller problems associated, though
For instance, if you are abroad you are only allowed to be in Greece for a maximum of 30 days/year, if you are skipping service
Also you can buy out your service when you are 33 for around 7000€.
None, why would i?
I would like for Greeks and Turks to live peacefully , but obliderating their country
No i wouldnt
Switzerland, just for the chaos of the lost money of pretty much everyone rich enough in this continent
Greece, we might as well become modern day Atlantis
A little useless place in southern europe like macedonia
No not really we wouldn't obliterate them lol, they're a bit too small
Yup, that's the point
There's not a trace of Atlantis either
It will be a myth that will last for generations
I had no idea he could actualy become the PM,thought it was a joke
Everyone's fekked, that's my reaction
After all this, I'm sitting here thinking "They still still have the ability to unilaterally recall article 50", but nope, everyone still wants to dig the brexit grave even deeper
I'm appalled by the fact that there was that whole "X amount of money going to the EU that could be funneled into the NHS" malarkey knowing how much EU funding the UK received
At least in Greece there are signs pointing out that X project was funded in part by the EU
Nothing of the sort in the UK as far as I recall, there's a huge lack of education regarding that
I'm freakin' pissed with Greece's lack of proper management of EU development funds, let alone the fact that the UK has also been heavily funded, but somehow skewed a large portion of public opinion into thinking that the EU is some kind of oppressive regime
Do I have to remind people that this Social and Economic union is probably one of the main reasons this continent hasn't wrecked itself again since the end of the 2nd World War
He looks like someone doing a bad impression of Trump
I feel honored to do so as well
When it comes to nationalism, and even patriotism to an extent, I want nothing to do with it
I've never been a fervent supporter of banners, and I self-criticize more than I boast, but when it comes to the institution that is the European Union, all bets are off
There are always problems when it comes to maintaining this union among sovereign states
There are compromises, sluggish bureaucracy, economic issues, social issues, you name it, but the truth is, we've also enjoyed long-term prosperity and peace under it, and I want nobody badmouthing my EU
As is the case with all member states
It's just large scale taxation
You chip in according to your GDP and you get funding for projects, infrastructure and so on
That was the whole deal, no one weighed the benefits when it came to the whole "NHS bus" thing
Sure, you chip in X million according to your GDP, but you're also eligible for funding, and there was lots of it
It was never free money, but it's also not a disproportionate amount compared to the privileges received
Basically all of our ancient or medieval history which is full of civil wars and back-stabbing
Or literally during our independence war
Yeah that's right, after 400 years of Ottoman occupation, we fought a civil war in the middle of our independence war against them
Right now in history I'd say is one of the biggest bruh moments fot Greece
1897 greco-turkish war (the unlucky war) was quite a big bruh momentum, as it wasnt intended, and we got defeated pretty hard
1921, at one moment Greece has territories in Turkey including Constantinople, and in the next the Allies in WW1 switch sides helping Turkey re take all of their land in minor asia back kicking out the Greeks in the process
I am sure it was unavoidable, and could have ended better for Greece
I feel like I often get confused about which phrases make sense in English and which in Greek, sometimes saying a string of words that has absolutely no meaning in Greek
Yeah it happens but when it comes to numbers I always read the number in greek in my head and sometimes even mumble it out while reading an English text or speaking English
I did a few years ago but I've become more social the past few years so I use my native language more
No offence but the German grammar doesn't sound all that better either
I have the stereotypical Greek accent mixed with a slight attempt at pronouncing some things right and it leads to an abomination of an accent
I despise my accent deeply but I probably will never do anything to fix it
I find it funny and it's used as a joke a lot
I was once told by someone it sounds Arabic, I haven't spoken to that person ever since
I think it's mire than good compared to other Greeks, but I want to improve it a bit
I used to hate it but now I kinda like it, it sounds unique but also depends on who is speaking
I feel that most greeks hate it and that's why I feel a bit insecure about it
I used to have a pretty good accent although I believe I sounded more American than British, however lately I haven't gotten many chances to have long conversations in English, especially with people who's mother tongue is English thus my pronunciation took a hit
My fluency in English also tanked a bit
My accent is fine, everyone I've met understands it
Generally, the Greek accent is a heavy one so I can tell from miles that a person is Greek
Unfortunately, if one has a good English accent, they get mocked by fellow Greeks because they put effort, and I hate this
I basically have to switch to a shitty Greek accent when speaking English every time another Greek is present
It'd be interesting to see if this phenomenon appears in other countries too
I actually hate the greek accent, but the thing is that I have a completely american accent naturally, it is indistinguishable from an american accent and many people think I'm from the USA
But the funny thing is that foreign people seem to really like it when I speak with a greek accent, so I may or may not purposely talk with a greek accent most of the time now because foreigners find it "exotic" or what they call it
lmao
Sometimes I do
Like most Greeks, I was taught British English, used the Greek accent though at some point I started trying to make it sound smoother (but apparently it sounds fake to most non-Greeks), and lots of times I'll attempt to do an American accent to get Google voice commands to work properly
I've been told that my standard Greek accent sounds better, but sometimes I can't shake the uneasiness when it starts sounding like a port barker (those yelling "rooms to let" when you get off a ferry in most Greek islands)
I always thought it sounded very bad and not understandable but I've been complimented on it before, although I really can't understand what's nice about it lol
[sounds like this]
i suppose it's because we are given a cheap android phone when we're teens and so switching os is pretty inconvenient and takes too long to get a hold of
in my case i was given a small lg and because i had to buy the rest of my phones myself i went with cheap phones that are just as good, my Xiaomi redmi 6
This is how I always see it
Android is cheaper, it does the job done
I also don't want to be robbed or killed for a several hundred euros iphone
And I hate that there is exclusivity on iphones
It's like annoying Adobe
And guess what, everyone switches to Affinity because of that
I think iphones will become like that
People will start thinking if they really need it or not
Chances are, they don't. And security wise it's equally shit
Well the top iPhone right now costs as much as two months of salaries you could say buy an iPhone 4-6 but outside of their chipset and maybe camera everything else is bad and outdated, the second reason is that most people never joined the cult of apple like America has with its walled ecosystem
Athens
It's dirty, it's impossible to live there, there's no green, if you see the city from a satellite or from a plane while you're flying, it's like a motherboard of a computer
It's just a wasted potential, it could be much better
Thessaloniki, but it is not shame, more like mild annoyance
It is the only really big city of the country except for Athens, but still much smaller than Athens
Most of Thessaloniki citizens like complaining about how all the infrastracture goes to Athens and they are neglected blah blah
They are way more conservative than Athens, more religious on average and have a very annoying type of localism
Now, about regions but not cities, the souther tip of Peloponnese (Mani) and big part of Crete are a disgrace, they like preserving macho stereotypes as "traditions", they like guns, they think that driving drunk is "manly" and generally they are some decades behing in mentality
Well actually it depends on which suburb you live in
The center is alright I guess (and by Center I mean the very center like syntagma and acropolis)
Then the northern suburbs are pretty nice (more greenery and overall richer) and the south suburbs are nice too
The west suburbs and the rest of the center are well known to be a shit hole tho
Why are you ashamed of Aspropyrgos
I’m from there and it’s fine if you don’t pay attention to the ‘news’ too much lol
Patras does not have a weird reputation, it is mostly known for the carnival
Pyrgos is gypsy capital of Greece, and yup, one of the worst cities
If you mean Glifada, well, I speak about regular people
I have lived and by live, I mean one month plus in Marousi which is considered a very good area by Athens standards, but I just couldn't stand it
I am from Crete and I have lived in Heraklion, Chania and Thessaloniki, all good
Athens is a nightmare
First of all, you can't breathe if you come from a rural area due to the pollution
When I had been studying in Chania, students from Athens were coming and they were getting dizzy by the oxygen
Pretty much agree, but Heraklion
Really
I've never visited a shittier city in terms of traffic and driving behavior, overall even more chaotic than Athens
It's lesser known because of the nice stuff going on: nature, beaches, historic places, etc
But, hell, I would rather live in the shithole called Athens rather than in Heraklion
I can’t disagree with that
We are, but for obvious reasons that I’m not going to explain here in detail
This place was different from other ones, people were different, kids grew up differently and therefore shaped a very different and distinct attitude which people from other areas do not like or afraid of in many ways and I can’t blame them
Just stop listening to the news about this place haha
My go to is "I was waiting hours for the bus"" or "the traffic was horrible" which is true for the city I live in
Especially, the public transportation part is abysmal
In School we say "the bus was late again" Because busses here are almost never on time
Or just "my alarm didn't go off"
Idk bout Greece in general but in Thessaloniki we say that the metro was late
It's been under construction since 1985
South europe unite
The cool guy that people like to hang around with but everyone kinda wants them to get fired
Unemployed
Pretty sure greece would be that co-worker who's always out of money and asks you to lend them 100€ even though he owns so much that if he ever paid you back you would be able buy a house in NYC and a jet but you reluctantly give him what he asks for because he gave you an answer during a test in third grade and you own him one
Of course he will never pay you back
*Wtf does this dude do with money and he's always out anyway
Does he eat it
Does he plant it and wait for a money tree to grow
Who knows
Also, everyone knows he got the job because his father's cousin's wife's sister-in-law knows (and occasional sleeps with) the boss
Greece - The guy who has been in the corner since always, but no one knows what exactly his job is
We would be the unemployed guy outside the office's building
Unemployed
Or you would start a fight in the building and then point the finger at the German ;)
This guy works here
First time I see him
Did you describe my life
Well that explains it
Imperial measurement system
For a whole month I had to google convert everything to metric
A year later, I joined the military and most American Vehicles in our army were are using imperial measurement system and to this day this is something that pisses me off
I have to say
Never been to America but damn, African-Americans are *insanely* religious (from what I see on YT)
ikr
I've never been to the US but I know that the standard coffee there is drip coffee, and hell, I would need seven cups a day to keep awake if I could only drink drip coffee

EVERYWHERE
Greeks and Danes seem to do that as well for some reason
Greece: the horrible and disgraceful Moria refugee camp is still there
People say they care about the refugees, but nobody does anything to close the place down
Normalizing restrictions of personal freedoms for the sake of public health
This should not happen
People starting to think that touching and social contacts are dangerous and bad
I do not want Europe to become Korea and Taiwan, with people going outside with masks
And I thought we were corrupted
I'm Greek  so basically every single one,
Names like Pericles, Ares, Hera and ancient Greek names in general are still in use today
Yes, YES
When I'm travelling abroad and suddenly overhear someone else speak Greek I feel like my mind glitches
44% of individual income goes to taxes
First in motorcycle fatal accidents rate in EU
3% of Greeks are in danger of poverty
You get pension when you are 67 yo
Greeks work more hours than every other European
80% of the country is mountainous
1/3 of the population lives in Athens
The deepest point in the Mediterranean is in Calypso Deep, south-west of Pylos
There is a desert on the island of Lemnos
The stripes of the flag are the same number as the syllables of "ελευθερία ή θάνατος" (=liberty or death), which was the motto of the 1821 Greek Revolution
Portugal and orange may look similar in greek but they are not synonymous
Does the first one refer to SU
For example, VAT is 24% on almost everything
There is variation for higher and lower classes but the 44% is an average
It's normal for a state that has significant social welfare and offers high quality public services, like public safety (police), public transport, etc
That's the case for Netherlands or Sweden, not for Greece
At least you get something back
Ours mostly service loan interests
The most buffling one I saw recently was that people in a city where a new 5G Network was installed gathered signatures to remove it because allegedly it was a plot by Europeans to turn them infertile
I like how 5G can barely pass through tree leaves yet people think it can cause serious issues
slow the much oil, is very easy to speak with greek way
Wanker mine, if think that you can work me, are mistaken

Interesting exercise
Will use this the opportunity for speaking for[about] the cats my
Have two cats
The one is mother of other
Them love much
But they not loving [each other]
Indeed, hating [each other]
More particular, the daughter hates the mother hers
When her see, [at] her glare
With hatred
Like to want to her kill
If the mother approaches, the daughter meows aggressively
The mother scared, freezes, looks with straight-[wide]open eyes, very cute, and flees
Often, hide under from furniture for to [be] saved, because the daughter runs to her hunt, and if her catch, [I] hear screaming meows [of] attack and noises [of] fight
[I] run for to stop [them], but fighting so intensely, that [I] end up with scratches everywhere
Don't know how to them make to become friends
Accept advice, thank from the before
At the down down of the write, who cares
σιγα τον πολυελαιο

Well we are so awful in football in the last years so it's not like we will even take part there anyway so
I mean, we arent americans, most ultras/hools here actually help their team mire then cause trouble
Well this is the dillhema that always arises in this context for example in the cheap clothing discussion
My take on this is that the alternative often is something very very simple in contrast to the original boycotting idea
I would say that to me it just seems to be a poor excuse to say that sharing awareness is enough
It is only there to make people think that something is being done and that it is enough
If an alternative is to be made it should be it should be as difficult, important and expressive as the boycott
Maybe fine Qatar for it's perversion of such a sporting event
Yes and if the US introduces visas for all EU citizens that's perfectly fine
US's current stance completely undermines EU integrity
Oh boi that's a question with an neverending answer but to keep things shorts
Let's just say founding SYRIZA party
His 2015 shenanigans damaged even more Greece's reputation
People were joking about that for many years lmao

Every little thing is unthinkable in our lock down
Isolation is not possible in Greek life
Having no friends over
Not eating or drinking until dawn on a Saturday night
Not being able to go to the cinemas or the theater
STANDING IN QUEUES WITH 2M DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE OTHER MUMBLING GREEK
WAITING PATIENTLY TO ENTER IN SUPER MARKETS IN TEAMS OF 10 PEOPLE EACH TIME
HAVING TO FOLLOW A SPECIFIC SET OF RULES BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S HEALTH WILL SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL
DID I MENTION QUEUES
I am not panicking, you are
In all seriousness, even bouzoukia and clubs are closed
Public beaches and ski resorts are closed
Even our Easter is canceled
The fun part is that, my age group (35) and younger has adopted quite well, with all the above
Hell brakes loose when there are older people involved, like 55 and above
The main reason is that they are not adapt at technology as we are and they feel trapped
NOTE: There are still tourists walking around Athens, expecting to see the Parthenon and the museums
And good luck to them, because the closest they will get to them is through the official websites and Google maps view
Seriously, it's for the best
Europe needs to build a vast network of high speed railways, just like China is doing
Greece is too far away from most of europe and sadly too insignificant financially to justify such an investment, especially for passenger trains
The only way this would work is Greece developing as a logistics hub connecting Europe to Africa and Asia
I really love trains and they are a very good alternative to regional aviation, but this scenario is kinda farfetched
I know, it would be great but Greece doesn't seem to be the center of attention when it comes to investments, nor do we have a state that favours them (bureaucracy etc
We could always do better, plus an investment on land has to create jobs mostly for the locals, which is a great thing for Greece
The revival of south-east Europe doesn't seem to be Germany's priority so it could prove really difficult to go through with a big plan
Hope dies last though
Well here in Greece we see them every now and Again, we Also  see about the syrian refugees and such fairly often
I don't really see them anymore (but then again I have stopped watching Greek tv) but I did grow up in the 90s with the stereotype of poor Africa/starving children
Unicef really bombarded us with it and I'd usually buy at least one unicef notebook every year "to help the African children" which would be double the price of a normal notebook and they'd hand them out at schools
Our landlord was a known prick but when he died we found out he was giving a ton of money every month to Unicef when he didn't really have much
I had a Greek-Somali schoolmate and through her I got to know the variety of Africa
She'll tell me crazy stories and how mangoes and bananas taste nothing like the shit we have here
She'd show us videos of her time in a Greek military camp in Somalia before she'd come to live here, and it was an eye opener
Nowadays I think it's ActionAid that advertises more
People would rather support programs were you give enough money for a village in Africa to built a well or some sort of irrigation system rather than giving them cookies with multivitamins etc
African nations have started gaining tech knowledge and there are businesses and investments going
Apart from some migrant camps and political instability we don't see the image of a starving child as much
Well "simp" Seems the most fitting for me
Cause in Greek it's Μουνόδουλος (Mounódoulos) which literally translates to "pussy slave" which is way different attitude from plain "simp
Oh I haven't heard of that one but by its definition I can tell you Μουνόδουλος is a combination of pussywhipped and simp
I think it was used like normie or something I'm not sure
I named my black cat Tod because Google Translate said it means death in German, but it sounds like a normal pet name
Aww, they delivered it to my door every September
Wise move though, we have a planet’s ecosystem to save
That's great news
I receive 2 in the mail (everyone in my neighbourhood does, I can't explain why)
I do occasionally scour through them but whenever I actually need something, it's their site that I'll use-much easier
What winter
Currently wearing flip flops right now
Yes and no
Some people still love bringing up WW2 in every chance, but it became more popular because of the austerity that was seen as imposed by Germany
Greek people really hate being patronized and dictated what to do and not to do, so the anti-German sentiment skyrocketed and the Nazi parallels were unavoidable
But it is mostly because Nazism is a convenient easy parallel for Germany, more than anything else, not because they really believe that nowadays Germany has anything to do with that
I wouldn't say anti German people since there's a German village 10 minutes away from my village and we get along pretty well, but I would definitely say anti German government due to the fact that all 3 economic adjustment programs were made by Germans and Merkel imposed them, so as you can imagine, almost no one likes Merkel, especially when she supported Erdoğan
Now, about nazis etc
I would say only the old people who lived through it
The rest not that much
Yeah, it kinda is still and while i understand where it stems from it's a bit too much
I personally have encountered too many times anti-german people
Sometimes people even say things they made up straight from their mind
Like I get it
We don't like Germany from a historical point of view but it gets on my nerves
I was born and raised in Germany and people are most of the time ignorant of the modern time Germany
They really think things like "they are cold people", " they are racists", "they are suppressing us",  "their language is unpleasant, stiff and brutal" just to say a few common things
And whenever I say something about Germany or being born in Germany some people have this look in there face like this is very unpleasant for them, so to speak
They don't really like Germany at all here
In general, Germans here are regarded as rule-abiding citizens, hard-working if a bit stiff and humourless
Germany is a widely used example to provide contrast to the greek tendency to view laws as guidelines rather than actual rules
Due to the current economic crisis, which begun about 10 years ago, many people view northern Europeans negatively, because they are the creditors, but German get a special acknowledgement here, mainly by morons who think Germany owes us reparations for WWII
Older people tend to view Germany more positively too, because many of them or members of their families were able to migrate there and work after Greece tore itself up in the civil war in '45
I myself have a great-aunt who lived in Germany for 40 years
Nah, but anti- German sentiment is strong in small villages that suffered the atrocities of the Nazi
People in this villages are mostly boomers
There is a general dislike because of WWII mainly, but there are other factors that contribute as well
From personal experience Germans are stereotyped as rude, boring and that they have a superiority complex
Also another reason is their treatment of Greeks (again, comes from people's experiences)
I don't know a single Greek that doesn't have a relative that hasn't faced racism in Germany and German tourists are seen as the most disrespectful (although that could be confirmation bias, I've noticed it as well)
That's not to say that Germans are bad people and I have anything against them, the newer generations tend to be more indifferent/neutral to German people as well and the dislike is towards the government and of course, the Germans of the 1930s-1940s.
Yes it is
Plenty of people will now say that they're above and beyond it but then Germany goes and does something new that we dislike and it all comes back
It can't be helped if they always oppose us in many different things
If you've been to greece you'll know that most people are kind towards you if you engage them
However distrust towards Germany is deeply rooted in the general discourse
I would argue that this is natural when most of us have been brought up on horrific stories of starvation, slaughtering of families or even entire villages that our parents and grandparents experienced
As a result even the most reasonable greek harbours some prejudice against Germans and especially the German government
Yes
We even have a curse word for people who agree with Germany politically: germanotsolias
Hard to translate, but sort of Greek guard of Germans
Propably from polonisation during the time of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth
I never faced racism in Germany and I rly doubt this has anything to do with the feelings of Greeks towards Germans
Also, at least in my experience, British tourists get more negative attention than the German ones
This is just a popular term for the security batallions of the 1940s.
Hard to say
It is not going downwards, it has pretty much stagnated, with salaries, taxes etc remaining more or less the same the last years
But this is not good the way Greek people see it, we have the Purchasing Power of former Eastern Block countries right now
it has stabilized in a quite low point
That has been exactly our behaviour through the last decade (and more or less before, too)
A malfunctioning, highly corrupted State, a (declining) majority of citizens with no respect for the law, an unbelievably socialistic (almost communistic) financial system with heavy taxation and a gargantuan public sector that offers services of the poorest quality
So, how do we find the money for all that shit, without blaming ourselves
State + media: Oh, it's the Germans, they hate our sun and our history, they want to bankrupt us
A month ago I learnt Nokia is finnish and not japanese
I thought for a long time that Porsche was Italian .
Nokia sounds pretty japanese
I was researching bell labs history
Hey I noticed your username is Greek
I have to ask what's the story behind it, if you want to share
It depends on where you live
Usually coastal areas or islands don't have that good of a quality water and buy bottled
Then again further into the mainland its totally fine, but even there in some cases as the guys from Italy mentioned it may have too much chlorine to the point you can taste it, averting people from consuming it
As long as there's a filter, we'll drink the tap water no problem
Without a filter I'd probably go with bottled water
Also in a suburb of Attica
I think it's more as a precaution from what I've noticed with others who do the same
All the time
Sometimes there's no corresponding word(s) in Greek
I truly hate it when this happens
British Empire reduced to the size of Massachusetts but they left an enormous linguistic footprint in the world
Quite often unfortunately
And sometimes I don't remember a word in either my native language or English, which is even more annoying
Way more than often
Mostly because 100% of my entertainment is in English
yup it happens quite a lot
i never browse the Greek internet so in the day i use english almost as much as Greek especially now that we're in quarantine again
too often, i had to google translate words from english to greek, because i forgot the word, too many times
my essays in english were really good too but in greek, they were like a 10 year old wrote them
I honestly feel like it literally happens as often as the opposite, it has become a 50/50 split
Sometimes that, sometimes I may have learnt how to say something in English but Greek is more readily available in my mind
That and the awkward moment of having to describe some item or tool/utensil in one or the other language
If you're gonna eat souvlaki, for the love of God, eat it wrapped as it is, just hold it and bite it, don't open it up and use a fork and a knife
It's not even that serious, but still hurts our soul
Nothing really, except maybe some politics, regarding Alexander the Great, kastellorizo and calling us lazy for example
Never call someone's bullshit or never go against someone's beliefs, here people will defend their opinion like it's their home even if proven wrong
Same here lol
I mean, yeah there are many strong-headed people over here and if they feel attacked they're fast to get ultra defensive and attack back, but I'm pretty sure there are also many people who are willing to have civilized conversations lol
"we, on the contrary, shall fight for North Macedonia, and our hearts will be in it" Alexandreski Greatovic
I have to agree, while a super rare occurrence, there are people that will admit that they are wrong in a conversation or make a normal mature conversation
We were nearly always in the bottom in Jeux Sans Frontieres
Greece finished in the last place at 2008 Euro Championship
It's funny because Greece won the the previous Euro (2004)
I loved that show
That's the only way EU countries should interact with each other
>Jeux Sans Frontieres
What the hell is that
i dont think we should
The only time that happens to me is when me and a group of friends happen to play against Turkish people on rocket league and that once friend of the group decides to get all toxic and nobody knows if they're being serious or not
I don't know how Germans and Italians feel but when we Greeks talk about "the war", we swell with pride
Our ancestors, soldiers and civilians both fought bravely to defend our land and however they have suffered, we feel very proud of them
Same goes for the heroes of the first world war, the Balkan wars, the revolution, and everything else, we have nothing to be ashamed for
well aside from the balkans not that often
i mean if a German were to tell me their father or grandfather carried out the mass killings in Crete i would get kinda aggressive as my grandfather barely got out alive and i loved him with all my heart
If an italian were to tell me their grandfather fought us in ww2 i would maybe tease them a bit but that's all
all of that without including the balkans obviously
can confirm
Honestly, I don't really get it
I'm a total pacifist and I can vibe with just about everyone, even laugh at the past (or even present) conflicts between our countries
I don't get why someone would attack someone else for something as insignificant as being born a few kilometres farther away (and still literally having the same culture)
Of course every war is a disgrace, especially among Greeks and Italians that we have such a tight bond since ancient times
But what's the point saying that when we didn't have a choice
In Greece we are proud of our ancestors standing up to invaders, whoever these were
If by that you mean the Byzantines, then yes
Hell we consider Roman history our DLC
Yes, we do, we consider Byzantium the predecessor of Greece
Not necessarily, he was fond of the Germans but he was 100% aligned with the British, as they were the reason his government was formed in the first place
Although he was a dictator and people blindly praising him are uneducated
To have shame about something you need to know about it
I, being myself a Greek, I can tell you with confidence that we are very proud of our history, yet ignorant for the most part of it
Our school history books refer to that emperor as the Bulgarian killer (Bulgaroktonos), but I can't remember feeling ashamed of our ancestors regarding to the context of that
I was  young when we learnt about it in school, so I might need to re-educate myself on that matter
Something that happened centuries ago, is too deeply buried in the past to make us feel any shame
Oh yeah, I was never that person myself
I'm just saying that the average Greek will not know details about the event
i'd say the climate produces more warm and happy people but i don't know at the same time
here in Greece people party and get drunk once a week and everyone smokes from a young a young age and our life expectancy is 82
30 as of 2020
It's the diet
Colder countries consume more meat and fat-heavy diets, whereas mediterranean countries have some of the most healthy and balanced diets
>Steps begin when you are from some rural parts in the south east where they are very religious and closed-minded
I think that this is happening in most of the world though
The fact that it's only the southeast part sounds pretty good from my perspective
>The “LGBT ideology”
So, I have a friend who is kind of right wing, but I wouldn't say homophobic as far as I have seen
She has told me that the people in general are okay with the homosexuals, but the LGBT movement started crossing the line with the parades with some weird wood-paper statues of Holy Mary and Jesus painted rainbow and making them seem like clowns and then letting them out of the churches
Also, she told me that some people have seen what's happening in the US with the trans kids and they are afraid that if they give the LGBT movement a bit of space, then it will demand more
It is legal to change it at 15, but there's a with therapist and huge paperwork
In the US though, there are 3 years old trans kids which is seriously extreme
The fact that we are slow on everything benefits us sometimes
There is a compilation video of greek being spoken in different tv series or movies
It was the funniest shit ever
Somewhere I couldn't even understand what they were saying
The funniest one was from Xena the Princess warrior where Gabrielle (I think that's her name) was saying kalimera kalispera and then you hear kalinoches, as if they tried to merge kalimera and buenas noches lmao
Also, every time I hear russian I cringe a little bit hahaha, especially when the actor is a side character
Just hire a russian speaking actor
Other comments have already mentioned it below but we have fun with it
There is a really funny video compilation of attempts of hollywood to speak greek
Most is some mystic shit with ancient gods and titans and whatever
I will say this and hopefully nobody takes offense as I'm sure it goes the other way round
I find that many american actors have hilarious accents when it comes to speaking other languages, moreso than other nationalities, especially when they speak spanish
Something like Ow-Lah
Comoh ey-stas
So this always gives room for some giggles
It's just hilarious and most of the time, if they speak Greek randomly, I won't understand it immediately because they butcher it
I usually go:
"What did he/she say
Oh that was in Greek
Oh, ok
[This is the video .]
As mentioned the first 2 minutes from Xena is the best part . I think that someone asked the crew if they know any Greek words and put them randomly in this scene totally out of context .
I couldn't stop laughing at while watching the video with friends, and it still gets me every time
Ευχαριστω παρά πολυ
Ετσι κι ετσι
Γεια σου καλημερα
ΓειΑ σου καληνΥχτα
ΓΕΙΑ ΣΟΥ καληnotches
Ψοφαω καθε. Φορα.
Το βίντεο είχε part 2 και 3, όπου σε κάποια φάση από το GTA IV ένας npc λέει "I am a stupid malaka, please don't kill me" πεθαναααα
We have political parties youths acting inside the universities
Very often they decide that in order to protest about something they do not like (from a change in the studies programme up to a new law or
the war in Syria - no I am not kidding) they propose to the student body to "take over the building".
They call a "gathering" of all the students of the faculty, and in a proceeding involving speeches, shouting, arguing, booing etc that usually lasts hours they proceed to a vote on whether their proposal will pass or not (you can imagine how few people actually have nothing better to do than compete in this farce for hours)
"Taking over" the building ( I do not know how to express it in English better) means that they forbid any professor, PhD, cleaner, technician, secretary etc to enter, all academic procedures are halted
Until recently the police was banned by law from entering universities
But even now that the law changed they very rarely enter to stop this kind of situation unless it escalates in more serious crimes (like drug dealing, storing clubs and makeshift weapons, sheltering illegal immigrants etc) because it has been normalised through the years in the Greek society as a normal situation
Find me another European country that this sort of thing happens !!
plate smashing
Happy cake day
If they were doing 1/10 of what they do in Greece in the UK or Germany, they would have been arrested and suspended from the university, believe me
Also today they did that in schools all around Greece
Even in middle schools and high schools
Usually that's just an excuse to not have lessons in school
Καλά Χριστούγεννα!
Άγγλος στα ραντεβού του/Ágglos sta rantevoú tou: Punctual as an Englishman
Το παίζει Σουηδός/To paízei Souidós: He acts like a Swede, because Swedes in older decades, pre mobile internet, never bothered to learn anything about the place they visited, just went there and somehow expected everything to work out
Κάνει τον κινέζο/Kánei ton kinézo: He tries to pass as inconspicuous, to avoid trouble, like a stereotype about the Chinese says
Του είπε μερικά "γαλλικά"/Tou eípe meriká "galliká": He cursed/trash talked at the other person
Probably because prior to English, French was the dominant foreign language most Greeks would learn, usually those of higher status and wealth
So while French was the language of the aristocrats, "French"(with the quotes) refers to the complete opposite, ie cursing like a dock worker, a truck driver or whatever other professions have cursing at the ready
Αμερικανάκι/Amerikanáki: Refers to the gullible/dumb American stereotype, because back during the time of the brothels and cabarets of Troumba in Pireas, the American sailors on shore leave would be swindled by translators that acted like barkers for cabarets and brothels, which in turn would promptly relieve them of their money
The sailors would also sell small or pocket fm radios to the locals, which the locals thought they'd fooled them but the Americans usually bought those duty free, so they'd finance their night out with no hassle and sometimes with a profit
- Be an Englishman: be punctual
- Speaking Chinese: it's all Greek to me
- Scottish shower: something good followed by something bad and vice versa
Probably not a common phrase, but when me and my dad are sailing in the summer he says "Let's do some Danish sailing" jokingly
Meaning to sail a sailingboat while also "helping" to boost the speed using the motors at the same time
It is more of an inside joke than an actual used phrase though
Αρμένικη βίζιτα - armeniki visita - armenian visit
We say this for visitors who stay longer than expected and won't leave
"Οι Γερμανοί είναι φίλοι μας" (Í germaní íne fíli más)
It means "the Germans are our friends" As a reference to traitors in ww2 and it's used when someone snitches on you
Its a quote from an old movie about crete in ww2
Exact same in Greece (but in Greek, lol)
Orban is establishing an illiberal state for many years and noone did anything about it
Dictatorships are not always established by military coup nowadays
Erdogan was voted in perfectly democratically the first time
When all the signs are there that the guy tries to get even more and more power, don't have a shocked Pikachu face when he finally does it
PiS goals in Poland are the same, step by step
It seems some former communist block countries value the welfare of the economy more than their personal freedom and democratic rights, and big part of population is happy to live in an illiberal state if they have connected it with a better economy
Illiberal democracy is closer to authoritorianism than to Liberal Democracy
It just needs a chance to make the transition
The chance was the virus for Orban
And the problem is that it is a good chance
In many countries there are undemocratic measures taken, in Slovenia the police may get too much power, in Cyprus they want to monitor sick people with prisoners bracelets
Europe is happily giving up personal freedoms and normalizing surveillance and giving more power to the state over them for the sake of a sense of security
EU should get some spine and enforce strict measures for breaches of democracy and oppressing personal freedoms
Starting with Hungary, but only starting there
Nothing is worth going down an illiberal path
Are Hungarians in general supporting these measures ?
Edit: I'm talking about Orban's new powers
There is a video of Boris Johnson reciting the Iliad
He is using erasmian pronunciation, which is widely used abroad in the teaching of ancient Greek
I couldn't make a single word of it, save for the names
One time I was talking to an American study abroad student and he asked me how you say "thank you" in Greek
I told him, and when he tried to repeat it back he sounded like a cat trying to spit out a hairball
I was laughing for a solid few minutes
Other than that, in the second season of the Umbrella Academy, one character screams to another a very well known line from the Oddysey in ancient Greek, which I had to watch about 7 times to understand
His pronunciation was abysmal
Every Cypriot/Greek-Cypriot tv serial and Whenever i hear the Cretan dialect
as a bilingual it happens when i don't expect to hear my own language and i manage to identify a word and feel dumb
Had a client speak to me in a very village accent and in our 2 minute conversation I understood like 30% of what he was saying
Happens all the time when Greek Cypriots are speaking to each other and us mainland Greeks are listening
If you pay enough attention in school you can make some out
The words are not the problem, the syntax is
But you can definitely get the gist of it, even if you're long gone from school
It's not so much the contents but rather the accent
The erasmian accent, despite Erasmus' valiant efforts, is still largely a way for *foreigners* to pronounce ancient Greek, since it ignores elements that survive until today, while the reconstructed ancient accent is easier for Greeks to pronounce instead
The ancient Greek line as well
The Olga Foroga scene was amazing tho
In Greece, when I was going to school, people were telling that if you don't study, you will end up a garbage man
Meanwhile, with the recent garbage men strikes, you need to know someone from above in order to become one
They get paid more than teachers nowadays
I have an environmental engineering degree, but I seriously think of applying
Hmm but that applies even if you study enough and get your degrees
Sad but true
Yeah, these kinds of protogenic jobs are paid better now than the degree jobs
It was a good strategy until the 90s, but then the world filled with educated people who are looking for a job in their field while the quantity need of essential workers is bigger than the degree jobs
Not about Greece itself, but rather about our folklore; I have many times corrected people who are mythtaken about our mythology (Atlas, Medusa, the sun god, Persephone, etc)
I remember someone claiming Ares raped his cousin
like wtf
Had to explain to a couple of American pensioners while they vacated in Delphi, that our troubles weren't *"created by communism post WWII, when we were parts of the Warsaw pact and occupied by Russians".*
A french guy (in France) once asked me what language do we speak in Greece
I replied "Turkish".
We aren’t homeless with no internet connection
Wait till they find about Kratos
o mai god
The fact that we have a deity for every little obscure thing makes me insanely proud
Yeah but no matter what version of the family tree you look at, Ares does not have any rape or dubious consent myths
Like, none at all
>  did Leda lay an egg
Of course not
She laid *two* eggs
It depends on the tradition; first of all, Leda did not have twins, she had quadruplets, or two sets of twins
Those were Helen, Clytemnestra, Polydeuces and Castor
Helen is always the daughter of Zeus, and Clytemnestra the daughter of Tyndareus, Leda's mortal husband
With Castor and Polydeuces, things are more complicated
Some sources say they're both mortal, some they're both divine
If only one is divine, it's always Polydeuces
Which are the sets of twins is another debate; some say the kids were segregated in the eggs according to gender, so the twins are Helen-Clytemnestra and Castor-Polydeuces
Other say they're according to parentage, making the twins Helen-Polydeuces and Castor-Clytemnestra
At any point, Polydeuces and Castor are always called twins (though they're technically half-brothers), while Helen is Poly's only full-sibling
For context: The Greek word for "elevator" is "ασανσέρ" which is basically a phonetic transcription of French "ascenseur"
I've seen "ασανσέρ" translated to English as "asanser" on a sign
In greek the word "παϊδάκια" translates to "ribs" while the word "παιδάκια" translates to "children". So you imagine how hilarious it seems when a restaurant's menu says that it serves "children".
Bougatsa, which is a type of pastry that's usually filled with cream, translated as cream pie
[Does this count ?] Not really a translation
It'll have to be a listing on an e-shop for a children's Lalaloopsy backpack
Apparently the original material must have used something along the lines of "Lalaloopsy school backpack with kitty pattern". Someone in that e-shop decided that google translate alone was enough for the Greek translation and the listing came out as "Σχολή σακίδιο Lalaloopsy κούκλα μοτίβο με το μουνί", or  "Scholí sakídio Lalaloopsy koúkla motívo me to mouní", mouní being Greek sex slang for vagina
Please no use the asanser for more of 4 persons
Get a cream pie from your local bakery
I second your complaint
We got "Last exit: Rita Hayworth".
Well, that's dope
Hope it's a big step towards the better
Our islands, at least some of them are a free for all for tourists, mostly English, to get black out drunk and do stupid things
I don't mind it, in fact it can be a lot of fun when you're younger, I would just prefer if they weren't violent
Then again when the tourists fight they are so drunk they're not really a danger to anyone but themselves
Mostly by banning certain travel agencies and single Brits
For a while, UK travel agencies would book (mostly low income) groups of Brits, they'd arrive at Malia, got themselves drunk as heck, had sex on the street etc
Today it was 32, which is hot but ok hot
Next week it's gonna be 38-39 for several days (which qualifies for a heatwave)
Mid July to mid August it's usually brutal and I have heard it's gonna be **worse** than last year
The actual hot weather is supposed to start monday here
Well it's around 30-35°C every day, I live 5 minutes from the sea and I have a/c so it's ok
I worked a week with my dad on a truck in the middle of Athens with no a/c and I almost lost consciousness a few times (we had to deliver everything by 12 pm so we were running around stressed a lot)
Other than that it's normal summer time
The nights are always hotter
On May we had 42 in Crete, and was the same in many areas last year too
With a bit of carefulness we'll go through it again
I was being a bit dramatic with the "losing consciousness" Part but the heat is still painfull, and the elementary kids got their free milk that day with no one harmed
Sadly, neither our homes are built to dissipate heat
Even though I'm Greek, and we are pretty homogeneous as a country while also being a unitary state instead of a federation, I also feel very different, and it's not just me
Greeces establishment as a state was after 1820s. The liberetion of Northern parts came only after 1910s. To add on that many refugees came from Asia minor and Pontus during that period
Sole other parts of Greece, such ad Dodecanese Islands became part of Greece during late 40s.
People mainly in Pelloponisos and Sterea Ellada or Attica, the first parts that were liberated, feel more Greeks than for example Pelloponisians
Where I come from, from Macedonia, I first and foremost feel Macedonian and then Greek
Not to a big extend , but there is still this distinction in my mind
In general northern Greece is really different from Southern or Central
Macedonians, Epirotes, Thessalians, Thracians feel more connected to their respected areas (or simply Northeners) and then Greeks Fter that
These are my observations
In Northern Greece people might identify more to the region where they come from and then as Greeks
This does not really apply to the ones from Southern or Centeal (both mainland ) Greece
To me , it has to do more with the fact that Pelloponisos and Sterea Ellada were liberated first among others
Northern Greeks dont have that much in common with Southerns, mainly in culture , lifestyle etc
There are even differences between Noerthrners
For example me as a Macedonian dont have that much common ground with Epirotes when it comes in culture or food
Of course we speak the same language , with some dialectical changes, but still
It's really weird
In Greece, everyone says Agrinio is the ugliest and most boring city but i can't confirm it since i have never been there
Athens
Sometimes it's called as one of the most ugliest cities in Europe
i live there, can confirm
Because it's a fact
This is one of the few times in my life I really prefer america's way on this over central europe's.
It is no one's business what you do if it doesn't hurt anyone in any way, and no one should have a reason to shame you for it
Yes, please do stop people from yelling in public, or annoying passersby with "Can I tell you about jesus". But no one should have a say at what you wear (nudity in front of minors being the exception) or whether you do like jesus a lot, but in private
same
My point is that appropriateness and such superficial societal standards are things societies should be leaving in the past, not enforcing
Article 1 [Parliamentary Democracy]
(1) Greece is a Parliamentary Democracy with a President as Head of State
(2) Popular sovereignty is the foundation on which the form of government rests
(3) All powers are derived from the People, exist for the benefit of the People and the Nation, and are
exercised in the manner determined by the Constitution
Article 1
The form of government of Greece is that
of a parliamentary republic
Popular sovereignty is the foundation of
government
All powers derive from the People and
exist for the People and the Nation; they shall
be exercised as specified by the Constitution
It's similar to the Greek one
Sounds about right
The police here are
well, pigs
A lot of them are young, repressed people who follow right-wing ideologies
This is especially true with the new government that has been elected
Yeah
sorry about that
Yeah toilets in Athens are not a thing and it pisses me off, being a person that drinks 3-4 liters per day
Once I couldn't hold it and I had to ask the station manager if they had a toilet
At least she was kind enough to unlock one that is intended for handicapped people
Hahaha that is nuts, who the hell gets arrested twice in another country
Must be a crazy indeed
You are right about the other thing, not necessarily young, but most often than not they are (at least here)
That is VERY alarming to me, because these people want to be cops
And like Yanis Varoufakis once said about politicians "If you WANT to be a politician, that's the wrong reason
You should become a politician because you have to, not because you want to", similarly I think the same can be applied if you want to be a cop in highly police-corrupted countries
Ahahaha sounds like a cool teacher though ;)
That's fucking odd for sure
Ah he was on the other side of trouble then, shit
Which part of your country do you feel most sorry for
For example, in northern Greece there is a city called Ptolemaida (37,000 residents) which is right next to the EU's largest lignite mine
The economy of the town is entirely dependent on the mine and the negative effects of the mine are well known
The residents have the lowest life expectancy in Greece and cancer rates are abnormally high
Every year the mine gets larger and swallows up more and more villages
Everyone in Greece feels sorry for these people
Sometimes, they can even be nasty about it ("Don't touch someone from Ptolemaida
They might give you cancer
Do you have something equivalent in your country
Residents who just seem to live in the worst area or be victims of some industrial/natural disasters
Αυτο δεν το ηξερα
Same with Ptolemaida
The residents don't want the mine to close even though they know it's slowly killing them
IIRC there is a plan in place to completely phase out lignite by 2028, however ΔΕΗ has already invested something like €950m to Ptolemaida V power unit project so it's up for debate how that will be handled and how that will affect the residents livelihood
>phase out lignite by 2028
Are we going to use compressed fart gases then
"The government aims for wind, solar and hydroelectric power to account for at least 35% of Greece's energy consumption by 2030"
Other articles on this very subject state *renewable* *energy* *sources* without going into details, the above was the most specific I could find
Idk dude, it's definitely a bold and environmentally conscious move, but fuck knows how it will play out considering the layered mismanagement that seems to be ever present in Greece, unemployment issues, polarisation instead of constructive debate in public opinion, and the inherent corruption of an elitist self serving system
The Greek Civil war was fought between the Greek government army (supported by the United Kingdom and the United States) and the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE) — the military branch of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) (supported by Yugoslavia, Albania and Bulgaria) from 1946 to 1949
The Soviet Union avoided sending aid
The fighting resulted in the defeat of the DSE by the Hellenic Army
The struggle was one of the first conflicts of the Cold War and represents the first example of Cold War postwar involvement on the part of the Allies in the internal affairs of a foreign country
Not many people are aware that during World War 1, half of the country was sort of "friednly" occupied by Entente forces (mostly French), the king wanted neutrality (he was pro-German), the PM and (now) historical leader Venizelos wanted to join Entente, so he invited them in Thessaloniki, which they militarily occupied
Later the Entente had enough of the king, so the French bombed Piraeus and pushed the king's troops out of Athens
The king abdicated and fled, and we joined Entente
This is also thanks to German admiral Canaris, who was sabotaging Hitler, so he persuaded Franco that it is not in his benefit to join the war
Taking his advice, Franco was asking absurd things from Hitler in order to join, knowing that he could not give them to him
Also the first use of napalm bombs
Also people don't know that the RAF bombed civilian working class neighborhoods in Athens something that not even the nazis did
It was also the start of the Trotsky-Stalin rift
Trotsky was leader of the army and Stalin was general in a unit (he was below Tukachevsky in rank)
Tukachevsky (with Trotsky's agreement) had ordered Stalin to stop the siege of Lwow and join his army in the Vistula near Warsaw
Stalin ignored him, the Polish codebreakers had decrypted the Soviet radio messages and in a pincer movements encircled the Soviet Army and from there pushed them back all the way to Belaurs
It is rumoured that it is also one of the reasons that the Soviets were hating the Polish more than the other nations they ruled over for the rest of the century post-WW2
Not feeding that one stray cat that sleeps outside your house everyday
What kind of heartless person would see the poor thing starving and do nothing about it
Trying to follow the rules and do things properly, without trying to pull any favors or find someone from the inside
Mind blowing, I know
I think most cold countries/regions
Especially places that it snows in the winter
Also most of the near east
I wish all cities had Dutch-like bicycle infrastructure
Unlike many languages where the word for the Moon (Moon, Mond, Luna) can apply to any moon in the solar system, Greek has a word which only applies to this Moon; Selene
When writing numbers we use , to signify decimals and . for thousand
For example 130
400
000,024
According to the Greek grammar, **all** **proper names** need a definite article and are to be used with it (in the appropriate gender, case and number) at **all** times
I wonder if any other languages have this
We have a lot in common with many other European languages in terms of grammar and vocabulary
If there is something that sets us apart it´s the alphabet
I know it was used by the Karamanlides to write the Turkish language, and Wikipedia suggests a few other occasions Greek script was used for writing other languages ( [ ), but no other language uses it today afaik
I know Finnish has this as well, but it's still rare
The way we treat names
We conjugate names like we do ordinary nouns, we use articles for them and we also have a vocative case for when we're calling for someone
E.g suppose someone's name is Giorgos
• "Giorgos is here" would be "**Ο Γιώργος** είναι εδώ" (Nominative)
• "Giorgos' house" would be "Το σπίτι **του Γιώργου**" (Genitive)
• "Call Giorgos" would be "Τηλεφώνησε σ**τον Γιώργο**" (Accusative)
• "Giorgos, come here" would be "**Γιώργο,** έλα εδώ" (Vocative)
Selene to koritsi tou mai
If anyone's wondering, that's pronounced /Se'lini/ and it's the equivalent of Latin "Luna".
We say no by making  a "ts" sound (kinda)
> Gender neutral and uncomplicated (no extra meaning like “friend”) word for boyfriend/girlfriend
Using "kæreste" is what made me fall deeper in love with Danish, it's just so wholesome and cute
Same with μαλάκα which is a common Greek slang word that has a variety of meanings like wanker or asshole
Most countries use comma as the decimal separator
In my experience, what surprises foreign people who learn Greek is that we use it in front of first names and surnames
Other than that, it's not that different from what you'll find say in German
With that said, Wikipedia says Portuguese and Catalan too use the article with first names
I've been told it can be used in Argentinian Spanish too (eg el José)
I see what you did there
From my understanding, a lot of science fiction writers use "Luna" for the name of the Moon, but it's official name in English actually is the Moon, and Luna is Spanish and Italian (and Latin)
And yes, Selene is the moon goddess and the moon itself; for ancient Greeks, the god *was* the object
To try and separate them/see them as distinct is entirely modern
> there are 18 cases in total, I think no European language has more
That'd be correct, Finnish has 15
Unpopular opinion here, but I totally prefer winter hour
I get the impression that it's always early with winter hour and you have more "me". Instead with summer time, the hours go by like running water
Summer
But please stop switching, it's pointless and annoying
A hate clock changes about as much as I hate admitting this but I think the system works well enough as it is
It's the best of both worlds tbh
I prefer winter time
I like waking up in the morning not in the fucking night to go to work ! On those damn winter morning you can get a glimpse of the sun when you take the car to go to your job and by the time you return is already night anyway
Could someone care to explain everyone doesn't like switching time 2 days per year
I think keeping winter time would be nice
I wouldn't love to wake up to a dark sky
Don't mind coming back home to one, I'm quite a night owl
100% summer time cause i'd rather wake up before sunrise than have sun down at 6-7 pm
Summertime so it becomes night time between 20:00-21:00
I don't like it when it becomes night at 17:30
Maybe it doesn't for the northern countries where there's not much sunlight anyway, but in the south where it's abundant, one hour difference can be cumbersome as the day becomes larger
In the election of 2019 the Golden Dawn (fascist) party didn't get any seats in the parliament
Athens would be amazing
I wanna see gta where you're a chav
Athens would be ideal from a landscape perspective
Mountains surrounding it making it a basin, and the sea is right there
Just keep the explosives away from the Parthenon and we’re good
Crete
They already drive like they're in GTA there and most are armed to the teeth (trust me in from there)
So basically Crete
Shops in tourist areas put small water bottles in outrageous prices 500ml 2,5€  and for 750ml 3,5€ similar to Paris
When the 500ml bottle is 0,50€ and the 750ml 0,75€
Dare I say Mykonos
Yes, I do
What I hear when some foreigner saying that they want to visit Mykonos is that they want to experience what many other Aegean islands have to offer at an impossibly high price
Unless you are loaded, Mykonos might be pretty but it's not worth it
If you are really set on visiting the island, maybe do so for a day or so just to seen Little Venice and a wind mill or two and then run away as fast as possible without looking back, because not even a glare is free of charge there
Santorini and mykonos
Everything is overpriced there and almost no Greeks visit that place anymore because of that and tourist overpopulation
Athens in general as a city
(Greece)
Ios and Mikonos islands
Mykonos
Super overpriced for what it's worth
Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful island, just overhyped
Every highly populated island has nightlife as well as rowdy beach bars
Most of these examples though don't charge 50 euros for a salad
I sat inside, and I agree it's more pricey for Portuguese standards, but it's still cheap
The natinhas though are quite different from any other, and also they're always hot as they constantly bake them
Not better, just different
Same thing happened in Greece though they didn't banned Uber but the option where non taxi drivers can sign up use their car and take rides
Wow, I knew some things about the taxis in Turkey but this changes the whole perspective
I'm definitely using Uber when I get to visit your country
Sorry, i was carried away
Maybe an equivalent of Uber
My most usual breakfast is some kind of pastry thing (spanakopita, croissant, or whatever something along the lines of that) with greek/turkish coffee
I eat yoghurt with honey frequently
I love olive oil and may or may not overuse it sometimes during cooking
In the summer I nap for about an hour after lunch, and I complain if there's even 2-3 clouds in the sky
Idk what other stereotypes there are
first from Greece
oh well
I'm so atypical that people from other countries that have been to Greece or met Greeks never perceive me as Greek (unless I tell them)
most of the times they think I'm from Spain
LOL
some things that I don't do as typical Greek:
- drink tsipouro or ouzo
- go out to a  taverna
- go to skiladika (doghouses, big halls with live greek music)
- listen to greek music (I mean at all)
- go to the beach in the summer to spend hours under the sun to get a tan
- visit greek islands
- buy excessive groceries
if I want one banana and three apples, I buy one banana and three apples
and a lot more
when I did a questionnaire about which european country fits someone the most my result was Norway
Stereotypes I don’t fit
I am not really fond of the sea,I prefer the mountains
I hate the sun ,i love cloudy weather .
I absolutely despise feta cheese
I am not friendly
I am never late
I don’t like ouzo,I prefer vodka
Stereotypes i fit
I can’t currently think of anything
I have lots of cousins, most of which I’m close with
I love the sea and the sun
I can eat mountains of feta
Not loud and extroverted, though
We all know that the only place in France from which you can't see the Eiffel Tower is it's interior
Presents feta, you called for salty
What can I even say about Greece
It's either a paradise if we're talking about one of the popular islands, or a very poor and filthy country (both in how it looks but also the people)
I distinctively remember a Scooby Doo episode that I watched when I was younger where the gang went to Athens I think, and there was this weird, creepy guy who didn't really speak English and who kept freaking them out
And the general look of the place was very dark, very gloomy and dirty looking, and the only thing that you could see was ancient Greek ruins
No houses or any other modern-ish looking building
But I may not remember everything correctly about that last thing
And the pastries
Don't forget the pastries
It's quite infuriating when they portray all of Greece as being on a coast
We have lots of mountains, people
And they're way more beautiful than the barren, overpriced, overrated islands
I've been refusing to watch this movie my whole life
I will die on this hill
Not exactly about the EU, but about Erasmus (which is an EU program)
I had seen a video claiming that Erasmus was created so young people from different countries would hook up and eventually some of them would have kids
Having kids with parents of different nationalities would help to mix different European nationalities together
Edit: The point the video was making was that this (young people making babies) is the primary goal of Erasmus
According to the video the academic and culture exchange goals of the program are just cover-up
We have some crazy stories about alien origins that I am too ashamed to even joke about
Do you write 'α' or 'a' ?
as far as i know everybody in Greece writes α
I write **α**. **a** Is a bit harder to write for me, I tried it a few times but it looked completely wrong
In addition, it's the same as in Greek, which makes it easier
I am writing α all the time, I tried doing the English a and I can't
so pretty much everyone in the comments says they write α
so then why don't they change it in general, it's normal for languages and alphabets to evolve,though it has stopped these days because of how well documented everything is but if everything was in handwriting i'm sure α would be normal and a would become history
Since we're talking handwriting here
Is it weird that my æ kinda looks like a φ? I'll make an edit with a pic asap lol
Edit: [I'm a boomer when it comes to imgur I hope I've done this correctly]
i kinda did the same with f,y and g mostly cause of maths but originaly because my teacher said my g looked like a 9 and i could get less points in my english proficiency exams (when i changed g i also did y because they have similar shapes)
Nah she was just looking out for me it was like a suggestion because in these exams the guys who correct them would simply give you a bad grade if they had trouble reading your hand writing because they correct so many exams they have no tolerance
Yeah she was a good teacher but as you can see my english had gotten very rusty lmao
Thanks it's just that I noticed a few mistakes in my comments, but if you say it's fine then it is have a good one
We mostly are joking about taking back Konstantinopole (Instabul)
However it is worrying that there are quite a few people who believe that someday we are going to retake it
... I mean
I'm sure the same is true for my Balkan friends too
Not this time spaghetti man
> However it is worrying that there are quite a few people who believe that someday we are going to retake it
I seriously wonder what they *think* we're supposed to do with the millions of Turks living there
I think that the people who are actually willing to attack Turkey are extremely few, even compared to the ones that believe in a retaking some time in the future
It's more of a wishful thinking by a part of the population than a realistic idea of the majority
Contrary to what *ahem* certain countries have been led to believe
God will disappear them (to hell ?), of course
I have exactly the same question
I'm in
Let me tell you about the year 285 AD and a mad lad called Diocletian :D
Back then the empire was indeed called Eastern Roman Empire however the majority of its population was greek
The city of Constantinople thrived and ruled  inhabited mostly by greeks so i don't think citizens of the city of Rome would be interested
Why the hell we would want to take Iran
Cause of Alexander the Great
Greek soldiers never gunned down Syrian refugees
ummmmmmmmm no
Very little coverage by the Greek media
And about the protests, I'm supporting them ofc
Hopefully Lukashenko will be resigned soon, together with Trump, Johnson, Bolsonaro, Orban, Vucic, Putin, Erdogan & co
I don't really watch the news in TV but as far as I know, Belarus wasn't even mentioned
I know about the situation from Reddit and Twitter
I don't watch tv but I do see it on online Greek media
Atm though we also have had deadly floodings with several dead (among them, a baby), and Turkey problems
They also have just started talking about the dictator in Belarus winning the elections and how Putin congratulates him, so that's the 'news' from Belarus for the day
This is what I could find about specifically the protests, in different Greek popular sites of various political backgrounds (left, right):
It's in Greek, but if you're interested you could Google translate the pages to see how they view it
* Proto Thema  [
* EF SYN [
* NEWS247  [
* To Vima  [
* Athinaiko-Makedoniko Praktoreio Eidisewn  [
the rest sites reproduce the above pretty much
In some sites it was easy to find in the front page, and in others I had to use the search bar
It's weird to have dictatorship within Europe nowadays, especially when the other leaders look away
I doubt our media knows that Belarus is even exist
If it was happened in a country like Venezuela or Iran it would've been a hot topic here but since it's happening in a obscure country like Belarus they won't give a single damn
I saw many reports about the protests in Lebanon in the Greek media but nearly nothing about Belarus
Radio stations and TV channels
Like why aren't there any nationwide channels and radio stations broadcasting the same content at the same time
(ot adjusted, considering time zones)
You should go to Turkey
They're their European equivalent as far as flag displays go
-Hi my name is Kevin Im calling from blabla how are you this afternoon
-I... Sorry Kevin I... I dont think Im prepared for this
-Dont worry friend the sun is still shining, whats there that cant be resolved
-Uh
ah *proceeds to go to the bathroom to explosively puke*
Our government has done some horrible and despicable things
And definitely still is
It's reasonable to fear the US government
I'll beam it to the politicians
Imagine being an American and reading this
Grenade attacks
Could you please elaborate
I can't choose so I'm gonna mention two :)
Kastoriá! It's a stunningly beautiful town in northern Greece, right next to a lake, and it's a good kept secret because it's not faithful to the stereotypical "Greek dream" (sun, beaches)
Métsovo
That's more of a village than a city but its natural beauty stands out a lot
It has an altitude of 1
160m making it a perfect winter destination, houses are made in a beautiful stone/wooden style and the local food is PHENOMENAL
Well kind of the opposite but Athens is considered by almost If not all Greeks the ugliest city in Greece
italian:
kazzo = dick,
puzza = something like "you smell",
tutti = all,
nero = black,
pizza = pizza (obv
greek:
(na) katso = to sit,
poutsos/poutsa = dick,
touti = her,
nero = water,
petsa = skin,
(also portuguese peão = pawn (?), greek peos = penis)
(also also english penis = penis, greek peinas = you're hungry)
Spanish mesa (table) means indoors/inside in Greek
That's what y'all get for having "skat" as a word of endearment
Germany or Poland
I love those countries
Efficient and really typical in everything
I have travelled a lot to both countries and each time i am flabbergasted about the minimum time you need to do anything
But both languages, especially the german one is a pain to learn
Most German words, seem to come out throught scrabble
The one with the highest points get to go on the german dictionary
Denmark ️
France , and paris in particular
I visited once and I was astonished
I haven't visited many european countries yet so it's a bit biased
As much as I want to travel around I can't imagine myself living anywhere else other than Greece so I'd just move to Heraklion (from a town near Athens)
Next closest thing, Italy
Greece is nice, but Switzerland is nice too
Island life can be tough however especially in the winter
First time ever hearing of it
Also I didn't know that that was the French I thought it was the standard
I only know it bcs I lived  for some time in Madrid
I doubt anyone uses it in Greece
YES
Not just the elderly
Where I come from they should be doing annual driving tests from 18 and up
We have so many car accidents we lose the amount of people the equivalent of a town, every year
Plus the drivers behavior is awful
They park on every pavement, block streets, make noise at 3am with loud music, etc
Add to that if someone is old and feels entitled and you got yourself one of the biggest daily life problems in Greece
Yes, totally
You can't expect the cognitive functions of a 65+ year old person to be at 100%. In my opinion many elderly drivers are an increased threat to themselves and other drivers/pedestrians
The ideal answer to this is an upgraded infrastructure system that plans for groups like elderly people and people with disabilities, maybe a dedicated bus line or something similar
In general, when a place has solid and efficient infrastructure to offer, sometimes cars can be the worse choice
Why drive 45 minutes downtown when a train can get you there in 20
25+ is hot
20 to 25 is warm
15 to 20 is alright
10 to 15 is chilly
3 to 10 is cold
-5 to 3 is fairly cold
Below -5 it's freezing
Anything bellow 20 is Chilly
Anything bellow 10 is deadly cold
Around 20°C chilly
10°C to 15°C cold
Below that we are getting into freezing territory
But both my parents house and the place I live and study are by the sea and generally have milder Temps
People in the mountainous areas of Greece will have much lower Temps to report
For summer anything less than 22⁰C or so is cold
And for winter anything less than 10⁰C.
In general, I'd say below 10 it's time to throw on a jacket, below 5 maybe add some gloves to that
Lower than gloves needed it's snowing where I am
Anything below 25-20°C, anything higher it's avg greek weather
Heyyyy, a Southern European who agrees with me
I know we're not as tolerant to cold as our northern bros, but the people above saying jacket at 20 had me going crazy
Oh yeah definitely
For me 10-20 is hoodie weather, above 20 is t-shirt weather and below 10 is jacket weather, if I wore a jacket at 20° I'd decompose
A map of europe but words
these
Wars,history and europe(the lady the continent got its name from)
I just picture the EU, a map of it, and that one picture with the flags lined up
Everyone in Europe says Europe lol
It’s a great name after all
I love winters, there is something romantic and warm being inside with friends playing board games and drinking while it's cold or even snowing outside
It's good
I'm from Greece
We have basically the same climate here as Melbourne
To be honest the winters here are short and not very cold
The annoying part is the early spring though because one day it could be t-shirt temperature and the next could be full coat temperature
But you are allways drinkingi  feel taht the lack of sun is just an excuse
same here
Australia sounds like a nice place to live honestly(except the spiders and the sharks and everything that can probably kill you)
Always the party that gave me hopes, even if it doesn't represent my ideology, if it gives hope that it will do good, then it has my vote
Yet all of them have never failed to disappoint me
In a national level, the lesser evil
In a more local level, I have voted for someone who genuinly seemed to want to make things better, but she didn't win
Once as a young and naive 19 year old I really believed in the party I chose and the political system in general
Now I truly believe a revolution or at least a corruption purge is in order
I belong to the 40% (roughly) of voters who choose not to vote
For the lesser evil ofc
All Greek political parties are ABSOLUTELY godawful
Sadly there's not a single political party which is really close to me
Greece has the most amount of smokers in the European Union which is understandable considering how cheap it is to smoke in Greece and the majority of Eastern Europe
Every fucking one smokes here
And the thing is I despise smoking and cigarettes it makes me actually sick
I have sworn to myself I'll never smoke
very common, almost everyone does it and it's treated like a normal thing
[wikipedia says] that 37% of Greeks were smokers as of 2017 but it doesn't look like there is any more recent data
Among the youth especially, most smoke on occasion, and it is very widely regarded as unhealthy and stinky
I honestly can't think of another regular smoker in my circle of friends
Ok πεοστύφτη
You could join a car club it's a common thing in Europe , the down side is that I know only of European car make clubs or even Japanese but no American ones
Just say Alexander the Great was not Greek and you can create an army with torches and pitchforks
When we get stalled at the airport when abroad, because they think our ID card is fake
Once, i was asked for a passport because in their words "the ID is written only in Cyrillic"! 1
The ID has english in it too, 2
Cyrillic
Really
In Greek we call the Netherlands "Ολλανδία" (lit
just Holland) and the Dutch "Ολλανδοί" (Holland-ers)
Only if someone wants to sound fancy will they say "Κάτω Χώρες" (Nether-lands)
Took me a while to stop calling the country "Holland" in English as well
Sorry
And we still don't have a word for Dutch
Sorry, but you are all Hollanders for us
God I physically cringed
pathetic attempt at trolling tbh
Yes, by a couple of monks that adapted it to the needs of the Slavs
Oh man I get it, imagine if the whole of Greece was just called Attika and the people Atticians or something, that would pretty much trigger a civil war, to be honest
We are capable of handling a health crisis
Damn Italians with their colonies
leave
Like swim
Well we mostly fucked ourselves but the way Germany handled it wasnt the ideal rom economic perspective
Idk Dave it sounds logical
What do you mean they cant come back
they cand find the way back or you prohibit them by law to come back
My (quite long) experience with beaches in Greece (islands and mainland since the 70s and the 80s) is that it used to be more than 50% - especially in the 80s: it was like there was an unwritten rule for women that they must go topless, especially British and German women
Other nationalities were not as keen
It is fa, far less now, probably because of the fear of the sun
Greek here
Less than 1 in 10 is about right
unless you're a very small kid or in a nudist beach it's 0% (in Greece at least)
used to be a lot but since it became common knowledge that sunbathing can cause skin cancer a lot less
Early modern and middle are fine, and I can get the scottish text but I don't ùnderstand every single word
The other two are indecipherable to me
Why did English drop ð and æ? I can understand dropping æ in favour of a simple a in place, but why ð? It's more compact than "th".
In the first Monday of Lent the town of Tyrnavos celebrates the Feast of Phallus or Burani
There are times when Christ looks the other way to humour the old gods
Every time former PM Tsipras opened his mouth to say something in English, he's top meme material over here on this subject
Nothing recent though, since our current one speeks  perfect English, sadly no memes there
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you one Alexis Tsipras, our previous prime minister
i would like to introduce to you [Alexis Tsipras]
[another video of him]
in [this instance] he is trying to say "we have eaten the donkey, and now all that's left is the tail" it's a Greek saying and he butchered it
I don't know if you know Tsipras (former Prime Minister of Greece) ... Won't say more, [I'll let the man speak for himself]
It has to be Alexis Tsipras' "Madam Merkellll" I don't have a link right now but please check it out
Because of his inability to speak English properly even at a basic level he has become a laughing stock among the people
Yeah, I remember the clip of Mitsotakis in the White House to give you an idea of how well he speaks the English language
Trump was shouting at reporters saying the absolute same words over and over again for the majority of that meeting, while Mitsotakis spoke for a handful of minutes and spoke with a better vocabulary and better linguistic cohesion than the President of the United States
Another great interview was with historian Niall Ferguson
I was shocked at the time Clinton was making fun of him for not being able to understand English or not making sense when he was speaking
That’s the moment I decided I’m never going to vote for that guy
He just humiliated our country at an international level
Trump bought his way through education, there's former associates of his claiming he doesn't know jack-sh\*t on many subjects, he just pays associates most of the time to do the thinking for him (though I think that's apparent from the crazy yiayia+taxi driver bs he'd spout for the virus)
It's also apparent from the way he always speaks like he's on that reality show of his or maybe some fashion police-style show
You know that movie with Voutsas and Moustakas playing two almost illiterate rich men
Think that but limited to Trump himself
Well tbf even Tsipras speeks better English than Trump lmao
Jk Mitsotakis English is on an academic level, it's always pleasant to hear him, not to mention that he speeks also German and French if I'm not mistaken
That’s exactly what I think too
He grew up with money and he thought to himself, “I don’t need education, it’s only a money-making tool
I already have money”.
Well, it doesn’t work that way
You can’t be the President of the United States and be illiterate
Hahaha I absolutely get the movie reference
You’re absolutely correct
Hahahah that’s an extreme statement
I recently heard Tsipras on an interview with Sroiter on Alpha and he kinda dropped a few financial terms in English, showing off what he’s learned
Guess who’s got a tutor
Yeah, to the point that when you’ve heard Mitsotakis in English, he kinda sounds boring in Greek
He’s way more articulate and expressive in English
He is a very well educated person, his French is great too
Once upon a time, a pretty big group of people went down Greece, found a nice place, slaughtered the locals and kept the rest as slaves
And that's how Sparta came to be
Once there was Asia, and then there was a really short 20 year old man
You know the rest
I played a game about this called my child lebensborn, it was about a Norwegian man adopting a kid that had German nationality (propably through rape)
The game takes place right after ww2 and its a really sad game because the kid keeps getting called nazi and bullied because of his origins
Was that really how Sparta was formed
Any sources for this
Asia minor catastrophe
it was, they kept the locals as slaves for generations to come to, known as the [helots] Appart from wikipedia my only other source is the greek school system, unfortunately I can't link to that
to be fair, yeah this kinda stuff happened a lot at 1300 BC
Sincere question, would it be controversial to say Alexander was greek
Cause I only know how we and Macedonia view him, so dunno what's the global consensus
Wait, what did you or us do
I've never heard that in school, thanks for the source tho
exactly like that actually
The Macedonia thing is political issue only and it's just about the name
The claims of ancient Macedonians being related to North Macedonia is not taken seriously by anyone at least important
So it's 100% safe to say it
Ps: Alexanders family doesn't even originate from Macedonia they come from Argus in South Greece hence the name  Argead dynasty comes from
Alexander the Great was Greek fam
Like it's not even up for a debate
He spread Hellenism to every place he conquered, he was born in Pella, spoke greek as his first language
These are all facts you can look up yourself
Not even up for debate
Δεν μαθατε για τους ειλωτες και το Σπαρτιατικο συστημα δουλειας ?
I was talking about the modern one tbh since the previous ones were never "Greece", it wasn't even that much of a concept in ancient times
Δε θημαμε κάτι
It's rumored he was very compassionate about his soldiers, but really fucking stupid when it came to their needs
For example there's a tale about him saying "if you can't drink, then neither will I" and spilling his waterskin on the sand as they were crossing a dessert and dying from dehydration
He tried to show compassion, but **spilled his water** instead of fucking **sharing** it
Alexander the Great wasn't such a great guy
Agreed , in the end nationalism hurts both sides and the arms race is rediculus
We could have been spending more money in healthcare  inferstraction  education  and technology, yet both countries buy and create weapons with all that money
Δευτερελθόθλιψη (Dhefterelthóthlipsi)
There, I just created it for you too
Sure does, look at what the Madman Aristophanes has created on this basis [here]
It means Monday coming sadness (Δευτέρα+ελθ+θλίψη) that's why I'm not using Sunday
There are many in Greece, all the year long
but  like there
Same date ..24/6
fires, dances, songs, ... The name of the festival "klidonas" young girls suppose to learn their future husband's name
Is the start of summer,  and  celebrate the new wheat(and what ever else) picked up from the fields
Am Greek-American but we celebrate our name days every year in honor of our names' patron saints
My mom did the klidonas, she saw someone with curly hair inside a wooden boat paddling but the boat was on a field of wildflowers, not the sea
The moment she saw him she recognised him and it turns out he was a carpenter
She said yes imediately which surprised her family since they had many suitors but she disliked all of them
Then years later my mom's friend decided to do this with her daughter (she had done the other one with the αμίλητο νερό when she was younger)
Her daughter 'saw' a short guy next to a big desk with a weird cursive symbol/logo
I remember her she was totally confused and hated he was short
Years later she got married with a short guy that was working as the official representative of Coca Cola in the region
I never did it
My mom thought I was too young at the time (I was a preteen) and then she thought it won't make a difference and I forgot about it (cause you have to do it on st
john's day if I remember well)
&#x200B;
**GREECE:**
Now, OP, in Greece we have tons of ancient traditions that survived
[Many have to do with religion as it was typical of Christians to adjust religious beliefs through ancient Greek customs and traditions] That was a known tactic as it was helping the new christians relate with it easier
**Wedding rituals**, the  **procession with candles on Good Friday** was taken from eleusinian mysteries (we only know a few things about them), we also still have **lament song in funerals** although now it's rare; my grandma had asked to have the traditional/ancient 3 day funeral with professional lament singers from Mani region and they came and 'cried' for her and sang the songs about Hades and all (it was so fucking cool), we also have the **evil eye** from 6th century BC and the ways of 'eliminating' it, we have the **burning of Judas** on easter, **Ηλιούγεννα (sunbirth)** which was our Xmas, **koliva** a mixture of barley, pomegranates, wheat, nuts, raisins etc that is given in funerals and every time they commemorate the dead, **putting a golden coin under the head of the dead so they can cross river Styx** (we did that secretly from the priest or else he could get so pissed off he could refuse to burry the dead), **απόκριες (carnival)**, **carols**, **blessings**, and a gazillion other things, ouf
I'll piggy back on this one
Koudounofori, bell bearers, in some places in North Greece, as well as North Macedonia and Bulgaria at the start of spring some men will dress with goatfur, masks, sticks and big bells, on the waist, looking very primal, and dance in procession through a village or town ringing the bells in the process to scare evil spirits n shit, never witnessed it myself but want up
It's obviously pre Christian and apparently from Neolithic period
I remember reading Corsica or Sardinia had a very similar tradition too
A greek who doesn't like feta cheese
I'm a Greek who doesn't like tzatziki
A Greek that doesn't like souvlaki, dislikes feta, constant sunny weather and high temperatures all the time ?
a greek that doesn't like souvlaki
A greek who doesn't love souvlaki
Unpopular opinion: Feta cheese is disgusting (most of the time)
i am calling the inquisition to purge this heresy
I'm 189cm in the country of dwarves
:o the one in a million
How dare you D:
Well most are trying but it is difficult with the salaries here
Ο Ήλιος (the sun, male)
Το φεγγάρι (the moon, neuter)
Η Σελήνη (the moon, female)
Well the moon has 2 names one that is the original and one that is for some reason used today so
Sun=Hélios (male)
Moon=Selíni(female)
Also moon=Feggári (neutral)
Ο Ηλίος ( The Sun) male
Το Φεγγάρι (The Moon) neutral
Η Σελήνη (The Moon) feminine
earth: η γη (female), moon: το φεγγάρι (neutral)/η σελήνη (female), sun: ο ήλιος (male)
Ο Ήλιος: male
Ή Σελήνη or Το φεγγάρι: female and neutral
In Greek it's masculine for the sun "ο ήλιος" and neutral for the moon "το φεγγάρι"
o Ílios (masculine) and i Selíni (feminine) in modern Greek :)
[O Chrysoús Aión tou Perikléous] (Pericles' golden century)
For the modern times, I would say the 80s and a bit of the 90s with Andreas Papandreou
Although he raised the national debt, he built most of the universities and he gave a tremendous help to the farmers
Imagine the farmers from the island Crete would fly to Athens to party for the weekend with Cuban cigars and then they would take the first plane in the morning and they would go immediately to work to their greenhouse
There were Mercedes sports cars filled with potatoes that they would deliver them to the city and then they would immediately go to party
It was really bazaar
Then for the medieval times, in the early 1000s there had been a huge boost of the Eastern Roman empire under Basil the second
The empire got doubled, retook the Balkans and it was perfect for everyone living in, except if you were rich
For Greece there are lots of them, Alexander the Great, Golden Age of Periklis and so much more
Although, I personally think that the real golden age of Greece is in the very first years when we started mathematics, sciences, theater and so much more
Yeah, well, yes, but it was 2,500 years ago
We call it the Golden Age of Pericles and it was mainly in Athens, not necessarily the whole of Greece
Back then, the Greeks fought a lot between them
Come to think of it, we still do
not sure if this counts but we see Ancient Greece and Alexander the Great's Macedonia as our Greatest times in history, it's hard to live up to those days
Fifth Century BC - Literally Called the [Golden Century]
This is when basically almost everything you know about ancient greece happened and influenced mankind ever since
Oh and the Age If Alexander The Great
Greece had an empire that spanned up to India and Egypt
I wouldn't call a period in which many people suddenly found themselves with more money than they were used to (or than they could imagine) as 'golden'. The 80s were surely a period of prosperity for Greek people (ασχέτως αν τώρα πληρώνουμε τα σπασμένα, κυριολεκτικά και μεταφορικά), it also opened up education to the vast majority of the population, but, as per your description, just partying and not investing, making research, being creative or excelling intellectually ... what kind of golden is that
The 80s were definitely happy times for Greece, but not golden times imo
Papandreou's era was our golden era
Hope you are joking
The clown state in which we are living today and which tortures us by all possible means, has its foundations back then
Unqualified and rude civil servants, non-existent state support for the citizens' problems, public companies with millions worth of yearly losses and astronomical wages, pensioners under 50, inexplicable tolerance of criminal activities, heavy taxation
It's all the remnants of his "socialistic" policies, which no later dominant political party dared to change
Sure, one or two generations had it all, but guess how many more are being (and will keep getting) fucked because of this "golden era".
Which one would you propose as a golden era in our modern history then
either the PASOK propaganda has worked wonders and people are unironically nostalgic for that era or that many people got so much money without deserving them, but then what pagkalos said and caused outrage is true
sometimes I feel like my family didn't live in Greece cause we never had 5 houses and 10 cars but still we have to pay for the partying others did and it seems it's a majority
As for the medieval times, I totally agree with you
More recently, perhaps during the Balkan wars
We gained/freed a big chunk of today's country and, unlike other periods of our history, we did so only through our army's superiority both at sea and on land, not because of the help of a big ally
Of course you can't compare that to more ancient times, for example during classical Greece, Alexander's period, or even during the 3 centuries of pax Romana when we were the cultural equivalent of today's USA in terms of influence
It's quite difficult for most people, especially for those ignorant of how the economy actually works, to comprehend what happened
They saw only the fat paychecks, the increase in wages and in public spending
Where the heck did this come from
What exactly did we produce to reach such a standard of living
Nothing, the State just kept on loaning and spending the money to establish their ever growing voting base
Even today it is difficult for most Greeks to understand this, despite being so obvious
"It's the Germans to blame, it's the Americans, it's the IMF
Oh my smartphone is from Korea, my router from China, my car from Germany, my TV from Japan, my clothes from Turkey/Malaysia/Taiwan, my money in Swiss banks, my military equipment from the US, all the big logistics companies in Netherlands
But in Greece we can produce everything
It's as simple as that: heavy taxation on every living organism, so that the State has enough to pay for their public servants and pensioners
And then begging big companies to come and invest
it's sad that even in that age where the money was supposedly flowing like a river the morons that they are didn't invest in anything to make their fortune greater or the country's, they just kept buying useless houses, even more useless cars and the rest throw it away at bouzoukia, no planning whatsoever about the future, only to show off now and sadly nothing has changed even after a decade of memorandums and with us learning what our stupidity cost us
Eh it depends, by the time of Nero " provincials" had full right and even someone ftom Spain ¥though still Roman citizen) could become Emperor
*Achtually* the French kings bought the title claims to the Byzantine empire by the last exiled Byzantine prince, so *technically*, and if we even assume the Republic acknowledges these, France is the de jure heir to the Empire
Hey, most Greeks are chill with France
I have never gone to such a trip but I'm sorry for your experience in Greece
If you don't plan things correctly it's easy to have such a trip anywhere
We were in Rome, me and 4 friends around 20 years old
One night we were strolling around and I stopped to check something in a shop which room a while
After going out I couldn't find my friends, I tried calling but no signal
After around 10 minutes I see my friend and he comes running to me and says the others met a guy that gave them coupons to an underground strip club when he learned they were foreign
So we go to the rescue
The place was down a long flight of stairs with two tall buff guys at the entrance
We go down and the place was almost empty with some shady looking guys and a couple of shitty strippers
So we pick them up and leave
It ended up not being a big deal but looking back things could have ended up much worse
OP I'm sorry for your experience
As someone born and raised in Rhodes, my first reaction was to laugh (it's not everyday the island is mentioned in Reddit)
I really liked your narration of the story
I hope you can visit again and actually enjoy the vacation(and the beaches)
I'm Greek  but I've spent some years in england, and imo England outside of London gets very little love
Most of my Greek friends who have been to England for tourism have visited London alone, but English nature is very beautiful and there are lots of nice towns too
Also the whole English ppl are cold and their food is terrible is just a stupid stereotype, for some reason it's okay to trash the English in ways that would be seen as ignorant for any other nation
And the rainfall thing is also not true, ppl could just check Wikipedia
Basically anywhere except Athens Santorini and Mykonos
Northern Greece, with Thessaloniki and Chalkidiki being the only exceptions, is definitely underrated
Greece is similar, the north west in particular is not only mountaineous, it is also rather poor and with less ancient monuments than the rest of the country
Still a very nice place to visit if you know where to go and when
> Still a very nice place to visit if you know where to go and when
Always been a mountain person
I fucking love the northwest
I'll take that over Santorini any time
Can't say for other countries, but yes, in Greece this is the stereotype of the English
Look up Kastoriá, Métsovo, Árta, and Pózar baths, they're all quite beautiful places
I'd say german is more advantageous within european borders, while spanish may serve you better should you cross the atlantic
My suggestion is that, if you find some time after studyimg german, continue on with french as well because they are a gateway to learning both spanish and italian
Definatly russian because of the many russian tourists
The drying rack in the cabinet is pretty common in many homes in Greece too
For anyone interested:
Mercury = Ερμής (Ermis/Hermes)
Venus = Αφροδίτη (Aphrodity/Aphrodite)
Earth = Γη (Gi from the goddess "Gaia")
Mars = Άρης (Aris/Ares)
Jupiter = Δίας (Dias, another name for Zeus)
Saturn = Κρόνος (Kronos, named after the Titan)
Uranus = Ουρανός (Uranos, also used in modern greek to say "sky")
Neptune = Ποσειδώνας (Posidonas/Posidon)
i always use butter for frying eggs didn’t know other mediterranean people literally use olive oil for everything
That's because you haven't visited Greece lol
We definitely have them, I thought they were universal as well
Actual butter or vitam(margarine)
ohh mostly vitam
Figured as much, vitam is mostly solidified palm oil (φοινικέλαιο), that's why it's also allowed for fasting (νηστεία)
> I very rarely hear any kind of appreciation for Danish
I can't stress this enough; I LOVE this language
It soothes my whole being, it sounds so warm and sweet, and the peculiar features of it (blødt D og stød) only make it even better
An unpopular opinion, for whatever reason
> and I’ve heard “why don’t we just switch to English lol” more than once
undskyld men NEJ
yeah ur right lol, i’m dumb i forgot they were different
Jeg lærer det bare for sjov:) jeg tror at det er mærkeligt for nogen i udlandet, fordi de fleste mennesker, der jeg har mødt, der lærer dansk, er i Danmark eller planlægger at bo i Danmark
Jeg er dog ligeglad, for at være ærlig, et sprog behøver ikke være "nyttigt" eller populært for nogen at lære det:)
(jeg håber at jeg har ikke lavet så mange fejl, da jeg er ikke endnu på et højt niveau)
Tusind tak
Probably Georgios Papadopoulos, head of the military junta that ruled Greece for seven years in the 20th century
And the rest of the colonels as well: Markezinis, Ioannidis, and Patakos
Also don't forget the Nazi colaborationist Georgios Tsolakoglou and the kings
He's my hero, for killing a genocidal maniac
>What about Metaxas
He's overlooked
Mainly due to not caving in to Mussolini's ultimatum
Still a disgusting figure no matter how you look him, outside of foreign affairs
>I personally like him since he criticed the asia minor campaign
No offense, but that is seriously very shortsighted; after all military foresight doesn't translate to civic responsibilities
He passed measures that put any dissidents either behind bars or to the firing line
Torture was widespread
He banned assemblies of more than 50 people
He banned the use of any language other than Greek in public spaces
He banned political parties and shutdown the parliament
He introduced equivalents to the Nazi salute and the Hitler youth
Censorship became a part of life
Books by Goethe, George Bernard Shaw, Sigmund Freud, Santayana, and others were gathered and burned in gigantic bonfires
He banned rebetiko
He passed anti Roma legislation
Oh and **he came to power after a coup**, after a referendum for the return of the king was staged
Enver Hoxa made Albania the most secular Southeastern European country with the highest literacy ratio, should Hoxa be celebrated do those things or hated for the million more horrific atrocities committed in Albania during that era
Same thing with Stalin for industrialising the USSR and Kim Il Sung for rebuilding the DPRK
He was a dictator, not a democratically elected
It's like you see a tree but don't see the forest
Metaxas was a dictator but we tend to overlook that because he said "Ochi" to Mussolini
spare a Euro for you Witcher
It's all Greek to me
Really hard I suppose
Does Garteh Bale count
yep, everytime i play csgo and someone spanish talks, i always think they are greek lol
Yes, as long as living expenses etc are able to support it
There is no point in working less if I have to "pay" it in another way
Armenia because their people, in my experience at least, really like us Greeks
Serbia for more or less the same reason
Serbians and Armenians are our bros for life
Britain and their allies, NZ & Aus, who fought and died in my country against our common enemies and not just in one war
Our debt to them can never be repaid
We owe them so much
Finally Haiti too
Haiti was the very first state to recognize the existence of the Greek State
Having only recently become independent themselves, they were the only ones who could understand our struggle for freedom
And even though they must have had myriad problems of their own,  they still spared effort and attention for us, and what little they did, was still huge
I would thank Great Britain for storing temporarily our marbles in top condition
I will thank them again when they are returned
You didn't specifically ask but Greeks can fully communicate with Cypriots but we can tell them apart from their accent
However if they want they can speak with a heavy accent and throw in some Cypriot words and we have a lot of trouble understanding them
Greece/Cyprus
They understand us but we do not understand them
Every time your president says something awkward, stupid or outrageous
That's almost daily
Pre-Trump the US was mentioned once a week, to give you an idea
Everyday, they are neutral torwards the US but they do report on anything bad happening
for example California or Trump's incompetence
usual news
Yes, especially with what is happening with Turkey and California
More often than not though, it's usually about cr\*p Trump does, especially the racist bs and dumb stunts he pulls to get re-elected
>Thats more like minute by minute
Well yes, but we sum it all up in a 5min broadcast, cause  otherwise our politicians wouldn't get any TV time to tell their own awkward, stupid, outrageous BS
An amazing day to you too ;)
I don't know for sure
The only way I consider myself European is because my country belongs to the EU and because most European countries share the same religion and are close geographically, so I guess that's a common thing we have
Yeah, maybe, idk
I probably consider myself more of a Balkan or South European, because our culture has more similarities with Spain, Italy, Serbia, Montenegro etc than with Sweden, Germany, England etc
Honestly, imo, the only reason why most Greeks want to consider themselves Europeans, and not Asians, for instance, is because of Germany, England and other Northern and/or Western European countries that are very wealthy and powerful
Which means that by adopting the "European identity" they want to be associated with them, and not with the poor developing countries of Asia, Africa etc
or the countries of USSR, since people of poorer countries are usually looked down on and are considered inferior, in some way
Indeed, some people might see it that way
But this is mostly an excuse Greek people use to be associated with rich European countries
Current Greek culture is is very different from Germany, Norway, Iceland etc
In many cases we have more in common with Jews and Turks, than we have with Danish and English, for instance
It's a little bit complicated
Santorini and Mykonos
There's a ton of other places that are not visited which are a must go
Auschwitz
It's just a museum with the prison-like layout
Rest of highlights are awesome but one of their most famous one got me disappointed
I loved bath as a town when I visited but I also love London <3
I feel like you haven't been to the UK until you've been anywhere besides London
I live in Santorini, and even though I am tired of the whole show, there truly isn't any other landscape like it, especially in Greece
It's worth it for the landscape and for other specific things, but the infrastructure and amount of people is a pain in the ass
I really preferred London over Bristol, bath on the other hand is incredible
That same view can be seen from many other islands that won't charge you an arm and a leg
I get that but mainland Greece has many worth going places like Meteora (big and high rocks with monasteries on top them, with breathtaking views)
I'm not saying that people should stop going there but Santorini foreshadows other must - go places in Greece
Meteora in Thessaly
Yeah Rhodes is a great and a lot cheaper than Santorini or Mykonos
How would you call it
True, it does foreshadow them, but at the same time it is not overrated (if that makes sense haha
Okay that's sounds right
Sorry, my bad
Waiting for the rival country to answer my comment
Honestly Greece has no better rival than Greece itself
All of our neighbors
Fucking Greeks ruined Greece
Welcome kardeş
All our neighbors but Bulgaria
Nah I don't think we ever see you as rivals, I actually really admire Iran and the Persian culture
More like disabled and "independent" little brother
The whole Balkan polygon i d say
I would say Albania is not a rival as well
I actually like Macedonians, I lived overseas for many years and I find that you have a very similar culture and sense of humour
We don't recognize it either brate
contentious as in "argumentative" or "controversial"?
love u 2 fam <3
Indeed brat
It's true though, glad you got a laugh lol
Fuck, the reference went over my head
I don't think we really dislike people, at least not for balkan standards
We have some problems with neighbours that are pretty much justified (Turkey being an eternal bully, North Macedonia plagiarising an important part of greek history etc
) but that's it
Indeed
Anywhere full of tourists and business focused only to tourists
London and Paris
I've been in both and honestly, they're overhyped
Only special thing about Paris was Disneyland
There are much more beautiful and more traditional places to see in Europe in terms of history, museums and architecture
I am half Hungarian half Greek
"Nem" is hungarian for "no" and "ne"/"ναι" means "yes" in Greek
Since we speak both in family they get mixed up
Also my Hungarian uncle's name is Kolos which means "ass" in Greek
Empathy in english means to understand and share the feelings of another person
Εμπάθεια (em-pà-thee-a) in greek means seething hate
I first learned the word in english, and it was a fun day at school when I found out the greek definition
The infamous word malaka
It can either mean asshole or a variation of cheese
I'd like to go to Spain
I love the culture and it is a very beautiful country in general
The ~~pen~~ultimate dream would be a villa in the tuscan countryside with a vineyard, horses and a massive library
Oh, and an Internet connection as well
In a more serious (or reasonable, perhaps more realistic, may I say) note, I would very much love to live in a nice, cosy apartment in Florence or Rome
They are living, breathing museums, I would be awestruck everyday
There is a sense of continuity with the past which I love and makes me feel so relaxed
I can't stand the [concrete hell] that is Athens
There is a small secret, Athens is a city that hates its history
Sure, there are ruins from Antiquity that we want to showcase to the happy-go-lucky tourists, but after that, only breadcrumbs
There are almost no traces of the 2000 years that have passed since then
It is literally just a monstrous collection of modern ugly buildings that have been built next to the remnants of the ancient city and span between the four mountains
This, along with some pretty bad personal stuff that I have associated with the city, make me want to escape from here
Maybe one day
Edit: the penultimate is the one in the second paragraph
I started to write abouth that and then my mind for some reason wandered off
Ι don't really like living here
One reason is that I despise the local climate with all my heart
The other reasons are
self explanatory
I like Greece
Maybe I'll move if I decide to do master's or a PhD in an other european country but (unless I meet someone or something like that) I don't think I'll stay abroad longer than I have to
I'm not idolizing it, I am well aware that it is a modern city with modern problems and not a picturesque land out of a carte postale
Despite that, you can't deny that it's an explosion of art and history
You guys do a much better job than us at preserving your past and incorporating it into the present
Even if I won't ever live in Italy, I still want to find time and money in order to spend a couple of months travelling from Aosta Valley and Piedmont all the way down to Calabria, Apulia and Sicily
Visit Sardinia too
-Knock knock
-Who is it
-Probably the majority of your neighbors
-And what do they want
-They want to fucking rape you
^ Pretty much our history until let's say the middle-end of the 20th century and onwards
Sometimes they succeeded and sometimes they didn't.
Strategically I guess we are quite important but also I love the culture that evolved because of the nice warm weather
Finally let me say that I'm a huge sea-lover and I adore the beach so I can't deny that I love our place on earth
I absolutely love it but since even centuries before the birth of Christ everyone has been wanting in on it
Greeks can relate to what you said
Greece and Portugal are on edge of continent
I mean for good scenery and places to go to for vacation Greece is great, but it being mountainous as shit is terrible for the economy
Thats so weird for me
Ive always been like a 10 min walk from the sea
Cant imagine my country without it
We moved to Greece from Russia because we identify as Greeks by ethnicity and after the USSR collapsed most of our relatives moved to Greece, so after some years my family did as well for a better future
Unfortunately, now both countries suffer from corruption, so both of them are not great for a stable living
I feel like both of countries are my home
I know that I am greek by ethnicity and nationality, and russian by nationality
I love both countries but I am planning to move to Netherlands or Sweden due to better education and job opportunities
I left Greece in 2007 for University, totally thought I'd return after my studies but it turns out there are no jobs for me to return to
It sucks, I love the place, but I don't have the tolerance to work multiple low-paying unstable jobs at a time for years before finding something that pays me a living wage as a young person
Πάω στον θρόνο (I'm going to the throne)
Πάω για ξεφόρτωμα (I'll go unload)
I'm not sure I've heard any common ones, but I know that some people I know say this when they have to go to the bathroom
"Πάω να δημιουργήσω" (Pao na dimiourgiso)
Which means roughly "I'm going to create"
Πάω να στείλω ένα φαξ (pao na stealo ena fax) = Going to send a fax
Though, I don't know if this is standard or just an inside joke of my company of friends
There are a lot of expressions about shiting yourself in fear like "I'm shiting out potatoes" or "I'm shiting out soap bars"
There are also many expressions for diarrhoea like "I'm spilling juice" or "I'm spraying"
This is exactly what I was about to mention
It's by far my favorite euphemism
And yes, first time I heard it, I also took it literally
And yes, I did ask "Oh
I didn't know you had kids, how old are they
Cue stoner cackle (it was that kind of night)
We have "πάω στον πρόεδρο" in Greek, meaning 'I'm going to the president'.
Yes pretty common in Greece from the mid 70s onwards (before that we had a US backed military dictatorship in Greece so no soviet imports)
The typical LADA that you showed was always a great cheap car that could survive pretty much anything
The Niva (kinda jeep) is also very common especially for farmers
Not really but to this day you see a lot of old Lada Niva driving around
Yeah I guess because british cars are so much bett
hahaha ok I can't even finish this
Yeah I was about to say it looks a lot like the Niva we have here
One time, my Danish friend tried to cross the street on a pedestrian crossing and a car cut him off, nearly hitting him
He turned at me and said "That's illegal
He is obligated to let me cross the road by law"
Yeah surprise, buddy
Edit: typo
Every person from the Balkans has a similar story
My German friends were crossing not even looking if a car is coming
who even starts clubbing before 2 am
>“PUT ON YOUR FECKING SEAT BELT
Thanks for helping me read that in an Irish accent
>and it's really awkward
I felt that
Sometimes waiters are so underpaid they absolutely need tips
I used to work delivering food and I would be completely broke without tips
I don't think it needs to die, in Greece it's not obligatory tipping, people tip if they feel like it and that imo is a good gesture
The waiters get paid dirt cheap to begging with you might as well tip them a Euro
In my case, is government giving business owners the right to underpay employees by limiting basic salary to the bare minimum and raising taxes to the point certain stuff cost less even in Germany
Tips are considered a form of solidarity to a shitty financial situation
We agree to disagree
It's ok
Aww so romantic
Greece . More than 3500 years of practice :  [Greek fist fighters]
The first image is from an ancient mural 1500 B.C. at Santorini !
The second is a real photo from Greek Football Cup Final 2017 (P.A.O.K vs A.E.K.) - hooligans fight before the match !
(This was a photo-collage that went viral in Greece at 2017
Sometimes I feel i was born in the wrong country
I'm very very very different from the rest of Greeks
Same shit as you
I used to live in London for 6 years but now I came back and I live in an island, in a village
The trick to survival
I write people in my papars and I don't care
I realized after a few years in the UK that quality of life is subjective and happiness cannot be defined, and life in the UK, the culture was very distant to what I like
So, I moved back knowing the diffiulties (especially if you have lived abroad and opened your mind, it can be tricky), but like I said, I don't care what people think or say and I have managed to have a busy but quiet life with good weather and food
Some things are just irreplacable
"I write people in my papars" -> definitely still 100% greek
You could try asking r/Greek or even r/Greece for a good answer
Mostly religious and conservative but there is also a big percentage of more leftist people
Polarization is a big thing
It's not common at all, even among young people, with the exception of parties etc
Even then, the majority isn't drunk and it's considered especially immature for older people
Although we love alcohol, drinking responsibly is propably one of the few things we do right
You can go out on a Saturday night and the only wasted people you'll see are tourists
British tourists to be precise
pretty sure everyone thinks it's fun
young people from 18 to mid-twenties+ get drunk at parties regularly (some people if possible every saturday night)
and actual grown ups get drunk at weddings and such big celebrations
>But when people are falling over, fighting
One of your football players recently got arrested in Greece for drunkenly fighting with a cop
Our news mentioned that he said something about his "golden leg" too so
For most europeans religion is something that comes from tradition and you are not going to switch to a different church because they have a better PR campaign
So churches generally don't advertise
My experience in the US (Texas) was that people were considering different churches because they had better gym membership, daycare, zoos, aquarium, barbecues etc
These thoughts have literally never been associated with church in my country
Personally I am not religious, so I don't go to church, but all the people I know just go to the church in their neighborhood which is of the same denomination as their ancestors had (mostly orthodox in Greece, but few catholics exist as well)
Hellas- Have never seen one and am very surprised that such things exist
Never seen any of those, they look weird and funny lol
> different churches because they had better gym membership, daycare, zoos, aquarium, barbecues etc
Τι πράγμα;
Φαση αυτη η εκκλησια εχει μεσα γυμναστηριο και παιδικη χαρα, η αλλη εχει γηπεδα μπασκετ, η αλλη εχει ζωολογικο κηπο κ πανε εκδρομες, η αλλη εχει προγραμματα για εφηβους με ομαδες κλπ. Μεχρι μου ελεγε ο φιλος εκει πολλες εχουνε και fund για να δωσουν λεφτα αμα παθεις κατι κ χρειαζεσαι γιατρο (αφου αμερικα δεν εχει ασφαλιση)
Οταν γινεσαι μελος κανεις δηλωση ποσα βγαζεις κ σου βαζουνε μια μηνιαια συνδρομη ταριφα για τα εξοδα της εκκλησιας. Τα κτηρια τους μοιαζουνε σαν mall παρομοια με ΙΚΕΑ κλπ.
Απο αποψη του τι διδασκουνε, ειναι ολοι διαφορες παραλλαγες του προτεσταντισμού αλλά η καθεμια εχει τα δικά της χαρακτηριστικα. Ο φιλος εκει πχ ειναι μουσουλμανος αλλα μου ελεγε σκεφτεται να γραφτει σε μια εκκλησια γιατι εχει καλο γυμναστηριο και γηπεδα τενις κοντα του. Γενικα πολλη απο την υποδομη του κρατους την κανουνε οι εκκλησιες (αφου το κρατος ειδικα στο τεξας ειναι ανυπαρκτο)
Τι στον πουτσο ρε μλκ, ακούγεται σαν cult
μπιζνα ειναι τι ψάχνεις. Οι δικοι μας οι παπάδες ειναι δημοσιοι υπάλληλοι, εκει εχουνε ελευθερη αγορά και ο πιστος-καταναλωτής διαλέγει... οποτε παιζει πολυ το μαρκετινγκ και το τι προσφερει ο καθενας...
There are none - we don't share the same alphabet, let alone roots
Cypriots can understand Greek, and Greeks most of the time understand Cypriots unless they are using a heavy Cypriot Greek dialect with a lot of words that are not as common in the Greek mainland
I had friends in college from Cyprus that I could understand, but when I heard Cypriots speaking their dialect between them it was sometimes hard to follow
None except if you count Byzantine/medieval greek and ancient Greek as separate languages, then yes (In personally don't think of them as separate)
It's a pity dialects dont pass as languages, like Grico, Cretan, Cypriot, Pontic etc
Are you referring to Tsakonian
Hahaha true, [but yeah but no but yah
You're right it's so sad the language doesn't get enough recognition lately despite having survived that long
Alcohol, grilling meat, the family table, the shouting, name days, feta, olives and oil, fairs, calling each other Malaka, desire to reclaim Constantinupole
i would really love to have a sauna in my home, it's so relaxing, but sadly they are kinda rare here
Same in Greece I guess it's a Mediterranean thing lol
**Souvlaki** is the greek god you were never taught about in Mythology class
It's not that uncommon to display one outside your house (or on your balcony), or maybe keep one in storage for occasional use (sports events/ national holidays)
In my opinion a flag itselve is not a tell of whether or not someone is someone is a nationalist or not, there are other way more important signs that that
It's kinda odd unless it's a National Holiday ( 28 October, 25 March ) , but even then, it's not that common
People who do display the flag constantly are more often than not pretty right-wing
Also, there's usually no flags displayed inside gyms, schools/universities, restaurants etc
I dont think that's the case here
They have it because they share the same language with Greece, the culture, the religion, the customs and much more
(They wouldn't want to enosis with Greece because of the Greek debt situation, moreover their constitution, doesn't allow enosis with no country)
A good recent photo is [this one] of a Greek soldier in the Greco-Italian war (ww2) smiling, really showing how the Greeks felt about the war
But the one every single Greek absolutely knows is [this one] from the third siege of Messologhi from the revolution of 1821
I've always wondered the story behind this photograph
Who was the girl
Was it staged
Lmao you're right he was asking for *photographs* I just couldn't think of anything else that every Greek would know
I personally hate the final exams of high school
You have to study 24/7 (I am not kidding) for you to get a 12/20 grade
My cousin's hair fall down constantly because of the pressure and she can't even have fun (she gets 15 minutes out of 24 hours to relax)
Meanwhile, our government passed a law which says both (paid) colleges and public (free) universities are equal now
Let me clarify that he children in colleges don't get to go through this (€€€€€)
Greece is the only country who invests the least GDP compared to all european countries
You also have to pay for frontistririo which is a second school, so you get to study double the amount cause our educational system is lame
That's why we are not educated properly, we are some of the worst drivers ever and we are generally a corrupt community
Sorry for the rant but I had to let it out
Edit from comment: Now I get it
I was confused about private schools and colleges
Excuse me for my wrongdoing, I meant that children can get in a college without the exams, by paying, while us in public/private schools have to give them
Everyone thinks they know everything better than anyone else, the sense of entitlement and disrespect for the rest and the quality of urban infrastructure and life (no green spaces, bad or non-existent pavements, cars parked on literally everything, extremely poorly designed road network and increasingly old buildings)
Also a manic clenching to the past while not actually following the ancients' examples
Guys with €€€ have been already sending their children to private universities for decades now, just in other countries
It's free GDP that Greece has been losing because of our stubborness against private universities
Also, try finding a European country in which private universities are not officially recognized
You won't find any
That said, I totally feel your pain, I passed through the same shit myself with the national exams
It's just a matter of economics
If something is sought after so much (eg Medicine) it will be hard getting in
Stop spreading misinformation
Students of private schools take the Panhellenic exams and the final exams every year for six years
They will never know how earning your money with modern skills feels like, and be able to go above the back-breaking labour that uneducated illegal immigrants can do for half the price
I felt that
Ok I may have said it in a wrong way but you get my point, it is still unfair
Edit: I am not actually saying those at private schools don't have to pass the exams, what I was referring to is that these kids don't have to worry the same and they have a lot more ease getting to a university
Edit 2: Now I get it
I was confused about private schools and colleges
Excuse me for my wrongdoing, I meant that children can get in a college without the exams, by paying, while us in public/private schools have to give them
Europe was not at war with itself
It was not a civil war
Europe consists of many different countries and cultures that have been in war far longer that they have been in peace
And still a lot of Euro countries have disagreements and conflicts that thankfully don't devolve into war
European consolidation and unity are relevantly recent ideas
> and we have the biggest military surplus company in Europe
Varusteleka
This is a weird fact
It's not uncommon to use fingers as a measure of length, usually in the hairdressers
It's not exactly traditional, but it doesn't adhere to some specific measuring system
It is, like the name suggests, the thickness of a finger and it usually equals half an inch, or one and a half centimeters
Came here to say okka(=1
3kg) and drami (=3
2gr)
Drami is still somewhat used traditionally in bottles of ouzo, tsipouro and raki
It is not unusual for example to still ask for a "*κατοσταράκι"* (katostaraki), which is a bottle of 100 dramia, or 320gr
That's a pretty big assumption
Let's say you have [this stud] in front of you for example
The dick has a mind of its own
I used to hate [rebetiko] which is a Greek traditional genre of music
When I was younger, I always felt it was too "heavy" for me, probably because most of the songs are about drugs and poverty
Now I love it
I think it describes exceptionally what it is to be forced into crime in order to survive
It is an essential part of the modem Greek spirit
Fucking hell with the soup
Every
Single
Meal
I'm tired of eating it hahah
Both pronunciations are used, the latter more common amongst older generations
Maybe, I hear both much
Starting from our ancient history, I'd say its something like:
Persia (Iran)
Egypt
Italy
Ottoman Empire (Turkey)
Western Roman Empire (Western European countries)
In our modern history though:
Turkey
Germany
Italy
Russia
Cyprus
Bulgaria is an option, too
Turkey, 2
Egypt, 3
Italy, 4
Cyprus, 5
Bulgaria
1 Turkey
2 Italy
3 Iran
4 Bulgaria
5 Egypt
Honorable mentions: France, Russia, UK and Lebanon (Phoenicians), Armenia, Syria also
Turkey (Ottoman Period), Italy (Roman Empire mostly), Bulgaria (since they interacted a lot with the Byzantine Empire), Iran (ancient Persia) and the 5th would probably be Egypt (ancient Egypt and Ptolemaic Egypt)
I'd swap out Russia for Bulgaria
Surprised with putting us so low
I had better expectations from our relationship
It's 50/50
Russia played a critical role during and after the Revolution
Surely it's a large chapter in our history but I couldn't recall any related information so I chose to exclude it
I had it in mind but I'm not really sure which modern country they represent
If you want my opinion I'd say they were Greeks but many will have objections about it
I'm curious about your username
That could be enough of a pain in the arse for games to remove gambling mechanics and heavily monetize other aspects
because the rest of the world is becoming big, federalization is the only way to go
If people move to rural areas, then rural areas will become cities
But is it really 51 years worth of progress
Wright brothers to moon landing felt much more grand
I'll have to go with Cyprus
Although southern Italy is pretty much the same as us except for the language
I suppose Cyprus
We speak the same language, many people go over there to study, and you can even choose to join that army instead of the Greek one
After that, probably Italy, we have very similar cultures, share history, same weather
Greece & Cyprus for sure
But we also consider Serbians our brothers :)
i'd say Cyprus, we speak the same language but they have a funny accent
and most of the time Cyprus seems like an extension of Greece
Well I would say Italy and maybe Spain
Maaaayyyyyyyybeeeeeeee Turkey as well, sure we are both against each other but we also help each other some times
altho this depends on the person
Cyprus obviously, but it feels weird to even call it a brother country, many here in Greece think of Cyprus and Greece as being one in the same
I'd say the same kardesim
I've lived all around the Balkans, and spent some time in western Turkey, and all I see is the same traditions, behaviors, insecurities
I think we should all just grow up and realize just how similar we all are, and make our own union (let's call it the Eastern Union, EU haha), with blackjack hookers and raki
\*Cries in Greek\*
Hug me brotha
Why don't you play with the nighbour's kid
The neighbour's kid: America
To my knowledge it's originaly a South Italian saying and not a Greek one, if that answers your question
Yeah, it's quite embarrassing tbh, you have a total shit song not even you would vote for and you still get the maximum points just because you're related
Well, many others did the exact same and it was the main reason I stopped watching it, it had become politics instead of a song contest
It's ok we can be friends in secret
Lots of my friends are from Albania, I even visited once
\*sad coffee sip\*
Aren't we worthy of the qifsha ropt award 2020
> Lolllll I was going to say Greece but I felt like I was going to be attacked by nationalists
I think I haven't seen anyone act hostile to Albanians for years and that makes me quite happy
We love y'all and you know it <3
Tell it to other Greek guy on this thread fratello, who doesn't belive me hahaha
Yeah, the venetians suck big time :p
If Greeks were more hostile towards Venetians it would probably be more for the Sack fo Constantinople in 1204, which was instigated by the Doge himself, and had insane effects in the next centuries,  than the Parthenon, which was horrible, but was one General doing his general things and except from the monumental loss, it didn't effect Greeks that much
But Greeks arent, Venice as a seperate entity havent been relevant for centuries in Greece, plus the areas occupied by them, or Italy after the unification had it way better than the places the Ottomans had
Well it's actually written as "una faccia una razza" and no Greek would write it that way
But despite its origins I can assure you from my own experience that Italians use it too and very often when interfering with Greeks ;)
I was joking about the Venice part, all Italians are the same to us and there are no grudges
We most definitely prefer Italian tourists to any other, cause you're exactly as loud as we are when having conversations therefore no one gets annoyed
OK, you're a little louder then us I have to admit
Correct
It's αδερφή (sister) and αδερφός (brother) even today, not just in old Greek ;)
Scusi sorella
(I hope I wrote it correctly)
Well I'm telling you my first hand experience, which btw was in Italy and not Greece and you still won't believe me, and not only that but you found an excuse for me hearing it, that it's apparently a tourism industry trick
As if I'm somehow retarded
I mean wtf
I hate to disappoint you but the loudest man-made noise I've ever witnessed was when a school from Italy came through a ferry ship  terminal in Greece,  don't ask me where they were from in Italy cause it was to loud to ask but definitely not southerners cause they were waiting for the ferry to Ancona
Even Greeks got annoyed, imagine that ;p
>I hope with the other greek guy in the other comment you didn’t say i was annoying because i pointed out i’m not a guy (i don’t speak greek)
What
No, nothing like that
I don't know where you're from in Greece but I'm from the Ionian coast, we see more Italians then Greeks here
It's like e.g. you living in Portland and telling me something about Seattle and I (who btw live on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean) won't believe you cause I would prefer to hear it from someone that lives in Washington State
It's not something important, like nuclear launch codes, just an expression people in Seattle use
Now, why the fck would I lie about somethig like that
Well, In Greece there's loud and quite ones everywhere, we're not bound by coordinates on a map ;p
Well I don't know where you lived in Italy but if it was north of Napoli you propably wouldn't have heard it, also for starters people need to know that you're Greek to say it
I've visited plenty of times, Campania, Apulia and southwards and heard it every time, never heard it in Venice, Florence and Milan though
>PS: for our fellow Europeans: We aren't fighting here, we are just solving an argument in the Greek way
Can confirm
Now that's very un-Greek of you, I'm offended
Lmao
OK, that's a good reason
No soy hispanohablante nativo pero he aprendido español
Cuando estaba en Brasil podía entender mucho del portugues escrito, pero no entendía ni papa de las conversaciones
Parecía ruso
Carthago delenda est
We do this too
I'd rather use the old flag, just a white cross on a blue background
White cross over a blue back round and the golden Byzantine eagle that our churches use on top
It'd be lit
I'd take out the cross
It's a leftover religious symbol and I don't like it
I like the colour though
I would find a way to incorporate the old flag (with just the cross) With a doubleheaded eagle or the Vergina Sun
Yellow and black should be on the flag outside of blue and white
I would go back to the pre-1978 flag, which has only a white cross in a light blue backround
i'd make the blue dark af and leave it at that, maybe design a better naval jack or a COA tho
I would go back to the darker version because it looked cooler, not because of the dictatorship
Me too
I love your flag's colors
Best flag imo
Idk considering that religion here is more like history than actual religion and anyways it doesnt stand out as much as the Muslim symbol it is pretty ok
I totally agree, but can't figure out what to put in its place
How do you make this
We have built the society around religion
Churches don't pay taxes, children are indoctrinated in the religion and the church has a say in so many aspects of everyday life that I refuse to see it as a harmless symbol
It stands to remind everyone that Greece is orthodoxy and orthodoxy is Greece
Also it's a very boring symbol
At least the crescent moon and star are nice shapes
A souvlaki
Christianity, whether you believe in it or not, is the reason Greece is free today
If the revolutionaries in 1821 didn't rally behind God, freeing this country would not have worked
As Theodoros Koloktronis said "We fight firstly for our God and then for our land" which is why the Cross has been on every Greek flag since that time
The meaning is more historic than religious
I would never remove it
Yes indeed many of these are true but I dont think it reminds anyone that Greece is orthodoxy Switzerland has also a cross on the flag and I never even gave attention to it
I personally think it blends in very well in a design with lines and generally it remains discrete and nice
This is clearly not what I meant lol
Σωστοοος.... μια τριήρης
I mean, it's just an opinion so I wouldn't expect us to be 100% in agreement
I can't answer on the Switzerland part as I have no view on how it affects Swiss people and how they feel about it
That's just how I've always felt about our flag
We Greeks tend to live with our parents up until the day we move out to live with our SO (that's not the case for all Greeks, of course, but it's pretty common)
Most of us don't even contribute a penny while staying with them, unless they deal with financial problems (rarely a Greek parent would ask from his/her kid to chip in even if they dealt with financial problems)
I'm not talking about the last 10 years which have been harsh on our economy; it was a well established practice even before that
First time I heard (many years ago) that this wasn't the case in other countries, I thought that the whole world was weird
If you ask me now, in my forties, I think that we are the weird ones (and every other nation that does the same)
Sure, you always have a safety net, but then it's exactly that, you have a safety net that becomes your comfort zone from which you never wish to step out
It's debilitating
To answer your question, no, it's not normal in Greece
Normally, it isn't even expected of you to contribute to the expenses (food, bills)
That's a joke we Southerners like to do for Germans and other western countries
Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus are countries family centered
Though unemployment plays a huge role in all that
It's very difficult to run a house by yourself though if the kids are working they contribute to the family's budget
I would say the opposite happens, meaning parents trying to keep their kids at home for as long as they can
Some islands have mascot animals, e.g. Mykonos IIRC traditionally has pelicans - the original was called Peter
There was also a monk seal mascot for Samos, but that poor thing was killed
Two flipping wolves and people start panicking, sad indeed,
they say it sounds like Spanish and that it is very hard
Some people say it sounds Portuguese and I thank them
Someone said my Greek accent sounds Arabic and I haven't spoken to him since
It is like a hard version of Dutch and an ugly version of Norwegian
I fucking love Danish, it definitely does sound smooth and melodic to me as well
I usually get it though
It may help that I have a half Cypriot half Greek friend
That's me but with Cypriots
tbh I could probably imitate a perfect Spanish accent by only slightly modifying my Greek accent
Yeah that's what I'm saying, Cypriots can perfectly understand "clean" Greek but the average Greek can't understand Cypriot Greek
It's most probably what you said, Cypriots are exposed to Greek media whereas all that Greeks have from Cyprus is a well known youtuber who just speaks standard Greek with an accent lol
Thank you Finland for the great music
I want to thank Turkey for sending millions of refugees to Greece crippling our already bad economy even more, and calling us the bad guys when we deny passage to the refugees
Thanks Erdogan
Don't forget the friendly game between AEK athens "against" Partizan to send a message to the world when the bombings from NATO took place in your country when everyone else was afraid to even talk about it and even more to go to your country
Always love for our orthodox brothers
No not really, we only lock if we'll be gone for a N extended period of time, more than a day
I have friends though that do that but it's considered a bit too much from my experience
I usually don't, it's not like it opens from the outside anyways
I always lock it at night though, and the door of the building gets locked after 11pm too
Τζον μέιντ χιζ γουέι του ε τάβερν θρου δε νταρκ φόρεστ, όνλι του φάιντ άουτ δατ χι φοργκότ δε μάνι.
It's rough though cause Greek has 5 vowels and English has like 89
Modern Greek script:
Τζων μεϊντ χιζ γουέυ του ε τάβερν θρου δε ντάρκ φόρεστ, όουνλυ του φαϊντ άουτ δατ χη φοργκότ δε μάνυ
greek: Τζον μέιντ χιζ ουέι του ε τάβερν θρου δε νταρκ φόρεστ, όνλυ του φάινντ άουτ δατ χι φοργκότ δε μάνυ
In Greek it would look like this:
Τζον μεϊντ χις ουεϊ του εϊ ταβερν θρου δε νταρκ φορεστ, ονλη του φαϊνντ αουτ δατ χη φοργκοτ χεις μονυ.
it would probably go like "Τζόν μέιντ χις γουέι το ε τάβερν θρο δε ντάρκ φόρεστ, όνλι του φάιντ άουτ δατ χι φοργκότ δε μάνι"
A roughly translation is the following :
Ο Γιάννης, περνώντας μέσα από το σκοτεινό δάσος, πηγαίνοντας στην ταβέρνα, ανακάλυψε ότι ξέχασε τα χρήματα.
Obviously Covid is widely discussed, since we're also heading for the second wave, and new measures have recently been enforced
Other than that, we also have:
* The aftermath of the [Golden Dawn trial] (officially recognised far-right criminal organisation that used to function as a political party)
The final sentencing of the members and their arrests
The fact that their second in command (Christos Pappas) managed to escape police custody and still hasn't been caught, despite the fact that everyone was [assudered] such thing could never happen
* Our [maritime border with Turkey] I won't get too much into that because I've missed some of the newer updates, but it's a topic that I constantly see trending
Turkish aggression
Covid Pandemic
The new legislation revising the bankruptcy code
The Golden Dawn trial is still being talked about a lot
I think these issues currently ranking at the top at that order too
Last year it was the exact opposite
October came and it was still summer
> since we're also heading for the second wave
I'm no epidemiologist but hasn't the second wave already hit us in the face with a hammer with thorns
That's what I'd think too, but everyone on the news keeps talking about how we're "close" to the second wave, what can I say
Damn that's kinda sad tbh, hope that in some way you find a way to improve your mood and find time to enjoy the things you ~~lowe~~ love
EDIT: autocorrect
Hope your life improves
Oh how magnanimous, ~~defending~~  wishing well to people while undermining their ~~age~~ nationality
I don't know why are you so hostile man, I really hope your life improves
Thanks but we are good, the fine people in Germany have used your loans to them to loan us good
We aren't giving them back though, so good luck to your boys getting them from them I guess
Since you specified law schools , it's the Nation and Kapodistrian University of Athens' School of Law ,for 2020 it was among the 300 best law schools internationally
[Also a team of students managed to win even against Harvard in 2015]
If you want technical universities, the best is National Technical School of Athens,their Civil Engineering school is 11th in Europe, their other schools are very good,too
I'd say university of Crete has some of the best departments
If you ask humble people who know their stuff they'll tell you so
If you ask faculty members they will scoff and pretend that other universities other than theirs don't exist
Albania, Serbia, BiH & Montenegro
Generally i never really cared for those countries
I spent a day in Bratislava back in 2015, I absolutely loved it
Our stay there was part of a school trip that saw us visiting Austria, then Hungary, then Slovakia, in order to catch a cheaper flight from there back to Athens
To me, the fact that it seemed rather neat and contained was a breath of fresh air, honestly
A few interesting buildings here and there, quiet streets you could get lost in, everything I could ever ask for
Also had some great food in the city square (or whatever the restaurant was)
I felt that the service was the warmest we had received throughout the entire trip too, everyone was just so nice
It's a great alternative to more tourist-trap-y destinations in the neighborhood, since you can see similar sites and architecture (even at a smaller scale), while also enjoying a more relaxed holiday
In short, a perfect destination for travelers like me, who prefer more off the grid stuff
I used to say back then, that among the three countries we'd visited, I'd work in Austria, retire in Slovakia, then travel to Hungary for the holidays
Jesus Christ, we went on exactly the same trip in 12th grade and I’d say that Slovakia was absolutely the highlight
"Empathy" (ἐμπάθεια) in Greek means hostility, and is a pseudo-cognate word as it means roughly the opposite in each language
>since feces are the most disgusting thing in the world
Hey man not cool
Everyone likes what they like what is your problem
I remember a British aquaintance had to explain to me that when he said "this is very interesting" he meant exactly the opposite
Apparently he realized I kept misunderstanding him
Modern Greece was born in corruption
The rest of you merely adopted it
Let's just say you can rate your country in a scale of 1 to mine
As a Greek I feel I am very close to the top
Salutes to our Romanian, Serbian, Albanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian and Serbian brothers, btw, Balkans rule in this thread
I can’t really pick but in my opinion it is one of those:
[Όταν έρχονται τα σύννεφα by Manos Chatzidakis]
[Ένα το Χελιδόνι by Mikis Theodorakis]
[Το Ζεϊμπέκικο της Ευδοκίας by Manos Loizos]
This is about preference so it's purely subjective
Maybe it's a cliché but for a reason [Sirtaki - Mikis Theodorakis]
Hans Zimmer is amazing
Thank you my friend, hope for peace
Well, i can’t say I agree with you but it’s indeed a good song
Life is fine, I have everything near me, city is ugly af
I come from kalamata but live in Athens
I get shivers when I have to visit a friend if there are buses involved
The suburbs are nice though, basically me and everyone I know try to avoid the center and live/hang out only in Glyfada, voula vouliagmeni, kifissia etc
Athens right
Ugliest city I've ever been so far
Suburbs are lit
Center and big municipalities are shit
Our cities are not ugly, Athens is
Just look it up on r/urbanhell
Athens
Thessaloniki is nice from what I've heard
Lol, hi Maria, Elena, Kosta and Giorgo
Born and raised in a very busy municipality and having been across Athens and it's suburbs, I can say that the city itself, especially the center is tragic for the prestige it's associated with
The suburbs are nice though
Athens-Thessaloniki rivalry is a classic
Dad with a couple of Athenian friends had their car windows smashed at some point in the 80s I believe during a trip there
But things are chill now and it's mostly calling each other idiots for "misnaming" things
Hey, as long as they also have a plan to stop equipment looting, I'm all for it
usually its the province of atlantis but the joke went too far ...
> Atlantic
the name comes from ATLAS a titan in greek mythology
this site  is one of the hypothetical locations of atlantis

The whole souvlaki/gyro naming dispute
In athens, where I'm from, we call the pita-wrap-dish souvlaki and the meat-on-a-stick-dish we call kalamaki (which literally means straw)
I am not sure about the south of Greece, but I know that in the North they call the wrap a "pitogyro" and the meat stick a "souvlaki", so it is a very big debate between regions of Greece whether if the pita wrap thing is called a "souvlaki" or a "pitogyro" and if the meat stick thing is called a "souvlaki" or "kalamaki". So basically here in Athens at least, when we say souvlaki we mean the wrap, and in the north of Greece when they say souvlaki they mean the stick, and the term "kalamaki" for the stick does not exist there either
&#x200B;
I want to order a souvlaki now
(the wrap kind :\] )
You could also add people from Thessaloniki calling all "pita" as "bugatsa".
Have you checked its underside
Or all yellow cheeses "kaséri"
I'm not sure I completely understand your question, but in Greek the singular form is Gyros/Gyro, our plural is not like in English, so we don't put an "s" to make things plural
In Greek there are different forms of the singular of a word actually, and I'm not a linguistics expert so I don't really know how to explain it well,
If you want to say, "I want a gyro" you would say "Θέλω έναν γύρο" (Thelo enan gyro) without an "s",
But if you want to say "My favourite food is gyro" you would say "Το αγαπημένο μου φαγητό είναι ο γύρος" (my favourite food is gyros) with an "s".
This is similar to names in Greek, in English it's always "Sokrates" and "Platonas" for example, but in Greek if you are speaking directly to someone, you would say "Hey Sokrati/Platona" with no s, but if you were speaking about them in the third person, you would say "Ο Σωκράτης/Πλάτωνας είναι μαλάκας" (Sokratis/Platonas is an asshole) with an s, idk why this example with asshole came to my mind, but whatever hahaha
I hope this makes some sense(?)
Hmmm
I'd say you need to learn a foreign language because if you don't you are pretty much stuck at home
Also us smaller countries don't have the same air and sound pollution compared to other bigger cities
Hippopotamus=Ιπποπόταμος (Hippopótamos) River horse
Giraffe=Καμηλοπάρδαλη (Kamilopárdali) spotted camel
Leopard=Λεοπάρδαλη (leopárdali) spotted lion
Mole=τυφλοπόντικας(tyflopóntikas) blind mouse
Those are of the top of my head
And a cool one to balance it:
Bat=Νυχτερίδα (Nychterída) daughter of the night I think
(Edit:added more)
I don't think Νυχτεριδα means that, it may come from Νυξ the goddess of the night (daughter of Chaos), but that is a long path to Νυχτεριδα with many other meanings in between
&#x200B;
Do you have any source
but anteater = μυρμηγκοφάγος (anteater) :D
Some more:
&#x200B;
hedgehog (σκαντζόχοιρος) = thorned pig
guinea fowl (φραγκόκοτα) = Franks' chicken
weasel (νυφίτσα) = little Nymph
mussel (μύδι) = little mouse
squid (καλαμάρι) = inkwell
octopus (χταπόδι) = eight-foot
centipede (σαρανταποδαρούσα) = forty-feeted
rose chaffer (χρυσόμυγα) = goldfly
earwig (ψαλίδα) = clippers
mantis (αλογάκι της Παναγίας) = Virgin Mary's horse
PS: Not stupid names, just literal
No that's why I said" I think", I know that the suffix -Ίδα/-ιδας means son/daughter of (hence leonidas means Lion's son) so I figured that's what it meant but I'm in no way sure of it, I tried to google it but nothing helpful came up
>Hippopotamus
It also literally means river horse (comes from greek)
Sin Boy - Mama
Hawk - Caliente
And now Konstantinos Argyros - Athina mou
[This] came to mind
I think you won't get unanimous answers
Really
Ok, look for Μαρίνα Σάττι - Μάντισσα in yt, maybe you 'll find an alternative videolink you can watch

I have been to Romania and was a passenger in a car travelling cross-country

I still believe
Oh yes the ID card issue is huge
I feel ashamed every time I go abroad and they see my ID card at an airport
Almost everyone laughs
Story in English
The Greek way
That's why you pay ~€86 for the privilege of having a passport for 5 years, and a document that isn't a complete mess
But then the cover is only in Greek
Last I checked, Ελληνική Δημοκρατία doesn't look like anything to most people
You just can't win
It has happened to me multiple times, but people never seem to notice the english on the id card
I've been asked if that is the Cyrillic alphabet
I have argued so many times on airports, insisting that there is in fact english on my ID
They never seem to notice
It isn't exactly cheap and definitely not a good investment for people that don't travel that often
[An example]
Which is why I was being sarcastic
It's the only identification document that's more presentable and it costs €86 for an amazing 5 whole years
I just can't fathom the reason for the 5 year period
It's kinda nice not having to pull out the old "flash card laminated in a 20 year old elementary school faculty room laminator" ID card you know
Too bad it's a pretty hefty charge
I just wanted to weed out any possibility of your comment not being sarcastic tbh but yeah, mentioning the cost and duration of the passport is the second reason people laugh about in airports
And no expiry date
Mine was issued in 2008 when I was in my preteens
Guess who gets to know the immigration police officers better every time
Not really
Other than masks, supermarkets are good
In greek it could be Φιλότιμο - filotimo
The Word literally means friend of honor, and is used to descripe that we deeply care about something
Malaka
It is a word describing immense beauty and the freedom of happiness
_Beautiful Greek Words:_
πνεύμα, rough (pronounced:pnévma) which means spirit, soul
αήρ (aír) or in Modern Greek, αέρας (aéras), the air
απόκοσμος (apókosmos), something that doesn't relate or doesn't come from our world, but from another one, smth mysterious, strange or heavenly and wonderful
αλεξιθυμία (alexithimía) this word describes the people that have a difficult time understanding feelings in general and expressing their feelings
κάθαρση (kátharsi), catharsis
σκιαμαχία (skiamahía) fighting an invisible, non-existent enemy, literally: a fight with shadows
μεράκι (meráki) is the very intense/strong love, passion and care about smth, about an activity like work
Example: An entrepreneur is working with much meráki
He works with much passion and is enjoying his job
ευδαιμονία (efdemonía) the continuous psychic relaxation
νόστος (nóstos) to express our return home after a long absent from our homeland
νοσταλγία (nostalgía) from the word νόστος + άλγος (álgos) = pain
It is borrowed into English from Greek as nostalgia
δέος (déos) is  excitement, followed by feelings of fear or worry for something that exceeds our strength
φωτοσβέστης (photosvéstis), the "enemy" of progress and learning, the obscurantist
μέντωρ or μέντωρας  (méntor(as)) or in English, the mentor
θάλασσα (sea - thalassa) or σύννεφο (cloud -sinnefo)
Maybe not with a deep meaning, but I love the way they sound
+1 το έψαχνα
Sike
It means wanker
Yeah that's correct
Happy to help if it's all Greek to you and you need clarifications or explanations
By the way,  the correct way of saying it as an abjective is:
filotimos masculine singular
filotimi masculine plural
filotimi feminine singular
filotimes feminine plural
filotimo neutral singular
filotima neutral plural
And then we have, filotimo as a noun
I don't know if you really care about it, but whatever
I mean, technically, no doubt, it translates to wanker
But much to my surprise as well, the comment is not entiiirely wrong (???)
Like, when you're in complete awe or when you're finally free of a huge burden or when you have this small moment of appreciation and happiness, just taking a breath and letting it out with a "malaaaka" feels quite cathartic
Everyday malakía
Wait, they're called Bergsmannsheil instead of Krakenhaus
Yup exactly
Thinking about it briefly, it can apply to most situations where fuck is used as an exclamation, plus if you wanna say to sb "cut it out/stop nagging me", or as a disapproving "are you serious
" or if there is sth really wholesome going on (of course in an extremely informal environment)
And it's most definitely known as the insult, it's on the same level as "asshole" I'd say, but it's also commonly used in as "dude/bro" between friends
Not particularly ugly but there's a girl in my class named Νεονίλλη (Neonilli)
I haven't heard a name like this before
Also: Αλέκος (Alekos), it's supposed to be a derivative of Alexander but to me it sounds like the Greek equivalent of a redneck
I've seen other people say this but any American-ish names i sort of dislike, they just sound wrong for a Greek person
I dislike most ancient Greek names, some are ok like Aristoteles or Alexandros but there are some really weird ones that just don't fit in with modern Greek
male: Χρυσοβαλάντης (Chrysovalántis)
female: Αφροξυλάνθη (Afroxylánthi)
Both sound way worse if you're greek
I believe the worst native name from my country is probably "  Σεραφείμ "
German names are so cool though
Νεονίλλη?!?!?!?!?!? Weird name
I think Afroxylánthi doesnt exist it was made up as a really ugly and weird name
Just googled it found nothing about it being real or not
Arsenios, Chrysanthos, Kleopatra, Demosthenes, Eugenios, Ektoras, Ermes, Hieronymos, Isidora, Iasonas, Kassandra, Nestoras, Prometheas, Solon, Xanthippe, Socrates
Almost all modern Greek names have some roots in ancient Greek, but most weren't used that much unlike these names
A simple google search for "Afroksylanthi" turned up a couple facebook profiles of people named Afroxylanthi, a Wiktionary article about the name and a slang
gr article about the idiomatic uses the absurdity of that name has produced
the facebook profiles seem to be ironic, the [slang
gr] article contains this " Υποθέτω πως είναι η κόρη της [κυρα-περμαθούλας] και ανηψιά της [θεία-Φωτούλας]  που την έχουν κλείσει στον μικρόκοσμο κάποιου νησιού ή χωριού να έχει  άσπρη αφράτη επιδερμίδα, και φροντίζουν αυτές για το συνοικέσιο." and the wiktionary article says almost nothing (I mean if the name was real at least a dictionary would know something more about it)
So almost nothing

Many Greeks have already commented but I just want to add the vending machine and the antikythera mechanism (or any other astronomical automatic mechanism), as well as the first ticking clock and central heating
Also, astrology
Sorry for that
This is a hard question, but probably, the steam engine, democracy, geography, the crane, central heating, showers and underground sewer systems would be some of the top Inventions
Ancient Greece : Democracy and a lot of science-math-literature-art parts
Eastern Roman empire: Hagia Sofia which defined the Orthodox church's architecture, Greek fire which was a type of flamethrower that wasn't extinguished by water and we still don't know how it was made
Modern Greece : the pap test which is the most accurate test for cervical cancer
Worst invention : Pizza with pineapple
maybe democracy or olympic games
maybe gyros with tzatziki
We've made a lot of discoveries and inventions but I I would choose the Olympic Games
Then the stupid Romans came along, and introduced us to women
We're still hanging around tho, much to many people's dismay
Bloody monsters
Only if you have a generous amount of oil in exchange for that F R E E D O M
Ah yes, the beauty of the european borders
Swedes get drunk in Denmark, Bulgarians get drunk in Greece and Brits get drunk everywhere :)
In Greece, we used the term Δωσίλογος (Dosilogos) to describe a traitor during the nazi occupation of the country
&#x200B;
It's a combination of the words δώσω (I will/to give) and λόγος (speech/reason)
It literally means a man who must speak for his actions as in the man who will be held responsible for his actions
&#x200B;
OK, I was born in 1996, so I can't tell you about before but during the financial crisis that we went through the last decade, the term was used broadly against the politicians who supported austerity measures
in Greece it's not very common but when someone rats you out you tell them "the Germans are our friends right
my dad and Grandpa (grandpa fought in the battle of Crete) use the phrase "Οι Γερμανοί ειναι φίλοι μας ε?" (The Germans are our friends right
I think κουκουλοφόρος (koulouloforos, literally meaning "he who wears a hood") is still used as well
The term came to meaning "traitor" during the occupation because collaborators would wear hoods when identifying suspects
It's still used to describe someone who has betrayed you, especially if he did it behind your back
There's also the term «Τσολάκογλου/Tsolakoglou», the surname of the collaborationist PM
It's the equivalent of Quisling, but only meant for high class people (eg the PMs that have signed the bailouts, in recent times)
Quite the offensive word
We also use Germanotsoliades (Γερμανοτσολιάδες) or Tagmatasfalites (Ταγματασφαλίτες) portmanteaus for members of  the ["Security Battalions"] paramilitary counter-guerilla forces the Germans set up with Greek volunteers, and sent them to fight the Communist-led partisans
They committed many atrocities, and unfortunately many were left untouched post war a
or even used by the new western affiliated Greek government ,  which was afraid of a communist take over, and with the tacit support of the British went into a period of White terror that was the final trigger for the Greek civil war
It is similar to how many former Wermacht officers were not touched by the Allies so they could prop up West Germany's armies so it could be a bulwark for East Germany and the Soviets
It is a very dark page in Greek history and it is *very* divisive even today
This phrase is actually a misquote (perhaps the most famous greek misquote) from the movie Η Χαραυγή της Νίκης (Dawn of Victory) of 1971
The actual quote doesn't say "Οι Γερμανοί είναι φίλοι μας" but "Μας αγαπάνε οι Γερμανοί, σαν φίλοι έρχονται" (The Germans love us, they come as friends)
It takes place on a scene when a Greek favored by the Nazis tries to convince the villagers of a Cretan village to give up the resistance members hiding among them
When they refuse the Germans execute them all
My Dad is Cretan so that would explain it
the thought of a person like that makes me want to shoot someone
I feel you
I tried it with German, and people would be anxious to help me and instantly switch to English
I realised I used to do it too, so now I just ask if English would be more convenient
I think you would be quite within your rights to ask if they'd mind using <language> because you'd like to practise
Αλλιώς, υπάρχει και το Reddit
I used to live in the UK for some time and I love British English more than American English
I won't say much on that because it may come out as me hating on Americans which is not my intention
I will however say that I've worked for a few small businesses in my time and I've made a point to switch the English part of their websites to the UK version instead of American, from translations down to the little flag
Μπράβο, καλή επιτυχία!
Ok here is some perspective from a non native speaker: American English is easier to pick up, because of the vast resources: many movies, series, songs, etc
In Greece (and I'd imagine many other European countries) there are mainly two institutions offering certification of proficiency, the university of Cambridge, and the university of Michigan
What happens is that the format of the first is harder than the second, as it has many different exercises, whereas the one from Michigan is multiple choice+essay+speaking, so most teachers will encourage going for Michigan
Furthermore it's cheaper
I can't tell you exact prices because I took mine about 13 years ago
On the cockiness
Does BE sound more cocky than AE to a non-native
Yes definitely
Do I care
Not at all, I love sounding cocky
I love the main accent, and every single accent associated with the UK
Surprisingly though, the biggest problem when someone tries to speak BE (again as a non native) is not picking up the accent, but distinguishing the words and expressions that are common in BE
Also I think BSL is cooler than ASL
The Darkfall MMO probably
All other games have been war simulators or stuff like that, which although some are highly rated, they're pretty niche
I think it's pretty popular here
It's one of my favorite series and I just have to say it gets even better in the next seasons
I'd like to thank Bulgaria for letting bygones be bygones and moving on
Thank you Bulgaria, because is Greeks can go there and buy things for really cheap
Thank you all for not letting our country die, I guess
ex yugoslavia left the thread
Thank you Turkey for the coffee and narghile, thank you Bulgaria for doing most of the hard fighting during the Balkan Wars, thank you North Macedonia for cevapcici and ajvar which I hope to one day see in a Greek restaurant, thank you Albania for having the chillest migrants in Greece
I'd like to think our participation in the European Union helped our relationship
Maybe in the future if more countries become better and get accepted we could avoid conflict in the Balkans
[ha ha]
Yo thanks for this, I was going to make the same remarks from the other side
I cannot in good conscience say anything else, in part because I'm also *very* aware of my Turkish heritage and also due to the massive mutual cultural influences
I was scared for Turks during the huge earthquake of 1999, I was scared for Turks during the attempted coup, and I'm scared for Turks now
Anyone who says I shouldn't be can kiss my tan, Mediterranean ass
A billion different kinds of budget-off-brand coca cola
I'm not even joking, I can remember at least a dozen off the top of my head
we have [λούξ (loux)] which is the Greek fanta
and [Green Cola] which is a cola type drink but with Stevia instead of sugar, i think it's become international and is being sold in a few other european countries now
We've had a total of 3 dictatorships if you don't count the Nazi, Italian and Bulgarian occupation in WW2
The first is the Pangalos dictatorship, it was short lived and moronic
Almost nobody remembers it or even knows it existed
Then from 1936 to 1941 we had the Metaxas dictatorship, which is viewed the most favourably out of the 3, simply cause although fascistic the only ones who really were affected negatively were slavs and communists, and since Metaxas was an expert in defensive warfare he was a huge part of the reason we were winning against the Italians in 1940-41
He died 2 months before the German invasion
And finally we have the 1966 to 1974 military Junta of the 3 officers
This is the one everyone in Greece remembers it as **the** dictatorship
Whilst the previous two were only hard for communists and left leaning people, this one was almost universally bad
All kinds of freedoms were suppressed, and in the end no side you could say was satisfied with their rule, leftists least of all
Moderate Right wingers hate them cause they played a huge part to the fact Cyprus is this fucked up today and left wingers for obvious reasons
The only good that came out of this dictatorship was economic growth and the modernization of the military not much else
As you can imagine none of these were particularly fun for communists and left wing politicians
Especially the Junta
But are any of them particularly taboo
The first two really aren't because one is forgotten and the other is tied with military glory
The last one though you could say is taboo, it has embedded a fear in the Greek mind that any short of extensive government intervention via police action is "the new Junta" which as you can imagine has led to a myriad of problems
There are also some right wing Junta sympathisers that like it cause they only see the "economy good and communists pawned" part, phrases like "but the Junta built roads" and "you were sleeping with the house unlocked" have become kind of a joke to mock sympathisers because they use them this often
In short, it is kind of taboo but at the same time no one shuts up about it
*(TL;DR Yes, the 3rd one, kinda)*
We had our fair share of dictators in the past
Firstly Ioannis metaxas is by many regarded as a hero because he denied Grazzi his ultimatum thus beginning the Greco-italian war
He was still, a dictator though
Then there's Papadopoulos who took power in 1967
(coup d'etat)
During the first years of his dictatorship, people couldn't go out after 9:00 PM, because soldiers had orders to shoot in sight
Many people praise him, and say stuff like "Yeah but because of that military Junta we have these" beautiful" streets now" Imo People who say shit like that aren't necessarily right-wingers
They're just uneducated
Not at all
Civil war, Economic Crisis & the 2015-2019 government are considered Taboo here instead
Talking about it isn't taboo but if you ever say it was better back in the Junta you might just get hut over the head for being a fascist
For this to make sense, I'll have to explain some stuff (the history may be boring but please read it)
So, we had had a military junta for seven years 1967-1974
The thing about it almost everyone forgets is that it didn't fell because of a mass uprising but because it was inherently unstable
The "president" then called Karamanlis, a politician who was prime minister before the junta, to return to the country and govern as a part of the junta
However, he pulled a trick on them and dissolved the military regime and called for elections, real elections not the staged ones the junta used as a legitimacy thing
Karamanlis won the elections (of course) and proceeded to transition the country to a real democracy, he managed to do that, it was a success story
A trial for the junta members was held in 1975, it was like the Greek version of the Nuremberg trial
The junta was over, many of the junta instigators went to prison for life and three of them were sentenced to death for their actions, but Karamanlis reverted them to life imprisonment as a show of good faith
AND THAT WAS THE FIRST MISTAKE, because those people didn't die in prison, they eventually got freed
A later government in 1990 (of the party Karamanlis had started) freed Pattakos (one of them the Juntists), who lived until 2016, spreading misinformation about the regime of 1967-1974
THIS inspired many Juntists to form their own party, Golden Dawn (yeah, ,, that Golden Dawn)
It is kinda taboo to reminisce about the junta, but because we did not take the correct steps to isolate these extremists from the public, the problem did not get solved (remember,,, Golden Dawn)
Furthermore, not everyone knows the details that I just described, they're not "taught" in school
Of course, we have the 17th of November remembrance anniversary, in which we celebrate a Polytechnic students' uprising, but it's not enough
You're just told of some bad things the junta did and that's it
Nothing about how the country was unstable before the coup d'état, the details, the junta's economic policy or even the facts I just mentioned
I'm sorry if I bored you, I just needed to vent my frustrations about the matter
They say all right wing sided politicians are no wirse then a junta that ran into a colledge campus and ended in a 1973, so like its bad but not as bad as the junta
The economic growth is a myth (growth had started back in 1963, so it had no relation with the Junta's economic policy)
They increased the national debt 10 times, from 15 billion Drachma to 114 billion Drachma
No one wanted to associate with the regime so no investments came, except some from the USA, and that's why NATO and the 'bloody' Americans are still kinda, sorta hated by some left-wingers
The modernisation of the military is true and that's why the debt increased, because the regime was encouraged to buy shit from the USA to contain the "COMMUNIST THREAT".
Also,..
>In short, it is kind of taboo but at the same time no one shuts up about it
So true
2015-2019 is not taboo just controversial
The civil we tho yeah, I believe it’s still the event that divides the country  and responsible for the political opinion of most people, left or right wing
I think the rule is Greeks can argue with each other about the Crisis, but when another  European tries to join the conversation, people shift uncomfortably in their seats and just stop talking or start attacking the poor EU citizen for intervening
As for the Syriza government, well, doesn't it depend if you're an Syriza left-winger or a anything else (New Democracy, KINAL, KKE or something different)
However, I must agree with you about the Civil War being a taboo topic
Like, how do people even think that the Civil War wounds are healed
Dunno tho, what do you think
(\*) Of course joking about the Junta is most of the times fine, romanticising it is taboo
A running joke is "Η Χούντα έφτιαξε δρόμους" (The Junta built roads), which is a joke, because (the Juntists use it to distract people from all the horrible things the military regime did and) it's used to ridicule them
Another one is "Ρε, αυτά δε θα γίνονταν με Χούντα!" (Hey, that would happen with the Junta
I learned English from music and video games
Nowadays there are very few games that can be in Greek mostly PS4 exclusives
Like God of War and lately Days Gone
So playing in English is the most common but when Greek language is available I will use it
Pretty much every video game translated in greek was horrendous
I was playing the God4 and i had to swich to English cause the sound actrors were horrible in Greek
In English because there aren't many games translated into Greek but I recently played God of War
The translation, adaptation and voice acting was spot on
I check if my language is available but I always put it on english, not just in games, but also in movies, on my devices etc
I'm just used to setting everything to english, also I think acoustically greek is only for comedies
Always English, it's really weird for games to be in Greek
There are people who prefer it though
What do you mean by that last part
Yeah sorry, I meant to write "is only good for comedies" but I forgot good
It's just that I personally can't hear greek on any other setting (action, horror etc
) and take the film/videogame seriously
That's the case in Greece as well
Apart from Greek, I speak English, French and Italian
Speaking as many languages as possible is a huge skill nowadays
I felt so nice being able to understand some Spanish when I was in Spain thanks to my Italian and I feel so sorry I quit studying German when I was younger because it seemed very difficult
I fall in love with every single language I come across, and that's too painful, especially if it's from a language group I'm not familiar with
I currently speak Greek, English, some Danish and a tiny bit of German and Spanish, lots of people would be impressed that I can hold a conversation in at least three languages, but it's nowhere near enough for me
I suppose he meant that Americans don't have the habit of learning a foreign language because you can get by with plain good ol' English
So, if there's no need, why learn one
These sound beautiful
Unfortunately I don't think Greece is the market for these items unless you count refrigerators
What exactly are they
Snow itself is hardly a common thing in my country
It looks beautiful, I'm definitely making this
Thanks
Or just come to the northwest buddy
Seems to be more of a cultural thing than a climate thing
It also gets quite cold where I'm from (usually -15°C although this year it hasn't even dropped below -5) but I haven't seen something like that either
Delightful
I love the snow so much, but I've moved away from my hometown and it doesn't snow that much where I live now
This winter has been so shitty, it's the first time it hasn't snowed in my hometown since before I was born
I don't remember any catastrophic explosion in Greece
Don't know if it happened when I was younger
My thoughts in the Beirut blast
I watched ,and I don't know why, all the videos I found on twitter and as I mentioned there I think it will be really hard for me to watch action movies and seeing people acting scared, when you ve seen real footage of people's lives being destroyed . Getting older makes you realize other aspects of something this magnitude happening .
Since no one has done my country, here it is
Turkey: We don't really have a problem with the people but we hate your government
Also history doesn't really help with the situation
Bulgaria: We don't really know much about you
You seem very similar to russians from our point of view
Albania: Mixed feelings
I love Albanians but there is generally some racism towards you in Greece
Hope you can fix up your country
Italy: We actually really like you guys
Also beautiful country
Spain: To us you are like Italy but a little weirder
NM: We're mad because of you name
No one really knows much about you, sorry
Cyprus: We all just kinda assume that your are in Greece
Germany: Sunburned tourists that wear socks with sandals
UK: Despite the Parthenon marbles, which are really important to us, we like you
Scandinavian countries: You seem too advanced and educated
Thank you my Hungarian friend
Love back ️
I am proud of some parts of our history, but others ooo boiii
(ahemm
dictatorship, aheemmm
The campaign to expand to Turkey about 100 yrs ago, aheemmm
Very very very great and honest politicians, modern state
But thank you very very much
Oh man you made me shudder while reading the comment about Greece
Vielen Dank
ich hoffe unsere Beziehung wird nicht so kompliziert bleiben
I love you
i CAN EASILY DRINK NOTHING ELSE
- Στου διαόλου το κέρατο (on the devil's horn)
- Στου διαόλου τη μάνα (at the devil's mom)
- Στη μέση του πουθενά (in the middle of nowhere)
- Στον γάμο του Καραγκιόζη (at Karagkiozis' (main character of an old greek shadow play) wedding)
- Στο μουνί χωριό (in the pussy village)
- Στο υπερπέραν (in the place that's very far away, usually also means a parallel universe)
- Στην άλλη άκρη του κόσμου/της Γης (on the other side of the world/the Earth)
We say "in Kolopetinitsa", a small village near Delphi, for something isolated and forgotten
For something really far far away, we say "by the Devil's mother".
We say "στου διαόλου την μάνα" (stu diaolu tin mana) which means "at the devil's mother"
I can't remember the other saying we have, but we have one saying: "In Zimbabwe" meaning a faraway land
In Greek, we say "stou diaolou ti mana" which means "at the Devil's mother".
+ "Στην κολοπετινιτσα" haha
I'll admit I haven't heard that one haha
Us too
And the people from areas that rear them are very proud of their recipes
We eat snails too, dunno bout frogs tho
Is this satire
Lol, if not literally only in Ioannina
Ok this image is actually kinda gross tho :P
In Greece we always just slurp them/pick them out their shell
So a plate would look something like [this]
In Greek language it's "έτοιμος η όχι, έρχομαι"
"Μπου και βγαίνω"
Basically "Boo and I am out"
I don't mind at all
I seriously find it cute when my female Ophthalmologist's Cypriot accent comes out by accident, in general I find different Greek accents fascinating
Italy : why is it considered an insult to the Italian culture to eat pizza and pasta at the same time
Turkey : How can a Muslim nation produce so many alcoholics
I visited Rome two years ago
In every cafe I went, I asked if I can be served a cappuccino freddo (cold cappuccino)
The answer was always NO
In fact, I couldn't find any type of cold coffee on the menus
My fellow Italians, how can you live without the pleasure of cold coffees
I don't understand why Turks will drive 5 hours to go to the beach and party in Alexandroupoli
It has probably the worst beaches in Greece and is an ugly city
Surely there are better nightlife and beaches closer to Istanbul
That's a thing here too
I never understood how my parents will feel tired if they miss their 2 hour nap
Good to know, thanks
Are these choices available everywhere
Although I did ask if I can have any other type of cold coffee (it was the middle of the summer and the temperature was rather high), I wasn't offered the choice of them as an alternative
Instead, they looked at me as I have offended them in some way just by asking
Anyway, what I find rather peculiar is the mere fact that cold coffees aren't popular in Italy
I really don't get how can that be
We live on cold coffee here in Greece, and not just during the summer months
Being both Mediterranean, I expected that this would also be the case in the country that has graced our lives with espresso and cappuccino
That's my point
How come they are not popular
Having a cold coffee, especially during summer months, is a bliss
Name
I'm often in Puglia and would love to order this
Try making it at home, if you're not given the choice elsewhere
Lol
Glad to be of service at least for the TIL part
As for the codfish, we mostly eat it fried along with skordalia (no, there is no cheese in skordalia)
I know enough as not to mess with a Portuguese on how to enjoy bacalhau ;)
There are more Greeks than you imagine who consider that big glass with frappe (the coffee you are referring to)  as the worst kind of coffee (personally, I like it)
I'm not an expert on the matter, but I know that there are various kinds of cold coffee - most are hot brewed and then served with ice, whereas there is also cold brewed coffee
As for its taste, It's obviously a case of 'one man's meat is another man's poison' ;)
I guess you've never been to Greece :)
Oh no, does that mean that I wouldn't have the pleasure of a cold coffee in Portugal as well
You have to try it before you judge it ;)
Cheese on seafood is a general no-no
Fish + cheese just doesn't go together
The main reason, among others, is that seafood/fish are light and delicate flavors and cheese just takes over, rendering the fish useless in the fish
For the hot sauce thing you have to dig into the Italian cuisine in order to understand why it's "weird". Italian cuisine is based on the simplicity of the dishes that highlight the products themselves
It's usually lighter on the palate, and if you put a hot sauce over that, you basically ruin that effect
Think of it as the opposite of American/BBQ food
Italian cuisine=you cover the light flavors,  fatty cuisine=you enhance the flavors and cut through the fat
I was not familiar with the fish pie, so I just read its recipe
Our Portuguese friend is not going to like it
Because you'll eat your coffee ice cream in a few minutes, whereas you will prolong your pleasure by slowly sipping your coffee for many more minutes ;)
TIL and skordalia
It seems I'm working for your benefit today :P
If you do try it, let me know if you liked it
Cold (or iced) coffees are extremely popular here throughout the year and there is no cafe where you wouldn't find them (except for, maybe, a traditional kafeneion in some village)
We mostly drink cappuccino or espresso freddo, and frappe (instant coffee shaken with cold water and sugar, then served on ice, with or without milk)
I initially thought that these coffees were pretty common everywhere, but then my travels abroad made me realise that it's mostly a Greek thing
Or that, at least, they are not so common in Europe, because I do have enjoyed a cold coffee in Montreal, Canada, and I was just reading that they are pretty popular in the US too
So, it doesn't surprise me that a Belgian hasn't heard of them
Still, it is surprising to me that cold coffees are not a part of the Mediterranean coffee culture in general
If you ever find yourself in Athens, send me a message and I'll tell you where to go for a really nice glass of cold coffee
Exactly
I think all cuisines are acceptable and can be delicious, but one has to judge them based on their context
For example, both my parents (Greek & Italian), especially my dad can be annoying with different cuisines, just because they judge them based on *their* standards, which are pretty much strictly Greek & Italian
So they can't understand why Indian food is good - my dad claims that just too much spice involved and he can't taste anything, nothing stands out
He can't understand that the point of a curry is the flavor of all those mixed spices
What do you think
I am not pretentious at all at what I said, and I am not your co-worker man
You just have to understand that different cuisines have different approaches
I tried to explain how Italian cuisine works, and I don't take back what I said because I know I am accurate on that, Italian cuisine is **all about** delicasy, so the hot sauce thing is 100% accurate
Even the spicy Italian dishes are extremely balanced
Not to mention that hot sauces are (besides very spicy), very flavorfull, so they cover everything else
Now, is your sushi coworker pretentious about the sushi thing
100%. I personally don't do that on sushi for the same reasons I described, so again I can't see how I'm pretentious
Lol man, McDonalds
No thanks
Exactly, you are right, good point
It is sad, but at the same time I understand it it's older generations
They just don't have the experience we do, you know
It's okay, don't worry :)
Haha, you got me with the Mydia
Personally not a big fan for the reasons I listed but if the Feta is not too much and the dish is done well, I like it
I also like pineapple on pizza, as long as is not too much - again it can become over-powering
So I assume in the mydia saganaki you make them at home in order to add the hot sauce right
because we don't really have hot sauces in greek restaurants, unless the dish itself has chilli flakes
I went to Turkey a couple of months ago
I was appauled by most fish dishes
They had a great product of fresh fish and they ruined it with butter, spices and peppers
The only thing I couldn't taste was fish, it's just a pitty
Um, Google
It's even a verb γκουγκλάρω /guglaro/.
We also use Merenda (Nutella knock off) for cocoa derivatives we spread on bread
We say UHU for glue stick
That's all I can think of right now
chocolate spread - Merenda
cream cheese - Philadelphia
?sponge cloth
(used for cleaning) - Wettex
big cars like those Jeep makes
idk how you call them - Jeep
diapers - Pampers
chocolate milk - Milko
compressed milk - NOYNOY milk
any search engine - Google
In Greek the car brand's name "Jeep"  is used to refer for an SUV vehicle no matter if it's an BMW, VW etc
The first one that comes to mind is [Merenda] it's basically like nutella but Greek and Nutella and all it's clones fall under the category of Merenda
The other is Black & Decker the word has deteriorated to blackedecker and it means [those] handheld drills though i've noticed that that is slowly dissapearing
Edit: u/stefanos916 reminded me that
Jeep is used to refer to anything that looks like it can do offroad and is on 4 wheels
Coca-cola too
Jeep ( τζίπ ) for SUV’s
Also:
Wettex for those thin sponges that are used for spilled liquids
Ajax for window cleaning spray
Fairy/Ava for dish detergent
Teza for any type of bug spray
Also:
* Black & Decker for power tools, more specifically electric drills
* Sikaflex for polyurethane based sealants
* Post-it for sticky notes
* Sellotape for sticky tape
* Tupper (from Tupperware) for plastic containers used for storing food
* Thermos for vacuum flasks (even those that are "regular flasks" but resemble vacuum flasks are called Thermos)
>We also use Merenda (Nutella knock off)
Watch your f$%@!+ mouth
Do Portuguese use the Jeep to refer to SUV vehicles no matter the manufacturer
If you eat it, it's going to be a 24h a day snack
Oh shit yeah let me add those too
Then we have that in common
Not dragon in Greece, but we call a kite an eagle "αετός"
No, the Greek word for kite is "χαρταετός" literally "paper-eagle".
āetós is what I found . The truth is as we don't use Latin alphabet we don't think about the Latin pronunciation unless we have some interest in linguistics or people study them
There is no standard way to transcribe Greek into Latin alphabet, as there are often more than one or none equivalent letters for the same phoneme
I suspect it is the same issue for any two alphabets
If you are interested in a word's pronunciation, you can look it up with its original spelling in forvo
com .
How can I unread a comment
Thinking the same
I´ve said lots of similar dad jokes while on vacation and I can only hope locals didn´t take them at face value
Another user already said it, we call the rest of the country επαρχία (eparchia)
It is an official term, so it is not derogatory but people from Athens will sometimes refer to non-athenians as "eparchiotes" in a derogatory tone, as in uncivilised or stupid
Some Athenians do use the term η επαρχία (i eparhía, the "countryside"), but it's mainly for rural areas, not cities
Yeah I thought Greek was rare, then had embarrassing conversation in public (in Greek obv) and found out about the 400,000
Greeks in Montreal
When I was in high school we went to Venice for a school trip
I remember waiting in line to buy gelato with my friends and commenting how good looking the guy in front of us was
(he was about our age)
Having the false security of being in another country where no one spoke Greek I went on and on about how handsome he was (nothing inappropriate mind you)
After getting his gelato the guy turned around, looked me in the eyes with a huge grin greeted me in Greek and left
It turned out a school near ours was also having a school trip to Venice at the same time
Lol
Ναι και όχι
Μια φορά στο Λονδίνο όταν ήμουν πιο μικρός μιλούσα με την μάνα μου στα Ελληνικά και ένας δίπλα μας άρχισε να μας μιλάει και αυτός στα Ελληνικά και είχε πλάκα, είχε έρθει και αυτός για κάτι δουλειές φαίνεται λμαο
Αλλά όχι δεν ήταν embarrassing
I was in Nuremberg once with my school, we had gone to a cafe
Few tables further down two semi-old (I mean I was at school, anything above 25 was "old") ladies were staring at us
While looking at them I told my friend in Greek, "why are those hags staring at us
" On the way out one lady asked about us, what we were doing, which school, city etc
The other lady also mentioned (in German not Greek) that there are others who speak and understand our language
I think she may have been referring to the word "hag" I used to refer to them
It's fair, but like why keep staring throughout our stay at the cafe (?), it didn't seem we were bothering anyone
My story is not that interesting, literally all I said was that once in London I was speaking in Greek and a stranger next to me said hello in Greek
I thought I would just reply directly to OP since I felt like I could relate to them as we are both Greek and both have a "story" taking place in London
I'm not withholding secret information from the general public, I just basically said "same happened to me" in our language
I don't think that any added value would be given to others on here with my comment basically just saying "lol same"
So your reply: Unnecessary
Those that stand out are that people in Berlin used to be dressed with dull colours avoiding to wear 'loud' brands, big logos and striking prints/patterns in their daily life
Also in the UK, a lot of younds wear casually pieces that are here regarded formal, like brogues, shirts, Oxford boot etc
Another thing is that nobody wears desert boots here butthey seem common throughout North Europe
I only found Spaniards to dress very similar to Greeks and some East Europe countries like Czechia or Serbia
I've been to Italy twice and I had pretty much the same experience that you had
The Italians are too perfectly dressed
Hahaha, fair point
I was referring to winter styles
Since a lot of people have mentioned driving to nearby countries (for those living in border regions), we also have to aknowledge cheap flights
We have a lot of low cost carriers (at least pre-corona) and as others have mentioned we just need an ID for travelling inside the EU (+ some other countries) so a lot of people travel for work or leisure frequently
Just before the pandemic, I travelled to Manchester from Thessaloniki, Greece (almost 4 hr flight) for just €40 roundtrip
Some months before that I had booked a roundtrip ticket to Berlin for just €20
I would usually travel abroad 1-3 times a year, but not to my neighboring countries, I prefer the northern European ones
I've only driven to another country once, and it took about 7 hours
That's true and sadly this will change for good
OP, once you get from Greece to Italy you just drive through every country
I vaguely remember showing an ID in Swiss borders but then I think they stopped doing that after a few months
My dream is to do the roadtrip again and include as many countries as possible
The first time we drove/used ferries from Greece to Ireland
It took us 5 days because our dog's passport had the **order** of the vaccines the other way around and we couldn't take her on the ferry in Calais
Anyway, if that hadn't happen we would have done it for sure in 2,5 days, with stops for sleep
France has great rest stops along the way
I would say the Turkish word "Tefter" =book for writing notes etc
We added an "i" making it Tefteri/ Τεφτέρι. Though it's used only by boomers
It must be Albanian - I never thought about it
Perhaps French/German would be officially more popular, but that's school level, not actually spoken
For sure Albanian
There are plenty of Albanians here due to the easy access in the 90s. Maybe Russian or Romanian is the third one
Either Albanian (through immigration) or Turkish in Thrace or Slavic dialects in Macedonia and Thrace (Regions in Greece)
the youngest generation is very good at it even though no one learns shit at school
at school they have some old Dell computers with windows XP and everyone just plays Friv on them even though they can barely run it
but for some reason the average teen know how to pirate games and use microsoft office
in Greece we have 2 kinds of high schools the "Professional high school" aka EPAL (Epagkelmatiko Lykio) and the general high school aka GEL (Geniko Lykio) where on epal you choose a job you want and barely do any other subjects (for example if you want to be a mechanic there are engines there you can work on and actual good PCs) where you learn about programming and softwarer engineering
Almost everyone I've met age 18-45 has at the very least smoked weed a couple of times
Recreational use every once in a while is very common with people in my age group (mid-20s)
Even older people have a neutral or even positive view on cannabis use
The main group that's against cannabis use is deeply religious and conservative people
It's considered illegal though and being caught with >1g on you means you'll most likely get arrested, but even cops are not that harsh on users, they mainly care about getting info on people that sell weed
a tad bit too popular
i know quite a few people who have smoked
i've seen it being done in front of me more than once
Yeah, it's a common joke in Greece that if the cops catch you with x amount of weed, they will report that they caught you with x minus a gram because they'll keep it for themselves
Since Syriza left and Nea Dimokratia has become the ruling party, police has become a little bit stricter in general, especially on younger people
Actually they are not stricter, they just get a pass for being assholes
I'm not sure if they are more relaxed about weed though
I'm not sure
My (not that educated) guess is that actions like this persuade people with more conservative views, that the police has been doing work to establish order
Thankfully not really, except for one: Χρήστος, and the female version Χριστίνα.
Now, Χριστός is the Greek name for Christ and it is spelled with an iota instead of an eta like Χρήστος. However some people spell Χρήστος as Χρίστος and honestly I have no idea why
Also for some reason Χριστίνα is normally spelled with an iota, but some will spell it with an eta
We don't generally misspell names because we name mostly after specific people and also names have specific name days (most pertaining to Christian saints who died on that day) when they are celebrated
So you don't name your kid Ελαίνη (Eleni) because it makes no sense, you name her Ελένη.
My friend who teaches at an Italian primary school has a student called Daiana
Not yet because I'm still saving money
If there wasn't a pandemic it would be way easier for me, it will probably take me around 2 years
Planning on moving to Spain or maybe a Latin American country
Colder than Iceland
We have an entire direction (east) dedicated to that
Greece is isn't very densely populated, so there are quite a few places like that, mainly around the more mountainous regions, where land can't really be used for farming
Additionally, there's loads of small uninhabited islands that offer pure isolation
Yeah, but you can't really live as a hermit in the mainland
Most mountains have small villages built on them
In all my life I've never encountered a mountain road that didn't lead to a village
Plus, mountains not being very good land for farming doesn't stop some people from farming them
As for the islands, I suppose that if you found an island that was fertile enough and you had a way to solve the water problem then living there in isolation wouldn't be too far fetched
Agrafa mountains would probably be the closest to empty I think
Considering that a large number of the XIXth century prime ministers were born outside our (then) borders, then no, none at all
Keep in mind though that the constitution prohibits the office of the President of the Republic to a natural born citizen
I think it wouldn't be such a big deal
The first King of Greece was Austrian
I'm a bit confused
By Greek do you mean place of birth or ethnic self identification
Because for the first I can see that there are exceptions to what you describe ([ex
1] [ex
Ah, I see
Well that makes sense given the, unfortunately, rocky relations between our two countries
Italy
We share lots of history, mythology, and even modern day cultural aspects (especially western regions of Greece), plus the phonology of (modern) Greek is entirely based on Latin, and it all started with them defeating us ~2150 years ago
No hard feelings about WWII, we love you <3
Time and reconciliation heals everything; your still our best bud
Yes, but they are typically well spelled
Absolutely
NYPD and Harvard are among the most common
I have two hoodies like that, but I've never actually read what is written on them
Yeah, we have these a lot
Taking all words literally and not the real meaning
cold and boomer jokes are popular
also some the west might consider racist
True we got lots of racist stuff
our country
The Thessaloniki metro
The plans and the construction started so long ago and they still aren't done
Its a running gig that if something unlikely to happen, people will say "I will happen when the metro of Thessaloniki finishes". Current projections say that will be around 2024
Also the bus system in Thessaloniki (my fellow Greeks you know the pain of ΟΑΣΘ)
It unites us as a nation to complain about it and it is really awful
Good news though with the Corona virus not many people use it and it is a 2/10 rather a -100/10( source: I live in Thessaloniki)
We have the same with the Thessaloniki Metro
Its construction started in the 80s and latest estimates say it will be opened in 2023
Most definitely
Isn't that a French thing
"Right now"? That implies there was a time when they weren't XD
Yup, I tend to follow the politicis of as many countries as I can
Especially the ones in which there is often drama like Italy, Spain and Poland
Some others are less interesting to the observer, like Germany and Portugal
That is actually good of them, cause it means stability
I'm mostly interested in greek politics, although I'm also following - _not that closely but still_ - US politics
I'm generally fairly interested about different issues in different parts of the globe, but I have more interest about my country's.
Ireland has a very weird political spectrum :
1) The nationalists are not the far-right (there is no far-right) but the far-left
2) The party registered as Liberal (Renew group) is actually more socially conservative than the party that is registered in the EPP group
Although I see Fianna Fail and Finn Gael as pretty similar in most issues to be honest
3) They have a weird transferable vote system
I live in Ireland too, and I think that despite it being a generally very well run country, and their politics do not incude the lunatics that ours do, they are intentionally ignoring the extremely high rents of Dublin
Ioannina city
Especially in the the winter, It's situated next to a large lake, making it very foggy
It's full of antique buildings, crooked trees and a huge menacing castle wall that surrounds a part of the city
It also has a large psychiatric clinic so there are many crazy people about
It's basically Greek Gotham
Very common
I remember a party when I was 13 and the girl's parents were there too
We were allowed to drink still
My dad gave me ouzo when I was 8 while we were eating in a tavern, he was laughing his ass off when he saw my face burning lol
In general booze is there, usually beer with Sunday meals, but the attitude in drinking is different than in other places
Nobody likes people getting wasted on alcohol
So from an early age you learn there is a limit
Also, you learn to have eaten before you drink and basically use booze occasionally within context
In bars if they see you clearly underaged, they might not let you in but usually they do especially if you're with a group of older people than you
By law it's 18 but nobody really goes by that
You start heavily drinking from 18 to mid 20s usually when you're away in Uni or college
But soon after that it is normal to stop and go back to occasional drinking
A few people that are already bad drivers tend to drink and drive and they're killers on wheels but there isn't much you can do with those retards other than the police have regular checks points where they can bust them
Usually by 12 or 13 people drink, they don't really get drunk until like 14 or 15
This has been asked more than a million times here
Do people like hearing underage drinking stories
Technically the legal age is 17 but everyone says fuck that and starts drinking at 14
I can confirm this comment is accurate
I can confirm too
Also it's not uncommon to see 14 year olds drink [mavrodaphne] or Nàma, they also give it in mass at the church with antidoron, or something like that
Try vergina weiss if you're into wheat beer, it's one of the better weissbiers i've had, even compared to some pretty high profile brands
Also their lager is very good, especially for its low price
I can confirm with my experience
My sister used to drink Gordon Space a lot when she was kid
I remember i tasted a bit of alcohol in the past and i didn't liked it
Also I even had a situation on school with one classmate which his mother put Tsipouro on his school bag instead of water
I'm gonna chip in for Greece, let's see:
Arranged from most seats to least:
Nea Dimokratia (New Democracy): The current leading party
Typical conservatives, pro free economy, pro European
One of the oldest right wing parties in Greece
Syriza: The former government and opposition leader right now
Although they are often characterized as left wing, I  would describe party' policies mostly as center left
Movement for change: Used to be known as PASOK
Center left once more but less progressive or left wing than Syriza
KKE (communist party): The oldest party in Greece
Typical communist party, used to be pro Soviet Union, now embracing euroscepticism
Greek Solution: Far right party
Embraces nationalism, Grexit, pro Russian, anti abortion, anti LGBT
Their leader sells scam medicine on TV (I don't know why he isn't in jail)
MeRA25: Varoufakis' project
Pro European, left wing progressives that seek the economic reform of European Union
I'm Greek and I had to google some of the parties
Diem is Varoufakis and Movement of Change is (mostly) Pasok
Nothing wrong with the way you wrote it
It's just that new parties keep popping up (and Pasok changes its name-allies almost every election)
It's a British thing, not getting too involved basically haha
Another good example is "How are you
", "Not too bad". So are you good or are you bad
Νομιζω πιο καλα απο το honorable θα ταιριαζε το decent
You don't have to drop the ν, it's not Cypriot only
Hahaha good one
Yeah I know exactly what you mean
As an ex-immigrant to the UK who is curious about social structures, it makes complete sense why you guys use these phrases
After all, phrases are quite reflective of how a society works
Greece is the opposite end of that for example, where the phrases we use reflect our inability to "filter" speech, "saying it as it is" so to speak
So they are very direct
I think so
I described it to another user that mentioned the same, but they are American
It's the same comment thread if you wanna have a look
Not my experience, it's a fossilized expression
Hahah shit
I feel you, I am very pale and get sunburnt straight away
However, after living in the UK and returning to Greece I have concluded that I'd rather have 3 months of extreme heat (which in air conditioned spaces & during the night is fine) than constant weather that's a pain in the ass
I am not a depressive person, but after a few years there were days that I found myself not able to get out of bed because of the constant grim weather
Also, in the UK you can never count on the weather because it can turn around so easily
Perhaps find a country like Portugal or so, it's somewhere in between if you go to the north
Yes, I never disputed that the retention of the final ν wasn't a Cypriot characteristic, it's just that personally as a Greek person interacting with other Greeks my age (under or around 20) have never had such a reaction or even considered it strange
I thought it was akin to phrases such as πρώτον, δεύτερον, etc
that sound weird to me without a ν. Cheers
I guess it's an appropriate time to say "fair enough"!
Just your name and surname
Some people have two names and they choose one and the other is treated like a middle name
I have 2 last names
Multiple first names are actually quite common, though not prevalent
It is also very common to give the child the name of a grandparent
I have personally met many people who have multiple first names specifically to please multiple grandparents
I also know several cases of a main first name that is Christian (George, Eleutherios), and a second being from Ancient Greek mythology or history (Achilles)
I guess the parents couldn't decide between a normal and a cool name
it is a really really uncommon thing but the circumstances were responsible for this
in England you get your mom's name here in Greece you get your dad's name and I was born in England and since my parents wanted to come back so I had to get both names
so, you shouldn't be sorry :)
Since I'm Greek, I guess getting ready for the revolution
Propably die in the Greek revolts tbh
Preparing to fight in the Great Revolution of 1821
> Farmer
> Goes to church for 3 to 4 hours a day
> Reads rebellious poems to his 6 children (and spanks them afterwards)
Tasks for tomorrow:
> Picking up tomatoes and cucumbers
> Pissing & shitting on my Ottoman neighbour's property
Get in patrioti, we are taking Motherland back
Grab your rifle,we gotta take our freedomback
Give us another 2 years and we'll join you
Giouuuurgiaaaa
πρεπει αν ρωτησω πως βαζεις παραπανω απο μια σημαιες?
The adjective normally is written like this "patriotis- πατριώτης".
But when we want to call out to someone we use the clitic case and patriotis becomes patrioti
For example ",Hey patrioti have you have been
So saying "Hey patriotis, doesn't make sense"
Concluding you could say that it's the same excluding some differences
Well, Italian and Greek share many words since Latin also used Ancient Greek words
there is always an exchange in languages
:) also found this:
patriot
late 16th century: from French *patriote*, from late Latin *patriota* ‘fellow countryman’, from Greek *patriōtēs*, from *patrios* ‘of one's fathers’, from *patris* ‘fatherland’.
Correct
Yes, There will be an economic backlash from China but if we have a unanimous stance on the issue that backlash will be an duble edge short for them
Anyway we shouldn't relay havily on undemocratic regims such as China Rusia Turkey etc ...
I would prefer more political and economic cooperation between EU member states rather than with dispute territories
Here we think Santa Claus lives in Lapland
But our own Santa Claus version (actually the two saints have been kind of merged together) is Saint Basil from Caesarea, Cappadocia (today in Turkey)
I'm not aware how it works for other orthodox Christian churches, but for the Greek orthodox church, our equivalent is Saint Basil/Άγιος Βασίλης, that lives on Caesarea of Cappadocia, in Asia Minor (modern day Turkey)
He visits on new year's day, instead of Christmas
Saint Nikolaos is the patron saint of the mariners instead, and consequently the patron saint of Hellenic Navy as well
I am guessing it is the same in Cyprus
Many people believe that [mount Olympus] is not an actual mountain but just a mythological place
A Czech guy who thought that we still believe in Zeus and the Olympians as our gods
Plus many are surprised to find out that we do have winter with minus temperatures and snow
It's at the borders of the districts of Thessaly and Macedonia in North - central Greece
There's always a bit of truth and history in every Greek myth
Most of the times the locations and the action that took place are correct, it's when the monsters, God's and  heroes appear when the myth part kicks in ;)
I don't know which is our most embarrassing tech moment
All I know is that we would never pay for Windows XP
We just use a cracked version of the software we need
Which word from your native language you wish could translate perfectly in English but doesn't?
Not a word, but μεν/δε. It's kinda annoying to type the full "on one hand/on the other hand" because there isn't something better
Μαλάκας (Malákas) simply because I use it the most
The Greek word φιλότιμο (philótimo)
It means something like earnestness, but not exactly that
For the word εύνοια (evnia) there isn't exactly one on one translation
ἑταῖρος (etéros) is another one, meaning: companion/comrade/friend/partner/pupil/disciple/associate/ _in plural:_ the cavalry of the Macedonian Kings
Note: these are ancient Greek and modern Greek meanings of the word
The word ιδού (eethoo) cannot be directly translated
It's like the French voíla
Actually, it could maybe be translated as lo or behold, but I'm not sure these words cover its whole meaning
Άρα (ara) can be roughly translated to: consequently/therefore/so/accordingly, but doesn't have a real equivalent
Άραγε (ˈaɾaʝe) is used when you're wondering about sth
Γιατί *άραγε* δεν έχει έρθει ακόμη;
=*I wonder* why hasn't he come yet
Many Greek words have been borrowed in English, so it's more difficult to find words that don't have a 1:1 translation
Edit: added words
We need that so bad
I'm still an amateur as a German speaker but couldn't doch translate as "indeed"?
We kinda have an equivalent word in Greek
We say εικοσιτετράωρο which literally means "24houred" more or less
So you can say 1 εικοσιτετράωρο =1 24houred, 2 24houred etc
the former and the latter
That's one of the things I like the most about Danish
In Greek you can say "my relationship" if you don't wanna specify the gender but that's gonna basically out you as homosexual even if you're not
It's kinda lame
I love the word kæreste
That's good too but can't be used for every instance
If I want to say "Mr Johnson did X men, but Mr Smith did Y de", former and latter won't be of any use
Yup, I can't translate it word by word but we use it to suggest that sth is "just right"/"as is should be", mostly meaning that it is ideal for the circumstance at hand
For example, if sb watches a movie which feels "just right" for that specific time/setting/mood, he may say that "the movie is oti prepei", even if he thinks that the movie is generally kinda bad or stupid
Well in that case wouldn't it be a πλεονασμός in Greek as well
As long as you're saying "but" you don't also have to use "men/de" do you
Idk I could be wrong though
Yeah the "but" is perhaps superfluous yet point stands, I usually have to type long sentences/alter the sentence
Men/de is so neat and tidy
True I like it, makes words flow much easier
Literally all the residential buildings
After ww2, greeks starter building cheap, short (5-7 floors) and minimalistic (not the modern art way, but just plain concrete) houses, who were obviously built with practical reasons in mind and had appearance completely forgotten
So, the entirety of athens looks like a pile of ugliness because of those buildings
First question: yes, since 3rd year up until the 12th
Worth to note that years 3-10 and also year 12 is strictly Christianity, and year 11 is 2/3 Christianity and 1/3 other religions, of which we skip a lot and basically just talk very briefly about Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism, probably making many wrong assumptions about them in the process
As to your second question, because our Karens think we have to and Karens are the only ones who bother to vote, so the system appeases them
Yes, and Idk why
If we were learning about every religion in the world,that would make sense
But no we only have orthodox Christianity, basically being shoved down our throats
Ffs
yes, i don't know how to justify it but we teach Greek Orthodox Christianity and recently we started learnign about other Religions too and how they differ from ours
also if a student doesn't belive in god or believes in a diffrent religion their parents have to sign a paper so they can be excused from that lesson
Yes, we learn about Christianity in primary and middle school and in high-school we study "Theology", meaning that we touch on other religions too (mostly Abrahamic)
Yes
A couple years ago, when we had a center-left wing government they tried to remove it but most of the people lost their mind, thus nothing changed
Of course they teach us about our own religion, not all famous ones or something
Sadly, religion is a big part of our country
We have a teacher who is willing to debate with the students(about abortion, homosexuality etc)
When she says stuff like "I don't believe there can be an atheist person" you kinda understand how close-minded and dumb  she is
When you meet a European you need to give them a kiss in the cheek even if you never met them before
If you were to move your country's capital, which city would you choose
and why
In Greece other option is Thessaloniki
Is the second largest city with about a million people and basically is de facto the “capital” of Northern Greece
Also is closer to other European states like Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania in comparison with Athens
I say we move it every year with a torch
If someone steals the torch and moves it to their city then that becomes the capital
Just to make it as hectic, confusing and annoying for them as they make it for us
The only possible candidate is Thessaloniki but it's too far north , anything other than Athens doesn't make much sense economically, geographically and even Strategically
αν θεωρησουμε οτι θα ειχε και τον ιδιο πληθυσμο με Αθηνα τοτε η Λαρισα. ειναι η καλυτερη περιοχη για να εχεις μια πολη 5 εκατομμυριων με σχετικη ανεση χωρου.
Didn't Copenhagen make more sense as a capital when Denmark had control over the southern Swedish provinces
Nafplio, the old capital would also be a good choice
Amazing looking city with tons of history
I went to Milan last year and oh boy it was a shittown
θα έλεγα και εγώ το ίδιο. ίσως και ο βόλος, επειδή, γιατί όχι;
Sparta is too south and also almost a village at this point
Thanks bro
The name is great; the coal pollution not so much
Greece
As important as the colour of the walls in the downstairs loo
We are important in the maritime sector, especially to everything coming from Asia and the fact that we have the biggest merchant fleet
We are also a shield for the main bulk of current immigration for Europe whether you wanna admit it or not we are just here to play border guard
We are also a source for cheap highly educated workforce, in the last decade we had about 500k people leave to find a better future, most of them are university degree owners that see no future in our country
Finally we are a nice, warm and cheap location for well off north Europeans to retire to
Oh and I guess we are of a major importance in the essence of European culture, crating democracy the whole advancements int arts, science and philosophy that were the basis for much of the enlightment but that is mostly symbolic
Every country is necessary for EU to exist
Even the smaller one
Every member together creates the EU
Without EU individually we cant compare to other strong nations
We are so different but we are still the same
We use most of us the same coin, we share most of us the values of Christianity, we speak one language
We try to stay together so we can be strong and progress among the other nations
Without EU we will be unable to compete other strong nations
We can go to Space together
Trade in better terms with others economies
Feel not a stranger visiting other eu members
So together we are building all of this
I guess we have to thank Germany & France for organising all of it
Geopolitically, Greece cannot be considered “black sheep”. It’s not surprising that Greece was the 10th country to join EU back then
It's great overall, but also doesn't give you access to the entire healthcare system
In Greece, a lot of people also get private insurance for some of the private hospitals and clinics which typically have better doctors
Honestly, compared to what I was paying in the US, it's just incomparable for what you get here
personally i can't find any downsides to this
i've had 3 surgeries and i'm only 17, the only thing we had to pay for was snacks
i've seen Americans say that healthcare=higher taxes which is not that big of a problem
Dutch sounds like the same language from the game The Sims
I'm lowkey terrified of written polish
They sounds so damn nice though
Spoken Danish
And that's why I fucking love it so much, can't wait to be able to understand a single spoken sentence
I'm laughing my ass off,this description was  on point
Greek Civil War
> Keep in mind: I am Greek
Greek Civil War took place exactly after WW2
Basically communist guerilla fighters refused to hand down their weapons claiming that Greece wasn't free yet (referring to the people that came in power and also to the British influence within the country)
For Greece, there were more loses in this war than in WW2
Literally almost nothing is being teached about this within the Greek educational system and in a way it's considered taboo
Growing up I started noticing things (like bitterness) within our society that pointed out to this war
Also there is this hate/dislike towards the communists but it makes no sense
We have had politicians saying that they would prefer see the country in flames than empowering the communist party with their actions
Also politicians from the current government use the terms "left" and "communist" as if it is a danger for our society
Edit: mistakes
I would totally recommend "Blueprint for Armageddon". A series of 6 podcast episodes by Dan Carlin
Really the guy goes through all the major events of the war
Take about the geopolitical intentions of the participants
Well, my comment was more about the stigma that's left over from this war and the polarization that it has created within the Greek society than an discussion over ideological believes
Basically the war happened because the people that came in power after the war were the same people that controlled things during the nazi occupation
The communist guerilla fighters were the resistance during the occupation
These two points created a big schism within an already broken society which lead to a full blown war
During the Greek Civil War it was the first time that Napalm was used
Pretty hardcore stuff
The BIG problem is that there is no way that you can get your hands on actual truth
There is no way that you can find sources that are not biased over the subject
Same situation with the Greek Civil War
There are mentions in the history book in the final year of high school but they never teach it
You are correct
But Greece isnot like Romania for example, where you had a communist regime and so on
The thing is that Greece, politically, was always leaning on the right wing
We had a great number of dictators and coups throughout the 20th century and corruption was always nourished within the society
This always has had the effect of polarizing the people
Nowadays, the current government is very active on this part
Left wing is bad
They are spreading covid
They even use the political views of some civilians as an excuse for beating them up(police brutality)
All of these have roots within the Greek Civil War
Understanding both sides is vital to make the society progress forward and cleanse any stigma that exists
In highschool, the day starts at 8:15
Each school day has 7 school hours, which are 45 mins each
The two first hours and last hours have no break between each other
So we get 4 breaks
The first break is 15 mins, and after that its two 10 mins and the last break is 5 mins
School ends at 14:05
In Greece is pretty much exactly the same as you but lessons start at 8:15 (8:20 if you don't count prayer)
We start with prayer at 8 15, then go into the classroom
Depending on the grade, you can have feom 5 up to 7 hours of lessons each day, and maybe 8 or 9 in music high school and private schools
The length of each period varies; first is 45 mins, 2nd is 50, 3rd is 45, 4th to sixth are 40 amd 7th is thirty, though that might not be true for each school
Between the periods you have 10-minute breaks, except for after 1st and 7th periods, where the break lasts 5 minutes
A typical school day in high school and middle school ends at around 2pm
Fought a revolution against an empire while fighting a 3-way civil war at the same time and going into debt through bad management and regional politics, lost in military terms but actually won outright
The Olympic Games of 2004
Everything was done in a typical Greek style
Too much talking and last minute planing
Also, literally days before the opening day, constructors had to work like crazy to finish the stadiums etc
And yet again, everything went smoothly
In greece id say 15th August, saint virgin marys day
Its a holiday in the hottest days of summer, all of us go to the beach usually
Mostly we visit our ancestral cities/ villages
Every small nearly abandoned village hosts a festival with live music, food drinks and stuff
Its the day that everyone is outside, distant relatives get together and every village fills with people
i think it’s kinda both in greece
some people celebrate it and have dinners on the 24th and exchange gifts on the 25th
for my family we only celebrate it on the 25th
oh we also count the 26th as the second day of christmas
we celebrate Christmas on the 25th and go to the church and we get our presents at 12 am 1st of January
(this may differ from house to house)
yeah tbh it was surprising for me to see in the comments that other orthodox countries celebrate it in january 7
it was the first time i heard about it
maybe it’s just because i’m not religious
yeah well, most greeks aren’t that strict orthodox christians
most just fast one week before easter and that’s it
idk, maybe it isn’t as usual as i thought
but i know several people that have big dinners on christmas eve
[Only thing missing is a cane]
Most tourists in Greece go to islands like Mykonos, Santorini and Crete
Most tourists that go to Greece are British, Turkish, Russian and Spaniards
The tourists that go to mainland go to Athens and  Thessaloniki
Those are the most common places that tourists go to but there are more places
Definitely Santorini and Mykonos
Santorini for the middle classes and Mykonos for the rich
I believe when someone thinks of Greece, he thinks about Acropolis-Santorini-Mykonos
There are also other places, like Thessaloniki, which are too underrated
Santorini and Mykonos both very beautiful islands but overrated because all of the islands are beautiful
Santorini and Mykonos
i'm sure you all know what those are and why
Meteora monasteries are also one of the top destinations in the entire country
Oh yeah I forgot
Thanks
I would say I know most of the names of the states, just not always where they are located
most people only know the names of the typical like Texas, Florida, New York and that's about it but personally i can point out most of them on map (i have to say you guys were too bored when you were drawing borders)
also bare in mind most people can tell from a mile away that you're from the US, i live in a coastal city and i like to guess where foreigners are from in the summer cause they all stick out like shore thumb
> even Ross couldn't all though he had all of Thanksgiving
That's because he's a dummy, Joey actually got 56
Even their country’s name is an abbreviation
Can't really explain it but if you look at a German and a Greek aide by side you too would be able to tell them apart
I find it surprising that nobody has said Greek considering that we use an entirely different alphabet
Grammar and spelling is really where people struggle
Spelling in particular is extremely hard as we have different letter combinations that represent the same letter (like ι can be written like η, ει, and οι, all depending on the word and context)
Yes, a million times yes
I'm glad because my country would be far worse without it
I'm not talking about the economy,  but about the EU policies that kind of force the state to act more responsibly and with more transparency
I'm also glad because I really like the idea of a European Union
The fact that European countries have agreed to work together and that hopefully one day all Europeans will be part of the same union is amazing to me
The union isn't perfect
There are many things that I would like to be different in it, but it's a start
As long as we keep working together the European Union will get better and stronger
Why do you hate Italy tho
Ahem can I join
Thats sad man
Such a beautiful country
The similarities between Greece and Romania on topics like this really show how toxic the eastern orthodox church is
I’m curious, how did these people feel about loosing the war
When and where was he imprisoned
I suppose the French released their POWs in 1940 (?)
Add some romance in to it and you’ve got an Oscar nominee
Ye that is interesting
I have seriously been thinking of moving to Germany, and even though I know the younger generation is nothing like what the Germany of 1940 was, I still find the thought of facing the older people’s racist ideologies scary
The Greek Wikipedia generally has severely less information as well as articles compared to the English one
I only really use it for regional matters relating to Greece
Unless it's one of those rare cases where an English article about Greece itself may be better than the Greek equivalent of it
Because I've seen that too
i don't mind using the Greek wikipedia but i prefer the English one cause it usually has more info and it's more unbiased
It's completely normal, except if you live in specific areas where the water is dirty
Even then, bottled water is pretty cheap
Antifa and Anarchists love to destroy property in the district of Exárchia in Athens
In the Industrial district Asprópyrgos (west Attica) there is a kind of common problem of Gypsies stopping and stealing trucks (has happened to two of my dad's colleagues but they didn't manage to get the trucks)
Our capital is probably the dirtiest in all of Europe
Seriously if you plan to visit Athens make sure to bring a hazmat suit, a gas mask, some military boots, and a portable nuclear bunker just to be sure
Oh damn
That's serious shit
What's the situation with Organ calling all these emergency powers with no plans to give them back
How's the population reacting to this
Hate not being able to go out for a simple walk at night cause some stray bastards will fall on ya
Wow
...that's very sad to hear ngl, I suppose a lot of people don't see how it will impact their lives directly in the short future
Hopefully by the time they realise it won't be too far gone
Is healthcare expensive
Bydgoszcz
so Poland has some good ol big cities I see
edit: and the only city I didn't know in the list
given the opportunity I want to thank the european maps of Railroad Tycoon 3 that made me the geography buff I am
What are some tips for learning your country’s language
**Pronunciation wise:** if you can speak Spanish, you've got it
The only letters that might be difficult to pronounce for (non-English) learners are δ (/ð/) and θ (/θ/)
**Syntax wise:** there are minimum syntactic rules in Greek, due to the variety of forms a word can take
**Grammar wise:** have a damn good memory
Conjugations, tenses, moods, voices, word genders and exceptions for you to remember
But as someone else has stated; don't be afraid of speaking
Greeks are flattered, even if you just know one phrase
The accent is something similar to Spanish or Portuguese that's the only one I can think of
Spelling will be a nightmare so just know that
But reading and speaking is a breeze and we always appreciate when people try out our language even if you suck at it
So, learn the letters, then learn a few words and start speaking
We'll be happy to help you learn more
The reason reading and speaking will be easy:
* We only have 24 letters and you probably already know most of them from math/science class
* With only a couple of minor exceptions, each letter makes only 1 sound and ***always*** makes that exact sound
* Our vowel system is SUPER easy
All we have is the five "basic" vowels like in Spanish (i, e, a, o, u)
* Our consonant system is *fairly* easy but even if you struggle with some of them, no one will judge you and messing up the hard-ish ones **won't** make you hard to understand at all
* Greek always tells you which syllable is stressed in a word with more than one syllable so there's you'll never have any uncertainty about whether it's pronounced πότε and ποτέ.
Spelling is a nightmare largely because of 3000+ years of linguistic baggage:
* /e/ can be made with ε or αι
* /o/ can be made with ο or ω
* /i/ can be made in any of these 6 ways: ι, η, υ, ει, οι, υι.
I teach modern greek to foreigners
My best student only studied one year, and she said the thing that the thing that helped her the most was watching a tv series
She said it helped her more than the courses and the books
This is not how I learn, but it certainly helped her a lot
Try though I may I can't get the spelling conventions down
I never know which vowel to pronounce when there are two or more next to each other
I get that (usually) one is only there so you have "broad with broad and slender with slender" but how can I know which vowel to actually pronounce
Which of the four
I can easily say brød but I can't for the fucking life of me say hedder
It's the only word with that sound that I just can't get to sound right
I started with Danish
I live dangerously
Yeah all european countries celebrate the end of the war
Except us
We celebrate October 28th with military parades and patriotism, it's the day the Italians invaded, and most people don't even know when the celebration for the end of the war is
I wouldn't dare either
People would rather still use the drachma down here as well, but for *completely* different reasons lol
When you're going out: Take a jacket with you
When you're mad for a silly reason or when you don't agree with something : Drink vinegar
Wear a jacket, you'll catch a cold
Meanwhile it's 22°C
We say "were you born on a boat
Shoes with high heels aren't allowed at historic sites in Greece
Someone might find it weird although there's a good reason behind it
Mainly to prevent the destruction of the marbles you walk on and secondly to prevent you from injuring yourself, cause those ancient marbles are actually very slippery
"But I would look so much better on Instagram wearing high heals in front of the Acropolis"
If you get my point
I can but for many people it's extremely difficult to get everything right
The sound of "I" (as in "dig") can be written with 5 different ways for example
There have been answers about Greek already but I'll mention the opposite effect
In Greek you can always pronounce a word when you see it, down to the accent (or stress, whatever it's called)
Here's the thing; we write 11 vowels (α, ε, η, ι, ο, υ, ει, οι, υι, ω, ου) but only pronounce 5 (/α/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/) so when a word has an /e/ (ε or αι), an /o/ (ο or ω) or an /i/ (ι, η, υ, ει, οι or υι) sound you can't really predict the spelling, unless there's some certain rule to it (e.g feminine nouns end in -η)
Also, some words have double letters which are not pronounced as such
Άλλος sounds the same as if we'd say άλος.
Definately not
Since the Hellenistic times, η-υ-ι-οι-ει sound exactly the same but we still use them
Thus, when you hear bira ( beer ), some people write it with υ and some with ι = μπίρα - μπύρα.
You have the same problem most of the time with ο - ω and αι-ε.
In Greek letters only make one sound (with a few exceptions) and the spelling follows pretty predictable rules, so yes I can know how a word is spelled by hearing it
In English I can know how a word is spelled if it's used in a sentence based on context
If it's just one word and it's a homophone then you can't tell
I think yes
There are very few exceptions
Why would it be
If you replaced them with Vietnamese letters would you be confused
They just represent some variable
Not at all
It's easy for you to say that since it's your mother tongue, A in baba and a in Artekin is not the same though
A lot of people think so but for example, log() or sin() or even the common variables xyz are Latin and still people use them with no problem in maths
Don't know if it's poetic or not but usually in the army or old ppl call them καλλιοπες from the muse Calliope
Apparently this happened because somewhere the toilets were next to a statue of her and it just stuck
The place (το μέρος)
e.g. "I'm going to the place"
We call it
Καλλιόπη = Calliope
Like the 9th Muse, who presides over eloquence and epic poetry
It is an inspiring place to be fair
We say Χεστρα (shitter)
They used to have muse statues at omonoia square, that's where it comes from
Not to be confused with the three K's of white supremacy
Thanks that️
>Due to the existence of the underground railway it was necessary to create also an underground ventilation system and in 1931 Mayor of Athens Spiros Merkouris suggested placing eight sculptures representing the mythological Muses to cover the openings of the ventilation vents
Although the problem was solved, the result did not satisfy Athenians’ aesthetic expectations and the statues were removed
[Wasnt that bad] esp
if you compare with today IMO
It may not be my native language, but I've still forced way too many people to give "rød grød med fløde" a try
No regrets
I also like to make up Greek sentences with lots of δ [ð, **th**e] and θ [θ, **th**eme] just so I can hear someone without these sounds in their native language (e.g Germans) try to pronounce all of them in a row
This seems weird at first but really it's no different than "comfortable" in which the "or" is skipped (or just the "o" depending on your accent)
The Danish blødt d is represented in IPA by [ð̠ˠ]
The "ð" symbol means "voiced dental fricative" like in English **th**e (and lots of languages have it like that), the little line underneath it signifies it's "retracted", which means your tongue doesn't actually touch your teeth while saying it, and the little ˠ that's attached signifies it's "velarized", which means you use the back of your mouth a tiny bit more
I believe that the Spanish soft d is the exact same thing but without the velarization, just a [ð̠], however I've heard Basques pronounce it exactly like in Danish, which might be a dialectal thing
A basque singer, Izal, does that a lot noticeably in his songs
Also hi, we've interacted before lol
I've always wondered why the typical American pronunciation is perceived as the easier one
It's much easier, for example, to say "literally" in Received Pronunciation rather than in an american accent
Malakas: masturbator, person who masturbates (excessively)
• φίλε, φίλη (fíle, fíli) = friend
• αδερφέ (aderfé) = brother (this one's mostly for strangers that you're being nice to)
• κολλητέ/κολλητή (kollité/kollití) = this one's a bit old fashioned, kinda childish in a way, kinda r/fellowkids sometimes
It means "bestie"
• bro, but make it gender neutral (sis is rarely used)
• μαλάκα (maláka) = jerk, this one's strictly used on your friends, gender neutral (even though there's also μαλάκω)
• ρε (re) = this is a bit of a filler word, it basically means "you" and it's used in the Vocative case (when you're talking directly to someone) in informal situations, for example "Πού είσαι ρε μαλάκα?" which means "Where are you, you jerk
". It's gender neutral
• μωρή (morí) = exclusively feminine version of "re", less commonly used, a bit more aggressive sounding
Our Santa Claus lives in modern Turkey Kappadokia
Both of the saints that the Santa Claus figure was based on are from Asia Minor
Saint Nicholas for Catholics/Protestants etc and Saint Basil for the Orthodox
Yes, I should have pointed out that I was referring to the traditional interpretation of Santa Claus
Easter primarily
Always on Holy Saturday at midnight there's a vast cacophony of fireworks typically around churches
There is even a traditional "battle" using fireworks, called rouketopolemos (lit
rocket war) on the island of Chios, which has injured people/damaged properties over the years AFAIK
[Frankly, it looks fucking awesome, not to mention terrifying
On Easter on Resurrection Sunday
Well Sunday midnight
I think there was a skirmish with Bulgaria over a dog
Here's a few that pop on my mind:
1) One of the greatest Greek generals of the Greek war of independence Karaiskakis had some very memorable ones i) During a battle with the Ottomans, there was some resting time during the battle, so he went on a hill and he was showing his dick to the Ottomans, then someone shot him on the leg, but it wasn't anything
ii) An Ottoman Sultan sent him a letter asking him to surrender, so he responded "I asked my dick and he said no".
Iii) There was a trial on him and he was swearing all the time, so the judge tells him "You're 50 years old and you're swearing such, why don't you behave like your age
" and he responds "and you're 80,but you still fuck, don't you
2) There was a guy named Nikitaras, great warrior in the Greek war of independence, such great that in a battle, his sword stuck in his hand because his fingers were stuck and he couldn't move them
3)The dictator Papadopulos changed the divorce law for one night, so he could divorce his wife and marry his mistress
A lot of couples came the next day to take divorce, but they couldn't.
4) In 1967 the political situation was a huge mess, so there were 2 or 3 dictatorship coups that were being prepared
The Americans were supporting the king's coup and they were supervising the situation with American police etc and they expected him to do a coup during April
What no one knew is that there were 3 colonels preparing theirs
Eventually in the 21st of April, the tanks were parading in Athens
At the beginning, the US thought that it was the king, so they ignored them
But in the end, when the prime minister went to deliver the authority, the three colonels appeared and everyone were like " who the fuck are these guys
Yeah I believe a Greek Soldier's dog ran across the border and he chased after it
We've had a lot of people assassinated but I'm not aware anything like that
> Winston Churchill wrote, "it is perhaps no exaggeration to remark that a quarter of a million persons died of this monkey's bite
It was VERY unfortunate event indeed
Greece has the largest merchant fleet in the world
About 16,5%.
Greece is the most sexually active country in the world
(not sure how factual that is but I heard it in the past and a quick Google search agreed)
Constantine Kanaris tried, but failed to destroy the Egyptian fleet BY SAILING TO ALEXANDRIA AND FIRING AT THE PORT
Crazy guy this one
Also, a lot of people seem to be, whether willingly or not is a mystery to me, of the history and contribution of the Greeks during the middle ages until the 19th century
For example Capodistrias role in creating the Swiss federal state structure
>Only 15 % of the members of the Church of Sweden believe in Jesus
Wait what
How are they Christians if they don't believe in Jesus
Because
49,99€
looks way more appealing than
50€
in case you want to buy something
Yes it's pretty much the same over here
Usually only supermarkets give 1c, 2c and 5c change if you pay cash
Which makes you wish they hadn't cause your pocket fills up with useless coins
In Greece we don't have boy scouts
You go straight to the military
dude we have scouts in greece and are kinda similar to op's example, i was a scout when in middle school, obviously not as much nature trips in athens but many fun activities
Really
Then we have a really bad marketing
There are plenty of roman ruins all over Greece, the most notable being the Roman Forum, the Arch of Galerius and the Rotunda in Thessaloniki, the Roman city of Nicopolis, which is the largest archeological site of a city in Greece, the Library and Arch of Hadrian and the Odeon of Herodus Atticus in Athens, a theatre just below the Parthenon
There are also various segments of Via Egnatia the roman road that crossed the modern-day Northern Greece
Well not many early Roman ones but the Other day I went to a monastery built sometimes between 1000 and 1200 in Eastern Rome (aka Byzantium)
The forum isn't a unique structure in Rome
The fora were squares/marketplaces that were present in all large roman cities
I also forgot to mention the existence of the Roman forum in Athens but it's not so well preserved
Other fora can be found all across Europe and Near East
Trashy club music, but goddamn I love both of these
The version by Betontod has been stuck in my head since it came out in 2018
>[Dschinghis Khan - Dschinghis Khan (1979)]
*^(Moskau, Moskau, wirf die Gläser an die Wand, Russland ist ein schönes Land
*^(Not the same song, but it started playing in my head)*
There is literally a very popular Greek bootleg of this with the same exact music, but I have no idea what it's called
Σαν τη Χαλκιδική δεν έχει (=There is no place like Chalkidiki, a town/county with very nice beaches and very nice to be in all around)
We are drivers with bad manners
Everyone agrees noone changes
Everyone agrees that our politicians be they right, left or center, are corrupt to the core
Its also weird how everyone is aware and yet we fight endlessly for the most trivial political issues
Yes
People who say that about Chalkidiki have probably never visited Lefkada or Kefalonia imo
[There] you go, some burek Reddit wisdom for you
Personally I like my own town's beaches best (Kalamata)
But Chalkidiki has a special place in my heart
I like the islands but I'm more into mainland scenery tbh
Well, we do almost the same with meat and call it a souvlaki so I can't really express my confusion about it
still weird though
So there are places like Chalkidiki after all
Kalamata is not like Chalkidiki, I just like it
You put banana (among other weird things) on your pizza, everything else are just simple misdemeanors tbh LOL
Yeah we have those too usualy with pepper, onions, tomato etc
but you will never see mixed meats
As I said before, we call them souvlaki and together with Gyros pita they're our national food
I actually ask my neighbors to receive a package for me ,so yeah I find it so weird .
Also if you are not there or if the package does not fit the mailbox (which it's most times as we usually don't have the USA style) , the post man leaves a notice for you to pick it up from the office
No, they don't leave the packages on our doorstep here
If you chose to have it delivered and not picked up at a pickup point, they come to your house and ring your bell, if nobody shows up then they leave with the package and try calling you again to arrange another delivery date some other time
Half the big/medium cities of Germany
The general climate you get is that the whole point is to get from point A to point B to point C.
It's not a letter per se, it's more of where you put the "tonus", aka the emphasis of the word:
Μαλάκια (malákia) = Clams
Μαλακία (malakía) = Bullshit
and
Μαλακά (malaká) = Softly
Μαλάκα (maláka) = Wanker/Asshole (/friend, when you don't try to insult your friends)
Τρώω παϊδάκια. (rough pronunciation: troo paidakia, the o's in troo are like one prolonged "oh")
Τρώω παιδάκια. (rough pronunciation: troo pedakia)
The first one means "I'm eating lamb chops"
The other one though is brutal
"I'm eating kids"
There's a difference between ι and ΐ so be careful
You don't wanna be saying that you're eating kids
Even better in greek, we have 2 words that are exactly the same but have to be emphasised in a different spot
Mal(a')ka \[Μαλάκα\] and Malak(a') \[Μαλακά\]
one means softly, and the other means asshole
That's nothing
The tonus that I mentioned, also has completely different meanings depending on the situation you use it
τόνος = putting emphasis on something
τόνος = ton (weight unit)
τόνος = tuna
τόνος = tone
I paid 0 euros for my degree and I got 52 books for free (one per course)
In Greece universities are free, which in addition to the low prices here, make a good country to study
In Greece we have a system we call the "panhellenics" Where students write exams and try to reach the points each university/school/academy requires for you to get in
(If I'm not mistaken all are free)
Im pretty sure you choose 4 subjects to write idk I'm not sure I'm going to be giving those Exams next year
Greece has free universities, but I don't know what goes for non-EU students
Cost of life is also relatively low, though from what I understand the language can be pretty hard to learn

I love it when I stop thinking about a thunderstorm's immediate effects such the lightning and thunder as something distant, and instead think of a thunderstorm as the violently energetic natural phenomenon that it is
A lot of us are used to being sequestered in our homes safely away from all of it, but I find thunderstorms oddly primal and exhilarating at times
Objectively, it sucks having to move through one if you have to
Subjectively, if the day affords you the luxury of observation, it really is this awesome display of elemental power that fills your eyes, your ears, rattles your body and reminds you of the unstoppable, ever-advancing earthly processes that go on, and will go on in spite of you
yeah, that
They're cool
This one's a bit different but the word where "poet" comes from, "ποιητής", means "the one who creates" and "ποίημα" (poem) means "creation"
"Rhino" in English comes from Greek "Rhinoceros" which means nose horn as well lol
Γειά, το όνομά μου είναι Γιάννης. Χαίρομαι που σας γνωρίζω. Από που είστε;

Hi, me they call John
I was happy for the acquaintance
From where are you
Καλησπέρα! Το όνομά μου είναι Δημήτρης και είμαι από την Ελλάδα. Ζω στη Θεσσαλονίκη εδώ και 10 χρόνια. Είμαι 17 χρονών, και πηγαίνω τρίτη Λυκείου.
Good-evening
The name my is Dimitris and am from the Greece
Live in the Thessaloniki here and 10 years
Am of 18 years, and go third of Lyceum
Good evening
My name is Dimitris and I am from Greece
I have been living in Thessaloniki for 10 years
I am 18 years old, and I'm in the third grade of Lyceum
lol we also have this here but with balls "You've broken my balls"
But you didn't have wolves for a long time too right
Although I agree wolves are pretty harmless to humans
Pretty interesting, how many are there now
And if they roam outside the protected zones can they just be hunted
this is what always cracks me up from my time in the army: I served as a conscript and the training camp was a huge area and we were around 1500 conscripts
around 40-50 of us (not me) had a weed habit
things were pretty loose during the first days so no punishments involved
outside our quarters there was a small forest  and we had the afternoons off so we just hang out until night call
in the first few days we could see a bunch of guys walking into the forest and come back after an hour or so with a goofy smile on their faces
soon more and more were walking into the trees to come back with goofy smiles
one day we see our commander hopping into a jeep and drive fast in the forest
ten minutes later we could hear a rumble coming out of the woods and moments later we see dozens of guys running in all directions like animals trying to escape a wildfire
it was effing hilarious
>Nobody fought the Turks in the mountains
Austria and Turkey were on the same side in WW1 surely
lol in Greece everyone gets fatter in the army cause they order delivery food every day
Yeah I remember seeing some turkish loot in the museum in Vienna (or was it Budapest)
Oh believe me I know ;) We were part of it for 500 years
I don't think that anyone cares about that
I never saw an EU flag outside of photos or television
I think almost all places (public property) where the Hellenic flag is flown so is the EU flag
my neighborhood's school
Don't live close to any one of those
I don't even know if there are any in my city
Hmm, there might be one there but I don't think I have ever noticed it
"Dogtooth" maybe you've already seen it cause it's from Yorgos Lanthimos but if you haven't that would be my recommendation
"The lobster" and "voyage to Cythera" for Greece
I highly recommend the latter
Έτερος Εγώ (The Other Me)
It's an amazing crime thriller, and, in my opinion, Greece's best production so far
AKA "Plato's cave in the Greek suburbia with incest"
Ibiza and Majorca
Like we do every year
Also European women raiding Mount Athos would be fun to watch
Bielefeld doesn't exist ;p
so that we BECOME the aliens
smart
Yes, they actually have
But you know what they say "there is no force equal to that of a determined woman", not to mention thousands of them
There are over 1,000 monasteries in Greece that do the same thing for both men and women
You will have quite some raiding to do
They are both private property
If you bought all the land, yea you could, just as plenty of people own entire islands
You never actually own land though, the state does
I would gladly exchange Angela Merkel for Sanna Marin
I didn't know you were ruled by Hydra
• You can rearrange the words in a sentence any way you want and it will still be grammatically correct
• Unless the subject of a sentence has not be mentioned and is not known, you can skip it entirely and you will still be perfectly understood
The best way, actually, to emphasise who did something in a sentence is to include the subject in it, when it is not needed
• Cussing feels so satisfying (compared to english at least) for 3 main reasons
1) the harder pronunciation of various letters (b, t, d, r, k etc
) makes cuss words sound better by default
2) There are so many words for about the same thing (παπάρα-papara, μαλάκα-malaka, καριόλη-karyoli, μουνόπανο-munopano all essentially mean asshole)
3) You can use any cuss word/phrase in any situation and it will most likely be valid
BONUS: you can say "I fuck your
" and put anything you want afterwards and it will make sense (mother, house, kin, siblings, fridge, carpet, shed, ceiling etc
I love that Greek is a very rich and descriptive language
There is a word to describe any feeling or idea
I'm assuming this is the case for many languages, but since my second language is English, that's what I have to compare it with
(Not hating on English btw, there is a reason it is the global language)
The fact that knowing it, adds a whole new layer of meaning to many universally known English words
For example, Telescope comes from greek Tele (Far) and Scope (Observe)
Even though I've been speaking Greek for 20ish years, it still fascinates me to learn stuff like this
Just out of curiosity, to what extend can you understand each other's dialects
I guess maybe [κοκορέτσι (kokorétsi)] which is the internal organs of a sheep or goat put on a spit with oil and spices, wrapped in the intestine, and grilled over a fire until everything gets crispy
There's nothing particularly gross about it at all, but if eating internal organs is gross to you, then I guess it would be gross
I guess magiritsa (μαγειρίτσα) a soup made with lamb offal and -at least in my area- lettuce inside
We only make it once a year at the end of the Holy Week
On the other hand I've had haggis and its taste  reminded me of magiritsa
So I guess at least some people abroad would like magiritsa too
We also eat a lot of octopus (it's relatively expensive though)
Apparently many foreigners feel disgusted till they try it (charcoal grilled is my favorite, but octupus in vinegar is great too) . But they act the same about squid too
I personally just dislike tripe soup although my dad loves it so I have bad memories of that soup smelling in thw whole house, yikes
Many Greeks have tripe soup as a hangover remedy
Probably because it's so strong it wakes you up
Luckily I'm one of the few that never get hangovers
Kokoretsi, it consists of  lamb or goat intestines wrapped around seasoned organ meat
This includes pancreases, hearts, lungs, kidneys, and is grilled
Many people in Greece love to eat it, especially at Easter
ΠΑΤΣΑ!!!! Also why did you have to say grilled  octopus, now I want some
Magiritsa is fucking **delicious** tho
Lol that's so dumb
Didn't the Turkish public notice the Greeks were still eating it
It's on my mind for days now  the weather is so nice, we were suppose to cebrate my daughter's birthday on the seaside in a taverna, it was her birthday wish
I absolutely agree
This year though it doesn't feel like easter at all
At the supermarkets in my town you have to make an order for lamb related stuff by the end of this week
It will get crazy
We're still thinking if we should have easter simulation or not
It's just not the same
We use it quite often
It has integrated into the greek vocabulary
It even has it's own greek version: Oκ/Οκέι
very common
everyday use and probably a part of the Greek language now
It's common, but we tend to use εντάξει (εν τάξει/in order) more, I think
Basically all the time
It feels way too formal to say "entáxei" at this point
"Politicians"
1919 war
1922 defeat
1925 dictatorship
1932 bankruptcy
1936 dictatorship
1940 war
1941 defeat and occupation
1946 civil war
1967 dictatorship
1974 war and defeat
2009-19 crisis
Other than this misery, the major difference in Greece between 1919 and 2019 is the population
The minorities were wiped out and Greek refugees from Turkey as well as economic immigrants from the Balkans took their place
He would have been familiar with the concept
I find Malta fascinating
Not just for the Knights of Malta but for the people themselves, hardcore Catholics who speak a Semitic langauge with elements of Arabic, Italian, French and English
A profundity of surnames mixing those languages, rather than a 'cohesive' surname logic
Part of Britain until 1964 (even though they voted to remain part of the UK), geographically African, but politically European
Only legalised divorce a few years ago
Live in a country with no rivers or lakes and almost entirely flat, yet somehow they've survived and prosopered
Was so overpopulated that their govenrnment has encouraged EMIGRATION for most of their history
One of the weirder European stories I read recently was that Hitler promised the Cossacks a 'homeland' in Friuli if they fought for him against Stalin
In the early 1940s, thousands of Cossacks arrived in Carnia (northern Friuli) and began clearing it of the native population and establishing Russian-speaking Cossack towns
When Friuli was liberated, they went to Austria but were captured by the British and sent to the USSR, where they were killed by Stalin
[Stavros Niarchos Foundation cultural centre] is one of the newest buildings in Athens
It was funded by the Stavros niarhos foundation o wealthy greek ship owner
It hosts a lot of events like concerts, movie nights most of them free to the public
The new national library is placed there, as well the national opera house
You can find more about it [here]
&#x200B;
Edit: The photo is still from the construction phase
[Here] is an aerial view of the structure
Yes, this
Which is the view from my balcony
We have an island called  [Ρω]  (Ro)
Not certain but probably
Κώς(Kós) island which is one syllable
The translator of the first book of Harry Potter (didn't translate the rest but set a precedent with her choices, that were followed in the rest of the series, as well as in the subtitling of the movies) changed Tom Marvolo Riddle to Anton Morvol Hert and made a mess that didn't even make sense; the anagram was derived from Lord Voldemort and was actually wrong, since she used two ω and not one ο (they sound the same at greek) even though Βόλντεμορτ (Voldemort) has an o.
It has nothing to do with "my culture" or "European culture" it's the same to me as if something like that happened to the statue of Jesus of Nazareth in Rio or if like the Pyramids got destroyed etc
It's human culture and heritage being lost
Horrible to see
I am shocked and of course it's pretty devastating
Notre dame is a major cultural part of France, more so than the Eiffel tower
To top it, it's one of the most recognizable European buildings, on a world level
France, hung in the there ️
If someone talks to you and you don't talk back alot of people (especially older people) will think you are deranged
Ever hear the phrase the silent ones are the ones you need to look out for
The belief is lack of emotion and expression (only for men) = potentially dangerous
"I'm not going to say what I'm going to do" is like saying you are going to bomb them, everyone usually says a lie of what they are going to do even though most of the time they don't do anything
Based off that fake answer/emotion people can tell how you will actually react and that answer is never enough to actually do any harm to you or them
If that makes sense
I give a slight honk every time someonen forget to drive  when a traffic light turns to green
Face to face discussion sucks
I'm all for passive aggressive letters
People honking in traffic grinds my gears so badly, ^WHAT ^THE ^FUCK ^ARE ^WE ^SUPPOSED ^TO ^DO
Am half greek / half english, one of the silent ones
I never really understood this disingenuous talking shit and in the end doing nothing mentality
Its like the whole population is trying to seem like something they aren't, and even though everyone is aware of it, because everyone does it, people keep on doing it
Never made sense to me
Seems like too much extra work
Just say what you actually plan to do, makes things easier for everyone involved
Now realizing I've probably hurt a few people when I actually did what I said I would do
Oh well
I haven't noticed differences in specific aspects of mine when I'm speaking English compared to when I'm speaking Greek, but there's a pretty obvious overall change, it almost feels like I'm a completely different person when I'm talking to people who don't speak Greek
We don't dislike Athens as far as I'm aware
There's a bit of rivalry with Thessaloniki and people in the country sometimes get annoyed by Athenians when they visit because they don't know anything about living in the country, but that's it
I don't think Athens is disliked in Greece in general
I really really like Athens personally
Many greeks shit on Athens but imo it's literally the heart and pulse of the country
Damn dude, this is us too
Yes and a pretty one actually
The "[Koskotas Scandal] was and still is a big scandal
Im honestly pretty sure most of our governments crumble before tje end of their term, nowadays at least
In Greece, mainly due to the size of our tourism industry, the rise of the internet and also the need to live abroad caused by the unemployment rates, a lot of younger people can speak at least another language (predominantly English) to some extent
So, it isn't a particularly noteworthy skill, although having a high degree of competence is a differentiating factor
It's widely considered as a must-do thing here as a lot of young people travel abroad to make a living and sometimes come back to have a comfortable life here
My sister moved to Germany last year actually
In Greece learning English is a thing for years now and most of us are fluent with a slightly accent
A lot of people around 11 years old are starting learning German or French
It's not expected of older people but when ⅓ of your economy revolves around tourism, chances are you will be able to hold a basic conversation with the majority
I'll go for 2 people, because they go as a pair
Bogdanos and A. Georgiadis
Their IQ combined is lower even than their shoe size
George Soros would be my first choice
But him alone isn't enough, I have plenty more
I can't decide if I want to ban Tsipras or Erdogan
Isn't that the surname of that serial killer also
One more reason I guess
Um, we are living proof that it actually can ..
You can have him for free
I don't think we have any such laws
BUT
Our priests may not proceed to baptize a child, if they don't have a "Christian" name
For the past five year it has become fashionable, to name your child an ancient Greek name,like Orestes or Electra
But most of the time you have to also use a name from an orthodox Saint, like Mary or Constantine
Hence, many children nowadays have two or even three names
I work with the programs used for the name registry
There are no official limitations
Foreign names are spelled in Greek so if someone wants to be called William (Γουίλλιαμ), his name with Latin characters would be Gouilliam unless the person can prove that a foreign legal entity refers to him with a different name
In that case the ID or passport would write "Gouilliam or William" (same for last names)
Apart from that, we discourage Greek born parents from the non official variants of the names
A person called Giannis is always registered as Ioannis, Vasilis as Vasileios, Thanasis as Athanasios etc
If a parent chooses to give the name with a baptism, which is about 90% of the cases, the priest registers the name which is always a Christian name or an ancient Greek name (although I know of some exceptions where priests became "creative". Until that point, in all public documents the child uses the name AKO (without first name)
Up to 1950s two or more names were not used, so a new name was used being a combination of other names eg: Charalamposotirios (Charalampos + Sotirios)
Also fun fact: we don't have any middle names
Instead we use our father's and mother's name, which is also written in our IDs
A Cypriot friend of mine (Panayiotis) told me he knew a Cypriot man whose nickname was "Navos".  "Navos" as in short for "Ναβουχοδονόσορ" (Nebuchadnezzar)
Not even kidding
Andreas Andreou son of Andrea Andreou and Andriana Andreou would like a word :p
There is no length limit that I have encountered
Up to 3 names are allowed and 2 last names but I have seen some fields having more than one name, thus cheating the system
We always use the ELOT standard, we don't have the option of doing otherwise (I don't like it either, ancient transliteration eg Athanasius is better)
I don't think Cyprus uses ELOT , I am only seeing Panayiotis with y.
I was discussing with some Cypriot friends about that in Easter and I was shocked
Everybody in Greece is really familiar with Γεώργιος, Αθανάσιος, Μιχαήλ etc
When someone calls and says his name is Θάνος I always search for Αθανάσιος. I think our system is better as there is a standard
If you're official name is Αθανάσιος, you can be called Θάνος, Θανάσης etc while if you are eg registered as Θάνος, you're always a Θάνος.
Also it is part of the culture
When your mother is angry and calling you, she won't be like Lefteri come here but: Eleftherie
It's pretty mainstream, but probably the Acropolis Museum in Athens honestly
Definitely the best in Stockholm (that I've visited
My girlfriend loves Stockholm's modern art museum, but I haven't been there)
I also really liked the Gustavianum in Uppsala
Can't pick a favorite
That's gay
My parents are Greeks of Pontic descent, and as a result are fluent in Russian (their families first fled into the USSR before going to Greece)
Thus when they want to complain between themselves about their children they start talking Russian lmao
Most often parents will know less languages than their children so no
We do use fancy vocabulary though for that
Depending on their level, I either encourage or discourage it
If someone can keep a conversation, I try to make them feel comfortable and speak accordingly
If they can't, I try to seemlessly switch to English
When it comes to correcting mistakes, I try to see how receptive they are of comments
Personally, when speaking Spanish for example, I love people correcting me because this way I will never make the same mistake again
Not all people see it this way though and we have to respect it
When it comes to helping them in other ways, I think we, Greeks, are really hospitable either way so it doesn't make a difference
Greece
Absolutely not annoyed, we are actually very happy when people try to speak greek
Sometimes it does, and I'll generally appreciate the effort considering how difficult Greek is when you don't grow up speaking it
But please, avoid stereotypes, it's just annoying
no not at all most people will actually appreciate it, but be carefull cause some pricks will try to teach you swearwords for example [this poor man] he thinks he is simply greeting people in Greek while he is actually saying "HELLO YOU WANKER (a bad word commonly used by close friends), HOW HAVE YOU BEEN YOU TESTICLE, PUSSYDOG" this video went viral in Greece and i feel very bad for this man who obviously doesn't know what he is saying
My experience in France taught me that it's best to start by asking in french if they speak English
Like you said, if you ask in English directly, they might not understand
Also, when i just asked what i wanted in french, everyone assumed i understood french well enough and spoke glouglouglou super fast, which left me looking at them like an idiot
So I'd always ask if they speak English, and jf they said no, I'd speak some french and they'd reply using simple slow words so that i could understand
Grill smells, particularly souvlaki/ gyros/ ribs smells, oregano, thymian and parsley, fish, sea salt smells, CO2/pollution smell
Also a mountainous, snowy smell for Northern Greece
*WAIT* How could I forget about our great olive oil and olives
And Feta cheese/ different cheeses we have that have this spicy taste and smell to them
Edit: added some smells :)
I was looking for the Greek comment haha
I would add mountain tea (τσάι του βουνού) but I think oregano is definitely the most characteristic smell of Greece :)
Was looking for it too
didn't found any, so I decided to make the difference xD
That's true I forgot about our great and mighty mountain tea hahah
Hahaha I wish I could disagree with you but if I had to pick the smell of Athens during the summer it wouldn’t be too far off :(
That's true sadly hahahah
Interesting
I would associate Italy with tomato or olive oil
But I do agree that we love thyme
What's it like living somewhere where the population is rapidly decreasing
Country, region, city, town, village
you choose
A fucking nightmare knowing that your nation's time is running out
I think all around Europe people abandon countryside moving to cities
Here it's even worse; apart from the two biggest cities (Athens, Thessaloniki) and some tourist places, population is massively shrinking
Mainly through migration towards better-managed European countries (UK, Netherlands, Germany) or US
With the current ratio Greece should be a circa 8 million country in less than 15 years, with a population comprising of mainly aged Greeks and immigrants
Yes but only the strains that do not smell bad like the vaping ones
One of the common types of cannabis can be smelled really far away because it has almost the exact same chemical components of a skunk spray
That is why those smell like skunk
Those strains should all be banned, all the rest legal
The Greeks taste like olives with a bap of pine
The Swiss taste like brie cheese
The English taste like grumpiness
The French taste like fermented grapes and body sweat
And the Germans taste different depending on the part of the country
East Germans taste a little bitter, west Germans vary a lot
The Bavarians taste more like Austrians and are very rich in flavor bc of the nitrites
And the northerners taste a little more bland but have a nice refined texture
Those are the only nationalities I've eaten so far
Trying to go for all 193 countries by the time I die
Or get caught
As a kid I thought England was another way to say UK
I used to think that because of Kaliningrad there were two dinstict countries named Russia 'cause I did not understand the concept of exclaves
When i was kid i thought most Russian women had red hair
Not ginger
Pure red
I don't know why
Shut up you egg
I first encountered the word Prussia in a joke
"Prussia is 3,14 times bigger than Russia" cause ρωσία - πρωσία lol
London, Rome, Lisbon, Istanbul, Budapest would be my go to
There should be an interesting story why adding a character that is not really needed is considered useful in your part of the world
Loumidis & Bravo for Greek coffee, Jacobs for instant(hot as well as frapé) and drip coffee, Illy for anything espresso-based (includes freddo greco)
Have you ever dated a person from a different country
What was that like
What did you enjoy most about the relationship
I dated a person from Finland for two years
I enjoyed being able to see the world through someone that grew up in a country so different from mine (weather, food, customs, views on life in general and what’s important)
I think for most people who live in tourist areas, yes, the best part was not having to verbally communicate as much because we both literally couldn't. Good for some, frustrating for some
Ahahaha λατρεύω το username σου!!
In Greek, we have the letter gamma (γ)
For some letter combinations, the sound of this letter does not exist in other languages (it is softer than the g sound in English)
Many foreigners (especially Germans) confuse it with the guturral r.
Once my girlfriend wanted to say "Αγάπη μου" (agápi mu/my love) but instead she said "Aράπη μου" (arápi mu)
This means my negro
I don't think it counts
But there was a viral video of an African tourist that was very enthusiastic about the Greek language and someone taught him some curse words having him think it was something else
In the [video] he goes:
"Γεια σου ρε μαλακα, που'σαι ρε αρχιδι, μουνοσκυλο"
Which means "Hello maláka, where are you(how are you) you testicle, pussydog"
And then proceeded to count in Greek, It's very funny but I feel bad as he was really enthusiastic about the Greek language
Haha, this happens when we write Spanish assignments on the computer
People type things like "cuando tenia 6 anos" and I wonder how the teacher never laughs
It’s the sound in this [video]
I actually didn't realise how foreign this generation thing was to me until I read this question
I've never talked about generations outside of Reddit and other online websites
If I brought it up to a non Anglophone Greek he would probably think I'm a lunatic
Age gaps do obviously exist
It's just that we don't socially categorize people based on their birthyear the way Americans do
That's not even close
In the US it extends beyond politics
Η γενιά του Πολυτεχνείου;
there is an abandoned mansion about 20 minutes drive from where I live
The urban legend  says that the mansion is haunted
[a news story in greek]
There is this Daveli cave (or cave of Penteli) which is said to have demons and stuff in it
It used to be a Byzantine monastery but now abandoned
How are jail conditions in Ireland
Are the inmates there dangerous and stuff
Right at the centre, under the big arch right
Half face is the stone and tge other half is the reflection in the water
Not British, but the equivalent of the word fuck in greece sounds way more serious yet you can hear it almost everywhere, yet there are a lot of greek words for fuck you and each is more serious than the last one  and can easily start a fight no matter how it is used
*Greek Cursing 101*
Omicron on its own means "the" (masculine), eta on its own also means "the" (feminine), unless you put an accent, then it means "or".
ο, which means "the" (singular masculine)
η (i), which means "the" (singular feminine)
ή (í), which means "or"
ου (u), which means "not" in ancient Greek (it counts as one letter cause it's a single phthong)
ο (masculine 'the')
η (feminine 'the')
α, ε and ω can be used as interjections
Beautiful
I was telling my friend how island in Danish is "ø" and his mind was blown
"Isn't that just a letter though
You've seen nothing, my dude
Yeah that's what I said
ο,τι is a pronoun and means 'whatever'
οτι is a conjunction and it means 'that'
They both sound the same and many people incorrectly use οτι for both cases
It's almost never brought up, but when it does, it's not considered rude
Most people can figure out your wage if you just tell them your job, your experience and your family status
>!It's almost always between the minimum wage and two times that, plus the children bonuses
We have the king of olives my friends, Kalamata olives
So, black are more popular
I prefer the green ones usually stuffed with almonds
Black olives need to be a certain way to taste nice for me
I was gonna say black olives and then I saw that you said Greece is associated with green ones
We have a lot of both of them, I guess
Damn right
Even shitty Kalamata olives are good
I was saying the opposite though, haha
They are considered black, but to me honest, in Greece we just refer to them as Kalamata olives, as we do for other types of olives, we reffer to them by name, we never say "black olives".
Yes they taste great and I think due to the brine the almond holds most of its crunchiness
[stuffed olives with almond or peppers ]
We also have those with the peppers but not with anchovies , I think .
Sadly, not really
Especially young children that would go out by themselves in other countries, like 9-10 year olds, don't go alone to school but rather by schoolbus (private schools) or the parent drives them there
We aren't that independent here from a young age :(
It depends if the school is in the city you have to walk but in my case where it was in the middle of nowhere we had some cheap buses take us
And don't think about the typical yellow school bus it was a regular bus that had a few problems
kindergarten and first couple of years of elementary with an adult/ older child
after that either alone or with other kids/ guys
Ancient Greek(stone tablets, scrolls, vases etc)I can read but I understand only a few words, maybe a sentence max
Many are common or similar with modern Greek but feels like a different language really
Texts after 300 bc or so are a bit easier to understand because a simplified, more related to modern Greek language is used
I can understand maybe a few sentences
It gets easier as we move to present day
Medieval text are easier still to understand at least get a general idea
In Greece we learn a lot of Ancient Greek in school, but there's so many forms of the language that most people don't understand everything
There's classical Greek, church Greek, Byzantine Greek, etc
I'll piggy back on yours since it's about Greek
- 1900s. In the 20th century the official language and written language was different than the spoken, heavily borrowed from ancient, so for me as a young person can have a few hick ups etc
- 1300s. Then with older stuff it really really depends on the text
Medieval Greek has no gaps, very stylised and has abbreviations so you need a lot of context
But I can understand a fair bit if its rewritten with gaps and proper font
- 100s Common (koine) Greek of Roman period I can understand fairly well at times, I've tried to read parts of the Bible in it
But it might be because I have a lot of context and know the phrasing used in the Bible but many similar words and grammar non the less
- 400bc
Earlier than that I get lost easily, like Attic Greek I can't understand, I can read and pick words and grammar but not general meaning easily at all
- 700bc Homeric Greek, same as above but no chance at general meaning I can't understand
- 1500bc
Mycenaean Greek, doesn't even use an alphabet
Ah the fonts
“Oh look some pretty text” when you look it from afar, makes you head explode when you try to read it
Greeks generally speak decent English, but a relatively common mistake is not knowing when to use "say" and "tell" as there is only one word for these two in Greek
So you can hear stuff like "Say me, what happened yesterday"
They usually use the definite article (the) for no reason even before names because it’s like that in greek
saying "sorry" instead of "excuse me" because they are the same word in greek
It's just a piece of paper covered in plastic
They've been trying to switch to a digital version since forever because the current design screams "forgery". Many people are afraid of the new format and think it's the "mark of the devil" or something, I've even heard the church discouraging people from getting a new digital ID card once it's required
It's so funny when you think of it
You're supposed to renew it every 15 years but no one does and I've seen 40-year-old ID cards used with no issues
The greek one doesn't even look like an ID card
Whenever I am in Europe people give me a side look, they can't believe that it's an official document lol
Especially, when it doesn't have an expiration date
I have mine since 2009 lol
[Here] you can see how it's looks .
It's light blue, on the front you have a picture that is has to have a Greek stamp covering a part of it, your nationality, your signature and the signature of the officer that made it next which municipality's police department made it
On the back you have your name, your dads and moms name, date of birth, place of birth and height both in Greek and Latin letters
There might be more I'll update this once I get home and have mine
I'm more exasperated with young people that don't want to change their ID card due to fingerprint or that the government will make a file of them etc, than old people who don't understand .
I prefer when going abroad and being asked for an ID due to my baby-face , to be able to show something they will believe is legit .
Now what the Church or some priests think
Whatever .
Also the current one includes
Name -Surname ,dad's name- surname , moms name , DOB , Height , where you live and which police department issued the ID
The new one is supposed to have far more information that will follow the Estonian model .
It's about time we switched from being stuck in the 1950s, but it is bold to assume that our gov couldn't screw it up somehow
We are supposed to switch as well, but people fear of it being "the devil's sign" due to them including the finger print, or something like that
Clowns
Not wrong per se
I meant the technological model that your IDs use as it's very advanced . They will used it as a base and include all kind of different information that will help with making online transactions with government agencies easier
isn't that kinda the point of the government
how do they think they can get married or be taxed without a file
-->And yeah , that's what I think too
1600 - no data
1700 - no data
1800- Bursa (Prussa)
1900 - Izmir (Smyrne)
2000 - Athens
2100 - Athens so far
For first centuries of Ottoman rule that no official data exist, sources mention Ioannina, Patras, Rhodes and Heraklion but probably that has to do with the fact they were the last Greek cities to fall
Don't wanna be that guy, but Monastir actually comes from Greek originally
It means monastery
Was there like a big monastery in the past
To be fair it's not like the two events are not related
Making it the capital draws people
Same way Athens went from small town to 1/3+ of the Greek population in less than two centuries when it was designated as the capital of the new Greek Kingdom
Oh alright TIL, again
Learning on Reddit is never ending surprisingly :)
My first encounter with English was when I was 7 or 8 years old, when My brother bought an Amstrad computer
All games and software were in English of course and because It didn’t had any ui, you had to type everything
This helped me memorize a lot of words
My first computer was an Amiga and although the documentation was in Greek, the ui was in English
Having the manuals in my native language and the os in English actually helped a lot to understand the basics of the language
After that I kept all my later computers and devices in English even today
My big breakthrough was while playing word of Warcraft thought as I had to type to communicate with my teammates
Movies were also a great help, since everything in Greece is subtitled
I can understand English just as well as my native language, but I never practiced speaking or writing just as I would like to
As I grow older I start to forget rules and syntax and a result it becomes more difficult for me to speak and write
I started at age 5, after I requested it from my parents
They were wise enough to choose native speakers as my teachers
From then on, exposure to movies, TV shows and the internet are more or less enough to maintain the near-native level I am happy to say I have achieved
They tried to teach us some basic English at kindergarten but honestly the reason I could read English from an early age was Yugioh . Me and my cousin were playing all the time and since we were very competitive I had to learn to read the cards ..
I think we had  English classes since first grade
The Harry Potter books are also a catalyst
My parents refused to buy me the books (bacause magic=Satan and other BS) but I was determined to read them so I not-very-legally-downloaded them when I was 13 I think
I was going in an English school but I learned English from video games, music and English news sources
I started when I was about 9
I learned pretty quick because I wanted to understand videogames, tv shows and browse the internet
At 13 I was watching full movies without subtitles in my language and reading English books
I once flew from Greece to Finland but my flight was delayed so I started speaking to another girl who was also Greek
She was a photography student and went to study in Oulu, Finland I believe
It was the winter semester so I’m sure it was cold but I followed her on social media and her pictures were gorgeous, so I’m sure it must have been a fun experience :)
Greece in general
While a big number of Greeks are participating in foreign Erasmus programs we rarely get foreign ones in the Greek universities
Poland during winter
I seriously canàt understand why it attracts so many Erasmus students
It’s quite funny because Greeks aren’t used to cold weather at all
We wear coats in the winter but even without one you’ll be a little chilly and that’s OK
I do remember going back to Finland a different year at the beginning of August and I had to buy myself a leather jacket because it was rainy and chilly most days haha
But now that I live in the Midwest in the US and I compare the temperature between Helsinki and Chicago often during the heavy winter, I would pick Finland in a heartbeat
Very few English-speaking courses and learning greek is out of the question, so
The chances of someone learning the two languages are quite similar tho
When someone is being loud I immediately assume they're American
Sometimes, there are certain styles you only see in certain countries and certain faces you only see there too but 50% of the time you will probably be wrong
Sometimes but not really
There's the obvious Western/Eastern and bigger Northern Southern divides but they can mix a bit
Coming from Greece you can take a guess with Slavic peoples from the haircut, body type, facial structure, cross necklace and clothes
Albanians can be distinguished sometimes if they are workers or something, more likely to be short and stocky with a rougher face and different clothes than Greeks, but can't really distinguish second generation Albanians in Greece
And Caucasus people like Armenians and Georgians I've only met a very few but they have different face structure all together I think, big square jaw, thicker eyebrows, bone at eyebrow region comes out more, different hairline
British people are also kinda distinguished
I think most ppl need more background experience to be able to potentially at times make a guess other than the general ones
I wonder what gives away Greek people
Sit on *your* eggs : Mind your own business
Go see if the boats are moving : Stop annoying me and go away
Are they peeling eggs for you
: What are you laughing for
I have to smell my nails: I am forced to guess, due to lack of information
To eat a bell : To get fined
(Curly) hairs
: Nonsense
For the one you mentioned we usually say :
Έκανες την τρίχα τριχιά,
which sounds like "ekanes tin tricha trichia" accents where you see them
This means literally "you turned the hair into strong rope".
Other than those we have a few very funny ones imo as follows:
Ζήσε Μάη μου να φας τριφύλλι (zise mai mou na fas trifili)

I don't think many Italians take notice of it
when I was learning Italian I used it to look up the gender of words beginning with 'w' such as weekend and website
They were masculine as I thought, but according to the AdC they should take the Lo article instead of the Il article
All Italians say 'il weekend', 'i website' etc But the grammatically correct would be 'lo weekend' and 'gli website'.
Everytime I say 'lo weekend' and 'gli website' Italians look at me like I'm crazy, but I'm only following what the AdC judgement says
Huh, this is the article I consulted, which comes down pretty strongly in favour of lo/gli for W words
I'm with you on this one, but in the context that there would still be some basic rules so that the language each region speaks would still be identified as English
That's the best part imo, this is in a way what allows it to evolve
>Identified by whom as English though
I guess by those who have it as an official language
>What to do when everyone ignores these rules
Nothing
it's only a matter of preservation and better communication
>Why does it matter if divergent forms of English eventually come to be identified as different languages
I think I got on the wrong foot here
I am all in for the creation of new languages especially in times like these where globalization makes it all the more difficult for them to sprout
I am just saying that if we were to put some basic rules in the definition of the English language  we would achieve better communication
Not  to mention how much this will help with the understanding of foreign speakers of English who will now have a common basis which they can all follow and which would be largely agreed upon thus ensuring better and easier communication between people
On the contrary I believe that without those basic rules there could arise some major problems concerning the use of said language
For example, if a group of people create their own dialect based on the English language, right now there are no rules to determine if this would still be English or a brand new language, and so they could still identify it as whichever of the two
The problem is that if this dialect is to different than the English language (spoken by let's say UK, Australia and the US) people would not be able to understand it and so it would create confusion as to which language is actually English and which is not
Not to mention the difficulties that would arise in areas like government, economy, trade, communication in general etc
All in all, I believe that if we establish the basics of what the English language is, we would give rise for people to be able to identify their own dialects or even their own languages based on English, because this way they would be sure if what they are speaking is different to English because it just wouldn't follow these rules
I'm pretty sure this and many other languages that derive from others exist not because their language of origin didn't have rules but because its speakers didn't care to follow what the original language had
The fact that the existence of unifying rules doesn't play such an important role at the formation of new language is clear from the fact that many newly evolved languages were created from language which actually had such rules
In fact, in my opinion these rules will only be beneficial for the English language as they will help with the communication and it's understanding by people who don't already speak it

City rivalry in Greece is as follows: Athens vs Thessaloniki on the correct way to order souvlaki
apart from Athens - Salonika, Volos - Larissa was a big rivalry for about two decades
it was because Larissa is the administrative hub of Thessaly and they wanted everything to be there
for instance they wanted the coastal guard to be based there although  Volos is the  port with the sea and all and Larissa is 60 Km away from the sea
and this feeling of resentment of Larissa from Volos grew out in football too
but the last decade or so things have subsided
Athens and Thessaloniki for sure, they're the 2 biggest cities in Greece and because we have a few diffrences in our vocabulary we like to make fun of each other
Also football teams
Not just the football teams, I don't think there is another city in the world that claims to be a symprotevousa  (sub-capital
or something)
We also diss each other a lot for the different words we use, such as the souvlaki/kalamaki dispute
Γιατι το ειπε ο Μπάμπης ο Σουγιάς;
Well, we didn't just come up with this co-capital thing, it's a reference to Thessaloniki being the co-reigning city of the Byzantine Empire alongside Constantinople
My ex from Odense definitely agrees with you
Here we go again bois
Well shit, after OP pulled the pin, I was expecting the worst, but I'm happy to have found such an even-keeled response
Hopefully maybe a few more 16 year olds can chime in as well rather than the flame war I was expecting
what he wants sounds more like unification with Turkey
*with approval of Greece and Turkey*
What does Greece and Turkey have to do with this ?
But there is no state of the Northern Cyprus outside the imagination of Turkey, that's the thing
It's a military occupied area
It's impossible for Turkey to keep claiming protection and intervention rights without appearing as the outlaw aggressor to the eyes of the entire world
Since when are grey areas in international accepted borders
Oh wait since Turkish Leaders invent them in the 90s and almost start a war over it
In case you're missing it, nobody on the planet recognizies it
As for Turkey protecting an independant state, protecting it from what exactly ? There was no and there is no independant state, Turkey created an occupied area by having its armed forces invading and displacing civilians (to put is as politely as possible)
With your words you pretty much reaffirm Turkey's stance and discourse on the matter, so the discussion from my part ends here
No wonder why a unification seems impossible
No and it's deeply disappointing
The one exception I can think is Atlantis which was so strange to me
My friends watched it dubbed and the florist has a stereotypical italian accent in Greek, along with a very flamboyant type of speech which is just so foreign to me
in Greek it's been a long time since i last watched it but if i remember correctly they had a hippie stoner accent
in Greek giving Greek accents rarely happens unless it's "country accent" where they're given islander accents or Cretan accent , meybe even Cypriot
[Here is a video about Greek dialects and accents]
Greek has Cretan and Cypriot that are distinct dialects from the respective islands
There used to be three or four different dialects from Asia minor but they are mostly/almost dead because of the Greek genocide and uprooting
And then there's the two dialects which I'd personally classify as district languages but they are called dialects because in everyone's mind there has only ever been one Greek language, Greek since medieval times
But these are Griko language of Calabria and Salento spoken only in a handful of villages and dying with the new generations, and Tsakonian from a few villages in the Peloponnese that's thought to originate from Doric, one of the ancient Greek languages, so it would mean it split from standard thousands of years ago, it is also dying with the new generations sadly
Didn't even know Caernarfon had it's own dialect and I live 15 minutes from there
You mean so instead of being sub branches of it they are similar languages that developed together with and not from Italian
Pineapple was made by a Greek in Canada by the way
Greekness never goes away, ask a Greek
Joking aside I don't think we get blamed for anything really
There were people in the US who thought since my cousin had black hair, he must be Muslim
I guess that  but in Greece nothing really
Not the same really but some turks say that homer was apparently Turkish
I don't know how the got that but some turks actually believe this
That
was brutal
At least let them have their espresso first before you break their heart
It's still  6:58 AM there
Exactly
Fucking stupid isn't it
A website called all about Turkey is talking about homer
And they say he was born in Izmir
I don't know what's the deal with them tbh
Most turks are fine but there's a very vocal minority that has a pretty big superiority complex
I'm also from Asia minor so that adds insult to injury lol
It's posted in on a website called all about Turkey dude
Aside from that I've seen ppl on Instagram for example claim that he's Turkish
Now all tobacco products are 21 in the US
No you don't understand me I've seen people claim he was turkic ethnically
I've seen numerous dudes but ok
Yeah but the trojans could very well be hellenistic
And ionians are taught to be one of the three major Greek tribes
How would the ionians be Turkish in any way shape or form
The turks were in the Asian steppes when the ionians settled in Western anatolia
You made the assumption that it was somehow taught that anatolia ionians were somehow linked to the turks
Stating that in fact the opposite is stated in the Turkish educational system
If nobody thought that ionians where Turkish you wouldn't have stated the obvious
Alright to end off this conversation I just said that I've seen some turks, not all turks, claim that he is ethnically Turkish
In Greece we have this subject in junior high and high school, the name of which directly translates to "religions" and it pretty much focuses on Christianity, as you would imagine, but in one grade we also learned some things about Hinduism, Buddhism and Muslim (I actually learned about Ramadan in that class lol)
Most ppl don't care about it bc they prob don't care about religion in general but imo it could be taught in a much better way (aka why would there be exams and tests for that
And why focus so much on Christianity, basically making it like church but worse bc it's school
Doesn't that make it more unappealing for the students
I haven't heard of a similar subject in any other country but I'm curious to know if there's anything similar that I just haven't heard of
Oh we have that as well
What language do the inhabitants use to communicate with each other
I guess Russian is used as a common tongue
I was speaking with some Turks who said that in school they're taught that Greeks loved living under the Ottoman Empire and only rebelled because they were brainwashed by the western powers which is, certainly, a take I had not heard before
lol @ Turkey
All the time
Do you want me to go way back to the ottoman empire, the pontic Greek genocide, or are we covered with the daily news
I think lately we share a much more common view on these events
There were Bulgarians majorities and Greek majorities in different cities
Our countries fought each other on who will be in charge once the Turks are ousted
You claim most of Macedonia was filled with Bulgarians, we with Greeks, and Turks, well, with Muslims
It's the North Macedonians who have am entirely different story
I visited the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle in Skopje and it was a really weird experience
It started with an explanation about how Alexander the Great was actually Macedonian not Greek (?) and then went into an exhibit about how Gotse Delchev was an "ethnic Macedonian" who had no connection to Bulgaria or Bulgarians (who are basically never mentioned once in the whole museum)
Like, I understand that the museum tells the Balkan Wars from their perspective, just like the museum in Thessaloniki tells it from our perspective (and I'm sure that the Bulgarians, Serbs, Turks, Romanians and Albanians have their own perspectives), but I mean, there is perspective and then there is being totally divorced from reality
That said, I spent a lot of time in North Macedonia and speaking to ordinary people, many were embarrassed by the antiquisation program of Gruevski, and others took more nuanced views on the Balkan Wars, so I'm not blaming an entire people for their former dictator's vanity projects
Yup
Not because "they are not very nice", but because they are very comfortable
I use them practically like pajamas
same
Well I don't think Italians get offended by it, but we sing with pride the "Duce puts his uniform" a Greek song that mocks the Italians for losing the war with Greece in WWII
It's pretty funny because we sing it in the school events every 28th of October (Ochi day/No day, the day we said "no" to Italians)
You are right, but I wasn't the most attending when these school events happened so my knowledge is limited
Sorry for the (quite) late reply
CKII: I often play as Byzantine Emperor restoring the empire, or some local lord in Greece restoring Hellenism
I enjoy tutorial Ireland and raiding vikings
I also like playing muslims and get to control temple holdings, usually starting in Baghdad or Egypt
Merchant republics were fun but I enjoy them more in modded games like Elder Kings or the late Birthright
EU4: I haven't played much as I am missing a lot of DLC
I enjoy colonizing Brazil as Portugal and fending off Euros as Iroquis
Tried to restore the Byzantines a couple times but it's too damn hard
We don't really have long place names, the longest I can think of right now is Αιτωλοακαρνανία [etoloakaɾnaˈnia] at 15 letters
I think so yeah, in the Victorian times
But it's definitely old at this point, live next to it, there's about two three shortenings that everyone uses to refer to it
London; there's always a bunch of people in their ferraris zooming around the roads blasting loud music
I cant tell you a number, but I've seen a lot of Albanian, Bulgarian and bizarrely French license plates here
the ones i see the most are German Romanian Albanian and Bulgarian
but i've also come across swiss, Belgian French quite a few times
Edit: i missunderstood the question i think the UK and Russia take the cake
We say "Παπάκι" (Papaki) which literally means duckling
I have no idea why, it looks nothing like a duckling, but I like it
We call it "duckling" in Greek (παπάκι = diminutive of duck)
Honestly, it doesn't real look like a duckling, but I think it's really cute
On a sidenote, we also call "duckling" [this type of small motorcycles] which make up around 90% of motorcycles in Greece, so it could be related to this
It's pretty bizzare but really cute at the same time to be honest hahaha
''Παπάκι'' (papaki) and it means duckling
In Greek it's παπακη (papaki) which means duckling
Papaki (παπάκι) meaning duckling or little duck
It does look a bit like it though
(Lol nope)
"Papaki" which translates to "little duck" . I know
it makes no sense
Serbia, Italy, Spain
Serbs are our brothers because we have the same religion and we fought together in the Balkan wars
Spain and Italy have cultures similar to ours
I usually cheer for the underdog or Cyprus if they are in the tournament
I'll often cheer for Italy as well
I root for every team that plays the more attractive football/basketball (that's the only 2 teams sports I know)
I always root with the opponent of Italy, unless they play against Spain or Germany
I always root with the opponent of Spain and Germany
In football I always root with the opponent of Greece (unless it's Spain or Germany)
In basketball, though, I'm with us !
That's not really true
I find myself cheering for Italy, Spain , Portugal often
Unless we are playing each other
I know you guys are technically a Mediterranean country, but we usually see you as part of the Yugoslavian lobby
So propably just Italy, France (not always), Spain, Portugal, Cuprus and Malta (?)
He asked for Mediterranean and Southern countries
You guys certainly are a southern country
It kinda depends on the matter
If you are talking about politics or economy you guys are closer to the Central Europe lobby
**England (a small West Midlands university town)** : people drinking in Saturday morning
Super weird
People thinking that "having fun" = "drink so much that you vomit on the street and then pee or poop in the bushes". And not only silly students, but 50 year old guys
drinking culture is one thing, making yourself like this is another
**Spain (Zaragoza)**: it is literally impossible to get something you need/want done on time
Official schedules aren't followed, half the people are never on time, organization is non-existent
Also, people going out every day for tapas/partying/"light drinking". I loved that part
**Germany (Stuttgart)** : the city gives vibes of a big village
The people are not social at all, obsessed with every small rule they have, either written or unspoken
Eeerie silence in parks and trains
Great public transport (although expensive)
Germans from Stuttgart were like completely different people from the ones I had met abroad (and happened to be from Berlin and Cologne)
**Ireland (Dublin) :** huge amount of Brazilians
I knew about Polish and Lithuanians having a presence in Dublin, but not about Brazilians
You hear Portuguese on the street everywhere
The streets are generally clean, much better than what I expected (I expected something like Leeds or Sheffield)
The city is bipolar : it has beautiful parts that are amazing to walk, chat, see, do stuff, and parts that look like an abandoned dangerous industrial zone with shady personalities lurking in the corners (although nothing has even happened to me)
i havn't gone outside of Greece yet but my sister moved to Germany  a year ago and when my mom went to visit her (has never traveled, is very religious, and doesn't speak english, doesn't really like Germany) she said that it was very clean but everything seemed boring and lifeless, she also said the people seemed like robots and emotionless
i know her view might be seen as offensive but it's cool to see the mind of an old conservative Cretan Greek lady who only believes what facebook tells her
That's most of Europe except Germanic and Scandinavian countries to be honest
It is you who are anti-small talk :)
Is this the last meal of the day then
I mean supposing you go to sleep around 23:00, aren't you awfully hungry again by then

Our microstate is the Mt

There are literally trillions of Euros stashed there in gold silver and the like
Plus you know no separation of church and state
I don't know if its the only place, but yeah women aren't allowed there
Well something something Turkey
Propably turkey
Hmm sounds good
Austria wants to start another world war, what's new
The people were very keen to follow the politicians last time though
Yes we have patsadika where you can eat things like fasolada(bean soup), patsas which is a soup that contains stomach and other unused parts of the animal, fakes(lentils) and other similar traditional dishes at a very low price, these are usually associated with the working class
No by the concept per ce as milk bars
We have what we call in Greece "Magiria". There are like tavernas, but they serve only traditional Greek food and especially "daily" picks (meaning that they don't have stable menu dishes, but they cook every day fresh dishes)
They serve alcohol
Cozy little places, with better food than tavernas, most of the time and "grandma" cooking recipes
By the way, I am completely in love with your country and its people

In Greece it's called a "σκονάκι" (skonáki - /s̠ɡ̥o̞ˈnɐci/)
It literally means "little dust", I have no idea why we call it that
Edit: Apparently according to another commenter it means "a small dose of medicine or drug in powder form". Interesting
In Greek it's "skonaki". I don't know the etymology of the word, but it roughly translates in "little/small dust".
we call it "σκονάκι" (skonaki) meaning pouder with the ending -aki indicating it's small
In Greek its called "σκονάκι" which literally means "dust" from σκόνη and - άκι which is a diminutive
So it's like saying  "small dust" xD
I legit thought σκονακι means little dust
i remember an old movie where the students cheats on their finals exams (I think it was ροδα τσαντα και κοπανα) and the teacher asks a student "what's that on your desk" and she replies "σκονακι για τα δοντια μου" and then she opens it and it's actually filled with powder . That's the one time i have seen it used literally
Wow that's interesting
>It's a shame we don't have sufficiently large databases for the Greek language to investigate when the modern sense of the word was first used
couldn't have said it better
It really bothered me when I was in school because I always saw them in movies, but now I realise it's because we had all of our classes in the same room, so we could just leave everything on our desks
Nop and after i started high school I just left all the *useless* books below my desk
I won't carry them back and forth from my house for no reason and apart for those I literally can't think of anything I would have a locker for
We have most of our classes in the same room
It really bothers me though cos I don't want to - and, frankly, don't need to - carry much wait on my back daily since I already have spinal problems
No public school in greece has lockers, everyone carries their books in backpacks
Though you can leave your books on a shelf under your desk
We have backpacks in which we bring all our books for the day
Lockers are frankly regarded as something exclusively American
Personally, I've carried a bag weighing about 8-10kg back and forth from school everyday for 11 years now
At this point I can hear my back begging me to drop out
The high school i went to had lockers for books for every student
It is actually really convinient not to carry a heavy backpack all the time
No, we just carried the books in our backpacks
Although the desk had something underneath it where you could put books and many students (especially those who didn't care about studying) just left them under there for the whole season
Γιατί σε ενοχλούσε?
Why did it bother you
Excuse me why did you take your shoes off at school
Exactly the same in Greece
Was it a private school
Because I'm pretty sure such luxuries don't exist in public schools
I don't know I guess I liked how in TV shows everyone decorated theirs and it just looked like a cool thing to have
You probably know that Greek schools are lacking in many departments so it was just another thing that we didn't have
I'd say around 7, but we also carry, however, some notebooks and miscellaneous stuff like phone and keys
Overall the heaviest load I remember putting in my backpack was around 3
5 kilos
No, it is actually a public school
I'm pretty sure that it's the only one in the city i live that has lockers
We also had different classrooms for each subject so that made the lockers even more useful
Not sure why the school worked like that but it was cool lol
But we really did not need it, it's not like it's something expensive to install or something, but useless for our schools
>That's just not normal
It is in my country
We don't just walk around school barefoot
Yes and yes
My kindergarden had a playground and gym equipment outdoors, and the indoors was for reading, eating, painting etc
So our shoes didn't touch anything other than the floor when we were indoors
You don't go to kindergarden when you're 1-2, you go at 4-5
- 10^6 = ekatommýrio
- 10^9 = disekatommýrio (Twice 10^(6))
- 10^12 = trisekatommýrio (Three times 10^(6))
- 10^15 = tetrakisekatommýrio (Four times 10^(6))
- 10^18 = pentakisekatommýrio (Five times 10^(6))
- 10^21 = eksakisekatommýrio (Six times 10^(6))
You get the pattern
10\^6 = εκατομμύρια
10\^9 = δυσεκατομμύρια
It's basically million and billion
No Milliard
Edit: Wow, it seems like Greek is basically the exception to all other European countries
I actually had never heard of the concept of Milliard till I watched a numberphile video on it
Million and Billion had made the most sense to me, since that is what I had learnt both in English and Greek
In Greece itself δισεκατομμύριο is translated to billion and corresponds to the order of nine zeroes
This is the order commonly cited in the news when referencing numbers pertaining to national finances, so there really is no common confusion about what it means
The word for million is εκατομμύριο and literally means one hundred times ten thousand
Billion (10\^9) is twice-million (δισεκατομμύριο/disekatomirio), trillion (10\^12) is thrice-million (τρισεκατομμύριο/trisekatomirio), and so forth
edit: Hadn't head of long scale numbering unitl now, can't see how calling a quadrilion a "billiard" makes more sense but I guess I'm just not used to it
Catacomb (Κατακόμβη) - The term catacomb is derived from the greek *κατά* and the latin *cuba* which is a loan from the greek *κύμβη* which means *tumulus*.
Not many have been saved in Greece
The most well-known is the one at Thessaloniki and the one at the island of Milos
First Christians found refuge, prayed and finally had the grave for their material body
Milos Catacombs: [
We don’t have Catacombs but Athens does have underground passages which were used for safety during the World Wars
Theres quite a few articles about them, in greek, but they can’t be visited
Only in private tours if you ever find them — I actually have spotted a couple on Facebook from some recreational groups I follow
We have the oldest records of a language still spoken today, from 1500BC clay tablets written in Linear B. Id say we stand out because we've have a continuous culture and language since the bronze age
Southeast\*
Yup, Greece
Mycenaean Greek was written in a pre alphabet script that was decoded about 100 years ago, confirming it as Greek
That's Linear B. There's Linear A from Crete that's still uncracked and it's quite likely because it's not Greek as there's evidence that a language shift towards Greek might have happened during the bronze age
For me at least it goes as such: post Byzantine Greek (1453AD +), I understand just fine but it's gonna use some weird words and what not
Medieval Greek, I understand with a few problems, although usually it's because they wrote it weirdly, without gaps or with shortened words
Koine Greek, the common Greek from Jesus' time (so 50AD) I recognize most words in sentence and make out the meaning most of the time, only tried reading it in the Bible but I'm biased maybe because I know the way things are phrased in the Bible
Attic Greek (400BC) I'll recognise grammar and structure along with words but it'll be fairly hard to make out a meaning
Homeric Greek (700-800BC) I think I'd recognize grammar, so verbs nouns etc but not make out the meaning cause they are not in use today a lot of them, studied it for a year in school but don't remember how hard it was tbh
After would come Mycenaean Greek (1500BC +- few centuries) I haven't tried reading or something but it's fair to say the modern Greek would almost certainly not understand it, but I think it's likely you'd still find roots of words and recognise parts of the grammar and language
So yeah even tho it hasn't changed nowhere near as much as many other languages Greek has still changed quite a bit to the point where it's unintelligible, but it's a pretty clean evolution from outside interference
The problem with linear A as well is that it's written in syllables so each symbol would be a syllable, this means that for example Knossos is written as Ko-no-so
So I don't know if it can be accurately transplanted into the alphabet
I think he just tried to guess what old languages are still spoken without much thought about the script
It's a very interesting situation
There's Linear A, but at about the same time there's Cretan hieroglyphics present in Crete
There's records from classical Greece that there used to be a language spoken in a few places that was dubbed 'eteocretan'  by ancient Greeks, meaning 'true cretan', but that was 1000 years after the linear A and hieroglyphics so we don't know how well related they might have been, there's a few inscriptions in eteocretan but nothing can be figured out well from them
On top of that Homer mentions that Crete had many languages mingled together so we don't even know for sure if eteocretan, linear A and/or hieroglyphics are the same languages
There's inscriptions with eteocretan and Greek side by side so at least it can be figured out that it's not in the Greek family
So it's anyone's guess if these languages were Indo-European, Semitic, but there have been found inscriptions of a Tyrrhenian language in Lemnos which matches with ancient records of a Pelasgian pre Greek language being spoken there so who knows again if it's related to that
Just annoying that it's likely we'll never know
Nope, and most of the bus drivers are assholes anyway
No, that's just weird
lol, nope
No fucking way, they are usually dicks and NEVER on time
*watching you run towards them and starting driving when you are a metre away intensifies*
If you are asking about the "Being dicks" part, it's hard to explain without living it for yourself
I'd say that they are very rude towards the passengers, so when you ask them something they try to not respond and if they have to it's a short and rude reply
Second, they are angry towards anything
And lastly, they speak on the fucking phone/smoking while driving
Of course this is a generalization but it's common knowledge that they act like that; most of them do
The time thing
there's basically no point to look at the bus schedule
You just go at the bus stop and hope for the best
If you pass by the sarting point you can see them all chilling and smoking when they are supposed to be already on the road
Italy's boot shape and Cyprus' swordfish-y shape are my favorite
Honorable mention goes to Denmark for being different
Way too square for me personally
As in the shape is way too regular, lacks peninsulas and gulfs and the likes
Turkey (and I mean Turkey, not Erdogan) is extremely direspectful towards international treaties and laws
They do foreign policy by bullying, blackmailing, threatening and invading, and they seem to think that this is perfectly normal and international law is "unfair" to them
They constantly disrespect Greek and Cypriot territorial borders, now they do the same with Syria because they do not like the Kurds
No matter what their problems with the Kurds are within their borders, they have no right to invade a foreign country, but when did they care about that to care now
Another genocide
It's not like it will affect us, right ?
Do you feel safe writing that comment on reddit
Which doesn't matter because foreign policy is not affected by Islam or liberalism
Just send strongly worded letters instead, that will work !
What about Catalans
Almost all the time, it's hard to get completely rid of your original accent
Writing
I *would of* known immediately
That was the point of my comment, you can pinpoint native speakers by their "would of"s.
It's a mistake that makes more sense if you speak the language but you don't always write it down, yet it's totally weird for English learners because you can immediately see that this thing doesn't exist in the written language
There is never a "would/could/should of", it just SOUNDS like "whould've".

- βλέπω τα ραδίκια ανάποδα (to see the radishes upside down)
- πηγαίνω στα κυπαρίσσια (to go [under] the firs)
- τα πίνω με τον Άγιο Πέτρο (to have a drink with St
Peter)
- μυρίζω/τρώω χώμα (to smell/eat dirt)
..to name a few
No phrases with "bite" though
Same in Greek
"Βλέπω τα ραδίκια ανάποδα", same meaning
My guess is that immigrants (or bilinguals in general) translated the expression from their native language, and it stuck
No idea where it originated though
I'd say Greek and German are pretty similar, definitely more so than Greek is to English
Yes, that's it
1)We have a unique alphabet
2) We can understand a lot of words from Latin language speaking countries, but they can't understand us
3) We are the first Orthodox nation to join the west and EU
4) Gun and ammunition control is ridiculous, but we still don't have as many gun crimes as other European nations(if any Greek question me on this, I am from Crete)
5) We eat a lot
Like, really, a lot
I used to work in hotels and I have seen the difference
Either we are the normal ones and the others eat a little, or we eat too much
Maybe south Italians can compete us, but definitely not the central and northern Europeans
Especially the Germans who take a family pizza and it's enough for a family of four
Greek music and dances are very diverse but still unique
Greek cuisine too isn't very similar to any other European country
We have our own unique alphabet too
I guess that makes us your colony
Yep, we do exactly the same
And then travel abroad and have to either stress out to find a place for dinner in our normal afternoon coffee time or spend the night on an empty stomach
In the big cities they won't close the offices and most shops midday though
I am from Greece and I definitely can say that we have a lot of similar gestures
When I came to Italy, I already knew most of them
Greece would like to co-sign this petition
Same mealtimes over here, sending revolutionary greetings
Just come to Greece and feel free to eat the whole restaurant
Yeah
In Greece the food quality just needs to be in a basic good level
Then it's the portion
We like having our eyes full first and then the stomach
I am not talking only about the law
Most guns here are illegal, but there are still  a lot
It's easier to find a good AK47 in Crete, than to do all the needed regulations and buy a hunting rifle
We actually mock Germans on how little they eat and for that, not many restaurant owners like them
They aren't officially
There are very strict gun laws
But in the rural areas, especially in Crete, there are a lot
I live near there, if you need anything dm me
If you come, go to local restaurants that are not seen easily by the tourists
You will be served good and big portions here
Can confirm
Cyprus is Greece too
It might be a different nation but it's the same people
We even have the same national anthem, did you know that
And, heh, Turkey is not European
Besides that though, Greeks and Turks are very similar, at some regards almost identical and the fact that the Greeks are European and the Turks are not, means European is only a geographical term and nothing more than that
So does Cyprus
Totally agree with that
It's the people's culture
from spotify and my own experience i think it's [Toquel, Sin Laurent - Pistoli] (pistoli means handgun)
Wait all this time I heard this song was not in English
Is there any remix of it somewhere maybe
To be fair I usually listen while driving or working so
Hehe
Thrace is full of muslims so it kinda sticks out
I'm from a village in Northern Greece, close to the North Macedonia border (Aridaia, a town near Edessa)
In the north part of the country, near the borders, there's a wide region where people have mostly Slavic genetics and speak a weird Slavic idiom (in addition to Greek, of course) that sounds nowhere close to Greek
It sounds like a mixture of Macedonian, Bulgarian and Serbian
My dad and I have been mistaken for Bulgarians quite a few times
For me Crete is even more weird
What kind of Muslims
Pomaks
Turks
Gypsies
other
A) It is the actual name of the region, it has always been Thrace, unlike North Macedonia which has not always been considered Macedonia, certainly not in ancient times, b) Thracians have long been assimilated (as slavs, Turks or Greeks), there is no one left to claim the name, c) we do not claim to be the heirs of the ancient Thracians, d) neither Bulgaria nor Turkey is any more or any less entitled to that name than we are, all three have the same right to use it because the Thracians no longer exist, which cannot be said about the Greek Macedonians
If any Thracian wants to complain about cultural appropriation, they are more than welcome to do so
Lots of guns and like family feuds
It's like Sicily more than Greece
Has what now
> another person shot at the sun because it was too hot
I see the spirit of Heracles is alive in those anatolian lads
I don't think Crete is any different than rest of Greece in that respect
They even have areas on the mountains that are proud to have never been conquered (by Turks, Greeks, anyone) and the police is still pretty cautious to go there
Anything by Sin Boy, Snik, TUS, Vera Lamprou, Derek Leontis, Konnie Metaxa, Popi Malliotaki, the singers from the Annita Pania's shows etc
This is quite bad too:
Greece only produces bad music
Late to the party, but this is good stuff hahahah
This guy, along with other dudes like that, are like the hillbillies, rednecks of Greece
What the actual fuck
Thank you
I guess
Yes but this one is a parody tho
Dutch rap is not that bad
Quite the opposite, Dutch rap is among the best rap at Europe imo
hahaha holy shit
Don't forget Skyladiko & Tallava
You would absolutely not do an one-night stand if you're living with parents
Bringing your long term partner happens, but I don't think most people would be comfortable having sex when their parents are right outside
I don't think people who live with their parents ever bring the girl home but personally (im 17) I just have to bring her when my parents are absent or ask my dad to take my mom and little brother somewhere
We used to have a Ministry for Deregulation but it got cut for budgetary reasons
I really like it, i don't think i could find a better alternative
The greek one is named "Hymn to Liberty" and it was written while Greece was under turkish rule
I think people here love the lyrics a lot but they love the music even more
> I shall always recognize you
by the dreadful sword you hold,
as the Earth with searching vision
you survey with spirit bold
>From the Greeks of old whose dying
brought to life and spirit free,
now with ancient valor rising
Let us hail you, oh Liberty
I love my anthem, its great and very patriotic
Tbf, dissing the Austrians was a pretty damn popular thing to do if you were a poet in the XIXth century:
>Through the clouds above he spots thee
>too the Eagle's eye while his
>wings and claws are growing doughty
>on Italian carcasses
[Greek national anthem (Hymn to Liberty), Stanza 26 out of 158
Edit: Typos, formating
yep i love my anthem
Not sure if they are exclusive of Greece, candidates would be:
\- [this] a 17lt olive oil canister, this particular pattern is the standard if you buy it directly from an oil mill/producer
\- [this] wicks meant to float on a glass filled with olive oil, burned as a memorial for the deceased, either on their grave or in a corner of the house
Edit: The only thing that we don't have here from everything that has been mentioned already is this English bird pie thing
I didn't even know such a thing exists
A Frapé mixer
Rakí in a water bottle
(Most) Távli board
Some kind of furniture from grandparents
(Crete) Guns
Shit load of Religious Orthodox icons
Also [this bad boi]
My suggestion was not concerning an oil can in general, rather the particular one
The logic behind it is if olive oil gets exported, it is branded, so the cans have the logo and graphics of the brand
This one is used only for bulk, which is a typical thing to do as many people have their own groves or families/friends with groves or just prefer to get it from their/a village
Also, a family usually buys fresh oil once per year, thus the 17lt size is so popular
The pattern of this can is iconic, you 'll see it doubling as a flowerpot and a designer even made a shopper bag with it
The bad boy exists elsewhere too, marketed as milk frother
It's like marketing Christiano Ronaldo as a basketball player
he may shoot a hoop or two in his free time but that's not his true calling
No native speaker, but teacher of English as foreign language
For some reason, Greek students love the word "nowadays", some of them will throw it in every composition they write
In Greek like with many other languages we just have a verb for the act of sex
&#x200B;
There are obviously many phrases for sex and off the top of my head they all use the "do".
**do sex**
I am not sure about literature, but we have the "yellow press" meaning news channels/ newspapers etc
which are perceived to not be very serious, which report news that are controversial
We call it crow language ( korakistika - κορακίστικα ) and we add **ka** every syllable
Yes, we have something called ''podana''. Basically you just cut the word in half and you put the last half in front of the word
The name comes from the word ''upside down'' (anapoda) which is in podana itself
We mainly used it in high school if we didn't want the teacher to know what we were saying
For example: Ti ora einai (What time is it
) = It rao naiei (Tawh meti se ti
Yep
We have "κορακίστικα" (Raven language)
You add a "tsi" in front of every syllable
There are some variations but this is the one I knew as a kid
>  Sweden
Alternatively you can speak Danish and you'll get the same reactions
Sounds similar to what I was about to say about Greek
It works that way, it is called korakistika, which translates to crow's language
Either Alexander not dying early, or having emperor Romanos winning Manzikert
Otherwise, Greece winning the Asia Minor Expedition
The fall of Constantinople because it just seems more right if we had Constantinople as a capital because of our history with the Byzantine Empire
We haven’t owned the city for over 500 years
Also, it would be cool if Agia Sofia became a functional church so that I could go one day for a liturgy, that would be very fun
Personally, I would like to see what would have happened had we beaten the invading Germans in 1941
I think it would have a major impact on the upcoming operation barbarossa
Too options that popped in my mind would be
a) we don't interfere and back Greek nationalist groups in Cyprus cause that's what sparked the war in Cyprus, if we didn't do that Cyprus would be united fully independent with Turkish and Greek Cypriots coexisting (we had a military junta at the time)
b) 1941 when yugoslavia joined the war the Greek command trusted that Yugoslavia would hold out for a while and left no armies on the yugoslav Greek border, so when yugoslavia fell apart all Greek armies in Macedonia and Epirus where surrounded, if we had done that maybe we could've held on longer the last Allied foothold in mainland Europe and without the occupation there wouldn't have been so many Greek civilian deaths (the Greek army was pretty capable and if they weren't surrounded defense was easy on such a terrain, a terrain where blitzkrieg isn't possible)
Maybe I could think of some better stuff but I don't know
Oh boy where do I start
Probably I would change the fact that Venizelos gave the non Greeks the right to vote, because when he gave them the right to vote, they voted for the opposite party which promised that they would end the micro Asia war, but instead they continued it and reached the war outside of Ankara and the west then abandoned us, we run out of bullets and the rest is history
If that wouldn't happen, we would have kept now Izmir
Also if I could, I would make the 1974 dictatorship of Greece to not trust the Americans when they promised that they would protect Cyprus
But eventually they did and the invasion happened
I disagree on this . Poli is very far in our history and as the Byzantine Empire, like most Empires, was meant to fall
It seemed inevitable
If I had a point of history I would change (or want to see what would happen if it wasn tlike that ) for sure will be when Kapodistrias was murdered
I always felt he had dreams and ambitions and had he lived our country would have been very different
The murder of Kapodistrias was one of the darkest turns our history took, indeed
If we want to be realistic, taking Constantinople and keeping it has not been a viable scenario for a long time
Perhaps since 1453
But the coast of Asia minor as well as Cyprus would be much more possible
Anyway, I agree that your answer is indeed better
In Greece it'd be the Klephts and Armatoloi for sure
They were highwaymen and brigands that mainly existed in the more mountainous areas around Greece were the Ottoman empire held limited control
Armatoloi were the ones amongst them that were commissioned from the empire to enforce the Sultans authority in such inaccessible areas
There were many bands with important leaders, that fought against the ottomans and existed throughout the ottoman occupation from the 15th to the 19th centuries
They are very important in modern Greek history because they formed the nucleus of the Greek Revolution in 1821, and the leaders of the various bands often became the generals of the war for independence
i'm kind of confused as to what you're asking about but my best guess would be the of the thieves during the Ottoman occupation, they would go around cause various problems and steal as a form of resistance this was very popular in Crete [this] is a pretty good depiction of what they would generally look like
i'm actually from a small Cretan village that was popular for being the capital of these thief groups called [Gonies (meaning peaks)]
Bottled water, retail price outside supermarkets
50 cents for a small bottle (500ml) and 1€ for a large bottle (1,5 liters)
So every time I travel abroad I find the prices of water extreme
The most shocking thing is that a lot of countries have higher prices for water compared to sodas, beer etc
WHY
In Greece you can't sell 0,5l of water for more than 50 cents and 1l for more than 1 euro
Yeah man, and you find them even cheaper, paradoxically in airports for example haha
It's considered a necessity/essential product so it's price is fixed
100% agree
I would just love not being poor
Even though Athens is the city with the most theaters i would like more theater opportunities and performing arts in general like Berlin and the England in general
I wish we could copy Norway's policies and Netherlands' bike-friendliness
(Greek-Italian here)
I would love the cleanliness and the organisation of Japanese culture
Estonia's public debt I guess (and the digital government thing probably)
Germany‘s respect for rules
In Greece many people think they’re above the law
Being an actor in Greece is a drama
Got ya mate
I respect your opinion but please no
Look at the Fin guy flexing his seasons there
Average sunshine days are similar in Greece and Portugal and there are many forest fires and droughts here too, many times deadly
BUT it’s still worth it, sunshine has a positive effect on people’s mental and physical health
say that brotha
Ok, ok I get what you said, and it’s the same here, but in my opinion it’s better to put sunscreen and a hat, or have the car seats be untouchable because of the heat or the tents down, than rain
My opinion, it’s not the best but that’s for me
(Edit: changed “beat” to “best”
Ouzo
It has many flavors,  Cherry, Orange, lemon, Mastiha, cranberry
Edit: It's a very strong beverage and always should be consumed in small amounts
Ouzo, Tsipouro and Retsina
The first two are mostly consumed by older "traditional" people and they don't taste particularly nice imo but the last one (a type of white wine) is widely consumed and it's a tasty and cheap way to get drunk *fast*
Probably ouzo (tastes like anise - or whatever you mix it with), tsipouro (tastes like rubbing alcohol - goes great with some seafood on the side) and raki (noone has managed to remember what it tastes like - or anything else for that matter)
It also accounts for some of the worst hangovers, but it is awesome with grilled octopus so we forgive it haha
Edit: Good thinking from your part for adding the dosage caution
Retsina is love, Retsina is life
Never tasted it nor I will ever
They do exist but they are in fact not so common (except maybe the mastiha one) and actually only the anise flavoured ouzo (which is the most popular) is considered by many Greeks to be the one and only true ouzo
I don't like it either
I found this on Wikipedia:
On October 25, 2006, Greece won the right to label ouzo as an exclusively Greek product
[3] The European Union now recognizes ouzo, as well as the Greek drinks tsipouro and tsikoudia, as products with a Protected Designation of Origin, which prohibits European makers other than Greece and Cyprus from using the name
I wouldn't say it is as popular as the ones mentioned above, but it is consumed occasionally by many Greeks
I solely use it in recipes
All I'll tell you is that you won't truly know it until you try it
To me ouzo together with grilled octopus is the ultimate Greek summertime meal and it is also very popular around here
How come
Too strong beverage
I mean, normally you only drink a little bit, just for the taste as they say
But I guess it all has to do with each person's preferences
I'm not a big fan of alcohol beverages
I've drunk a beer once and that's it
English is probably one of the easiest languages to learn
Actually, I think it's more interesting that it's our country's name that is completely different
Greece in greek is "Ελλάδα" (=Ellada) and Greek (as in the language) is "Ελληνικά" (=Ellinika)
A few come to mind, not cities though
France = Γαλλία = Gallia
The Netherlands = Κάτω Χώρες = Kato Hores (although everyone calls it simply Holland)
Corfu = Κέρκυρα = Kerkyra
Zante = Ζάκυνθος = Zakynthos
Greece = Ελλάς = Hellas
Athens is actually Athena (Αθηνα) in Greek
Cyprus' capital Nicosia is a much bigger difference though: English Nicosia vs
Greek Lefkosia
Corfu is Κέρκυρα (Kerkyra) in Greek, it comes from the greek word from summit, Κορφή. (there's a story about why the French and British called it that during their respective occupations of the island)
Also not a city but Greece doesn't even exist in Greek
It's Hellada or Hellas for short
Officially the Hellenic Republic
after some staring at a map i've found:
Nicosia= Lefkosia
Corfu= Kerkyra
Beirut= Viritos
Marseille= Massalia
Brussels=  Vrixelles
Nice= Nikea
Plovdiv= Filippoupoli (phillip town)
and obviously a lot of Turkish ones have their original name in Greek for example
Istanbul= Kostantinoupoli (Constantine town)
Edirne= Andrianoupoli (Andrianos town)
Konya= Ikonio
Bursa= Prousa
Ankara= Agkyra
We still say Peking here
If you say "Beijing", most people won't understand you at all, let alone that the only word for "Beijing" that's typed with the Greek alphabet has so bad of a SEO and displays mostly random results if you search for it
I was thinking maybe Tbilisi = Τιφλίδα = Tiflitha
and Trieste = Τεργέστη = Teryesti
I am not familiar with their etymology though, they could still be the same root
Oh wow I had no idea about Hungary, that's even more different in a way than ours
The Turkish names on those derive directly from their old Greek names, I'm therefore not sure if they fall in the category OP asked
E.g.
Bursa = Προύσα = Prousa
Kayseri = Καισάρεια = Kaisaria
Trabzon = Τραπεζούντα = Trapezounta
Konya = Ικόνιο = Ikonio
Samsun = Σαμψουντα = Sampsounda
And many more
Especially in towns like Izmir, Izmik, Izin and Istanbul the names derive from the Greek εις την = is tin (to the) that was commonly used in front of the name itself
E.g.
Σμύρνη = Smyrni = εις την Σμύρνη = is tin Smyrni = Ιzmir
Κωνσταντινούπολη = Konstantinoupoli = Istanbul, was named simply η Πόλη = I Poli (the town) therefore εις την Πόλη = is tin Poli = istanbul
Greek Farmer's Market Edition:
1€: three kilos of potatoes
10€: fifty large chicken eggs
100€: two synthetic pants, six pairs of socks, a pair of running shoes, two boxer shorts and three t-shirts
Farmer's market means that you will need those 100 euros again next month
Unless we are talking about underwear
Or you could repurpose that money and have the smile of 10 million lazy filthy Mediterraneans
Frying eggs and potatoes gets messy
It's easy to make friends with the vendors and ask about the quality, and also easy to find cheap and medium quality stuff
Fashion-wise the clothes are always sub-par
These days you get a receipt for even half a euro's worth of cucumbers, so I'm pretty sure they pay their taxes
It used to be a lot more free-wheeling, though
Farmer's Markets are absolutely essential where I live
I've made the calculations and shopping for the same stuff at the super market would easily cost me 2X-3X the money
Are potatoes supposed to be expensive
Why is your Italian flag washed out
Not really but sure
It's a systematic problem over here; it's slowly getting better, but the mindset lives on
Looks like we're winning on the cucumber front
It's actually a turkish coffee towel
Cool

OK so in Greek they use the word πλάκα meaning fun and the song goes:
Το Π σημαίνει παρέα δεμένη
*F stands for a group of friends strongly tied
Το ΛΑ η καρδιά λαχταρά
*U stands for what the heart wants
Το ΚΑ τα καλούδια που έχει η ζωή
*N stands for the nice things in life
Στη θάλασσα τη γαλανή
*In the blue sea :)
Man I will always remember this song XD
Here's what Greek handwriting looks like :)
Do we even have cursive
Also, handwritten it just looks like this: αβγδεζηθι
We write with printed-like letters
Most Greek Children don't know what cursive Greek looks like (or so I know at least)
Just printed but the art teacher tried to teach us some cursive in junior high
Some Greek calligraphy:
[Cursive]

Everything's overpriced in touristic areas
The less the people, the better the place is for a vacation usually
This happened to me too
Dude put a bracelet on me without asking and I had to give him 1 euro to get rid of him
How does the idea of eating octopuses sound to you
I have seen some videos where Americans freak out while trying to eat an octopus
For Greeks it is a totally normal thing to do
Do you find it disgusting
Weird
Unusual
No moving octopuses here, I find that disgusting too
In cuisines across Mediterranean octopus is cooked with a side of vinegar to ensure its dead
Let's goo neighbour
Let's show them some great food culture xD
Sounds tasty
Then you haven't taste Greek or any other Mediterranean cuisine
Can you say no to [this] ?
Or halázslé
Yeah I miss the sea :(
Me neither
That sounds gross
For real
Much love neighbour
I hope this madness between us ends soon
I'm sure both of us have reasons to hate each other if we look back, but I don't think it's worth it anymore
Creta
The gun ownership, the mafia, the vendettas, the drug trafficking have won a place in our heart for memes
They are something like THE SOUTHERN STATES for Greece
Great stuff, great memes
Pyrgos, in Ilia is also one of these meme places we've got
It's like the Florida of Greece
Instead of the Florida Man we've got Pyrgos/Ilia Man
Mykonos kind of, due to most tourists being mindless party goers
Also the fact that it is a major destination for LGB
As you can understand there are many memes and jokes about gay couples
As for the 1st point I made, well, you can check [this] out
Most of the times, when a reporter is asking something, like really basic, for example who is the President/P. Minister of Greece, or a REALLY basic historical fact, the party goers just sound stupid
Thessaloniki, only to a small extend since their unofficial motto is Χαλαρά/ Chill
BUT, the rest of Greece, except Athens Metro Area, is making fun of Athens, just because it's Athens
&#x200B;
EDIT: Added some things
I guess Mykonos and to a lesser extent Crete, though I can't quite put my finger on why for the latter
Maybe Thessaloniki too
Athens vs
Thessaloniki
People from Larisa talk with an accent and cannot be understood (am from there, not true)
People from Crete as well
Mikonos
Larissa, people speak in a heavy accent there
what's up with crete
*Lárisa too, mainly for the accent
*LARSA*
Yeah Cretans are really great
You'll have a great time
I've heard stories from a friend of mine who was born and raised there, where the local gangsters would have great relationship with tourists and would show them around, have a good time etc
They are also great with people from mainland Greece
However they usually talk shit about them behind their backs
Even though what I said was true, don't worry, you'll have a fantastic time
Creta is beautiful
What about it ? I don't think I've heard anything about Ilia
Or at least significant enough to be mentioned multiple times to become a meme
Maybe because I live in the capital
Guns, "Masculinity" ? "Manliness" sound a little more like it
Fair enough, although that's kind of an every-small-city kinda thing
+Sparta
What
what kind of site is that ? I've literally never seen it before
I've never come across it
Though I don't browse Greek stuff to begin with
Well it is better than the country I am currently living in
I would like to try something like that of I had the chance, but probably go for Canada tbh
Greece might be a shithole right now but there is no way I would leave for the US  because of the quality of life
I would move to another EU nation though
I personally would love to live there myself, but I can see why people dislike the culture
Aside from no free health care, no gun control and having to pay university tuition, I have heard truly disturbing rumors about what the stuff  they market as "Greek food" is like in the US, and I am not willing to put up with that
Absolutely not
I don 't know from where to start listing all the negative stuff
First of all, the health-care system would probably kill me
But if the healthcare doesn't do it, the lack of gun control will
Also you a lot of you guys  are very polarised and can't have a civil discussion most of the time (for example the border situation, even Greece does a better job keeping the immigrants in a livable condition)
I don't hate Americans, but I do hate this  kind of culture
Although you do have  a lot of job opportunities for us Europeans, if we don't study there and bankrupt ourselves
Dunno man, Scandinavian crime literature is extremely popular in my country
No one does crime noir as good as you do
So, is this a thing there in general, or only some companies offer this choice
Damn you guys are light-years ahead, congrats
And here over half of the working population works more than 40 hours
Proof that productivity doesn't have to do with how much time you spend at the office
I wish it was too private . I know everything about my sisters' in law births and I really wish I didn't but that's because they are my sisters' in law
In my family at least its not an issue discussing it . Its better than not knowing because each experience was different so you learn some things
In Greece, or at least in the town I live in, it is completely normal talking about pregnancy and labor, but mostly among women
In older generations, women would celebrate their daughters' first periods and they would give them all the advice they have on pregnancy and labor when they were with child
That usually happened among relatives and close friends, but, if they were fine with it, they could converse with any woman on this topic
Younger generations are slightly different
It is not a topic that is strictly restricted in female circles and it is only discussed when the pregnant woman is okay with having that conversation (which she is, at least 99% of the time)
However, the gossip stays still, an unbending rock in my culture's traditions and so, while it is not so common to overhear people who are/have been pregnant or even people who are not pregnant talking about it with painstaking detail, it can be a thing, mostly advice to teenage girls and soon-to-be parents, or even a quick elaboration on it while discussing a related subject
over here there's no such thing as too private lmao
especialy if you're in a small town and you do something stupid everyone will know before sunset
Λαχανοντολμάδες αυγολέμονο με πατάτες τηγανητές/Lahanontolmades avgolemono me patates tiganites
Essentially cabbage leaves stuffed with meatball mix with karolina rice (local variety afaik, no idea what's it called outside of Greece or if it's grown even), boiled then finished in thick avgolemono egg-lemon sauce
I've usually had it with fries, but some just add extra rice
A Souvlaki or spaghetti with minced meat
Maybe fried dough balls called Loukoumades
Naaaahhh I don't think that would be most people's choice
Maybe chicken soup (με αυγολέμονο, δε ξέρω αν έχουμε και άλλη), or spaghetti bolognese
There's the regular chicken soup, no eggs
As for others, they're wrong
Still, better than kids praising fast food like souvlaki or kalamaki as the pinnacle of Greek cuisine
That's what they call it in northern Greece too
Apparently just a similar name
Yes, and apparently there's many similar words in the Tosk dialect too
Isn't that more of a pasta á la créme
Ok so:
Ολλανδία (Ollandia, which is Netherlands)
Λευκορωσία (lefkorossia, White Russia, Belarus)
Γαλλία (Gallia, France)
Ελβετία (Helvetia, Switzerland)
Ελλάδα (Hellada, Greece)
Κύπρος (Kipros, Cyprus)
Λετονία (Letonia, Latvia)
Κυργυζία (Kyrgyzia, Kyrgyzstan)
Ισημερινός (isimerinos, literally equator, Ecuador)
Many people still use Βιρμανία, ie Burma for Myanmar
Also, this is a huge taboo subject, so please don't turn this into a debate, but Greeks don't call north Macedonia as such
They will still refer to the country as the capital (Skopje) or FYROM
Most countries
Hell, in english we dont call our country by its native name , we just call it Greece instead of Hellas
Pretty much standard endonym exonym scenario
Well Greece is Hellas normally,so almost every country has it wrong
Thank you Norway
My format is pronounciation, meaning (optional) and the country in English :)
Yes
A lot of cities retain their old names, idk why, but for Istanbul I think it's out of spite and/or sadness (lol, as if anyone alive knew it as Constantinople)
Souvlaki shops are known for their bad puns, like gyrobank (sounds like Eurobank), souvLike , souvlucky strike and so many more
I'm convinced that you're not given a permit to start a business in the food industry if the name of the store is not some kind of pun
Don't forget γυροκομείο (gyrokomio), which is a pun with the word γύρος (gyros), and γηροκομείο (nursing home)
I don't think I have seen a shop with an English pun, written in our alphabet
Only shops that have a normal greek name or whatever
I left the Greek puns out deliberately
Well, it might be different overall, but in the area of Athens where I live, it's maybe like 40% English alphabet and 60% Greek
Though, most shops written with English letters are just in what we call "Greeklish", which is basically writing Greek words with English letters (e.g. θέλω να φάω σουβλάκι {I want to eat souvalki} could be written as "thelw na faw souvalki"})
Now I don't know what exactly you mean by navigate, but yeah, shops are very close to being 50/50 Greek/English alphabet
English is compulsory for everyone and you can then choose between French and German as a second foreign language
The teaching level is really mediocre though, so the vast majority of students go to private language centers (or tutoring)
For some reason I've seen a lot of hedgehogs the last few days
This sucks so much man .Its gonna be December here and honestly watching the world cup in summer is the best thing ever
Also ,I dont want to sound bad ,but cmon ,Qatar doesnt care about football and football doesnt care about Qatar
Probably because they are
They have better sweets though
Variety most probably
Greek here, Greek cuisine is definitely not heavily spices based
Herbs yes but not spices
I think that the main difference is methods of cooking, quality of the ingredients, variety of the food
Good food doesn't need spices to taste good
Greek here i'm not sure what people mean by "spices" but Greek cuisine is definitely not heavily spices based
Herbs yes but not spices
I think that the main difference is methods of cooking, quality of the ingredients, variety of the food etc
Good food doesn't need spices to taste good
Greek food is actually heavily on the vegetarian side tho
>Spain and Greece just fry everything
lol what
What do we fry
Oof, what kind of fish you've been eating fam :P
Αγία Ρωμαϊκή Αυτοκρατορία. (Agia Romaiki Aftocratoria) (Greek)
In Greece we call it "Αγία ρωμαϊκή αυτοκρατορία". (Agía Romaïkí Aftokratoría) which literally translates to Holy Roman Empire
I remember the term Αγία Ρωμαιοκαθολική Αυτοκρατορία (Holy Roman-Catholic Empire) from school
they didn't call it that as the guy said
they probably called them franks or sth
Philologists here will always complain about loanwords
Generally you won't be disallowed from using foreign words (as long as you don't abuse them)
However, using foreign words, especially in writing, indicates a low educational level
I would suppose that this stems from the fact that there is a greek translation for everything, so not using the greek word communicates that you are trying to make a point by speaking the other language
So would someone even say "jeg likede hans billede" despite it not being a Danish word
> “Nice” becomes “najs” and “mail” becomes “mejl”.
Oh god, we do that all the time cause we use a different alphabet and such
We say "Έκανα **λαϊκ** στη φωτογραφία του" (I did a like on his picture) instead of the correct sentence in Greek, which would be "Μου άρεσε η φωτογραφία του".
We also use "μεϊλ" (mail) and "ναϊς" (nice) quite a bit (the diacritics are there because without them ει and αι are pronounced i (like **i**n) and e (like l**e**t) respectively)
I think it's quite interesting because we're basically watching the evolution of the languages as they're interacting and influencing each other in many different ways
Who knows how each language is gonna sound in the future
All languages are undergoing changes right as we *speak* (heh pun intended)
I often get `νευρικός` (angry, mad) mixed up with `nevrous`. They sound too similar and sometimes I just think it's the same word
I could probably think of a lot more but that's one I could recall off the top of my head
In Greek we use the word lose to say we have missed something
So I have often made the mistake of saying things like "I lost my bus"
I sometimes mix Greek with English because I forget some Greek words and it's easier to just use the English version
Γατα which means cat in Greek and is pronounced Gata with the g pronounced like the ll in tortilla
I sometimes confuse English and Greek and I say Catα
I don't really have that problem, I just understand english but have a lot of trouble finding the words when I try to translate, in general I forget the Greek words for it
Greek lacks many vowels that English has, which leads to Greeks mixing up words like "shit" and "sheet" or "ship" and "sheep".
I learned French back in high school so sometimes I mix up pronunciations of English with the French equivalent
I also tend to use the English term when I can't remember the Greek term, though I am trying to reduce that
I'd get that a lot less frequently back when I didn't interact with so much content in English tbh
Nope, I can't explain it correctly
I think most people think very highly of a man named γέροντας Παΐσιος (literally old man Paisios)
He was a monk living very simply
People say he predicted the future and gave out prophecies, and they attribute miracles to him
Kiriakos Mitsotakis
I'm pretty sure that is the purpose of the question
I know one girl who's the daughter of an antivaxxer
She's been practically brainwashed by her mother
I'd say no, but Facebook is a thing
So I guess they exist .. somewhere
At this point I only browse subs about Europe and some gaming subreddits because I literally have no idea what people are talking about
Even in the meme subreddits I don't know what half of the things they're referring to mean and why I should find them funny
I'm really late to the party, but sometimes I'm surprised how much American culture has influenced our own here
On the other hand, it's still so far off that most of Reddit does feel culturally distant, maybe even more so this sub, since South/East Europe is really not portrayed
Holy shit people do love cats
I think people are scared of me, I think my voice sounds angry or snobbish
Probably I'm too nervous, since I rarely speak English, yet the media I consume are mainly in English language
Athens: Gray concrete
Thessaloniki: Prettier Gray concrete
Corfu: Tourist hub, good sightseeing, nice locals
Argos is just known for being old af
Only notable thing in Athens
Well going as a tourist you're propably going to see the bright side of the city
*Italy and greece cry in ancient*
In Greece the last part of a surname is what matters
My name ends with -ellis
That means that       I am from the island of Lesbos
In Crete most surnames end with -akis
if your last name ends in -akis it means that you're from Crete and if it ends in -atos it means that you're from either Kephalonia or the Ionian islands i'm not sure
Also -idis, -adis, -oudis are from northern greece, or from the black sea
Also - poulos comes from the Peloponnese
also -atos it Kephalonian
-eas, like Rouseas, from the Mani peninsula in South Peloponnese
Giancarlo Esposito is form Naples too
Well technically yes but like, over the decades and the years this stopped being the case
My last name technically means that I come from a certain place in Greece (as in the word of that place is in my last name - for privacy I won't say it), but nobody in the family is from that place or has any connections to that place
Yes
Papas means priest
I know someone who's surname was Hadji
name I won't say for privacy
Apparently that's because someone in their family did a pilgrimage to the Holy lands, Hadj being the Muslim equivalent that got used probably cause of Turkish influence
Not sure if it's Anatolian Greek or from Greek peninsula/Greece
The word "Lesbian" originates from Lesbos due to the fact that it was the home to the 6th-century BCE poet Sappho (who is said to be the first lesbian)
And yes if you are from Lesbos and you are a woman you are called "Lesbian" (Λεσβία) in Greek but in the last 20 years or so another word is used for obvious reasons
(The joke is ongoing though - as a woman from Lesbos I've heard it many many times
I swear Will Smith is also an actual black Smith
A quite handsome black Smith if you ask me
Dame tu cosita, ay
Vittu saatana
Vaffanculo
Voules-vouz coucher avec moi
Not the cleanest stuff, to be fair
Having money
If you had 5000 drachmas(aprox
13 euros), you couldn't spend it all in a day
I know exactly what you're talking about
It feels like melancholy, in some way
That one called Utopian Land, idk the artist, idc about the artist, idk who thought this was a good idea and I think it was the first time we didn't even pass the semi-finals and rightfully so
Tbh every entry after 2014 is just a waste of resources
edit: my opinion, of course
[Unironically best song we ever sent]
Since 2014, I've liked none of our songs
Cyprus on the other hand has send songs such Gravity, Alter Ego and Fuego in this time span
They should bring public vote back
Love it or hate it, Lasha Tumbai is iconic
No it was **the best** mate
Still remember it like it was yesterday, and I was a little kid
You know what, I never imagined I'd grow up to appreciate S.A.G.A.P.O. but here I am
yup I second that
In Greece we have a tradition called Οχι day (Όχι means no in Greek) which celebrates the time where we said no to the nazis and beat them when they wanted to take over
Funny thing is, we already call it that
Its practical
I mean, you don't hear people saying "The Hellenic Republic" or "The Kingdom of Denmark"
In Greece out name is Hellas , but the official name is Hellenic Republic
I think changing the name from Czech Republic go Czechia,  because it "sounds" better , doesnt make any sense
In against it
[this one's  very  bad ass]
And the one we use now
I liked [This one] fromthe 1700
[This one] I guess (yeah I know it's not a greek flag in the traditional term)
[Kingdom Of Greece Flag] used on 1832–1924 and 1935–1973
Its a treason then
Can't unsee it
Ζήλεια (zília) / Ζήλος (zílos)
Φθόνος (fthónos)
It's a bit more complex than that though
The word for jealousy describes a state where one wishes or actively tries to get the object of desire while the word for envy describes a state where one feels sad that he that he doesn't have the very same object
Basically the difference lies on a active/passive basis
This is why φθόνος is used more rarely and not just because its archaic
E.g. when you feel jealous of someone driving a nice car you are actively working in your life to maybe one day get it as well
Ζήλια comes from ancient greek Ζήλος which means Zeal
In fact, it's obvious that both words zeal and jealousy have their root origins from ζήλος.
&#x200B;
We still use φθόνος today when we mean to be more like grim about it
Just like the song goes too:
Ποια μοίρα με ζηλεύει
Ποιο μάτι φθονερό
Και χάθηκε μια αγάπη
Προτού να τη χαρώ
Those lyrics, see, make use of both of words
The form of κάμνει το που ζήλια doesn't exist in Greece
But that's not the active/passive distinction I try to make anyway
In regards now to the negative state you're referring to haven't you heard someone say I'm on vacation and the other person saying "Oh, I'm so jealous of you"? This is more like how I'd wish to be in your place and I'm happy that you are at it
I find this more useful to be honest in every day speech
It would be interesting though if a language had all four
In general though, ζήλια can be both negative and positive while φθόνος is always negative, but passively negative
Yeah I think it is a regional deference as well
Aragonese is a language just as Occitan or Catalan are
For Athens I would definitely say off the top of my head:
-Tourism industry, because of its rich history
-shipping (Port of Pireaus is like one of the largest in Europe)
After a Google search I found out that we also have
-a pretty big software development industry
-insurance industry
According to Wikipedia :
>Multinational companies such as Ericsson, Sony, Siemens, Motorola, Samsung, Microsoft, Novartis, Mondelez, Coca-Cola, etc
have their regional research and development headquarters also there
And also major Greek companies
But overall I hope Athens would be better for business etc
No not really, in the cities there is everyone but farmers (they are on the rest of regions near the big city)
Yes in Athens we tend to attract people who want to find a job
I would add Athens to history
It's the only thing our city is good at don't take it away from us
lol
Edit: okay I was exaggerating a little bit, we actually have a few things to brag or to be proud about our capital
They partially made it since they hold part of it
In Greece it's commonly referred to as the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine, but media usually shorten it as the Pfizer vaccine
I got my second dose a few days ago and on my vaccination certificate it says:
"Biontech Manufacturing GmbH, Germany"
Everyone knows "Biontech" created it, although everyone calls it by its distributor "Pfizer" simply because it's an easier and shorter name
ευχαριστώ (), thank you (), danke (), gracias (), tak (), takk (), merci (), grazie (), kiitos (), спасибо ()
I think that's all
English: Thank you
Greek: Ευχαριστώ (Efharisto)
Spanish: Gracias
French: Merci
German: Dankeschon
Russian (it's spoken in several parts of Europe): спасибо (spasiba)
Italian: Grazie
6 off the top of my head
No you aint wrong,its written " eucharisto "  but pronounced as  " efcharisto "
Same word , different spelling, Greek is weird :p
Quantum mechanics
They have good research going on
A country close to Indonesia and Malaysia
There's more to my country than ancient stuff and islands
Specifically German is known for its ability to take any words and construct a huge composite word, we can absolutely do the same in Greek, and do it pretty often (well ok, maybe not that often, but you can)
Its not all islands, we have mountains, and velouchi water, better than any other water ive seen
That's so dope
We can't do and haven't been doing it to that extent though
Indeed, any visual representation of my country is either of something ancient or of an island
Well we have the Acropolis
And Santorini too
But I'm basically talking about the modern arts and literature Greece has to offer
aaand it's done
Yeah I'm sure there are, I didn't say it's only German and Greek, it's just that I've never seen anyone mention that you can do that in other languages, and whenever I've seen a fact about being able to do it in German, they usually say it as if it's exclusive to that language
Well yeah true not sure why I said we do it *often", but wdym we can't? Μπορείς να πεις καρεκλοποδαροβρωμοκαλτσομαλακας (ότι μου ερχόταν στο μυαλό τώρα), αυτό δεν είναι που κάνουν και στα γερμανικά;
I'm loving this game we're playing
Duuuude
why stay there
There's so many landscapes that hardly look like your stereotypical Greek landscape
Especially in the mainland
Wow that's so amazing
Yes we sure can say that, but they have more words that they actually also use more often on their daily lifes, that are composite words
Μένω σε γερμανόφωνη χώρα και μου έχει κάνει εντύπωση αυτό
We would have an epic final together
I wanna see a swearing contest between an Italian, a Pole, a Serb and a Greek
You forgot Greece
In Greece there was "Κόμμα Ελλήνων Κυνηγών" = Party of Greek Hunters (Nature-Hunting-Fishing-Tradition) for the last 25 years . Mostly represented the rights of hunters and fishermen . At European Parliament Elections at 2014 took \~57000 votes (1%) ,  but didn't take part at any following elections .
Ok not exactly weird, but I find this funny af
We have our main Communist party ΚΚΕ (initials for "communist party of Greece"), but there are two more that are called:
ML KKE (Marxist Leninist KKE, same initials for KKE), and
KKE ML (KKE Marxist Leninist)
These are two very different and rather rival parties
Where do I sign up
Belgium
I categorize it as the smallest non small country
Indonesia, it's pretty freaking big, no one really thinks that just cause it's an island
The Czech Republic
In what exactly
Its not
Its the same memes repeating every month or so with some extra ones occasionally
Im starting to think some dude in his moms basement, experimenting on human behavior, is the one feeding this vicious circle
Same for /r/AmItheAsshole etc
I don't think cups and teaspoons/tablespoons are American measurements, we have them here too
The ingredients on the other hand
I mean marshmallow fluff
Oyster sauce
I'm lucky if I can find marshmallows to melt on my own
North Greece, we went to the Royal Macedonian tombs at Aiges, basically small hills that covered fancy burial places, got to see the bones, ceremonial armour and gold of Phillip II which was pretty dope
Love ancient history nowadays and I'd love to go back
I'm from Crete so the first trip that was memorable to me was in middle school when we took the overnight ship and went to Athens to do what every tourist does in Athens eg go to the Parthenon, the museum of acropolis etc needless to say we had a blast
Another memorable trip was in the last year of high school where we went a trip to Central Europe (Czech rep
, Germany, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria)
The internet, friend groups and the occasional bio teacher who also doesnt trust vaccines
Greece's second largest city, Thessaloniki, had such an important and numerous Jewish community that it was nicknamed [mother of Israel] with jews making up at least one third of the total population until the start of the 20th century
Then the nazi occupation happened
[Also apparently we came very close to having the same flag with Finland]
On 2 October, 1920 prince Alexandros of Greece was bit by a monkey while trying to break up a fight between her and his dog, Fritz
The bite was not taken care of properly and became infected
As a result he died two days later
This caused a series of events that eventually led to the defeat of Greece in the Asia Minor Expedition, and the deaths of millions of Anatolian Christians
I always find it strange that even though Russians never lost in Russia due to the harsh winter, they got decimated in Finland because of the fucking winter
In Greek we don't really ever use the pronouns _I, you, he/she/it, we, you, they_  since it can already be recognised by the word's ending
But from what I have seen, learners of the Greek language do actually use them
I don't know Latin, basically like in Spanish
i love them because they all have some meaning behind them and most of them have some Ancient origin, for example
my town's name is Artemis (from the goddess)
but originaly i am from Heraklion (from hercules)
Yeah, there are also cities all over the Mediterranean with Greek origin
For example:
Naples>Neápolis(new city)
Monaco>mónikos(one house/family)
Yeah and it's the 5th (technically 6th) largest city in Greece
The name definitely is Greek but I don't know what it means, I googled it and apparently the Greeks that colonized that place (from phocaea) had a habit of starting the names of cities with Massa but thats it
(Also to this day the Greek name for Marseilles is massalia)
Pella was always the capital of Macedonia even under Alexander the Great, today it's just a village with a lot of history
Yeah but I think Sparta can qualify as a city
Greece has plenty of material for this, hundreds of little islands in the middle of the sea count
Western Macedonia and Eastern Thrace to the north are quite sparsely populated so they are out of the average Greek's mind
But
running along the spine of Greece is the Pindus mountain range that's quite big and empty
On the southern side of it there's an area called 'Agrafa', literally translated to 'Unwritten' but more accurately 'Unregistered' or 'Uncharted'. It's an area completely surrounded by 2000m mountains, and the river of the area exits through impassable gorges
It's named so because during the 400-500 years of Turkish occupation of Greece, they never bothered or managed to conquer Agrafa and so the area wasn't included in the Sultan's tax register, and the people lived freely in the mountains
Nowdays the Agrafa mountains are very sparsely populated, my dad's been, there's only a few tiny villages high up with at most a single coffee shop or something and mountain tops
we have so many islands so it's not the sea
the mountains on the other side
Gavdos island
The southernmost place in Europe
As soon as you fly to Athens, you need another 45’ flight to one of the cities of Crete island (or 8h ferry), another ~2h drive to a small town south of Crete and another 4h ferry, which you can only catch 2-3 times a week if you are lucky and it’s not very windy
Huh, didn't know it had a name
Hadn't realised just how hilly Central Wales is until I cycled through it, was deadly
I think urbanization is a global phenomenon but it's also the case for Greece, where young people and in general people move from small cities to the urban centers like Athens or Thessaloniki
It has been the case for a while already
well that used to happen but now it's actually the other way around now
for the duration of the past century everyone was moving to the capital or the "co-capital" aka Thessaloniki to the point where i live near the capital and i've never met anyone who's grandparents were born and raised in the capital, all my grandparents were born in Crete and moved to Athens except my dads mom that was born in in Smyrna
now everyone is moving back to other slightly big towns like Patras, Chania, Heraklion and so on
It has been the case with Greece the last 30-40 years
Approx
half of the total greek population lives in Athens Metropolitan Area
Some years ago in a reality show, there was a guy who introduced himself as a rugby coach
The whole population was like "we have rugby in Greece
I would be very surprised if even 1% of my countryman knew how it's played
Me included
Not popular at all
I don't even know if we have a team but I can tell you that rugby is known as the american sorry excuse for a sport
You can buy milk which lasts a long time (like, more than half a year) and you don't have to put in the fridge unless you open it, then it has to be refrigerated
It's usually sold either condensed in an airtight tin or not condensed (i guess) which is sold in an airtight carton
I used to drink the tinned milk at my grandma's house when I was little and I'd sometimes put it in my coffee as a young adult
That being said, most people prefer "fresh" milk, which has to be kept in the fridge both in store and at home and will last anywhere from a week to a month depending on it's pasteurization
As for eggs, they are usually not in the fridge when in store but we refrigerate them at home if we don't intend on using them all within the next day or two
Eggs are not refrigerated untill we brought them home
Milk is refrigerated
it's perfectly normal here if there's a lot left to eat, but usually people aks for the main dishes only and not the sides
Fun fact, it's also pretty normal to ask for any leftover bones when eating meat to give them to your dog
We Greeks tend to order a lot when eating out (many appetizers in the middle for all to share, often along with main dishes for each individual)
In most of the cases, something will definitely be left uneaten
In taverns and traditional restaurants, it is pretty common to ask them to wrap up the leftovers so that you can take them home
I usually also take the little bottle of ouzo with me, if it has not been emptied
However, you wouldn't ask the same if you dined in a gourmet restaurant
Then again, rarely you would order more than you could eat at the time in such restaurants, as they are pricey (and their portions are not really big)
Not at all
In tavernas we always order too much ( I mean you would too with the great food that they serve)
Most people in Greece do that actually and most places will offer to pack your food so you can take it home
No, not at all, even in upscale restaurants
If a server sees your plate half full or more, they will probably ask you if you want to take the rest home
no some times they'll even ask you if you want a little box to take it home with, it's considered a "sin" to throw away food
My mom does this every time as well
She always finds either stray cats or dogs to feed them the leftovers
We have standard qwerty but next to the Latin letters there are Greek and you switch alphabets with shift+alt
[like this]
Oh the azerty keyboard fucked me up when I had put a password when creating my work email
I was at the IT guy's office, and I typed the password thinking im typing in qwerty
So, as you can imagine, the password i thought I wrote, was completely different than the one I actually typed
When we were setting up my desk, I requested a qwerty keyboard
So when I tried to access my account from my desk, I couldn't get in
So I thought maybe my account is not yet available
Thankfully I revisited the IT guy for something else that day, I noticed his keyboard and had an epiphany
Damn you azerty keyboard
Greece, I mean the Turks still call us Rum (Romans), how based is that
Byzantium is the name of an ancient Greek colony of the city state of Megara, named after their king, Byzantas, and the site Constantinople was build on
It was during the time that the seat of power of the Catholics was moved from the Vatican to France that the historians of the time were instructed to rename East Roman Empire to Byzantium for a number of reasons (Orthodox faith, being mostly Greek, outside of the Pope's influence etc)
Not all adopted the change though, countries like UK and Turkey still use the original name
I remember a law that was supposed to ban somoking inside bars, cafés ect (it was passed in 2010, I think)
That law had so many loopholes and was enforced (for lack of a better word) library, meaning that not only did it not ban smoking in closed public places as it was supposed to but it actually made it perfectly legal
The government literally shot itself in the foot and gave the middle finger to all us non-smokers
It would start with moro mou and end with moro mou, atleast that's what most everyone under 45 would say
I have to admit that I absolutely love all the Turkish affectionate words
More than the S/O related, I love the words used when family members express love to each other
For context I am pontic Greek, so my family and especially my grandmother often use words (or to be precise their pontic Greek equivalents which sound similar) like yavrum, çıkar, ciğer
There are no words that sound sweeter than those
I was wondering why I kept burning them when I tried to cook them
Thanks
The common accent from Athens is just considered normal
The accent of Macedonia is considered beautiful but also funny
The dialects of Thessaly are considered rude and uneducated
The Patras dialect is considered somehow aggressive, but nice
The dialect of Epirus is considered funny
The dialects of Rhodes, Cyprus and Lesbos are considered funny
The dialects of Crete are considered very masculine and it's very sexy for a man to speak it, but not for a woman
In Greece it's a bit different
The athenian accent is not really consider an accent, but the proper way to speak Greek
Obviously, people from other places might disagree with that, but it is somewhat true because it's a really unflavored way to speak; it doesn't skip letters, or highlight them excessively, etc
The cretan and the Thessaloniki accent are generally seen as positive
The ones from rural places have negative connotations
The Cyprus one is like speaking greek with an italian accent (at least to me)
It's polarizing, people love it or hate it
No posh accent, really
It's mostly the athenian one in the media, except from Cyprus of course, where they use their own
Well Greek accents usually brings the topic of place of origin
But foreign accents are treated as enthusiastic tourists trying to learn our language but if it's from the Balkans or Hindi and Pakistani they are treated as lower people for some reason
So, technically every accent except Instabulite is considered uneducated
Never even thought about it until now
I would say it's the same in Greece
We are very group oriented in general and people kind of pity you and thunk you have no friends to go out with
And keep staring until they get creeped out and leave
Then follow them
Sounds like free enterprise to me
But these things also happen in 'non-oppressive' regimes such as many democracies of the EU
Both from police and uniformed thugs and private thugs
Kokoretsi
It's lungs, liver and spleen wrapped with intestines and people go nuts about it
Me personally, I don't even enjoy the smell of it
Hey we have something similar too
I like it, as long as the meat is good and it's seasoned properly
Not everyone likes to be hit with liver flavour
My citizenship should be taken away because I fucking hate this stuff
Same with mageirítsa on easter, and don't even get me started on the smelliness of feta
Tavuk Gogsu is the shit
You can also find lamb souvlaki, its just not that common cause its more expensive
We have 18,here is a [list]
Call it selfishness, but I really overestimated how many sites Greece would have
16 of them are cultural
2 of them are both cultural and natural
The ongoing war among  North and  South Greece on how to call the bbq pork skewer
In Athens, it is called kalamaki (which also means plastic straw everywhere in Greece) and in Thessaloniki; souvlaki
By souvlaki Athenians mean gyros in greek pita bread with different toppings
In Thessaloniki for the same dish they say (pita) gyros
There's a nationwide debate on whether ground beef belongs in Gemista (peppers and tomatoes filled with rice [and ground beef])
I can't imagine myself eating them without ground beef
Well in North Greece and most islands people call [this] a Souvlaki and [this] a sandwich
While on central Greece (mainly Athens) we call the first one Kalamaki and the second one Souvlaki
(Kalamaki means small cane cause the sticks are made from cane and Souvlaki is a small souvla)
In Athens souvlaki is a general term, it applies to both kalamaki and pitogyro
There are also many battles in this war, for example sauce vs aloife and pitogyro vs sandwich
We have to unite our forces for the enemy is common; people who only eat patatopita
Eww why would you put meat
It ruins it
Keep ground beef out of gemista
It's confusing for the natives as well hahahaha
I'm from the North and whenever a friend from Athens or other places from the South tells me they ordered gyros I always double check what they mean
Never  knew it could be a name of an album
Edit: spelling
Noooo, I love patatopita with tzatziki or turokauteri
But **just** that
Forever
That'd be scary dude
Not forever, Panagitsa mou, but sometimes it's really nice
My enemies are those who order and exclude onions, tomatoes or mustard/ketchup
Hellas, because Greece was an insult centuries ago
Greek I believe comes from the word Graecus and ancient Greek tribe and it's patron
But it was used heavily in ottoman times
[Graecus- greek]
As for the political party and it's supporters they are on trial for organised crimes now and noone uses their symbols and agenta
To our actual name "Hellas"
Finally someone said it
Enough with the graikos think it's been 199 years since Independence , I think that's enough time to forget that awful name
Nahh Turkland sounds too basic
My head connects it with hibernation and then the fact that you're at the edge of Europe and nothing significant ever happens in Ireland
For some reason my dad still manages to mix up Sweden and Switzerland even though they sound completely different in Greek (Σουηδία & Ελβετία)
Beag in Irish, Bach in Welsh
Yup, and that area of North England and South Scotland used to be called "Yr hen ogledd" the old North" in medieval Welsh poetry etc because it lost the language later than the rest of what became England
That translates to "the Greeks". Would be E-li-nes
They might even think Cumbria is part of wales again who knows
I'm Greek it's Πορτογαλία/Portogalia, while France is Gallia, and the colour orange is πορτοκάλι/portocali
Little child me thought Portugal was the orange France
why
Dimitri is most common in Greece and Slavic nations
I'm a Greek with Slavic roots and it's also my name, lol
Are Alexei and Aleksandr different names
Not a variant of the same one
Of course we do, I personally try to avoid big logos since I'm not a walking advertisement and they are probably not appropriate for formal occasions but other than that
Depends on the logo, I can only speak for greece though
I personally try to avoid logos, but small logos that aren't too on the nose like a small ralph lauren logo in the corner of your shirt isn't a big deal, almost everyone wears shirts that might have a small non-intrusive logo
But unless you're a 14yo tiktoker hypebeast, people tend to avoid shirts with big/flex-y logos, but I thought that was the case evrywhere (?)
So basically, what I mean is that small non intrusive logos are very normal, but it sometimes can seem weird if you wear a shirt with huge branding with some small exception
Oversized english language lettering on t-shirts is a surefire way to identify eastern Europeans (Russians, Ukrainians etc)
Americans will have t-shirts with lettering but it will 'make sense' - like it will just be a free t-shirt from some organization etc
Speaking from many many summers of experience in playing "guess the tourist" in Greece
Turkey
It used to be one of the countries which i wanted to visit but since the 2016 coup i want to avoid that country in every cost
Even my family boycotts Turkish products now and they rarely boycott anything
Also Hungary & Poland
Both countries are getting worse and worse by each day with their regimes
And honourable mention my country Greece
I used to be proud for my country but since the Economic Crisis not so much
Switzerland
The animosity and coldness of the people is insufferable
Mate Athens is pretty much the worst possible example of a Greek city
It's just 4 million people packed together in grey apartments (although the metro system us quite clean and organized)
I believe that Thessaloniki and mostly northern Greece are in better conditions
Ah lol, most Greek redditors and really Athenians like me in general will agree with you
I would say projection is the same with just about every European capital, like I felt the same when I visited Berlin, although it sounds like I had a better impression of it than you had of Athens
OTOH have to admit when I visited Dresden I was pleasantly surprised, it felt a bit more like a "German city" if that makes sense (sorry to German folks if this perspective sounds stupid)
All these cities are advertised the same way by packing ads (whether they're videos or posters or w/e) with monuments or historic centers, but there's no city that is *just* that
IIRC this is a Thing with Paris specifically, the Japanese have a word for it or smth
Unfortunately Athens had the possibility to become a beautiful city, but there were decades of the construction sector trying to fill the city with apartment buildings to sell
All buildings are grey ugly boxes, newer ones often have short ceilings so they can fit more floors to sell
Affluent or older neighborhoods that are untouched are beautiful but the greater mass is ugly
Also not as many parks so too little green in a sea of grey
The problem is not that you consider it ugly (find one Greek person who thinks otherwise about the city), the problem is that you found this post-apocalyptic mess of a capital romantic to begin with lol
Athens is a grey concrete jungle
The things worth visiting in Athens are almost all of historic and archaelogical value
Reminds me of the way some people believe that Greece is full of little blue and white houses near the beach and it's always sunny and over 15°C lol
Thank you
I can't stress this enough, if you're planning on visiting Greece, focus on the north
Athens is just
ugly
Not that Thessaloniki is any prettier
My suggestions mostly consist of the smaller northern ~~cities~~ towns, like Kavala, Kastoria, Edessa, Drama
I'm in love with all four
Lots of people do, for some reason
It's mostly due to tourism marketing
It's important to contribute to the spread of tourism in Greece to places other than Mykonos, Santorini, Athens and Crete, imo
That utopian image of Sweden has gotten into the minds of pretty much everyone here in Greece
I mean, it's a beautiful country, but over-the-top romanticization isn't a healthy mindset
Our relationship has always been troubled but there were attempts to leave everything behind
The last years have been horrible though
The ever-present possibility of a much stronger country declaring war on yours, led by an authoritarian lunatic is really really bad
Especially because I am a male of fighting age
We don't really hate each other as much as non-Turks and non-Greeks like to imagine
The people of both countries get along with each other pretty well; it's the politics that's kinda heated
Well Greece hit a ROCK bottom in every single thing since the crisis
Especially in 2010-2015 we were the biggest laughing of Europe and also the most hated European country and then people started to get the impression that Greece is like Venezuela or Syria which is not true
Thanks to Brexit and Orban we are no longer the most embarrassing EU country anymore but Greece is still a hot mess and it's still doubtful if we will ever recover from the 2008 crisis
man, we only hang out in the suburbs because it's nice there
Me and basically everyone else I know who lives in the suburbs avoid hanging out in the centre of Athens at all costs because it's ugly af
Obviously, I am not speaking for everyone rn, but for the younger generations this is becoming more and more of a trend
Based on my perception, crime depends on the line
Red and Blue are ok; the green one is a nightmare in every way
Athens is still full of life and good food, don't get me wrong
However if you'd been to Thessaloniki first, then the sheer size and density of the capital will be a shock to you
I wouldn't say disappointed, there are still many attrcations and beautiful places there
Yeah agreed
As another comment said, Berlin felt
"un-German" somehow, it wasn't as clean and orderly as I expected - Dresden was that and much more beautiful too in contrast
I've been to the Acropolis in the past year more times than most people ever do and I got my fill of it in a sense, it's incredibly awe-inspiring to me but it's... oppressive relative to the marketing of Athens
This is in part why people especially on /r/greece always recommend if you visit Greece for a week, take a couple of days in Athens at most then spend the rest on an island or more generally *not in a city
Same in Thessaloniki
My whole circle is from the northeastern suburbs and we just love to hang out there and avoid the city centre at all costs, unless we wanna smoke some hookah or something, which is unreasonably expensive in the suburbs (lots of mainstream lounge/coffee shop owners in the suburbs really think they're someone important and keep raising their prices lol)
Hmm depends on the crime though, I think pickpocketing is pretty common in all lines; I'm not saying it to be negative, just cause awareness is the key to avoiding it
Like, in Munich I got so damn shocked about how people wore their backpacks on, uhm, their back on the metro
Here it'd feel like wanting to get something stolen, idk, I always bring my bag up front and mind the zippers
Btw, no worries, as most said, most Athenians feel the same way about the city, despite liking it or not
I think Greece is not really big on the "beautiful big cities" part tbh, villages / islands / smaller cities are much more worth imo
Hahaha yeah exactly the same here in Athens, although we do have some good places for hookah in the suburbs too, but some of them are just borderline scams tbf
Good kowalski analysis
Nah, i don't really care
Never really thought about that but since my language was once the lingua franca i have no reason to be salty lmao
Italy: They have better stuff to deal right now tbh
Albania: Sometimes
North Macedonia: In the past yes but now not really
Bulgaria: Nah
Turkey: Y E S
Cyprus: Does their really low quality soap operas count
(Greek soap operas are not much better either anyway)
Well Turkey violates our airspace and open refugees to our border so yeah
Mush beans
Yikes
I never felt in no way threatened by our Italian brothers
Not Albania,North Macedonia, or Bulgaria are nations that threaten us in no way
North Macedonia has an insignificant army with Soviet era equipment
Bulgaria and Albania more or less in the same situation
I don't think we should be fear either by Turkey
That tricked they pulled in Evros failed miserably
how could albania even do anything to us
Or he just doesn't have an interest in destabilising Bulgaria
I heard the Greek minority there is pretty oppressed
Plus if i remember correctly their prime minister said some negative things about Greece in the past but still not as much as in Turkey
I don't hate Albania anyway and definitely i didn't supported Katsifas and his likes
Oh yeah, i agree with you
I thought you were talking about invasions and stuff my bad
My grandmother could speak [Arvanitika] My mother understands a little, but me none
Personally, I've never met anyone in Greece under the age of 60 that can speak it
It's fairly mutually intelligible with standard Albanian though
Pontic Greek, which is a soon-to-be obsolete dialect of Greek, spoken primarily on the coasts of Black Sea (Pontus), in present-day Turkey
Most of the people speaking it today are descendants of Greek refugees that fled Turkey back in the 20's, living in Greece, Russia, Georgia
Well the Republic of Cyprus even has a [Turkish Cypriot MEP]
We really should stop blaming others (like the EU) for all our problems
It ain't 400 BC anymore
We are xenophobic, philoxenia is still just that, treating someone like a foreigner
Debt
To be fair, it's not like we aren't blaming ourselves
Ok so, first of all
Claiming that the **vast** majority of Greek people don't blame the way things are handled internally **first** and foremost is to say the least disingenuous
And you should know this unless you are not living in Greece
Second of all, to say that there is no blame to be put on outside factors (meaning the EU among others) is also just blatantly false
You can choose to use nuance when it comes to certain topics or you can choose to just blatantly pander like you are doing
Ελεος με το γλειψιμο πια και την καραμελα οτι οι Ελληνες ειναι οι κακοι της υποθεσης που κατηγορουν αδικα την αθωα ΕΕ που δε μας εκανε ποτε τιποτα. Σε αλλη χωρα ζεις ή ζεις τελειως στον κοσμο σου και δεν εχεις καταλαβει τι εχει γινει την τελευταια δεκαετια?
If it offers you any comfort, our man Xenophon wrote a whole ass book about your guy Cyrus, and also Aeschylus wrote a play titled "The Persians", unique among ancient Greek plays because it was based on real life people, rather than myths
You better bet no one ever wrote a play "The Ottomans".
>Claiming that the **vast** majority of Greek people don't blame
Never wrote such thing
Feel free to point where I wrote that
You are the one that did
Go on
>And you should know this unless you are not living in Greece
I am in fact living here, my whole life
What I actually get from this is "You're obviously not from here if you don't see things the way I do".
>Second of all, to say that there is no blame to be put on outside factors (meaning the EU among others) is also just blatantly false
Again, may you please point out where exactly I wrote that the EU is completely innocent and blameless
If that's your own interpretation of what I wrote, it is no fault of mine
In this case, stop projecting
What you think I meant is not necessarily what I actually meant
>You can choose to use nuance when it comes to certain topics or you can choose to just blatantly pander like you are doing
And you can choose to read what I actually wrote instead of getting mad at something you made up in your mind:  We really should stop blaming others (like the EU) for **all** our problems
That's it
If you think the others, like the EU for example, is to blame for every single thing, which was what I wrote, is just stupid
Emphasis on ***all***, and the EU is just an example of those blamed
I did not write "We are to blame for everything about the crisis, and the poor EU did nothing wrong", which is what your understood
What I wrote was "We have a tendency to blame others for our problems, and the EU is one of those 'others', among others". Just this
I was not even referring to the economic crisis exclusively
I did not even write that the EU is the only one that is ever blamed
I wrote it as an example
Basic reading skills
Thanks for proving my point
Wish I could say the same for us
Being kind to foreigners
Kindness yes, but still treating them as foreigners
Ασε μας ρε ξεφτιλα που μου απαντας και στα αγγλικα
Ευχαριστώ που απέδειξες το επιχείρημά μου.
Το ποιο? Εγραψες καποιο επιχειρημα? Γιατι εγω μονο την προσωπικη σου αποψη βλεπω.
They already have but man would a byzantine assassin be great
Well I'm lucky enough to have AC Odyssey so Im satisfied
They already made Revelations and Odyssey
I am more font of our Roman past than anything before 146 BC so I would like something during the Arab-Byzantine wars
The War of Independence would be interesting as well, naval battles, land battles, drama, the lot
That is if I cared about the series, I lost interest since '12
You bet
The first that comes to mind is choryátis/a (χωριάτης/α) witch literally means villager, countryman
The other is cáguras (κάγκουρας) referring to someone who behaves like a bum, has poor speaking skills, doesn't abide by the rules and usually owns a scooter/motorbike
In addition to that he still lives at his parents because he doesn't work
The other is clarinogambrós (κλαρινογαμπρός) literally meaning clarinet groom
He is the evolution of the cánguras
The difference between the two is that this version has more money and spends it all buying Moët in night clubs
He also pays a lot to get his hair and beard done so that he can get laid easier
Κάγκουρες (Kagures)
Malakes
Rock, disco and the usual Greek folk/entehno stuff
Generally the 70s, 80s & 90s are the most beloved decades in terms of Greek music here
Sometimes those 3 decades are also called as the Golden decades of Greek music scene by the Greeks
+1 for entehno
The Cypriots speak Greek and we still cannot understand what they are saying
Y'all have so similar languages my language is its own family
If you count Tsakonian as a different language from Greek, then I can say that I can't understand a single word of it
Greek Cypriots basically turn sentences into long, melodic-sounding words, so there's some trouble understanding them
My fluency in English and my little knowledge of German allowed me to **partially** understand the north Germanic languages (except for Icelandic) before I got to learn Danish
I still can't make any sense of Icelandic and Dutch, though
I believe I would understand around 70% of cypriot Greek perhaps more if they spoke slowly
And I can understand 90% of the cretan, pontus and other Greek dialects
Same goes for people from villages in crete
If you get exposed to the cypriot dialect then you'll understand them :)
I would say that people outside of Athens don't have a big problem understanding what they are  saying, especially in Rhodes where they speak a similar way
It's also the same for every place in Greece that is not Athens :p
Good ol' cup o' hemlock
It's summer, we are on vacation
We don't kill anyone
But if we did, it would be by a firing squad or hanging
The death penalty was officially abolished in Greece, in the 90's I think but the last person executed was in the early 70's.
Financial Crisis
i'd say most students and young people can hold a conversation because it's treated as mandatory for you future when growing up
i've only ever met 2 people over the age of 40 that know english, one was my english teacher and a Greek that grew up in Canada and came back
We don't do that at all
Not even in universities, which are supposed to accept and encourage foreign students
Bear in mind that the syllabus mentions that several courses (to the lecturer's discretion) may be offered in English
Best part, this professor in my uni had two students from Cameroon once and I'm the first class asked them: " are you more comfortable with English or French
" To which the students said French was more comfortable to them but they were happy with English
So the prof literally said "Bon" (which I think is good in French
) and proceeded to give the entire lecture in Greek
Yeah basically
I dont
think so
There are these pesky turks that like to pretend that they are a separate nation and that Constantinople is named *Istanbul* of all things,while they are sitting in their anchor, but they'll learn
Ι really wanna see a Kurdish country,i dont care if that will be in Turkey Iraq nor Syria
I think any culture group needs hes own nation
(no offense)
Gr8 b8 m8
I know but Kurdistan in particular is a really realistic idea, they are 30 million worldwide they need their own nation
You just made me realise I don't know the difference between a pigeon and a dove either
And they're both called peristéri in Greek
There is not much to identify with citywise, I only use this information when I want to speak about a specific thing that is relevant to my city
I identify more with the country
I don't like the word nation much because in Greece it has been used to promote racism against non Greeks (not the word's fault, but now the damage is done for me)
Nation way more
My family doesn't have a long history in my current area as they moved her after fleeing the Ottoman Empire's/Turkey's genocide of Christian populations
(Armenian and Hellenic genocides)
There is nothing to be proud of really
We still have some teasing rivalry amongst us but it's not too much of a deal
We were a neighborhood of 6-7 kids, in a dirt road with plenty trees around
We would climb trees and claim them as our own and naming them (the best will for ever be Black scorpion) and find random wood planks and stuff and build small houses
mostly playing football
a couple of video games (as an old head I hail from the amstrad, commodore 64 days) and TV
That sounds like you had an amazing childhood
Which part of Greece are you from
Haha we didn't have many other kids around but we would fight each other with anything we could throw
At first it was olives but we emptied all the olives in the area so we moved on to stones until I got one to the face and our parents forced us to stop
Eastern coast of Attica
"world" is literally unpronounceable
"Girl/girlfriend" and "literally" are also words I struggle with
•waltz
•rural
•world
•roar
From the top of my head, that is
If I actually sit down and take a good look at my english books, ohhhh boy
I think it has to do with how vowels in english are really soft, while in greek they are power itself
Some wrong pronunciations that I have heard over the years and find extremely funny are: choir (tsoh-eer), island (is+land, which makes no sense bc it's not land), cigarette (ts-igarette) and picture (peek-tu-reh)
Keep in mind that these were said by people who know ther English and either had passed or were about to give English exams for the C2 (proficiency) certificate
for me it is the shit - sheet , beach - bitch and all the similar ones
For the love of me  and even though my mom grew up in Australia so I was raised listening to English , I cannot pronounce them correctly
Also, greek words in English
Like unconsciously I am pronouncing them the greek way
And lastly the thick sh sound like in English, I had to consciously remember to pronounce the "heavy " sh until it became a habit
Surprised no one mentioned the word “ubiquitous”. Should just be me
Literally all these words are Greek
Even parenthesis that the guys are talking about in that other comment
Γ'ρλντ :D
Greeks like our vowels hard and distinct, not whatever that quarter-beat tiple cross between an -e, an -o and an -u is at the start of that word
Fun fact: There's no way to differenciate between "nt" and "d" or "mp" and "b" in greek writing and I think greeks generally have a terrible ear for discriminating between certain consonant sounds
For example, surely no native greek speaker considers the world "train" to be unpronouncable, but we'll pronounce it almost like "drain" 100% of the time, because the starting 't' just doesn't quite map on greek 'tau', and thinking of single consonants as a spectrum of sounds just feels weird
I came here to say "world".
Meanwhile I struggle in not pronouncing the "h"s in spanish
So basically "ruuul"
Yep that word can generally point you at the nationality of the person saying it lol
That's clever but it's biologically impossible for me to not pronounce every letter lol
As a Greek this is totally easy for me to say
I would believe same goes for Spaniards
It’s the transfer, I don’t even know how to pronounce them correctly in English
But any way I say it, I have the best excuse “it’s Greek and that’s how we pronounce it ”
The shrug is mandatory
Scotland, similar kilt like outfits, both of our national animals are mythical beings (Greece has two national animals, the Dolphin and the Phoenix), one of our ethnic instruments is bagpipe related (tsampouna is popular with island folk), both country flags are white and blue with very similar shades
I haven't been to Mexico but the impression I'm getting from popular culture seems that it seems like Greece
Most if not all the Mediterranean and Balkan countries
Italians, the Spanish and the Portuguese just have this familiar aura about them that makes me feel like I'm meeting someone from my country
And well, we share a religion with most of the Balkans and from what I've seen many traditions and customs as well
Hell, even our houses, our neighborhoods and our entire towns look similar
Edit; And Ireland as well
They're the only northerners I can personally relate to
I guess our personalities kinda match
I don't know how to describe it, but we get along pretty well
I remember having an Irish classmate in primary school and he knew more about Greece than I did
It honestly surprised me, but in the good way
Japan
The have many words that sound modern Greek(like the aki ending)
And also some of their meat dishes I have tried remind me of European cuisine
The Balkans and Russia
Beautiful landscape
Beautiful beaches
Rich History
Great Food
And when we're drunk we act the same
We also have random sand dunes on an island
Excluding Meteora, I guess probably that
Here in Greece, for public education at least
The ministry of education has made it standard to use Cisco webex for web conferencing and a custom made platform for asynchronous  tasks, such as assignments(which works 100% of the time, only some of the time)
In the International Hellenic University in Greece we're only using Zoom
In my university we have a plethora of different apps and platforms that we use
It's basically up to whoever is doing the course to pick a platform
* Courses with a large audience are being done on the University's streaming platform
The lectures are livestreamed and later uploaded on the same site for people who couldn't watch them live
They are being recorded from my department's auditoriums with professional cameras and all
The problem is that students cannot interact with the professors in real time, so some professors host a q&a session once a week on Skype or Zoom
As for the rest, you can send them an email and pray they reply (Greek university professors are notorious for avoiding questions from students)
* The courses with a smaller audience (10-25 students) are done via Skype for Business/Zoom/Webex
* Unfortunately, a couple of professors don't even bother with any of it
They just upload their slides and/or notes on eclass and that's it
Zoom for afternoon classes
Regular school has started up again, though not like before
In University of Athens we use WebEx and Skype Business
I can only think of:
\- Καμένα Βούρλα(kamena vurla) = Burned bulrushes , but bulrush is metaphorically (and most commonly) used as 'stupid', so overall it translates like 'burned stupid people'
\- Της γριάς το πήδημα (tis yrias to pithima) = The old lady's fuck ... or 'the old lady's jump'; pithima means both
\- Πάπαρι (papari)=doesn't mean anything, but put the emphasis on the 2nd syllable and, voilà, 'a bollock'
Compared to all others tho, damn
can't think of any, all are cool ancient names
We have the island of Lesbos
We have a place called Malakasa
Probably the Mati fires from 2018
People had built illegal fences for their homes which made getting to the beach like a maze and the people in the fires couldn't get out in time
Some old man started the fire by burning weeds in his garden
Also the fire department was confused as to what was going on because the entire town was burned down in 1 hour
As far as sea accidents go, there was the [Falkonera Shipwreck] in the 60's. From a total of 200 passengers and crew only 50 survived (some accounts mention the fatalities as high as 270, due to no passengers list back then and the ability, to issue tickets on board),. A lorry was parked towards the ship's door, without any safety measures
They just put some stops in front of its back wheels
Due to really bad weather and big waves, the lorry fell on the ships door and it opened
The deadliest, was back in 1947, the Chimaira shipwreck
320 dead people
As far as auto accidents go, the worst, involved a [bus full of teenagers] returning to their homes from a 3 days school trip and a lorry that was illegally carrying [novopan] Many factors where involved, all of them due to human errors and greed
Firstly, the accident happend in [Vale of Tempe] which had (back then) one of the worst national roads that Greece had
Imagine, two lanes without anything to seperate them and full of blind turns, due to the physiology of the landscape
Secondly, the lorry was overloaded, with bad wheels and a driver that hasn't rest for days
He tried to take a turn, the bus was coming and the novopan went [flying over to the bus] Out of the 47 students (Ages 16-17) the 21 died, horribly
Then there was the [Karaiskakis Stadium Disaster]
Wildfires near Athens in 2018 that cause the death of 102 people
The area had no urban plan of construction so when the need to evacuate arrised, roads where blocked and people where trapped inside house fences when trying to reach the sea (yes, they where extremly close to the beach) because the smoke limited visibility and mobility
Even thought the whole country saw the consequences of  arbitrarily building inside a forrest arrea, reconstruction plans are being made
My country is already religious but yeah this happens even with the irreligious ones
saying some common expression of ones language doesn't make him/her religious, there are many words and expressions that have roots in the various religions of the world that doesn't mean they are used religiously, it's empty words like thoughts and prayers etc
My first hand experience: My family is orthodox but not particularly observant or faithful
That said, whenever someone died we (and when I say 'we' I mean my mother, the rest of us just followed) suddenly turned into Eleni Louka: we went to church more than twice a week, prayed and fasted, before finally going back to our normal, religiously indifferent lives a couple months later
In my experience, atheists who hold the the last position you outline
>In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities
... are very rare
The terms themselves (absence or rejection of belief in a deity vs ignorance on the existence of deities) fundamentally have no contradiction between themselves, you can absolutely hold both
Unless you talk to hardline theists/atheists, I would guess the majority of people can be led down a line of argument that ends at their acknowledgement that they do not or cannot know if (a) god exists
This acknowledgement is in no way incompatible with faith or lack/rejection thereof
Was going to say exactly this
"Agnostic atheism" is in fact the default position most atheists have, as in, they do not believe or want to (are irreligious) but also abstain from making claims on whether god exists; this is something only "militant atheists" sometimes do, but it's rarely dressed in absolute sounding language
*Nobody* is 100% certain
Therefore agnosticism is a "default" position of sorts
It is in no way incompatible with being atheist, however, the contrary in fact
I categorically disagree
You're essentially equating disbelief/lack of belief to believing, as in, you're saying there's a leap of faith involved for atheists to reject belief in a god, which in my opinion is a misunderstanding of the term
I have, ever since I acquired the vocabulary for this subject, defined myself as [agnostic atheist] The fact of the matter is that not even the most ardent believers *know* if there's "something out there", they simply have faith one way or another
In awareness of my ignorance, I simply refused to involve myself with organized religion so long as social life allows and have almost no spiritual baggage as a result
"Malaka" as is tradition
Older people probably say that they have been there on holidays and they had a great time
"I've always wanted to go to Greece for vacation"
I don't really mind but sometimes they go
"Pay debts" Like damn bro it's 2020 it's been a while since the crisis and every country is in debt
When I tell them I'm from Greece their reaction is mostly "oh really
", sometimes followed by "you don't look like greek".
Used to be interested, now they will probably look at you like a monster
I'd say people from the Balkans would get along as we share so many common cultural things
But most of the times there is a national conflict between most countries which i guess makes people less comfortable
As to greece and serbia, it probably has to do with the fact that we share the same religion (orthodox christianity)
Μηπως μας κανανε και στους 2 λαους πειραματα με lsd τη δεκαετια του 50;
Χαχαχαχα, i see you are a man of culture
They were more popular in the past but they never had a huge impact here except maybe in the late 00s-early 10s where machines who make ozonated water, window nets & heaters were pretty popular
One of my relatives had the machine who makes ozonated water, i remember the taste wasn't much different from the tap water
OMG i also remember this commercial
It was broadcasted in the Greek TV too
Chef Tony is such a legend
Probably [this] photo of the Nazi flag being erected on the Acropolis during the German occupation of Greece
A few days later, the flag was torn down by two resistance fighters, Apostolos Santas and Manolis Glezos
Despite being the most inspiring act of resistance during the occupation, the two men were persecuted after the liberation by the anti-communist post-war government (which was largely made up of Nazi collaborators - thanks UK and US) and were sent into exile
Santas died in 2011, but Glezos is still alive and even served as an MP and MEP a few times
low effort post
an(y)  aerial photography  of the  Acropolis/ Parthenon
I spent way too much time reading about the Munich Massacre, inspired by your post
Thanks
In my opinion Italian is absolutely beautiful
I also like Spanish but Italian is just more
song-like
Not sure if that made any sense but you (hopefully) get my point
I'm one of the few people in Greece that like the sound of German i think
Hahah
The opposite is true as well
I find it really easy and enjoyable to mimic the Spanish accent
in our modern history after we freed ourselves, all of our monarchs were foreign, because it was outrageous back then to be a democracy so we had a german noble installed and that continued until our last one
All of the modern Greek royalty have been of Bavarian or Danish heritage
If the "Great Powers" of the time had been more agreeable, they would probably have been Belgian, because after governor Kapodistrias was assassinated, the first choice was Leopold of Belgium but his demands weren't met
In recent times we had George Papandreou (born in Minessotta, US)
Bavarian (Otto etc) and Danish (George, Constantine etc)
yeah otto was thrown out but i didn't remember if the next ones were danish, german or austrian
yeah so they could control us have us as puppet states, not because they were sad about our nations
Oh, I thought OP meant like "foreigner-foreigner".
Anyway, that explains the constant spoonerisms
Although, considering he was in the same party with Simitis, I wonder who was the master and who was the disciple
lol
Oh, my bad
He was born abroad, his mother was American, and he lived completely abroad until he was 22 years old
OK he is greek in the sense greek-americans are greek, but he is not like 'technically foreign born'. He grew up abroad until he was an adult
English teacher thought "together" is pronounced and written "torgether".
We had a cool young teacher in a vocational high school, he was I think a nurse or something in the medical field anyway, and he asked us to write anonymously anything we liked
A few days later one of the few answers he read aloud was mine
I had wrote something funny about my classmates being lobotomized etc
A kid then stops him and asks "What's a lobotomy
" and he answers "I have no idea at all, I don't think it's a real word
I don't understand what this whole thing means"...
I never took seriously anything he ever said or taught after that
Did a Bulgarian write your history book
The modern greek word Historia( ιστορία) has root from the ancient greek word histor(ιστωρ) which means the one who knows a lot on a certain  subject, who is an expert
Ok, I'll do my part for Greece even tho I am not the best person for it as I am not religious
Holiday description according to Wikipedia:
The 6th of January in Greece is called Θεοφάνεια (= divine revelation)
Also goes by names like Επιφάνια (= epiphany) or Γιορτή των Φώτων (= holiday of the Lights)
It celebrates the day Jesus was baptised and basically the revelation of the holy Trinity
So, us Greeks, honor this day by throwing a cross in the sea/lake/river and believers race to retrieve it
In our version of orthodoxy, it's called theophania, and it symbolizes the baptism of Christ
There's carols specific to the day, there's a ceremony where the priest blesses the waters during which he throws a cross inside the sea, lake or wherever the ceremony takes place, and swimmers rush to find it, with the person finding it having good luck or something like that
At some point they also release pigeons symbolizing the holy spirit
Customarily, many take a bottle of holy water with them that day (the priest blesses a container of drinkable water for the faithful to take home)
"Σα βγεις στον πηγαιμό για την Ιθάκη,
Να 'υχεσαι να 'ναι μακρύς ο δρόμος" probably,
by Kavafis, from the poem Ithaca
Roughly translated to
"When you get on your way to Ithaca (Odysseus's homeland),
wish for the road to be long"
I would say yes, we tend to be portrayed in a friendly, hospitable and proud way
Every film about the life of Jesus is (at least supposedly) set there
Also many films about the Old Testament and other ancient events and empires
You understand that there are many stereotypes in such films
Don't do [this]
If you wanna wave at someone, just keep your fingers close
Definitely not a luxury brand . Nowadays an affordable to a little pricey, depending on some items, brand
The food market is great though , the restaurant also good .
Unreliable Nordic furnitures that requires you to build them yourself
With long ass names that are unpronounceable too
IKEA in Greece, is considered expensive, stylish and  not very sturdy as furnitures
Greeks tend to buy pieces of furniture  here and there but I don't know anyone that has furnished his whole house from IKEA
I'm not sure how it's viewed in the whole country but I live 5minutes away from the one in the Athens airport so we've always been getting our furniture from there and always are aware of any sales going on in it
Known as that place that serves horse meatballs without your knowledge
( dont know if it's real or just an urban myth)
It's definitely not seen as a luxury furniture store, quite the opposite I might say
We kinda see it as a student  furniture store, although I find it ridiculously expensive compared to quality and the fact that you have to assemble everything on your own
Their food is extremely cheap though, and also very tasty
The furnitures wouldn't last more than 2 weeks
Greek feta has entered the chat
Myzithra
Ladotyri
Manouri
Kalathaki
Formaela
Metsovone
Katiki
Sfela
Just the ones out the top of my head that are amazing and pretty much nobody outside greece knows
Most USian 'Italian' restaurants are actually Greek
Myzithra dry is good for pasta, and the 'fresh' version is really tasty as a salad cheese
Yeah definitely I think cheese and cured meats is where every European country has something amazing to offer
I can't think of a country that won't have some good cheese and salami like thing to go with their bread
The worse the local cuisine, the more international restaurants you get
Britain > Netherlands > Germany > Austria > Italy etc
I lived in the Netherlands for 2 years
I liked kaasuffle and frikandels
But I'm hard pressed to name any other good dutch food
Like a sausage and some root veggies
Maybe you like British food because they're in the same family
It isn't though, is it
I think that especially Greece is suffering from over-tourism that has created many restaurants that serve sub-par food (and only tourists go there)
For example, I love Moussaka but NEVER order it at restaurants (unless I know the restaurant in my neighborhood is good) because there are 2 things that go wrong: 1) the mince meat in moussaka is so 'hidden' under layers of other things that they can use all the leftover meat from other things (bolognese sauce for pasta, leftover cooked beef etc) and 2) eggplants take A LOT of oil to cook, and it is not affordable to use good olive oil in restaurants
So you get an eggplant that has been fried on cheap shitty oil
Moussaka is an amazing dish if made at home or at select places, but the fact that it is the staple of tourist traps is mind boggling for me
If you go to Greece I suggest trying the various 'mezes' that are like tapas plates and have really interesting flavors
Also coal grilled meat and fish of course
Don't judge Greek cuisine by what you may have experienced in the Netherlands, the restaurants abroad are really a different thing (outdated and touristy) than what you will experience in Athens for example
Lol ok
I see all the people flocking to the UK for the food
And all the English restaurants around the world
People come to the UK for many reasons, I have never heard a single person saying "I'll fly to manchester from France/Italy/Greece to get some good food". I've heard the opposite plenty
There's more Greek restaurants in the UK than British restaurants (what
) in the whole world
Sure you can pay big money to get some michelin stars or whatever, but the local cuisine, what people cook is deep fried crap and microwaved TV dinners
You have the famous chefs that put peas in carbonara like gordon ramsay
Give me a break lol
There are more Greek Restaurants in the UK alone, than British Restaurants in the rest of the world
Because even though you conquered half the world nobody wants to eat your food
The restaurants around the world that offer British dishes mostly do so to appeal to British tourists that can't venture to eat anything that is not deep fried
The Ottoman Empire
North Macedonia
Germany's, From Barbarians to conqueror's, to the Holy Roman empire, the thirty years war, Prussia, and then the unification of Germany, the World wars, the Berlin wall, I'm just fascinated With Germany and all of history in General
I also love Austria's history
The history of Italy really fascinates me, and they way it blends in with the history of Greece
I also find the history of Denmark quite interesting
Well Sweden mainly wrecked the imperial Army in the thirty years war
(Greece) Oh man so many times to pick from
I will take the question as 'my country' including the region historically (since modern Greece is only like 200 years old)
I think I would travel to Athens during the Hellenistic era (after Alexander the Great and before the Romans) and I would spend one week touring all the different philosophical schools
Epicureans, Stoics, Pythagoreans, Neoplatonists etc
I would take in all the amazing technology they had invented and the pinnacle of ancient civilization before the roman conquest and christian dark ages
It would be awesome
In general, I'd love to visit either Ancient Greece, or Thessaloniki during the Byzantine Empire
But I'd probably end up picking the winter of '41, just so my bitchass remembers that next time I'm about to complain about a small dumb thing
i can't think of a good time where i wouldn't die
i guess i'd like to meet my grandpa young but i can either meet him before he becomes 17 or late 20s without getting in ww2
I know the Cypriot national anthem because it's the same as the Greek one
I can understand on the spot the French and Russian anthem and with a bit of try the Polish one
Very little
I know only my country's anthem and few others
Generally I'm not fan of national anthems to the point that when i watch a video who features a national anthem i skip that part
I'm pretty sure is "Λαμψη" (Shine)
it was a soap opera running for over a decade
so a couple of thousand episodes I guess
After reading other comments our longest running TV show seems tiny
It's called Lampsi (=the Shine) and it aired for about 15 years (~3
500 episodes total)
My aunt used to watch it and I recall watching a few episodes with her and wanting to cry of boredom
Every second dialogue of the show went like this: -I have a lover
-Virna, are you trying to say that you have a lover
-Yes, Yiago, I wanted to tell you that I have a lover
-So, you mean that you have a lover
-Yiago, I can hide it no longer, I have a lover
-How dare you have a lover, Virna
and so on
You get the idea
Damn, you might wanna take a look at [this
According to this list, "Η Λάμψη" (The Shine) has been the longest running Greek TV series
It was aired everyday in Greece for more than 14 years (1991-2005) and has had 3'457 episodes
It was also dubbed into Bulgarian and aired in Bulgaria between 2000 and 2010
Not really "in my country", but Cypriots have really hard accents to understand when  they talk to other Cypriots (they change them when talking to us though, nice lads)
Cyprus speaks Greek, or at least that's what they claim
I have no idea what they say most of the time though
&#x200B;
EDIT: I'm not being mean by the way, I hope it doesn't come out that way
Islandic Greek evolved independently on each island
Cypriot Greek has a big influence from Ancient Greek and English
When I lived in London I met many people who were SHOCKED it snows in Greece
They assumed it's all beach and hot weather without realizing the country is mostly mountainous
I live near Athens, so we get either sleet, rain or snow that doesn't get blanketed (if that is the term)
Every few years, we get the real stuff, and it usually is newsworthy because everything slows down due to the chains required and the fear of ice, even with salt and wood chips on the tarmac
I wasn't expecting to get so worried by this thread
It depends on what part of the country you're talking about
In the south, like Crete, it basically just doesn't snow, ever
In Athens it snows once every few years
In the North, like Thessaloniki, you better prepare for a long and cold winter every year
I don't think I remember even a single year where it hasn't snowed in the North
Athens
Super Rarely
In Thessaloniki and nearby regions it is almost guaranteed to snow
Here in Northern Greece it snows maybe 3 or 4 times a year (like 2cm of snow that melts in a day)
However, I know for a fact that in many regions here, especially mountainous, it snows a lot
Climate change probably
My ex was from Fyn and I've noticed that Fyn's climate is strangely similar to that of my hometown in northern Greece
Nose rings are mostly seen as ok even in some professional settings
The rest of them could be considered rather informal in the workplace, and you would be discouraged from wearing them
In a casual setting though it's no big deal, except for the occasional grandma who will suddenly be reminded of her cow that had several rings and bells and chains to not get lost
They're ignored for the most part
The people that are 50 and down, and most educated people aged 70-90, will not view someone that is atheist as something bad nor they will criticize him
On the other hand some extremely religious people 30% of the population will tell you that god exists and other stuff
They maybe even fight
Although the majority of the population follows the Orthodox church, I think younger people (younger than 30-35 ) are mostly atheist/agnostics
Thus, I don't think being an Atheist causes any problems to most of them
Our previous PM ( A.Tsipras ) was an atheist, and that didn't seem to really influence the public vote in 2015
His [facial expressions]
I think the pictures speak on their own
That he looks like Mr Bean(Spoiler he does)
His name is correlated with bad luck so none says his name
And that he is the Greek Mr Bean
We elected him and now he runs it
And that he is unlucky,(i.e. when he was elected prime minister in July: Some time later (a week or so) there was the biggest or 2nd biggest earthquake in Greek history)
Mainly, his [terrible command of the English language
We ate the donkey, we are left with the queue
In Greek there's no "sh" sound, we say Βουδαπέστη (Voudapésti) with an "s" sound and the "d" pronounced as a "th" like in the word "the"
we call it Βουδαπέστη (Voudapesti) with a normal S sound
Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic
All three extremely different, from different parts of the world, that are spoken widely and open the most doors, or maybe Albanian cause my friend is from there idk
Danish, because I'm in love with it and the pronunciation is unforgiving
Spanish, because I'm in love with it and the grammar is unforgiving
And for a third option I'll choose German
Italian, French and Swedish
I already know some Italian, but I am by no means fluent in it
I would also really like to learn Spanish but the other 3 I listed are my top priorities in terms of how much I want to learn them
I probably am going to learn them all someday though, when I find the time
Ancient Greek, Latin and French
Because history is fun and also with those 3 I can learn any other language easily
Welsh is my flex third choice too, after English and Greek haha
When you say Indian so you mean Hindi
Cause there's thousands of languages in India
They are grammatically and syntactically compatible, being fluent at one will give you a limited understanding of the other but they are definatly not the same
I do, I mean Welsh is my actual flex language, I do speak out
If I could choose the three to learn itd be Spanish Arabic Mandarin
All police officers carry a handgun but the general rule is that they won't fire back unless they are fired upon with another firearm
Seeing heavily armed police officers is extremely rare, as in something really bad must have happened for them to get out
(I do not count Riot police in this because they again are not armed with firearms)
In Greece, most National police officers are armed
However municipal police is unarmed
And tbh, I don't find the usefulness of an unarmed police
What will they do
Call the cops
Greek police is always armed,with hand guns
But we have  different task forces, that are gradually more armed than the other
It's not common to see the more heavily armed walking on the streets
It has to be something really serious to be called
Europe, Asia, Africa, N and S America, Oceania, Antarctica
Yep
Same in Greece
We were taught about one America at my school, I thought that was the standard in Greece
Well I might be rembering it wrongly
In Athens they tried to build a infrastructure to cycle the whole city
People hated the idea and thought it was stupid because of the traffic
2 million euros were lost and the project got canceled about a month ago
In Thessaloniki (second biggest city and my hometown) it is more or less the same
Almost nothing
This year (I guess because of covid) they built a couple of lanes but no one use them since it's impossible to magically appear there with a bike out of nowhere
Roads are too dangerous to even get there
It's just a couple of lanes
I hope it will get improved but I doubt
Greek people love their cars and sadly most of us, think that bikes are for kids
We got what we deserve I guess
So, I've always had this question about countries where cycling to work is the norm
After 8km, I would assume you are somewhat sweaty and you wouldn't be wearing your work clothes while cycling either way
Do your offices/schools and such have showers and changing rooms where you change
Or what
Usually we grill and prepare a shit ton of food or more rarely order a shit ton of food, people arrive in advance before the food is ready to chat for a couple of hours
There will by music and loud conversations
We eat and then we have coffee and desert in which there will also be loud and long  conversations about a wide variety of topics
The reasons for the family gathering can be birthdays, a new baby, name days, or any happy new thing that happened
We average 12-18 people in big gatherings and we prepare food for 24 but generally I grew up having l my aunts family living in the same block of flat so 9/10 times we would eat together in the weekends
I am currently studying in another city alone and I do miss the noise of 2 families gathering to eat each weekend
(and ofcourse the food)
It starts like a regular thanksgiving type table and then after the parents have drunk some Raki they blast songs, break plates and dance all together on the broken plates
Even though this is the proper way theoretically, I've never seen such consistency before
I think nobody would actually use it that way, oder
A plausible answer
I'll skip the ancients, and instead mention some modern historical figures:
\- The "Heroes of 1821", AKA of the Greek War of Independence (Theodoros Kolokotronis, Georgios Karaiskakis, Manto Mavrogenous, Laskarina Bouboulina, Athanasios Diakos, Nikitaras, Alexandros Ypsilantis, the list goes on and on
Special mention to three of the founders of the Filiki Etaireia, whose names we -or at least I- memorized thanks to a short quote, "A blonde jackal wearing a cap", Xanthos, Tsakalov, Skoufas)
\- Ioannis Kapodistrias (first head of a newly independent Greece)
\- Eleftherios Venizelos (arguably the most important politician of Modern Greece, early 20th century)
\- Ioannis Metaxas (dictator 1936-1941
Among the reasons he's so widely known is the fact that he refused to allow the passage of the Italian army through Greece in 1940, an occasion that is celebrated as a national holiday -28th of October, the "Ochi/No Day")
\- Aris Velouchiotis (leading figure of the Greek resistance during the occupation of Greece in WW2)
\- Georgios Papadopoulos (leader of the Junta Regime, 1967-1974)
\- Andreas Papandreou (another important politician, mid- to late 20th century)
From the Byzantines I'd say Constantine the Great, the pair Justinian-Theodora, Basil II and Constantine XI are the most famous
As far as culture is concerned, there are certain people that almost everyone could name, whether they've come in contact with their work or not (El Greco, Solomos, Cavafy, Elytis, Seferis, Merkouri)
&#x200B;
*Edit: Grammar and wrong name*
Alexander the Great
Leonidas
Sokrates
Pericles
Aristotle
Pythagoras
Archemides
Theodoros Kolokotronis
Georgios Karaiskakis
Eleftherios Venizelos
I think you all know the Ancient Ones, the last 3 are very important figures in modern Greek, aka post Ottoman Greek history
Oh yeah, totally missed him
Allies in the First Balkan War then switching to enemies in the Second
Just Balkan stuff
Jokes aside, Greece and Bulgaria are the best regional example on how two nations that were bickering with each other for a very long time can put an end to this shit
There is no animosity post WW2 and no hot topics between Bulgaria and Greece anymore
In Greece I haven't heard of balcony related deaths or injuries
The last few years I also hear about these news elsewhere in the south yet I have no idea why
I hope it doesn't become a trend cause we have balconies too
They do all the other stuff you know too
Really drunk, sex acts and stuff
They're usually young so it's so stupid from their part to do this
Yes
Nope, fortunately they don't do that here
Although we have Many balconies
They are usually drunk and they tend to be in a lot of fights
And I mean a Lot
Usually with other Brits, which is peculiar, at least to me
is that really a thing
this sounds hilarious
I'd say that I don't particularly like the way it sounds and how non-discriptive it can sometimes be, but I like that it's super easy to use and it flows well
I love Greek more in every way tbf, I also know how to speak a bit of Italian and I love it too, also I'm currently learning French, and while I love it, it is making me want to die with some of its phrases (like why are there so many combinations with que, ce and est), but in general, I think the reason that I like Greek, Italian and French more than English is because I have gotten so used to the language (as 90% of the media I watch is in English and I'm exposed to the language for the majority of the day) that I have pretty much gotten bored of it
I'd honestly go as far as to say that I'm exposed to more English than Greek, and I live in Greece lmao (I guess it also depends on if I go out or speak on discord or wherever with friends on a certain day)
Also in "Australia" each a is pronounced differently
Oh great because the second one gives me headaches, I am kinda relieved now
You're lucky to be native french, it's a beautiful language and I wish I didn't have to painstakingly slowly learn it and could **just** know it hahaha
I, for myself, feel safe because I'm in good physical condition, young and there aren't any reported cases in my area
I wouldn't want to go however, because I come in contact, or live with people who are at a higher risk to suffer from the symptoms of covid
hookers, gypsies and mafia
Even northwestern and midwestern Greeks do that, mostly on the mountains
So covid-19 just suits you fine
The Acropolis (the parthenon mostly)
I'm from Thessaloniki, Greece
There are plenty
A walk through the Aristotle's Squere uo until the ancient Roman Agora
From there to the Church of St
Demetrious, the "protector" of the city
along with the catacombs beneath it
The Arch and the Palace of Galerious, and from there to the sea in the White Tower
If you go up you will the Rotunda , that during the Ottoman times it was converted to a mosque and has a beautiful minaret
That's also where the ancient byzantine walls start and go up north
There you will see most if not all of the wall as it was at those times
You can see the Hagia Sophia church , from the 8th century
Recent excavations for the development of the tube brought to light parts of the ancient Via Egnatia, houses and markets
And you have to think that if you dug even deeper you will find Ancient Greek/Macedonian structures
For many Turks that come here they can also see the house where Ataturk was born and raised, serving as the Turkish Consulate in Thessaloniki
We also have dozens of old mosques
And all of these are just in the part of the Centre of the city

I'm glad
Greek is σφυρί (sfyri) from ancient Greek σφῦρα.
The word comes from ασπαίρω (aspero) which means to shake with force or tremple or struggle especially like while dying
In Greek it is σφυρί (sfyrí) which isn't badass to me at least, but yeah
Σφυρί (Sfirí) Nope
Greece doesn't have the most badass word for 'hammer'
>, which sounds like a sexual innuendo
γεια σου βρε αντρα φυσφιρή πού χεις μια πούτσα σαν σφυρί
που'σαι ρε αντρα φυσφιρή που την εχεις σαν σφυρι
oh mean other people's doesn't look like a sfiri ?
I live in Greece
Here most 25 year olds make about 600€ per month
Out of that, an average person might be able to save 50€ if they're lucky
Wow 27
In Greece you're supposed to be finishing university at 22-23(except doctors) . Most people finish at 24 but above that you're considered a failure
Why is it so different in Sweden
I like it
Ye, I would also have to disagree
Europe once had the resources to provide such a structure (super-inflated pensions, social welfare, free healthcare etc) both through strategic advantages vs the rest of the world and because young folks contributed to social security funds
Nowadays Europe lacks in both
We may still have financial services, some cars, tourism, education, but we are steadily falling behind
The majority of our top-notch tech is being made in Asia or in the US, and our energy comes from Russia or the middle East
Young people, also, are making less money compared to their parents (in same price levels), yet have to contribute to greatly higher pensions than their parents had to
The system is almost some kind of an elaborate pyramid scheme, where younger populations support the benefits of the retired ones
And as such, it needs a constant influx of young workers just like a pyramid constantly needs new sellers
Which contradicts the overpopulation issue of the planet
Under these circumstances, Europe should by no means be providing free welfare any more, especially to potential workers that have so far made zero contribution to our funds
What should happen is a rationalization of Europe's welfare system
Since this would happen in favor of the younger populations and against the older ones, no soon-to-be retired political figure would dare to deal with it
We start uni right after high school, nobody does a gap year here
Basically it's a mentality of: high school -> university-> find a job
I wasn't talking about graduating from a master's, sorry for the confusion
Of course if people do a master's then they graduate later
We choose the field we want to study at 18, we give general exams(not specific ones in each university)based on that field, so we have a variety of departments to choose from
We make a list and then it depends on our scores and on other students scores, so in reality you can end up in a department that wasn't your first or second choice
However, even if people don't like what they're studying they don't drop out cause you **have to finish it**. It's sad to be honest but I can understand the pressure, it's the way/mentality that has always been
It is a lot of pressure and this is why we finish our bachelor in 5 or 6 years instead of 4 which is the official duration
Haha I wish the children thing was true here, people actually don't have money to raise kids so in the past years after the economical crisis the birth rate is lower than the death rate
Cretans are the first to freeze to death in 10°C and we are the first to die of a heat stroke in 25°C
Greeks and Italians had had this debate for centuries, Italians like their pasta al dente, and us greeks like them mushy
I’ve tried both and personally prefer them mushy, but that might be because it reminds me of my mothers cooking
I definitely like it al dente
what kind of barbarian does this
on topic i like them al dente too, if they are too cooked it's like eating vomit with hair
We don't throw toiler paper in the toilet, instead we have a basket next to it with a plastic bag attached inside it and we throw it there
When it gets full, we empty the basket by removing the bag and then we install a new one
That we all act way too rich for pretty much a third world country, I guess
Correct
The pipe that comes from the toilet in individual buildings is smaller than normal, not the sewer system
It isn't really a problem though, there is an extendable showerhead right beside the toilet in every bathroom
Wash your butt in the toilet, mushing poop on your skin isn't sanitary
I find them a bit silly for how "easy" it is in English and how big of a deal they make out of it at least from what little I know about these things
In Greek there are a more than 9 letters that sound the exact same but you have a gazillion spelling and grammar rules that dictate when you use what
Then you have special occasions, ancient Greek roots etc
I can see a school having a local competition but nothing more that that
However they are often questions in TV games
Like for example
Pick the correct spelling of the word message
Μινυμα
Μεινιμα
Μοινοιμα
Μινιμα
Μινημα
Μυνιμα
Μυνημα
Μήνυμα
These are just a few of the possible of combinations and you would read them all the same, the question usually have a combination of υ η and I since the correct spelling is the last one (if you notice autocorrect picked that one and filled the acute on η)
Many native speakers often confuse the last two choices
Then as a bonus you also have spellings that are both accepted, for example
Beer => μπύρα or μπίρα
Egg => αυγό or αβγό
Then again in the spelling bees I remember that they often use hard words which sound easy for me because their ancestry is Greek, like for example any medical term
Were I would struggle is to spell it out quickly but then again I am not a native speaker, if you allowed me to right it down first I think I would be fine
Take this word for example,
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconios
Half if Greek half is Latin, still a bitch of a word but if I could right it down as I hear it I think I could manage, but if I had to spell it out in 8 seconds after hearing it, yeah no good luck with that
But I don't feel like you can call that a word, it's a bunch of words (the literal meaning of the word) fused together
You can do a shit tone of fuckery with this, there is a single word that is like 5 sentences in an ancient Greek play and it's basically a recipe with all the ingredients fused together into on word
Or a usual suspect when thinking of big word back when i was a kid
Σκουληκομυρμηγκότρυπα
Which is the fuse of worm-ant-hole and guess what it means
There are also some math/science competitions, if I remember correctly but that's about it
I agree it seems to be a cultural difference
Definitely not by counting votes from each state for over a day
We elect 300 members of parliament (βουλευτές), the party that has over 150 seats is tasked with forming a government and traditionally the party leader becomes the prime minister
In case the leading party has less seats, the president tasks them to explore the possibility of making a multi-party/coalition(?) government, otherwise we vote again
Our president is elected by the members of parliament and has no executive powers
They just replace the old puppet with a new puppet and they keep doing the same shit
Quite the opposite I would say
Parents here and the society in general pressure you to not proceed with making a family before you mature enough, figure out what you're gonna do in life and/or find a stable income
It is generally expected that you start thinking about marriage only after the ages of 28-30
With women though, that is not completely the rule as they start facing pressure from their inner circle as their friends begin to get married and have children
I don't know if that is self-imposed or actual externally imposed pressure
There is some pressure, as soon as i got out of the university got to feel it . My mother was always questing when i ll got married and she would see grandchildren ... I didn't even had a gf at that point and that kept happening for years, a decade at least ... She was driving me crazy
Now that i am 34 she has calmed down i think
My Mom tells me every day
Every time my aunts see me they say the same thing
My Dad and Uncles might say it once every 6 months
Trust me I doubt it's self umposed
We may want to have children but more in a sense of someday
But the pressure usually comes from family members and colleagues . I.e. a couple of days ago a colleague of mine told me i m borderline in the middle of being late as when she was 31 she had both her sons
Like I'm going to ολως τυχαιως μυρίσω τον κρίνο και θα μείνω έγκυος since I'm single
So while I would say society nowadays has stop the pressure it also depends on the family and environment .
* Attica: Big city problems, rude, touristic, yells at drivers, fast paced, thinks they are better than Thessaloniki, needs stuff to happen **NOW
* Thessaloniki: Same as above -except calmer- dislikes Atticians
* Aegean Islands: Sea-fearer, engaged in the tourism business, *toooo* calm
* Ionian Islands: Cultured, sophisticated, enlightened, progressive, snobbish, thinks that are better than everyone due to proximity to Italy
* Thrace: Diverse, *tooooo* weird, multi-cultural, peculiar cuisine
* Thessaly: Farmers
* Mani: Superstitious, alcoholic, engaged in blood feuds, territorial, independent, mountain folk, strong, family values, backwards-looking, conservative, violent, thinks that are better than everyone else due to Spartan origins
* Crete: Same as Mani, replace Sparta with the Minoans
* Agrafa: Same as above, replace the Minoans with the Dorians (see a pattern
Thessaloniki: Outgoing, fun and "chill". Slightly noticeable accent
Women overdo it with self-care
Other northern regions (Serres, Kastoria, Florina, Kilkis): Cold (metaphorically and literally), quiet, distant
Patras: Sluts
Crete: Greece's far west
Guns, weed and alcohol
Melodic accent
Overly hospitable
Larissa: Very noticeable accent, commonly joked about
Popular aegean islands: Their residents are probably nonexistent
Chalkidiki: No place like it, according to the Thessalonikians
Preveza: They like sardine
A lot
Thrace: Lots of muslims
Epirus and Ionian islands: Friendly, kind and cool
The probem with Crete is that they have around half a million population
And they fit your description (Mani is tiny, noone cares)
Thessaloniki and rural Macedonia have issues with localism,feeling "neglected" and blaming everything on Athens
And they have a ridiculous accent
Olive oil pump
[This object] is used to pump olive oil out of large containers, which every household in Greece has
We all know someone in a village from whom we get supplied large containers (5+ liters) with the best fresh olive oil that is sold word to mouth rather than buying supermarket olive oil
Much much better, much cheaper and you know the source
They fortunately are standard equipment in Greece too
Some Older Greek houses also have this three prong plug
It's awesome, we all have our personal oil buckets hahah
That's definitely a close second
Yup haha, even if you open both half the flow will be boiling
Having lived for a while in England, Germany, Spain and Ireland and visited 4 more European countries, I would like for Greece :
Spain's cheap and reliable public transport
I could go anywhere in Zaragoza by tram and the price was lower than the bus prices in Greece
The tram had a fixed time of arrival and you knew you wouldn't be late
Dublin's safe feeling in the city center
In Athens sometimes you feel you have walked into Karachi or Mogadishu at night if you walk alone in some areas
The big green spaces in the city that are found in England
Greek cities lack green
24/7 supermarkets (from England again)
Youth hotspots in the city being super gay friendly (cheers again Spain
For our big cities to actually feel like they fit in Europe, they are all ugly, dirty and have shit infrastructure, you can't look at capital cities in Europe, and then take a look at Athens and be like "ah yes, this is an EU capital". All of Greece's big cities are ugly actually, only the islands are nice, but it makes up for it when you can go to an island in summer by boat
Living in Dublin, all these issues are secondary
The first and foremost issue that it seems that Irish politicians don't give a shit about is the absurd price of rents
I should not have to pay 800+ per month for a small room in a shared flat in Dublin
Really
Why tho
Here every small cafe and kiosk has pos
Ive even seen pos at certain open air producers markets
many taxis also got one
You still might get weird looks if you try to pay 30 cents with card, but one coffee is totally acceptable
Oh yeah
In Stuttgart I was always getting the impression that almost all the employees above the age of mid20s were unwilling to help even a tiny bit further than they were strictly obliged too
They preferred blank stares
The worst thing is that NO political party seems to acknowledge it as a problem or willing to do anything about it
They only talk about social housing, building new houses etc etc
Nothing about lowering the rents to more affordable prices
The Sinn Fein is mostly caring about the rents that people that can barely make enough for living pay (which is good of course, but that is not the only problem with rents, because I can pay  it doesn't mean that I *should* pay that much), and are also almost completely ignoring the rents for students and other people around my age
Having lived in many different places, this is the one that I found Southern Europe is much more "humane" than the rest : cheap rents
In Spain I had a huge room in a shared flat in the center of Zaragoza for
250 euros
Oh yeah right lel
I think that was a huge thing here as well
But now its super easy to pay with card and avoid it
Of course, that leaves you with little room for haggling
But some still offer the no-receipt price lel
That is not true
Stuttgart was exactly like this
Except for supermarkets, I was struggling to find anything accepting credit/debit cards
Germany has a cash obsession
It is a very slow procedure, that would
a) take years to show any results,
b) drop the rent prices in the suburbs of Dublin - and then you would need to commute, so the overall expense would be the same,
c) is a bit of a moot point cause Dublin's population is growing faster than the housing market, because of the job opportunities
The goal should be to make accommodation affordable, not just offer more accommodation in the same more or less price
Cap them
Give tax benefits to landlords who rent the appartments at cheaper prices
Hairdressers/Barbers - everything that didn't have extremely high prices was accepting only cash
Every small shop owner by Turkish-origin Germans
Bars/cafes that had very often a "broken" card reader
if you think about it every city in Greece is an old Greek city
my town was one of the 12 cities Thesseus united into Athens so we have the part with the ancient ruins, everything else is at best 1970s because the population of this town blew up in the 90s before that it was just some beach village
I'm pretty sure most parties use this as their motto at this point
There was a time when we had two leading parties (still do, just different ones)
The two heads were classmates and roommates in uni
The sirtaki from Zorbas and Zeibekiko tis Evdokias maybe
(Greece)
I would say the most famous song in terms how other countries know us is the sirtaki dance from the movie Zorba the Greek, which was composed by Mikis Theodorakis [
Omg there is also a greek version of this lovely song
"Apo kseno topo ki apo alargino"
And **Tis Dikaiosinis**, I would add
tbh, a couple of personal favourites are I agapi mou stin Ikaria and Pedia tis Samarinas, though many act kinda haughty when listening to the latter or other demotika, no idea why
We have a city called Kastoria (beaver) and a town called Astakos (lobster) even though neither of those animals live anywhere near there
not a location but we call pork tenderloin "psaronefri" (ψαρονέφρι) which literally means fish kidney and no one understands why
Who makes that claim
I can only think of the extra right
But isn't the whole point about getting rid of countries
First of all, that's quite a leap
Extremists
It's quite the opposite in my opinion
Also, the main opponents of unification are usually citizens of the "big countries", that think they will have to go backward and get the short end of the stick in order to help the smaller countries, something that -admittedly- already happens to an extent, within the eurozone especially
Of the federalization, not everyone's.
Well, states still exist in federalist unions, like the US for example
Nations are arbitrary constructs anyway, and they will exist of course after a potential unification
Countries won't.
But, thinking ahead, in 2-3 generations after the unification of Europe, the national identities will be brushed aside, not eliminated, and the European identity will be prevalent
So there will be no "big country" or "small country" citizen
Of course, some "provinces" will be richer than others, as is the case in any country, but ultimately the common identity is what pro/pan-Europeans are promoting
Even geopolitically, as that seems to be a concern of yours, a federalization will be truly beneficial for Europe, which is mainly competing with Russia, China, and the US on the global stage
Unfortunately, the EU, at its current form, is too slow and fragmented to pose as a serious antagonist to these superpowers
Sleeping well, not so much
I would argue there is time for proper meals, save for people in corporate jobs and maybe large supermarkets
Small businesses, pharmacies, doctor's offices, lawyers, and the public sector are closed during lunchtime, for at least 3-4 hours, which a lot of people take advantage of to eat lunch (lunch is our main meal in Greece) and maybe nap
Depending on your job you may or may not have enough time to sleep properly, but in general Greeks will go to sleep around 12am - 2am and have various waking times
For the past decade and a half, the members of one parish in Athens celebrate Easter by [throwing Molotov cocktails in the road outside the church when the priest says "Christ has risen
".]
If Athens is a the shithole of of europe wait until you see the rest of Greek "villages". The exception of course is the nature, monuments and a few islands
You know how people will often say: "french people have it easy learning Spanish because the two languages have similarities, it's not fair to us (Scandinavians, Slavic people, etc)" and the same deal with other combinations
Fear no more, nobody speaks languages similar to ours, so it's going to be an equal pain to everyone to learn
Except for Greeks and Cypriots, but there's only like 11-12 millions of us so who cares
Greek was actually lingua franca in the eastern mediteranean region for many centuries
Pro: There are a lot of sources in the region that are written originally in greek, (Plato, Socrates even the New Testament)
Many english words specially scientific ones have their root on a greek word, and knowing greek they can be understood better
Against: Greece has a different alphabet, not the latin one
Many of the ancient sources are not written in modern greek but in ancient greek or koine greek, which is hard to be read even from greeks
There aren't any close languages to greek you can understand, only words
For the same reasons, italian could be the next lingua france since there are a lot of sources in latin and spanish/french will be easy to learn
I guess knowing german would also beneficial due to many similar languages, but I don't know that for sure
Many alphabets are based on Greek
Also it was already the lingua franca before so why not again
Againist this would be the fact that η, υ, ι, ει, οι all sound like "ee" and that ε, αι both sound like "eh". Kinda weird of you ask me
Edit: It would also be neat being able to understand what many weird words used in other languages really mean
(mathematics, physics, geography, Gaia, photography, logotype, mega, hyperbole, psycho, center, diarrhea
It's the language from thr birthplace of western civilization, you already use many words from this language and it is a very structured a logical language, pronunciation of words has easy and clear to follow rules
Cons: You think spelling is hard until you meet Greek, then it's gets worse, much much more worse
ω ο
η ι υ ει οι
γγ γκ
Just from the top of my head
When there's Rome ,Eastern Romans *always* tag along
We'd still have an advantage, modern Greek is an oversimplified version of classical Greek, plus we have compulsory ancient Greek subjects throughout middle and high school
Plus, we'd get to make fun of the Erasmian accent, since the modern accent is actually closer to classical accent than his try according to scholars
Look up Zolotas speech on YouTube
He's an ex PM of ours that at some point delivered a speech in English using entirely Greek loanwords
He was Dutch, he wasn't acclimated to the Greek alphabet or the language's intricacies
While his efforts were valiant and advanced the understanding of how our ancestors spoke back then, Greek scholars have reconstructed a pronunciation that is closer to how the ancient tongue was spoken
I know who you mean, but that's in modern times, where one can have videos to get examples, can have a study partner to help with accent etc
Erasmus didn't have that, being used to his mother tongue, some stuff didn't make sense for him, others were hard to use when speaking
He made arbitrary decisions in some cases, and it being an academic project for him rather than a language he aimed to use outside of academic circles, he couldn't practice the language, and since he also tried to reconstruct it, in many cases he was "treading blind"(βάδιζε στα τυφλά)
I think that's apparent in the remarks towards the end of the wikipedia article, where his omissions are listed
Ever heard of the Greco Turkish war
1821, we should never go independent
I want to die: -10°C and below
Cold: -9°C -- -2°C
Chilly: -1 -- 9°C
Perfectly Cool: 10°C -- 19°C
Perfectly Perfect: 20°C -- 23°C
Perfectly Warm: 24°C -- 29°C
Warm: 30°C -- 35°C
Hot : 36°C and above
All of this depends so much on humidity though
A dry and breezy 5°C (or 30°C) can feel great in a sweater and a hat (or t-shirt and shorts)
but rainy, humid 5°C (or 30°C) sucks the life force out of you
When I was last in Ireland it hit humid 25°C and I wanted to die, then came back to Greece and it was dry and 30°C and it felt so much cooler and nicer
unpopular opinion, but I'm really jealous
As someone who had to go through some big chunk of time without proper sun and daylight (due to health reasons) the end results of that really aren't the best for you
It's very different from what you probably are imagining
Sun and vitamin D are really important
I personally consider the entire history of the Byzantine Empire to be a plot hole
Throwing a tantrum for the colour of the flag doesn't seem like a great mindset to me
Rød grød med fløde
Even though I speak danish now (well sort of) this was one of the first things I learned to say in danish
It's a really good way to practice /ʁ/ and /ð̠ˠ/ too
Once used the word smattering amount with an Irish person and he instantly complimented my knowledge of english as a second language

We give ourselves as an example to avoid
In greek its either καλομαθημένος (someone who is used to living easy/well), but also κακομαθημένος (some who is used to living "bad") (bad meaning spoiled)
In Greek we call them "Υπερπροστατευτικους γονείς" =Overprotective parents
I live in Athens, I've never been to the Parthenon, or the acropolis in general
I've only been to museums and some ancient monuments and stuff with school trips, but mostly outside of Athens
Of course, I have seen it many many times from afar when driving, but never actually been there
Yes and no
My town has its own cave, and during the 90s and up until the 2007 crisis, it was an active tourist attraction
I visited it as part of a class trip back in elementary, but ever since, I have only been there once, for a stroll in the parking lot because of the view
Supposedly it has been revived, but with the pandemic and all, it's kind of a no-go
We have a great laography museum too, it's been used for small concerts etc and was donated by a past mayor considered to be the most respected person to have ever held office in my town, but sadly I've never been there, neither to the local winery/wine museum, nor to the theatre/estate an actor built as an homage to ancient and byzantine era traditions
I grew up in Athens, never went on the Parthenon until I was like 16yo and we had some foreign visitors
well i live in Greece so the place is pretty much filled with tourist sites, if it wasn't for school trips i would have never visited the museum of my town, the Akropolis, the ancient Athenian agora and other ancient stuff
I don't think we have a general one used for anything, but we have one specific way of counting that we used when we were the seeker in hide and seek as kids
I remember that every seeker counted in fives with an inflection of voice that kinda made it rhyme
"Πέντε-Δέκα-Δεκαπέντε-Είκοσι-Εικοσιπέντε..."
(Pente-Deka-Dekapente-Ikosi-Ikosipente
"5-10-15-20-25
And we used to count up like this up to 100 and them we left to find the hiders
I don't think we use a specific method
We just count "ena, dyo, tria
" (1,2,3) and so on
Although some Greek guy in the comments said we use the "thousand-one, thousand-two,..." variant
But I'm not really sure we do
Haven't heard it ever
fellow Greeks in this thread say we don't have one, but I remember a family friend teaching me "ένας ελέφαντας / enas elefadas", meaning one elephant, as a way to count
Same in Greece, I don't think there's something like the Germans or Dutch have
Its just ena (pause) dyo (pause) tria etc maybe that's why our deadline estimates are a bit off :P
But the Mississippi thing I had learned as a child with Ross from Friends (not the dj) in the tanning place
I thought it was just Americans that had it but evidently it's other countries too
One thousand - one
One thousand - two
Although in Greek "one thousand" is only 2 syllables
Χίλια - ένα
Χίλια - δύο
^^^/u/my_other_account_471
If you see this thread, there are more countries that do this
Yes we do
We also have University entrance exams and it is very likely that attempting to get into law, medicine, electrical engineering or in the army my lead to irrepearable damage to your psyche
But that's because it is very competitive
For example I got into the top 500 of my country and probably in the top 300 in my field and failed to get into electrical engineering in Athens that accepted 250 students a year
Tangentially, In Greece polytechnics are the way to go if you can finish them
Otherwise the Army if you can be accepted into the Academy
Croatia by far
Somehow they are portrayed as victims of bad Serbs ONLY
They collaborated with the Nazis, destroyed the Yugoslav army from within by defections when Germany invaded, helped them happily kill Serbs and Jews, and had their part in the Bosnian wars as well
Second comes Ukraine, ALSO happy to embrace nazis throughout history to get rid of Russians, until very very recently
I hear you guys, but the top answer should be Croatia
In fact the reason it's not the top answer is because it's so good at doing exactly what the question says
Why should you blame anyone for the Balkan wars
Do you think they were unjustified
Does your country have autonomous regions
In what way are they autonomous
Economically
Culturally
Politically
Yeah, we have an autonomous peninsula which is inhabited and ran by orthodox monks
Honestly, I don't think our government has any substantial power over the region, they just do their own thing, have their own rules (ex
no women or female animals are allowed within a half mile radius from the shore) and I highly doubt they actually pay taxis like us lay people
*does anyone know what happens to female cats and birds
Like how do they keep them out
Do they even make an effort
Well since i see that you are from Greece too you should have told them about our semi-independent part of our country Mt Athos or The holy mountain
It is has its own laws and capital and it is governed by a college of the heads of each monastery (It is sort of a monastic order)
The most strange thing is though that it has a legally recognized abaton meaning that women are forbidden to enter it for any reason
Are the islanders all fluent in Finnish as well
The Basque Country and Navarre get to keep most of their tax income as well I believe
We are humbled that you went through the trouble of writing about this
I could add that it is most commonly called Agio Oros
I'm guessing the Vatican is not included, from what I read it's like a city state but it's treated more like an autonomous region
First time I'm reading this tbh
The ban afaik mentions women only, because Athos is dedicated to Virgin Mary, which is where it gets its nickname, "Garden of Virgin Mary". In one incident, even Katherine the Great of Russia was denied entry by the monks because of that
Ok, that makes sense
Sunday school failed me, that's for sure lol
Well the island I come from, Corfu, would no longer be a part of Greece since it was a part of the French Empire until 1814
I'm not sure about the rest of the Ionian islands though because the British had already conquered some of them
If they're not a part of the French Empire, they are either under British occupation or a part of Greece
Greece also loses the small coastal town of Parga  since it was a part of the Venetian Republic
The British sold the town to the Ottomans when they took over all the islands in our timeline
We dont have those 'language' lessons in my university
As a student in the final year and currently struggling with my dissertation, googling how to do everything like structure, fonts, proper speech and listing sources, uh
thank you for trying
You couldn't get to all of your students anyway, but a positive attitude is really helping out
Also, i find it really great when my professors post material to study or the lectures themselves so we can check them out anytime
Do we really have something better to do during lectures
Propably no, but you know what i mean
Then we can just binge watch the lectures, cause stress is the best motivator
>  As a student in the final year and currently struggling with my dissertation, googling how to do everything like structure, fonts, proper speech and listing sources,
Yeah I remember greek profs telling us to follow "general rules" when writing essays yet never bothered to actually inform us of these rules
WTF
This drove me CRAZY
I asked; what style should i use to list my sources
They said; whatever is fine as long as its correct
I used Harvard style
And then they were like; hmmmmm you know what no, do it in APA
Fuck me
I say they dont need to explain speech and stuff, its trouble but we can figure it out
But they never even *explain* the proper structure of an assignment
Only my mentor prof took the time to do that
And it took me countless google searches in English, translations and searching for papers and essays in greek to figure some stuff out
All it takes for us to understand is a pretty power point from someone who knows this stuff, please
Hahaha i just checked it out thanks for trying anyway:) ill just stick to english tutorials and material, nothing is ever written in greek anyway
Do you not feel like its the biggest waste of your time
I felt that way, and greek is literally my native language
And to comfort us our teachers would say 'dont you complain, theres people taught the same texts in other countries that dont even know greek'. Yeah, f that

Prehistory - 31 BC City States and Kingdoms, subdued by the Romans,
395 -1461 AD Byzantine Empire & Trebizond (Not sure if they Count), Subdued by the Ottomans,
1821 - 1940, 1944 - Today, Modern Hellenic Republic
We oficially lost independence when the Romans came - the battle of Corinth in 146 BC marks the beginning of Roman domination
Afterwards, the various regions passed from one master to another (Romans, Arabs, Ottomans, Venetians, French, Englishmen) until we finally got independence in 1830, roughly 2000 years later
They were basically ethnically Greek Roman citizens
Ρωμιοσύνη, Ρωμιοί, Ρωμιός, Ρωμιά in the Greek language means ethnic Greek that follows the Greek Orthodox Faith
The modern Greek state was created by Ρωμιοί. We still call ourselves that
They are all synonym for greek
It was independent, but not Greek
It was Roman
They called it the (Eastern) Roman Empire, or Romania, but never "Greece". The only reason why it ever existed was the Romans conquering land
It's not like the Roman Empire fell and we gained independence; it went on like before, as Romans
Vienna
I don't really know why
I think it was so over hyped by the people I was traveling with that I was disappointed when I went there
Or maybe it was because I truly loved the city I visited just a day before (Budapest) and in comparison Vienna lost
Istanbul
Due to the way that Turkey has treated it
I wouldn't say i was disappointed, but i was certainly unimpressed
It was Budapest, because it reminded me of Prague
I also didn't like Prague and the older Checzs in general
Me too mate
I live in Thessaloniki
Well, Bolzano would disagree with you
Yeah I thought the same
Maybe during some other time of the year, for instance in Christmas, it would be prettier

What I'm saying is that Milan has always been considered an Italian city, whereas Bolzano has only been considered Italian since 1918 and still feels distinctly un-Italian
it's much easier to have an 'Italian experience' in Milan than Bolzano

Start with Mesopotamian civilizations, ancient Egypt then Persia
Then of course we spend years on ancient Greece, then Rome then Byzantium
We don't talk much about the medieval history unless Byzantium is involved, we dot he schism, crusader and then the discovery of the Americas and the natives
Then we do napoleon, American independence, civil war, then ww1, ww2, Balkan wars, population exchange with turkey and st that point we stop
They do not touch the Greek Civil War much or the military juntas (apart for the polytechnic school event) or any modern history for that matter
There are "sources" as they are called, small extra patches of history for a number of topics and the book does have much history for all that I mentioned but we mostly skip or just mention many of the above
Time is limited and higher focus is given to ancient Greece, Greek-Rome events, Byzantium and ww2
The letter "H" is one of the three "I's" in the Greek alphabet
The equivilant to an English "H" is "X" in Greek, and we pronaunce it "Chi" as in "Hill" (not Chile)
e.g.
Χάος = Chaos but we actually pronaunce it as "Haos"
We don’t have it lol
We use χ and pronounce it like the word “he”
In Greek the letter looks like Χ/χ. There’s no English equivalent but it’s like a throaty h
I know this isn't what you meant but the letter "Η" is pronounced as ee/i in Greek; it is the capital version of the letter η which means the feminine version of "the"
In the romanization of the Greek alphabet it only occurs in the diphthongs "ch" which is pronounced [/x/] and "th" which is pronounced [/θ/]
We have it lol, but it's not related to "h".
It's the capital "η" and it is pronounced like "ee".
> We use χ and pronounce it like the word “he”
Not exactly
We use /x/ or /ç/ while "he" uses /h/ which is a completely different sound
The difference between /x/ and /ç/ depends on the vowel that follows the letter
χα, χο, χου all use /x/ while χε and χι both use /ç/, try it for yourself, say these syllables out loud and you'll notice the difference
Nope, we pronounce all foreign words exactly as you would too, we just write them differently, since the equivilant to a Latin "X"  is the letter "Ξ" (ksi) in our alphabet
E.g. Xylophone, xylographie, xenophil etc
are Greek words so we definitely can pronaunce an "X" the correct way
Έχεις δίκιο. Συνειδητοποίησα τώρα ότι το Ηράκλειο πχ στα Αγγλικά είναι Heraklion
Το Ηράκλειο είναι στα αγγλικά Heraklion για΄τί το ήτα στα ελληνικά έπαιρνε κάποτε δασεία. Το αγγλικό h στις αγγλικές λέξεις ελληνικής προέλευσης υποδηλώνει αυτή την δασεία. Πχ: history, hero, hyper
We actually say Ksiaomi
North Macedonia because I've seen online that they despise us
Turkey for as long as it continues to operate in the manners that they do
well they do have a train tunnel for getting goods into the state, you could probably fit through there
If anything, we should despise them

Best wishes guys,hope you'll get rid of this dictatorship
Στου διαόλου τη μανα (at the devil's mother)
I was reminded of the phrase "at the devil's mother" (στου διαόλου την μάνα - stou diaolou ti mana) by another redditor
I've also heard the slightly altered phrase: στου διαόλου το κέρατο- stou diaolou to kerato, which means "at the devil's horn".
I sometimes also use the phrase: στην άλλη άκρη του θέου - stin alli akri tou theou, which means "at God's other side/edge/point". I'm not sure if I translated correctly
It's used where I live, but I don't know if it's used all over Greece
Στου διαόλου τη μάνα - At the devil's mom
Στου διαόλου το κέρατο - At the devil's horn
In Greece we say Στου διαόλου την μάνα which translates at the devil's mother
We say the same in Greece as well
Dont forget άνω κωλοπετεινίτσα (upper kolopetinitsa, which does not exist afaik) and στου διαολου τον κώλο/το κέρατο (at the devils ass/horn)
I really like στο μουνι της μανας του
> which does not exist afaik
It does [exist] but not as "upper kolopetinitsa", it is "Tritaia" now and it is located in near Itea, Phocis
It was called that \[Kalopetinitsa\] due to the high quality of it's roosters used in cockfights
The name came into prominence following the rather successful 1959 movie "[Vacations to Kolopetinitsa] starring Kostas Hatzihristos and Spyros Fokas (filmed in location in the village)
You really won't miss all that much if you decide to go there; just another regular old village filed to brim with really old folk, nice view to the Bay Of Corinth though
\[Source: My father's paternal village is nearby

Χαχαχα το κερασακι στην τουρτα!
When I was in the US twenty or so years ago, some college students were shocked to see a Greek magazine
They thought we must still be in togas and in little white houses with no electricity by the beach
They couldn’t believe that Greeks can produce a magazine and were especially shocked when they opened it and saw cars being advertised because that meant we also drive cars
Ah yes, the good old "but isn't all of Greece like Santorini
Self defense laws are shitty and in away they help the perpetrator

Same applies for pepper spray, electric teaser
Most of Europe has the same self-defense laws, self defense must be appropriate to the offense
Meaning if someone breaks in and they see you and then run away you can't chase them down with a sword and hack them in the back whether that is in your house or on the street
You are just supposed to call the police and then they beat the shit out of them with their "reasonable" force
Law isn't perfect and a lot of people make fake crime scenes because of it
no as far as i know our military police is only used in military bases and on border checkpoints
The Germanderie (Χωροφυλακή)  was merged with City Police (Αστυνομία Πόλεων) to became Greek Police (Ελληνική Αστυνομία), which is not a military body
It has jurisdiction on both cities and rural areas
&#x200B;
Funnily Αστυνομία means literally City (Άστυ) and law (νόμος) making the modern's force name not very accurate and the old Αστυνομία Πόλεων redundant as it was literally City-Police for Cities
they also have tax police on the borders, port police, local police, forest police
And if that wasn't enough the military also do guard duties in train stations and central squares
It reminds me of Greece pre- crisis
The word "panic" (πανικός in greek) comes from the name of the ancient Greek God Pan
Either because of a foul mood or because he wanted to play a mean prank, Pan used to terrify mortals who would roam in the wilderness
He would hide in the woods and stalk the mortals, making his presence barely felt at the beginning just to cause unease and then all of a sudden he would jump out of hiding with a terrifying shriek and chase them off
The terror the mortals felt when they encountered him like this, came to be called "Panic".
&#x200B;
There's a story about it which has Pan causing panic to the Persians in the battle of Marathon
And a more detailed story concerning Dionysus' campaign against India, which Pan took part of
According to this story, Pan and his allies found himself trapped canyon with very few soldiers at his command
There he instructed his solders at nightfall to start screaming
The screaming became louder with the echo from the canyon and the enemies panicked and fled
&#x200B;
Anyway, the ancient Greeks used to associate this irrational fear that we call a panic attack today with the God Pan, and therefore we have the word "Panic".
Εφιάλτης (Efialtes) = Nightmare, and also the guy who betrayed the Spartans at the battle of Thermopyle
Εγκέλαδος (Engelados) = Earthquake, and also a name of a Titan, son of Tartarus and Gaia, who shook the earth whenever he was pissed off
Νύχτα (Nychta) from ancient Greek Νυξ (Nyx) = Night, and also the ancient goddess of the darkness, daughter of Chaos and sister of Erebus
Νάρκισσος (Narkissos) = narcissist, and also the guy who loved admiring his reflection on the water for so long that he eventually died from it
There's literally hundreds if not thousands of those, can't list them all
That's very interesting
The phrase "panic attack" gains a whole new meaning
Both are correct and mean the exact same thing, with Engelados being a more formal definition
You research a random word we use in our every day conversations and 3 out of 5 times there's always an ancient myth or story behind it
People had to come up with words and names for things, and what better way then using myths and story references to do so
Since Greek is one of the oldest spoken languages still in use it's pretty normal  to discover those references even today
Pretty fascinating thow
In modern parlance it's always "the strike of Enceladus" when refering to earthquakes, and it pretty much only appears in news reports as it's ridiculously pompous for everyday conversation
Nobody will ever say "hey did you feel that Enceladus last night
" for instance, and the word seismos is already pretty formal being archaic itself, it's why we also say seismology in Greek, instead of something like shakeology, which would be the more informal equivalent
Of course we use seismos in our modern parlance for the reason you described, but the fact that you know what an Engelados is without the need of looking it up actually proves my point, I didn't say we use it all the time
It's like the fireplace, using the word fotia or tzaki to describe it, doesn't mean that the word Estia is wrong, or that the other two are the correct ones
Or the moon, we always use the medieval Greek feggari but when someone uses the ancient Greek Selini we know exactly what he's talking about and don't look at him like he's some weird intellectual
I thought you meant Enkelados is interchangeable with the word seismos, which as far as I know does not happen in any context
Estia for fireplace in not wrong per se, but if it happens at all it must be pretty unusual
Closest common usage I can think of is referring to *the hestia of the fire* or *multiple hesties* to mean active wildfire hotspots
Using derivatives of hestia to mean *focus* or *housing* is much more common
Spot on for Feggari/Selene
Oh boooy if that's not a question
We study history a LOT
and over and over again, even through different subjects (such as ancient literature)
We have 6 years primary school, 3 years middle school, 3 years highschool (finishing at 18yo)
I will call them year 1-12 just for simplicity
\*History\*
Years 1-2 you are still baby so at most you learn some ancient Greek mythology
Year 3: From mythology to history (intro to ancient history)
&#x200B;
Year 4: History - Ancient Greece (Geometric Period, Archaic Period, Classical Period, Hellenistic Period)
Year 5: Roman times (early AD), Byzantine Empire (\~500AD - 1500AD)
Year 6: Ottoman occupation (1500 > 1821 (greek independence revolution))
Year 7 (middle school starts): Ancient History but deeper
&#x200B;
Year 8:  Byzantine and european medieval history
&#x200B;
Year 9: Modern History (1821 - 1990)
Year 10 (high school starts): Ancient History (including more diverse civilizations in Asia)
&#x200B;
Year 11: From Justinian reforms (565) until the Treaty of Vienna (1815)
Year 12: 1815-Today in depth
&#x200B;
\*Ancient Greek Literature/History Classes\*
&#x200B;
Year 7: Herodotus Histories (Persian Wars) - translated to modern greek
&#x200B;
Year 7-8: Homer's Oddyssey and Iliad - translated
&#x200B;
Year 9: Arrian - Alexander's Ascendency (History of Alexander the Great) - translated
&#x200B;
Back when I was in school in the 90s we also did a bunch of Religious History (mostly medieval) in a ton of depth, especially the relationship between Orthodox and Catholic church
We also did some more historical texts such as Thucydides History
Bottom line --- we go craaaazy with History
Imagine having about 2500 years of history
We learned mostly about Ancient Greece, the Byzantine Empire, Ottoman Empire 400 years Occupation, and the 1821 Revolution against it
There was no time for WW1, WW2, the period in-between, post-WW2 civil war, and the military dictatorship that followed
It's strange to only learn about distant times and ignore the most recent and relevant ones
Now that I am older I also realise that history classes were mostly aimed at forcing nationalism and pride upon children
Not being taught about recent history, while glorifying the positive aspects of ancient times can fuck up generations
We were never taught that ancient greeks built their civilization on slavery and unpaid woman work
How democracy was only for few privilledged men
How philosophers were executed for their ideas, and how often civil wars occured
I'm not saying it was not a great civilization, but I would have prefered to get a more unbiased view on it
Also, not teaching children about WW2, wtf
Well you can't always study and learn everything but here's how the structure is
Three big time periods
1st: 3500BC  \~ 330AC (The biggest one that we usually skip some of it)
Mesopotamian Civilizations, Egyptians, Minoans, Mycenaeans, City-States, Persian Wars, The Golden Age of Athens, Peloponnesian War, Macedonians, Alexander the Great, The Rise of Rome, Roman Empire until the foundation of Constantinople
2nd: 330AC \~ 1453AC
Basically everything that happened in the Byzantine Empire until the fall of Constantinople from the Ottomans
(Emperor Constantine, Emperor Justinian, Ιnternal conflicts regarding Christianity, The Split of the Western and the Eastern Christian Church, The Crusades and at last the Rise of the Seljuks and the Ottomans)
3rd: 1453AC \~ until today (Here we give more importance)
The Discoveries, The Colonies, The Renaissance, The American revolution, The French revolution, The start and the evolution of the Greek revolution, The Industrial revolution and then the foundation of the first Greek state, WW1, Russian revolution, Balkan Wars, WW2, The Civil War, Cold War and at last the Crisis of '74
&#x200B;
We learn the 1st period at the 1st grade of Primary, Junior High and High School
(10-13-16 yo)
The 2nd in the 2nd grade of Primary, Junior High and High School
(11-14-17 yo)
And the 3rd in the 3nd grade of Primary, Junior High and High School
(12-15-18 yo)
When you go from Primary to Junior High to High School and study again the same time period  the books are supposed to give more depth and detail in the events
man, we didn't even make it to the 1900s
I live in Heraklion of Crete, a coastal town that has a continued existence as a port settlement since Minoan times
It's original Minoan name is not known anymore, if it even had one and wasn't just an expansion of Knossos
It was first called Heracleum after Crete became a Roman province
Which I guess translates as Herakles' city
Though why did they name it that, I have no clue
But that name did not stick for a while
During the Middle Ages, the island fell to Saracen conquest
Crete became an Emirate and in fact, the Saracens did much of the city building there, where as before it was a minor settlement and a port, it was then that it became a full-fledged city
The Saracens called the city Rabd al-Handaq, which means Castle of the Moat
After Nicephorus Phocas won the island back for the Byzantine Empire from the Saracens, the name was hellenized to Chandax (Χάνδαξ) which simply meant Moat
And after the Fourth Crusade, when Crete passed into Venetian leadership, the name of the city was latinized to Candia
When Venetians were ousted by the Ottomans, the name was turkified to Kandiye
And it's only in the modern era, when Crete finally became a part of the modern Greek state, that it's earliest known name had been restored to what it is now: Heraklion
&#x200B;
So to sum it up from a nameless Minoan port to the Roman Heracleum, the Saracen Rabd al-Handaq, the Byzantine Chandax, the Venetian Candia, the Ottoman Kandiye and finally the modern Greek Heraklion
The names either mean Moat or Herakles' City
[Artemis/Artemida]
In ancient Greece it was known as Brauron and was one of the most famous worshipping sites for [Artemis]
It also has a sort of nickname that was official for a while, Loutsa meaning "very wet" Because it was full of sand hills and when it rained it became almost a swamp
Edit: I forgot to mention that it was one of the 12 cities of Attica that Theseus united
The original name of the city was Θεσσαλονίκη Thessaloníkē. It was named after the princess Thessalonike of Macedon, the half sister of Alexander the Great, whose name means "Thessalian victory", from Θεσσαλός Thessalos, and Νίκη 'victory' (Nike), honoring the Macedonian victory at the Battle of Crocus Field (353/352 BC)
The city was created by joining the few villages and towns of the area by Cassander who married Thessaloniki and controlled Macedonia after Alexander's death, in 315 BC
Between the ancient name and it being readopted in 1912 with the incorporation of the city in the Greek state it was known as Saloniki, for many centuries
Athens or Athena Αθήνα in Greek, originates from the known ancient goddess Athena
Wikipedia article about her:
That's dope
iirc a relative told me as a kid that there used to be a church near the centre of town , in ancient times that is , outside of the pathway to koule that was to herakles (not the son of Zeus but the Dactyl one ) that was destroyed and only a part of it remains
idk that might have to do with its name
Huh, didn't know about the first naming
Actually now that you mentioned I have heard that story too
That one of the Kourites named Herakles who acted like bodyguard or baby Zeus and the city is named after him
yes yes thank you thats what im referring to
Roughly "köbnaun". [g̊ʰø̞b̥ənˈha̝u̯n] if you're familiar with the IPA
"Niaou". Don't @ me
Well Greek mythology has
First of all the [Sirens] (which is from where the mermaids are inspired from)
>the Sirens  were dangerous creatures, who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and singing voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island
[Charybdis]
>The sea monster Charybdis was believed to live under a small rock on one side of a narrow channel
Opposite her was Scylla, another sea monster, that lived inside a much larger rock
The sides of the strait were within an arrow-shot of each other, and sailors attempting to avoid one of them would come in reach of the other
To be "between Scylla and Charybdis" therefore means to be presented with two opposite dangers, the task being to find a route that avoids both
Three times a day, Charybdis swallowed a huge amount of water, before belching it back out again, creating large whirlpools capable of dragging a ship underwater
In some variations of the story, Charybdis was simply a large whirlpool instead of a sea monster
[Scylla]
> Scylla was a legendary monster that lived on one side of a narrow channel of water, opposite her counterpart Charybdis
The two sides of the strait were within an arrow's range of each other so close that sailors attempting to avoid Charybdis would pass dangerously close to Scylla and vice versa
> Scylla made her first appearance in Homer's Odyssey, where Odysseus and his crew encounter her and Charybdis on their travels
Later myth gave her an origin story as a beautiful nymph who gets turned into a monster
> The strait where Scylla dwelled has been associated with the Strait of Messina between Calabria, a region of Southern Italy, and Sicily, for example, as in Book Three of Virgil's Aeneid The coastal town of Scilla in Calabria takes its name from the mythological figure of Scylla and it is said to be the home of the nymph
Then although not usually linked with danger or death there were a bunch of water [Nymphs]
Such as the [Nerieds] , the [Limnads] and others
Sirens basically
Yes, Sirens would be the most similar to what OP is describing
I mean we are still part of Southern Europe fam :P
[Here you go]
>Do you have something similar in southern Europe
Maybe living in salt water on the coast
Wouldn't go down well here
Most areas have accents rather than dialects, or maybe use some idiomatic words so it would be rather easy to follow
However people that either speak a dialect or have a strong accent tend to be rather prideful of it (imo rightfully so) and would not want to alter it
But not all people who live in such areas follow the dialect or the accent
Plugs and sockets
Taxes ,laws and income
Souvlaki vs kalamaki
Backgammon
Definatelly backgammon
Whole families are not talking to each other, because of it
It's our national sport
To the people wondering why Greeks spend so many hours in cafés, it is because they are actually backgammon dojos that serve coffee

Mes plus sincères excuses aux Français :(
I love Italy
The vineyards, the northern mountains, Tuscany, the southern villages by the sea, the beautiful churches and art pieces, the culture, the food
I absolutely adore Portugal and Croatia
I kind of have an idea why, but I don’t go a week without thinking of going back to both of these places
I spent a month in Lazio
Best time of my life
Have a good day
I'll go with EU-issued, cause I often see confused looking faces when I show my "Hellenic Republic" passport
Would love an actual EU passport
I cannot for the life of me fathom why recent Greek passports only have "Hellenic Republic" written in Greek on the cover
More often than not I actually have to open up a page to prove it's Greek, 'cause guess what; not a lot of people outside Greece read Greek
Fancy that
Are you talking about [this] ?
This song isn't very very popular in Greece generally speaking
Κεφάλι, ώμοι, γόνατα και δάχτυλα
Κεφάλι, ώμοι, γόνατα και δάχτυλα
Ματάκια, αφτάκια, στόμα και μυτούλα
Κεφάλι, ώμοι, γόνατα και δάχτυλα.
The lyrics are exactly the same as in the English version
With the only exception, that in that line "Eyes, ears, mouth and toes"
the body parts are in demunitive
I did but the music was usually either 90s pop or the classic children’s songs like μια ωραια πεταλούδα etc
Maybe they had this one but I never payed attention
I had no idea that we had that song in Greek as well
I am shook
I remember this in kindergarten
Really
Didn't you go to playgrounds when you were little, in birthdays
I have never heard of that song either
Only the classics like Μια ωραία πεταλούδα, Κούνια μπέλα and Γύρω γύρω όλοι

Most disgraced is Akis Tsohatzopoulos
Coming from the left/centre-left wing then-ruling PASOK party, he was a prominent minister and almost became prime minister in 1996
His second wedding in Paris was seen as Gatsy style and provoked anger and then he became one of the very few convicted for corruption
The populist opinion here is that everyone is a bit corrupted and there are many former and current politicians that divide the masses and are very hated but also very loved by the people
But 'Akis' is seen as massively corrupted and there is propably not one person willing to defend even one thing he did in his career, when other politicians have many apologists defending them
So most disgraced is easily him
There is an english wikipedia article on him so you can see some more infos
The most prominent thing is the 'Siemens Scandal', the pinnacle of (known) corruption in Greek politics
Alexis tsipras propably
in greece its rock pencil scissors paper but no one actually uses pencil because no one knows what it does
exactly this, i always assumed it was because it sounds better
ive seen so many thoughts and opinions on what pencil does, but the whole point of the game is that each "thing" beats one and loses to another
That's only in the South, in Thessaloniki there's no stupid pencil
I hate the pencil addition, it ruins the mathematical balance of the game
Without the pencil, all options have 1/3 chance to win, 1/3 chance to fail and one 1/3 chance for a tie
With the stupid pencil however, rock and scissors have 2/4 chance of winning and pencil and paper have 2/4 chance of losing
Fuck the pencil
It's the same order in Greece, 'Πέτρα, ψαλίδι, χαρτί'.
Crazy, especially hârtie
Is this a personal attack or something
~ 200 but I buy some imported food too
I could probably do ~ 100
If they lived here permenently then yes I would let them vote as long as they had citizenship and did military service, I would also strip away that right from Greeks who live permenently on another country
In Greece we have opa and my favourite malaka
Συμφωνώ τώρα ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ )
"Μένω με το στόμα ανοιχτό" in Greek
Exact same
In Cyprus maybe
I can certainly talk to Cypriots even though there's a chance they'll only understand me without me understanding them
Same with Danes and my level of Danish
I think I wouldn't have a problem with German when it comes to travelling
**Maybe** I could talk to Spaniards as well but I'm not sure about that
As far as southern Albania
After that, I'd have to speak either english or french
I'm pretty sure most would try to be understandable but I'm only talking about the Cypriots' casual way of speaking
Oh and don't get me wrong I love how expressive your dialect is, compared to standard Greek

Albania of course
We joke about Albanians and the fact that some of them steal things
Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Germany, some jokes with French and Italians
Russia (as always), sometimes Germany, but mostly Greece itself (the common North - South "rivalry")
Edit: Albania as well
We tell a lot of racist jokes about Albania and Bulgaria
Also about Pontic Greeks for some reason
We also have a lot of jokes in the form of: There was one Italian, one British and one Greek etc
Same in Greece
Amazingly, both of these jokes exist here too, only with altered nationalities: on the first plane the Greek throws out the Albanian (can't remember the others);  on the 2nd, it's the American, the French, and again an Albanian instead of the Turk
Racist jokes due to the mass influx of Albanian immigrants back in the 90s.
its afternoon here
1^o C. I'm wearing  short pants and a hoodie and feeling warmish
i'm at home it's around 19-20
a cold room is 17 and below
for clarification i live in the east coast of Attica where it rarely goes below 0 (at best once a year)
I have the Ac trying to mentain a temperature of 22C in the living room
The temperature in the rest of the house is at 18C a bit cold but not realy a problem
I spend most of my time in the livingroom
I have also a Dehumidifier to mentain a humidity around 50%
The temperature outside is 15°C so it's probably a bit higher than that inside
But 15°C indoors is pretty cold imo
There are efforts
There are definitely safe neighbourhoods in Athens but you couldn't pay me to go to Omonia or Menidi at night, I like my head exactly where it is
Athens is relatively safe in most areas, as far as stick ups are concerned
Pickpockets are a thing in the centre, but assault is not really an issue in most areas
well in Artemida it's kinda creepy because the road lighting isn't the best and they don't cover everything every part of town but it's pretty safe
How did you convince yourself to go in
We have [Bouzouki] (spelled somth like: "booze" - "ookee") which is, from what I know, of Turkish or Anatolian origin
We also have [Tabouras]
a musical instrument with Byzantine origin and [Baglamas]
[Rebetiko] is a music style that uses Bouzouki and Baglamas
[Here] is a video with many Rebetika (Rebetiko-style songs)
Edit: Fellow Greeks could maybe give you a more detailed answer, since there are also many different types of "national" music worth learning about
We have local traditional musical instruments, for example in northern Greece it’s the klarino, in Crete it’s the Cretan lyra, or the flaouto, etc
Ans because we don’t want to fight each other on whose musical instrument represents the country, we leave it as it is :)
My city, Heraklion of Crete, had been under siege by the Ottomans for 21 years, back when the city was called Candia and was under Venetian rule
It is the second longest siege in the world, after that of Ceuta
The invasion of Crete started in 1645 and the siege of Candia (Heraklion) in 1648 and lasted until 1669 when it ended with Ottoman victory
Many claim it was because of treason that Candia eventually fell, when a Venetian military officer defected to the Ottoman side and revealed to them, the fortifications' weak spots
It took a lot of effort
It wasn't all in one go
The current borders were shaped as much with conquest and re-conquest as with treaties
Most of the expansion, after the initial state had formed, came after the Balkan Wars, that's when Crete became Greek again too
But for others, it took longer than that
For example, the Dodecanese which we got back only after the second World War
I'm going to wear a pin with the flag of Luxembourg and walk around with a sandwich saying "Dat ass hot"
Be polite, honest and open
Enjoy your trip, you're worrying too much
Try new things, get involved, learn a few phrases/words in the locals language if that helps you get familiar with the place, and smile
Not American smile which looks forced and fake but a genuine smile whenever you truly feel like it
There's all kinds of replies along the lines of "Just don't be a dick, relax, be reasonable, use common sense" etc, etc
I really don't think that translates well due to things like cultural relativism and all
So I'll say this; *be observant*. Don't double-check yourself every time and get stressed out, that's not what I mean, but observe peoples' behavior and just try to make your way around the place along those lines
I'm saying this because Europe isn't one big homogeneous landmass, much like the United States
I'd never pretend that advice given to help you move around Greece would apply to moving around Sweden for example
Just keep your eyes and ears open, be receptive, take it all in and enjoy the place
*When in Rome, do as the Romans do* and all that jazz
I'm Greek (duh, hence the flair) and my husband is American
When we first started dating, he he'd get livid with me getting to the date late
I didn't do it on purpose, I wanted to look gorgeous and kept missing the damn busses (I lived 2 hours away from him)
Anyway, he'd go on and on of how awful that was and he even implied once the relationship won't work which I thought he's a drama Queen, but no it's cultural
All that while he was living in Athens
It took me a while to explain to him Greeks don't show up on time and he slowly started seeing the same pattern with other Greeks as well
He is still very punctual, like when he needs to go to an agency or shop or something, but we're living in Greece so he has to wait for the Greeks to arrive late, lol
It doesn't bother him anymore and he now sees how different life here is, he even has managed to relax in general
"If it happens, it happens" attitude
For me, I think the first thing that I noticed, was the obvious distress of him when for example they wouldn't have a product we needed in a certain shop
Any other Greek would just smile and look to another store
My husband would do an obvious eye roll and exhale which me and the people working there would find it rude
I once told him about that, apparently he was doing it without thinking it was even obvious and was quite surprised everyone thought that was rude
He avoids doing that now
He still *hates* waiting in queues (I don't) but ever since we've had kids it has thrown all his schedule all over the place and now lives in a limbo state of going with the -Greek- flow
So basically, Americans like to be punctual and can't be patient
Once they chill they're fine
My husband is American and I swear to God, he yells more than I do
Our house is like a gigantic woofer
If I'd miss the bus, two hours
Obvs I'd text and explain what's happening and not to to wait for me yet at the usual spot
Although he had been living abroad since he was 18, it was the first time he lived in the south and the first time punctuality was a problem since when his Greek friends would be late he didn't really pay much attention as they never had a set time
If they were around, they'd go for a coffee
No, I think it's both
Americans from what I've encountered don't have patience and Greeks are almost always late
We just need to find each other in the middle
I had to take the bus and the station was already far
If I was working in the morning and then had to dress up and run, yeah there would be times I'd miss the bus
When he would come to my town I would always be there already
Yeah we're obviously all brown duh
Yup completely agree
Gosh those Marxists are a lot more capitalist than I thought
we were colonizers but now are colonies are either dead or called italy and we have an awesome relationship with them
biggish for Greece, city here
with that money you can buy property in the outskirts and build a nice house over 100m^2
otherwise an apartment close to 200m^2 or a two-storey house with a small yard
From most of the answers what can someone conclude is that real estate prices have skyrocketed pretty much everywhere in Europe the last 10-20 years
Salaries have not followed not even slightly
How is our generation supposed to afford housing seriously
The average salary in EU-27 is 1,695
00€/month
I haven’t seen/heard, and correct me if I am wrong here please, any single country taking some initiatives to provide affordable housing for newer generations who want to start their lives/families
Has EU budget ever included some money focusing on helping europeans with housing
Has EU parliament ever even discussed about the housing crisis that new generations are dealing with
And if they have, what actions have been taken, where and when
I am very curious to know
4 70-90 s.m apartments, rent them out for 500€ a month, make 2k a month, live comfortably for the rest of my life
Literally ALL of Monastiraki Market, it's filled with tacky tourist shops with overpriced poor quality tourist crap about the Acropolis and the ancient greek world and poorly pressed T-Shirts with cringy Greek stereotypical one liners which are probably gonna fade after a few times in the washing machine, not to mention the huge amount of pick pockets in the square and the narrow roads
When visiting Athens, do yourselves a favour and after visiting the Acropolis dont bother with the tourist shops of Monastiraki, if really you want to buy some souvenirs, just enter one they are all exactly the same anyways, then go eat in one of the tavernas in Monastiraki or something, (except Bairaktaris, somehow this is an unpopular opinion with some Greeks, but their food is crap, and their restaurant is filthy, dont @ me), and then leave
Greece is filled to the brim with islands, you don't have to spend a fortune on Santorini and Mykonos, there are literally thousands of islands just as good as those and you'll pay 1/5th of the price with just a fraction of the tourists
Oh boy, where to start
Since our main industry is tourism (you can imagine how well the pandemic is going for us), it's not a lie to say that most of our country can be viewed as a tourist trap, if you visit the most common places
Start with Cyclades islands
Almost every single one of them
Santorini
Our most overhyped and expensive island, for no apparent reason
It's a sunset, you don't have to pay 80 euros in order to take a photograph
Santorini has ZERO nice beaches
Like, ZERO
Everything is black, due to the volcano
Mykonos island
Also a trementous tourist trap
Everything is extremely expensive for absolute no reason
While the island is beautiful, you spend a minimal amount of 60 euros per day, just to eat and swim

Guys don't go to Psarrou, unless you want to come out with every bacteria known to man
Milos,Serifos,Amorgos etc beautiful places but you have to give your kidney in order to spend 5 days there
Point of view, travel to Dodekanisa(apart from Rhodes) or the Ionian Sea, or my favorite, Crete
Beautiful, colorful places with reasonable prices, nice food and there's everything for everyone
Even better take the tour of Peloponnese by car
GPS works wonders here
Koroni, Methoni, Medieval Mani etc
And please
Don't believe everyone that says, "eat this, it came from my village".
Well actually I went to see the Little Mermaid when i visited
Wasn't disappointed because i wasn't expecting anything monumental but I actually enjoying taking a walk to reach the statue and then trying to step on the rocks to get close for a some funny photos
I share your opinion, Bairaktaris is absurdly trash
Totally για τον πούτσο pita, dry and not tender and the souvlaki was 80% fat and 20% charred fat
I don't think it's an unpopular opinion, deep down we all know it lol
I should add that mykonos and santorini are just tourist traps shaped like islands
If you don't have insanely deep pockets but you still want to visit them do your best to avoid popular restaurants, don't stay overnight and leave without ever looking back because they might charge you for it
This is what I advise to foreign tourists, visit Athens for 2 or 3 days to admire things like the Acropolis, Syntagma, Sounio, hell even Piraeus if you hate looking at nice things, but then just get the fuck out of here, it literally has absolutely nothing else to give you tourism wise, take a bus and go to Delphi, or Meteora, or most of the Peloponnese, or take a ferrie from Piraeus and go to an island, preferably Crete
Athens is only worthwhile in moderation unfortunately
Don't worry, most Greeks would agree with you
If you are interested in history you should visit Athens for a couple of days and then head out to experience the land's diversity
Why do you hate to say it
Try to find a non-Athenian Greek that disagrees with you
THANK YOU, I thought I was going insane, because IN MY DAY, everyone I knew hated Bairaktaris, everyone was saying that Savvas and Thanasis were light years better, that his Tzatziki and Souvlaki were rotten trash
BUT THEN I go abroad for University and suddenly Bairaktaris is the best restaurant on this side of the hemisphere
This is the sort of question that only an american or an english brexiter could make
English is taught in a lot of countries, has a lot of media to practice with and motivate you to practice
It also has quite simple grammar
German-->Greek Auto-translation:
>Wir schreiben nur in Englisch, es sei denn, es steht auf den U-Booten des Landes
Eine automatische Übersetzung würde wahrscheinlich zu seltsamen Ergebnissen führen
Γράφουμε μόνο στα αγγλικά, θα πρέπει να μεγαλώνουν σε υποβρύχια της χώρας. Η αυτόματη μετάφραση θα οδηγούσε πιθανώς σε περίεργα αποτελέσματα.
Greek-->English Auto-translation:
We write only in English, you have to grow up in submarine country
Automatic translation would probably lead to strange findings
Street level is called ΙΣΟΓΕΙΟ (ground floor, literally equal to earth)
Above that we have 1st, 2nd etc ΟΡΟΦΟΣ.  I would say ΟΡΟΦΟΣ has an implication of being above ground level and you would never say ΟΡΟΦΟΣ 0 even if elevators assign it this number
Ground floor (isogeio - ισόγειο - means equal level to the earth/ground), and then first floor above
I think it's only the Americans that consider the ground floor to be a "floor/level". In Greece anything above ground level is considered a floor (orofos - όροφος)
You forgot some like central heating, the concept of citizenship, plumping, Lighthouses, Algebra obviously Feta cheese among many others
You are just flexing at this point
iirc it was among the many things the refugees brought to Greece with the population exchange of 1923
At least that's how we have it where I live
Weren't Cyrill and Method Byzantines
Cause they invented your alphabet based on the Greek one
I also have the feeling that half the Balkan countries claim them for their own
We regard them as Greeks, you as Bulgarians, the Skopjans as "Macedonians", etc
I had to check wikipedia to get my terminology right, what we have around here (I live in a suburb of the Piraeus) is tahini rolls not tahini pie
They usually prepare it during the fast before Easter
I don't know about cities, but there are definitely some regions in Athens and Thessaloniki that are weirdly named
Péfka - Pine trees
Neápoli - New town
Foínikas - Palm tree
Kalamariá - Squid town
Oraiókastro - Nice castle
Peristéri - Pigeon
Sykiés - Fig trees
There's also Kastoriá, which means beaver town
We have many "Saint X" villages
And the moat popular saints get many villages - I can't even remember how many Saint Johns and Saint Georges there are
Same here
We have like 15 places called new town
Yes, thank you
Ketchup ruins most stuff and it's basically only good for fries
People legitimately eat pasta with ketchup, drives me nuts
Well I prefer mayo for fries too but I meant, like, fries are the only food that should ever be acceptably eaten with ketchup
Cons: prosperity, lack ofdevelopment, stagnant mentality, day-to-day racism
Pros: Just look out the window and at the view and you forget everything else, great food, chilled and warm people
Pros:Good Weather,Very good people,nice night life,fking amazing food
Cons:I would've said economy but thats getting better,and you have to serve 9 months in the army
Pros: Good food, lots of sun, landscape diversity (mountains and beaches), most people are kind and outgoing
Cons: Low wages, the orthodox church is too involved with what should only be the state's responsibilities, lots of unemployment, drivers are bad, public transport is bad, people are too loud (well that might not be too bad for some), and our cities have got to be the ugliest and dirtiest I've ever seen
Cons: Cold weather for people who aren’t used to it, racism, homophobia, all very grey and depressing, government, prejudice from the rest of the world
Pros: None
In all seriousness, the nation is beautiful when it’s not grey as hell
Πού μένεις ; Διότι εγώ οταν κοιτάω έξω απο το παράθυρο στη Θεσσαλονίκη και στην Αθήνα βλέπω απλα μαύρες κατεστραμμένες πολυκατοικίες και σκατά δρόμους.
Development είναι θετικό, μάλλον εννοούσες κάτι άλλο.
Seriously I love Bulgaria but every time I'm outside Sofia and Plovdiv , the people seem to really be struggling there
I constantly ask myself why Nordics don't like their climate, only cause I'd love it, but then I remember that we don't like the climate here even though most would love it lmao
Γενικα το εννουσα, οτι οπου και να πας στην Ελλαδα εχεις αυτο το μπλε που δεν το 'χεις πουθενα. Μενω μεταξυ Αθηνας κ Σαντορινης, Αθηνα οκ παω πασσο γενικα, εκτος αν εχεις καλη θεα.

I love rain and moodiness but my dopamine addicted brain doesn't, so I feel you
The Soviet anthem
No, I'm not a communist, it's just awesome
Katyusha, amongst other Russian songs
Every time I hear Russian choirs I get chills even thow I can't understand a word they're singing
And before someone asks, no, I'm not a communist or even remotely associated with the particular ideology
Idk but the one I find more fascinating is the eruption of the [Thera Volcano] on Santorini Island
It happened while the minoan civilization was a thing and it's debated to be the reason for it's downfall
Santorini used to be one island and it literally split into 3 by the explosion and a huge tsunami hit the Aegean
We don't eat Mousaka nearly as much as foreigners think
Most people eat it once or twice a year, on special occasions
Same goes most dishes you'll find in a tavern
What we eat day-to-day isn't nearly as elaborate as dolamades, for example
Also, we rarely drink ouzo
Most people don't actually like it and those who do know it gives you the worst possible hangover
I often hear about the "greek breakfast" of yogurt, honey and nuts
The real greek breakfast is frappe, cigarette and aspirin
It depends form family to family
Mousaka takes a lot of time to prepare so naturally you don't have time or are willing to do it in middle of the week
Dolmades is even more time consuming and hard to make
One could also argue that it is expensive
So it's not that we don't eat them, but then you are working for minimum wage and a gazillion of hours of course the average Greek won't eat Mousaka every week
Personally we always had these kind of foods on Sundays, be it pastichio, Mousaka, Dolmades etc
Because you had time to prepare on Saturday
Oh BTW Mousaka is a seasonal food since you need eggplants to make it (that is to make it good) and fresh eggplants are not available throughout the year
So in my house we will eat e
Pastichio at least once a month but if it's eggplant season, mousaka takes it place
Since they are pretty similar dishes with a few base ingredients being different
Finally it matters a lot where your parents and grandparents come from
I can say that 2/3 of my friends didn't eat nearly as good as I did but I was privileged to have a pontic Greek grandma who was untouchable when it comes to food
Naturally the daughters got a lot from their mother but there are still some foods that grandma was am undisputed master at
Φασολάδα σαν της γιαγιάς μου δεν έχω ξαναφαει.
Yeah, of course every household is different
We only ever made mousaka or pastichio when we had relatives coming home from abroad
Now that I live alone I make those more often (when I have friends over ect)
As for dolamades, I think we only ate them on Sundays during lent, maybe a couple times during the summer and that was it
Yeah
I've worked at a couple taverns and I can attest that people like ordering it more than making it, probably because it has a tendency to turn kitchens into war zones
\-Gifting someone cologne means you'll have a bad fight
\-when someone looks good you have to do a little "ftou ftou"(pretend spitting) so you don't give them the evil eye(mati) but only grandparents and mothers do that these days

Fight me
The hot weather
People think it's awesome because they only stay here for a week as tourists
It's basically impossible to do anything productive from May to September because of the heat
Even walking to the metro station 10 minutes from my house is tiring
Our cities are so ugly, it gets depressing
No sign of nature
Just a dirty bunch of white, graffiti-stained concrete
Aerial views of our cities literally look like wastelands if you squint your eyes
The countryside (especially in the northwest) is far, far more beautiful, but you don't have access to city-life facilities there
Trash trash everywhere
*insert the buzz meme here*
nah it's the most common thing among us balkans
17:00 in Greece and even THAT feels depressing
We don't. Personally, I just die inside and let my body go into autopilot
Honestly that was surprising even for us, hasn't happened before
10-15 during november/early december is unfortunately common though
That's not really normal but the climate is ruined
I saw a documentary about Phoenix recently and I was terrified lol
~Elon musk wants to know your location~
Happy cake day
Shit, I didn't even know
How fitting
I spent almost half my day on Reddit
Thanks
Propably the cyclades Islands, the people are nice (mostly) the environment is pretty, the food is good
Absolutely none
Except, maybe, the city of Nafplio, the first capital of Greece
Umm
Crete, I guess
Everyone seems to love it
I would say that Lidl is the no1 meme in Greece for the last few years
Anything that can be considered cheap in a low quality sense will be memed as being from lidl
*Something* breaks-> *something* is from lidl
I read articles last year that the company will actively try to change that perception and the meme has indeed toned down
But generally it is one of the popular market chains doing very well all those years
We make jokes about it but most people here love it
There's loads of  jokes and memes about its supposed "low" quality products (Lidl brands, like Silvercrest etc
Either way it's always filled with customer's and I've honestly never had any problem with something I've bought from Lidl, value for money 9/10, until now
Bad quality, cheap price
In Greece when people want to say that something is of bad quality or that it's a cheap knock off, they might use the phrase "[something] from Lidl". Make of that what you will
Personally, I don't think they're bad
They have some stuff that are quite good actually
What she/he "should" do is up to her/him
What's with the attitude, are you affiliated with Lidl
Your inferiority complex is showing
Curb it
I should be able to joke about everything I want, but since you are thirsty for a joke about my country then I got something for you:
The quality of our economy is equal to a lidl product quality
Jokes aside lidl is quite popular here and these jokes have actually died down quite a bit, because their products are actually much better than they used to be
I remember getting 2 infrared heaters from them about 5 years ago and they would break down 2-3 times every week
They have improved the reliability of their products a lot since then
I didn't choose to be from Greece, nevertheless Greeks joke about their country a lot
They just don't care about ignorant *jokes from lidl* about Greece like yours
Προς τί η απολογία; Απλά κάνε αναφορά και γραψ' τον/την.
Yes, absolutely
It has always been the norm for girls and boys to hang out together without meaning anything else
Nobody thinks anything of it
It would be very, very odd if someone pointed this out as being weird in my country
Yes, no problem at all
Of course this thing changes when you have to deal with the perception of older people, but yes, it's absolutely logical
Yeah definitely, one of my best friends through elementary and middle school was a girl
Here it's pretty common but it usually ends in one liking the other
Reciprocated or not many times it ruins the friendship
Most of us simply say "yes
" Even in formal calls
Or we say "tell me"
We usually say "παρακαλώ" which translates to either please or you're welcome
It's a polite way of answering the phone instead of saying "hello" ir smth
when I'm in a cheeky mood I answer with words/phrases like "yo
", "talk", "come on"... otherwise a simple "yes
well we gained our independence from the ottomans in 1821,but we have existed for thousands of years
We became independent in 1830 (big thanks to England Russia and France)
But we've been a "nation" for like centuries
Greece as we know it today basically came to be in 1830 (we've switched between being a kingdom and a republic quite some times since then though)
However, the "Hellenic-wide idea", as it was called, which was basically the first ever mention of a Greek nation that would unify all city-states, was first expressed in the 5th century BC by pre-socratic philisopher Gorgias
1830 actually
Having a name for the place is not the same as being a country
All islands have names although the vast majority is part of a larger country

Welp I'm having a cultural shock right now
"Dada" with an emphasis on the a's kind of like saying yes in Slavic languages back to back
Nope, we did not
But the quality of the food there helped me start cooking for myself
So jealous
These are important skills that will set you up for life
Here, if you go back 3 - 4 decades women had housekeeping lessons
All the older women in my family recall it fondly
I wouldn't mind at all
There are many jobs you can do without speaking the local language
No, I don't think we have any such tradition
Not anything I can remember nonetheless
I know a big number of them
My neighbors are mostly grannies and my mother she talks with them sometimes
I live in an outskirt of thessaloniki and im pretty close to like 1-2 of my neighbours who are elders and then i just have some casual talk with the others
I think that, in the cities, most neighbours have a typical "just nod and smile" relationship, but I personally prefer to avoid any kind of contact lol
Shit I also do the last one
Thats the most greek thing ive heard today
Check flag(So lt is spies then)
Regularly an hour to an hour and a half lately
I don't know what it is
Luck
Or rather, lack thereof
I'm really not comfortable around crowds either, which makes it worse
And we're talking about just 17-20 damn km, that's it
I'm not even in some obscure suburb of Athens, it's just an absolute aeon to get where I'm going for some reason
And unless it's later at night, everything's just jam-packed
The only saving grace in all of this is that at least there are railway alternatives to buses, which means Time of Arrival is more consistent
Anything within 4 or even 5km I'll gladly walk, sometimes even more if it means avoiding long wait times and being shoved into a train or bus
One thing that's been some comfort is the fact that I've resorted to taking a book along with me
Yes, I know, an actual book
It's great actually holding a physical one again
Something I've always found rather perplexing is that often the commute exhausts me more than actual work
Like, I know you're technically just sitting or standing, but it feels like sensory overload every time
Obviously what also affects my impression of the commute is the usually lackluster income or type of work that rarely makes it worth the trip
All of the aforementioned things are part of why I've been meaning to move out of the city, or even out of the country altogether
I'd be way more content even attempting to live in a more rural economy with everything that might entail than having to regularly commute through an urban maze

i got a Lazaros in my class too :D
In Greece we have plenty of women named Artemis, it's a dope name
Also some Apollos (Apolonas in greek)  although it's much rarer
Unless I leave the country, I don't see how I could live by myself before late 20s/30s. The reason most people stay with their parents even if they do have a job that pays a less crap wage ( 750-800 euros is considered good for starters ), is that money is barely enough to survive
So most people prefer to keep living with their parents, spending a few hundred for entertainment while saving the rest
If they work to support their family or their wage is lower ( like most young people ), then living on your own is even more unrealistic
Second that
Even young couples need more than 1500-1700 combined to stay together
Also paying for rent, utilities etc, mean you can't save enough money to buy a house anytime, so taking a housing loan is pretty much the only way to get a house aside from inheritance
I would say inheritance is the only way
No sane person would take a housing loan from a bank in Greece where the economy could be destroyed in the next crisis
Not to mention the deposit and interest rates ...
Well yeah, but paying rent all your life is   .. sad
Too bad I only inherit stuff at the countryside
Greece is, in fact, younger than the United States
During WW1 and again during WW2, there was an attempt to create an [Autonomous Aromanian state] within the borders of Greece
Both times it was sponsored by Italy, but both times it failed
The perpetrators, who were Greek citizens, fled to Romania (their considered 'homeland') where they were convicted by Romanian communist courts of fascist collaboration
To this day, Greece still has the largest Aromanian population of any country in the world
What happened to the bucket
Where did they mainly  go
Germany and Austria or directly USA
Hey we did too
Una razza una faccia high five
Similarly, when we gained independence, the country was only 36% the size of the modern-day country
It was just in *1947* that Greece's shape and size was finalized
We still have yet to reach 100 years since the country took its definite form
Not sure what your country is, but according to [this map] it would have been within the borders of Greece only
Cool
Someone was advertising german lessons on the Berlin metro
In greek
Also a life hack video on yt had a greek supermarket in the background
People saying "Opa" really isn't all that common especially in the way it's used/known around the world
Our first king was Otto of Bavaria
His name was Greekified to Othon and he gave his name to the uni he founded (the Othonian University of Athens)
However, he was removed from power in late age and the university of Athens was renamed after an earlier politician who had nothing to do with it (Kapodistrian University of Athens)
Most Greeks have no idea who the real founder was
Ioannis Kapodistrias was the first Governor of Greece after the Liberation from the Ottomans
Kapodistrias was the one who introduced the Greeks to potatoes
When he ordered the first shipment of potatoes,  he ordered that they be offered to anyone interested for free
However Greeks were very skeptical and they didn't take any of it
Therefore Kapodistrias, knowing of the contemporary Greek  attitudes, ordered that the whole shipment of potatoes be unloaded in  public display on the docks of Nafplion, and placed severe-looking  guards guarding it
Soon, rumors circulated that for the potatoes to be  so well guarded they had to be of great importance
People would gather  to look at the so-important potatoes and soon some tried to steal them
The guards had been ordered in advance to turn a blind eye to such  behavior, and soon the potatoes had all been “stolen” and Kapodistrias’  plan to introduce them to Greece had succeeded
We had a larger population as Byzantium (15 million) than now (11 million)
John Capodistrias, who was a statesman, is quite known for bringing the potato to Greece
If you go out on the streets and ask random people who he was, that's what they'll probably tell you
so all we need to solve the climate change is to invade russia
I'm a student of Kapodistrian University and I find it quite disrespectful that we removed his name like that
Without Otto and his family there would have been no university
Lol ok
Fun fact: That wasn't a fact
Pretty sure you didn't
Not the Northern part
Why is it called Cyrillic and not something like Clementic
Dude I mean the Bulgarians in general
Well it was cyrillus and methodious (idk how to spell it) who made it they weren't Bulgarians they started from Bulgaria though
Actually they made it in Bulgaria but first taught it in Russia
Yeah but the Cyrillic alphabet came from that right
OK so it was the glagolitic but the Cyrillic was based on that right
Well I guess that's it but it doesn't if it was made by the two dude whatever though
Brace yourselves Bulgarians I am coming next month
Thanks I'll probably go through there since I am going by car are there any places you recommend in Sofia
OK thanks
Personally, I'm in love with them
I was in Sweden as a student and i could not believe there was a blackjack table in nearly every pub
That's crazy and trust me i know crazy,im greek
Even in the student pub inside the campus
Like
what do you expect to happen
Drunk students will lose all their money
Our ancestors  weren't gay
They said no homo before every interaction
That we were a country in ancient times
The first time any type of "Greece" existed was when we declared independence from the Turks
Before that, Alexander's empire was a unified Greece (without sparta which remained unconquered), but not called that
[Secret schools]
Before the ottomans there only was the roman/byzantine empire and for the brief period of time between these 2, it was once more a few scarcely populated strongholds + stronghold cities, which were cut off from constantinople but not yet conquered
Wouldn't really call any of these greek
That is correct, sparta had already lost all power and influence by that time
It would offer Philippos (Alex's father) nothing, and conquering it would still cost him some soldiers
So he tried to scare them into surrendering by saying something along the lines of "If you don't surrender, I'll burn you to the ground" to which the spartans replied with a kinda famous one word letter, "If". And both went on with their business
Yep, woodstoves are present in some Greek villages
It's a perfect feeling listening to the fire in the woodstove burning while watching the snow
It has become more popular here due to the crisis, but it remains mostly a rural thing, rarely seen in the cities
Well I think the Macedonian empire leans more to good but of course it was an empire how good could it be for the ppl they enslaved
The byzantine empire I'd say neutral
The campaign started before the winter and it ended before the winter started
Yeah but some of the town Alexander conquered have him as a hero and others not
Well I guess so XD I mean I just remembered they did do some good stuff like making the Cyrillic alphabet
I'm not really sure since there are more than one and there's not only one that's very famous
I searched it, but no luck
Giorgos Papandreou for sure, he's the one who put us under the EU supervision with the first agreement which many politicians now agree that they knew that before signing it that it would bring disaster to Greece, but they did sign it
Also I would say Michaloliakos who's the leader of the Golden Dawn a.k.a the Nazi party
And the most hated Greek politicians ever (random order):
Our both dictators
Alexis Tsipras
Nikos Mihaloliakos
Giorgos Papandreou
Kyriakos Velopoulos
And more
Mind the gap please
You mean toasts
Are you talking about something like a toaster grill ? Because literally every night I make a pair of toasts with
We don't really have those toasters that heat up only the bread
tostaki
That's a kind of tough question for Greece given our bad modern reputation, because of the debts
But, I'd say after reading almost all of the comments I have more ideas as to how we contributed to the EU International Community and Europe
**The past:**
Firstly, the Minoans and inventing the first building complexes, tools, artwork, writing systems and trade networks
Of course I'll mention the ancient Greeks influencing the Western culture, languages, architecture, sciences, philosophy, astronomy, mathematics etc
Many Greek inventions are now being used in everyday life
Like *construction* cranes (waterlifting cranes were invented in Ancient Mesopptamia), probably the first Aquedacts[1], [Arcimedes' screw] [Cartography/maps] [gears] [the escapement] [the tumber lock] [plumbing] urban planning, showers, central heating and many more
(got tired and didn't put a link in the last ones)
Ancient Greek and Greek words are used nowadays to describe many of these sciences and terminologies in all sciences
You'd be really impressed by how many of these words are Greek
If interested, you can have a look [here]
Greek was a language in which both Bibles were written
Then the Byzantine Empire, that were basically also Romans, influenced the religion of the region making many neighbouring countries/regions Orthodox Christian by sending apostles
Byzantine scholars and literaries made a great contribution to the preservation and copying of classical manuscripts that enriched the Renaissance in Western Europe
**Modern Greece:**
Many say, that because we were able to counterattack the Italians and push them back, when they attacked us, Germany had to send a big proportion of its military divisions to fight Greece and thus prolonged the attack to Russia, making the Germans attack in the winter and thus helping Russians and the Allies win and buying time for the Russians to further mobilize before the attack
The credit is not to be given only to the Greeks here, since the Brits, New Zealanders and Australians helped *A LOT* during the German attack of Greece
Apart from it, one could say we are the place that took the big hit of the immigrant waves coming in the EU with the goal to go to major European countries like Germany
We are kinda left on our own to deal with a really big number of immigrants, with funding from the EU to build all the concentration camps for them
Germany and some other countries have received many immigrants, with Germany having about 1 million, but the twist here is that these countries naturally take only the educated ones and sometimes unattended kids
We are a country where many Europeans spend their holidays on since we have very cheap prices and idyllic scenery
Many of you probably won't know, but we have the biggest fleet of merchant ships worldwide
Influencing the transportation of goods internationally and in the EU
>According to LLI data, Greeks control more than 18
8% of the world dry bulk fleet and 19
8% of the world tanker fleet
>The Union of Greek Shipowners cites independent data indicating Greek owners account for 53% of all EU-controlled shipping capacity and 51
3% of all tonnage under the various EU member state flags
The dominance is even greater in the dry bulk and tanker sectors

thank you bros
Grazie Italian bros
Ay high five
Wow are you describing Greece rn
Danke mein Deutscher Freund
Thank you for saying that, even though you're a German and could easily want to defend German's position instead of seeing it factually
That's true
And we are really thankful for that mon amis
That's mind-blowing
Here we start taking English in 1st grade and another language in 5th grade (usually German or French, some people do Italian or Spanish)
Edit: Plus Latin in the humanities and Ancient Greek from the 7th grade on
Quite a bit, admittedly
Learning foreign languages is mind altering, and, in my opinion, extremely important in a child's mental development
I agree 100%
Lazaros Christodoulopoulos
I'll say Ephialtes of Trachis
You forgot Alexis Tsipras
the man who sold Macedonia
or is he too "socialist" for your taste my friend
(Φιλικά πάντα και χωρίς να υποστηρίζω όσους ανέφερες ηδη)
Not like he had an option mate
What would you have him do exactly ?
[Police (MAT) violence aimed at unarmed woman] during the 17th of the month which is a national holiday for the [Athens Polytechnic uprising]
Prolly the Koskotas scandal
Greece and turkey are the same
We have it in southern Macedonia too but we call it paprika
I will ask my mother who makes it if she knows the word ajvar
It is really delicious
Pita is the Greek word for burek
Strange to appear in Bosnia
Ministry of Defense here too, I doubt anything suggesting offense exist, I assume in countries where it's not named ministry of defense it would be something like ministry of military or something like that
in Greek it's  Υπουργείο Εθνικής Άμυνας (Ypourgio Ethnikis Amynas) meaning Ministry of National Defense
It is actually called Ministry of National Defence, Υπουργείο Εθνικής Άμυνας (Ipurgio Ethnikis Aminas)
You are right
My mistake
That's interesting, but considering Austria Hungary was an empire "Ministry of Defense" doesn't sound that prestigious
Again, I might be spouting bullshit but that's what makes sense to me
That's really interesting
Cheers for the info
I don't like feta, last souvlaki I had was 6 months ago, not a fan of ouzo and I'm not really a beach person
I'm expecting to be taken behind a barn and shot anytime now
I only mildly enjoy pastichio and the last time I had gyros was about a year ago because it's extremely rare and expensive in Cambridgeshire :(
Ι hate ouzo, it tastes like dish soap mixed with alcohol, and I hate the sun and going to the beach cause I turn into a lobster
A really sweaty lobster

I'm hella introverted, i don't enjoy going to clubs at all
With night life being **the** way most young greeks "socialize" i'm often the one guy in my friend groups who is always like "nah, i'm good"
it's treason then
I'm not a beach person either
No one in my family can swim because according to my mother "we're mountain people
" I hate the summer and the heat, all I want is rain and cold
They're gonna take away my greek citizenship any day now
Feta is good with gemista and fasolakia, but otherwise it's low in the list of my favourite cheeses
I think there's a huge portion of us that aren't a beach person
Most greeks on reddit probably
during a trip to warsaw I heard it wasn't very catholic originally, isn't that true
I don't have a problem with him keeping it as long as he declares that macedonia is in fact in greece, and not the name of some slav country that speaks bulgarian
That's Cyprus
I dig that actually
But if you want a proper cheese from Greece, Metsovone is the way to go
Ditto on hating summer
I'm expecting the order to turn in my passport any day now
As a person born and raised by the sea my heart weeps for you
In all seriousness though, I get it, it's not really easy to be able to stand both
Extreme cold and heat that is
That could very well be the case
I'm a massive fan of spirits from Votka to Akvavit, to Raki, but Ouzo always tasted like peer pressure
it's mostly what the old people drink honestly, most guys under 30 won't even offer it or recommend it
I'ts good, just nothing special
Most young people don't drink ouzo
I however
Like it a lot as a 21 year old
Always awkward when they ask you how many times you've been to the beach
the answer is ZERO
It will always be zero
Leave me alone
Oh, I'm from a coastal city, I actually do love the sea
I just hate the beach and heat in general
The way I explain it to people usually is "I like to look at it, but from a safe distance" lol
"Do the Chinese"=Κάνω τον Κινέζο (Kano ton Kinezo)
It's when you act oblivious of what's happening around you deliberately
For example, someone asks me an uncomfortable question or a question I would rather not answer and I "do the Chinese" by changing the subject or acting I didn't hear them
same with chinese being incomprehensible and greek being studied in school
People who do not smoke
Police officers get a % for writing tickets so many now it will finally change
[This one] did a pretty good job describing everyday life in various places
You can find all 4 episodes on yt
In Greece instead of celebrating birthdays we mainly celebrate "Name's Days" which is the celebration day of the saint you're named after
So everyone with the same name as you has a party on the same day
So on a given name's day you pop around from party to party hosted by all the people you know of the name being celebrated
For example, if you're name is Eleni, you'll throw a party (on May 21st for Eleni) and your friends will all come visit for a little while, then eventually head off to another Eleni's party
Same
I've always found it weird
I think my opinion is quite controversial but I'm gonna go with Alexander
He was cruel, greedy, narcissistic and delusional
We decided Eastern Thrace and Smyrna wasn't enough, so why not gobble our way to Ankara
EDIT: It didn't go too [well
Join the Eurozone
Big oof
i haven't really seen many other than the standard EU one but i really liked the swiss ones
and personally i hate how boring the [Greek ones] are
Good Internet connection
Aldi
We used to have one but it was closed 10 years ago
I feel you
Germany is very weird in some issues
The only European country where you can actually get fined for downloading torrents
Seems pretty conservative
One of my favorite restaurants i've ever eaten at actually has been a German cuisine restaurant here in Greece (tho it was run by a greek couple who used to live in Germany so not sure if they changed things up at all with their recipes) but i loved it
Don't be too down on German cuisine
this doesn't apply to Greece and more than half of eastern Europe because we don't use the Latin alphabet
but in greek there is ξ and  Ξ (capital) for some reason I write capital Ξ with a line going vertically in the middle
Ƶ  looks coll tho so I might start using it for capital Ζ (the other one is very different, ζ)
without the line but i've come across some very old teachers that use the line
Edit: in our alphabet lowercase z is ζ and capital Z is Ζ so this only applies to capital
Capital Ζ and small ζ. But Ξ can be handwritten as  Ƶ  or with a more vertical line (I still do it when I'm writting fast) but this is NOT how it's taught in school
Small ζ and ξ can get pretty fancy depending the person
Well, a Z with a line in Greek would be misread as a Ξ
Greek is Ζ and ζ.
We also have Ξ ξ which is pronounced as "Ks" and I've seen some people write it like Ƶ but it's rare
To clarify, Ξξ is pronounced ks (x) and Ζζ is pronounced z.
Ƶ is another (uncommon) way to write Ξ in greek (not Z), and I have seen people write the lower case ξ as a ζ with an extra line crossing it horizontaly, much like their capital counterparts
i don't know what Ξ has to do with Z but the only people i've seen write  Ƶ  are people atleast 60 years old
also you have to clarify that Ξ makes a X sound
True, true
Yeah I know, but we're talking about the letter Z saying how X at the start of a word in English becomes a Z doesn't change that
Anyway just a slight observation mate Καληνύχτα
It's a bit uncommon I think
It's a bit more common area in girls I think because sometimes parents make a name out of the two they've given them
Sometimes it works, sometimes the result is extremely pretentious
I'm so jealous of people that have a middle name
Pretty rare i think, I've personally seen it once maybe
drinking sodas instead of water
That's my exact thoughts
Why do a lot of houses have glass doors
And about a dozen glass windows as well
That's like begging to get robbed
I would be so afraid to live in a house like that
I wear shoes indoors
[This Pharmacy in Piraeus looks pretty cool]
I would like to say we have many, but Greece has kind of stayed behind a little apart from a few projects
The reasoning behind this is definitely the economic situation in Greece, bureaucracy, and poor organization which leads to investors foreign and national, being disinterested in investing here
Some Greek modern architecture of Athens (the city I lived in for the biggest part of my life) includes:
* [A pharmacy]  [in Argyroupoli]
* [Another pharmacy] (also added by another Redditor)
* [Rex Theatre] (1937)
* [Hilton Athens Hotel] (1963)
* [Athens Towers] (1971)
* [President Hotel] (1978)
* [Peace and Friendship Stadium] (1983)
* [Athens Concert Hall] (1991)
* [National Museum of Contemporary Art] (2000)
* [National Bank of Greece] (2001)
* [A building of Hellenic General Insurance Company] (2006)
* [Acropolis Museum] (2009)
* [Onassis Cultural Center] (2010)
* [Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center] (2016)
&#x200B;
In Thessaloniki:
* [OTE Tower] (1966)
&#x200B;
Other parts of Greece:
* [Porto Carras Grand Resort] (1973)
I think all pharmacies are made to look like this so that you can easily spot them in an emergency, so they are required to have at least one bright green cross sign
Is that thing around it supposed to be Conway's game of life
Acropolis definitely
I suppose phone salesman (?) Can't think of anything getting hate-hate by all, but I haven't met a single person not finding them annoying af, unless they've blocked their numbers
Another candidate could be the Units for Reinstatement of Order, but I guess that goes into political territory
Oh and the guys checking the metro tickets, although it's not really their fault, just ppl are getting caught having no ticket and blame it on the universe
Also taxi and bus drivers are getting a lot of hate
Crisis ?
I'm going to be honest with you
I don't know what happened, because my daily life didn't get affected
and I also didn't bother searching
Oh I guess something did change: I couldn't use certain credit cards online because of some "Capital Controls" or whatever
I didn't really understand what happened so I'm not really the best person to ask
I thought I was weird for staring down the bus driver to telepathically indicate that I wanna get on, lol
From Czechoslovakia to Yugoslavia
Cool
Serbian for sure
I like how French sound put probably will never get a chance to learn them :/
Definitely German and Spanish
Finnish sounds great as well
same on french
Germany
Haha I have a lgood laugh at them and do them myself, but they can be tiresome at times
Aww ty you neighboors we love you too
And now kith

Duolingo is not good at ***teaching*** you a language, but it's good for learning vocabulary in grouped sections
I haven't looked at Greek though
i used it to learn a bit of dutch & french
its not bad if you work on it every day and treat it seriously
If you want to learn Greek, I can completely vouch for [Language Transfer] It's completely free, they're basically 10-15 minute Soundcloud clips (totalling 4 hours I think) and it teaches you the language naturally, there's basically a volunteer student along with the teacher (Michalis) and he starts off by teaching you a few words, and then prompts the student to construct sentences, and you hear their back and fourth, and throughout the course you learn the grammar of the language and how to think in it
I used language transfer to get a foundation in Italian long ago, and now I'm trying to learn French, and I used their french course to get a foundation too
From what I've heard, their Greek course is also great (and it's complete Greek, not just an introduction)
Also, as an addition to the above-mentioned Language Transfer course, you can start getting a feel for the Greek language by watching Youtube videos, I recommend [Easy Greek] they also add English subtitles to their videos
I heard a few clips, and while they're amazing content-wise, just be aware that Michali's pronunciation is not perfect
He's Cypriot, but from what I know he grew up in Spain I think, and learned greek later in his life, so that explains his accent, so yeah, if you want to perfect your accent just know that his is not 100% native
I myself am also probably going to do the Turkish course sometime in the future, but I want to keep consistent with my french a bit first, have you heard the Turkish course at all from curiosity
Fortune tellers
Stealing money from the citizens and the government, if you are a politician
People who litter make me sick, they're fucking degenerates
I feel you
We don't really have any modern ones just random scary stories
The only one that I can think of is the Night Hag (Μόρα, móra in Greek) that most people believe or say they have experienced but that's basically sleep paralysis
It's an unwritten rule over here, it's not mandatory to bring drinks to a party but everyone will consider you to be a cheapskate  if you don't.
Same here
It actually originally was a reference to slaves, and later on it became "chimney sweeper" and other things, the idea that he is a chimney sweeper exists in the Netherlands too
Ehm no
Our TV channels are playing mostly American, British & Greek movies
Sometimes they play also Spanish, Italian & French movies as well and in some local channels i saw a number of obscure Canadian movies
German movies pretty rarely
Turkish movies used to be popular here in the 80s thanks to the Videoclubs
Stereotypes that Greeks don't work hard and have lots of debt have always annoyed me
I'm all for jokes, but I've found that many northern Europeans seem to think these characteristics are actually true
In reality Greeks work [more hours per week] than almost all other Europeans and have [totally average levels of personal debt] almost exactly the same as a German citizen and less than those from France, Sweeden, the UK, or the Netherlands
Now the stereotypes about us all smoking, saying malakas constantly, and being obsessed with Greek history and being Greek
Now those are all pretty damn true to life
Bah, I hate that bit about surrendering
Awfully ahistorical and insulting
I was considerring to reply, but you covered pretty much everything
Another one that's funny as hell but not true is how we every day eat bougatsa for breakfast and pitogyro with tzatziki for lunch
Every
Single
Day
While the only eating potatoes is obviously BS and famine jokes are shitty to say the least
I will say that during my time in Ireland I was definitely served A LOT of potatoes
At least as someone coming from a country where carbs are mostly in the form of bread, pasta, or rice
I mean, I did eat bougatsa pretty much every day for breakfast my first year of college
But that was not a sustainable way of life
>Another one that's funny as hell but not true is how we every day eat bougatsa for breakfast and pitogyro with tzatziki for lunch
Every

Apparently you've never met me
Exactly
And I guess during this year your dinner was also retsina and every kind of liquor you could get your hands on
Which is also not a sustainable way of life
Never tried it, but it sure looks delicious
Yeah i hear that souvlaki places in the states can be hit or miss a lot
I'm lucky cause were i live there are about 5-6 different ones next to my house and they are all really good
That said i'm not actually consuming as many of them as i used too at some point in my life
depends on how windy it is for me
Low 20°C s if it is windy, light jacket, but if it is not windy anything above 20°C is good enough to wear just a t-shirt
As someone raised in NY and living in Greece right now, just seeing the responses here makes a lot more sense to me
I feel comfortable at 8°C and up, but get so shocked when I see people wearing coats in 20° here
It is definitely man made
You do not need to be a nuclear scientist to see that
Just common sense: If you cover yourself with a blanket you will get warm
As simple as that
Now you get it
I am not talking about saving the planet
This is an other discussion
I am just stating an obvious fact: Global worming is man made
Περικλής (Pericles) - Athenian politician of the 5th century BC, which is nicknamed 'the golden century of Pericles' in our history books
Μέγας Αλέξανδρος (Alexander the Great) - He conquered countries all the way to India before dying at 33 of an unknown disease
There are also a lot of people from the revolution of 1821
Well, we have a few to say the least lol
Alexander the Great, who conquered everything from Egypt to modern Pakistan
Leonidas, with the famous battle of Thermopylae
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle for their work
From more modern times, some warlords of the Greek Revolution like Kolokotronis, Karaiskakis
*Lets see:*

All of my grandparents died in WWII except one, my Grandpa
He fought in the war, was taken prisoner, escaped and continued to fight
My parents were born during the war my Dad became an orphan, or technically raised by his older sister
My Mom was raised by her aunt
My Mom's Dad is my only Grandpa that I met and he remarried after the war
He also fought in the civil war and lost half his right arm
Oh yea and my other grandparents were part of the population exchange with Turkey
One of my grandparents was born in like 1890
- My late grandfather was in the air force during WWII but he flew only once then he was stationed and German occupation ensued
he was harboring communists during the civil war (although he was right winger)
- The brother of my grandmother was a communist guerrilla and the government, during the civil war and for few years more,  had him on a wanted list for execution
he managed to not get arrested (and executed)
for some time he was hiding at my grandfather's home
- my great grandfather was cavalry captain during WWI/ Balkan wars
his unit was the first to enter Ioannina (a city in northwest Greece) and liberate the city
My ancestors were the first to introduce chocolate in Greece
That's why all the dark chocolates here have their last name, Pavlides
My parents took part in the [student uprising against the military dictatorship in 1973] Both of my grandfathers took part in the [resistance movement against Nazi occupation in the 1940s] My great grandfather took part in the [campaign for Asia Minor from 1919 to 1922] Earlier ancestors of mine have most definitely taken part in other national wars and campaigns since our history for the last 200 years is full of those
My grandfather took part in the resistance movement in Greece during the nazi occupation in ww2
My grandfather fought with the communist rebels against german occupation during WW2 and my grand- grand father fought against the Ottoman empire  , 4 times he was summoned to fight for his country,
Welp
The climate is probably a huge factor
+No olive trees
looool
Europeans need to stop with this shit
If you think there is no racism in Europe, get out your house
I hate this "Europe is a post racial world" attitude some users in this sub seem to have
There is **huge** nationality discrimination in Europe as it is, let alone actual racism
Same
In Greece we say Box instead of Boxing
Greek too
Except for 'footing'.
True, but we don't say 'jogging' either
We pronounce it jaw-kin for some reason
Thanks
I kinda hate it tbh, but I can't change it
The Parliament
Everything unfortunatelly,especially in athens
I'm fairly certain I haven't seen any comments from Greeks because no one knows where to start from, the amount of stuff that's wrong with our education system is overwhelmingly high
Learning ancient Greek is mandatory, you have little to no freedoms, no phones allowed (although many teachers don't enforce that rule, the fact that English is not taught properly but it is still mandatory for pretty much your entire school life and that religious education is a thing for 2 hours every week
The first that come to mind are:
- A lot of stuff need memorization which most students keep doing throughout the year and it isnt really effective
- In religion class the students are supposed to learn about the different religions but in reality they learn only about christianism
- students still gather and do the little christian prayer every morning before classes begin
- Because of the permanent teachers and the lack of evaluatuon many teachers dont do their jobs properly or at all
Which traditional dish of another country's cuisine proved to be a pleasant surprise when you tasted it
I knew nothing of the Irish cuisine before visiting the country, so I had no specific expectations
I sure wasn't expecting to fall in love with Irish fish chowder, especially the one I had at Dingle
Edit: Thank you all for sharing such delicious dishes and making me aware of them
I'm HUNGRY all of the time since yesterday, but it's well worth it
I think that's about as authentic as the experience of Greece can be (although I would change the beer for tsipouro)
First time in Ireland, my husband was getting invited to a party by some locals in the pub, while I was drinking beer and talking about the European economy with another local outside the pub
It's this friendly and easy-going attitude that I encountered in Ireland that made me feel like I was at home
The cucumber in tzatziki is a refreshing touch
It's an integral part, because it contributes to tzatziki's balance (both in terms of taste and texture)
As for Greek salad, you can ask them to skip the cucumber the next time you'll think of ordering it :)
Never had them, but they do look delicious
These are also like little kebabs, right
Never tried it, but I am all for British scones and fish & chips
I have never tasted Georgian cuisine, I'll see if we have a Georgian restaurant here in Athens
Btw, I love spinach
I want a papanasi like NOW
Didn't knew it existed, but now that I've seen photos of it, I don't think I'll be able to forget it
I am accustomed to a stuffed cabbage recipe similar to samarle  - our version is called lahanodolmades
I absolutely love Italian cuisine, but a couple of pasta dishes I had when I was in Rome were too al dente for my taste
Do you also cook your pasta so al dente in Finland
I thought it had to do with how I am accustomed to eat it, that's why I ask
Paella rocks
Goulash was a pleasant surprise for me too, just not in Prague but in Gyor, Hungary
I don't think I've ever tried a soup that I didn't like
It's this homey feeling that a soup creates, which make it impossible not to love it, regardless of what it's made of
I would easily try them
They are already red, I wouldn't want to make them more furious by rejecting them :p
Turkish food is really nice
I have spotted a couple of restaurants in Istanbul through the net, where I specificaly wish to go to experience their culinary delight
I should make a shepherd's pie at home some day
I think I'm going to like it
Not my cup of tea
Do they really serve it for breakfast
Did you also have Alsatian wine with that
Don't know why, but the first thing that I'd wish to try if I ever found myself in Alsace would be the region's wine
Wow, that mix of culinary influences sounds amazing
The sauce in this dish must be very tasty, judging by its ingredients and preparation method
So, basically this is steak tartare from pork
Is that correct
Isn't it risky to eat it
From what I know, pork, unlike beef, really needs to be cooked in order to be safe for eating :/
We had exactly the same pierogi experience in Warsaw :)
Crusty on the outside and creamy inside
I'd definitely try them
I've had my fair share of gyros pita ;) Never had bifana though
Is this different from the goulash soup
I had that once
Wasn't bad at all
Never visited Prague or Czech Republic in general, unfortunately
I'm planning to visit a Czech restaurant in my city, though, to try the cuisine
You say "greasy potato ball", I say slurp
I do not if it is the same thing or at least something similar, but cured herring here is a first class mezze for one to accompany his/her ouzo or tsipouro
Personally, I love it
Go "haring"!
You don't remember how it is called
Made me curious
Melting cheese
Yes please
From all the African cuisines, the Ethiopian one is definitely among the first three that I would like to try
I am surprised at how many fans haggis has :)
I wish I had some Belgian fries right now
I went to Evrytania for the first time before all this covid staff
It's a Greek prefecture totally unspoiled by tourism (I've been told that very few foreign people visit this place, which isn't grand even in terms of domestic tourism), full of stunning natural beauty
I was in awe
Anyway, I met an old man who wanted me to try his chestnut jam, infused with honey
God
I came back with three huge jars, which I never want to let go
Just today I was telling my father how I wish to visit Morocco
He's been to Morocco, and among the things that he remembers from that trip he took 35 years ago is that he couldn't eat anything while he was there
I don't think I'm gonna have that problem
I know of only one town here in Greece where they serve frog legs: Ioannina - never been there
And I was 15 when I visited Paris - there was no way I would eat frog legs back then
So, no frog legs for me, yet
Fresh seafood, I second that
Heavily spiced with paprika
I'm sold
Fan of liver here
Never knew, though, that there is such thing as a liver sausage, wow
If it's not too sour, I think I'd like that
Thank you for this culinary trip
You can have my share of Greek yoghurt any time you wish
The few times that I HAVE to eat it (I never WANT to eat it) I can only make myself do it if I pour a lot of honey on it
That said, I have no problem eating tons of yoghurt-based tzatziki
The dish that striked me more on your list is the French one
Tripes are intestines
I just read a recipe of it and it sounds a rather fatty dish
As for the other four, I could eat any of them anytime
This sounds interesting
What is its texture like
Fluffy or chewy
You made me want to sit at that table with the green beans, the bread, the cheese, and just slowly sip my wine
Parfait
I know that some Greek restaurants abroad even have Greek producers directly send them stuff, so that they can not only cook Greek, but also deliver dishes that have a genuine taste of Greece
I hope someday you'll come visit us :)
I like steamed buns
I believe snails are very tasty in whichever way they are cooked, not having tried the French way though
I haven't been in Germany, but I was reading an article a while ago that the variety of bread in a German bakery would blow your mind
That was an interesting fact for me
These little places, where there are only a couple of people in the kitchen cooking only a few dishes per day and not laying in front of you a miles-long menu I think  are the best
I'm not very fond of sweetbreads, but give me some liver anytime
I've long wished to try some pasteis de nata, I'm sure they must be delicious
Haha, you drew a nice picture there
I'm amazed at how many people love haggis
Not because I do not like it (never tried it), but because I was under the impression it didn't have many fans
I totally agree about Polish pierogi
As for lohikeitto (which I had never heard of till now), I think I'd liked it
Never had any of them, unfortunately :(
Thanks for this
And I totally agree with your last remark
This is definitely one of the most 'weird' dishes I have come across in this thread
Although it shouldn't be, as there are people here in Greece who eat the sheep's head (they mainly make a soup with it), so it doesn't ring far away from home
It's just that I can't even make myself picture a sheep's head on a plate
That said, I'm glad that it was a pleasant experience for you :)
Hahaha
Same here, friend
I could live on soups
It's been 25 years since I went to Paris and I only remember of the croissants I had for breakfast
I don't think that's because everything else was bad (I would remember if that was the case), but probably because I didn't get to try anything memorable
I have only tasted strudel here in Greece (which, of course, I liked)
I guess if I had the chance to experience it your way (breakfast, mountain, tavern, hiking), I would be drooling about it
Wow
I had no idea that you like tacos so much
I just read that you also have taco Fridays
I'm stunned
You should, since you liked it so
Also
Petra <3 (Never been there, but this place calls me like a Siren)
I'm only familiar with Swiss cheeses and fondue, but the rest that you mention doesn't sound bad at all
As for Swiss wine, I didn't know that was a thing :D
It must have been oenomelo (wine with honey)
We look forward to welcoming you again :)
I have enjoyed the food in Belgrade, Serbia and in Dubrovnik, Croatia (oh my, I just remembered that I have had a to-die-for shellfish experience in Mali Ston, Croatia
From my limited experience, I tend to agree with you and I would also like to see more Balkan national restaurants rise to fame
We eat kokoretsi here (sheep's liver, heart and lungs wrapped in intestines)
What's more, I could eat one by myself - I love it
So it's not what's in haggis (although I don't get what oatmeal is doing there), but rather the stomach part and its whole appearance that make me never want to try it
Can a person not be disgusted by intestines, but find a stomach appalling
Apparently, yes
Oh wow
I airbnbed in Ireland and I didn't come across it
I see
Even so, I think I would be hesitant to try it
I am glad, however, that both of you not only tried it, but enjoyed it so much too :)
Noted :)
Could it have been [lamb kleftiko]
Makes sense
Thanks for the insight :)
You should come visit us again then, when you get the chance ;)
Representing Greece here
I prefer the flag of the 1st and 2nd Republic (they are the same ) instead of our current one
Its simple,  easy to remember and to draw, with historical meaning etc
If I was PM I would change the flag in a minute
However there is one symbol that is highly controversial
The phoenix
The phoenix was used since antiquity as a symbol of rebirth in Hellas
It was also highly used in the first days of the republic , as a coat of arms,  state seal, even currency
However the military Junta of 67 used and since then it associated with ultra nationalists and authoritarians
We need to take that symbol back
The word Μαλακα
There's no way someone hasn't heard malaka being said by a Greek in TV or a game
I'm glad I'm not the only one who does that
Oh damn I need to start saying that, whenever I get asked that I just say "Well, what the f do you want me to say, then
Δεν συγκρίνεται το κάτι με το κέλκε σοζ όμως!
Χαχα έτσι είναι αλλά είμαι και μισός Γάλλος οπότε έχω και τα δύο options ;)
Εξιουζέ μουά τότε, έχεις το ηθικό πλεονέκτημα να χρησιμοποιείς και τα δύο!
So uh, we're in the Balkans
Obviously Turkey, they are kinda threatening us on the regular because our EEZ is made to include every single island we took back from them and they don't like that, I can see why
Albania, nationalists on both sides are dumb
FYROM because of the name dispute and different interpretations of history
We've been kinda chill with Bulgaria but we sort of went to war twice in the 1900s I guess
I'm trying to not create any drama lol
They think that ancient Macedonians were Slavs and spoke that Bulgarian like language they speak eight now, even if the Slavs weren't even in the area yet and we have literal writing from Herodotus calling Alexander Greek and how he participated in the Olympics
Yeah though I have no idea when it happened
Yes actually
In fact the prospect of yielding to Turkish interests is called filnandization over here
Távli it's played by almost every Greek
And I think it's called Backgammon in english
Aye Greece too, we really are very much alike at the end of the day
Same here
Not cities actually, but islands, I think this fits here
With some exceptions of course, tourists keep all going to santorini and mykonos, and there are a lot of other great islands which imo are far better, that foreigners don't know about (though there are always foreign tourists too, I'm talking about general knowledge)
It really depends on what you want though, if you just want an international luxurious experience with greek landscapes but lacking the greek culture experience etc
go to mykonos/santorini
But if you want to go to a beautiful island, that has an amazing ambience, is riddled with greek culture and all that sort, go to [Spetses] for example, it's imo one of the best islands but very little know about it
I looked it up on Google trends and basically Patras is a big one with about 250k pop, without being necessarily the most famous
Next biggest that isn't well known is Ioannina with about 160k population
[here is the Google Trends graph comparison of the cities ]
Not British but I know Birmingham from the show Peaky Blinders
I expected it to be a relatively small town as I had never heard of it before
Very surprised to find out it is the second largest city by population in the UK
Sturm has helped Graz with recognition
Also, Ionian islands get so much less love than they should
No one outside of Greece has ever heard of Evvia, even though it's our second-largest island with nearly 200,000 people

That we are lazy
We are, but only during the summer
The heat is just something we cannot deal with
I can feel my IQ declining every day from 11 AM to 6 PM
EDIT:We are "lazy" because it is unbearable not only to work during summer, but it is unbearable to even exist, we are in the verge of physical limits
Foreigner approved, I really do miss gyros
Yeah, it's not a laughing matter
Deaths from the heat rise a lot during the summer in Greece
I'm currently in Hannover, and we had like 37 for 3 days straight
People in my workplace just couldn't work, they were laying around , trying to cool themselves and eating ice cream
Imagine having 38-42, high humidity, every day for 3 months
Its unbearable
You just cant function
And it's totally understandable
Last night was awful, I agree, I couldn't sleep up until 12
30 o clock
The truth is I'm going back in Greece in like 1 month so I wont be here for the autumn :(
Even in Crete where they have lots of wind , the temperatures are still like 39+during the summer
I'm from Thessaloniki, northern Greece , and during mid July up until late August the temps are 38+. The wind doesnt really help in my experience
Sony forget that its not only the heat,  but it's only the sun
You can get REALLY sick if you are exposed under the sun for many hours
Having worked on the bars and cafes during the summer, I know that .
I know bro
Always apply sun cream often during the summer and while under the sun, it's literally a life saver !!! But all in all I totally get you
i'm not entirely sure but from what i gather it has been changed 4 times democraticaly (one of them being a very big change) and 2 times by a dictator
Σκίουρος Skíouros (Skée uros)
The most common word is **Σκίουρος (Skíouros)** pronounced [SKI-uu-ros] This is actually the origin of the English word Squirrel
It comes from the roots σκιά ( which means "shade, shadow”) & ουρά (which means “tail”)
There is also the less common word **Βερβερίτσα (Ververítsa)** pronounced Ver-ver-I-tsa (where you roll the r's)
Except for the rolled R I don't think there's anything about these words that would be difficult for non-native speakers
We call it skiouros in greek
And it comes from skiá + ourá (shadow + tail)
Huhh, in Welsh it's squirrel=wiwer
Interesting connection
For some reason I'd never made the connection with ουρά before
Then again it's not a subject you put too much effort into
In some regions the word βερβερίτσα (ververitsa) is used, with its origin being slavic
VERY prominent in Greece, though mostly on senior high school
I don't think I knew anyone that didn't go to private after-school tutoring at least on the last year, when we have our national exams, if they wanted to enter a university
Exactly
During the last year of high school, the amount of information that is included in the curriculum literally cannot fit into a normal school year
So teachers ask students to get extra tutoring to strengthen the knowledge that has been hastily covered in class, but also to cover topics that will never be covered but are still likely to show up in the national exams (they're a big deal)
Some schools, depending on their budget and availability of teachers, offer free classes on some afternoons taught by the same teachers
But often it's only for some key courses and you're meant to find a paid tutor for the rest
I can say that without the afternoon classes and private tutoring I would have had to take the exams a second time around
In Greece we put them in the fridge too
Oh definitely fridge
They're perishable
It's probably the souvlaki-kalamaki debate between Thessaloniki and Athens
I side with Athens on this one
Whether kalamaki should be called "kalamaki" or "souvlaki".
Greek here
Kalamaki (South Greece) vs souvlaki (North Greece)
I draw the line at price
Ryan, Wizz, Vueling etc are cheaper than trains
Only if it's possible to take the train, I obviously can't go from Greece to Sweden by train for example
I have taken the train from London to Paris before though
All other trips I have done have all been by plane
It's a mixed economy, there's literally no country on earth which is a pure free-market economy
If Sweden is ''democratic socialist'' then almost all major countries in the West are democratic socialist because they're all more or less similar
The UK, France, Germany, etc all have large welfare states, public education, health, transportation, etc
This is considered ''socialist'' in the US but it is not
Those feats are standard for liberal democracies everywhere
Honestly, I can't think of anything, it's usually pretty accurate
oh, in central athens you actually always can see the Acropolis
Are we in any Hollywood movies that are made by non-Greeks
Far as I know to them we are a myth
my big fat greek wedding, mamma mia, mediterraneo (not Hollywood), captain corelli's mandolin, Never on Sunday (prolly the best known in Greece)
Good thing I never saw it then
Learned quite young, like 4-5
Had my fair share of injuries the next handful of years though
Take something like the 4th crusade and the Byzantine successor states
If the mix of crusaders, bulgarians, infighting byzantines, turks and the level of intrigue and bloodshed that accompanies them isn't good enough for you, I don't know what is
Early 20th century Macedonia
Something like RDR2 but with Greek and Bulgarian guerilla fighters
Tbh all of byzantine history is better than Game of Thrones
Some nationalists and racists call the turk "Mongols", but it's not really common, it's only used among them
We sometimes call the Turks Uruk Hai :)
In Greece it starts with the prime minister refusing the free entrance of Italian troupes through mainland with the expression "Well, then I think we have a war" (before that we just learn about the beginning of the war and how Greece tried not to get involved at first)
Then it mainly consists of battles and plans from the allies, cruel actions within borders and then the road to Hitler's fall
I am now starting my final year in High-School and until now we have never done a lesson on WWII, maybe we talked about it a little bit with our teacher but it was never required to be taught
All that I know about WWII is by my own research and curiosity
I am from Greece btw
We managed to kick Italy's ass, then the Germans came and helped them but then we helped the Italians when we changed sides
We also have something in our books about throwing shoes at Mussolini
Actually I didn't know it was not a common knowledge that Mussolini started his own "crusade" and on the process joint forces with Hitler or the whole Greek thing up until recently
Also we we're taught that chapter mainly through songs against fascist italy sung by the rebels
That part was briefly mentioned before we went on the biggest events with Germany
I actually believe that they just don't want us (as kids at least) to know about the bad thing our ancestors did
No country ever is just evil or a saint
All of us can be both
Under no circumstances I believe that Greeks we're always the saints and the other the bad guys
But the history books I had during school years mention nothing about the times Greeks did bad things to other people and I know for a fact that they did those things
A saying goes like that 'Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it
' that's why I think it's important to learn about the good and the bad things
So as not to make the same mistakes again
Oh boy
I'd say like roughly around 3000 BC until 1974 AD
&#x200B;
but seriously, nationalist particularly romanticize between 1453 and 1821 (The Turkish occupation)
While the time *was* often quite a bad time for Greeks, it was also often a fine time for Greeks
Nationalists paint it as a constant horror show and use that narrative as an excuse to not like all sorts of minorities and foreigners and so on
1967-1974
### Military dictatorship (1967–1974)
Pretty much everything
But their two favourite are the dictatorship of Metaxas, 30's up until the occupation of Greece by the Nazis ( yeah, the Metaxas didn't really care) and the dictatorship of Colonels, or of Papadopoulos, from the  60's up until the establishment of the Third Greek Republic and todays shitshow
Yea, just like u/FlmSavage said it's not popular at all anymore
I'd say most Greeks recognize it as the nationalistic anger fueled power grab that is was
Perhaps understandable at the time, but not something to aspire to today
You'll occasionally hear older Greeks still be genuinely sad specifically about the failure to reclaim Konstantinoúpoli but more with a patriotic homesick feeling and less in an angry nationalist way
Even the crazy far right nationalists don't talk about it with much seriousness
Dictatorship
Some Greeks (mostly ethnicists) think that Papadopoulos saved the country (which is false) and we wish we had a prime minister like him
Thankfully they are the minority
In some places and in some tavernas in Greece they serve quails, partridge and guinea fowl/hen
We especially eat rooster, and have many dishes that have rooster (yeah technically chicken)
I personally haven't eaten any other type of bird as part of Greek traditional cuisine
I am completely fascinated by norilsk, it is one of the most interesting cities i've ever read about
Yes it's depressing as hell, but can we talk about the temperature there
Like how do these people live there when the average temperature is below -10 °C ?
I mean the lowest temperature i've experienced here in Greece is around 5°C and i thought i was gonna freeze to death lol
I have a heavy Cretan accent
Girls from north Greece love it
It has almost the same effect like when an anglophone girl hears French
But as you can understand there's also a lot of mocking and especially from the Cretans who live in the cities or west Creta because they say that this accent is for villagers
Abroad I've had some mockings but generally people like it
Also nouns like ο/ η αβαρής, το αβερές
Guess I need to come to France for my next internship now  in Greece it really depends, many will give you at least school credit but in the USA, most internships are unpaid
Slave labor if you ask me
One posting was a 6 month contract of 40 hours per week (and you needed to be "flexible" with your work schedule) and had no benefits (so you pay for transportation, private health insurance which is hundreds per month, etc
This was for the UN
I'm not sure about the stuff you specifically requested but my sister moved to Germany while pregnant and when the kid was born my sister and her husband have been getting child care subsidy (I have no idea if this is the correct term I basically put the Greek term in Google Translate) from Germany even if they both have Greek citizenship and my sister barely speaks English let alone German (her husband speaks both)
impressive
to be honest the only thing I loved about Manhattan
While I mostly like NYC (the diversity and vibrancy of the city are amazing), I thought the subway system could have been more user-friendly, plus it needs an overhaul
I wasn’t too impressed with the skyscrapers because they weren’t a novelty, although Times Square is a must-see, at least once
Would happily go back as a tourist
The popular series "Friends" is translated as Φιλαράκια or "The buddies" in Greek instead of just "friends".
Star Trek: Discovery is called "Σταρ Τρεκ: Ντισκάβερι" in Greek, which is not a translation of the English title into Greek
If you read the Greek title, it's sounds the same with the English title without making sense in Greek
Another one I found about is "The Haunting of Bly Manor"
"Οι δαίμωνες της Επαυλης Μπλάι" or "The demons of Bly Manor".
Alvin and the Chipmunks is translated as "Alvin and his company" (meaning the other squirrels), "Ο Άλβιν και η παρέα του".
Mission Impossible - > "Επικίνδυνη Αποστόλη" "Dangerous Mission"
Die Hard - > "Πολύ σκληρός για να πεθάνει", "Too tough to die"
Get out - > "Τρέξε", meaning "run"
Manchester by the sea is translated to "One city near the sea", I guess we hate Manchester or smth
People broke into my house 3 times
The problem with having border line no police whatsoever outside of Athens
Athens has the most crime by far, that is why they have like 85% of the police
So bad luck I guess then, as Athens is not under control
Pepi Tsesmeli, Liliana Hioti, Efi Thodi, Anastasia Gioussef, Vera Lambrou etc
That one was unironically my top song on Spotify for 3 months straight earlier this year

I don't think you need a car to get around Athens
Actually, it's a nightmare taking a car down town and you will probably and up stuck in traffic and you'll park two miles away from where you need to go
Public transport might be pain on the bottom but still better than driving
Athens/Piraeus here, absolutely no necessity
Generally no, and I don't live at the centre of Athens
Metro is ok for me, it helps me avoid the traffic
Metro is generally much better than taking the car when there's traffic
Buses are terrible though, you can't depend on them to be on time
>What are some of your ~~weird~~ laws that are still technically in effect but nobody's gonna bother enforcing them
p much all of them
High Heels and other shoes that pose a danger to historical sites are illegal
If you're going to visit the Parthenon, make sure to not wear high heels
as for "nobody's gonna bother enforcing them". thats our whole legal system
I may or may not be kind of biased here, but if you count Greece as a Balkan country, then probably Athens because of the importance in history I guess
If you mean today, I would not know how to rank or check for "importance".
No Athens = No democracy and Nice architecture
I'll leave this here
If we count as balkan countries, I also agree that both are important, considering the common history, and the huge parts of it which were the byzantine and ottoman times
Though greece is maybe a touch more rich in history if you go further back I guess
But I also am not sure what op means by important, like if they mean by political importance rn or the historical aspect
I live a 100 metres from Plato's academy in Athens, all the buildings in the area took forever to be built because they had to bring in archaeologists to assess if the artefacts that are found should be buried again or relocated, but it's not like this everywhere in Athens
In Greece too
We’ve been struggling to build a metro line of a few kilometres in Thessaloniki because of this situation
Are you high on drugs mate
Seriously
I don’t think it serves any kind of purpose to have expansionist or revisionist views about sovereignty
It promotes nationalism and racism
Of course many Greeks think that getting back Constantinople would be the most important thing but I don’t think that sacrificing our current borders or sovereignty would be really smart
In the Greco-Turkish war we had initially won back some of our lands and had expanded our state but we wanted too much and went in too far, spread our forces around and actually lost even what we had won
We have a saying in our language: whoever wants the many, loses the few
EDIT: Also wanted to say that’s why I find that Bulgarian guy’s post a little bit racist
Thessaloniki was Greek hundreds of years before it was captured by Bulgaria
Actually there is a big amount of people not paying at all, due to the service being extremely bad, but anyway you can buy paper tickets from small convenience stores, the transport company's ticket offices (at the main bus terminals) or buy a ticket (not all variants available) from an automatic machine inside the bus (doesn't give change) or from the driver - depending on the line (OASTH, Thessaloniki Greece)
Or of course you can buy a monthly pass 10 days before or after the 1st of a month
Even though, after a lot of years, we can finally pay with our CC, we can only buy them in train stations, or designated bus stations
You can't just ride a bus and buy a ticket inside
Less limiting for us, too limiting for tourists; I've helped some navigate the city when I was studying downtown
It's τυρί (tyrí) as well in Greek which means cheese, but I think it more makes you smile for been a totally random thing to say when taking a photograph, rather than making you show teeth by the way it's pronounced

Do you have internet in Greece

In Greece the major clubs are multi-sport clubs so there can be incidents in any sport
In Greece fans get violent over Basketball, Volleyball, Handball and Waterpolo too
Ultras in Greece turn violent regardless of sport or class
My team had a U-15 basketball game against Olympiacos cancelled because things got chippy and the officiating was questionable, so a bunch of ultras came out of nowhere, threw flares and some of them stormed the court and started beating the referee and chasing the players
We needed police escort to leave the locker room
Basketball, polo, volleyball
We could even get violent over tennis, if we were interested enough for it
It's quite popular but it is not anywhere close to football in popularity
Drinking our ass out, and then wondering why our head is dizzy and our wallet empty
We'd also be insisting that we should order more food when clearly everybody has already eaten way too much

Ehm, excuse me sir
These are fighting words
You need someone who knows how to cook meat properly /s
I mean, if **we** are not cooking i'd want Italy to cook
Nah
Although (as a history lover) I was aware of it, the fact that we had a brutal civil war in the late 40s was never even mentioned at our school
Possibly because it has probably never ended
People still get very defensive/emotional/mad when you state something about it and feelings run high even when you talk facts
I didn't know my region was a part of the Republic of Venice, then a part of the French Republic, then an autonomous Republic under nominal Ottoman suzerainty and Russian protection (essentially a Russian protectorate), then a part of the First French Empire and after that a British amical protectorate called the "United States of the Ionian Islands".
My region is not really mentioned in our textbooks so before reading about it on the internet, I only knew that we had a some sort of closer relationship with Italy, which is kind of vague and inaccurate
Once I started reading, I started appreciating my hometown a lot more because it made me pay more attention to certain things that I used to just overlook
My region is not the only one with an interesting past though
There's other places like Crete, Rhodes, Thessaloniki and the Peloponnese, which I find fascinating, but we don't learn a lot about their past either
I guess I just wish we would learn more about what happened after the collapse of the Eastern Roman Empire
I'm not saying we should know every little detail, but it would be nice to have a general idea of what was going in different parts of Greece during that time
You're right
But at that time period they were changing hands all the time and they weren't under the same kingdom/empire if I remember correctly
The Ionian Islands became a separate "block" (can't think of a better word to describe it) only after they came under the control of Venice
But anyway, yeah, most of them were part of the Kingdom of Sicily for some time
I didn't mention it because the timeline would become much more complicated and because Sicily didn't have much of an impact on the islands as far as I know
i would love a greek skam remake, since it has been done in many other european countries and i think greece needs a tv show that deals with bullying, sexual assault, coming to terms with homosexuality, mental illness and racism
but it’s greece and we’d probably fuck it up so maybe it’s for the best
Oh I'd absolutely love this
Skam (when done well) just offers itself for some great commentary on the society it concerns, while bringing to light some very interesting issues teenagers face . Considering how diverse life in each European country can be, I think that it would be great to have more "Skams" that retain the main ideas while deviating from the clear cut plot progression of the original show
Great movie, but has many inaccuracies/lies, as reported by many of the people featured in the book
yeah it is kind of similar especially with the seasons that are centered around different characters like skins did with different episodes
but i think skins was a lot more dark
An hour has passed
It's ongoing actually
A sailing Olympic athlete, Sophia Bekatorou, came public about being sexually abused by an official of the Hellenic Sailing Federation in 1998
This caused a domino effect with new cases seeing the light of day almost daily from sports, tv, theatre etc, both sexes too

Yeah, we’re having a #MeToo moment right now
not a pop aficionado but I devour music, so
when I was a teen I was into garage punk and I couldn't care less about lyrics, just the one chords and the screams were enough to get me going
as I was honing my english skills I noticed that 90% of the lyrics is about girls who betray guys and stuff like that
I instantly became indifferent, I could not hear another song about the girl that left me and that I'm all that you need and whatev
but at the same time I learned to appreciate the lyrics of psychedelic music
also as a kid I was listening to "vamos a la playa" and I was thinking what a happy song but then I realised it was about a nuclear bomb exploding and everything becoming radioactive
Barbie girl has never been the same
I don't pay much attention to lyrics, the song has to be really offensive to stop listening to it
I could finally sing along and not make incoherent noises ! Though I was 14 when I got my certificate
I don't know nowadays but back in the 90's it was still a thing
And it was not as pc as it would be now, plus the ages would be realistically from preteens to teens which gave you a new perspective on everything, true eye opener
I went to a mountain summer camp, bonfires and all but I knew of very well developed summer camps next to beaches
They still exist but my kids are too young atm to send them there so I don't know how popular they are now
Yes
Althought i've never been to one, most of my friends had fantastic experiences
Apart from private owned summer camps,there are also public camps
They exist and have always been fairly popular
They still exist and are very popular too
Usually beach camps /sports camps
Kids stay there for 11, 15 or 22 days or more depending on what they want, but those are the standard packages
Food is provided, they sleep in little bungalows and they do fun activities all day
I haven't been on reddit for long, but I visit this subreddit daily
It's really interesting
I always go for go for the New posts first instead of the Top ones
Believe it or not capital punishment for all crimes in Greece,was officially abolished in 2004
But it had gradually stopped to be in effect since 1972,where the last person executed had burned his ex wife and two children alive
Since 1975, death penalty was still given to prisoners for high treason,but in reality it meant life in prison
In 2013, the nightmare nazi political party Golden Dawn,tried to suggest that we should re-establish it,but of course nothing was even discussed in parliament
From what I know,there weren't any protests or any other forms of public unrest in order to abolish the death penalty
I am sure that there where voices that were against it but nothing extreme
Its just stopped to be used
Pretty sure re establishing the death penalty is one of Greek solution's commandments as well lol
no unfortunately we have a lot of closed minded people, truth be said it is from bad experiences from some of them but generalising and dehumanizing all of them needs to stop
I'd say it mostly has to do with your education/status/family orientation
An educated (or at least someone with any interest in education, say a student), family oriented person will likely integrate just fine here
People that consistently refuse to integrate in Greek life is what we don't like
Carry your cultural background with pride with you but don't spit on the ground you're living in, be open, be honest, make friends
If you have or wish to have a good education, or/and you want to work and you have a family to take care of, shows you're a grounded individual with hopes and fears like everyone else
I've had all kinds of friends, some were foreigners
Some fit well here (many Albanian kids do), others don't. I had a friend once that was half black, and another friend (we were all close from elementary to high school) one day started a rant about specifically black guys selling cd's (it was the 90s, I'm old), we rolled our eyes and started looking at him "dude
", he turned around and apologised to her "I swear I *forgot* you're even black
I'm so sorry I wasn't thinking".
It is a day off cause it was Easter yesterday(Easter here is as big as Christmas)
Tomorrow will be a day off cause of May 1st
Also, a bit jokingly, I believe anyone who can, will take the rest of the week off cause bars and restaurants open today after a 6 month lockdown
In Greece the 1st of May got transferred to tomorrow (Tuesday, 4th of May) because the orthodox Easter was yesterday and today is the 2nd day, so they changed it to a day that is not "holy" (does that make sense
Normally, I think it doesn't matter whether or not the 1st of May falls on a weekend day here in Greece
Well in orthodox countries it is the second day of Easter so in a lot of countries its a holiday and the workers holiday gets postponed another day on 5he tuesday
Yes, Greece is an orthodox country
The only real easter :p
Yes, both Greek state and Greek church follow the Gregorian calendar, except for Easter (and of course all the other religious dates that are related to Easter) which follows the Julian calendar
Once Everyday
I have long hair, I work out, if I don't shower afterwards I will be captain stench and my hair will look like a mirror with all the grease reflecting the light
Besides that, by Greek standards if you don't bathe daily you will seem like a weirdo, there are people who even wash themselves twice a day
Hygiene is very important here
i shower daily and i take an actual bath maybe once every couple of months
Same here, although in the summer I usually shower more than once depending on if I get out of the house/air-conditioning during the daytime
I also found it was critically important during my army service, we used to shower like 3-4 times a day
Constantine the Great  did lots of stuff for my country and religion
Everyone living in Athens is allowed to look down to every other city since we're living un the biggest, history richest city, in which we have a metro unlike other cities - **Looking at you, Thessaloniki** - and can brag about it
We also have the proper name for Souvlaki
Fyi:
Thessaloniki is the biggest "rival" of Athens and 2nd biggest city of the country
Athens(664,046) > Thessaloniki(354,290) > Patras(168,034)
In the 1900s the most of the Greek population moved to Athens and Thessaloniki but in recent years they've started going back smaller towns and cities, the population of Athens and Thessaloniki has been dropping in recent years while the population of Patras and Heraklion along with other cities has been rising
>Athens(664,046)
That's just the municipality
What Greeks would consider to be "Athens" is closer to 3 million people and dominates the political, social, cultural and economic life of the country
Yeah I know but the same goes for the other cities I mentioned I think
Does that falsify what I said above
I I'm not sure that's why I'm asking
No your description is true but I think the population figures are misleading
No one would say Athens is only 664,00 people or that Thessaloniki is 354,000
It would be moree accurate to say Athens (3 million), Thessaloniki (800,000) and Patras (210,000)
Yeah but by Googling only the numbers above came up, so u figured instead of looking into it more, these numbers give my point across either way

There are a lot of solid metal bands in Greece, but since you emphasized on wanting distinctive elements about the country there is only one choice
VIC are a really unique band because they combine metal sound with greek folk instruments
The lyrics are also mostly inspired by folk music
Most of their songs are in greek, so i would suggest that you listen to those ones first and then move on to the english ones, because you'll get a more accurate idea of their style
Their live performances are also really good
I see the others suggested you VIC for Greece
I think it fits very nicely to your criteria, they are awesome
To spoil you for choice, here is an equally awesome one: [Κραυγή - Ψαραντώνης/Μάριος Λουπάσης] [Psarantonis] is a chapter on his own, his voice is timeless, like the primordial mountains
He plays the cretan cousin of *kemençe*, which might be interesting for you
Also in case you are eventually missing any countries, there are some [incredible lists] over at r/IndigenousMetal that might help you
I would love to see your playlist when its ready
Came here to say this, this band is gold ;)

Damn that sucks dude
I haven't really researched the matter but the gust of it is
Members of the fascist party Golden Dawn murdered someone a few years ago and during 2020 they finally found the people who did it and also found that they were instructed by the leader of the Fascist party
They party was deemed a terrorist organization and it's members were put in jail, after this incident the prisoners of Korydalos raised a menacing banner saying ["welcome kids"] basically being the Greek version of "well well well who do we have here"
the (court-martial) Court of the six
(note: although it was named court of the six 8 people were on the court but only six got executed) the six were people who thought to be responsible for the Asian minor disaster
I remember hearing in the news that they were deemed a terrorist organization but that's just a matter of definition I guess
As I said I didn't do any research and just said what I remember thanks for clearing that up also I didn't know the photo was photoshopped thanks for that too(also the link doesn't work for me)
Yup
Greeks can check and tell me if I need to change anything
Σε ευχαριστώ (I thank you)
Σας ευχαριστώ (I thank You, pl)
Σας ευχαριστούμε (We thank you/You)
yes, and it also changes depending on wether you are thanking one or more people
Ευχαριστώ = [I] thank you
Ευχαριστούμε = [We] thank you
Of course
It's not the same word for both singular and plural
In the grades equivalent to 7th, 8th and 9th Grade (1st second and third of Gymnasion), in Ancient Greek literature we are taught the works of Homer (Odyssey, Iliad) and the tragic poet Euripides (Helen)
There is also modern Greek literature in which we learn different stories, poems and fairytales of modern and early modern Greek authors about society, war, family, history but also folk literature
When I was I School we had two types of mandatory literature, which I think they still have
We read the Classics, like Homer, Sophocles, Euripides both in Ancient and Modern Greek
Then we had modern Greeks with a mixture of poetry and stories like Sepheris, Elytis, Papadiamantis etc
For both classes, we wrote essays etc
In Greece we've read: [Odyssey] [Iliad] [Helen]
In Switzerland we've read:
[Götz von Berlichingen] Jugend ohne Gott
and other ones that I can't remember
Well it really depends on the text and the age of it but Homeric texts are definitely too old to understand the full text so that’s why we do them in modern Greek though keeping many ancient words
Keep in mind though we learn Ancient Greek as a separate lesson from modern Greek in Gymnasion and read some smaller literary texts in full Classical Ancient Greek
The vast majority don't really know it other than phrases and some words
For the most part it's just a school subject everyone hates lol
Pretty common, I'd go so far as to say a respectable percentage of Greek males will go through a long hair phase at some point
On a completely urelated note, Greece has the highest number of metal bands per capita outside scandinavia
98% of the time it's only metal heads that have long hair and they aren't too rare
also men that are 40+ years old that just put them in a ponytail
Uncommon, if you're clean shaven and young, you will probably get called Miss a few times by older folk :D.
Other than that, it's not 'bad' to have long hair, most people don't care at all but older generations MIGHT think you're a degenerate or something
I mean, as most point out, I think it's quite usual among metalheads, and I've seen some non-metalheads maintaining a man bun as well, but overall, I don't think it's that common
Έχω 10 στενούς φίλους, κυριολεκτικά κανένας δεν έχει μακριά μαλλιά εκτός από μένα. Δε ξέρω που τους βλέπεις όλους αυτούς. 10% ΜΑΞ σου λέω εγώ έχει μακριά μαλλιά.
Literally translated: Horse of the Mother of Jesus*
*Mother of Jesus is a single word in Greek
[Zorbas Dance] think that's what it's called)
Also ["Το Ζεϊμπέκικο της Ευδοκίας"]
I had no idea that Daft punk is from France wow
Also "despacito"
Well my bad
I came to Sweden 2 months ago, and I told my group of friends in English (I'm in Erasmus right now)
I come back from Sweden and everyone is asking how Switzerland was like
we help them to grow their fortunes and their descendants to control much of social and financial life in the the country
This is a very interesting case in Greece, because there never really were any mass trials for Nazi collaborators
During Axis occupied Greece, many Greek communists fought against the Nazis and right wing Greeks too, which led to some right wing Greek groups (especially in the southern Peloponnese and cities like Thessaloniki) siding with the Nazis, and even rebel groups that fought for them, as well as official groups (like the security Battalions, who were Greek evzone unites directly controlled by the Third Reich, basically the Greek SS)
After the Nazis left, the communists were a great threat to the Greek Monarchist state, so there was a brutal civil war between fascists/Monarchists and Republicans against mostly communists and other leftists
It was not in the in interest of the Greek state to get rid of Nazi collaborators, since they were helping them fight the communists
This led to unpunished Greek Nazi collaboration, and many Greek Nazi sympathizers
"Punished" is a joke here
Some Nazi collaborators may have been slain by the resistance factions during ww2 but as Greece shifted immediately to the civil war - the first of cold war proxy wars- those nazi collaborators were assimilated by the right wing resistance army (heavily supported by Britain) in the war against the communist resistance army (mildy supported by communist balkan states)
So nazi collaborators became backbones of the greek right-wing state for decades
Even today you get some fascist or closeted fascist  politicians whose fathers happened to be the traitors who were prominent supporters of the military junta (1967-1974) and their grandfathers happened to be the traitors who collaborated with the nazis
"In France or Italy, if you fought the Nazis, you were respected in society after the war, regardless of ideology
In Greece, you found yourself fighting – or imprisoned and tortured by – the people who had collaborated with the Nazis, on British orders
>The head of MI5 reported in 1940 that “in the personality and  experience of Sir Charles Wickham, the fighting services have at their  elbow a most valuable friend and counsellor”. When the intelligence  services needed to integrate the Greek Security Battalions – the Third  Reich’s “Special Constabulary” – into a new police force, they had found  their man
>Greek academics vary in their views on how directly  responsible Wickham was in establishing the camps and staffing them with  the torturers
Panourgia finds the camp on Giaros – an island which  even the Roman Emperor Tiberius decreed unfit for prisoners – to have  been Wickham’s own direct initiative
Gerolymatos, meanwhile, says: “The  Greeks didn’t need the British to help them set up camps
It had been  done before, under Metaxas
” Papers at Kew show British police serving  under Wickham to be regularly present in the camps
>Gerolymatos  adds: “The British – and that means Wickham – knew who these people  were
And that’s what makes it so frightening
They were the people who  had been in the torture chambers during occupation, pulling out the  fingernails and applying thumbscrews
” By September 1947, the year the  Communist Party was outlawed, 19,620 leftists were held in Greek camps  and prisons, 12,000 of them in Makronissos, with a further 39,948 exiled  internally or in British camps across the Middle East
There exist many  terrifying accounts of torture, murder and sadism in the Greek  concentration camps – one of the outrageous atrocities in postwar  Europe
Polymeris Volgis of New York University describes how a system  of repentance was introduced as though by a “latter-day secular  Inquisition”, with confessions extracted through “endless and violent  degradation”.
>Women detainees would have their children taken away  until they confessed to being “Bulgarians” and “whores”. The repentance  system led Makronissos to be seen as a “school” and “National  University” for those now convinced that “Our life belongs to Mother  Greece,’ in which converts were visited by the king and queen, ministers  and foreign officials
“The idea”, says Patríkios, who never repented,  “was to reform and create patriots who would serve the homeland
>Minors  in the Kifissa prison were beaten with wires and socks filled with  concrete
“On the boys’ chests, they sewed name tags”, writes Voglis,  “with Slavic endings added to the names; many boys were raped”. A female  prisoner was forced, after a severe beating, to stand in the square of  Kastoria holding the severed heads of her uncle and brother-in-law
One  detainee at Patras prison in May 1945 writes simply this: “They beat me  furiously on the soles of my feet until I lost my sight
I lost the  world
>Nowhere else in newly liberated Europe were Nazi sympathisers enabled  to penetrate the state structure – the army, security forces, judiciary  – so effectively
The resurgence of neo-fascism in the form of  present-day far-right party [Golden Dawn]  has direct links to the failure to purge the state of right-wing  extremists; many of Golden Dawn’s supporters are descendants of  Battalionists, as were the “The Colonels” who seized power in 1967
>“The whole thing”, spits Dr Gerolymatos, “was for nothing
None of  this need have happened, and the British crime was to legitimise people  whose record under occupation by the Third Reich put them beyond  legitimacy
It happened because Churchill believed he had to bring back  the Greek king
And the last thing the Greek people wanted or needed was  the return of a de-frocked monarchy backed by Nazi collaborators
But  that is what the British imposed, and it has scarred Greece ever since
>“All  those collaborators went into the system,” says Manilos Glezos
“Into  the government mechanism – during and after the civil war, and their  sons went into the military junta
The deposits remain, like malignant  cells in the system
Although we liberated Greece, the Nazi  collaborators won the war, thanks to the British
And the deposits  remain, like bacilli in the system
> We did give money to Greece
...to fund the civil war
None cause there aren't any near me but I really want to
I have visited quite a few ancient temples though
And a small underwater prehistoric village thing
Not many castles really, I have visited one in Heidelberg though
Since I'm Greek I've obviously visited loads of ancient temples and ruins, and some in Italy too
Like 2, one in Germany and one in the UK
Greece doesn't really have castles more like giant walled cities, if that counts then like 10
3 or 4 maybe
Does Kastra in Thessaloniki count
I don't think it would since it's just ruins and walls, but if it does then one
Well by Greek standards it probably is
The one I want to visit the most is Spinalonga but I haven't been to Crete in years
Sometimes they pay me my salary
Employment Benef
What
Pft, check this guy out with his salary
You mad bro
Bro, I can't even afford to be mad
^^^sobs
The shortest I could think of is [έπαινοι] lit
praise, credit, award (_in education_)
Now I have to find another one xD
That only has 3 vowels ε, οι and α.
our language is kind of a cheat though, cause that basically has 2 "e" and 1 "i"
Edit: "ενδυναμώνουν" (endinamonun) for example has all e,i,a,o,u sounds, just many consonants in between (...for Greek standards)
That's true lol
Unusual answer but the Persian wars (500BC) was the first time the Hellenic people fought together against a common threat
Oof, this is hard, but I would not go with the obvious War of Independence in 1821 and rather choose the 1922 "Asia Minor Disaster" which concluded the Greco-Turkish war
Pontus, Cappadocia, Smyrna and of course Constantinople (now Istanbul) were places where Greeks had been living in for millenia and they were suddenly uprooted violently after the army lost the zone of Smyrna
So on the one hand you have the erasing of thousands of years of greek history in Anatolia
On the other hand, the arriving refugees were proud and hard-working people that not only strengthened our position in Macedonia, but helped create a somewhat better economic environment
Overall this compacted the nation into the new borders
Definitely a really defining period
Our war of independence, probably, but I think many people feel more connected to ww2 because it's more recent
I'd actually agree with you on that
The arrival of the refugees really shook the foundations of modern Greece, causing it to change irrevocably to what it is today
Arts were completely redefined (music, poetry, literature, theater) with many of the sounds we still hear today stem from the creations of the refugees
I don't think I need to mention people like Seferis, Venezis, Dido Sotiriou, Kastoriades etc
The economy was massively affected as well, with so many new people coming in, women entering the workforce, the distribution of land and the revitalization of more remote areas, the introduction of new and improved farming methods etc
Plus many welfare projects were put into place for the first time then, while there was also an increase in infrastructure related projects, again, to accommodate this massive influx of refugees
Politics were also impacted, as you had this new group of people to cater to now, and a group of people that included many highly educated folks at that
There's so much more to say about the Refugee Crisis of 1923 and onward, and I think that Greece would not be the same country it is today without these people
I myself wouldn't exist so
From whom (genuinely asking, Turkey has never been occupied by foreign forces, to my knowledge)
Unless you're referring to the campaigns after ww1
Olives, they fucking stink
Also, really any type of fish except for tuna
Going to seafood-based taverns in the summer really sucks
My uncle once tried a sugar-potato (krumplicukor) which is essentially potato with sugar
It was 10 years ago and he still claims it to be the most disgusting thing he has ever had
>there is a tendency to stereotype every European cuisine other than France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal as horrendous and bland
That's dumb as fuck
My ex is from Denmark and lemme tell ya you guys have some really tasty looking dishes up there that I'd love to try once I visit
You hurt me deeply, just so you know
I dont like olives either
Neither do I like eggplant so there goes mousakas
I enjoy fish though
Wait till I tell you that I can't fucking stand the smell of feta either
I only eat it with pasta
Enough of a reason for all Italians and Greeks to publicly execute me
Let's find out
Yep
Can't stand any kind of olives
Yeah ntolmádes are greek (ntolmás is the singular form)
I'm not really a fan of those either
Oh there's another one
I don't like mousakas at all, because of the eggplant
If it was only the other ingredients then it would be divinely tasty, but nah
I love that combination as well, but no olives please
Just olive oil
High five my dude
How do people eat this shit
Please turn yourself in at the nearest police station for deportation
The greek one, didn't know there was a danish feta
What's that like
Don't worry I'll willingly leave once I'm financially stable enough for that
Spoken like a true Greek
That's definitely interesting as fuck
I've noticed that we got the same cuisine in all of the Balkan countries while calling the dishes different names
Dry feta is the only variant I can stand
That sounds like something I wouldn't be a fan of either
Yep
Is it
Is it
Haven't heard of it
Probably the Acropolis museum and the Goulandris museum, the National Archaeological museum as well, and I guess Lalaounis jewellery museum and Vorres laographical museum
At least for Athens, and its probably not a complete list
For other cities, someone else might know better
There are 9 KFC stores all over Greece, 8 of them in Athens
To put things into perspective there are only 21 McDonald's stores as well
Foreign fast food chains aren't popular at all here
Locals prefer either Greek chains or the neighbourhood fast food joint
The same applies with every brand, like Domino's and Pizza Hut
Burger King doesn't have a single store even
Neither KFC nor McDonalds are very popular in Greece and this is probably because of gyros
There's like 5 of them in Athens and i think that's it
Pretty much
Unless you are literally giving away food the fast food and delivery market is pretty saturated with local product in Greece, and that's just fine really
TGIF and Ruby Tuesday's chains also came and went at some point
Asking the real questions here
Compared to other places they aren't
What you said about the economy is probably true and further proves my point
Also I may be a bit but biased since I dont live in a huge city (Larisa) and McDonalds only opened last year, it wasn't that big of a deal tbh
I'd say yes, it'd be extremely weird if someone in his late 20s-30s couldn't cook anything
Cooking meat-pasta-rice-salads etc is super easy, healthy, and cheap compared with takeaway
I think younger generations can actually cook better than their parents
Firstly because they're more open-minded regarding different recipes/cuisines and secondly because of the range of information available online
It has never been easier to access culinary knowledge and tips
Italy, for sure
Una faccia una razza
Italy, Spain and Serbia
Lot's of love from Greece
We love you too bros(as long as you are in our side in ww3)
Quite different
Athens is a lot more hectic and busy (My family is from a Greek island)
I feel like time is a lot more abstract in the islands too, which can be good and bad
just look at the delayed ferries haha
According to the people I know who lived in both Athens and smaller cities or islands:
- Everything takes too much time to be done
A chore that may take 10mins somewhere else may take 2h in Athens cause of commute etc
(Keep in mind that Athens is dense af, 3 of its 4 sectors are among the 7 most densely populated european regions)
- Being the capital, it has a big variety of things to do, mostly when it comes to shopping or events/concerts
I'm pretty sure other big cities have a fair share of that though
- Athens does have some nice parts with natural beauty and nice architecture, but its concrete jungle part can be overwhelming
I don't know if there are other places so heavy on that part
- Athens lifestyle is more tense and it's more usual to come across tense people
From my experience, people in the islands are much more open-hearted than Athenians (of course that's a generalisation)
Not sure about Christmas but I'm pretty sure we have a new year's lottery
Btw, according to the custom, anything Santa related (for Greek orthodox christianity that's Saint Basil of Caesarea), is also moved up to New Year's Eve instead of Christmas' Eve
Spain : being treated tequillas by guys me and my friend had met 10 minutes ago
The whole party/tapas/pinchos culture
UK : argument with drunk Welsh girl if being Welsh is being British (it is, British includes English, Scottich and Welsh)
After agreeing to disagreeing we went to a pub with friends of mine and hers
France : I was 13 years old, school trip
Our professor misheard "treize" for "trois" and we walked 13 bridges of the Seine instead of 3 to get to our boat
We nearly missed it and whoever student could speak French (the professor did not !) was shouting "Arrete Capitan" to the captain
Italy : having wrong tickets for the train, and inspector smilng saying it is OK you did not know, just be careful
Small incident that makes you like a people (in contrast with Germany
Germany : I struggle to find
Probably when I tried to intervene when an inspector was bullying an 18 year old boy for having forgotten his train card and I managed to annoy him enough and waste his time to give him a pass
I winced at the kid and signaled him to get out in the 1st stop immediately before inspector changes his mind
Small incident that made me very happy to "beat" the hostile toe-the-line German system xDD
Switzerland : getting nice photos in Lake Luzern
Turkey :  merchants in Izimir speaking more Greek than English and trying to sell us whatever in completely random prices
We still do but if I mention him, I will have to wear cement shoes and go swimming totally voluntarily
Heya what did he do
If anyone needs more info, google about the Noor-1 case
You will be missed
I am not afr
Marinakis wants to know your location
Whom is this name you speak of
Never even heard of it, NEVER
I TELL YOU
Crete probably, it's the most self reliant of the regions all things considered, and have a pretty distinct character
Not to mention, they were briefly an independent country
Though being the "most likely" doesn't mean they actually want to
They are some of the most patriotic Greeks I've ever seen
Otherwise I would probably say Thrace purely because it has a sizable Muslim minority, but independence doesn't seem that popular for them either
we dont like to call them stray (even tho most of the time they are)
we like to call them "neighborhood pets"
Mostly cats
A few areas will have a few stray dogs but there are stray cats everywhere unfortunately
Quite a big one
Many of them, however, are not 100% stray
They just live on the street but the community takes care of their food and sometimes health
Not ideal by any means but it has to be pointed out
We have allot in greece but we don't consider it a problem
(for dogs)
Cats on the other hand are deliberately used as pest control
(It was also done in Russia I think, and the commemorated them with a huge cat statue
) Many tourists think it's because of pour government/economic crisis, which is frustrating as it is, when the truth is that we just don't like rats
Yes, and people think it's cute and stuff
It is fucking not, where do you think all these cats shit and piss
In my neighborhood we have a woman that feeds cats all around the neighborhood so many cats have gathered and since our apartment building is from the few in the neighborhood with dirt and grass patches it means many of the stray cats come to shit and piss in our block
They are fucking pests, if she loves them so much then she can take them in her house, I don't like going out of my house and smelling cat shit nor do I like toxoplasmosis
We used to have a gang of abandoned dogs as well but they gathered them up, but they do not do shit about the cats
Most of the time the strays are cats which you can’t tell if they are someone’s pet or not
As for dogs if they have a collar you know it’s someone’s, but if they don’t have a collar it’s usually that they are just stray
As anecdotal evidence, I don’t know anyone that has encountered aggressive stray dogs of any kind, they are friendly and want to be petted so they come up to you some times
They aren’t scared of people
A lot of people, even if they have no pets, leave out cat/dog food in a bowl and also water in another bowl
My old apartment used to leave water and pet food for any neighborhood pet, it’s a common thing
So yeah, they are actually neighborhood pets
No they are actually neighbourhood pets with everyone feeding the scraps and petting them
It is only a problem in semi-rural/urban areas where people go to abandon their pets and whole beards form that the locals can't take off
Those are the only instances you can find unattended, maybe hostile strays
Same in Greece, mostly used is blue then it's black
Of course the BIC pens were very common and Pilot I remember too
Parents being present at a kids' party is quite common in Greece for really young individuals (~ <10yo), or at least that was the case for me anyway
The parents mostly sit somewhere farther away and seldom interfere unless there's some sort of trouble, often chit chatting about irrerevant things
They also discuss school matters as most kids present also happen to be classmates from primary school
It's not uncommon for parents to just drop off their kids and pick them later, but since they all often become sort of friends due to their kids they usually enjoy the company
After growing up somewhat (say joining junior high), said kids start feeling quite uneasy at the mere thought of having their parents around them and their peers, therefore they promise they'll behave so that their parents can trust them enough to let them enjoy their party by themselves
It could go both ways in Greece
You can drop the kids of to a party and pick them up later but also a lot of parents might stay and socialize with the other parents
I don't think there is a rule
It depends on how well you know the other parents, if they ask to stay, wether you're busy etc
But I dont think its considered weird
no but we do some presentations as kids about diffrent customs and traditions around the country, for example when it's christmas we will each do a presentation about the diffrences in Christmas where we're from, at least that's what we do here in Attica where most of the population is
Yeah, that’s a real word, suuuuure
Golden dawn, a Greek far right party, didnt get enough votes to get in the parliament (thank god)
The absurd law that banned the police from entering university premises is getting abolished
Protected by this law, drug dealers, illegal immigrants and sorts of criminals were finding refugee inside, as well as anarchists retreating there after fights with police
Political youths in Athens' unis paint the buildings with slogans and litter it with posters, beat each other very often, and police can do nothing for all this
It is about to change
... or, if one looks at it from a non-government, non-right-wing supporter angle, the law that offers a basic level of protection to the most politically energetic part of the population (students) is getting abolished in an effort of the most right-wing, authoritarian government post-1975, to make it easier for itself to crack down on them
After all, this government is looking forward to a bright 4-year austerity future of making the rich richer at the expense of the poor, and don't want that getting terminated early by any violent societal pushback, spearheaded by the students
I like all three but I am not multilingual so probably not Switzerland, and Germany has a very foreign culture to us, at least compared to the other two, so probably Austria
If it was Germany, I would choose Bavaria either way
I also have a thing for Austria
It's a very interesting country
But as I said I really like them all
i'm not quite sure about across the country but the train inside of Attica (in and around Athens) is 1,40 €
and by a quick google it seems that the Athens-Thessaloniki train costs 20 €
(keep in mind that railroads within the country aren't as developed as the rest of europe because of our mountainous geography)
I have no idea cause I generally don't travel by train, but I only know that to get from where I live (Thessaloniki) to my hometown (Edessa), which is 100km away, the train ticket is 7€
Wow that's cheap
Pretty sure everything is based in Athens
Sophocles Antigone **in ancient Greek**, it was a nightmare for me since I was science orientated, although other classmates had not much problem with it
Ancient Greek is a mandatory school subject for two years in Greek Lyzeum (which is the equivilant to the German Gymnasium), so no, there's no way avoiding it
>tragedies are the hardest texts to translate
Tragedies are really tragedies ;p
You're right about that, cause the other book was Euripides Iphigenia in Tauris and it was actually much easier
Wait, it's been absolute ages since I graduated but I'm pretty sure I had ancient Greek for the whole 6 years of middle/high school, and I was in the Technology direction/specialisation
Is it only two years now
Iphigenia in Tauris
Why do I remember another one
Two years in Lyzeum back in the 90's, and I mean strictly ancient Greek, not the translated or semi-translated stuff we had in Gymnasium
Well, like I've said it wasn't my subject of choise and It has also been a long while since then, but I'm pretty sure we had this one in ancient Greek, or at least a big part of it
Ah right, thanks
we invented languages so whatever words you use is ours
The muslim immigrants promoted it so strongly
As they did with other words
Come to Greece and you'll get your money's worth of insane driving
I don't give a rat's ass about investments so my disposable income goes to things I want the most but my cousin and his wife,  each one making around a thousand euros per month, have already flipped two small apartments, listed another one in airbnb and bought a house for them just recently
so if you want, you can do stuff
Yes and No
It depends on a variety of factors
I, with a military income and my girlfriend who also military and gets paid the same we have enough to live with some minimum comfort like having more than one vehicles
Now most greeks have side businesses like  olive oil selling from middle october to middle December
The increased number of new cars on the roads after 2018, when the economic crisis ended prove that there is money in Greece
For the last 9 years my -now- husband and I speak in English even though I speak Greek to our kids and he speaks both to them too
Both him and I forget words in our languages, sometimes we substitute them with words from the other languages but yes it's so embarrassing
I also now catch myself speaking Greek to someome and then almost speaking English only to correct myself embarrassed
I always had people thinking I'm not Greek (redhead, fair skin) but because of that they now really think I'm a foreigner
All the bloody time,the funny thing is that i may remember the word in English but not in Greek
You forgot that cat in Cypriot Greek is cata (if I recall correctly)
Damn sounds like something that'd happen to me
Yes, same reason too
definitely sounds the best to me, and if I had to choose a Nordic language based on grammar or vocabulary, I'd still choose Danish
Not when it comes to numbers though
Swedes don't attack me pls
Edit: I was also surprised by how the phonology of Finnish is almost identical to that of Greek

The situation is quite similar in Greece too

[This bullshit]
The simplifications that the greek language is undergoing
For example the word "mixture" in greek is μείγμα (meigma) but you can also write it down as μίγμα (migma)
And the thing that annoys me the most is the word καινούργιο (kainourgio) which can be written as καινούριο (kainourio)
The word καινούργιο means new in English and etymologically it is derived from words καινό and έργο (kaino ergo) which literally translates to recent act
Without the letter γ (gamma) it seems wrong to write it down if you look at the etymology
It could either go really great -Italy
Or really horrible - Turkey
(Or i guess Albania or Bulgaria) which is kinda already happening
Greece-Bulgaria-NMK-Albania-Turkey
I think this reminds of something from the past
We've got it pretty bad, our best scenario I guess would be Bulgaria, but you know
I guess you could merge with Lichtenstein
How exactly do you go more liberal that Sweden
Oh well, you might need The Communist Manifesto to solve that problem
I thought that knowing English meant that I would be able to communicate with locals (except for the elders) in every country I would visit
But then I went to France
Is that considered rude anywhere
It might seem a bit sad and pessimistic but there you go:
"Every place has its wounds
Britain has the fog, Egypt has ophthalmia, Wallachia has the grasshoppers and Greece has the Greeks

Haha, amazing quote
the Greek Supreme Court is Called  Άρειος Πάγος ( Arios Pagos) which is a place believed to be where Ares was tried by the Olympic Gods for the murder of the son of Poseidon, Alirrothios
The ancient Greek used that place tο try murderers and such
though i couldn't find any info to your question and i (a teenager) have no idea how those work i thought the name of the supreme court is a fun fact for anyone intrested in ancient history

I'm not gonna write the whole thing but it is similar to the English way
0-12 they have unique names but the rest is combination of tens digit + units digit
for example:
13 = δεκατρια (which is literally 10 and 3 pronounced as one word, 10=δεκα and 3=τρια)
after 21 we separate the words and this goes on to infinity
for example:

We also have the weird thing where 11 and 12 sound different than the 13-19
11 édeka
12 dódeka
13 déka-tria
14 déka-tesera
And so on till 19 where 20 is ìkosi
21 is ìkosi-ena
And basically the only thing that changes is the prefix
31 is triáda-éna
41 is saráda-éna
51 is penínta-ena
61 is exínta-éna
71 is evdomída-éna
81 is ogdóda-éna
91 is enenída-éna
And 100 is ekató
After that everything repeats it self as before but now with Ekató, till ofc you reach 200 or 300 or 400 or 500

Wrote all that and apparently no one saw it
meh
if by international fame you mean penetrating the US then the only that comes to mind is Vangelis (yep the guy who wrote the score of blade runner)
Maria Callas probably but she was born in the US
Rotting Christ, which I'm listening to right now :p
Rotting Christ \m/
Maria kalas
Gus G
And Trentemøller of course
First we give them the siima, then we pull the matto alta
> yanni
Yup he is, particularly in the past, though not as renown as Vangelis and definetely nowhere near Callas, which is seen as a national icon
I think we don't have a standard like you mentioned
People usually talk when they complain about something
One exception I can think of are taxi drivers
Sometimes they can't just shut the fuck up
My house was really far from my school so whenever i took the bus it was just me and the driver (after a couple of minutes more students would enter the bus) . At the end of the year we knew each other so well we could have actual conversations lol
Y... You're joking right
Pingu is a staple
Pretty much everyone has it, and it's been like that for a long time, way before the "hipster" wave
Young, old, babies, women, everyone
Extremely popular since forever, not to do with the recent fashion trend
I don't think I know a clean shaved man at this point
You know what they say about dwarves
beard pubes
Hahahaha
Man, I read this comment and I said to myself "this person is either Scottish or Irish" and then I saw your flair
Keep playing th harp my friend
Ahhhh fuck
I love Bill Bailey man, he's fucking gold
Very unique comedy
And my comment still applies anyway haha, it could easily have been Scottish/Irish humour
I'm here to remind everyone that we already have one cup
no need to push for a second or a third

Hebrew and Castilian Spanish
Italian
I wemt Erasmus in Italy
Loved the language
Greek
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one
I agree too, but the way they talk in Athens especially (not the sassy way we speak in the province)
Why
Hebrew is awesome
Ani medaberet ktzat ivrit :D
Ataturk and some other Young Turks like Talaat Pasha
Gotse Delchev
Ironically both Ataturk and Delchev were born in what is now Greece
Maybe Basil II, the Bulgar Slayer a Byzantine emperor
Kemal Ataturk
He is a hero in Turkey and a villain in Greece
Pretty much all of our national heroes are considered villains in at least one of our neighboring countries, especially Turkey
Yes, and also the genocide of pontic Greeks
Judgement crow stare
>so similar
Since when is Islam similar to Christianity
And I don't mean the religion but the culture
Our societies are totally incomparable
Deltsev is not a well known personality in modern Greece, not sure why he was mentioned
Have you ever considered what being a woman in Turkey means
As for religion and rules Greece is a secular society so rules apply only if you feel like it
What about Turkey
Have you ever been there
When the imam starts to call to prayer everybody stops what ever is doing, total silence
Men and women sit separately in cafes even in Trabzon
And if you go to the interior is like Iran or Afghanistan
They live in the fucking MIDDLE AGES there
>from a credible place
I have been all over Turkey except the south east
I believe Trabzon to be a rather European city in Turkey
The cafe was on the sea front
There was an aisle in the middle, at the right only men, on the left women with children
It was no exception, all the cafes were like that
Afghanistan (I have never been there) is probably a far exaggeration of mine but Erzerum was pretty close to Iran
10% of women wore burkas and not even one had her head uncovered
Alcohol nowhere to be found
The country side was mud bricks and dung for fuel
I really don't know
What do you thing would be a more appropriate word to use
My English failed me on this one
It's more likely the whole world will speak Greek, than Greeks to forget their language and speak English
We didn't lose our language when the Romans came, we didn't lose our language when the Ottomans came, I have little fear we will lose it to the Anglos
That said, I do find myself using many English words while speaking Greek (it doesn't help that I live abroad and my working language at home is english (wife doesn't speak greek well enough))
But that is normal, our language absorbs many words from the dominant language of the period and just incorporates them
Not worried we will start just using english completely though
I'm trying to learn czech because I moved to the czech rep
a few years back
I speak 4 languages to a very high level (greek, english, italian, spanish)
I cannot for the life of me grab the czech language from anywhere
It's just a bizarre language altogether
I've done a course and before covid had a private tutor weekly
I'm learning (very slowly) but it's like 10 times as hard as any other language I've learned
If I had lived in any other European country (maybe not Hungary) for 4 years I think I would be at least able to have a normal conversation at the bar etc
Not in czech though
And it's not because everyone speaks English or anything
Like I have to struggle with my broken czech almost daily
It just doesn't click with anything else I know
In Greece we have the Klephts and the Armatoles who fought against the Ottomans
Klephts behaved more like outlaws while Armatoles more like an irregular army
&#x200B;
From ancient and mythical Greece we have iconic groups of warriors such as the Spartans, the Amazons, the Argonauts, the Myrmidons, etc
The Cretan archers were considered to be the amphibians of the eastern Roman empire, as they were excellent with ships and ground battles, especially in archery
Probably sometime during the Minoan or the Mycenean civilizations
Bonus to the Minoans cause their women walked around topless
ΠΑΣΟΚ
Look at this man of culture over here
Unfortunately Poland has a very big rural population, who is disgustingly conservative in social issues (LGBT, gender equality etc) and very easily bought from social programmes because they were feeling as "B citizens" for years
PiS gave them money for children (always people with lower education have more children), for animals (farmers) and also supports their conservative very Catholic mentality
So this mixture of left-wing economics, right-wing social views and indirect bribing makes this homophobic, wanna-be authoritarian party the sure winner again
I am sorry for my friends in Poland (who are all very liberal, have tertiary education and live in big cities, aka they are the minortity) who have to live under this kind of government
Ah also for some reason Polish people STILL watch state TV (PiS propaganda tool), I haven't figured out yet why
About TV, I meant that we are in 2019, internet and social media era, there are countless sources of information, how is still relying on STATE TV possible
Even in non-PiS environments, state TV is widely known to be pro-government in many countries
I do not excuse voting radicals because they put money in your pocket
Where do we draw the line
If they start jailing people
Killing
Where is the line where "getting more money" is not enough reason to vote for scumbags
And if the 500+ stuff was enough, PiS wouldn't have launched this disgusting homophobic campaign
The fact is that Poland has a too big rural population, which is 30 years in the past in certain issues
5: Athens, Athens - Airport, Thessaloniki (the first IKEA in Greece, from 2001), Larissa and Ioannina
Apparently only 5,i never bothered looking it up because I live 5 minutes from one
We only have 5 in Greece :(
For me I would also say Balkans geographically and not at a very big extent culturally, but still I see us have some similarities to the stereotypical Balkan culture
never say that again
That would probably anger the most people
Greece is a regional power so to say economically speaking, but it's more Greece with some Balkan influences from a cultural point of view and not the other way around
No, but I've heard some people do it
Always
And everyone I know does it, too
It isn't really established here, it depends on each person
Obviously a savage if you don't, though
Sure thing, Satan
As much as I love Spain and all my Mediterranean bros, I can't forgive such an act

Tarama or Taramasalata or taramosalata
We basically call it "The Poor Man's Caviar".
Stroopwaffel
You can find them in some places in the US if you are from there
Look for LIDL or ALDI stores they have them
Any hot beverage
You put the waffle over the hot drink until it becomes a bit softer and mmmm creamy
Apparently Trader Joe has them
I'm sorry :)
Colorado greens and Stroopwaffels will be exactly like Amsterdam ;p
Zorbas's syrtaki
Fuck yeah
They're delicious
Usually as stew with shallots

but almost all Americans seem to think goat is weird

[Out of Africa]
Greece and Cyprus
Montenegro and serbia
Please don't get offended by this
Apart from Greece-Turkey-Cyprus I would also say Greece and Italy
But not all of Italy, just the south
I was in Sicily for a while and I was always amazed by how dirty the cities are and how cheerful the people seem to be despite them living with an obviously lower standard compared to the north
Also loud, a lot of fish like Greece, and a very social
I adored them
We really aren't tho
Starting with religion (which is a huge thing)
I want to deeply apologise that the replies to your comment ended up this way
Both greece and turkey are usually very civil on reddit and we usually end up exchanging wishes and/or heart emojis if Thephalanx23 doesn't join the thread
I disagree, everyone who has had even the most basic level of interaction with the other country aknowledges the similarities
We have tons of cultural similarities with Turkey, both the good and the bad things: traditional music, cuisine, a mainly extroverted mentality, toxic masculinity, political corruption
Also, I have no idea about the modern architecture, but there are loads of greek temples all over turkey's coast if that counts as architectural similarity
sometimes since Greek and Latin are pretty similar
Most of them are pretty easy since they originate from greek

Aromanian or Vlach as it's known in Greece
While Vlach means Romanian from the region of Wallachia in the rest of the world, in Greece it encompases all Eastern Romance speaking languages
The language it is used by those of Aromanian or "Macedo-Romanian" heritage
Even though the Romanians are the only people, with their own country that speak a Latin language while being in Eastern Europe
There are other Romance- speaking people here; one of them is the Aromanians
These people were essentially living in Southeast Europe where Romans mixed with the local people
Nikolaos Plastiras
He fought in the Balkan wars, first world war and minor Asia war
He didn't have a single defeat, even in the minor Asia war where Greece lost, his team was undefeated and when he learned that everything was lost, he run to Izmir and personally organized the evacuation
Noted that in the Balkan wars, he protected the Turkish unarmeds from the Bulgarians
In the second world war he was very active in the resistance during the Axis occupation, then after the civil war he was appointed Prime Minister to organize the country so Greece could go to normal elections
He then gave women the right to vote and made homosexuality legal even though there weren't any LGBT movements and the feminist movements had little to no influence back then
He got elected 3 times as Prime Minister, but he didn't own a house, but he rented because he didn't steal money from the state
When the national bank learned about it, they offered him a loan with zero tokens and he could pay it whenever he could, but he refused
During his last moments, he was laid in a military bed in his house
The queen paid him a visit and asked him why is he doing this and paraphrasingly he answered "that's the life I'm used to and I don't need anything else".
Here in Greece "Love, you are undefeatable in battle" from *Antigone* is pretty recognisable and kind of used
I have never in my life heard of "ϗ". What does it look like handwritten
Wow, I've actually seen that before but it never occurred to me that it's a different symbol, I always read it as "κ" like short for "και". Pretty cool, thanks
Obviously no, but I'd like to see constituencies have more control than the centralised Parliament, so such things aren't questioned when it comes to politics
Same with greeks
it's very annoying I hate it
Yep
We need to be noticed, and more importantly HEARD from all distances
It's our superpower
I think not only because it was in the center but also because of its Historical importance, being the most important ancient Greek city and the source of the most popular Ancient Greek people (Sokrates, Pericles etc)
Also by googling i found this
"Ancestor worship
The first capital of Greece was Nafplio (Nauplia), which was an important port in Ottoman times, while Athens was an insignificant village that attracted the odd Western tourist
In 1834, King Otto (himself a Western tourist) decreed that the capital of Greece shall be the most important city of Ancient Greece
For after all, Otto was King of the Hellenes
By someone named Nick Nicholas
Following the Greek War of Independence and the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons
Also majority of people live Athens
History and stuff
No, really, Athens was a small village at the time of our independence and it was later chosen to be the capital because of its historical significance (mostly to showcase a continuity with ancient Greece etc
"Χέστηκα" (Ch**e**stika), which literally translates to "I shat myself". This one's the most common one I could come up with
Then we have "Δε μου καίγεται καρφί" (De mu k**e**gete karf**i**), which I have trouble translating, if we were to go for a word to word translation it'd be something along the lines of "I don't have any nail that's burning"/"No nail burns for me". Not as common
We also have "Δε δίνω δεκάρα" (De d**i**no dek**a**ra), "I don't give a dime". Again, mostly used by older people
There's a lot, but the most common is
Στα αρχίδια μου (Sta archidia mou) = To my balls/testicles
In Greece it is mandatory to take ancient Greek lessons to learn the language
Most kids hate it because we have more hours of ancient Greek than physics for example
Cheesecake is Greek

I don't see the connection between the Middle East and Catalonia
I dont believe that this is the case
The problem is that Spain is a member of the EU, and Spain is a ~~federal structured~~ decentralised  country
Many things have to be dealt internally
The EU has to be as subjective as it can be and that means that in order to accept a Catalan independence everything needs to be done according go the book and the Spanish Constitution, which is going to be hard
If EU doesnt hold this stance , it will aggravate a member state, it will directly interfere in their internal politics about division and administration and it could probably lead into a domino effect
This is just one of those cases that need patience and careful planning IMO
Same thing in greek, the word for miss (δεσποινίς) is pretty outdated, and sounds very old-fashioned and creepy
I've mostly heard it used jokingly
Males -> -akis
Females -> -itsa
I suppose “-os” for males
For example:
Dimitris -> Mitsos
Konstantinos->Kotsos
Stamatis -> Stamos
Either that or just removing letters and simplifying
ex:
Ioannis -> Giannis
Konstantinos->Kostas/Kostis
Georgios -> Giorgos
Amalia -> Amalitsa -> Litsa
-ákis for males and -áki for females
e.g.
Kóstas -> Kostákis
Giorgos -> Giorgákis
Antonis -> Antonákis
and
Sofia -> Sofáki
Maria -> Maráki
The male names keep their gender but the female ones turn to neuter
Also
Males -> - oulis Females -> - oula

Am I the only one that hates this, since most of my friends and I use facebook
Also, discord and reddit (heck even instagram) dont have my favorite and most useful feature of messenger, speech bubbles ( on mobile)
I just hope that if it dies out, the next chat app also has bubbles
Although they're doing something on Android 11 with chat bubbles for all apps, but it seems kinda wonky for now, you need to pin specific contacts or something and only those contacts are permanent bubbles it seems (haven't tried it, can't say for sure)

14% downvoted, that's a lot of people who refuse to understand the basic values of the western world
I agree with him but his reasoning isn't entirelly correct
Its a slippery slope, if I ban this comic then I would restrict further and further freedom of speech to the point of people having the inability to speak about each other
Its like saying that if a parent gives soda to their kid on their birthday because its a special day, then they would give it soda every weekend , and then every day and after that they would give them cigarettes on every birthday then every weekend then every day
Obviously while all these things could happen saying that if you give your kid soda on their birthday you might give your kid crack every day isnt rational
This might seem silly but its actually important
We see this mistake fallacy used a lot lately by anti maskers "now you make us wear masks then you are going to control every part of our lives". So to recap my point
Yes ,we shouldn't ban art that ridicules religions but not because something worse might follow but rather because restricting freedom of speech itself has bad consequences on people/society
Crazy that he is basically "ELI5-ing" the basic concept of freedom of speech, in 2020
Some people might need explanations on why to breathe to survive I guess

yup the road isn't a death pit
Glad we didn't change that one
For real what are you all on about, roads are incredibly useful and important infrastructure, they also allow for easy and cheap public transport
Lets also not forget that there are pedestrian roads for high foot traffic areas and parks if you want to run around or something
As a clarification "cheap" in that a city can create a bus line with minimal cost because the infrastructure is mostly already there
Best part is when they're also filled with garbage
As if a trash collecting truck exploded in there

Europeans: The evil, lazy greeks steal our money
Meanwhile thousands of ancient Greek and Eastern roman artifacts (which they took by conquering and murdering thousands of us) chilling in Western Europe
Well,Britain can return the marbles and join the club with France, Germany, Netherlands
Most of them are based tbh
British museum has A TON of Greek artifacts
The only 2 ones that Greeks really want back are the Parthenon marbles, and the Karyatid
Nothing else
imagine comparing Iraq to Greece
Embarrassingly uninformed
For that we are thankful (even though they caused significant damages to the Parthenon in Athens)but there's no argument to keep them there anymore
Meanwhile in the Berlin museum, Pergamon Altar
In the Louvre, the victory of Samothrace
Just two other very famous ones that were stolen
Just casually justifying theft
[Yeah only they destroyed the marbles too]
> To facilitate transport by Elgin, the columns' capitals and many metopes and frieze slabs were either hacked off the main structure or sawn and sliced into smaller sections, causing irreparable damage to the Parthenon itself
> Yet another effort to clean the marbles occurred in 1937–38
This time the incentive was provided by the construction of a new Gallery to house the collection
The Pentelic marble mined from Mount Pentelicus north of Athens, from which the sculptures are made, naturally acquires a tan colour similar to honey when exposed to air; this colouring is often known as the marble's "patina"[71] but Lord Duveen, who financed the whole undertaking, acting under the misconception that the marbles were originally white[72] probably arranged for the team of masons working in the project to remove discolouration from some of the sculptures
The tools used were seven scrapers, one chisel and a piece of carborundum stone
They are now deposited in the British Museum's Department of Preservation
[72][73] The cleaning process scraped away some of the detailed tone of many carvings
[74] According to Harold Plenderleith, the surface removed in some places may have been as much as one-tenth of an inch (2
5 mm)
[72]
> The British Museum has responded with the statement that "mistakes were made at that time
"[75]

How does that compare to Greece in 2020 still eludes me
Ask the Turks and Venetians
Did you just try to prove a point with zero historical knowledge to back it up
She was stolen a few years before the Greek revolution so I wouldn’t say she doesn’t want to go back
I wouldn't mind if these countries return what they stole but that's a different topic for another time
The focus is on the Parthenon Marbles
Britain is presented an enormous opportunity to return the marbles back to Greece
Greece in 2021 will celebrate the 200 years since the Independence from Ottomans
Britain would benefit from closing an ongoing dispute with Greece, improve its relation with Greece and in return Greece could push for some of Britain's requests in the post Brexit agreement

Not to sound like a fedora tipping Atheist, but Poland is a contemporary example of a European nation where the church has managed to amass enough power to be influential

At least now we have vaccines
No they shouldn't, are you serious
The average person has nowhere near enough medical and scientific knowledge to distinguish bullshit from reality, and they just end up trusting "authorities" that tell them the opposite of the doctors
They like it, because it makes them feel smarter than everyone else and "a part of the few people who know THE TRUTH" but in reality it's just a bunch of bullshit talking point that are false but exhausting to argue against so you just let them do whatever they want and they end up dying or killing people

This has serious meme potential
Whoever gave the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle" award has some really dark humour
Regardless of the way the Turks wanna justify it, it just can't be done
They were literally fighting to keep an empire from falling apart just because it was theirs
There is no way to justify that and they were rightfully dismantled after the war
Enemies or not, relocation or genocide, their cause was a tainted one from the start
That's painful to watch

Do you think if Greece changes its name to Yunnanistan Turkey will be nice enough to give us our ancient borders back

Well even after the referendum, the vast majority voted for Tories and Labour who ran on Brexit campaigns so
Translation: If we don't like the result, it is not democracy
Meanwhile I'm sat here thinking, where could you get signs like that
Well maybe if Remain is so important then said voters shouldn't vote for parties that run on Brexit
Just a thought
Well as an outsider, the Brexit vote seemed quite clear to me
Either stay or go
It doesn't make any sense to have a vote between Remain and Norway-type deal, because it's more or less the same, with Remain being the sensible option
Looks smaller than what I would have expected
Hey if you're looking forward to visiting Greece, yes Athens is a good choice but as a Greek I would suggest that you visit one of our islands
Making a success out of Brexit is a strong word, considering that the only issue that existed from day 1 was the island of Ireland
There has been no realistic or even achievable proposal for that issue from the UK side
She should have included the Labour Party in the negotiations to make sure they knew what the real deal of negotiating such a deal is, and secure the votes she needed
Her party is filled with delusionals (or simply self serving crooks), that prefer a hard Brexit over a fair deal
The electorate was misinformed and played
Thus the decision is not a well informed one
You should try and read about demagogues and the havoc they reap in the societies they thrive in
BTW there is a reason why referendums in a representative democracy aren't and should never be binding
Brexit will show you why (deal or no deal)
No she do not
The referendum is not binding
My post implies she didn't try for that
She tried to keep her party together, and is failing at that too
Everyone else: great lads
Englishmen: they can fuck off
I definitely agree with this view of Europe tbh
I don't know what I expected, but yeah, that sounds about right for Germans
Colonization
75 years ago children couldn’t go to school because there was war
Before that they couldn’t go to school because they had to work
For a few years after the war they couldn’t go to school because schools were destroyed
Comparing the generations that actually went to school with those that didn’t, I conclude that children SHOULD go to their freaking schools and they can protest on a Saturday or a Sunday
Claiming that you sacrificed school in order to be an activist is the biggest bullshit of the century and will lead to many problems in both the children’s future and the planet’s.
A crap unscientific theory, even for the US
All I see is krieger from Archer
How are there still people out there that promote the USSR’s tactics I just can’t grasp it
Beautiful pictures ,folk dresses are always very cool
Bulgarian customs are very rich in history
Interestingly enough,we do this thing too with silver/golden coins attached to them,it reminds me of the folk dress that  women from Thessaly wear [
Very cool
Americans:
/r/europe: Haha, Americans are so upset, USA bad
Lol thank you fellow Greek
Its so fucking cringy when Europeans do this
Which part of the World is like that because of European colonisation
Greece: it's free Macedonia/Thrace estate
How haven't I seen big sis Russia yet
This was one of the best and most wholesome collab events we ever had
He married 8 gay guys
From the history books a hundred years from now:
"2020 was not a good year
There was a deadly virus pandemic killing people , at some point in september archaeologists found 30 mummies in mint condition in Aegypt and decided to open the sarcophagi, and as soon as they did that, the Titan Enceladus woke up under Aeta and decided to ruin Christmas
Thankfully the greek pantheon woke up too after 2 milennia of sleep and Athena buggerred the unruly Titan with a prize winning leak" (kudos to whoever gets the reference)
Shut up Enceladus or I m sending Athena again and this time she wont throw the mountain on your head, she will shove it
you know how it goes
Oh did the new patch drop
Nice
Can someone link the patch notes
Alien invasion coming right up
2 years ago i was staying on a village just below etna
( Linera for anyone curious )
Flew out on the morning of december 24, 2018
Literally 3 hours after i left the volcano erupted and airports closed down
Seems like its a common occurence there
2020 be like: I still have some time to fuck em up
Nice lets go and gather some gold
8 days till the end of 2020
Those days are gonna be the worst
Good luck everyone
Low taxes
Greece welcomes you to the club
It's 5°C then the next day it might be 21°C then 6°C. What is this madness
Get ready for a really really REALLY BAD SUMMER
I've got a friend in Odense and he said there hasn't been snow there since 2016, kinda odd to me considering I'm from a supposedly hot country and we get snow every year where I live (this year doesn't count cause it's globally cursed lol)
Might've exaggerated, I'll call him out
A few days ago he smoked in a bar as well, which is also illegal [link]  edit: gr link
So, here's the sad truth
He summarizes fairly well the entire political and social grounds of the country I live in, Greece
It's mostly Careless Hypocrites
That's the most greek thing I've ever seen, he makes us proud *tears*
This is a piece of shit Union thug, that used strikes to crawl up into a pseudoleftist party and now he is a Minister
His tweeter is TD tier
Like, he is doxxing people
He said during an interview that if his party wants to be re-elected, they're gonna have to start putting people in prison
The GM of the hospital he worked for was recently found out he had 4 (four) forged diplomas
When reporters asked the Minister of Health about this scandal he said "why are you asking me, I am not going to answer to you", yelled about how the press is controlled by the opposition and they only ask about the bad things and finished by telling them "all of you versus me, I have you".
And this is just one of the member of the incompetent, toxic gang of Mr
Tsipras that governs us atm
Fuck
This
Noise
That s really greek of him
...First off, fuck your bitch and the click you claim
Westside when we ride come equipped with game
You claim to be a player but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boy niggaz fucked for life
He didn't choose the thug life
Welcome to Greece
Yeah most of our government is corrupt as hell and doesn't even do what we want them to
Even when we protest on the streets
Something like in USA, maybe even worse, but nobody gives a shit because we are a small country
What an animal
I apologise on behalf of my country and on behalf of my generation of younger people that even though we understand that this kind of behaviour is wrong, the only thing we do is laugh and move on
I apologise for us being being one of the reason this continent gets bad reputation sometimes, and I apologise for the low level of cooperation my compatriots show with other countries of the E.U. almost on a daily basis
The sad part is, that people who understand that a change needs to be made on this country’s social and economic culture, often give up and migrate when they realise that it is an impossible task
I left Greece 7 years ago and still to this day I get sad when I realise the country that once upon a time promoted science, medicine and democracy now promotes extreme ideologies, lack of education and a tendency to believe that we are the best in world and everyone else is wrong when we clearly have failed over and over again for many decades to achieve even smallest level of healthy growth and development
He just wanted to show everyone how stupid people look when they smoke
Don't tell me you can find a better paradigm from that
The timing, his hands position
its all perfect
Another anti-Greek thread with dozens of northern euros flexing their superiority complex
Northerners will never change, it’s only been a few dozen years since you went on a barbarian rampage
It’s stupid to ban cigs in bars when the bar is peddling its own poison
It also depends on the bar or club from my experience, the darker it is the more likely smoking will be allowed, if there is bright lighting then less smoking
FINALLY a truly greek-wit comment
Had to look so far down for this one
Cheers man :')
Dude the man is shit but there's no one like him in the government
Well, smoking rules do not apply to anyone in Greece to be fair ... when there are so many smokers, people stop caring, so it is not a privilege at the very least
We hope to keep the peace
It's Greek, so it should be /r/notthekoulouri
[To Koulouri / The Bagel] is the Greek equivalent of The Onion
Ieremias klarxonopoulos
Hahaha I got you bro
You just have to get used to us
lmao
Is Greece looked down upon
Interesting
At least we didn't put people in ovens
**Panagiotis Kouroumplis**, the Minister of Naval Affairs that during the Saronikos oil spill (1st
2nd day
) said on live TV that people should resume swimming because it is safe
KEELPNO (our CDC) had to do an emergency information campaign because no, it was not safe to swim in an oil spill
**Alexis Tsipras**, Prime Minister, said on live TV to a victim of the Mati wildfire that "even if he gave her 2000 euros, she'd waste them" (actually the wildfire produced bucketloads of sick comments from members of the gov and parliament
**Tasia Vhristopoulou**, Minister of Immigration Policy in 2015, said that "there are no immigrants in downtown Athens, just people who are enjoying the sun"
**Christos Bgialas**, member of Parliament, said "why should a 17 year old today care about who Koufontinas killed
" Koufontinas was the main hitman of the 17 November terrorist group, which was responsible for 23 assassinations of foreign and Greek civilians
**Eucledes Tsakalotos**, Minister of Economics, said from the podium in London about the pensioners "there is no delicate way to say this, but these people will abandon the system by nature"
**Kostas Zouraris**, Vice Minister of Education "You think now we are threatened as a country, Erdogan is only asking for a few islands
Even if we lose a few islands it's ok, we'll take them back"
And so many more
These people are psychopaths
Roasted
[cries in greek]
ITS TIME TO STOP
Did he remove the spine of a homosexual to keep as a trophy
Like I've read here beore, Brexit to those who wanted to leave only makes sense if UK was the first of many countries to leave EU, since "EUSSR" is evil and horrible and nobody wants to be in it
Must be kind of awkward now, although EU still needs to reform and be more open and push for investments to boost youth employment, otherwise Brexit people might end up being right
Hungary needs an intervention at this point
It's government has turned rogue
Hungarians don't want any scary brown immigrants to come into their country, but they also don't want to work more to cover the labor shortage
They want to kick out the "evil leftists" and support a fascist government, but they don't like it when said government practices fascism by taking away labor rights
Hungarians want the cake and eat it too
That's not going to happen
Accepting migrants into your borders because the EU forced you to and integrating them into your workforce are 2 completely different things
i dont know
if i was Denmark, i would be more careful mocking the "chosen one" :)
apparently i **should had** added the /s
u/racist-femboy
Fascists and femboys wasn't a combination i expected to see today
Does he know that the "girl" is actually a man
How is he far right
He has some VERY unpopular opinions, might even call him an asshole
But far right
we have these in August, Greece, just amazing:)
Have a bad feeling we're not goint to hear more about him and sadly we will probably forget it too
Woah, I am really out of the loop, what happened
All I know from this guy is that I heard he got poisoned a while ago(?)
The fact that a person can be so stupid is beyond me
The irony
I've seen this shit by Greek fascists too, how the fuck don't they see the irony
Oooo nie thats bad
Cretin
As we say: μαλακές παντού (malakas everywhere)
European neonazis are the definition of cucks
Reminds me of the far-right party back in my country
The SS genocided entire villages, committed endless atrocities to the greek people, and they dare call themselves patriots while having swastika tattoos and doing nazi salutes
They were declared a criminal organization recently
Good riddance
I feel the same way about Golden Dawn supporters
I can't imagine Hitler had good plans for the Mediterranean peoples in a Nazi regime, at best we would have been second-class citizens
How does one just happen to have his hand in a fucking nazi salute
So you're saying they would do what, suspend the elections and take over the factories in order to bring about communism when they're in power
I just looked at their website, and it's bog standard center-left stuff
Lower taxes for the poor, pour money into public healthcare, inclusivity etc
It's ridiculous to compare them to fascists
I can see that, but that doesn't mean the party is communist lol
Just like a few Nazis voting for PiS doesn't make them a fascist party
Their agenda doesn't deviate from mild Nordic-style wealth redistribution
\*sips a cup of Remainers tears\*
Nice
Cries in Greek
The same thing happened in Greece too
Athens had special carriages to collect the bodies of people that died on the streets due to starvation
My grandparents had to sell almost everything of value in order to survive
The were rich before the war and lost everything
Their mansion was big and half of it was taken by the Germans to house officers
The "funny" thing is that while my grandparents were starving they would see the Germans bring large quantities of food for their own consumption
Never they were given anything
Even a loaf of bread
Amazing news
A dictator going down is definitely positive news, but the opposition being backed by the Church and the reason for their win being that the Montenegrins ran to defend the church is worrisome
there are already too many religious conservatives in Eastern Europe governments
Sure, if you count Turkey as European
Russia: Can't be imprisoned if you're dead
*taps head*
This comment makes images of face-lifted neon-drenched 106s and fake Adidas pop up in my head like PTSD
MP like military police
Yeah the EU would be pretty great for me
if I were a bank
or Germany
They sold MY nation to the bankers
Just to be clear this is not supposed to attack Germany but the eu structure
I strongly believe that every country is obliged to do what’s best for its people
The eu may have done some good things about social problems but has made a mess of many countries’ economies
Generally it pushes for austerity measures even though they keep not working
And the eu central bank (which is too independent to be so powerful in my opinion) basically has the power to hold hostage every members economy, sound like a system that is not very democratic
I believe that is very easy to only see the good things if you are not a citizen of  Southern Europe
It’s not all about who gets money directly
Germany basically controls all of Europe
Portugal Greece Cyprus Ireland, all of those economies were torn down but somehow Germany managed to get a profit out of it
Even the devaluation of Greek bonds was not applied to those held by the European bank in Frankfurt
And generally Europe always follows the political route that seems to benefit the German economy even if the majority won’t benefit from it
I agree that greece was in a bad place but now it is sinking even deeper in debt
Nearly everyone that has studied its problem has agreed that its debt is not sustainable(including the IMF) and should be relieved(something that was applied in Germany in 1953)
However the eu keeps pushing for reforms that clearly won’t change anything
The eurozone system is flawd by definition
You cannot have the same currency with such different economies
If Greece was not in the eurozone it would simply devaluate its currency and go on with lesser imports
But Greece traded that power when joining the eu with stability and support
Remember that the vast majority of the money the eu is sending is going to bail out banks
But its the that people have to put up with the austerity measures
I would very much like being part of a unified europe but this is not it
This is not a way that a democratic union should be
This is how colonial territories work
So in your opinion Greek people should eternally suffer the consequences of our parents actions
Since the debt is not sustainable Greek should be forever subject to The EUs decisions with no chance of ever getting autonomy
Seems fair
RIP to the people whose faces are crystal clear in this photo
Jokes on you
There is no river in Athens, we put cement all over it
I would die to live in a city like that, but I am stuck in Athens,which is not even close to anything in this map
Not Athens
I would say it's more like a map of every european city that had solid history since 1400 till now
Or map of every central european city, because I can't think of any mediterranean city that actually is like this
I do believe that abortion is murder, besides if the mother's life is in danger
And no, I don't think you should abort your child if you get raped
Adoption is always a thing
Also, I'm still sceptical if someone should abort her child if the fetus has health issues but I truly do support the protests
Edit: Me: *supports the protests*
Reddit: mm yes D O W N V O T E
Damn he was only 62 at the picture but he looks like 82
In Greece they said that not everyone can be tested and people have been turned down
WHY TF DO WE KEEP STATS AND NUMBERS THEN
sounds to me like classic misinformation tactics
This is the Greek prime minister's tweet about it, saying how he's a true friend and hopes that the US-Greek relationship will become stronger now
Now imagine if Biden ends up being worse than Trump
Did we finally elect biden in europe
Thank god I guess
Even in the european sub we have to listen about this
I guess we want daddy usa on our case
It's lovely when mods don't even follow the sub rules
Ridiculous
How does this officially happen
I'm sure that BBC and AP are not supposed to decide who is president elect, so what is the official body that does this and when should we expect the outcome
I know that Trump is butthurt and appealing so I'm wondering how long this can last and how is it normally resolved
what the fuck how have I not seen this
They don't have the senate, they can't actually do something in the first 2 years and if they go with 'bi-partisanship' and working things out with the republicans they will lose the mid-terms election even harder as they will neither have support for their policies nor will thy have anti-republican sentiment like the anti-Trump sentiment that exist now
Meanwhile republicans will fire up their base by convincing them that Biden is Marxist Devil himself
You want USA style 'democracy' to be promoted in Europe
Or do you want more US military interventions in our vicinity which has caused us so many issues we have to deal with
Angela, it's OK I'm a mouth breather
What a bright young man
And he's down with the youth too
Nothing like that old hag Merkel
Yolo swag all the way to the polls
When it comes to protests corona is like nah I respect that no infections today
It’s an actual revolution at this stage
dare I say better than the old one
They needed to fit a corner of America somehow
Italy faces new restrictions
Learn how this affects USA
What's going on
Are they cutting down the trees to make farm land or something
Also, Greece is mostly mountains, plains full of rocks where no tree can grow and sandy beaches
Greece: This is way too much *picks up torch*
In Crete where I live, there's a historical myth, that's most likely correct, that says that the island was filled with trees but the ottoman sultan cut them down for the empire's fleet
Yeah, I was there last week
Based
Cry me a river
You need to take a long hard look at why a post makes 25k in such a short time, as well as the OP and top commenters pattern of posting, instead of just accepting it as normal and "discussion".
On the contrary, I think*even more* brigading is needed, for a post on a non-default subreddit like ours, to hit the generic/non-user-custom frontpage, like this one did
I appreciate your monitoring
I don't remember that specific cows post, but was it really 3rd place on Popular/Everywhere, like this one
(Now it dropped to 6th BTW, it was 3rd a few time ago)
Perhaps we should examine it in relation to how broken the people think their own system is
I mean the US isn't a utopia, but it's definitely better than my own country's system
where are we
They are just Polishing US's doorknob
Pavlos Fyssas, Greek rapper, antifascist activist was murdered by Neo- Nazis
Another fun story is the one of Zack Kostopoulos
An LGBTQ activist who got locked inside a jewellery by an automated locking system
To get out, he had to break the glass door with a chair
When he eventually got out by crawling through broken glass, the owner of the jewellery store and a random bystander were there and they beat him to a pulp while he was in the ground in pain
Eventually the police came and beat him up even more while he was on the ground
He died on the way to the hospital
Greek right-wingers have tried to frame this as him trying to rob the store, as him being under the influence of drugs or/and alcohol, or him having a knife
All of whom have been proven false
His murderer's trials are on 21/10 (10/21 for Americans)
And nobody is in jail yet
I remember when we were out on the streets protesting, thinking we’d change something
α ρε Παύλο, θα πληρώσουν.
Ah since we're honoring this great antifascist let's all take a moment to listen to his final song, "Angela Merkel"
&#x200B;
And for our foreign friends who don't understand the lyrics, let me translate some parts of it:
&#x200B;
"Angela, I would like one day to fuck you on a penthouse
Yes and on the edge, I would hold you by the hair and suddenly upon the climax to kick you down
Angela, learn that from high up here you are like a vision splattered on the ground
I want to piss on your smashed body and play reggae bass with your intestines
Angela my baby, in my nightmare, you look like my most beautiful and living dream
I want to be a child-killer, my booboo, I want you to become the mother of my child"
Yeah, Pavlos Fyssas such a gentle soul that he was and with his noble contribution to the antifascist cause, is truly being missed
What bullshit
The guy was no hero,he was quite a fascist himself
Once again the so called "anti-fascist" are trying to play victims
They conveniently emit that their "lot" burned down 3 innocent people by firebombing a bank some years ago
I've posted the wiki article
But you're right
Also 7 years after the murder , the trial is still ongoing
Nobody is in jail yet
Edit : I didn't anticipate so much hype
I was expecting only downvotes because r/europe
Here is the wiki article for visibility
The reason for the post is that in a few days (7/10/20) there will be the court verdict
Not only for the murderer, Roupakias but also for their Organisation, the fucking Golden Dawn and their  chain of command .
And for the Greek Democracy
Thank you brother
>This honestly just feels like political propaganda meant to frame a political group as victims, in order to garner support for their radical ideology
Dead on the money
List of victims by far left terror group 17 N in Greece:
They did not call themselves antifa back then,but judging by the comments of the people here defending antifa,they are pretty much on the same ground as these
Before Fyssas was murdered, the neonazis that killed him had been normalized in the public sphere by the media and by people like you
The shameless victim blaming spree you went on in the comments doesn't say "I dislike political extremes and I care about Marfin", it screams "I empathize more with neonazis and I will act as an apologist for them".
You're making a fool of yourself, log off and spare us the secondhand embarrassment
Go away golden dawnist
in this case it was literally Nazis though
Golden dawnist spotted
Bullcrap,nobody was normalized in the public sphere,least of all golden dawn
The media absolutely hated golden dawn,they had a black-out on them and constantly ran negative reports on them,how can you say with a straight face such lie that golden dawn was normalized by media
People are quick to forget the awfulness of terror groups in Greece,while putting forth a boogieman of neonazis
Thankfully we dont have neonazi problem in Greece
One dead man wont change that fact
Even if for a sort period a questionable party like GD got some seats
I think its disingenuous to minimize the dozens of victims of radical left terror,while making a false narrative that a dead rapper means a hitler is coming in Greece
Its such a obvious false narrative
Predictable
Just because i dont buy Antifa 's bullshit,that dont make me a golden dawnist
Nuance is not a word these knuckleheads understand
"If you are not with us you are a nazi" . Ahm,no
I can be against both,thank you
Now go back to your safespace
Sorry,you are wrong
Here you go then
23 victims
5 people dead, 1 cop dead,and surely a couple more i dont remember
I guess you were abroad when Themos Anastasiadis hosted Germenis on his late night show, published fake news of the Golden Dawn lads who protect grandmas from immigrant thieves when they go to the bank or when lifestyle shows talked about Kasidiaris with the swastika tattoo like he was the new hot guy in town
Neonazis are not a "boogie man" because they are real
They repeatedly attacked people, they killed 2, they had informants in the police and they felt so comfortable and protected by the police that when the murderer of Fyssas was being arrested he told the officer "I'm one of you". If you think that it's just one dead man I suggest you read their case file to see what other charges and convictions they have on their backs like the murder of Shehzad Luqman, the almost murderous attacks on Egyptian fishermen while they were sleeping in their home, various attacks on political opponents, the fact that they had a massive armory which was "safeguarded" for them by a policewoman who **still works for the hellenic police** etc
The fact that the murder of Shehzad Luqman, which precided that of Fyssas, wasn't widely reported or discussed by the media nor were the pogroms in the center of Athens when instead they interviewed GD party members as "indignant residents of Agios Panteleimonas" who are tired of immigrant crimes in their neighborhoods along with the fact that after 7 years of trial you still think that it was the murder of just one man proves exactly my point on how the media whitewashed neonazis
How can *you* tell me with a straight face that it's bullcrap and that we don't have a neonazi problem
You only perceive as a problem only what agrees with your narrative it seems
*That* is disingenuous
"Radical left terror" and you dare to speak of boogie men lol
Κόψε τον πολύ ΣΚΑΙ
You're very clearly some kind of altnright winger based on all the comments I've seen your make on this thread
All this long tirade about "nazis"
Meanwhile the left:
23 DEAD
(excluding the 5 dead of the last 7 years from other radicals)
And thats one organisation
There were a couple more dead from different terror groups
But noooo,we dont want people to learn about that,but yell about the rapper one idiot killed
alt n right
That dont sound so bad,i might adopt it
No comments on the actual "tirade" by the man who spent his afternoon whitewashing neonazis - without quotes
Since I'm not a 17N apologist you could have sent me a link for your favorite cookie recipe and it would have the same effect
When on the day of remembering 17N victims I come with comments about how it wasn't really a terrorist organization or how the victims had it coming you are allowed to come back with your 17N wiki article
Until then your link isn't an argument
>But noooo,we dont want people to learn about that,but yell about the rapper one idiot killed
Yeah, 17N is such an obscure organization, nobody has heard of it, no one spoke about their attacks
Nobody in the world has ever seen reports on the cars burned by anarchists
Thank you for bringing that to our attention
I was living in the dark all this time
I got tired of hearing Shehzad Luqman's name on TV while they so cleverly hid 17N under the rug
The Greek public is clearly so well informed about Golden Dawn which has been around since 1980 as well as their ties within the police
So much airtime spent covering the trial - not just when Magda Fyssa throws water bottles at the murderers of her son who shout "Where is your Pavlos now
"- whereas no one dares to speak about Exarchia on the news :(
I don't do drugs but I'm always open to the opportunity of exploring alternative realities
Thank you for this
I'm sorry for my previous tirade, next time I'll exclude facts to make it easier for you to defend your insane position
Funi
There was nothing for me to comment
I posted an actual list of actual victims of terrorists and you went on and on about how neonazis did this and that
The truth is they just have not had much action in this country
You simply do not want to accept that fact
One dead man and maybe someone else,we do not know for sure
Yeah,ok
Since 1980 according to your own words
Thats hardly a killing spree,is it
Meanwhile a pile of bodies ignored from the other side
Why is stating the facts about violence in this country whitewashing neonazis
This is all tiresome,and disingenuous
Its not like people cannot see the obvious efforts to minimize the violence of far left terror groups,and what better way to do that than point to neonazis
Really sad,and predictable strategy
If the violence was coming from neonazis we would also condemn them,as we condemned the killing of Fissas
The simple reality is violence was coming from the left the 40 previous years
I see
You are not delusional, you just refuse to take in any information that contradicts your opinions
I can't help you with that
Lukman's murder is not a maybe
They were convinced
It's on Wikipedia too
I went on and on about nazis under a post about the very same nazis with the guy who went on and on under the same post saying that neonazis don't exist
It's sad you can't see the irony
Καταλαβαίνω τη δύσκολη θέση σου, συνέχισε να πετάς την μπάλα στην κερκίδα με τη 17 Νοέμβρη την οποία κανένας δεν υπερασπιστηκε σε ένα ποστ που αφορά τους νεοναζί τους οποίους εσύ ήρθες εδώ να ξεπλύνεις με πάθος. Απλούστατα δεν θα σου κάνω τη χάρη να μιλήσω για αυτό που εσύ μου υποδεικνύεις επειδή δεν θες να μας πεις ανοιχτά ότι γουστάρεις Κασιδιάρη και το πας γύρω γύρω ότι και καλά σε πονουν βαθιά οι Αξαρλιαν και τα θύματα της Μαρφιν.
Έλα σε καμία βδομάδα να σχολιάσουμε τις προκλήσεις των γειτόνων και παρακάλα να μην τα ξεθαψουν αυτά από το ιστορικό σου γιατί κανένας μας δεν θέλει να μας συσχετίζουν με τις πλυστρες του νεοναζισμου.
If you want a boogieman to feel threatened by,go ahead and believe neonazis are about to get you
You are far more likely to be a victim of "accidental" burning by one of your own anarcho-fascists sympathizers
And yes,you do not have the courage to admit the violence that the far left terror groups have done and is documented
And the anarchists are well know to publicly expressed sympathy for 17N terrorists in this country
But you are trying to hide behind accusations that i am trying to wash-off neonazis
I denied that every time
You simply cannot accept that the side you sympathize with has sympathized and enabled a terror group that was active for decades and costed many lives
You simply wont accept that your side was in the wrong and perpetrator of violence which cemented the opinion of the large public in this country that the far left are simply criminal thugs that support terrorists
Nothing more needs said
>of your own anarcho-fascists sympathizers
> You simply cannot accept that the side you sympathize with
Oh, you know me so well
>I denied that every time
Oh did ya
Was that before or after you whitewashed them
>You simply wont accept that your side was in the wrong and perpetrator of violence
Says the person who literally got triggered και μας έπρηξε τα αρχίδια όλο το απόγευμα because people *dared* to mention the crimes neonazis committed
I AM NOT DEFENDING CRIMINALS YOU ABSOLUTE DIMWIT, THAT'S YOU
***YOU***
Say boogieman a couple more times kai min ksehasis na tous valeis kai loulaki
>Nothing more needs said
Indeed
looks like a warzone
Look how beautiful this is
Thousands of people spreading COVID like there is no tomorrow
Brilliant
i notice most of them are women,interesting
maybe the rumors are  true
the rumors that police picks men and arrests/beats them up so mostly women protest atm
Nice
Shall we take a moment and appreciate the 2 wonderful flags that OP (I presume
) made
This is a deja-vu in my Greek eyes
I remember Tsipras saying "we voted to end austerity, the EU must help" and the response was unsurpringly the same as now "nope, sorry". It really shocks me that British politicians are so out of touch (unless they're faking)
I just saved it in my favorites
Loved it
I'm Greek, can we please not go back to 2015 please
Everyone in the west: "oH mY goD thE bAlkaNs aRe soOO tHiRd woRlD" Meanwhile Germany:
Edit: Stop taking this seriously I made a joke no need to get offended
I mean, isn't their election coming soon
Turkey is no different than Nazis before ww2
>No denial of genocides and massacres: This includes attempts to deny or otherwise minimize crimes against humanity that are widely recognized such as genocides or massacres (e.g. the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide, etc)
Denying the fact that these events occurred or trying to justify them will result in a ban
It's not like before erdogan turkey was a shining example of foreign (and internal) policies
Sure the current situation is highly critical and volatile but they have done shit like this in the recent past
China and India destroy the environment

Wow, I don't even have to add anything,  that's pretty much it
in Greece we don't just have socialist parties
we have a proper communist party whose goal is to remove all democratic processes and establish an authoritarian regime like those of the good old days
Well ok, it"s pretty accurate, but here the most left parties are called, universally (at least in my country) what they actually are: communist, not socialist
This is so damn accurate, the Greek parliament was exactly like this until the most recent election
Thankfully, people voted the actual nationalists

Ah shit , here we go again
Didn't that guy ruin your country
Because people obviously skipped history class or weren't paying attention during the lesson
Ah, I thought this was some alt-right party that praised Mussolini like people do with Hitler
Didn't realize it was his descendant running for office
This, and the Germans also had a hard time in Crete, dudes would literally butcher them as soon as they touched the ground (probably another reason the Germans were late to the Eastern front)
Yeah, well praising someone who ruined your country would be more stupid than voting for his great grandson

A large crowd has gathered outside the court ahead of verdict in Golden Dawn trial
Protesters chanting “Nazis in jail
The people demand it
BREAKING:Greek court finds Golden Dawn party guilty of running a criminal organization
Historic decision
Edit:The moment it was announced to the crowd
Golden Dawn has found guilty for Criminal Organization !!!
Their Leaders are gonna die in jail
ALL GUILTY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Auta maresoun
It's good to see our people finally stand up for something
Golden dawn neo nazi voters must be *Fuhrerious*.  /s
As a Greek these does make me happy, so many negative news the last couple of months/years
One of the few days in the last 10 years I've been proud of my country
For once I'm proud to be greek
They have been declared guilty of being a criminal organization
Fascism has many heads, but this one is finally after so many years, severed
Today is a good day
Ban Fascism  100
Anti-fascist raids 50
Was there, got tear gassed
2/10
You can trust us to do the right thing with everything except money lol
The court will issue a landmark verdict on whether the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party elected in parliament from 2012 to 2019 operated as a criminal organization
LETS GOOO
>Their Leaders are gonna die in jail
Oh my sweet summer child
Hell yeah
o laos apeti,

Sending neo-nazis to prison
GD even at it's peak never got more than 7% of the popular vote
The only reason they got the seats they did at parliament is because most people only vote for the 2 main parties so they snack in as "3rd most voted" with only 7% of the votes
Most of the people who voted for them were voting for them as a punishment for the previous government, that was the motto that they used mostly in their early campaigns "We will punish those politicians who wronged you" once they got voted and showed their true neo nazi colors then this latest election they got almost no votes and got kicked out of the parliament
Now followed by this
Golden Dawn had been around and was not getting more than 2% until they portrayed themselves as the ones who would "punish the previous ones for their crimes against you"
[In the latest elections Greece along with Cyprus (majority greek ethnically) had the lowest votes going to far right parties in the whole of Europe]
Don't worry about Greece regarding fascism, it will never be tolerated by the people
Greece culturally in it's vast vast vast majority from old people to younger people is based on Antifascist ideals
Odds are they were the paramilitary group for some party until they saw an opportunity to become a political party
Antifa literally stands for antifascism, it's not a left wing extremist group
If you are against the idea of antifascism, then you are considered a fascist (spoiler: you are not so democratic)
They were jailed for murders not their opinions
Many believe so yes
I think that's a little high, but I believe the polling stations that served mostly police and army regularly polled above 50% in favor of the fascists
Which isn't that surprising tbh, since those are exactly the kind of people those institutions attract
That's a bit high but it's no secret that a lot of them did
Probably they were sad about the news
[Just scroll down the pictures in the article if you can't understand the language, it will give you an idea why]
Many believe Golden Dawn had a large support in the police force
Idk if it's that or that Greek cops are cunts in general
According to sources masked men attacked the police with bottles molotovs and iron staffs
Η στιγμή της ανακοίνωσης: «Η Χρυσή Αυγή αποτελεί εγκληματική οργάνωση».
Χαμός από τον κόσμο.
Και μέσα σε 15 δευτερόλεπτα η αστυνομία αρχίζει να ρίχνει νερό στους συγκεντρωμένους!
The moment of the announcement:	<Golden Dawn is a criminal organization>.
Chaos from the crowd
Within 15 seconds the police starts shooting water at the crowd
*I would interpret that as the crowd goes livid after hearing the announcement
Greek justice system: Couple years of house arrest, best I can do
Jail can be a dangerous place for them, you know
Crimes,murders,dozens of racist hatred crimes
The list goes on
Jail is not a dangerous place for nazis
They will be guarded by people who admire them
Murder, hate crimes, attacks on immigrants and other people
They were convicted as a criminal organization
The people who started the trouble in the protest have or will be apprehended
We have a very capable police force
The trial was for a neo-nazis group that was proven to be a criminal organization
They committed murders and hate crimes
Oh they are definitely guilty
The thing is it's Greece so you never know what happens with so much corruption
Exactly
They were not tried for being nazis
They were tried for running a criminal organization in order to commit crimes
They claimed that the didn't do any of these, but the evidence proved otherwise
The protest was mostly peaceful, the police started throwing chemicals and use water hoses against the people gathered
The people aren't stupid to just sit and take it
Yes, there may be people with extremist views on the crowd that would have reacted against the police in a violent manner
But there is no way to prove that they are part of antifa
Well for starters because you probably mean "murderers", asking for murders in jail is a bit too much
Isn't the actual answer extremely obvious
Because context matters
They served their purpose in past elections, now they can be dismissed
> You must be proud
Fuck Yeah
We kicked the fascists out before and we did it again
Only this time we didn't let things go far
Yes, they are
So let’s hope justice prevails
No, because they are not trying to cause a state of terror
They only want to fight the police
At least that's what they do here in Greece
Yeah, I’ve been following the live stream online
It’s insane
But I’m relieved our judicial system did the right thing for once
Parties of hate speech lead to parties of murder
They wouldn't be able to cause a state of terror even if they wanted to
The best they can do is keep occupied a part of the police force for a few hours
They are not organized and they don't have a higher purpose than to get in a fight with the police
What you say it's antifa, it's not what you think here
Here these are the anarchists and the people against those in power
I am not defending terrorists
I am only trying to explain to you that antifascism as an ideology is not a bad thing
Yes, I agree that many terrorists have embraced it
But there are also many normal people, centrists and some who lean towards the right that are antifascist
Firstly, not all members may not have participated in the murder but almost all of them had committed crimes
Secondly, ok call antifa a terrorist group
But as long as you are against fascism and any form of oppression I won't mind

Maybe the Soviets shouldn't have advanced to Berlin after all, if the people that grew up in an age of mass disinformation and twisted truths to suit one big regime's interest over the others(cold war) can't understand propaganda from reality and start spouting nonsense whenever they see a hammer and sickle or a hint of Soviet history on this damn sub

I wanted to go to a beach at Porto heli once, and the price for 2 fucking seats was 20 bucks
I went for some food with the family with the same price per person
We had a blast
As a local, I can say that we like to sit at the beach for 10+ hours at a time
We will eat there, read a book, swim, chill, everything
I am sure no person in earth finds sitting down in the bear sand with no shade for 10+ hours remotely pleasuring
But if you live close to a beach and go for a quick splash and dash, then no problem with that
Don'e even think to mention to set up your own shade and shit, you need a really big car for moving the shit
We had a really nice food at a taverna actually
We got 2 pork chops, salads, potatoes, tzatziki, and the like for 4 people
That cost us like 15 bucks per person, and we had a blast

Avoid coffee, alcohol
Drinks lots of water, don't eat too much
Use sunscreen and fans
Don't forget that the PC will make any room that it inhabits instantly like an oven
Also, personally, if I'm home I roll just underpants, or if I'm completely alone fully nude
It won't be  45° all day
If you are home at noon just stay inside and don't do anything particular until the sun gets lower and temperature falls a bit
45 ain't a thing if you have AC
If it gets that bad I'm sure my proactive industrious belgians will buy them
Also a belgian friend (Brussels) yesterday sent me a pic of him just trying to sleep with a beer nuzzled between his neck and shoulder, was hilarious
Personally I won't even turn on AC before 36-37
House has a good airflow meaning constant draft
We use to have a nice small  open space to park our cars in my home town
Then the municipality decided to turn it into a " park". Now is a " park" mostly concrete and benches where almost no one seats

You're being downvoted because 3 attacks within a week with two beheadings fuelled by the fact that someone drew a fucking sketch, apparently doesn't consist an attack on values for you
You have people cutting heads off because they're against free speech and you don't see an attack on certain values (let alone the attack on lives)
Of course you'll be downvoted, you're welcome
Greece was probably trying to get a loan again and didn't make it in time
Conveniently missing out Greece
This is Nazi propaganda redrawn
The issue isn't that you can't be OK without the EU
As you just said, Norway and Switzerland disprove this
The issue is that the UK is ripping itself apart from the EU overnight, slowly heading towards a no-deal scenario
The UK would probably be fine if it gradually removed itself from the EU institutions, but under a no-deal scenario there is no room for any transition

In the series Germany is primus inter pares among the Axis Powers, and takes responsibility for the training of Italy and Japan
He is tall, muscular, with blond hair and blue eyes (possibly a reference to the Nazi concept of an Aryan Master Race) and usually wears military fatigues, uniforms, formal wear, or a collared shirt
Although he has a tendency to act aggressively to other characters he encounters (in particular Italy and Japan), he can sometimes show a kinder side to his personality
He is also an established baker

This definitely surprised me too
You are right the post is wrong
If it weren't for Macedonia, wither the UK or Germany would have their flag on Greece
However, countless Macedonians (mostly who live near the border) cross everyday to come shop here and what not
However, I have met quite a few Macedonians on the Greek islands and so forth (along with other Balkaners)
I honestly think it's silly that the Greek government is counting the Macedonian border crossers who come here for less than a day to shop/visit as actual tourists
I  thought it was like , some obscure isolated farmland in malta
And then there's us Greeks joining in the fun
Shouldn't Ukraine and Russia be a little more hostile in the first Pic considering they are at war irl
Social credit scores
That sounds dystopian
An example
That's bank credit score not social credit score
It's about your financial situation, while social credit score, I imagine it would be something you'd be granted for doing some socially good deed like cleaning up a beach
Banking or not, it is financial related
It has monetary value
Social credit score though sounds like "good boy points" that if you don't have enough, you'd be faced with social exclusions
No good financial score might make a bank not give you a loan but no good social score might not allow you to visit a museum
That's the difference
I am not belittling it
It's just not the topic here
It's something else entirely
Let me make an example using Trump
He is a billionaire, right
Well his social credit score would still be sub zero
Like after getting banned from SOCIAL media ot would have been reflected very badly in his SOCIAL credit score, because that's what social means
Your social situation, and it's not only tied to your financial situation but also to what this AI or whoever would keep track of the credit deems socially acceptable
I am not saying of course that financial exclusion is not bad, hell, I am a victim of it too so I know what it's like
What I am saying is that's another entirety, having a social aka moral credit score
It's very dystopian
Man, timezones must be a bitch in that area

Sadly, tis is a matter of corrupt governments and forced outside measures , not the complacency of the average Greek, that stalls us, though when a uncorrupt government came to tried its hand, everybody of the old corrupt regime tried to sabotage it
I hope it gets re-elected, for it does a decent, if very slow, job at cleaning up and creating growth, but yes, corruption is sadly worse than any crisis
You talk about the average citizen
Sure, I tend to pay VAT and not take under the table deals, as is my moral imperative to help the valiant, if imperfect, efforts of our current governing party
However, I must state that it is not some sort of moral compromise that makes people avoid paying VAT
We have some of the lower paid jobs in Europe, but, unlike other countries with low paying jobs, we also have some of the higher prices
But let me shoot down my own counterargument, true as it is, for I do not want to blame you for not going deep enough once you found a truth that seems to justify your point of view while I myself do the same: it is true that , since the era of Simitis, corruption in this country, which already existed, raged true though everyone on the population
But while at first this was only because of ease of use, soon enough it became necessity:price gougers forced others to gouge the price, and thiefs forced people with low wages to partake
Soon, a culture of outsmarting the state was created, mostly out of a perception that the state was out to get you and abuse you, and this all lead to culturally endorsed corruption
That, I won't deny, though I will deny the fact that it is a result of bankrupcy on the people's moral faculties- for Greek culture has its flaws and advantages like all cultures, and it creates many a goods and ills we could spend all day discussing
It is this corruption the new government tries to combat and, indeed, its hard, because its culturally entrenched, and for some vested in necessity, even though everyone hates it
But here's the deal, you can make high and mighty moral judgements still, for there is truth in them, but one thing is undeniable, even if the historical reasons I stated sound as excuses:
The measures forced on Greece make combatting corruption harder, for various reasons, not easier, especially the corruption of the really rich and guilty
That alone shows that the doctor is a hack, for even if the illness diagnosed is correct, he still prescribed a harmful medicine
>What you describe is what corruption does, it corrodes people's honesty and morals
But herein lies the important distinction, its not that most people did not care or find this natural, rather, it is that they find the entity they pay taxes to evil and out to get them, and that almost no one sees returns to their taxes, they consider them going to the banks and rthe rich, so they justify morally avoiding them
Thankfully, this does begin to change, especially as things are getting more clean with the effort of the new government and more returns for their taxes are becoming apparent, but it will take time
>just that the debt problem in Greece could be solved by halving (or another number, I'm ballparking here) the amount of taxes evaded
That is true, however, itis also true that the biggest evasions happen here by rich companies, many of which are international
(The fact that a lot of them are German does not escape the worldtheory of the average citizen, though I do think its a coincidence, after all, international companies are loyal to no ethnicity)
>Are you saying the austerity measures are causing corruption
I'm guessing by making people poorer so they cheat more
There is that, coupled with the elimination of a strong middle class, people most likely to pay taxes and force others to, but it does not end there
In order to crack down on corruption, money must be diverted on restructuring the services that do this job, be it getting taxes, finding tax evaders, or finding other illegal economy hurting practices, such as overworking the workers
This requires money for policy and hiring, but the EU tends to advice "no invest, only cut", not allowing such things to happen even under foreign observation
Our new government also meets resistance, which can vary from lukewarm to strong, each time it tries to ease the way the taxes are repaid in order to raise the willingness of the people to pay them
Simpler is the fact that paying taxes here are a nightmare, especially on a hot summer or cold winter, because stupid and antiquated infrastructure means you have to go to the building you have to pay, and wait for a long time behind other people, although, again, the new government tries to remedy it, easing it would take money
After that is the fact that, every time our government tries to make paying debts back easier (with, say, giving people the option of multiple payments), it is met with resistance and complains from the outside EVEN THOUGH it results in more money being paid back than there otherwise would
In other words, we lack people and infrastructure to lessen corruption, leaving us solely with the intentions of a well meaning but unexperienced government, as every more experienced one willingly perpetrates corruption culture, trying to solve unsolvable problems by overworking itself while the poor get poorer and the middle class dissappears
If not for the fact that they managed to make some profit to divert out of nothing but well meanings and hard work(as I said grossly unexperienced yet our best alternative, even though few seem to appreciate this) we wouldn't have the economic growth we have now, but instead the memorandum would have pushed us further into poverty and debt
[The picture was made here lol]
I'm amazed they even have swimsuits up there
I found what this place looks like in the winter: [link]
Im not that informed on the matter so if someone could tell me how long they stayed up there and if it was a decent amount of time, how were they fed and basically taken care of ?
They will die if left for a long time in space
As a Greek it is always fun to joke with my international colleagues how something is Greek to me (when I'm an expert or I can fully understand it)
"I am french to the conversation" sounds so sophisticated tbh, good job Turkey xD
My favorite one
WAIT, hold up, i just saw Germany
now it's close
Chinese  Greek
I am now curious to know what the Chinese expression is
In Greek another common thing to say is "alaburnese" (αλαμπουρνέζικα) instead of Chinese
I looked up the etymology, apparently it's from "Alla burla" or "Alla burlesca" in Italian and means "as a joke". Also we say akatalavistika (ακαταλαβίστικα) which means "non-understandable-ese"
Funny because greek are the base for some of these languages
[actually a constructed language in its own right]
I remember the same panic on the other side of the pond when Trump passed that law that would (reportedly) killed net neutrality

Nope, repealing NN is a huge game changer
For the US, the point of repealing NN was to allow big ISPs like Comcast to make their services super-fast and extort any competitors
If Comcast wants to make a shitty Netflix or Youtube alternative that can't compete, they will either slow down the competitor to semi-unusable levels, or force them to pay up
Nothing "major" will ever happen because ISPs don't want the public to know what they are doing
Are they against it

I just realized that all these technologies (toxic chemicals, flamethrowers, planes, tanks, machine guns, etc) were relatively recent when WW1 broke out

Lol this is normal in Greece
Maybe the trick is to make them narrower, so that cars don't fit to park
This is the case where I live, and I've rarely seen cars parked on the bike lane
However, it is a suburb
A city center is a whole different story
I guess the actual solution to this would be to discourage people from using their cars to come into the city center
Are you sure Berlin is not a city in Greece
Western Civilization in its finest
Greece here, we have 500 cases/day, up from 1 or 2 in March
Everyone is wearing masks everywhere, though I live in a big city that has single-digit cases per day
Maybe people in the country are being dumber than city people, because that's where most new cases are concentrated
No offence but that might be the dumbest thing I've heard today
Uk: WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS
Edinburgh: *SCREAMS IN GOTH*
After a trip to the Greek Aegean islands I left Edinburgh never to return
Sorry not sorry
I spent a year in Glasgow and the first time in Edinbruh I am with a friend walking around the city and  after about 3 hours of walking we realised that we have been in that spot again (I think we were in front of that parthenon replica building)
so we ask a local if there is something more we could see
we're telling him we've been to the university campus, the castle etc
and he tells us that's pretty much all there is
elated I spent my year in Glasgow

Does Taffo mean anything in Italian
Cause in Greek τάφος (tafos) means grave
Τελεταί Μπούκουρας
Fun fact taffo means grave in Greek
In Greece -Τελετέ Μπούκουρα- (a greek funeral service) has towels for the beach that looks like a coffin
His name in greek means grave (τάφος) btw
I thought it was pretty funny because in Greek "tafos" means grave
So why have they achieved meme status in Italy
Well, he definitely picked the right job with a surname like that lmao
It would be a very big coincidence if it didn't tbh

In Greece tho these roads are for cyclers

Agreed
I felt like especially the greek one was just packed full of as many stereotypes as possible and mainly how a tourist would see us
But then again, if these were more normal-looking they would probably look the same for every country
The differences aren't *really* that many
This is weirdly cryptic and romantic at the same time
I like it
I'm Greek, I visit sifnos every year and I have family there
I really liked the Greek version, i didn't see anything wrong with it
I am Greek and I live in Greece and that picture was a massive stereotype
Don't get me wrong, they were all things that some Greek people do I guess, but that is *not* how a young woman's room would look like (I am a 20 year old woman for context)
No one just keeps tsipouro in their bedside table unless they are expecting friends over for drinks, but again tsipouro isn't popular amongst young people
The religious icon is an old-person thing, again
Most young people aren't very religious, and don't care about icons
The κομπολόι (beads string) is something that only old men use
The vasilikos plant is not very common for people to have at their homes, and if they do they are at their balconies or yards - not their bedrooms or offices
Cigarettes aren't as common with younger people either
It's mostly older folks, but it is on the decline with them too anyway
I found the frappè to be accurate/typical of greeks (especially while they are studying like the girl in the painting)
The appearence and clothes of the woman were also pretty typical for a greek woman
Generally it was like a collage of stereorypical or famous greek habbits, most of which would not have veen picked up by a young woman and if they were, they wouldn't have been at her bedroom
That is not how a typical bedroom or office would look like
Idk, maybe it's because I have more of a city experience than an island one
imagine being so out of touch that you are intimated by the truth spoken by a teenager
just give a jolly answer to a jolly question :)
people should thrive on the smiles of their neighbours
This is like everyday here in Greece, but people always talk or shout, shyly or not, but you won't believe how often I've been witnessing people of all ages shouting angrily at the driver to open the door on the back when he doesn't, and usually the driver doesn't give a shit
Most recent one was a middle aged guy who, when the door he was at didn't open, he started shouting οδηγέέέ, την πόρτα πίσω! (Which means "driveeeer, the back door
", by the way)
In other cases, people may even shout something like "εεεεε!" to get the driver's attention but then not say anything else unless the driver doesn't care
But of course the driver didn't open the back door for that guy and then I'm pretty sure I heard some cursing from him
But eh, it's Greece, who expects any organisation whatsoever anyway
Yeah islands are perfect for a holiday, and Athens is good too, but if you live there all your life, it's easier to notice the negatives :p
Yeah I think you're right
I haven't tried living in another country to know for sure but that's what usually happens I guess so yeah :p

The r/atheism user woke up groggy next to his 6 pack of empty Mountain Dew cans
He lifted his 400 pound frame off his bed wondering how many women he’d be able to harass on Xbox Live today when just then he remembered: today was the day
Today was the day he would finally get a chance to debate Christian sheep and slay their god in heaven
Excitedly, he got on his disability scooter and then into his 2007 Toyota Corolla
He drove to the hospital, scoffing every time he saw a crucifix bumper sticker and made sure to situate his fedora before he got out, parking in between two disability slots
When he entered, he got his camera ready, and going up to the third floor he thought “Reddit, the last enlightened place on Earth, will finally give me the attention I deserve and recognize me for my intelligence
” He entered into the room where his grandmother was lying and drawing her last breaths
A priest was standing next to her along with her children and grandchildren, anointing her and hearing her last confessions
“This is it,” he thought, “this is where I own those religiotards and achieve victory for atheism
” He boldly walked right next to his grandmother’s side and just as the priest said “may God bless your soul,” he bravely rebutted with “but there is no god to meet you in heaven
None of it is real
Your sky daddy won’t save you this time
” His grandmother looked on him in shock, opening her mouth
But then she slouched and a long beep was heard and her mouth remained wide open
“Yet another victory for atheism,” he said, looking at his family members who were stricken with faces of horror
“I’m sure they’ve finally realized their God is dead
” He opened Reddit, excited by the prospect of the karma he was going to get by posting the video he took on r/atheism
Yeah that’s why countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia are so poor ahahaha *oh wait*
[Wikipedia] says it has 9921 inhabitants
I don't believe it
There is a myth in Greece (I doubt that this myth is old though) that when the Megareans left Greece to establish Byzantium, later called Constantinople and now Istanbul, they asked the oracle of Delphi where should they go to build their new city
She told them across the land of the blind
So they left and after some time they found a city that was built on a shore, across a very beautiful place
The Megareans wondered why this colony was built opposite the beautiful place and not in it, and they thought people who built it were obviously blind
So they understood the oracle, and built their colony in this place instead, which was called Byzantium after Byzas, the name of the Megarean chief
Yeap that's right

I don't wanna spoil the fun here but that's not the original though
It misses some part from the beginning and the ending line is from entirely another quote
by Karaiskakis again but it was something he said at another time

Certainly though the man had a way with words

Fucking Legend
A lot of people ask greeks how far back we can go in time and still understand our language
This is what we mean when we say "depends on the text"
100 κιλά έκαστος τότε....τωρα;;
He was the first shitposter
Karaiskakis,proud member of /r/2balkan4you
Daaamn that's my name and I've never thought of that
The son-of-a-bitch part is also based on how he was born
His father, an armatolos (mercenary in service of the Ottomans, initially at least) called Karaiskos, raped a nun who became pregnant
She was shunned by her monastery as well as the populace for being pregnant, so she developed a cursing habbit as a defense mechanism
She ended up giving birth with the help of shepherds
Meanwhile, the isolation caused her cursing to become even filthier, and as a consequence it was passed down to her son, hence why he'd curse as filthy as he did
His last name is also part of a wordplay the locals did to belittle him, they called him "το καραϊσκάκι"/"to karaiskaki", or "the lesser/small Karaiskos", the -aki suffix used in the same way you refer to something that's a scaled down version of the real thing in Greek, in a diminutive way in his case
He made it his own though instead
A nickname of his, "Ο γιός της καλογριάς", is based on his mother, as it translates as "the son of the nun".
Can you find it in the linked archive
There's nothing similar in that date
"LISTEN HERE YOU LIL SHIT"
He pressed the report button for hate speech
That is generally how revolutions roll out tho
The Ottomans occupied us for 400 years doing a lot of atrocities in this time frame
They commited a genocide against Pontic and Anatolian Greeks 100 years ago
They invaded Cyprus in 1974
Erdogan threatens us with war every month,they tried to send 4 million refugees through our border (they failed),they invade our waters and airspace every day and for some reason they believe that Greek islands being Greek is unfair lol

This letter was sent after Ottomans wanted to negotiate for peace lol
How the fuck is it Anti-Semitism when he is talking about people that are his enemies
With that logic he is also obviously anti-muslim
He refers to Mahmud II specifically
He was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire during that time
So u have chosen fart balls
The letter
Yes
Always has been
400 years of oppression, suppression of language and religion, as well as a constant reminder of the utter humiliation that was the fall of Byzantium for Greeks is an indicator of how much we wanted to get rid of them from our land
The ottomans were the sick man of Europe and desperately tried to contain the situation with extreme measures (like the massacre of Chios)
Yes, exactly

Quick question, what's the impact of nuclear power generation to the environment compared to fossil and coal
Jesus Christ Poland
France is uhm suspicious
You are absolutely right
Its mostly lack of political will
Although the biggest technical hurdle is the lack of energy storage and the long distance from the rest of the European grid which Cyprus is not connected
Perhaps when the [EuroAsia Interconnector] is completed, more renewable capacity will be able to be added to the mixture without creating problems to the local grid
I mean shit man, look at the Netherlands, far more economically advanced and they look similar, if not worse, than Cyprus from this graph
I'd argue that it's even worse for a rich country to be generating their power like that, yet no mention of them
I don't think you understand how big an investment it is for poorer areas to get into renewables and how long it takes to pay off
The EU's relative silence on this is ABSOLUTELY SHAMEFUL
Here's the opportunity of a generation to show the detractors of the European Project what the EU fucking is about and EU leaders are going to do what
Congratulate Lukashenko on his victory and politely ask him to keep it down
Throw out Belarusian ambassadors NOW
Remove Belarusian missions from EU institutions NOW
Send a clear message that until this election is re-held with EU observers in every polling station, this government in our eyes isn't the legitimate government of Belarus
EDIT: Enough with this whataboutism
Saudi Arabia, China, Turkey etc
Sure there are many awful places when it comes to human rights in the world
Can't we start somewhere
Can't we stand on the right side of history here and help end authoritarianism in our backyard **before** discussing taking our values on tour
Putin will enter Belarus and annex it any day now
If the EU was a thing in 1967, I would welcome its involvement in Greek matters to prevent military leaders from coercing the King into swearing a military government
Whether Greece was a member of it is irrelevant
Either you fight for the rule of law in the European continent or you don't.
Yes but do these people have NO SHAME

I am glad taxing US corporations makes nationalist headlines in the Netherlands, but the same cannot be said about supporting Greeks in border disputes, or Italians in immigration issues
Don't get me wrong, regulating big data is a good thing, but it seems the Dutch only ever join when money is to be made
Big corporations want to destroy the concept of state/government so they can become a new kind of government
What google and other corporations do is known as "starving the beast", where reducing taxes paid goes beyond just raising the value of their stock
At least we fine them and get some of the stolen money back
But it's still nothing compared to the money they steal from avoiding taxes worldwide
This is common not just for businesses but for countries too by the way
Greece for instance preferred to pay the fine for having an import law that went against EU regulations and kept it because they made more money from what they had to pay
You can be immoral and law-abiding at the same time

Aegean airlines flight over the Peloponnese to celebrate the 200 years from the start of the Greek Revolution
wow a post about Greece and only 1/5 of the comments are about our debt i love this community
I thought every country had parades with petrol vehicles to celebrate national holidays
Apparently, we're the only country that emits CO2 to celebrate
Pack it up guys, tommorow's celebrations are canceled
Greece is commited to retiring almost all the lignite powerplants by 2023 and replacing them with renewable energy sources
It is also spending billions of euros to run cables to all its inhabited islands in order to shut down the oil powered generators that currently supply them with electricity
So can you please stop whining about 1 flight buring the 200th anniversary of my country pretending as if it is going to have any impact whatsoever on the environment
Greta in shambles
Wait till she sees the military parade tomorrow
So cool I didn’t know about the flight ,btw the exact 200 year mark is tomorrow
What a nice thing to do, I hope the comments have nothing cringe to say or virtue signal about
All the people commenting about this being a waste, you must be fun at parties
Related article "passangers complain after Agean Airlines flight took 2 hours longer from Kalamata to Athens because pilot was drunk over Peloponnese"
We pay for shit like this, for an extravaganza of celebration that people won't be able to enjoy
They have closed out the whole city center for the "VIPs" only
No thank you, I won't be a part of this forced ridicule
Celebrations like these are meant for the people to enjoy, not for charles and putin and whoever the government invited
I've come to dislike how the greek education system portrays the revolution, especially during independence day
it's a bit too nationalistic, and sometimes it's just straight up nationalist propaganda
Thanks komsu <3
Oh now i understand, love means debt in German anyway but thanks I'll pass
What do you mean probably
Lol
It's not like the planes are used for anything, not to mention that demand for fuel is pretty low right now
Edit: it occurred to me that if you people have a problem with pointless flights we should just ground our airforce that pointlessly patrols the Aegean
It would save tonnes of carbon from being released, not to mention the millions of euro we would save
You must be fun at parties
I guess we will use electric planes powered from renewable energy in 2121
Yooooo there will be a military parade tomorrow
Lets fkin goooo i thought they would cancel it cuz of covid
*Technically* the revolt first started a bit earlier with the town of Kalamata falling to the Greeks the 23th of March so it was yesterday
But the 25th has become the official date of the beginning of the revolt cause tradition i guess
We have very similar avatars, half-compatriot
Seems accurate
That seems like a proper analogy for the entire country
I would say it's the other way round
Planes are just fine, they mostly use Airbus A320
But good luck going at the gate with a one kilo overweight hand baggage without getting fined 50 euros by the sleazy employee with the weighing scale
And no backpacks allowed by the way
Fuck them
Happy revolution day for you too then
It only happened once
let us celebrate ffs
Oh and [this ] isn’t cringe
Interesting
Honestly I don't know
From what I know we even opened a new lignite power plant like last year
Shame that people won't be able to attend (I assume)
The flight company can't really "loose" your luggage unless the luggage door opened mid flight and they dropped them
The loading and unloading of luggage is handled by the airport personnel, so if your flight happened recently, you most likely have to blame fraport
Even the personnel checking your tickets and luggage at the gate can sometimes not be employees of the company
He kindly says this happened because of a once in 200 years event
Modern Sparta is not the same location
Also ancient Sports famously had nothing monumental on it, not even walls
Yes that will do :)))
We did
We are gonna close all the other ones by 2023 (that powerplant is the reason I added the "almost" )
The new one will be converted to burning renewable fuels in 2028 I think
I don't have a problem watching the parade on the TV
Yes, it's all true
If it makes you feel any better we also find our buses to be insufferable
And hey, if the dude wanted to close the shop, well that's his bad
Just go to another one
The secret Mitsotakis doesn't want you to know
I get that fear, I travel a lot between theessaloniki and Crete, sometimes with a connection flight from Athens
I have had my luggage go downstairs like 4 fours in the last 5 years and I always had that fear, I never left anything important in the luggage going downstairs, only clothes which I likely have a butt load between both of my destinations
As for the Croatian guy, I bet he was clueless (I am no expert in avionics technology but I follow some news because airplanes are magical), he boarded a propeller aircraft to get from Athens to an island most likely and said the airplane was bad, the propeller aircraft use the same exact technology as jet engines but apply it differently to better match the shorter trips and speeds they use those aircrafts for, but somehow he thought it looked shady
Agean from what I noticed event updated their wings to end with a swipe up which is a 2% fuel saving trick that had started appearing in aircrafts in the last 2 decades
(I remember this from a documentary but I did notice that every plane I boarded had had those in the last 2-4 years so they do keep up with technology
Ryanair had a similar design at the end of the wings
I'm guessing it's a couple of thousands of protesters at most versus millions of bored voters, sooooo the result is going to be predictable
I get 2009 Greece vibes from this
Santorini is overrated change my mind
Mykonos/Santorini/Naxos/Rhodes are just a no-go for me
Which is sad, considering the quantity and quality of other places and sceneries
I still don't get why we don't market our winter tourism
A shame, beautiful islands all of them, you should go
Oh don't you worry, I'm reporting in Rhodes in 2 weeks :|
Oh for like army
Good luck and enjoy it :P
From Germany
ok EU does that I mean might gived money to build roads to connect Bulgaria, Greece etc whit rest EU, but why Germany
Well thay have a point when NATO set up a puppet state within their borders
>the promotion of a democratic, rule of law,
this happens for sure
Yet why Germany feels like giving money to Serbia
The guy above said " Why does Serbia get aid anyway
" gets upvoted and all
I can understand EU giving money
Why Germany gives money to Serbia for support for rapprochement with the EU
For example
Damn
This happens in most cities
What can we do to make all suburbs beautiful and worth livin
Agree
Mayday Maydya
I've been there
In the castle you could shoot a little crosbow three times to a paper target and they would give you the target with the holes as memorabilia
I was the only one of my friends not to hit it at all
Beautiful
Oh yeah, the bears
I saw a couple of them when I visited
It was about ten years ago though
Indubitably
Does he atleast drift or do wheelies with that bike
I thought it was part of the mainland , not an island lol
The first one is wrong, everyone knows Finland doesn't exist
Fuck lukashenko
I'm sick and tired of these mother fuckers playing dictators in the 21st century
Hmmm it looks fishy to me, like it could be staged
Is there some place to verify it
I find it a little strange and stupid that they would abduct a person, while there was a camera in front of them
I don't doubt it
But those things you said are in the context of a protest, not at broad daylight while nothing of the sort is happening
What do you mean
Oh so someone is actually reporting about this incident
This is what I am asking about
I could try to use google translate if it is in Belarussian
I mean report who this specific person is and why they are abducted
What a great day
Love that these countries are under western influence and not Russian
Democracy and due process are absent today in Russia
They have a ruler
Turtledoves to be exact
Doves is just wrong
There's no such expression in Greece
Not with doves anyway
For what's worth, the phrase "με ένα σμπάρο δύο τρυγόνια" refers to the [turtle dove] which at some point was eaten regularly, not the more [common dove]
They shit all over our balconies so they can fuck right off
eat the meat
The cat is like "please let me go, I don't want to be here"
So when's the fourth one
Pro-communistic
Communistic
Ex-communistic
wtf
So capitalism
Pfffff that's half of what I need to issue a drivers  license in Greece
If we can make it, you can make it too
I hate bureaucracy
That's what happens if you want to reap the benefits but not pull your weight of your membership in the EU
Please, don't come begging in 10 years
I know
I needed two tables, two visits to the tax office and 2 to the insurance company and hours of waiting to become a contractor here
Mainly two tables were because no one would advise me correctly
Freaking hours of waiting at EFKA
We had to go there at 5 am and write our names on a list outside and then take a number of priority on the queue
They needed 30 mins to process a number due to the paperwork they had to store and fill up
They don;t just have tables, they have rooms on the upper floor
Yee the most exciting thing with Brexit for me is my brand new blue passport
Sad
Obviously I'm going a bit overboard but speaking the truth it's just the papers that are on the table to issue a driving license
Temporary driving permit wasn't a thing till mid 2020 in Greece
People were/are passing their exams and they have to wait almost 6-7 months until they can get their licenses
Though with 50euros you can bribe (close your mouth) the DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) and have your license in a week give or take
2 weeks
I'm moving to Portugal  CARALHO
200 euros is also a huge thing here (it's the norm)
If you don't pay they can fail you for virtually anything
Blinker too early, too late
And most of the examiners are old and they are used to accepting the bribes
To clarify something: the 50 euros bribe is for fast tracking the process of printing the driving license
Southern European countries are in a league of their own
You can practically leave Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus  and go to Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus
The red tape will follow you, the way of the system works, the mentality (with couple differences), the land
Bye bye Brits
Welcome Scottish brothers
From Brexit to Scotlin
Sad day
I don't really like the way the EU is going, but I do believe that the best solution is to stay in and fight to make the institution better for all of us
I am Greek by the way, so I certainly have a lot of grievances about the way Ger ... (cough, cough) .. the EU has handled things over the past decade, if not more
Almost as much grievances as towards the my own governments
This country is going to shit, isn't it
Just imagine not having these wonderful EU customer protection laws to guard your wellbeing
Why not
Assuming they suddenly all want to jump back in, what's preventing them
Nein, du
Oh yes, [mommy EU from the other's day propaganda hit piece] abuse me with more austerity
tell me what a child I am incapable of sovereignty
remind me often how dangerous the big evil world will be, if I dare to leave
Brexit well deserved tbh

Hey OP, I'm writing this in English bc idk if I'm allowed to speak Greek in the comments
I find your art excellent but when I think of an average Greek home  I think of kinda ugly multi story houses( and a view of the Acropolis for extra detail) That would be more representative in my opinion, but that might be just because I grew up in Athens
You're making us proud OP
This picture is amazing, and the Easter eggs (especially the Holy Mary pic) are quite the treats hahahaha
Love it
Someone is studying biology I see

Tbh it's really hard to study with that weather
Στα ακουστικά ακούει yung Light φαντάζομαι
Nice effort, but an average Greek's view outside their window would be more [like this]
Thank you
You and me both
Thanks
But after posting I noticed I forgot to add an evil eye charm hanging from somewhere
so I guess this picture is only 99% Greek :p (good enough for this ol' cramped arm though)
That's awesome, I never thought about it that way but you're right
I hope more people join in, that will be fun
Thank you
Turkey is very beautiful as well and would love to see a Turkish version of this post
This would be dope
Yeah, Athens cityscape would definitely be more representative (half of Greece lives here basically) but I just wanted to draw summer stuff so I went for the island theme
Someone should do an Athens one
That's the village of Oia, in the island of Santorini
Thank you
Would love to see one of your country, neighbor
There are days that i drink more frappe than water :p
DAMELOOOOOOOOOO
I request this also

Haha, actually I live in Athens
but I didn't want to draw a gray city :p
There also need to be at least 1 stray dog
You're right
No it's a cig, in Greece majority of people roll up their cigarettes
Ok true
I was looking at the picture trying to figure out what exactly the scars are , and then it hit me and was like " oh
Well, better watch what you vote the next time a lunatic tries to persuade you that others are inferior than you and fuck jews
Of course Germany had the whole genocide thing
But if we ignored that for the moment, Were the bombings different
Were the German bombings worse than the later allies bombings
I am asking out of curiosity, I don't know the answer
I am not sure if morality matters here all that much (again, leaving out all the genocide stuff, or else the conversation would have no point)
Both countries are fighting a war
Germany wants to expand and the allies don't want Germany to expand because that would harm them
Indeed
Macedonia, we have a problem
The South will rise again
In unemployment
I wonder what Greece does wrong and what Greece does even worse
We do that in Greece too but it doesn't seem to work, we'll there is of course a lot of black labor because taxes for employees are ridiculous
Greece is EE and has almost the same food and weather

Yep that's correct
Basileus means king in modern Greek
However the title was used for Alexander the great and the byzantine emperors as well
It could have double meaning
In modern Greek as I mentioned is used only for king
Autokratoras is the word for emperor
The power of tea has many abilities many consider to be unnatural

Chinese government is on the way  to Belarus
Imagine if Turkey was on the map
Recently our government threw away taxpayer money to TV channels, newspapers, internet pages and blogs for the stay home ads during the Corona virus lock down
And now almost every journalist is kissing the governments ass calling out prime Minister messiah and shit, they gave money even to sites that are closed until construction etc but refused to give money to a very popular newspaper only because it's more left leaning and is constantly exposing government scandals
apparently greece went from 89 in 2013 to 65 today
Still a shitty rank for an eu nation but at least things seem to be getting better
I do not understand how we are below Poland, our press has issues true, but there is nothing even close to the blatant propaganda machine of TVP
I wonder what's the criteria
And it's not like I trust our own media, I know they are corrupt
But I also know that German ones aren't much better, from the way they covered the financial crisis
We were land of the free for you ancestors, when it was European countries that failed to provide them with a livelihood or the ability to practice their own religion
For what it's worth, the US has very few laws controlling what journalists can do
You have a very problematic perception of "freedom of the press".
Edit: let me help  [
So because we tried to reign in the the state tv and state news agency
&#x200B;
State TV and news agency having become the de facto mouthpiece of the previous radical leftist government and obviously that's all good and proper for them
New center right government tries to sort them out, and immediately they subtract points from freedom of press
Are they kidding us
These guys did nothing but glorify and worship SYRIZA and thoughtlessly reject all criticism and shamelessly attack critics, day in, day out
&#x200B;
Not really a fan of ND, but they did make a step toward freedom of press cause the State TV had become a cesspool during SYRIZA
Poor Norwegians
Do you want Greek passport to travel freely
What exactly makes a passport strong
Eyoooo what's good, Greece kicked some asses lololol
I know it's stupid let me be happy godamnit
I always love seeing Cyprus in there it's like a contrast to the whole middle east haha
Wow I didn't expect Greece to be so high up
Same with Greece except with debt
I spilt my drink reading this ahhaha
Huh, classic
We love you Viking bro :P
Friends mess with each other
We love you just for calling us Hellas tbh
Why must you hurt me this way
This is not a country ranking, it's a passport power ranking
A better way to show this would be something like this:
Rank | Passport Power | Countries
1 | 135 | Germany
2 | 134 | Finland, Switzerland, Spain
3 | 133 | Sweden, Austria, Ireland, Italy
4 | 132 | Greece, Netherlands, Denmark, France, Belgium, Hungary, Portugal
etc
Can't promise anything
Hellas (Ελλάς/Ελλάδα) is what we call ourselves of course
>The wehrmacht were good actually and everything was the SS and hitlers fault
I think the *official* term is wehraboos
It often leads to "well the Soviets killed more than the Nazis" which is very very close to Nazi apologism cause the reason the Nazis didn't kill WAY more than the Soviets and didn't exterminate entire ehtnicities, is cause they lost

Also, Greece with that measly coastline
This is a travesty

I can't say if it's bias or not but there is no better climate on this earth than the mediterranean climate :P

I love how the OP _kinda_ tried to list the countries in alphabetical order in the title, and then just said "fuck it"...
It sort of started alphabetically then he realised he missed a few countries and put them wherever on the list :P
What a horrible place
As a Greek I think this distinction is meaningless
My people weren't even the same country,  yet had coherent religion and language
They were the same people in Alexander's time, under roman control and under Ottoman control, yet you claim because there was some shuffling in the highest levels of government that somehow makes the ottomans other than the Turks
Mental gymnastics at its finest
Just no
The Roman empire had tons of ethnicities as well, yet they were all Roman, and more than anywhere else in the empire the Italians are the main 'successors' of that Empire
The Greeks are the main successors of the empire of Alexander, even if it last 5 minutes
The Mongols are the successors of the Genghis Khan's empire, the Brits of the British Empire, even though all these empires had multitudes of ethnicities and languages it's widely agreed who are the 'successors' trying to deny that Turkey is the successor of the Ottoman and Seljuk empires is just intellectually dishonest, as is denying the genocide
First 2 points are inane, but the third is funny
They are considered the successors of the Roman empire just about everywhere in the civilized world
Wait are you arguing that Italians are NOT successors of the roman empire

Classification of EU regions
our transition regions go from more developed to less
Source
Criteria
I find it hard to believe that Salonica is less developed that Chalkida or the North Agean islands
Source:
how is thessaloniki less developed
it should be blue lmao
when you're from northern Greece
I refuse
Mfw Thessaloniki is considered poor
By whom
On what criteria
Attica (the region surrounding Athens) is developed
Funny how the capital city it contains is not
How is Central Macedonia less developed and western Macedonia a transition region
Eastern Slovenia weak /s
By that time Mars would be blue too
Mainly cause of their Metro

Supposedly, it'll start making stations available in '22 or '23
I think the Thessaloniki metro was planned before the Athenian one
How come they couldn't get to Greece
Next: greek cities founded outside greece
My thoughts exactly
Maybe because it was founded upon an already existing ancient greek city

If they discover a bone we'll finally find out if the albanian claim to be illyrian is true
Imagine thinking albanians have anything to do with ancient Illyrians
Also that helmet is Greek despite being called Illyrian
Look it up
Btw why would someone be proud of being of Illyrian origin
They were barbarians
The Illyrian history is all about being defeated by the Greeks and Romans lmao
Called it as soon as I saw "Illyrian" on the title that the thread would devolve into a Kosovo struggle session LMAO
The helmet is of a Greek type, now we cannot know where it was manufactured
Also, saying that it was Greek kinda misses the point that the Illyrians were using these types of helmets as the Greeks were the most technologically advanced (''the most civilized'')
" It originated in Peloponnese, ancient Greece,[2] and was developed during the 8th and 7th centuries BC (700–640 BC)
[1][3][4] Accurate representations on Corinthian vases are sufficient to indicate that the "Illyrian" type helmet was developed before 600 BC
[5] The helmet was misleadingly named as an "Illyrian" type due to many early finds coming from Illyria
Bro I'm a communist I'm as far from a nationalism as it gets
Half the people in my friends circle are albanians I love albania
But I don't get this "illyrian heritage" stuff because there's no proof of it
And some of my albanian friends agree
Congratulations

Here the news said there was around 29k victims, what's wrong with those numbers
sorry for your loss
The situation has been less tragic than in other countries but still there are some tourist that arrive to the country without knowing our measures against the spreading of the virus such as when it's mandatory to wear a mask and when not
Originally , we reacted incredibly fast, cause we saw what was going on with our neighbor Italy and since it was so close to us and the government knew that our healthcare system wasn't in not way build to support a massive influx of patients and cases they shut the country down incredibly quick
So we pretty much survived the 1st wave without major "damage".
The issue however is, much like the government knew that the healthcare system wasn't build to support a hard hit from the virus they also know that Greece's economy can't support a non tourist year, so they are literally opening the country up with "restrictions" that unfortunately are just for them to be able to say "we put restrictions" but they really aren't substantial ones
So the result is, people from countries who hadn't contained the virus well at all, started coming to Greece and then the new cases started going up by the day, it's at somewhat 50+ new cases a day now and it's gonna get worse
It's pretty much inevitable
Thanks

My Greek ass is struggling to believe it
The other day we were having a nice chat at work
I think it was something trivial about where to go on vacations and ranking local people based on hotness
We're quite the international team, so opinions greatly varied
When it came to Turkey a Cypriot colleague of ours expressed the opinion that she could never ever see a Turkish person this way, possibly never even as a friend
This was kind of shocking for us, knowing her, because she is very much a good person, and at first glance it seemed seriously closed minded, so we pressed her on it
She told us that when the invasion of the island happened, her father fled instantly and her grandfather stayed behind for a while to try to convince he her grandmother to also flee
But she  would refuse to leave her only house so she stayed behind
She was never seen again and was presumed missing by the Cypriot state
One of many civilians who were killed in occupied Cyprus
She told that that she harbors no negative feelings for those not responsible, but she wouldn't be at ease at the possibility that a Turk or Turkish Cypriot that would be her closed friend or loved one would end up being related to the people who killed her Grandmother for no reason
There really wasn't hate in her words, just legitimate concern and sadness
She even told us that she have visited Turkey and loved it, and that she is pro-unification
I always was of the opinion that the Cypriot issue should in one way or the other be over by now, but as I now understand it there is still a lot of bad blood, so I am not expecting it to be solved at least for another generation
EDIT:
Dammit this would be a fascinating discussion that I wasn't around for
So, for the record: I agree with all of you and everyone else does and she kinda does too, but for her it's also personal in a way that it isn't for me
It needs to be said however that the vast majority of Turks make reconciliation like what you are describing damn hard
You need to absolutely part with the idea that Turkey is an enlightened nation ready to examine its past or that the majority of Turks condemn these actions because they just don't. It will be generations before Turkey gets there, if at all
So for her, right now it's just bad blood - a feeling of fear and anxiety
On a followup to the above she said "Maybe I am just not ready to have to discuss with a Turk if it is moral that a Turkish family lives in the home that my Grandmother refused to leave and was presumably killed in", at which point I and everyone else knew not to push the issue further
This is a statement I definitely sympathize with even if I disagree with her on principle
Actually the Turkish army captured Greek cypriots and imprisoned them or tortured them or even executed them
IN FUCKING 1974 IN A CIVILIZED GODAMN EUROPE
Let's see if there are more Turkish spammers than people interested in the picture here, check the downvotes/upvotes
Only Turks take pride on the loss of human life
Don't even have to scroll by controversial this time
Out of curiosity ,what do most actual Turkish Cypriots think of the Turkish settlers
greetings from Athens
There were documents exposed recently stating how US was involved as well(cia & Kissinger)
Technically, yes, and then Turkey decided it's their turn to fuck shit up well after the Junta was toppled
Excuse me but are you talking about things you have no education on
The reason Greece attacked was because there was a right wing junta that was helped even by the CIA in the mid 60s-early 70s. Also even before the junta Turkey had plans to invade the island and president LBJ said to turkish president that if he attacks there will be repercussions
That holded them off until the junta gave them a free pass to fully invade and massacre civies
I understand that my country was not right but its not black and white
Even after our government became democratic, even after 40+ years of stability Turkey still has its army on the island illegaly
The only thing greek junta did is give them the perfect reason to attack
After all those years they "still need to protect their people" sure
Also since i dont think you arent very educated on the Greco-Turkish relations check the Instanbul pogroms of Greeks in Istanbul in 1953, and then come back and tell me Turkish only cared for their safety
If you want additional info check on the Armenian-Greek and Assyrian genocide in 1914-1921
But i guess a northern German obviously knows about all these aforementioned things
Shame EU as a whole didnt do anything all these decades but opted to let Greece protect its borders alone
Turkey is by far the worst NATO ally
Imagine knowing 5% of the story and expressing an opinion
Here is a more accurate account of what happened
Greece was governed by Junta (i.e., a military coup/dictatorship) at the time
They supported a coup at Cyprus, with the goal of reunification of Cyprus and Greece
Note that reunification was generally something Cyprus wanted, who was 90% greek, but obviously not in an undemocratic way
The coup in Cyprus was instigated by EOKA B, a paramilitary/terrorist organization of greek-cypriots, who also started attacking the turkish-cypriot minority
The turkish-cypriots also responded with paramilitias of their own
Note that this was not the governments actions, from neither side
There comes Turkey with a small invasion to protect the Turkish-Cypriots
Nobody really is against that, it was probably the right thing to do
Then a bunch of shit happened, that will make this text too long, but Turkey proceeded with a second invasion with the only purpose of grabbing land
They grabbed around 30% of the island and remained there for 50 years and counting
A population exchange was agreed and there were a shit ton of people that had to leave their home
Turkey also pushes people to the island to increase their puppet state's legitimacy and doesn't even operate at the best interest of turkish-cypriots anyway (see clashes between the turkish-cypriot president and Erdogan)
And then they just decided to invade 40% of the island *after* the Junta had already fallen and brings tens of thousands of settlers from mainland Turkey, why exactly
Turkey didn't go there to protect anyone and it's evident by the second invasion
Found the Turkish immigrant
You literally know only about the first invasion, right
Sad
I love how turks say Greeks play the victim when they get invaded by terrorists
You can joke about it
Fear is a mechanism that Protect us and we should listen to it
She has every right to be scared
oh boo hoo tell me where I'm wrong
Im pro EU in a lot of ways
I think my country has benefited greatly and has provided a good aid to EU too
But since i notice and criticize heavily both national actions and EU - NATO ones, i cant help but notice how no one cares about the aggressive attacks Turkey, a Nato member, has been creating for decades now
Neither EU nor Nato are reacting and the German policies are rewarding Turkey instead of helping Greece defend its borders
Everyday we see enemy aircraft enter our airspace and ships tresspass our sea border yet no one supports action because they dont give a damn
Saddening really, to see only a few countries like Italy and France somewhat supporting us throughout this whole ordeal .
Lmao and there it is, your true face is showing
You didn't answer me though
If Turkey went there to protect the Turkish Cypriot citizens, why did it occupy 40% of the island in a SECOND invasion AFTER the violence had stopped and AFTER the Junta had fallen
Yep, its even a saying in my country, about complicated things , we call them the Cypriot Issue
If my statment is too dumb then why do you even bother
What are you talking about
Are you trying to change the topic or something
There was violence and Tutkey invaded the first time, occupying 3% of the island
Then the violence stopped, the Junta in Greece fell and there was a ceasefire
THEN Turkey violated the ceasefire, invaded a second time even though there was no danger and the violence had stopped and the Junta was toppled, and it occupied 40% of the island and then settled it with settlers from mainland Turkey
All this proves that Turkey didn't go there to protect the Turkish cypriot citizens but it just wanted to occupy as much of the island as it could
Why else would it do the above when there was no longer a danger
Turkey did what it blamed Greece for trying to do and you're here lying about protecting the citizens
So stop running away from the question like a hypocrite that you are, and answer it
Why did Turkey did all these things AFTER the Junta fell
Everyone is saying that, not just me
In case you haven't noticed the entire world is against the Turkish occupation and that's why no one is recognising your banana republic in the north
This wasn't exactly a war
Per the Treaty of Guarantee, Turkey was justified in *intervening* in case something like that happened
In no case was it justified to occupy the island
That goes directly against the meaning of the treaty
Admitting that you occupied the island because you wanted it and saying that we're lucky that you didn't occupy all of it shows exactly that you don't give a shit about the Turkish Cypriots, you just wanted the island and you're a hypocrite for bashing Greece about the same thing while hiding from your country's real motives and that's why every other country in the world is considering Turkey to be the aggressor and occupier
Its amusing how for a country that's so obsessed about honour etc you're so shamelessly lying to yourself and you're afraid to admit your country's shit
I'm happy that you know all that :) I'd ask you to be a man and at least admit that you just wanted the island instead of hiding behind your excuses of protecting the Turkish Cypriots but that would imply that you have balls and well
Of course you don't care about the truth that you're avoiding to mention
How convenient eh
Sorry if my banana republic comment (for the TRNC) hurt your feelings, I understand that given your country's situation the past few years this must be strucking a chord
Lmao seriously dude
A map by some analyst from 2014
How long were you googling trying to find that
Looking at Turkey, this map didn't age well at all :')
You can tell it was before the coup and all the shit with Erdogan eh
It's telling that Greece is way more stable today even after all the crisis thing, than Turkey is
Man that analyst must be pretty embarrassed for his predictions today
Again, thanks for making your hypocrisy evident
Like I said, Turkey only cared about taking the island, not about "protecting the Turkish Cypriots" so quit your bullshit
This is why every other country is calling you out on it :)
We're fine with it
Turkey is a joke today
Keep doing what you're doing, it's working for us :)
This basically
Is this real tho

Hello to you too Oriental sister
Greetings from Greece
City at war
What, depth
I have yet to see someone in Greece celebrating the srebrenica genocide
i am honestly humbled and honored that we are the most googled country in cyprus
Is that before or after a trip to Austria, Czechia and Poland
People are getting fed up of neo-nazis ruining  society
That's some prime /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM material right there
When in the entirety of our post-1990 western world, the only extreme on the rise is the far-right, often in the innards of the supposedly "reasonable" mainstream parties (e.g. US Republicans), it's dishonest to try to frame the situation as "50/50 danger from both extremes".
I am confused by the former Yugoslavian states
Did they had separate laws, or did some states biefly outlawed it after the war and then reversed that decision
This is Calypso, the cat of the Greek president
Calypso is a rescue too

For those who don't know
[Calypso] was a nymph in the Odyssey
This is the first time I see anything about the Prime Minister and I don't cringe to death
The president should stroke her pussy
(sorry, I could resit)
It's either Greece or Romania that start something in this subreddit always I swear
Same just recently found out and thought it appropriate
I believe so ues
Technically true
First we get the islands
Then the cats
Why do u cringe
She sure should
Turkey
Can't go lower
No, it wouldn't, but Galipso would work, as gali is ancient Greek for cat
I can't stand him
I see everything wrong in him with todays Greece
I can't stand the bootlickers he has around him, the fascists that infests Nea Demokratia and the way he acts in general
Because they get upvotes in r/greece if they say so, and they do 24/7
Cause he's the prime minister
Galypso would sound better

practical but not really fashionable
They use a ski-lift to get to the top and hike all the way to the bottom which makes the hike more enjoyable and less tiring and timely-efficient
At least here in America I have yet to go on a hiking trail that offers lifts
mark my words folks: a day will come, when germans will not need their passport to travel abroad during summer, just displaying their long socks with sandals will be enough
Well I dont disagree with you
After all this it s a trait that people make fun of but secretly are jealous of
Practical is more necessary
I wore a poncho to a day at a music festival here in America and got weird looks
Then it started raining *really hard* middle of a concert and people were scrambling like hell
It said it was going to happen in the weather people

I am afraid it's the same way in Greece as well
You are talking in abstract hypotheticals and political philosophy
Sure, communism in its proper definition is nothing close to the socialist totalitarian regimes we saw in reality, but those regimes were the only ones to gain power in the name of "moving towards communism" And we can see now that they sucked and the few ones that didn't suck were crushed by the terrible ones (see the end of catalonia in the Spanish Civil War and what happened in Czechoslovakia in the 60s)
I believe einstein put it best honestly: "the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result".It's time for everyone to come to terms with the idea that communism has been so thoroughly tainted in the eyes of most of the public and it can't be achieved, at least not for the next 100 years or so
Regarding your first point, fair enough
Proper intellectual discussions about these topics are lacking indeed
As for your second point, I saw in the other comments that you weren't a communist, it wasn't meant as an accusation but rather a general point
At least you've got high speed internet
Imagine paying a year's worth of wages over a snake bite
**this post was made by the European gang**
Do you need to visit the US to laugh at Americans claiming US has never started a war, that in Europe there are death panels in healthcare or that the EU is a socialist organizations ?

Joint 3rd babyyyyy

Acting in porn =/= whoring yourself out
There's indeed exploitation in that industry, but it's literally just another job
I'm from Greece and I had never heard of it before
Well I am usually freezing during the 10C winter
Greece at 20°C: "It's kinda chilly today, let's wear a jacket
Around April when I kept saying to people that it doesnt make sense to blame Chi-na for this, but your governments, people kept going on about how they hid stuff etc
As we see here the US had its first cases couple of weeks after Europe in general
3 months later, they are not even close to tackling this
Considering the size of their country, one can say that California and New Jersey can be seen as two different countries almost
Yet we see this
I mean did interstate borders ever close
Cause that's a big difference
Also i like how most if not all the media blame Trump for the 2nd wave (100% at fault for the first)  whilst not even daring to mention the effect that the protests and the massive crowd gatherings may have had to this
Im sorry but putting cases in a graph is pointless
The numbers are extremely affected by how much testing is heing done
This is why im usually upset when the same people who made fun of those denying the facts about coronavirus, are now keeping their eyes shit and fear monger that the US is having a huge increase in cases where the cases are actually going down (ill explain why)
I would much rather have the graph show deaths or hell even estimations of the total cases
So far the best way to calculate the total cases was looking at daily deaths, looking at the history of the pandemic in said country and taking into account the confirmed cases
And when u say take inti account the confirmed cases, i dont mean "oh we have 4 now it was 2 yesterday so its worse". Obviously the more you test the more positives you will have
And the US did increase testing
So while the deaths in the US have gone down by a ton (considering how fucked they were) people scream about the huge increas ein cases like its getting worse when the daily deaths keep dropping, as do the cases that are in need of hospitalization
So anyone reading this, please dont feel like "oh the virus is over", but check the numbers yourself and use critical thinking
I personally live in Europe while my brother is stuck in the US (i left just before the virus, and funnily enough the first case in my state happened in the university i was going to lol)
Edit: im not defending the US jeez, i just want better stats
Sorry if i made people upset i just saw the downvotes
You are acting as if all european countries test the same, both in method and in amount
Which is wrong
"The country has ramped up testing capacity to more than an average of  478,000 tests per day in June, compared with an average of over 345,000  per day in May
" Thus by doing more testing you are gonna discover more cases
here are the stats in Europe:
(this is total, not per month)
Even when you take each country's population into account, the data is way different for each country
Hell im not even gonna talk about some eastern European countries just didnt test a lot so that their figures stayed low (not the only factor that contributed to low stats but one of them) source: [
&#x200B;
Either way though, my point wasnt to say "oh USA did better than the post tells us grrr grr
" Obviously the US did shit compared to Europe
Im just commenting on how confirmed cases alone are a bad way to measure these things
You can cut down testing and you will have lower cases
in "Europe" in the graph you mix the data of countries with good transparent data and a fuck ton of testing with countries that werent that transparent and did lower testing
Or countries that started lockdown early and those that started it late

"Forever your stars will shine on a Unified Europe
Hmm nice phrase
Let me just give it a rusty try through my ancient Greek:
"Πᾶς χρόνου ἀστέρες σοί λάμψουσιν έπί τῆς Εὐρώπης Ηνωμένης."
And in Greek:
"Για πάντα τα αστέρια σου θα λάμπουν πάνω σε μία Ενωμένη Ευρώπη."
There we go (I think)
Greetings from Greece <3

And here's to hoping that the non-European Islamic dictatorship across from us that shall not be named never ever joins
A lot of nationalistic idiots spewing their hatred in the comments
Excellent post OP
With a bit of luck we will see a European federation within the century
It's anti democratic because, like it or not, the bigger and stronger countries have a bigger say that smaller ones
Noone in the union cares about the opinion of Portugal, Greece or even Denmark for example but everyone listens closely when Germany is speaking
Perhaps but most likely not
The EU is not built on conquest and slavery like the Roman Empire
Bad as always but there is no real anti European sentiment
All parties worth a damn are pro Europe and anti authoritarian
That is not to say that the inability of the EU to punish turkey hadn’t hurt its reputation but nothing that serious
Emmanuel macron is way more popular than our prime minister right now
Yes, that is all true
On paper that is
The views of every country are clearly shown, represented properly, discussed thoroughly and then simply ignored so that the big players can do what they want
As far as I am concerned Germany and France where the ones that wanted to open the borders of the EU to millions of unlawful immigrants because they wanted some cheap labour
They didn't give two shits about the problems that this could cause to everyone else in the union
The population of a member state doesn't mean anything
When I say "big" I mean the military power and the geographic space available to build more stuff that will make you richer
Every state has one, equal vote
When, let's say, 5 members use their power and influence to shift the entire union towards their desired outcome is no longer a Democratic system but an Oligarchic one
The USSR was also built on conquest and military enforcement
Multicultural empires have been the norm for centuries
Rome alone lasted for a thousand years and it was a lot more unstable than the EU
Once the economical crisis subsided they lost all possible support
Sadly they were replaced in parliament with a snake oil salesman with more or less the same ideas but without being openly Nazi
Still, their trial was a great win for democracy
Why isn't there any street view in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Moldovia

In the winter the snow was very bad quality in my opinion it melted easily but now it seems thicker
Well, in Greece, in Evia, there's always 1 week of snowfall that's brings snow to 2,5m in height
And in northern Greece, higher than that
Yes
And a lot of it
In Evia, an island, it snows up to 3 meters in January
And in northern Greece
In fact, just two days ago, it poured a lot of snow all over northern and central Greece
As a Greek to a Turk, let us not forget the countless villages in Ottoman times where Greeks and Turks lived at peace with one another until opposing sovereigns tore them apart
Really sad
I had a medical circumcision in my teenage years and it was so painful, it took me about a month to stop feeling that pain
Doing this on toddlers for religious reasons is inhumane, and in my opinion nothing short of torturous
Well things within the EU are quite boring so it helps breaking out of the boring routine
"Too much peace" becomes monotonous after a certain point

Argos is older than Athens, it's been inhabited continuously for the last 7000 years
That's a good question
According to wiki Argos seems to have been inhabited continuously for the past 7000 years which would make it probably older than the Minoan civilization
Maybe it's a guess that it was indeed inhabited *continuously*. Or maybe because it's so old it doesn't count as a civilization per se but just as Neolithic settlers
Not sure
It would be great his detail be like that

I think the two Greek ones should be the other way around
τ and θ are in the common Greek alphabet and extensively used, I don't know how "No" from those leads you to (common Greek) Greek
Also modern dialects in Greece all use the same exact alphabet, maybe with the polytonic system, their differences are in pronunciation and spelling of certain words
Where's our beloved letter "Δ, δ" (Delta)
Meanwhile in Greece: "Yes, Yes, Yes, **NO**"
If we were to get really pedantic, there is a word with ancient origin but used in modern ([ατθίς] that was that combination of consonants

What a load of rubbish, pointing the finger at Cyprus for using the veto in exactly the same way as every EU member in EU's history
You know very well why Cyprus is vetoing the sanctions and it has nothing to do with Belarusian regimes
Plus, this is [more than just a veto]
>After the meeting in Brussels, word got out, however, that the FAC failed to agree on sanctions against Belarus because of Cyprus’ demands on Turkey
>But Christodoulides said it wasn’t so
>He told CyBC on Wednesday that during discussion in Brussels, a number of countries backed the position that the process should be based on the political agreement in Berlin
>“Some other countries, headed by Germany, said that in view of discussion at the European Council on the whole spectrum of EU-Turkey relations, their approach, of the German Chancellor, is that this issue is referred to the European Council,” Christodoulides said
>“We said, that based on the agreement, both issues ought to be promoted to the European Council, which is what happened, nothing more, nothing less
>He said that when a state strongly about an issue it is placed high on the agenda and if unanimity cannot be reached, this is respected and consultations are promoted at the European Council
>“It is not as if there was a vote and Cyprus vetoed a decision,” he said
“In no case do we link the sanctions
In this case, there is political agreement achieved at foreign affairs ministers’ level
The sanctions on Belarus will be imposed, whether it is today or in two weeks time, that won't really make a difference
I love people blaming Cyprus
The turks have been drilling inside their waters for over a year and the EU told Cyprus to kindly shut the fuck up while sending their thoughts and prayers
What ever reasons you people might have for sanctions on belarus turkey has done worse
Baltics want action against belarus-Russia Cyprus and Greece want action against turkey
We can have both or we can have neither

This little bust is all that remains of Leopold's legacy
No other statues, no paintings
Who are they kidding
Despite that I disagree with removing and cancelling any form of art (even though Leopold is one of the few who probably deserved to be removed, from all the historical figures who have had their statues toppled), I have to call it as I see it: This is hypocrisy from the Belgian state
If you're going that way, then remove everything Leopold not just this little bust

Yeah while I agree that the events in Kosovo, that led to the bombings of Serbia (then new Yugoslavia), most probably were a necessary evil to remove a crazed dictator, I would like to point out that Srebrenica is in Bosnia, which is on the opposite direction from Kosovo as far as Serbia is concerned
You may think that the two events are related, but they are really not

I am sure in Croatia, there is some of this Overlap
And don't even get me started on the Baltics
No problem
The regions aren't set in stone
Just making a joke
But I don't think eastern European is an insult
Despite the mental gymnastics some of these maps do to not call some countries eastern, I've never been ashamed to call myself an eastern European

But we have to wait to learn who did it and why

Greetings from Greece
What is that dash in front of some temperatures for
I live in Athens, a city that sees proper snow for 1-2 days a year it will most likely not snow this winter for a single day and I'm jealous of you guys
Typing this to give another perspective on "bad weather" periods because I imagine that some of you guys are sick and tired of gloomy and snowy days
But when you live in a country with ~6 months of summer, "bad" weather isn't that bad
I live in Greece and when i was returning home a couple of hours ago,the inside of my car was so hot,that i had to turn on the air condition
Is it me or winter has finally come

You guys should build a heat pipeline to Greece in exchange for some debt write-off

Bit melodramatic much
Practically all royalty have no real power
At least with monarchs you know they are shit/good
When you elect you basically take a gamble to see if they will actually keep their word
At least thats the feeling I get here in Greece, everyone is promising to save us and everyone else is a shithead that will bring us to ruin
There is very little you can do to ensure that you'll get a good one, just vote and hope for the best
I don't disagree with your opinion, I disagree with the way you present it
There are many arguments for and against monarchy, that is not a good one

Cool illustration, but it's a bit misleading not to include massively religious countries like  Romania, Cyprus, Greece, Croatia, Serbia, Malta and more that I probably forget
This would look very different if the balcans were included
Good fucking riddance
Can't wait to see this be the norm where I live
It's probably a good long while away though
Same with Greece and many other Balkan countries
Seems like they left out a lot of predominately Christian countries to skew the results
It doesn't include and other countries like Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Croatia, Serbia, Malta etc
Countries that are religious
I'm glad they left us out
It's kind of embarassing
At first I thought the same too, but then I noticed that they had included Russia which is Orthodox
But I'm talking about the rest of the country
86% are orthodox christians, 50% attend religious services at least monthly, 95% believe in God

Im considering doing my bachelors in Scotland .Does anybody know if the tuition fees  will remain free after Brexit ?
Universities, public or not, have their own golden boys as well
It would be interesting if the tax records of the last decade, of all the higher ranking officers in those unis went public
Then we would know where all this money goes
And just to mention here that the  £9
250 is only for a Bachelor degree
A Master costs average  £7
392 per year (unlike undergraduate degrees, masters aren’t subject to a fee cap ), and it is so common nowadays that it is the norm, not the exception
Of course, a master is paid everywhere, but in the EU depending on the country it can be between zero to  €2000 per year

Αντε ρε μαλακα
γαμώτο is as mild as you get with vulgar greek expressions mate, you couldve done much worse
In Greece we say Γαμωτο/Gamoto but we also use the Turkish one, Siktir
We also use siktir in Greek although it is pronounced sichtiri
At last a map I can relate to, since I used "Γαμώτο" and plenty of its variations about a dozen times today
We also use siktir here .
Ώπα ρε, από την Τουρκία είναι το Άϊ σιχτίρ που λένε οι γιαγιάδες;
Γαμωτο is more a "damn it"
Γαμω means "fuck" so i think it's more accurate in the way it's used
Γαμώτο in Greece
LOL
Greek one's also fine
It directly translates to "fuck" (Where, more like "fuck this", but the way it's used is basically the same as "fuck")

I mean in Greece a water bottle costs 0,50€ literally everywhere, even in airports
Worst thing is that airports force you to dispose of your water bottles before check-in
I had to read most of the comment section trying to figure out if the "only 1€" reaction was sarcastic or genuine before I realized how expensive is water in some countries
Where I am the typical price is 0,5€ if you buy it from a kiosk or something like 0,15-020€ if you buy it from a super-market
As a Greek 1€ for a bottle of water seems kinda insane
I'm almost willing to bet that in popular airports, the water bottles they make you dispose of bring a really significant bit of profit
Its interesting the aviation industry to say least
Its hotter in france than italy Greece and Spain
You good
Can we switch the heat toggle off ?
Eh 30 degrees is manageable, it's not that bad
Actually these are kinda the normal September temps for Greece
Fun fact 30 is the opposite of a heat wave in Greek september
Tbh, that's not a heatwave, that's rookie temperatures
Greece is in the red and 30C is bread and butter for us, we have 30+C every day at summer
Greece: I should carry a jacket with me it's starting to get cold
I mean
it doesn't. Obviously climate change is real, but this map doesn't prove anything
Yeah, the average was 28
9, basically 29C for warmest temperature of the day in September, according to the link that you sent me
This map displays the warmest temperatures
So today it got 1C warmer than the average
Oh, what a *terrible* heatwave /s.
[Here it is from an other source as well]
In the summer months, it gets warmer than 30C *every* day with like 1 or 2 exceptions for thr whole summer
I have been living in Athens my whole life pal
I noticed that the source that you sent me is norwegian
Is it possible that you have lived there for so long that you forget how warm summer in Greece gets

Hi there
To answer your question, I'd have to write a book
We are very big on food here and Greek cuisine is comprised of many extremely tasty local cuisines
If you avoid the touristic places (I do not mean the touristic destinations, but rather the touristic restaurants), you'll get to experience what Greek food is all about
There is a website which gradually draws the gastronomic map of Greece
It's far from complete, but you may find some interesting info [there]
Some of my personal best, based on my experience so far (there are tons of places around Greece I haven't visited yet):
- Lesvos island: It's one of the biggest producing areas of olive oil in Greece, it has a varied and extremely tasty cuisine based on local ingredients and it is also the home of ouzo
I have had some of the best and freshest fish dishes here (the island is famed for its sardines), I lost count of the local ouzo brands (there are also a couple of ouzo museums on the island) and one should definitely not fail to taste its (protective destination designated) ladotyri cheese
- Crete: Another great olive oil producing island, home to one of the most famous local cuisines (Cretan)
One shouldn't miss apaki (smoked fine pork cut seasoned with herbs), dacos salad (the tomatoes of the island are some of the most fragrant and sweetest ones), fresh local greens, hohlioi boubouristoi (pan fried snails with rosemary), goat dishes, the vinegar-y sausages and the local mini pies
The island also produces some interesting wines based on Kotsifali (local grape variety) and tons of raki
- Tinos island: The past few years Tinos has been making itself a name as a gastronomic destination
I love its artichoke dishes, its cold cuts (louza is to die for), the local cheeses and the fried tomato balls
- Volos: I'd go to this mainland port city for its tsipouro tradition (they serve tsipouro with an array of delicious small dishes - meat and fish - at low prices)
If I were interested in wine, I'd probably choose between Nemea region in Peloponnese (home to the Agiorgitiko local variety), Naoussa region in central Macedonia (home to Xinomavro local variety and host to numerous wineries which one can visit), Santorini, Samos and Lemnos islands (all three islands also have a delicious cuisine based on local ingredients, besides producing some of the most famous Greek wines)
The whole Peloponnese region is very intriguing on food terms, while Athens and Thessaloniki cities have a great restaurant scene
Crete, Volos, Thessaloniki for food, and eat everything
A trip to Dortmund costed 10 euros last week

My man just wanted to post something beautiful
You too my Sweden Friend
I sincerely hope our neighbours will vote for a secularist and Erdogan will be ousted
We could improve relations with Turkey and provocations should stop
Best wishes

Out of the loop
What's happening
Good luck
Hello
As a concerned neighbour, what is the opposition's stance on Greece
Some Greek outlets had reported that Erdogan was attacked by the op for being too soft on Greece
Is that true
Well the crowd is massive and i wish you the best in your campaign
I really want for our leaderships to get along and Erdogan does nothing but creating tensions
Tbh
there's nothing i want more than to see both of us working and chilling together, i mean fck the arms race let's enjoy each other for once
I think he is even worse than Erdogan regarding Greece
It's a lose lose situation for us
How about we give an islet in the ~~Ionian~~ Aegean and they^^gib ^^East ^^Thrake
Disputed territories means two countries claim the same land/sea, what do you mean by exchange
I mean more broadly like Japan/China or Vietnam/China territories
Which is why I wanted a citizen's opinion
Only once had I heard that Greece was not being discussed in Turkish politics at the given moment by a greek reporter in Turkey
Kemalists are douchebags
My flair should show why
Or India-China, or Tibet-China, or China-China2 (Taiwan)
China has no friends, does she
We still call it ''Mikra Asia'' in Greek, meaning Asia Minor
I say we should take Nikomedia as well while we're at it
For many decades it was a vassal for many actors and countries and that's not good on a subconscious of a big power, I get that they aren't fancy friends
There is a feeling of threat
Even as recently as the 1970s with the invasion of Cyprus, people fear Turkey
Many Greeks have relatives who only came to Greece due to Kemal's actions
I remember my visit in Istanbul many years ago and, in particular, the welcoming climate
The more heartbreaking part is the tendecy of association between government and people
I'm all in for secularization but damn it kinda gets personal when so many civilians died in Smyrna
On the upside tho, most of them were educated and actually contributed to Greece greatly
Countries included:
* English-speaking
* Countries they want to invade and occupy
Pff
That's ridiculously beautiful

What is it with Greeks hating everything
You can't force people to be attracted to something they're not for the sake of being politically correct
Same in Greece
We even have African celebrities (athletes) who speak fluent Greek
Some were even born here and have Greek names
In Greece we do not renovate the roads but when we do we just patch some holes to become bigger in the next thunderstorm

WTF i hate the Eu now
what really pisses me off is that those who voted against the article belong to the neo nazi party we have here in greece and 1 or 2 are leftists
i expected from the conservatives in greece to vote yes because these people have 0 dignity and only exist to ruin things but i didnt expect it from the center left
im disappointed
Are the Greens any less "let's do nothing that would even remotely risk our economy" than the CDU when it comes to dealing with Russia and Turkey
And this means
So the chancellor is going to be from the green party
Basically, Germany is governed like South Korea, by the big companies which are also corrupt as Φuck
Like Siemens and her black funds, for instance
Germany's selection of refugees is strict
They probably handpicked families
Plus the stance has changed
After the arson of the Lesvos camp Germany agreed to accept 1200 refugees out of 15k. Handpicked
Nice !
Yeah but how will that affect politics in Germany
Here is more random facts for you, i guess i was wrong about the exact numbers mea culpa

I think I fell in love with a word
They hate  cause they aint
Most of Greece's debt isn't in Euros, it was almost 100% of GDP before Greece adopted the euro and it only skyrocketed because the economy contracted by 30% when no one wanted to work with Greece because of Tsipras and Papandreou
Not having the Euro actually would have worked in this case
Yea with Papandreou, Simitis, Papandreou (the son) and Karamanlis but all of Pasok (the party that basically died) which ruled for \~ 30/40 years went to Syriza
A brief explanation is that the Simitis government cooked the books with currency swaps changing the real debt so Eurostat was brought in by the EU to take over and they are still there today
Then ND is elected and they with Eurostat used the bailout funds to buy military equipment from France and Germany
Then Papandreou (the son) said ND was lying too with the military equipment which wouldn't have mattered so much to the EU since they basically made the sale happen but Papandreou wouldn't agree to bailout terms creating the mass loss of trust for Greece
That is what caused the economy to contract so much, the loss of trust hurt more than anything else for Greece
So Pasok fails to reach a deal so ND comes back accepting the terms and the economy improves a bit then Syriza comes in and fucks everything up but eventually doing everything ND was doing anyway
The whole issue is basically partisan politics, it is like with the Macedonian name dispute
ND in the 90's had literally the same deal that Tsipras made with N.M. but in the 90's ND got unelected for being "traitors" according to Pasok
Then the economic crisis happens, almost all of Pasok dies and goes to Syriza and then Tsipras make the same name deal with N.M. When the Simitis government was caught cooking the books for a decade using currency swaps, there were actually MP's from Pasok saying N.D. were traitors and stupid for telling the world about how Greece and Goldman Sachs were ripping everyone off for almost 30 years
All just so ND could get votes
Ironically in Greek politics, the left side is just as xenophobic as the right side as Pasok and Syriza both hate or ridicule Germany, the UK, France, the US etc while the centre-right side only cares about money and would sell everything out
Oh no
As I saw this map, some very warm wind hit my face
It's kinsa ominous tbh
Help
Send help
So far here in Greece lower temperatures than normal in end july with 33 to 35
Help
You should add Cyprus, looks good otherwise
I can assure you Greece is not that cheerful

I just sat here trying to point out every country on the map like an idiot
The comment isn't underrated
Turkey's location and shape would probably make them Mordor (it has the roughly same rectangular shape)
Plus they're many and angry :P
Guess we should start lighting the beacons
Great job OP, it looks neat
So does that mean that Greece is Gondor
I think it would match the siege of Vienna more, with the Rohirrim matching the Hussars charge that broke the siege and all
Damn, i deserve some self-flaggelation
I totally read that as Minas Tirith lol
You're right, it was a good analogy with Minas Ithil
As if this is the only '"rewriting" in the history of history (pun intended)
As a matter of fact this is not even the worse

Is this where all the anime MCs keep their bikes
And here in Greece we wear jackets in that kind of weather
Summer hits us hard at 40 degrees and I generally don't have money for air conditioning
Too bad 90% of the population lives in cities a couple of hours  away from any of the amazing islands
Goddammit
*Laughs in Greek*
You aren't in western/southern Europe though :)
There have been quite a lot of maps in /r/europe about the divisions of Europe, but I'd say Western Europe is Spain at the very least
I'm sure it's easily proven that it isn't :)
Sweden should start saying it's swidiss and Switzerland should be sweesh
It tough here in Greece
Keep in mind, some taxes are payed through utility bills (ex
the electricity bill), I don't quite remember what the tax's name is
6%? Wow
I need to connect myself to reality again
I'm not in touch with almost anyone who's struggling financially **that** much and apparently that alters my point of view
Oh boy
holy fuck
Yay
first time i see my country at the top of a list
Yay we are first
hold up
Here in Greece 37% is homeless (I think) that explains it
When I saw Greece being #1 I was certain that it was about something negative
That being said these are 2018 stats and the situation has supposedly improved
Of course we’re first
Living costs compared to UK with salaries compared to Bulgaria
Welcome to Greece
Great here's something we're first at :)
We won
I want to thank Germany for helping us achieve this great goal
Greece is high because we are to lazy to go pay them
At least you guys get one of the two /s
Nah we probably shouldn't
Almost all of them live in Athens that's why
At least we have money for German tanks
Our small family business is taxed similarly at around 50% here in Greece but it's definitely not worth it
All of the downsides with none of the benefits
Edit: to clarify, income tax is not 50%. But adding up all taxes and the various government fees we pay throughout the year it does add up to around 50-56%.
I learned something new today
Thanks
Balkans stronk
I think pensioners have it the hardest
Most have had their pension cut multiple times in the past 10 years (and it will probably happen again)
Old people who don't have a family to take care of them must have it real hard
Young people have it bad too, but they manage better because they have low expectations
Example: no one expects to buy a house these days
Many boomers can't adapt to their reduced income, they're used to having a good economy
Generally unemployment has gone down quite a bit because we have seen a rise in service jobs: baristas, food delivery, etc
But you can't make a family on these jobs
For me, as I studied computer science, there is a lot of work in my field
Once I'm done with my army service I expect to get an entry level programming job
Starting salaries aren't anything special, but it's usually enough to live on your own
My mom is kind of like that
She could be more well off by 1) not smoking, which costs at least 100€/month and 2) not having so many pets/spending so much on her pets (also at least 100€/month)
Her income is okay for a pensioner in Greece and she owns the house she lives in, you'd think she would be good to go
Instead she is struggling with bills and is slowly but surely taking on credit card debt (very smart, I know)
Now 200-250€ might seem like a joke, but when you live on the line it makes a big difference
People of that generation didn't have to be so careful with money, so they find it hard to learn to do it in their 50s/60s.
People in Greece are more well off than our neighbours, but poor compared to the rest of the EU
I'd say we are on a similar level to Romania
I ride my bike everywhere, drink cheap beers in cheep bars and don't go to clubs or fancy places
I pirate a lot
Eat at home
A good day is when friends gather, we buy some good meat, cook and drink beer
Starting a family is doable, just not easy
You can't be frivolous with your euros
It really depends on your perspective
I have travelled in the Balkans and have seen that things could be much worse than they are now
The part that stings is that it used to be good, and it went bad recently
There is a persistent and pervasive cultural norm of tax evasion, favoritism, having 'backup' off-the-record money, knowing the right people in the state, and so on
This probably stems from the time of the Ottomans or even earlier
And it developed because people had to lookout extra for themselves and their families, keep some 'backup', bribe some Ottoman officials, etc
This mindset never faded, as we were pulled into modernity by western powers, instead of naturally evolving in it
We never had a Renaissance
We are at a point now where it's like a prisoners dilemma in game theory
If no one plays, we all win
But people are individually highly incentivized to 'play' and thus it's very difficult to stop
To be honest I think the only way to truly change is to have a heavily controlling totalitarian state
But that would take us waay back economically anyway so it is pointless
This is true for most Balkan countries, not just Greece, by the way
I truly believe this is the most important factor that explains why we are as we are now
We still have an outdated mindset that works to undermine the state
The rest I'm too bored to answer ;)
Yeah, Europa-girl is a fucking weeb
For fuck’s sake, is this where we’ve ended up
I mean Europe has been depicted as a woman since her inception and origin
I think Cyprus really earned this one

This wasn't the Ottoman empire we're talking about
By the same standards I can hate the Germans because they killed my great-grandfathers, but I don't. The simple Turkish people did nothing wrong
You should hate their governments not the citizens
Don't get me wrong though, I understand your notion, but /r/place is supposed to be above politics
Did they not vote for them
I know nothing about the prelude
It's okay
You can always vote for another
Mythos beers everywhere
Edit: I never claimed it's a good beer, everyone calm down
To each one what they like
For some reason this post made me really sad
Imagine how much food is wasted worldwide
This is only some food from only one supermarket
Imagine how much food is wasted from every supermarket in the EU
Wait you got mythos beer there too
is that a mythos ? in poland
Mythos beers are way better than the others
Nai auto na doume sth roumania pou eixa paei eixe is grhgorh
Except for Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan
But like
why tho
The problem here is that you cannot easily transport the food from where it is discarded to where it is needed
There is a big cost involved, made bigger by the lack of infrastracture in the areas where starving is commonplace, which those needing the food obviously cannot pay, and by the time it arrives most of it will have completely rotten away anyway
People do not starve because food is wasted, they starve because food cannot get there
That's pretty good
You got it right for Ancient Greek
This is Modern Greek so the pronunciation is a bit different:
Otan to diafimize "pantou iparhi enas mithos" ke mis to koroidevame
Their old (current
) motto is "There is a Mythos (myth) everywhere
And they had ads with some people drinking Mythos in different countries
Good question, it's a bit tricky but not impossible
I'd say the most evidence we get is from how the Romans heard and wrote down Greek words: for example, they wrote "Athenai" for "Αθῆναι" (Athens), but in mod
Greek that'd be pronounced "Athine" . This means that "η" was pronounced as "e" (in fact, a long "e") instead of "i", and that "αι" was actually the diphthong "ai" instead of an "e". Now this is just one example, but you get the idea: do this with thousands of Greek loanwords to Latin, as well as to other languages, or even with words Greek borrowed from Latin, Persian, Sanskrit etc
After comparing them, you have a pretty concise idea of what anc
Greek sounded like
But there's more evidence, for example some authors have described how things were pronounced, and we even know some anc
Greek onomatopoeic words: in one of Cratinus' plays, he writes that sheep sound like "βῆ βῆ" or "vi vi" in mod
Greek
Not gonna lie, "vi vi" is the stupidest sound a sheep could make
It would make much more sense if it were pronuced as "bē bē" like in most languages of the world, and in fact it is
Or if you're not convinced just think about this:
Why would the anc
Greeks create the first alphabet in the world and instead of having 1 letter per 1 sound they had 7 combinations (ι, η, υ, ει, οι, υι, ῃ) that all sounded like "i" according to mod
Greek pronunciation
Well, because each letter indeed corresponded to 1 sound (mostly)
In fact, mod
Greek pronunciation is not really close to anc
Greek, because it has undergone several sound changes
Keep in mind that 2500 have passed since then (if we're talking about Attic Greek)
English pronunciation has changed much more in 1000 years than Greek did in 2500
But sound changes are a natural part of every language
Some Greeks have trouble understanding this, and it's even become a political game: if you go to Greece and start talking anc
Greek the way it actually sounded like, people will start laughing at you and probably call you names
In fact, we're not even taught in school it was pronounced in a way other than like mod
Greek
I only learned this when I was 16 by randomly browsing Wikipedia
If you wanna read more, [Wikipedia] is a good place to start
And [here's a video] of what we think anc
Greek most likely sounded like
If you have any more questions, just ask :)
Just like you dig out ruins every time you try to build anything in Greece, I bet in 2000 years they will dig out bicycles in the Netherlands
You can consider yourself lucky
I'd wish so but i cant :/
That's sad :(
>No wonder the greeks are so much in debt, not knowing the difference between infront and behind, probably thinking a minus in front of your financial balance records means it's positive instead of negative
Ehhh that would mean that we don't know the difference between plus and minus, not in front and behind
Just sayin
Thanks for the rest of the comment though :P

Greece is about 22-26
That could mean a country has many small schools
There are
small villages in islands in greece with 3 children
I think the maximum you can have in Greece legally is 27
My guess is that in smaller villages (which we have a lot of) there are very small classrooms which would offset the ~25-member classrooms I’ve also experienced in cities, giving that ~17 average
I’m from Heraklion (Crete) and lived there till I was 14, and I also remember classes always being over 25 kids, closing in (and even reaching) 30 at times
This average was indeed surprising

Hey you guys, we're doing good on the right list for a change
Damn, that white male privilege is really working out great
The gap between women and men is way too big
Women need to step up their game
Finally a national score I can contribute to
I don't understand how those two are connected in your mind
You can have "white male privilege" or just "male privilege" and still commit suicide
Lithuania's been trying it's best too
This is simultaneously very funny and a bit insulting
(Like all good jokes should be)

I edited the post and now this looks like it's out of context/mean, no need to downvote
Then you can't have toxic masculinity and make privilege together
But it's not
It's politicians that jumped on the "5000 sUiCidEs eVeRY dAy " train , letting people to believe that it's true
Countries the used to be part of the Soviet union tend towards higher rates based on that map
Might be political, or might be cultural, or it is a coincidence
I don't even like Trump but damn if it's not enjoyable watching him own Merkel, Macron and the other EU snakes
looks like the little kid in "Asterix and the Spaniards" that always threatened to hold his breath
I like the fact that there is a road leading out of the EU and it is to the water
can confirm
upvotes from the oceanfloor
> The Greeks got themselves in that situation by not paying taxes
Greek here
Taxes are the tip of the iceberg
We borrowed MUCH MUCH more than our GDP allowed
When we entered the eurozone, we got a bond interest rate close to that of Germany
Result: we borrowed shitloads of money
Then the time came, to pay back
> they would have been much worse off without the EU, yet all they do is complain about austerity politics
sadly true
people think that austerity is a choice, and that you can get a "good" leader who will say NO to austerity and magically the economy will spring back up, and all benefits will be restored
The myth of the moneytree that grows money: this is the current understanding of most Greeks with respect to the economy
uff, here we go again with the armchair economist one line explainers
Lmao, if you think not paying taxes creates a deficit of that scale and not bad financial decisions by the govt
The problem with Greece and EU in general is that the periphery cant compete with Germany
So Germany exports a crap ton and keeps the surplus for itself
When people realise this it will be the end of EU
Exactly, with a public debt and your own currency, you're biggest debtor is your own people, similar to Japan or the US
Not foreign banks
Yeah man, I'm Greek and work in Brussels, that shit is so funny to watch
Venezuela had a massive oil economy that collapsed that Venezuela was highly dependent on
EU is a european common market
Germany is a big country and big market in the center of Europe in a very rich and fertile land
Greece is a medium sized mountainous country in the periphery of Europe
Its very hard for Greek products to compete to German ones
Its hard to compete even domestically
There is no taxation of German products like with american products lets say so theyre almost cheaper than Greek ones and this is hurting Greek factories
If you go to a greek supermarket you wont find irish finnish or portuguese products but theres a crap ton of German ones
This results in unemployment and a lot of other issues
Then theres the defence budget
Germany is surrounded by EU countries and switzerland and spend 1% for defence budget
Eastern Europe has to deal with Russia and south east with Turkey and middle east
If EU was like USA these things wouldnt be a problem but in EU every country is looking for its own interests
This guy explains it very well in 6 min
Now regarding capitalism
In capitalism you have economic crisis all the time
What will you say when Italy or some other country collapses and EU does nothing to fix it
Will you blame lazy and greedy Italians that dare to ask for help
Im sure you will and thats why EU will collapse
I know that what is true
Oversimplifications and comfortable 2 line rhetorics from people who have no expertise or insider angle
No, I do not "know it's true" and I do not appreciate anyone running their mouth or keyboards like they know everything

We eat a lot of potatoes so I wouldn't say so on our part at least
Ah yes, the great race wars between the potato people and the tomato people

Why not both

I don't know about pickpocketing but do me a favour, google crime rate by country in the EU
Then act surprised when Greece is lower than Sweden, Germany, Ireland, UK, France, Denmark etc
In the past I've even heard americans say they were hesitant to visit cuz this country is dangerous, needless to say they have like 9 times our homicide rate per capita, LMAO

Great job, this is great, but RIP our islanders tho :(
Love how you used the old greek flag
You're a madman
This map is really cute:)
Feel free to move here Scottish bros
Just bring some whiskey
in greece we have tsiknopempti
Its the day for meat consumption basically
We have the same in Greece, it's called "Have-a-bite Thursday"! We have big barbecues instead of eating sweets and eat a ton of meat
Is there a "__ Thursday" in other countries too
Some fellow Greek please tell them something about today in Greece
Who would have thought that neighboring countries share culinary items
Meanwhile here in Greece and Turkey people are fighting to the death about who invented what
Be careful Europe, you're playing a dangerous game

That Greece has a +12 in the economic situation proves how meaningless this whole chart is
Cause you know though we may believe that our government can handle the economy better than the EU, according to this chart, but it doesn't mean we believe that they are good at managing it anyway
&#x200B;
But
that +32 on Military Defence, also being the highest number on the list, is very telling
Between a rock and a hard place
I would prefer having a 'I don't trust any government' option
You would see a different map
Greeks trusting the EU even less than Finland on military defence is kind of funny to me
Only Greeks get to complain about their government and financial, social situation etc
If someone else implies a negative aspect we grab the pitchforks and torches
TL;DR: A surprising amount
In Greece we still have the "Occupation" syndrome (Katohiko)
People hamstering food and never leaving anything on their plate
Also comes in the form of "forced" eating and excessive food prep
Mostly prominent within grandparents; it is something that was transferred to the next generations as well
Remnant of ww2 and the nazi occupation
My late grandmother used to tell me all kinds of stories about those dark times
It formed our current mindset and attitude as a nation and is still subconsciously affecting our lives
And knowing the way history tends to repeat itself, I'm a bit worried about the years to come and especially about water
Everyone thought that the twin Greece - Cyprus was exaggerating when asking for sanctions
Guess its only serious when important coutries take some of the heat too
*Slaps roof of Germany*
This country fits some many nein
Oh NOW we want to sanction Turkey Europe
ahh yes . History repeats itself once again
I dont have a problem if its an important EU country,the thing that did it for me was when everyone was fighting for sanctions on Belarus, a non-EU country, and no one gave a shit about what we are facing
Germany and some others ain't gonna ditch their interests in Turkey because we have a standoff with the Turks
Sanctioning Belarus was an easy thing to do because they had nothing to lose
Now that the problem is at their doorstop they will have to do something
I hope  this time they will go all out and not pamper Turkey again as they did in the last summit
Well to be fair, although I always bought French products, France should think about moving the factories it has in some muslim countries and afterwards we can talk about supporting this notion in an organized fashion
It's kinda idiotic to support the employees that boycott you
No, i dont think i will
I might end up buying the new Renault Megane after all
No I agree
I have a Citroen Saxo and I mean
it's kind of a shitty small cheap car compared to most other cars (it's my first car though, I got it when I was in uni so gimme a break) but I gotta say the damn thing is sturdy and pretty reliable
It has served me well

Greece is doing fine like hell tertiary in thrace
Didn't expect that
Don't fool yourselves from geography, Greece's five biggest cities are in blue areas
And we are a super urbanized country, so that's around 80% of population
I expected this result, in Greece university is like the only way forward, we are a heavily based white collar country
Let me fill the rest for you (joking):
Albania: red and some yellow
Serbia: yellow and a tiny bit of blue
Bosnia and Herzegovina: yellow
Moldova: Yellow
Belarus: Red and yellow
Ukraine: Yellow, red and just a tiny bit of blue
Russia: Yellow, red and just a tiny bit of blue
Why not
They have two university towns
Also Crete, I surely didn't expect that
If you are only saying this because of this post (i hope you don't) let me say that quantity =/= quality
Σαν Αθηναίος δεν ήξερα πού και άλλα μέρη της Ελλάδας εκτός από Θεσσαλονίκη είχαν καλή εκπαίδευση λολ
Σαν Αθηναίος που είσαι, πάλι καλά να λέμε που ξέρεις και τη Θεσσαλονίκη
Κοίτα η αλήθεια να λέγεται, τα σοβαρά πανεπιστήμια είναι Αθήνα/Θεσσαλονική με εξαίρεση κάποιες σχολές, πχ το Βιολογικό της Κρήτης είναι το καλύτερο από ότι έχω ακούσει.
Τώρα άσε τους άλλους να λένε ότι το πανεπιστήμειο της Ξάνθης ή του Αιγαίου είναι όσο καλό όσο τα ΕΚΠΑ/ΕΜΠ/ΑΠΘ
Παρόλα αυτά, πτυχίο παίρνεις από όλα, οπότε μετράει.
Η υπόλοιπη Ελλάδα είναι irrelevant
Το πανεπιστήμιο Κρήτης ξεπερνάει όλα της υπόλοιπης Ελλάδας στον δείκτη THE, ο οποίος μετράει τις επιδόσεις με βάση τις δημοσιεύσεις που βγάζει το πανεπιστήμιο κάθε χρόνο. Και γενικά η αλήθεια να λέγεται, το επίπεδο της εκπαίδευσης που έχουμε, δεν υπάρχει ιδιαίτερα στο ΕΚΠΑ/ΑΠΘ, τουλάχιστον από ότι έχω ακούσει.

**Cries in Greek**
For Greece,
With adsl if i sit on the dslam I will get ~20 down ~1 up at ~19 euro for just the internet
With vdsl* you will get ~50 down ~5 up for 30-35 euro and you get obligatory minutes on your land-line to justify the price
Then we got ftth* at 100 up - 10 down or 200 up 20 down for, get this 40-50 euro and 50-60 euro with a bunch of land line minutes that you of course won't care about but they have to justify the bullshit price
These are the prices from the 3 big telecoms giants that control everything and have a monopoly
* is because you need to be lucky to have access to vdsl and ftth and even when you have ftth the 3 big telecom companies won't give you the same upload/download on Fucking fiber to the home
Then there are 2 small companies that (thank the flying spaghetti monster) started putting their own fiber network for ftth in my city and area
One of then whom I use started out at 28 euro per month, with no contract, toy can stop any month you want for 100mbit up/down upgrades to 200 if you sign a contract for 2 years no extra charge
Then we have the government giving you a 13 euro per month payment for 2 years if you do use a ftth connection as part of the modernisation of the internet in the country but of course the small guy with the best prices who first put ftth in Greece in my city doesn't get in this program
It's only for the big 3 who took ages to put some fucking fiber on the ground
I am sure the situation with the monopolies holding the aging networks and charging big time for it, is similar for a lot you guys aswell
I pay 10 times that for 10 times less good internet
37€ 100/10Mbps here
There are companies providing 120/120Mbps for as low as 25€ and 1/1Gbps for as high as 360€ but the coverage is minimal
TIL that due to EU regulations, EU eggs are about 50 times less likely to contain pathogens such as salmonella than American eggs

I thought it was a practice pursued by the industry for the sake of better visual appearance of eggs
Jeez, that's fucked up
Is there any other way to boil an egg
Yes, actually
It isn't actually a big deal at all
You tell me it's trending or why people have lost their shit over this

Parthenhenge is full of tourists this period
Give them back or we will send our top politicians to 'fix' your economy

Both Albion and Britain are Greek words I think, right
Alvion was the original name used by Greeks and then around 1st Century AD Greeks used Prettania which then became the Roman word
And lets not forget the word kimono

If we went to speak instead of read/write, Spain would be way less than 85%. They think that speaking at the English level that Greek kids can speak at age 13 is actually adequate
Cheating in what way
It's very hard to find a job in Greece without knowing at the very least English
I'd say that number is about right for us
How are we cheating
Kids take English* at school and go to the evening English private schools (φροντιστήρια)
We also don't dub movies-series and we rely heavily on tourism where English is used almost always
*There are also French and German lessons while Spanish is on the rise

I'm surprised about Greece tbh
do you are have stupid
Erdogan knows how to deal with such situations
The bin where Erdogan sends EU's strongly worded letters
I believe that it is obvious that by “EU” we mean “countries in the European Union” and we condemn the fact that they (Germany,Spain,Italy) put fiscal gains over an idea and an institution that they created, the European Union
A Union for fucks sake
We should be united behind a common cause
Yet, when Greece and Cyprus agreed on sanctioning Russia our intrests were hurt
About the migrants part
Total BS
If Erdo unleashes the migrants there a 100% change that these will go only to Greece and nowhere else
So don't tell me that Germany and others are actually carrying about us and they don't want us to be overwhelmed with migrants
I fail to see the part where France sells off fellow EU members

Can we stop topping the wrong lists
Thanks
Finally
We are first at something
Greece with 48
0 celcius: I see no God other than me
i hAte EverYthIng
Me as a greek: what's that heatwave everyone is talking about
finally something we are the best at
Suffering from success
And to make it worse in the Greek article linked below it says that for 8 days the temperature didn't drop below 30° even during nighttime
Edit: Small correction, the above info from the article is about the 1987 heatwave that peaked at 44° not the 1977 one that peaked at 48°.
But this was in '77 in Athens, it was because Athens back then especially was a big cement block of a city with horrible transportation system, tons of cars that burned leaded fuel , smog and no trees what so ever
So it was  the perfect environment for horrific smog and heatwaves .This days the situation is way better
Yeah but mostly because people are unprepared, there's ways to cope even in those temps

I dare not ask if this is real
Thanks, I hate it
Holy fuck, that's depressing
looks like a doom level
>I think that if you want to support european independance
The point isn't to support European independence far as I can tell, it's just stop anti-competitive/monopoly-like practices from Google
Seems strange it only happened 30 years ago
Interesting to see that fyrom uses same language as the rest of the Slavs, but NO they are not Slavs
Greece, forever alone
Hope you guys pull a Greece before it's too late
UK has no free speech
No free speech = No free thought
People are being arrested by literal thought police
UK is a totalitarian state on par with China
German engineering at it's finest
Boston says hi
You will never surpass us Greeks in bus submarine technology go cry with your panzerkampfwagen's. Lol
Greece should be 500 (because thats how much most people get)
Means nothing without taking taxation into account
Now compare suicide rates
Or the Thessaloniki metro for us Greeks haha

Do they watch it dubbed or subbed
I know Germany is a big dubbing country, but you lose so much nuance here when you dub over the actors' original voices/accents
You don't have the option of German subtitles on Netflix
I would say artistic integrity and maintaining the fullness of the performance, but you already said your sister and parents don't care \*shrugs\*
Megali Idea and Kurdistan live
In which year did Dutch mountaineers first reach the summit
Can you post the video
Lol
You are right
They are an ethnoreligious people , they are an ethnicity and a religion, but definitely not a race
I agree with you, but I think they said that because some Americans (a minority) get mad when someone is wearing braids and for some reason they think that it's wrong, but I think it's wrong to judge all Americans based on them, since these people don't represent the majority of Americans
I think because some people believe that some of you think that it's wrong when a white person is wearing braids
But obviously that's not representative of the majority of Americans
Lol , I and many others said that I disagree with this generalization and that doesn't represent the majority of Americans
I just tried to explain why op might have thought that, btw they wrote on another comment that it was a joke
I think people said that because they have seen people being accused for things like this
[ harmless-or-racist/
&#x200B;
Anyway I disagree with that (and every kind of) generalization and I think that it's unfair to label and generalize nations/races/ethnicities etc
That's why US won the cold war
I thought the same thing when I saw that
Well it said almost nowhere and there is a map that shows the temperature of each country
I thought that they said "Murica" before I read your comment
The opposition doesn't seem to be much better, based on what I read  have authoritarian, they don't have any desire for transparency and they are pro-Russia
It;s not bad to have a good relationship with Russian people, but Russian government is authoritarian and enemy of freedom and human rights
That's based on what I read by some sites and some montengrin people like this
*"My significant other is Montenegrin and follows the politics there every day
She says the same thing
The bulk of the opposition is not progressive or really pro-democratic
They are conservative, lean towards Serbia and the Serbian-Orthodox church, and are not motivated by a desire for transparency, but rather by a tribal sense of Slav unity
That means they want to get closer to Russia than say Germany or the UK
Not everyone in the opposition is like this, but the majority are
&#x200B;
*" Opposition is divided in that manner
The 2nd biggest and the biggest opposition party is leaning more toward Russian than toward the EU
The other 2 are for the EU
*That is something very much unimportant
You cannot have 'ideas' reasoned in a country where the only political voice you're able to hear is Milo's one
*Referendum for important questions and new elections after they destroy the DPS(Milo's party) is inevitable
I might be wrong though
They say  that many people inside the "For the Future of Montenegro" are pro russian and supported by the Serbian church
Fortunately there are people ho are democratic and supporters of freedom in that alliance
Putin has put people in jail because they protested against him
That's sad, I hope the Poles win and manage to take their right back
I hope we as EU can build a better relationship with USA now
It didn't solve them, but many people weren't using cars and public transports as much as before lockdowns, so that was good for the environment
Yeah,  I am progressive and I don't really like that "antifa" rapper because he glorified extreme forms of violence in his songs,  but ( I am saying this to avoid any misunderstanding) I believe that the fascist murderers were worse and his murder was clearly wrong
And I also support this post and I believe that we should remember it in order to remember that fascists and neo-Nazis are scums
edit: Guys I am also against fascism, I am not sure why my comment was downvoted
This song is gross and disgusting,  but him being a shitty person, doesn't mean that he deserved to be killed
Edit: Never mind,  I read that you just don't consider him a proper anti-fascist, which makes sense, but you do not support his murder either
Nazis are extremely rare here, just like KKK is extremely rare in USA
I think that Roupakias who was the murderer of Fyssas was founded guilty last year
Yeah,  that's why we have states and authorities, so random people who are mostly neo-nazis don't decide to just kill someone because they founded him guilty
I have 100 Mbps for around 35 € per month and 200 Mbps cost around 50€ , unlimited calls are included in those programs
Congratulations . I am not a German , but I am  a fellow European
United in diversity
They were charged for their crimes nor for their ideology
Lend me some money and I will teach you how
They can just use the pronoun "they" when the gender isn't specified
He just wants excuses so he can stay at home
It makes sense when you annex and oppress someone to be unfriendly
Also Russian government is authoritarian and oppressive
Me too
Germany is a very nice place
That's awesome
I am very supportive towards people who fight for basic human rights and freedom
Isn't it a constituent country
I prefer ketchup or Mayo ( or both)  with hotdogs
Usually I put ketchup or mayo and ketchup
So maybe we can design  it all flat and then add some hills, mountains etc
But most of it would be flat
Grave in Greek is "tafos"
Βασικά ειπες ταφφο με 2 φ.
I agree
But to be fair the results are specifically for roads with holes, not generally for roads in rural areas
For example there are roads in rural ares that they are okay  [
Really
I didn't expect that , mostly because of what I have read from other Nordics
I didn't know that
But I searched it and you are right
And many of them ( at least most that I have seen until now, but I have seen only a few comments) are actually Greeks and I even seen a post about it on a greek circle and they also spoke about debts(but about the aegean's debt, which is a different case)
Thank you neighbor
Thank you , muych love to Germany as well
Thank you komsu
That seems very nice
That's very weird
The security guard of Benjamin Netanyahu  did not even recognize the PM of NL
Also they should have been more informed about him
Congratulation guys, I think that was good for you
We have German friends that lend us money
They are leaving for university . Also there you are getting some money for renting when you are a student
Also someone said that this post isn't accurate and this is what is happening in Sweden : [Sweden: Young adults move away from home at 21 or - in the boys' case - almost 22 years of age
I think that's uncommon
Most people want to leave from their houses as early as they can
At least that the case in the most big cities that the majority of the population is living
Also many people are leaving to study in universities outside of their towns/cities
I think so
In comparison with Nordic countries we have  low [minimum wages] and [average wages] PPP  . Also [We have the highest unemployment rate in EU]  and the [second highest youth unemployment rate after Spain] . But fortunately after 2015 the unemployment is slowly being reduced, so I guess the things will be better in the future
Thank you mate, I wish the best for you as well
At least my region ( Attica)  is blue
I doubt that it will be bluer than Attica
Why do you say that
It was clearly a joke lol
Congrats
Keep fighting for your rights
I hope that you win but you are already winners in our hearts for doing that
Yeah, I should have phrased it better, I meant generally for the right of Polish people and especially women in this case
That's awesome
Congratulations to the mayor
I believe that the government or the authorities may protect a right but they don't give it
For example they don't give you life,liberty,bodily autonomy etc They just have laws that protect your life and your freedom etc
That's right
But that's what natural freedom means, the things that you are able to do based on your nature
&#x200B;
>The bounds of your life are defined not only by your natural limitations (which for us humans are quite restrictive already), but by the limitations imposed upon us by everyone else
I think that freedom should have limitations that would protect it and ensure it
The freedom of one person should stop where the freedom of another person begins
&#x200B;
>up to and including ones where if we violate them, the government will kill us
I agree that the government can put legal restrictions  on freedom (btw the law is a social construct) (or the opposite) . But that doesn't mean that they can give you freedom
It means that they can either protect or restrict your freedom
Okay but our gdp per capita was also increased very much from 2000 to 2008
( and it's higher from 1980)
The thing is that we also had a lot of debts, mostly  because of corruption as you said
But I think we have the potential to improve both economically and socially
>"pseudoWest" country,
I think the term West doesn't necessarily refer to economy
It can be about the position of a country during the cold war, and culturally The phrase "the West" is often spoken in reference to the Western world, which includes the European Union (also the EFTA countries), the Americas, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and (in part) South Africa .
Yes, but our debt has also increased
We don't know if the same applies for Romania
If all the other factors remained the same or became better , then we can conclude that Romania is in a better place today (in comparison with their past)

That's really beautiful
That was horrible
Fuck nazis and fuck people who support and  promote such ideas through propaganda and those that they radicalize  people
>we’re not going to change our laws for a terrorist
(Something not related with the subject) But don't you mean they, since the discussion is for another country
Okay then,  that's right
Our metro/subway is also partially funded by EU
Thank you EU for that
Is there any sign to the metro/subway cause I can't remember , even thought I took it last week
I know that's funded by EU , but I don't remember if there is a sign there
Yeah, that's right
At least they are democratic countries now,  except Russia I guess
You are right
I haven't noticed Belarus
I agree
How is BH south***eastern*** but Slovakia and Hungary central
BH is geographically more western, but for some reason this map counts is as more eastern
Another example: How is Denmark Northern Europe but Baltics Central Europe ? Latvia and Estonia are more northern than Denmark and Lithuania is as Northern as Denmark, they should have been Northern Europe
I am wondering what were the criteria for putting each country into a specific region
Οk  But still there are some issues , for example Estonia is more "culturally northern" than central European
(Also it's kinda weird to use geographical terms to describe cultural regions, without specifing that you are using them like that and based on so and so criteria
Bte why did you write Scottish & British in your flair
Isn't Scottish included in the British
I get it now
So if I learn Norwegian I would be able to understand all Scandinavian languages
A free, tolerant and democratic society needs laws and policies that protect their freedom, tolerance and democracy from various threats ,in order to remain free, tolerant and democratic and to keep progressing
Nice, I hope they achieve it
I think in Greece Trikala is a very nice place for that and of course you can find many places in every big city
That's not exactly accurate
In September the normal weather for Greece is around 23
5°C
Above 30 is the warmest that it gets in summer months , but not the average or the normal that it's everyday
>In the summer months, it gets warmer than 30C
>every
>day with like 1 or 2 exceptions for thr whole summer
I have been living in Athens my whole life pal
I think that it gets 30+ usually after mid July, before then I think that the temperature isn't as hot, for example June is less warm that August
Also according to your source t mean temperature between June and August is 24 at June, 29 at July and August, but the highest average temperature was above 30
So, I guess that means that this is the usually hottest temperature during those months and not the everyday temperature
>Yeah, the average was 28
9, basically 29C for warmest temperature of the day in September, according to the link that you sent me
>This map displays the warmest temperatures
So today it got 1C warmer than the average
Oh, what a *terrible* heatwave /s.
You are right then
I maybe misunderstood you, because  thought that you were speaking about general average temperatures, but yeah if we are talking about warmest temperatures, then it's only a little bit higher
&#x200B;
P.S I don't live in Norway
I understand you dude
I am Greek university student and I want to visit Germany
It is very beautiful
Germany has a lot of pretty landscapes
Some Americans think that Belgium is a city, others think that it is Bulgaria
I wonder if they do it on purpose to trigger Belgians
Very nice job op
There are places in Finland that are hotter than my town
I didn't expect that
Tbh I also think that around 15 C is fine, especially for this period
Happy republic day

You seem like a nice friend
Of course it is, I understand you
transgender people were granted the right to change their legal gender without having to undergo surgical alteration of their genitals in order to have key identity documents changed
This can be done from 15 years of age ( but with parental consent I think since the person is a minor)
Since 2005, discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace has been prohibited
It depends what do you mean by poverty
In Greece most people have a place live and they can afford eating , clothing etc
There are some ~35k people however who are homeless, so that's how poverty looks like for the most poor people
There are others who have lost their jobs and have trouble to pay all of their expenses on time and others who can afford all the basic things and can't afford something more like holidays, buying new phone often etc
edit: Also I think that for one person the minimum wage is enough for housing and utilities in medium to poor neighborhoods
But it's hard to maintain a household with a family
At least we have free healthcare and education
Do you have to pay for university there
We would be the employee who is asking for loans from other employees .
Yes
I was taught British English, I have watched some British movies and TV shows, but I watched many movies and TV shows in American English
I think most Europeans, except British and Irish, use words from Both languages
Many times when I see someone saying stuff like "How y'all doing" or "Howdy" I think of them as Americans from the South
But some of them, aren't from the US South, they just like these words or the US Southern culture in general
Maybe they meant cunt
Yeah, I am aware that this doesn't apply to everyone from the south of America
I just think that most people who use these words/phrased are usually from the southern states of America
Okay, thank you for pointing it out
BTW your username "deuteros" means second in Greek
But there is also a videogame with that name
Hopefully they are minority
Unfortunately they (neonazis) still exist
Here the name Nikolas ( or Nikos)  is widely used .
And the AfD thinks that refugees are going to commit crimes and destroy Germany
I agree
That's why I prefer fried potatoes on pizza
Yeah and it has nice taste
It sounds tasty .
BTW Is that it [ ?
Yeah I agree
BTW how is the situation , regarding this issue, in United States of America
I think it's good , what Europe does
The only thing that puzzles me is the future of Europeans who do such jobs ( coal related etc) , but I guess this issue will be solved until 2050
That refugees are criminals who have iphones  and money and they want to take over out country
That we are poor
I guess as  a European country that's true,  but worldwide we are above the middle
Unfortunately we have it,  but I haven't heard about him since a long time ago
Same thing here and the Muslims are barely 5% .
Btw the weird thing about anti-EU sentiment is that think that eu turns Europe into a Nazi empire and from the other hand they consider that it has a extreme left wing agenda
That made me chuckled lol
Btw the weird thing about anti-EU sentiment is that think that eu turns Europe into a Nazi empire and from the other hand they consider that it has a extreme left wing agenda
I wasn't even aware that there was an anti-Norwegian barnevernet movement in Europe .
I understand the more of it but no the first part ( I think it's a Greek expression, but I can't remember it)
Can you it write in Greek so I can sure it
Ααα οκ τώρα το κατάλαβα. Btw ο πολυέλαιος μεταφράζεται chandelier
>The fun part is that, my age group (35)
I am like 15 years younger than you and I am perfectly adapted to this situation,  I think the people who are less adapted are the people who are old as you said but younger than 70 maybe, because as you said young people are more comfortable with technology etc and  old people are used to stay at home
Yeah I have seen such ads
The last time we got real snow , in my area,  I was six years of age
Yes,  I still live in Greece
May I learn the reason you ask
It depends
In southern Greece it rarely snows, but in some regions of northern Greece it happens more often
For example Northern Florina
>As a kid I also thought tiramisù was a Finnish invention
When I was a very young kid, I though that the word tiramisu was Greek, but then I learn that it was Italian
I drink tap water most of the time, but when I am outside  and I really need to drink water, the I buy bottled water
I think, at least in my town, that it’s safe to drink tap water
But I think it’s not so good on the islands
May I ask where do you live
I live in a town in Attica and most people here drink water without filter and I think it’s healthy and safe
Maybe it depends on the region/city/town
There are trans people today and it is legal to change your gender today in Greece
Also I think that kids in some countries like USA ( I think) can't just change their gender, they are seen by therapists to check if they actually have gender dysphoria or something like that
But even there there LGBT community doesn't have a single opinion , they aren't a monolithic organization
You can change it at 17 with the consent of the parents  or at 18 without anything .
Tbh I haven't heard a Greek lgbt person advocating for 3 year old trans kids, even many americans pro-lgbt disagree with it online
Who are you
But some words aren't used or they have changed and have different form
It's kinda hard and probably unlikely to fully understand the Homeric Greek without studying it
But generally I agree
I think that in my country you are obliged to be vaccinated in order to go to school
So I think that vaccination is in a way mandatory in my country
I would like if there was a EU law for that cause a lot of people of other EU countries go to my country as tourists and to others countries, so I think that it would be safest for all
(for example babies who aren't vaccinated yet)
In some movies and tv shows sometimes the subtitles aren't accurate and there are some mistakes
For example :
Boyfriend  -> friend
Analogy -> observation
Practical -> Technical
Relief -> happiness
Trust -> believe
Where I live the weather today is 23-31 C .
What are the political disagreements with your follow countrymen
>And if someone from outside of Europe asks me, I usually say that I'm German, because I'm sick and tired of talking about Kangaroos, Koalas and Australian Rule Football or whatever this is
Lol I kinda laughed with this
The form of government of Greece is that of a parliamentary republic
Popular sovereignty is the foundation of government
All powers derive from the People and exist for the People and the Nation; they shall be exercised as specified by the Constitution
BTW I am Greek and I haven't heard that the situation is so bad before
But it makes sense because of negative effects of lignite
Ούτε και εγώ.
The irony is that EU was created to prevent wars and situations like that
So they want to kill white people by uniting them
That sounds crazy
True
The good thing is that I have only see such crazy things online
Some people are very delusional , to the point that they may need professional help
Nice anime
Personally I make a circle (ο)and then i write the ι α.
Third time is a charm .
Luxembourg,Finland,Italy,Spain,Greece
Yeah
BTW You also have beautiful places that I would like to visit
I have family there and it is nice
BTW I would love to go to your country, it seems very nice and you have a good quality of life
Are you sure about that
I would like to live there, the only problem is that maybe some people may believe in some stereotypes about where I come from
It depends on lot of factors like wind, hydration etc
But I guess at around 15C°, but sometimes higher
Right now it's like close to 19 C° here and I am fine going out with a T-SHIRT
But as I said earlier this might change if it's very windy outside
Also it depends if I go somewhere close or not
Btw I haven't wear a jacket since many months ago
. I think below 25-20 °C is low for the summer only, but in January ,for example, it would be warm , because usually it's way below that
That's mostly for Athens (  ) mountainous places have kinda different weather, especially in winter they are colder
European countries (included my country)  ,European Union,  Some specific type of buildings and architecture
I have voted one time on each election ( National, European, Regional, Municipal)  and I voted for the party that I was closest ideologically and has a chance to enter the parliament and I preferred for each case, even though I may had some disagreements
Based on what I read 37% of Greeks are smokers
and 27% are daily smokers
[ )
Personally I do not smoke because I do not like it and as someone else said   it is very widely regarded as unhealthy and stinky .

Are you sure about that
Based on what I read 37% of Greeks are smokers
and 27% are daily smokers
&#x200B;
Also  it is  widely regarded as unhealthy and stinky .
I agree
The same is true for the people I interact
All smokers that I know  smoke only on specific occasions
I think the numbers of smokers in the last few years are lower, because as you said it is regarded as unhealthy and stinky
This was from 2017 actually .
*Thirty-seven percent of Greeks are smokers*
But unfortunately we are still the first in EU
I think that research from the WHO took place in 2016
But still we are in a bad place and we need to improve and progress .
Do you know the reason(s) that many people from many countries call you Holland
That's true ,even though the official name is βασίλειο των κάτω χορών , kingdom of Netherlands
BTW personally I didn't have a problem calling them Netherlands in English,  because that's the most common name that is used in English
You are right
Also, Cyrillic is as different with Greek alphabet as Latin
There are some letters in common,  but there are also many different letters
~~Btw shouldn't you have used Κυριακή aka Sunday cause the feeling happens on Sunday
edited
Ah ok I just thought it would be more specific if you use Sunday, but it makes sense that way
An English guy who calls football "soccer".
You should take a DNA test
I assume that by fries you mean French fries
At least do you like souvlaki ,gyros and buttfucking
hahaha Which Balkan countries did it show
BTW did you know or did it come as a surprise for you
I like fried potatoes very much,  they are good in some places here
But if fried potatoes are so good in Belgium then I have to go there to try them
In modern times I would say that it was the years before the economic crisis cause we had the highest gpd per capita increase and in general the highest gps (per capita)  in our history, lower unemployment,  we were ( and I think still are)  in a good place in life expectancy
People who think that you are still nazis are hypocrites or just dumb or just extremely uninformed and out of touch with reality
Based on most comments,  all European languages are very  hard to learn,  or at least that's what their native speakers think
Bte at least for Greek,  it's  not so hard as people are saying  , with right practise and dedication someone can speak very well,  there is a Belgian guy who speaks Greek like native
US too because they were among the first nations that recognized us
They even named a town after us for this reason
I am also thankful that you supported us ( the Allies) against the Axis during WW2 .
Congratulations
I like discussing with people on this sub
It's my favorite subreddit about Europe and one of my favorite subreddits generally
I especially like the fact that most people are tolerant and open minded
Keep up the good work
Greece
We had many wars/conflicts with them and our people are constantly fighting with each other
But seriously it depends ho you ask, because some people may like some people that other perceive them as rivals
You mean us
Our people are constantly fighting with each other
lol
I don't plan to move to another country,  but if I did I would choose Luxembourg
It has friendly people, high quality of life, good salaries,  open minded society without extreme right wing parties in it's parliament
Also I would like to move to USA because in some professions it's one of the countries with highest salaries, and I also like it for other reasons
I am not sure if this counts as a child story though
It depends on many factors such as the age of the person and the environment that they are in
Also when people, especially young people, are going to parties clubs,bars etc many people are drinking in order to have fun and to enjoy the feeling of drunkenness, not to the point that they can't walk, but to the point that they experience a feeling of euphoria . Also some people might want to combine alcohol like wine with their meals
But generally people here like alcohol

Some people kike to drink in order to experience a feeling of joy or euphoria
They do not necessarily won't to get drunk to the point they can barely walk

(Since some Germans are speaking about Swiss German) I can understand Cypriot Greek when I read it, but not when I hear it
Lol
Funnily , linguists think that there was a proto Indo-European language that was the root of all European languages,  but no European can understand it,  except the linguists who are researching it ( maybe)
I agree with you  it's very important to keep it that way, to build a free, democratic, social, united, and peaceful Europe
It's truly fascinating what you guys achieved
We also have KFC here in Greece, that's an advancement, I guess
I think that would be better in all aspects, because until now the history has proven that the societies are evolving and developing with ups and downs of course ( based on quality of life, wars, mortality ate, goods that a person is able to buy, engineering, technology, medicine and generally scientific discoveries etc)
So , I guess it would be more economically developed more united and peaceful the political climate will be better
About culture I don't know, but I guess it would be more adjusted to the needs of the time
Finally I have now clue about demographics, but I guess the change won't be very big
We, as humans, have also created smartphones, internet, vr , more developed artificial intelligence etc
Btw how do Finnish people feel about Russia
(I am asking since you are both from Finland and Russia
That's true, but I think that almost half of English words have Latin/Romance root
That's a good idea
(BTW I think that the cross ins't only a religion symbol , it has also another use ,it was also the symbol of the Greek seafarers because it symbolized the four points of the horizon
But since it has a religious meaning I agree, because we are a republic which believes in freedom
Also historically we had other religions before Christianity
Then should we have symbols of the ancient religious traditions, since they are also history
EDIT : Also orthodox church was AGAINST the revolution for the Greek independence
We can put an Epsilon of  ancient Greek style
Καλή ιδέα και αυτό!
And the Olympic games, the theater, battles about freedom from Persian empire happened because of ancient Greek religion ( or at least that was the excuse), so we should also honor that religion and have such a symbol in our flag
&#x200B;
Anyway back to what you said
Revolutionists  used some religions or theistic phrases to spread the messages for revolution , because most people were influenced by religion and the church was hostile towards revolution, so they wad to do that in order to make them fight and not get influenced by the official religious institutes .
. But religion was also used by official institutes against the revolution and against the Greek nation
"Είμαι χριστιανός, ως εκ τούτου δεν δύναμαι να είμαι Έλλην." Γεννάδιος Σχολάριος.
That means I am christian and therefore I can't be Greek
: «είναι θέλημα Θεού η Πόλη να τουρκέψει» That means it is the will of god for the city to be Turkish and it was said by the orthodox patriarch
&#x200B;
Also the orthodox church was **AGAINST** the revolution for the Greek independence, so based on your logic we should not honor that church and it's dogmas
&#x200B;
So religion was used both in support ( mainly as way to convince religious people, but I guess the same would have happened even if we had another religion as it did happen before Christianity) and  against the revolution but the official religious institutes such as the Orthodox Church was against the revolution
**EDIT:** Just to be clear, I am not against Christians, only against specific religious institutions and radical and extremely religious people and alt-rights and extreme conservatives
Also I don't like that some priests said that covid isn't transmitted through the spoon in the holy communion
>it
I personally think it blends in very well in a design with lines and generally it remains discrete and nice
We can put an ancient Greek epsilon or another symbol that represents Greece as a whole
But I think that ancient Greek epsilon would fit fine
I would also like to thank Italy for the amazing food,culture,history,architecture, for your beautiful country and for being nice and friendly
Thank you Netherlands for your support
Wow that's a very well written and wholesome answer
So thank you Denmark for Lego, for having a well organized and beautiful country and for insulin
Thank you Serbia
It's truly great that we are allies and support each other
Thank you also for having a beautiful country
Only before sleep
Anyway the doors can't open from the outside, but it's  safer to lock them
Who needs a garage when you have a living room
Wait, so can someone just enter into your house uninvited
I didn't know that
Do you have the types of door that can be opened from the outside
I live in southern suburbs of Athens
It is nice here
Because I can go to the center relatively fast by car or with public transport ( 25 mins) and I can enjoy beautiful neoclassical buildings and nice ancient monuments and all the benefits of a big city
Also in the southern suburbs there are  mountains and there also many beaches . Also it is relatively relaxing and quiet  and there isn't a big density, so I can enjoy my personal space when I wait for bus without being squeezed
EDIt : Also Attica is the most economically advanced region of Greece
I agree
I live there and it's nice
There are lot of thins all the pros of a big city plus I am close to the sea and to the mountain at the same time
I doubt that Athens is uglier than all the other cities
It has beautiful neoclassical buildings and nice ancient monuments
Also in the southern suburbs there mountains and there also many beaches
BTW I live in southern suburbs
Edit: Also Attica is the most economic advanced region of Greece
Here she is also teaching English,  but I don't remember her nationality/ethnicity
I guess I didn't pay attention to it when I was like 5 or 6 and maybe they didn't mention it

BTW about your previous question " Do you guys expect Americans to be white or black or are Hispanics more familiar now
I think that someone can be black or white while also being Latino
Personally I have American friends and they are white, so I think Americans as White , but also as Black and occasionally as Asians ( just for the fact that there are less Asian Americans)
When I think of Latinos, sometimes I think them as non-Americans like Mexican, Cuban etc citizens and sometimes I might think of the as USA citizens, I guess it depends on the occasion and on the Latino person
But if he is a white nationalist why are there black people who support him
For example Candace Owens , politicians like senators, etc
I am not trying to argue with you, I am just curious
Kinda yeah , from movies and such
But also some movies and some public figures of USA portray them as immigrants so sometimes I have this image in my mind , but I know that's not always the case and many of them are legit American citizens
About their culture I know that they mostly speak Spanish and secondary Portuguese (mostly Brazilians) , they are family oriented,  I know they are generally hard-working and I know some foods and music of theirs
But generally I don't know very much about them
BTW That's just my impression some of these things might be inaccurate
I think that these people viewed as foreigners the latin Americans that  immigrated now to the country and they wanted to stop illegal immigration and illegal immigrants etc , but I think that they didn't have something specifically against them as an ethnic group, they said that it was only due to legal reasons
But I have also seen one video of someone who said that US was a nation of white people and other racist bs
I hope that he was a troll and he didn't mean all the racist things that he said, but unfortunately racism exist in all countries ( to some extent)
The name souvlaki
Northern Greeks call souvlaki what the Southern Greeks call kalamaki (the  type of meat that’s on the stick) , but Southern Greeks call souvlaki the combination of pita(some type of bread) meat, sauce, fries or whatever someone puts in it
The word patat sounds like the Greek word patata which means potato , I think both of them come from the Spanish word patata and that is maybe loan word from a native language
The problem with pitogyro is that some people put chicken or other kinds of meat instead of gyro , but this word describe only the pita that it is wrapped with gyro, but  the word souvlaki as used in the Southern Greece is more generic and covers all cases
Here there is also the word geomilo which means potato, but literally means earth apple, but most people just use the word patata
Things like airplanes( I think they are already to some extent), train and rail systems and ships who travel throughout Europe
I guess if other countries want a EU army like a military alliance would be good
I would also want the EU court to take action against violation of human rights
Also it would be nice to set better infrastructure and education standards since EU is funding countries for that purpose
edit: Also it would be good to extend the EU health insurance card for something like common health insurance for the whole EU
Or maybe something like USA but adjusted for EU  .
There would be some federal laws that will apply everywhere and will be above national laws but there would also be national laws
Do you know why is that happening
But there are differences here
For example there are stereotypes and expressions for villagers such as άντε ρε βλαχε villagers have stereotypes about city people . There are also differences in work life, life style ,infrastructures etc
How many of us love drinking milk
I love drinking milk
I like milk more than beer or wine
I wish that there were milk bars
I am wondering ...how many of you love drinking milk
EDIT : I didn't mean milk bars as we say cereal bars , I meant bars that sell milk instead of alcohol
EDIT 2 : See this videoit contains information ,at some point, on how to start drinking milk, if you are lactose intolerant( if you are not, I do not see any reason to do what he suggests)
Yes, it counts
It's okay
Nobody is perfect
>I had a serious problem growing up but now I'm more of an occasional drinker
I am a heavy drinker lol
>makes you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence
yeah, since it makes you strong
Yea it is soothing and refreshing
BTW I also prefer whole milk
>But I love anything made out of milk, cream, butter, cheese, yogurt
Hmm
That's something
Maybe we will accept you to milk lovers club
I can totally relate to that
Yeahh
It is so nice and refreshing
Do they have so good milk
Maybe I should try it one day
I also haven't broke a bone
I just found out there is a sub for this
lol
Yeah
Milk Gang
I also prefer milk or chocolate milk over coffee !!
Maybe you should check it
I guess, I will come to you
I think the process of moving there is very easy because of EU, but I  guess I will struggle a little bit with the language
I didn't mean milk bars as we say cereal bars , I meant bars that sell milk instead of alcohol
Maybe I have to edit it , to make it clear
What did just write
I can't read it
Unhomogenised milk is better
Pure milk is awesome
May you be healthier soon
I wish you to be able to enjoy milk again !
At least you understand some of it's benefits
That's a good point
BTW Blin is Russian pancake , right
Yeah it is also very good with donuts and croissants
I also love drinking cold milk, it is so refreshing
But I tend to use warm to hot milk, when I  am ill or when I have a headache
In many European countries is very common to drink milk
How about America
How do you feel about this thread and all these Europeans (including me) who like drinking milk
BTW Can you elaborate on why you feel nauseous
I agreI agree with that
I prefer to drink real milk small farms
Yeah
But I have to make it clear that this idea is copyrighted .
It is protected under the Greek and European law about copyrights
lol
I agree with you
They are the two best and most useful drinks
That's an awesome record
Cold milk with cookies is a great combination
You do well !!! Milk is better than soda
Welcome to club
Well, I am hydrated
Milk keeps me hydrated
But I also drink plenty of water
I agree with this
I also prefer fresh milk
That's nice
Stay strong
Haha it makes sense
Btw I am kinda surprises that someone found this thread after so long
We also don't drink sterilized milk very often
Whole milk is the best
I guess that's something
I also like drinking chocolate milk
I also like drinking it with cacao
Why do you believe that it is not very healthy
What place was that
It has to be a real nice place
Cheese is great
I like to eat milk with cereals for breakfast
We are many
Yeah !!! Milk for life
Yea it is blessed
Maybe you should edit that comment or they will see you
The Greek word for milk is γάλα - gala ( g is pronounced as y or as wh from what)
Cold milk is just so refreshing
Give me milk or give me death
lol
Can you tell me some of these meals
( I am interested)
BTW How is life in Japan
Do they accept European people ( or generally non Asians) easily
I like goat milk, but I usually drink cow's milk , cause that's more common
The milk that isn't low fat or skim milk is called whole milk
That sounds awesome
Yeah usually, in less urbanized areas you can buy milk directly from producers and it is going to be more fresh /cheap and flavorful
I think in my cities they have installed some kind of milk machines in corporation that they have fresh milk directly from cows, at least that's what they claim
I added a clarification and I left the initial text
haha . lol
OK , I just thought that it may not be common to drink milk in the place you live, based on your response, but now I understand that's a personal thing about you
So as I understand, you mostly hate the idea of milk and not the milk itself
It may be a little complicated if you are unfamiliar but it gets easier once you engage with it and become familiar
IF you need something tell me, but I guess you can easily find a Greek in Australia
I can't see the image
>third time in July
I have also been in Tolo, but not this year
What were the other times you being there
It is definitively common
But I think cow milk is more common, but I am not sure, because it may differs from town to town or between cities and rural areas
Ok, I think that full fat milk or sweet milk is generally better
I actually just read their sure again and they are writing " fresh milk, from the farms if Thessaloniki and Macedonia directly to your glass "
So maybe they process it, I am not 100 % sure based on what they are saying
EDIT : I also just read the following
The raising of the cows by the member farms of THES gala Cooperative is done with tender loving care, utilization of modern equipment and efficient management systems
Nearly all of our feeds are Greek products cultivated though contract farming under the guidance and supervision of agronomists, and with respect for the environment
Milk gathering is performed in a shed using milking machines in an environment that is clean, protected and ideal for safeguarding the quality of the milk
The milk is stored, cooled and stirred in stainless steel refrigerated tanks, that are washed and disinfected daily to secure the milk’s purity and freshness
Cow milk is common and goat milk is also common
In my family we drink mostly cow milk
I think goat milk is more common in rural areas
But you can easily find both anywhere in Greece
What about USA
BTW In which State do you live
Thank you
But I have to ask why do you think that
I hope that you had a nice experience here ;)
One day I would also like to visit your country :)
I mostly drink it cold
But if I am ill or if I have a headache or a stomachache , then I drink it very warm
But since we all like the good white stuff, we are good
I live in southern suburbs of Athens
Thank you
I also have respect for Australians because you managed to build a great country even though they initially sent convicted criminals to your land, you did a great job and you managed to make it a very nice country to live
Do you know why this happened
I agree
Something else that I would add is coca-cola and jeep
You should have replied in Finnish lol
If you live near the borders or in a small country ,then it is relatively common
Schengen countries  abolished all passport and all other types of border control at their mutual borders
An image about Schengen and EU countries  [
But i guess that generally for most people  isn't very common, like something that you do very often or on a regular basis
For people who can't read Greek,  these names are Christos and Christina,  but because Christ in Greek is Christos,  the name Christos is written with η instead of an I.
Okay
Please excuse my English
What about Germany
I think it's also some common  history that we have , that makes us have good relationship
What about  Sweeden
We love you too
Una faccia una razza
I sometimes read about EU, for example new EU laws and regulations, so I guess that I do to some degree
We have 40 parties but  only 6 of them are in the parliament
In the last national elections  the parties that entered the parliament were
A center right  party (New Democracy) that  took 39
A leftist party(Syriza) that took 31
53%
A social democrat party (Movement of Change) that  took 8
10%
A communist party (Communist Party of Greece)  that took 5
3%,
A far right  party (Greek solution) that took 3
And another leftist party ( Mera25 - Diem 25) that took 3,44%.
The rest of the parties didn't manage to get over 3% to enter the parliament and they got 8
07% together
&#x200B;
The results of the last nationals elections
&#x200B;
list of Greek political parties
Yeah, I just wrote the official names of the parties
The movement of change is a party that creates when pasok and some other minor parties decided to unite
I added the Greek name of Diem25 which is Mera25 and it might be more known to Greeks
But yeah it's the party of Varoufakis
Yeah, you are right,  both of these things are actually true
First name + last name,
Sometimes someone might have 2 first names
Most of the times last name is taken from the father , but I know some people who took it from their mother
EDIT: Some people have 2 last names
I wasn't really aware of that,  sorry for not mentioning it
I will add it
Yeah that's right , but I just mean that it's not the majority
Yes, but it's not compulsory
In my school it was kinda fun because my religious teacher was progressive  and open minded , and there were a lot of debates during the class , usually between kids and the teachers
I usually got good grades in that subject
Also as someone else said .   is 2/3 Christianity and 1/3 other religions, of which we skip a lot and basically just talk very briefly about Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism, probably making many wrong assumptions about them in the process .
Personally the thing that I mostly dislike is that this subject  wasn't very objective, because it gave too much emphasis on Christianity
It would be better if  it gave the same emphasis on every religion
BTW is it compulsory there
Here if someone want can choose not to attend it
i know a lot of people who just did this
I thought that you had catholic schools there, but I guess they are exempted from that law , because they are private schools,  right
When I went to high school they also taught about other religions too
But I agree with you t , because the class is biased towards Christianity and it gives more emphasis on it , but at least it is not compulsory
Also , in my school it was done better, because my teacher was open-minded , so she didn't force religion on anybody, she did have debates with kids etc
When I went to high school they also taught about other religions too
But I agree with you t , because the class is biased towards Christianity and it gives more emphasis on it , but at least it is not compulsory
Also , in my school it was done better, because my teacher was open-minded , so she didn't force religion on anybody, she did have debates with kids etc
Luckily our teacher was more progressive and open-minded
This teacher sound very regressive and close-minded
That sounds  like propaganda
I guess Thessaloniki, because it's the second biggest city  but it's far too north or Patra because it's the third  biggest city and it's a nice city and it would also be nice to boost it it up .
But right now Athens is the best choice , because Athens ( not the municipality of Athens , the boarder  area\_)is the richest are of Greece and it has the most businesses, cultural activities like theaters  also sports ,music festivals and  technological businesses etc and is   the city with most population and it is easily accessible from al the mainland Greece
So maybe I would choose Thessaloniki because it's the second more important city or Patra since it's closer to Athens and it is the third biggest city
I am not sure if there are other good options
Based
By the same logic I would choose  Luxembourg city or  Berlin
They are really good at running a country
I agree with you
BTW I like your username
I agree with this
Here around 50% of import/export is also done with EU countries
Do you also have waiting times
I have read from  a guy from America ( if I recall correctly) that said that a big downside of public healthcare is waiting time and some European countries that have public health care have waiting times and it’s good that we don’t have that here etc . Except if he meant that there the waiting time there is short or that someone has to wait even for urgent cases
Yeah  I also believe that waiting times are different in different countries
They are also different even between different hospitals in the same region
I think that it has to do with the availability of doctors, nurses , rooms , number of appointments etc
Was it because your history teacher didn't teach you enough of it or because you didn't study enough of it
I would say New Years Eve cause all people  are cheering, they celebrate and they gather to eat , drink and have fun, outside there are fireworks and the atmosphere is generally cheerful
>(this may differ from house to house)
That's true, my family and my friends don't go to church cause we aren't really religious
Edit: wording
I think that's because the other orthodox churches follow the old calendar, but the Greek orthodox church doesn't.
The majority of people that  I know don't fast , but I agree that it is usually celebrated on 25th
I saw someone that posted this [ and I think that it may be kinda accurate, so I will add other two types [
and this [
&#x200B;
I guess that fit the stereotypical image, especially of some rural areas
But I should note that in Greece there people with different skin tones, hair types, hair tones and shades etc
Also there are many types of facial features
So I   doubt that I recognised a Greek just by their facial features
For example there are Greek's that have blue eyes and blond hair ,brown eyes,  with light skin with dark skin,  people that have small lips, big lips etc
Also most people don't dress like these photos
I think that I know almost all US states and I can point some of them at the map
I also know some stereotypes about the mannerisms of each place ( like southern hospitality, that the people in NY or NYC are blunt, lol I am not sure if that counts as knowledge , but I learnt that from New Yorkers)  some jokes about them (like florida man, alabama jokes) some local cultural  stuff like southern rock, Gumbo from Louisiana . I know some very basic things about the climate of the US regions
I personally have family friends from USA and I also sometimes speak with Americans online (like here on reddit)
I think that states are far more know than counties or provinces or regions in European countries like the one you mentioned , because US states have a bigger degree of autonomy (about policies, laws, taxation etc), US states are more powerful and richer that the average region in an average region of a European country ( for example California would be one of the richest countries if it was a sovereign state) and many of them have the size of a country
So I think that because of that reasons they gain some popularity separately from the USA
( I am not sure if I expressed that properly, I hope you know what I mean)   .But I think that biggest reason that many people know the some us states is the media and the news
However most people know only the most famous states (like New York, Alaska, Hawaii, California, Florida, Texas)
I believe that the fame of each state has to do with media exposure and maybe with their economy , because a state with a good economy will attract more people and businesses , so more people are going to know it and I guess there other factors that may contribute to their fame
Also I would like to  emphasize  that this knowledge is mostly superficial, for example most people don't know  who is their governor of these states or where they are on the map or their capital etc
or their state laws ( except if is someone really likes a state , for example I know someone who wants to move in New York and this person knows it's governor and other facts about it)
Also many people know the big cities of USA, like NYC, Las Vegas, Los Angeles etc
Not a completely different, but I guess it counts
Γιατί = why
Για τι = for what
for example
Γιατί μάχεσαι; = Why are you fighting
Για τι μάχεσαι; = What are you fighting for
Γιατί είσαι εδώ = Why are you here
Για τι είσαι εδώ = What are you here for
Yes I am
But sometimes I am thinking about going to  USA
>Our passport is ranked 4th
Same here, our passport is also ranked fourth
I guess that's partly because of EU or schengen
So do you consider to go to live somewhere outside of EU like a french-speaking are of Switzerland or you jut want to leave from EU
Well, there are still countries with different currencies
Personally I don't miss it, because I never experienced it
I get that
But still even if you didn't see benefits from EU, wouldn't they see some negative things if they leave like some meds that are imported from EU would be more expensive ?
That applies for Greek too
BTW The gender of the word city is also feminine in Greek
How do you speak German as Swiss
Also are also Swiss German generally the same or there important differences between every canton's local dialect ?
BTW I think that this show is also very good for adults
I think most people prefer euro over drachma
Usually I call the by their name but sometimes use words like bro , friend, boy (agori/agorina) , sometimes malakas but it's also considered an inappropriate and is mainly used with friends , also it might be used as an insult, but it depends on how it is being used
It can be considered as an insult like stupid or something, other times it can mean a mastrubator and it can be used  as way to refer to someone , mainly between friends
Generally it depends on the context
Also people avoid using it in people who aren't their close friends, cause it isn't considered appropriate
The most common one is friend (φίλε)
That's true
BTW I think that today most kids "believe" to the modern version of santa klaus who brings gifts  and he is overweight, with red clothes, white beard etc
In the building that I live people who pay rent,  pay around 600 € per month for an apartment , but I guess that's still cheap in comparison with other European cities
I think it’s not common but I support it and I really like Europe day, but I recently found it out
There are flags in some public buildings like city halls for example
And some people care
I would recommend you The Orge of Athens (1956) .  In Greek it is called the Dragon,  ο Δράκος.
I also like very much a movie called five more minutes
5 λεπτά ακόμα,  (2006)
I also liked the movie An (2012) and Worlds apart (2015)
It's a nice movie and it is also thought provoking,  but it might be bizarre and weird for some people
I would like her to be more progressive and more supportive of lgbtq , but I think she has done a good job in Germany, based on the current situation of Germany
No problem, I understand
That it is a phonemic language
You know how a word sounds,  by just reading it,  even if you have never heard of it, with very few exceptions
Usually yes,except if you are very close to them  and they let you do it ( like for example the house of you grandparents that you visit very often) or if they have given you the permission to do it
Not my parents, but I have communicated with my father in English when we were close to an old relative and we wanted to say something personal, but this person doesn’t hear very well, so maybe they didn’t understand that we were speaking in another language
I like mochaccino, even though I usually don't drink coffee
Btw do you talk with her about political issues like the current events or you are avoiding such controversial topics
I think that since you are both atheists thing are fine,  because I have the impression ( correct me if I am wrong)  like some differences ( like gender roles , religious customs etc)  that they have and we don't have exist due to Islam and (Erdogan), but I think that's mostly true for far eastern rural parts of Turkey
Also in most cities people in both countries are secular despite their religion
In addition to that I guess that the stereotypes that we have for each othet, which in most cases are false,  will be less dominant in a third country
Yeah,  I meant that those are the usually stereotypes for muslim nations
But I don't believe in such stereotypes,  and I believe that many people in Turkey are secular,  despite that these days due to Hagia Sofia we mostly see the more extremist and religious people
>Oh
We don't believe in gender roles either
I'm the one who usually cooks (I love cooking)
That's nice I also like to cook occasionally
Here we don't use terms like millenials and baby boomers
There are people who talk about younger and older people, but generations aren't a big thing here and we don't categorize them as Americans do
BTW what do you think about that
Εντάξει όμως δεν χρησιμοποιείται πολύ συχνά και έτσι όπως χρησιμοποιούνται οι γενιές στην Αμερική. Επιπλέον δεν υπάρχει στενή κατηγοριοποίηση των γενιών. πχ η γενιά του πολυτεχνείου ανέφερες δεν είναι επίσημος όρος. Στην Αμερική έχουν επίσημου όρους για κάθε γενιά.
I think that with people  close to you like close  family members  it is not a problem
But generally I think it might be kinda rude or inelegant if you ask someone about their wage/salary
But in some situations it might be okay
I think yes but it depends on the age, I think that after elementary school kids walk alone to school , but also many kids walk alone before that, I guess it depends on the family and on the area
I think that Estonia is very good combination of a  secular and sober country
Even though they are not famous for being sober, but it's true
It has a photo of the person who owns the ID,  their name, their last name,  the first and last names of their parents,  date of birth,  place of birth,  the municipal that they live,  it also has height but it's empty in my ID
Also it write some other stuff like the authority which gave the ID , the ID number and the signature of the owner of the ID
In addition to that,  there is a new ID which is kinda different like more advanced, but I don't know a lot about it
The Erasmus Program is a  student exchange program between between European countries  ( mostly countries from European Union but there are other countries too like Iceland and UK)
It's easier than Hungarian , but few people who aren't from Greece speaking it and few people would dedicate time to learn it, just to participate in an Erasmus program in Greece
Personally I can't be 100% sure just by their appearance
I have seen people that I thought that they were Greeks but it turned out that they were tourists
Also there are some stereotypical faces for some countries , but many people from those countries don't fit in them .
BTW I want to say to some commenters that just because someone assumes that you are from France when you speak French this doesn't meant that this person thinks that French is only spoken in France
It's just that the most French speakers  are in France , so statically it's the best guess to make
>In The Netherlands almost every village/town has its own dialect of Dutch, so I wonder if that’s the same in the rest of Europe
Here, there is a difference from region to region, not so much from town to town , except for  villages and islands  that may have different customs and dialects, even though they are in the same region
So it's true for regions, villages and islands
I do not think so
It is general about people who mock Greece
It doesn't mention Germans, as far as I remember
I agree, we shouldn't think that gay is an insult
It is totally okay to be gay
Even the word itself has a positive meaning
I support Cyprus also Italy, Spain and the other Southern/Mediterranean European countries
I also support EU countries in general
I also support USA
That's almost the opposite from the other Greeks(except for the basketball part)
Nice comeback
I agree,  they are just exaggerating and dramatizing what happened
I doubt that thus will leas to third world war
But they killed someone guilty for many crimes,  someone who is the second in command in a country that kills apostates from Islam,  he attacked their embassy,  he killed many innocent people,  he is a violator of human rights etc
Personally I don't take sides here,  but I can't say that I support Iran or the general Qassem,  cause he was guilty
But General Qassem isn't innocent
He actually killed innocent people,  is the second leader in a country who kills apostates from Islam,  he is a violator of human rights
I think if you want to support peace and justice,  you shouldn't take sides
I guess that counts as a deregulation
Do they have any seats
&#x200B;
we have yellow press or yellow journalism  which is sensationalized news that aim to attract readers and audience without presenting news that are necessarily accurate
I am not sure how/when/where it started
edit: we also use the the phrase "pink video" to describe pornographic videos
I am not aware of something like that
I think most people here use google maps
The printed letters
Our school wasn't focused in writing styles,  they just wanted us to write properly
I don't think that's controversial in USA , maybe it is in some groups like vegans and vegetarians, but the same is true about Greek vegans and vegetarians and generally vegans and vegetarians from all countries . At least that's my experience based on  family friends from the US and based on Americans that I have met in Greece and they went to eat sea foods like octopus
I guess it also depends on the individual American too
Except if you are talking about living or moving octopus which is also considered disgusting here
I think that pastitsio and musaka( even though I don't like musaka) are some popular (here) Greek examples also I guess some deserts are rice pudding (rizogalo) , kormos etc
We call Belarus Λευκορωσσία which translates to White Russia,
We call Switzerland Ελβετία which is Elvetia
We call France Γαλλία which is Galia  ( g pronounced a wh from what)
Because the the southern -Mediterranean European countries have better climate to grow vegetables,  they are good in production of olive oil etc
Also food plays an important role in our cultures
I didn't mean that food plays an important role in our culture because of the climate
I meant it as an additional reason that the Southern European dishes are considered tasteful
But probably this is because of our climate, so maybe you are right
He said that's how they called today in Greece, for example in history classes
But I am not sure how the Byzantines called them
I think they didn't recognize them as Romans, because they recognized themselves as the true Romans
I think that this applies to church going people who are extremely religious .
Can you give an example of him speaking about an issue that he cares but he doesn't really get it
I haven't see anyone like that in real life, only on the internet, so I guess a small percentage of them might exist, but might be ashamed to say that the earth is flat because they know it's wrong
Vice once interviews a flat-earther and he was wearing a mask on his face
I think that it is mandatory to be vaccinated in order to go to school here
So how did she went to school
Yeah (and for everyone who migh be interested) it came from a word that originally means daddy
[  [
Not stupid , just something that I remember lol
German:
Hallo,Ich bin Stefanos, Ich komme aus Griechenland woher kommst du
Ich spiele
Ich liebe dich
&#x200B;
Spanish : no quiero provocarte
BTW Why did you thought that you were in Germany ?
I guess that counts as little .
I guess it can be useful sometimes lol
I think it's the same thing as to call Slovak republic Slovakia .
Do you usually say  Česko  or  Česká repulika  ?
OK you got me with that
My favorites towns to live are the towns that are in the southern suburb of Athens , and those near them that are outside of Athens
Because they are very peaceful and calm they have beautiful beaches,trees and mountains, there a lot more Green in comparison with a lot of other cities here, they are relatively economically advanced, there are a lot of things to do there ,they have plenty of shops, restaurants,cafes, activities , bowling etc and they are generally close to Athens, so you can find any activity, shop, subway,education center, a very big library and generally almost all things that you may need in Greece etc
I Also like Trikala because it's an  innovative and very well organised city, with very beautiful landscapes and it's also a soothing and peaceful place
I am talking about Voula,Glyfada, New Smyrni, Vouliagmeni etc etc
Is that considered a city
Some of the memes in my language are good
I want to know anything more
I buy the milk refrigerated and I put it again in fridge when I go home
The eggs aren't sold refrigerated, but I put them in the fridge
I use a qwerty keyboard but next to the Latin letters there are Greek and by pressing  shift+alt you switch alphabets .
Also the Byzantines called themselves and their empire Roman
>The common accent from Athens is just considered normal
I agree that almost anyone believes that,  but about the others you mentioned,  I think that it is more subjective
I think that most people are okay with it and don't really care if someone is eating alone
The only thing that I have heard is someone who was kinda shy (or ashamed)  of doing it
So as I understand it's not weird , but there are people who consider it weird
I had the opposite impression about Scandinavia
Yea many people across Europe wear them and I have seen some of them
I know a little bit, but I would like to educate myself in order to expand my knowledge about you
I think that's mostly true for countries like UAE, Saudi Arabia etc , based on my experience if they know that someone for example is Algerian then they will call them Algerian and not Arab
Edit: I think that most people here don't even think of Algerians as Arabs
I think that they show it every year before Christmas,  so in a way yes
Or generally outside of Attica :p
I think that also depends on the level of education for the people who 40+ years old, usually the most educated of them know (some) English
But the older you get the more rare it becomes
So for people who are old it's not common to be fluent in another language
Your teacher didn't know that Norway fought against Germany in WW2 ?
I hope that she wasn't a history teacher
I think that I have heard that story before
Are you a guy who went in college to USA and your teacher told you that there are colleges only for black people and you asked if there also colleges for white people
Okay then, sorry
So are you in Norway now
How was life in USA
Lol I just say that this thread is one moth old
Haha, I found it here [  and I clicked it to read it
I would also love to try horseback riding, so far I have only ride a pony when I was kid and it was great, and I love animals , so it would be a very pleasant experience
I am also thinking about visiting the states when I will finish my studies , I also want to visit  European countries
>I think I wanna visit countries in Europe first
Do you have specific countries in your mind
The people view it positively it has nice stuff and good food
It is considered kinda affordable, there are cheap stuff and stuff hat are more expensive, but the quality of it's products is regarded as good
In which country
I think they are ok
I know people who work in various jobs and have nose rings or ear rings and they are totally okay
Maybe there are some elderly people that don't really like them, but generally it's acceptable
But maybe it's also depends on the job, for example I would  guess that there would be specific rules for nurses
We do the opposite
We use commas as decimal separators
For example 1 euro and 2 cents is written as 1,02 euros and one million euros is written as 1
000
000  euros
Even though most people are culturally Christians and get baptized,  I think that most people don't care if you are an atheist,  I know many atheists and they are fine
Even our previous prime minister is an atheist
Even though most people are culturally Christians and get baptized,  I think that most people don't care if you are an atheist,  I know many atheists and they are fine
Even our previous prime minister is an atheist
I think this person means that most people if you that you are an atheist they ignore it/ don't care about it
I think that Cyprus is considered to be a part of Europe
At least in my opinion is definetely A European place
BTW I am curious you as a Cypriot  in which continent do you think that Cyprus belong to
Also do you feel more connectd with other European coutries or with Asia or with Africa
Germany, I think it's a very useful language and I also  like the German culture
Spanish, because it's sounds good, I like Spanish culture, it's a language that it's spoken by a lot of countries and it can help me to learn Italian and Portuguese
Luxembourgish because I like the country and their culture or maybe French for similar reasons and because French is a nice language and I think this and combination with the above languages would make it easier for to me to learn other European languages like Luxembourgish, Danish  etc
I think that all regural police officers have handguns
I think in my country not so good
Close to where I live there is a road for bikes close to southern suburbs of Athens ( I  this it is this one [ there is another one relatively close to me [
Also there some bike friendly cities like Trikala   [
So I guess it also depends on the municipality and on the people of each area
But generally the situation isn't good here, we need more and better infrastructures because there aren't a lot of such infrastructures
Actually there are bike roads in Athens like these   [  [
Also there some bike friendly cities like Trikala   [
So I guess it also depends on the municipality and on the people of each area
But the situation is still not  good here and we need to build better and safer infrastructure and better education about such things
I doubt that people think that bikes are for kids, at least where I live (southern suburbs of Athens) I have never heard that or something similar
But I guess things might be different in other areas
I visit family members , but very rarely (if ever) all the  family members meet together .
But usually If I meet many relatives at the same time, it would be for an event like new year eve, Christmas ,a wedding or a funeral or for another event
Usually we eat and drink and trying to have fun and sometime we are debating .
I think that depends on the degree ,the experience and of the job that they might have and on the expenses that they have
But generally is not much compared to north-western European countries
>Quite the opposite I would say
Parents here and the society in general pressure you to not proceed with making a family before you mature enough, figure out what you're gonna do in life and/or find a stable income
I agree
>With women though, that is not completely the rule as they start facing pressure from their inner circle as their friends begin to get married and have children
I don't know if that is self-imposed or actual externally imposed pressure
I think it depends on condition, sometimes it's self-imposed, sometimes it's expected , but am not sure if it's actual pressure or just  expectations ( mostly from older generations or based on area or based on social circle) sometimes neither
I think nowadays there many women in those ages that haven't made a family, so I guess it's common today
Less corruption, better social and egalitarian policies, better education, and economy and more kindness
I think there is a law here since 2015-2017 and it’s obligatory for all stores here to accept payment through card, maybe there isn’t such law in Italy
That would be great
I think that it should be taught in schools
Are you sure about the last part
One of my yeacher told us in highschool that it is actually closer and it was based on studies by scholars etc
>He was Dutch, he wasn't acclimated to the Greek alphabet or the language's intricacies
I am nor sure if his nationality matters, there is a Belgian guy in youtube who speaks very good Greek a, I think that someone  who studies a language can become fluent in that language . BTW I am not saying this about this specific person but in general
> While his efforts were valiant and advanced the understanding of how our ancestors spoke back then, Greek scholars have reconstructed a pronunciation that is closer to how the ancient tongue was spoken
Yeah I think thatere many good Greek profesors who have made accurate remarks about the anceint Greek pronounciation . I just said that Erasmian is closer to ancient Freek pronounciation (based on ancient sources) than the modern Greek pronounciation , based on academia (even in Greek universities) , not that it's perfect or better than other reconstructed accents based on ancient sources
&#x200B;
War of 1897
Poor economic management
Cold: -1°C-5°C
Chilly: 10°C-12°C
Perfect: 25°C-30°C
Warm: 31°C-34°C
Hot : 35°C or more
But it also depends on other circumstances such as wind and humidity
BTW Congratulations for using °C. I guess it is beneficial to be in a European sub
I agree with that
I like [Olympiakos's logo] ( I hope that's not due to the fact that I am biased)    [Celta's Vigo logo] ,  [Kubikenborgs IF]  and   [Boavista logo] .
I guess in terms of how easy it's to get a job I would recommend physical therapy, computer science-software engineer, cooking, nursing schools  and  military schools and police academies ,because you work immediately after graduation
We also have good tap water
We also say στην άλλη άκρη του κόσμου which means at the other edge/side of the world
We also say στην άλλη άκρη του κόσμου which means at the other edge/side of the world
Devil's mother is also a real place in Ireland
Btw We also use that expression in Greece
To be fair it sounds like a made up name and I also thought that it is a made up name as a little kid
>Εγκέλαδος (Engelados) = Earthquake, and also a name of a Titan, son of Tartarus and Gaia, who shook the earth whenever he was pissed off
As far as I know, we use the word σεισμός sismos for earthquake
Maybe engelados is used sometimes metaphorically for something that causes earthquake for example χτύπημα του Εγκέλαδου or sometimes just Εγκέλαδος.
I thought that σεισμος was the most formal one and the other was more metaphorical , but maybe it's because I hear σεισμος more often ( by people, news etc)
17-18 (It depends which month they have their birthday)
6 years of elementary school, 3 years of gymnasium and 3 years of Lyceum ( I think they are called junior and senior high school in English)
A European passport
But you can travel to all EU member states,  without a passport
So I am not sure even if passports are necessary,  except if you travel outside of European Union
I think that you don't need passport to travel to European Union/Schengen, just something that counts as valid ID
Ok, amigo
True, but I think that it's not always mentioned
For an average family of 4, it is mostly one of tge followings 100,120,150,200
It depends how many members a family has,  what foods they are eating and if they cook their own food
It is pretty easy to go to other Schengen countries, you just show your national ID ( or something that it counts as valid ID like passport) , based on my experience
But the countries that share boarders with my country aren't Schengen members
Brussels , European Parliament, Flanders and Walloon
Beautiful city
lol
> where the cheap  blah blah
There is a stereotype that Scots are stingy , I don't know where it came from
If you have problem with receiving money and you don't know what to do with them, contact me
Haha, I was just kidding(lol I know it's obvious)
Hahaha

>Be it the country itself
How can the country invent something by itself
You are right
That's true but I was referring to Herodotus who first treated historical subjects using a method of systematic investigation—specifically, by collecting his materials and then critically arranging them into an historiographic narrative
So I mostly meant history with systematic and organized form
Thank you,  I will add it
I was just uncertain in the beginning,  because,  when I had a conversation with a guy and he told me that technically all people had a kind of philosophy
Thank you
I just added what I remembered
Btw Did algebra start here
I think it was invented by Babylonians
Thank you,  I will add it
Well,  we are pretty good at that,  but as you may ( or maybe not
)  know other nations before Greece had national debt,  so unfortunately I can't add it to the list of our inventions
It's okay,  no offense taken
I added the  test Pap or Pap test,  which is a recent invention
Btw I got it,  I was kinda kidding
Yeah,  I think you are right
Yeah,  I think Pythagoras gave that name first
Yeah,  it's common knowledge
I guess I was just misinformed
pro : we have free universities and free healthcare, good weather, there are helpful and nice people here, nightlife
cons :  our economy isn't so good, there is a rise of extremist parties
I thought that you would say more European cause in another comment you were talking about LGBTQ rights , progressivism etc and usually Europe is culturally more progressive and egalitarian (about genders etc) ( Except if I remember another person)
Yeah I get that and you definetely have a point
I think that there different types of cultures like national/social cultureand political culture and I would say that my country is politcally more Eruopean ( also we are in mainland Europe) I am not sure about Cyprus though
For example we have democracy , freedom of speech etc so I feel more alligned with other European countries (when it comes to that\_ rather than with some Middle Eastern countries ( even thought there some democratic countries there, I think that based on what I have read Isreal is the most democratic country there)  But Yeah I also identify with East Med , but even more with Southern Europe, because I have observed that we also have similarities with some Souther European countries  in terms of culture climate, family,attitude etc
Yes, of course they can
Unfortunately I didn't have cooking lessons in my school
I like the names Zahir , Axel , Wolfgang and Felix
At least it's a beautiful city, unlike Brussels
I teach straight guys to say the same thing , if they want to sleep with me and still call themselves straight
There many people who use fireplace and they burn woods inside it
It's not the most popular method but I know people who do it during the winter
Something that comes to my mind is the name "Europe".
I think most Southern Europeans ( at least that I know) like France
They sound fun, especially if you combine them, lol
Mostly people who cooperated with nazis
Such as Georgios Tsolakoglou, Konstantinos Logothetopoulos and Ioannis Rallis who were Prime ministers during Nazi occupation and basically puppets of Nazis
Also the people who took part in The Security Battalions (Greek: Τάγματα Ασφαλείας) or people who cooperated with them
Such as:  Ioannis Rallis
Theodoros Pangalos
Stylianos Gonatas
Georgios Grivas
Georgios Poulos
Lol haha
He didn't exactly sold it , because he made them sign that they have nothing to do with Alexander the great and the ancient history of Macedonia
He made them sign that their language is actually a Slavic language and he made them change their name from Macedonia to Northern Macedonia
Even the name Macedonian of their language hasn't any real historical meaning  because they signed that it is a Slavic language
It isn't a great deal
But  before the deal,  people from Macedonia called themselves Macedonia and they had statues of Alexander the great and the claimed Alexander the Great as their ancestor
But now those things changed
Tsipras made a compromission and he made the situation better than before
You have to compare the before and the after
Κανένα πρόβλημα,  και εγώ φιλικά τα γράφω και πιστεύω πως αν αγαπάμε πραγματικά την Ελλάδα δεν πρέπει να τσακωνόμαστε μεταξύ μας,  άλλα κάνουμε το καλύτερο για τη χώρα μας και τους πολίτες της.
I think that Nazi party had less than 50% support,  so I guess most Germans weren't supporters of the Nazi party
They were all part of Yugoslavia
We say French shower
I think that base on gdp generally the cities in the attica region like Athens have seen the biggest development
The capital Z is written Z (the same as the latin Z)  and the lower z is written ζ , but I have seen it written as cursive z. As far as I know it's written without a line
Not very common, but not very rare either , most people I know haven't a second name, I guess it's like like 1-2 per 10 people or 10-20 % maybe like 15%.
There are a few that I like
It's not something unique , but I lie it [
[ (I put this just because I like the statue)
Here is images of another pharmacy in southern suburbs of Athens that also looks cool  [
It looks awesome
>Units for Reinstatement of Order, but I guess that goes into political territory
I am not sure if they are into political territory , cause they are just part of the police and they are mainly for riots, protests etc and not directly related with politics even though the governments give them directions and commands
BTW I think that there also people who dislike journalists who are not honest and objective
>Any reasonable analysis puts him as centre right (or on the left, for any Americans reading
Why do you think that centre right is left for Americans
But I think that some democrats like Sanders are actually center left
He has said that he supports social democracy
So is it allowed to live and travel in Scengen without having any form of citizenship
Also how easy is to aquire ID or other documents without a citizenship
I don't like when people insult Italy
Yeah that's right
>  also Croatia only we can do that
It's like when you say something bad about your little bro or sis or another family member, only you have the right to do that not strangers
I agree with you
I think he mean jokes in a bad way about the situation of the country
>(and I kind of believe we do deserve them)
Generalizations are almost always wrong
>But luckily everyone is alloved to make fun of sweden :P
Lol ,I guess you are funny
that was actually funny
You are welcome <3 .
>Hah did you realize that Greece needs money haha haha Greece poor
That's a lie, I am going to come there to prove you wrong and I am going to bring evidence with me
I am kidding I won't come there but not because I have not money, yeah totally not for that
Btw you need to improve the grammar of your native language
/s of course (except from the grammar part)
>Since we are in the same boat
If we are in the same boat then it is a very good boat
Omg he shouldn't have said stuff like that especially when he came to your country as a tourist
> mafia
OK but can you do me a favor
Please don't kill me
Lol
Normally I should be afraid cause of the movie reference and the symbolism but I will accept it because I am so poor that I have nothing else to eat and I believe that a horse head would be a nice and tasty meal
Trust me, it's a both way street
>Sounds like something a Greek would make up
Well if you don't believe me, there some ways that will make you believe it for sure
( just kidding)
Actually the law says that women can't rape not that the man can't be raped
But yeah this law is kinda anachronistic, but even in that case women who rape men will be punished as rapists, I think the only difference is terminology
But that also might me a problem , because different words give a different "gravity" to situations
German movies is something unusual here
We mostly have American and British movies, but  occasional they show French movies and I there also times that they show movies from other European countries like Italian movies
If it's sunny not rainy then above 20 C I am comfortable, but sometimes even above 16 C if it's higher than 20 C during the rest of the day
For example today the temperature is 16 C to 24 C in my town and I am comfortable wearing short sleeves outside
That sounds interesting
Where can I find more information about this
Same here, except the last two ( I think)
Footing isn't really used here ( as far as I know) and meeting may refer to a formal appointment in general like in business convention not just for political stuff
Yeah
BTW nice name .
It makes sense
Whatever you said
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
>We've been kinda chill with Bulgaria but we sort of went to war twice in the 1900s I guess
Plus I think that  there was a conflict over a dog
Me neither, I learnt it from reddit lol
It is mostly known as Αυστροουγγαρία or as Αυστροουγγρική Αυτοκρατορία
Literally Austrohungary (more informal) or  Austrohungarian Empire (more formal)
Yeah,  there is a space in my fridge for eggs
But it doesn't really matters
You killed him with that
Don't you tell me that you are one  of those beer guys
If yes, your compatriots might send you to Germany or to eastern Europe
You just revealed the secrets of your country
They are spiritual people
That sounds like a superpower
I knew some Polish in school, but I guess school wasn't a good environment for drinking
I think that most people prefer wine, but I personally prefer milk
BTW Where are you from
So are you here because you like various European countries and their culture, or you are an American that secretly spies EU in order to destroy it
lol just kidding
BTW What do you like to drink in USA, in the State you live
I speculate that beer is the most popular drink, but I might be mistaken
That's  not offensive , in some cases it's good
Yeah
No,  but once I with two guys were walking and a group of people asked us if we have money with us and I think they said us to show our money to them and we ran away
Someone took my pen and gave back a pen that didn't work
What a little monster he was
Is it common in Netherlands to steal bikes
3 times
do you live in an area with high criminality or it was "bad luck"?
Here it depends, if someone ask you a pen to write something or temporarily the they supposed to gie it back
There do they suppose to never return it even if they asked for just one minute
If that's the case at least you know it, also if that's the case would it be rude if you asked them if they are done with the pen
I think it depends on the neighborhood of Athens
I live in southern suburbs and it is generally very safe here at all hours
Not only the centers
I live in suburbs and I am also not reliant to car
But there is not much traffic,  so I guess the situation is better than the center
>Can you tell me some positive news from your country / region
some positive news from your country / region . Lol
I wish I had something else to say
&#x200B;
BTW something actually positive is that we have a lot of tourists near the place that I live
Is the political party of Zelensky going to take part
Btw is he a good president
>positive news
&#x200B;
>We may have the most nuclear weapons in the world
I guess the definition for the word positive is different for every person
>  I barely see them
Me too
I guess people took the tv show and his role really seriously
Maybe they still hope that he will change something for good because he is president for a short time
Btw what is his political position/ affiliation ? Would say he is left winger, right winger, a centrist or something else
I think that after football basketball is the most popular spot at least in Greece and some people here sometimes get crazy over it
>*Passes out on a couch with Sweden
Why with Sweden
Is that a reference of something I do not know
>Us, Spain, Italy and Greece are asking Germany to pick up the tab
We would also ordered many foods and drink alcohol galore and we would drunk alcoholic drinks
Greece would, ordered many foods, got drunk, started to sing drunk songs with Germany and asked you a loan , so we can pay for everything we ordered
Thank you for suggesting us
You will not regret it
Haha, true
Actually that's probably good for us
Because when we take loans we also paid interests and we loose money
>Griechischer Wein
I just heard it and I like it, even though I don't understand the lyrics
I have "forgot" my German
It was last applied in 1972, and the death penalty was abolished in stages between 1975 and 2005 including wartime crimes, treason that weren't covered when the death setence was first abolished etc
As far as I know it was a politcal decision, I don't know if there was a big push
There are some people who proposed it
I think oficially only alt-right parties propose it, but maybe there are people from other political ideologies that want it
To be more specific  Capital punishment was abolished for peacetime crimes other than [high treason] **during wartime** by article 7 of the [Constitution of 1975] Oficially it was abolished in 2005 for all purposes
But practivally it had stopped since 1972
I think you are right and for some reason 3% of people voted him , even if he lied about having letters of Jesus and then he took it back , but the video that he said it still existed, that was clearly dishonesty . His followers are literally delusional
I think it depends on the people and on the immigrants
Some people are welcoming and some people are xenophobic
But I know some immigrants who live here for many years and they are generally fine here
BTW How do Americans view the people who immigrate to their country
I use a knife or a pizza cutter, but that sounds like a nice idea, I might try it
I don’t see it as weird, it’s just a different way to cut your pizza
Actually, I think that u/skidadle_gayboi was right because people usually different the metropolitan area or the greater area of the city with the city itself and usually they specify it when they are using the metro area or the greater area
I think it's correct to use the municipality Athens to refer to the city of Athens because it's a city in the sense that it has a mayor, a city council etc
>No one would say Athens is only 664,00 people or that Thessaloniki is 354,000
Yeah, but it depends on the context
Many people here talked about cities as administrative subdivisons .By whether you talk about metro area or the municipality of Athens is not really misleading, except if somoene asked about the one thing and you answer about the other thing ( but that's not what happened)
Yes for example George IV is Called Γεώργιος aka Yeorjios or Yeoryios .
Mcdonalds is popular
Some  Fridays or Saturdays  that I pass through it,  it's full of people
BTW There are also local fast food restaurants that sell burgers and stuff like that
But Greece isn't in a good economic state and maybe people on other countries pay more money for food outside than us or people here choose cheaper option when they go out and they don't spend a lot of money
(For example  Cyprus that it has similar culture but better economy , was darker on this map
)  Another reason might be that Goody's was already established there
But I think it is relatively popular in the big cities (not so much in small cities or in rural areas)   here based on Greek standards
For example I read there that they won 33 million in 2018, which is a lot for a fast food restaurant in Greece, There are a few who win so much like Goody's, Pizza Fan etc
or maybe it's just popular in my town
( by popular I mean that the store is full of customers when I visit it, I usually visit it on Friday and Saturday)
at least in Athens, I think its; doing quite well
I think more half of the outlets are here, so maybe it isn't so popular in rural areas
I live in southern suburb of Athens
So I guess they might only be popular here in Athens
When I was a kid, the parents just drove their kids to parties without staying there
Here I think that this happens only if you have a good job or a good position, for example I know someone who is engineer in a big company and he has like 200k euros in his bank account
But the average person who does an average job here  doesn't have a sufficient disposable income
But it also depends on the job and on position
As far as I know no
Are social libertarians included in liberals
>to be equal to social democratic
Many countries don't have "labour-parties" but they have social democratic parties, so I guess these people chose "socialist"
But I think that they mods should have added more categories, because now some ideologies are underrepresented
Personally I was between liberal and green
I also like social democrat but I wouldn't like to put socialist , because I am more of a libertarian social democrat, but I am also pro-environmentalist and supporter of green policies, so I guess I am green libertarian social democrat
I think it's popular many people that I know have them ( even though enough of them don't  take care of it ) , but I also know people who look better with shaved beard so they shave it or they can't grow it so they shave it
>/Russian/
How common is Russian language in Finland
Also are those people of Russian ancestry
In the future at least 100 years after now, or even 1000 years
I would able too see new art,  learn new things
Also due to more advanced scientific knowledge available, there will be less prejudices and false/ unscientific  beliefs better technology
Probably there would be less hard work due yo automation and maybe more work related with art and philosophy
In addition there would be less hunger in the world because of technologies like cultured meat
Plus I would able to enjoy all the things that exist right now
Most of the times no, but sometimes yes
Obviously they take of their shoes when they want to lay in bed or on the couch even if they don't take them of while enetering their house
lol when I enter in my house with my shoes the floor is still clean and it doesn't become dirty easily except if my shoes are dirty(if for expample I go to a dirty place or if its rainy etc) .
If cafes count, then definitely this hard rock cafe at municipality of Athens
I like those building of Goodys [
And those buildings from McDonalds
[ from municipality Glyfada, (southern suburbs of Athens, Attica) I kinda look that it's look kinda different than the rest of them
[ from Rhodes)
That's based on the fast food buildings I know and remember, there might be betters that I am unaware of
It is not uncommon to eat
Based on friends and family it is not something you eat every weak , but yes it is considered normal to eat them here
>Thsi might be a weird question, but I heard few people say how they don't understand that some people eat rabits, deers, ducks
Where are they from
Do they think that's weird
Some Americans here said that it is not abnormal and some other said that it is kinda weird
So I guess it depends on the State .
Btw In what State did you live
Where are you from
I wouldn't watch it if I was in your position
Do you support any sides
Personally I know Jewish people and I like them,  so I culturally feel closer to them . But I also would like a independent state for Palestine,  but under a different government because hamas has violated human rights many times
Btw where in Israel did you go
Yeah I mostly agree with what you said
I am not sure about the whole country,  but in my town I have noticed we have sushi bars/restaurants,  Italian restaurants,  Indian restaurants,  Chinese foods,  pizzerias,   we also have American fast food restaurants with burgers,  chicken wings etc Mexican restaurants, and if I remember correctly we also have middle eastern food
Also I think that there is a place(or places)  that have have variety of European cuisines
Thank you for your kind words
>How is the Mexican food
I think that it depends on the place
In some places like big cities,  it's easy to find a Mexican restaurant .
Btw I also like American foods
I like American foods like some Texas BBQ foods , I liked it very much it was tasty and I liked the combinations they made,  I also like your fast food like burgers
I don't remember eating something that I disliked it
Here is a quote that from Greek literature that I like,  but I don't know if it's common in media
"I hope nothing
I fear nothing
I am free
" Kazantzakis
An American who into (real)  football and into Euro
You seem like a nice friend
Of course it is, I understand you
transgender people were granted the right to change their legal gender without having to undergo surgical alteration of their genitals in order to have key identity documents changed
This can be done from 15 years of age ( but with parental consent I think since the person is a minor)
Since 2005, discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace has been prohibited
It depends what do you mean by poverty
In Greece most people have a place live and they can afford eating , clothing etc
There are some ~35k people however who are homeless, so that's how poverty looks like for the most poor people
There are others who have lost their jobs and have trouble to pay all of their expenses on time and others who can afford all the basic things and can't afford something more like holidays, buying new phone often etc
edit: Also I think that for one person the minimum wage is enough for housing and utilities in medium to poor neighborhoods
But it's hard to maintain a household with a family
At least we have free healthcare and education
Do you have to pay for university there
We would be the employee who is asking for loans from other employees .
Yes
I was taught British English, I have watched some British movies and TV shows, but I watched many movies and TV shows in American English
I think most Europeans, except British and Irish, use words from Both languages
Many times when I see someone saying stuff like "How y'all doing" or "Howdy" I think of them as Americans from the South
But some of them, aren't from the US South, they just like these words or the US Southern culture in general
Maybe they meant cunt
Yeah, I am aware that this doesn't apply to everyone from the south of America
I just think that most people who use these words/phrased are usually from the southern states of America
Okay, thank you for pointing it out
BTW your username "deuteros" means second in Greek
But there is also a videogame with that name
Hopefully they are minority
Unfortunately they (neonazis) still exist
Here the name Nikolas ( or Nikos)  is widely used .
And the AfD thinks that refugees are going to commit crimes and destroy Germany
I agree
That's why I prefer fried potatoes on pizza
Yeah and it has nice taste
It sounds tasty .
BTW Is that it [ ?
Yeah I agree
BTW how is the situation , regarding this issue, in United States of America
I think it's good , what Europe does
The only thing that puzzles me is the future of Europeans who do such jobs ( coal related etc) , but I guess this issue will be solved until 2050
That refugees are criminals who have iphones  and money and they want to take over out country
That we are poor
I guess as  a European country that's true,  but worldwide we are above the middle
Unfortunately we have it,  but I haven't heard about him since a long time ago
Same thing here and the Muslims are barely 5% .
Btw the weird thing about anti-EU sentiment is that think that eu turns Europe into a Nazi empire and from the other hand they consider that it has a extreme left wing agenda
That made me chuckled lol
Btw the weird thing about anti-EU sentiment is that think that eu turns Europe into a Nazi empire and from the other hand they consider that it has a extreme left wing agenda
I wasn't even aware that there was an anti-Norwegian barnevernet movement in Europe .
I understand the more of it but no the first part ( I think it's a Greek expression, but I can't remember it)
Can you it write in Greek so I can sure it
Ααα οκ τώρα το κατάλαβα. Btw ο πολυέλαιος μεταφράζεται chandelier
>The fun part is that, my age group (35)
I am like 15 years younger than you and I am perfectly adapted to this situation,  I think the people who are less adapted are the people who are old as you said but younger than 70 maybe, because as you said young people are more comfortable with technology etc and  old people are used to stay at home
Yeah I have seen such ads
The last time we got real snow , in my area,  I was six years of age
Yes,  I still live in Greece
May I learn the reason you ask
It depends
In southern Greece it rarely snows, but in some regions of northern Greece it happens more often
For example Northern Florina
>As a kid I also thought tiramisù was a Finnish invention
When I was a very young kid, I though that the word tiramisu was Greek, but then I learn that it was Italian
I drink tap water most of the time, but when I am outside  and I really need to drink water, the I buy bottled water
I think, at least in my town, that it’s safe to drink tap water
But I think it’s not so good on the islands
May I ask where do you live
I live in a town in Attica and most people here drink water without filter and I think it’s healthy and safe
Maybe it depends on the region/city/town
There are trans people today and it is legal to change your gender today in Greece
Also I think that kids in some countries like USA ( I think) can't just change their gender, they are seen by therapists to check if they actually have gender dysphoria or something like that
But even there there LGBT community doesn't have a single opinion , they aren't a monolithic organization
You can change it at 17 with the consent of the parents  or at 18 without anything .
Tbh I haven't heard a Greek lgbt person advocating for 3 year old trans kids, even many americans pro-lgbt disagree with it online
Who are you
But some words aren't used or they have changed and have different form
It's kinda hard and probably unlikely to fully understand the Homeric Greek without studying it
But generally I agree
I think that in my country you are obliged to be vaccinated in order to go to school
So I think that vaccination is in a way mandatory in my country
I would like if there was a EU law for that cause a lot of people of other EU countries go to my country as tourists and to others countries, so I think that it would be safest for all
(for example babies who aren't vaccinated yet)
In some movies and tv shows sometimes the subtitles aren't accurate and there are some mistakes
For example :
Boyfriend  -> friend
Analogy -> observation
Practical -> Technical
Relief -> happiness
Trust -> believe
Where I live the weather today is 23-31 C .
What are the political disagreements with your follow countrymen
>And if someone from outside of Europe asks me, I usually say that I'm German, because I'm sick and tired of talking about Kangaroos, Koalas and Australian Rule Football or whatever this is
Lol I kinda laughed with this
The form of government of Greece is that of a parliamentary republic
Popular sovereignty is the foundation of government
All powers derive from the People and exist for the People and the Nation; they shall be exercised as specified by the Constitution
BTW I am Greek and I haven't heard that the situation is so bad before
But it makes sense because of negative effects of lignite
Ούτε και εγώ.
The irony is that EU was created to prevent wars and situations like that
So they want to kill white people by uniting them
That sounds crazy
True
The good thing is that I have only see such crazy things online
Some people are very delusional , to the point that they may need professional help
Nice anime
Personally I make a circle (ο)and then i write the ι α.
Third time is a charm .
Luxembourg,Finland,Italy,Spain,Greece
Yeah
BTW You also have beautiful places that I would like to visit
I have family there and it is nice
BTW I would love to go to your country, it seems very nice and you have a good quality of life
Are you sure about that
I would like to live there, the only problem is that maybe some people may believe in some stereotypes about where I come from
It depends on lot of factors like wind, hydration etc
But I guess at around 15C°, but sometimes higher
Right now it's like close to 19 C° here and I am fine going out with a T-SHIRT
But as I said earlier this might change if it's very windy outside
Also it depends if I go somewhere close or not
Btw I haven't wear a jacket since many months ago
. I think below 25-20 °C is low for the summer only, but in January ,for example, it would be warm , because usually it's way below that
That's mostly for Athens (  ) mountainous places have kinda different weather, especially in winter they are colder
European countries (included my country)  ,European Union,  Some specific type of buildings and architecture
I have voted one time on each election ( National, European, Regional, Municipal)  and I voted for the party that I was closest ideologically and has a chance to enter the parliament and I preferred for each case, even though I may had some disagreements
Based on what I read 37% of Greeks are smokers
and 27% are daily smokers
[ )
Personally I do not smoke because I do not like it and as someone else said   it is very widely regarded as unhealthy and stinky .
edited
Are you sure about that
Based on what I read 37% of Greeks are smokers
and 27% are daily smokers
&#x200B;
Also  it is  widely regarded as unhealthy and stinky .
I agree
The same is true for the people I interact
All smokers that I know  smoke only on specific occasions
I think the numbers of smokers in the last few years are lower, because as you said it is regarded as unhealthy and stinky
This was from 2017 actually .
*Thirty-seven percent of Greeks are smokers*
But unfortunately we are still the first in EU
I think that research from the WHO took place in 2016
But still we are in a bad place and we need to improve and progress .
Do you know the reason(s) that many people from many countries call you Holland
That's true ,even though the official name is βασίλειο των κάτω χορών , kingdom of Netherlands
BTW personally I didn't have a problem calling them Netherlands in English,  because that's the most common name that is used in English
You are right
Also, Cyrillic is as different with Greek alphabet as Latin
There are some letters in common,  but there are also many different letters
~~Btw shouldn't you have used Κυριακή aka Sunday cause the feeling happens on Sunday
edited
Ah ok I just thought it would be more specific if you use Sunday, but it makes sense that way
An English guy who calls football "soccer".
You should take a DNA test
I assume that by fries you mean French fries
At least do you like souvlaki ,gyros and buttfucking
hahaha Which Balkan countries did it show
BTW did you know or did it come as a surprise for you
I like fried potatoes very much,  they are good in some places here
But if fried potatoes are so good in Belgium then I have to go there to try them
In modern times I would say that it was the years before the economic crisis cause we had the highest gpd per capita increase and in general the highest gps (per capita)  in our history, lower unemployment,  we were ( and I think still are)  in a good place in life expectancy
People who think that you are still nazis are hypocrites or just dumb or just extremely uninformed and out of touch with reality
Based on most comments,  all European languages are very  hard to learn,  or at least that's what their native speakers think
Bte at least for Greek,  it's  not so hard as people are saying  , with right practise and dedication someone can speak very well,  there is a Belgian guy who speaks Greek like native
US too because they were among the first nations that recognized us
They even named a town after us for this reason
I am also thankful that you supported us ( the Allies) against the Axis during WW2 .
Congratulations
I like discussing with people on this sub
It's my favorite subreddit about Europe and one of my favorite subreddits generally
I especially like the fact that most people are tolerant and open minded
Keep up the good work
Greece
We had many wars/conflicts with them and our people are constantly fighting with each other
But seriously it depends ho you ask, because some people may like some people that other perceive them as rivals
You mean us
Our people are constantly fighting with each other
lol
I don't plan to move to another country,  but if I did I would choose Luxembourg
It has friendly people, high quality of life, good salaries,  open minded society without extreme right wing parties in it's parliament
Also I would like to move to USA because in some professions it's one of the countries with highest salaries, and I also like it for other reasons
I am not sure if this counts as a child story though
It depends on many factors such as the age of the person and the environment that they are in
Also when people, especially young people, are going to parties clubs,bars etc many people are drinking in order to have fun and to enjoy the feeling of drunkenness, not to the point that they can't walk, but to the point that they experience a feeling of euphoria . Also some people might want to combine alcohol like wine with their meals
But generally people here like alcohol
edited

Some people kike to drink in order to experience a feeling of joy or euphoria
They do not necessarily won't to get drunk to the point they can barely walk
Also some people might want to combine alcohol like wine with their meals
(Since some Germans are speaking about Swiss German) I can understand Cypriot Greek when I read it, but not when I hear it
Lol
Funnily , linguists think that there was a proto Indo-European language that was the root of all European languages,  but no European can understand it,  except the linguists who are researching it ( maybe)
I agree with you  it's very important to keep it that way, to build a free, democratic, social, united, and peaceful Europe
It's truly fascinating what you guys achieved
We also have KFC here in Greece, that's an advancement, I guess
I think that would be better in all aspects, because until now the history has proven that the societies are evolving and developing with ups and downs of course ( based on quality of life, wars, mortality ate, goods that a person is able to buy, engineering, technology, medicine and generally scientific discoveries etc)
So , I guess it would be more economically developed more united and peaceful the political climate will be better
About culture I don't know, but I guess it would be more adjusted to the needs of the time
Finally I have now clue about demographics, but I guess the change won't be very big
We, as humans, have also created smartphones, internet, vr , more developed artificial intelligence etc
Btw how do Finnish people feel about Russia
(I am asking since you are both from Finland and Russia
That's true, but I think that almost half of English words have Latin/Romance root
That's a good idea
(BTW I think that the cross ins't only a religion symbol , it has also another use ,it was also the symbol of the Greek seafarers because it symbolized the four points of the horizon
But since it has a religious meaning I agree, because we are a republic which believes in freedom
Also historically we had other religions before Christianity
Then should we have symbols of the ancient religious traditions, since they are also history
EDIT : Also orthodox church was AGAINST the revolution for the Greek independence
We can put an Epsilon of  ancient Greek style
Καλή ιδέα και αυτό!
And the Olympic games, the theater, battles about freedom from Persian empire happened because of ancient Greek religion ( or at least that was the excuse), so we should also honor that religion and have such a symbol in our flag
&#x200B;
Anyway back to what you said
Revolutionists  used some religions or theistic phrases to spread the messages for revolution , because most people were influenced by religion and the church was hostile towards revolution, so they wad to do that in order to make them fight and not get influenced by the official religious institutes .
. But religion was also used by official institutes against the revolution and against the Greek nation
"Είμαι χριστιανός, ως εκ τούτου δεν δύναμαι να είμαι Έλλην." Γεννάδιος Σχολάριος.
That means I am christian and therefore I can't be Greek
: «είναι θέλημα Θεού η Πόλη να τουρκέψει» That means it is the will of god for the city to be Turkish and it was said by the orthodox patriarch
&#x200B;
Also the orthodox church was **AGAINST** the revolution for the Greek independence, so based on your logic we should not honor that church and it's dogmas
&#x200B;
So religion was used both in support ( mainly as way to convince religious people, but I guess the same would have happened even if we had another religion as it did happen before Christianity) and  against the revolution but the official religious institutes such as the Orthodox Church was against the revolution
**EDIT:** Just to be clear, I am not against Christians, only against specific religious institutions and radical and extremely religious people and alt-rights and extreme conservatives
Also I don't like that some priests said that covid isn't transmitted through the spoon in the holy communion
>it
I personally think it blends in very well in a design with lines and generally it remains discrete and nice
We can put an ancient Greek epsilon or another symbol that represents Greece as a whole
But I think that ancient Greek epsilon would fit fine
I would also like to thank Italy for the amazing food,culture,history,architecture, for your beautiful country and for being nice and friendly
Thank you Netherlands for your support
Wow that's a very well written and wholesome answer
So thank you Denmark for Lego, for having a well organized and beautiful country and for insulin
Thank you Serbia
It's truly great that we are allies and support each other
Thank you also for having a beautiful country
Only before sleep
Anyway the doors can't open from the outside, but it's  safer to lock them
Who needs a garage when you have a living room
Wait, so can someone just enter into your house uninvited
I didn't know that
Do you have the types of door that can be opened from the outside
I live in southern suburbs of Athens
It is nice here
Because I can go to the center relatively fast by car or with public transport ( 25 mins) and I can enjoy beautiful neoclassical buildings and nice ancient monuments and all the benefits of a big city
Also in the southern suburbs there are  mountains and there also many beaches . Also it is relatively relaxing and quiet  and there isn't a big density, so I can enjoy my personal space when I wait for bus without being squeezed
EDIt : Also Attica is the most economically advanced region of Greece
I agree
I live there and it's nice
There are lot of thins all the pros of a big city plus I am close to the sea and to the mountain at the same time
I doubt that Athens is uglier than all the other cities
It has beautiful neoclassical buildings and nice ancient monuments
Also in the southern suburbs there mountains and there also many beaches
BTW I live in southern suburbs
Edit: Also Attica is the most economic advanced region of Greece
Here she is also teaching English,  but I don't remember her nationality/ethnicity
I guess I didn't pay attention to it when I was like 5 or 6 and maybe they didn't mention it
edited
BTW about your previous question " Do you guys expect Americans to be white or black or are Hispanics more familiar now
I think that someone can be black or white while also being Latino
Personally I have American friends and they are white, so I think Americans as White , but also as Black and occasionally as Asians ( just for the fact that there are less Asian Americans)
When I think of Latinos, sometimes I think them as non-Americans like Mexican, Cuban etc citizens and sometimes I might think of the as USA citizens, I guess it depends on the occasion and on the Latino person
But if he is a white nationalist why are there black people who support him
For example Candace Owens , politicians like senators, etc
I am not trying to argue with you, I am just curious
Kinda yeah , from movies and such
But also some movies and some public figures of USA portray them as immigrants so sometimes I have this image in my mind , but I know that's not always the case and many of them are legit American citizens
About their culture I know that they mostly speak Spanish and secondary Portuguese (mostly Brazilians) , they are family oriented,  I know they are generally hard-working and I know some foods and music of theirs
But generally I don't know very much about them
BTW That's just my impression some of these things might be inaccurate
I think that these people viewed as foreigners the latin Americans that  immigrated now to the country and they wanted to stop illegal immigration and illegal immigrants etc , but I think that they didn't have something specifically against them as an ethnic group, they said that it was only due to legal reasons
But I have also seen one video of someone who said that US was a nation of white people and other racist bs
I hope that he was a troll and he didn't mean all the racist things that he said, but unfortunately racism exist in all countries ( to some extent)
The name souvlaki
Northern Greeks call souvlaki what the Southern Greeks call kalamaki (the  type of meat that’s on the stick) , but Southern Greeks call souvlaki the combination of pita(some type of bread) meat, sauce, fries or whatever someone puts in it
The word patat sounds like the Greek word patata which means potato , I think both of them come from the Spanish word patata and that is maybe loan word from a native language
The problem with pitogyro is that some people put chicken or other kinds of meat instead of gyro , but this word describe only the pita that it is wrapped with gyro, but  the word souvlaki as used in the Southern Greece is more generic and covers all cases
Here there is also the word geomilo which means potato, but literally means earth apple, but most people just use the word patata
Things like airplanes( I think they are already to some extent), train and rail systems and ships who travel throughout Europe
I guess if other countries want a EU army like a military alliance would be good
I would also want the EU court to take action against violation of human rights
Also it would be nice to set better infrastructure and education standards since EU is funding countries for that purpose
edit: Also it would be good to extend the EU health insurance card for something like common health insurance for the whole EU
Or maybe something like USA but adjusted for EU  .
There would be some federal laws that will apply everywhere and will be above national laws but there would also be national laws
Do you know why is that happening
But there are differences here
For example there are stereotypes and expressions for villagers such as άντε ρε βλαχε villagers have stereotypes about city people . There are also differences in work life, life style ,infrastructures etc
How many of us love drinking milk
I love drinking milk
I like milk more than beer or wine
I wish that there were milk bars
I am wondering ...how many of you love drinking milk
EDIT : I didn't mean milk bars as we say cereal bars , I meant bars that sell milk instead of alcohol
EDIT 2 : See this videoit contains information ,at some point, on how to start drinking milk, if you are lactose intolerant( if you are not, I do not see any reason to do what he suggests)
Yes, it counts
It's okay
Nobody is perfect
>I had a serious problem growing up but now I'm more of an occasional drinker
I am a heavy drinker lol
>makes you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence
yeah, since it makes you strong
Yea it is soothing and refreshing
BTW I also prefer whole milk
>But I love anything made out of milk, cream, butter, cheese, yogurt
Hmm
That's something
Maybe we will accept you to milk lovers club
I can totally relate to that
Yeahh
It is so nice and refreshing
Do they have so good milk
Maybe I should try it one day
I also haven't broke a bone
I just found out there is a sub for this
lol
Yeah
Milk Gang
I also prefer milk or chocolate milk over coffee !!
Maybe you should check it
I guess, I will come to you
I think the process of moving there is very easy because of EU, but I  guess I will struggle a little bit with the language
I didn't mean milk bars as we say cereal bars , I meant bars that sell milk instead of alcohol
Maybe I have to edit it , to make it clear
What did just write
I can't read it
Unhomogenised milk is better
Pure milk is awesome
May you be healthier soon
I wish you to be able to enjoy milk again !
At least you understand some of it's benefits
That's a good point
BTW Blin is Russian pancake , right
Yeah it is also very good with donuts and croissants
I also love drinking cold milk, it is so refreshing
But I tend to use warm to hot milk, when I  am ill or when I have a headache
In many European countries is very common to drink milk
How about America
How do you feel about this thread and all these Europeans (including me) who like drinking milk
BTW Can you elaborate on why you feel nauseous
I agreI agree with that
I prefer to drink real milk small farms
Yeah
But I have to make it clear that this idea is copyrighted .
It is protected under the Greek and European law about copyrights
lol
I agree with you
They are the two best and most useful drinks
That's an awesome record
Cold milk with cookies is a great combination
You do well !!! Milk is better than soda
Welcome to club
Well, I am hydrated
Milk keeps me hydrated
But I also drink plenty of water
I agree with this
I also prefer fresh milk
That's nice
Stay strong
Haha it makes sense
Btw I am kinda surprises that someone found this thread after so long
We also don't drink sterilized milk very often
Whole milk is the best
I guess that's something
I also like drinking chocolate milk
I also like drinking it with cacao
Why do you believe that it is not very healthy
What place was that
It has to be a real nice place
Cheese is great
I like to eat milk with cereals for breakfast
We are many
Yeah !!! Milk for life
Yea it is blessed
Maybe you should edit that comment or they will see you
The Greek word for milk is γάλα - gala ( g is pronounced as y or as wh from what)
Cold milk is just so refreshing
Give me milk or give me death
lol
Can you tell me some of these meals
( I am interested)
BTW How is life in Japan
Do they accept European people ( or generally non Asians) easily
I like goat milk, but I usually drink cow's milk , cause that's more common
The milk that isn't low fat or skim milk is called whole milk
That sounds awesome
Yeah usually, in less urbanized areas you can buy milk directly from producers and it is going to be more fresh /cheap and flavorful
I think in my cities they have installed some kind of milk machines in corporation that they have fresh milk directly from cows, at least that's what they claim
I added a clarification and I left the initial text
haha . lol
OK , I just thought that it may not be common to drink milk in the place you live, based on your response, but now I understand that's a personal thing about you
So as I understand, you mostly hate the idea of milk and not the milk itself
It may be a little complicated if you are unfamiliar but it gets easier once you engage with it and become familiar
IF you need something tell me, but I guess you can easily find a Greek in Australia
I can't see the image
>third time in July
I have also been in Tolo, but not this year
What were the other times you being there
It is definitively common
But I think cow milk is more common, but I am not sure, because it may differs from town to town or between cities and rural areas
Ok, I think that full fat milk or sweet milk is generally better
I actually just read their sure again and they are writing " fresh milk, from the farms if Thessaloniki and Macedonia directly to your glass "
So maybe they process it, I am not 100 % sure based on what they are saying
EDIT : I also just read the following
The raising of the cows by the member farms of THES gala Cooperative is done with tender loving care, utilization of modern equipment and efficient management systems
Nearly all of our feeds are Greek products cultivated though contract farming under the guidance and supervision of agronomists, and with respect for the environment
Milk gathering is performed in a shed using milking machines in an environment that is clean, protected and ideal for safeguarding the quality of the milk
The milk is stored, cooled and stirred in stainless steel refrigerated tanks, that are washed and disinfected daily to secure the milk’s purity and freshness
Cow milk is common and goat milk is also common
In my family we drink mostly cow milk
I think goat milk is more common in rural areas
But you can easily find both anywhere in Greece
What about USA
BTW In which State do you live
Thank you
But I have to ask why do you think that
I hope that you had a nice experience here ;)
One day I would also like to visit your country :)
I mostly drink it cold
But if I am ill or if I have a headache or a stomachache , then I drink it very warm
But since we all like the good white stuff, we are good
I live in southern suburbs of Athens
Thank you
I also have respect for Australians because you managed to build a great country even though they initially sent convicted criminals to your land, you did a great job and you managed to make it a very nice country to live
Do you know why this happened
I agree
Something else that I would add is coca-cola and jeep
You should have replied in Finnish lol
If you live near the borders or in a small country ,then it is relatively common
Schengen countries  abolished all passport and all other types of border control at their mutual borders
An image about Schengen and EU countries  [
But i guess that generally for most people  isn't very common, like something that you do very often or on a regular basis
For people who can't read Greek,  these names are Christos and Christina,  but because Christ in Greek is Christos,  the name Christos is written with η instead of an I.
Okay
Please excuse my English
What about Germany
I think it's also some common  history that we have , that makes us have good relationship
What about  Sweeden
We love you too
Una faccia una razza
I sometimes read about EU, for example new EU laws and regulations, so I guess that I do to some degree
We have 40 parties but  only 6 of them are in the parliament
In the last national elections  the parties that entered the parliament were
A center right  party (New Democracy) that  took 39
A leftist party(Syriza) that took 31
53%
A social democrat party (Movement of Change) that  took 8
10%
A communist party (Communist Party of Greece)  that took 5
3%,
A far right  party (Greek solution) that took 3
And another leftist party ( Mera25 - Diem 25) that took 3,44%.
The rest of the parties didn't manage to get over 3% to enter the parliament and they got 8
07% together
&#x200B;
The results of the last nationals elections
&#x200B;
list of Greek political parties
Yeah, I just wrote the official names of the parties
The movement of change is a party that creates when pasok and some other minor parties decided to unite
I added the Greek name of Diem25 which is Mera25 and it might be more known to Greeks
But yeah it's the party of Varoufakis
Yeah, you are right,  both of these things are actually true
First name + last name,
Sometimes someone might have 2 first names
Most of the times last name is taken from the father , but I know some people who took it from their mother
EDIT: Some people have 2 last names
I wasn't really aware of that,  sorry for not mentioning it
I will add it
Yeah that's right , but I just mean that it's not the majority
Yes, but it's not compulsory
In my school it was kinda fun because my religious teacher was progressive  and open minded , and there were a lot of debates during the class , usually between kids and the teachers
I usually got good grades in that subject
Also as someone else said .   is 2/3 Christianity and 1/3 other religions, of which we skip a lot and basically just talk very briefly about Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism, probably making many wrong assumptions about them in the process .
Personally the thing that I mostly dislike is that this subject  wasn't very objective, because it gave too much emphasis on Christianity
It would be better if  it gave the same emphasis on every religion
BTW is it compulsory there
Here if someone want can choose not to attend it
i know a lot of people who just did this
I thought that you had catholic schools there, but I guess they are exempted from that law , because they are private schools,  right
When I went to high school they also taught about other religions too
But I agree with you t , because the class is biased towards Christianity and it gives more emphasis on it , but at least it is not compulsory
Also , in my school it was done better, because my teacher was open-minded , so she didn't force religion on anybody, she did have debates with kids etc
When I went to high school they also taught about other religions too
But I agree with you t , because the class is biased towards Christianity and it gives more emphasis on it , but at least it is not compulsory
Also , in my school it was done better, because my teacher was open-minded , so she didn't force religion on anybody, she did have debates with kids etc
Luckily our teacher was more progressive and open-minded
This teacher sound very regressive and close-minded
That sounds  like propaganda
I guess Thessaloniki, because it's the second biggest city  but it's far too north or Patra because it's the third  biggest city and it's a nice city and it would also be nice to boost it it up .
But right now Athens is the best choice , because Athens ( not the municipality of Athens , the boarder  area\_)is the richest are of Greece and it has the most businesses, cultural activities like theaters  also sports ,music festivals and  technological businesses etc and is   the city with most population and it is easily accessible from al the mainland Greece
So maybe I would choose Thessaloniki because it's the second more important city or Patra since it's closer to Athens and it is the third biggest city
I am not sure if there are other good options
Based
By the same logic I would choose  Luxembourg city or  Berlin
They are really good at running a country
I agree with you
BTW I like your username
I agree with this
Here around 50% of import/export is also done with EU countries
Do you also have waiting times
I have read from  a guy from America ( if I recall correctly) that said that a big downside of public healthcare is waiting time and some European countries that have public health care have waiting times and it’s good that we don’t have that here etc . Except if he meant that there the waiting time there is short or that someone has to wait even for urgent cases
Yeah  I also believe that waiting times are different in different countries
They are also different even between different hospitals in the same region
I think that it has to do with the availability of doctors, nurses , rooms , number of appointments etc
Was it because your history teacher didn't teach you enough of it or because you didn't study enough of it
I would say New Years Eve cause all people  are cheering, they celebrate and they gather to eat , drink and have fun, outside there are fireworks and the atmosphere is generally cheerful
>(this may differ from house to house)
That's true, my family and my friends don't go to church cause we aren't really religious
Edit: wording
I think that's because the other orthodox churches follow the old calendar, but the Greek orthodox church doesn't.
The majority of people that  I know don't fast , but I agree that it is usually celebrated on 25th
I saw someone that posted this [ and I think that it may be kinda accurate, so I will add other two types [
and this [
&#x200B;
I guess that fit the stereotypical image, especially of some rural areas
But I should note that in Greece there people with different skin tones, hair types, hair tones and shades etc
Also there are many types of facial features
So I   doubt that I recognised a Greek just by their facial features
For example there are Greek's that have blue eyes and blond hair ,brown eyes,  with light skin with dark skin,  people that have small lips, big lips etc
Also most people don't dress like these photos
I think that I know almost all US states and I can point some of them at the map
I also know some stereotypes about the mannerisms of each place ( like southern hospitality, that the people in NY or NYC are blunt, lol I am not sure if that counts as knowledge , but I learnt that from New Yorkers)  some jokes about them (like florida man, alabama jokes) some local cultural  stuff like southern rock, Gumbo from Louisiana . I know some very basic things about the climate of the US regions
I personally have family friends from USA and I also sometimes speak with Americans online (like here on reddit)
I think that states are far more know than counties or provinces or regions in European countries like the one you mentioned , because US states have a bigger degree of autonomy (about policies, laws, taxation etc), US states are more powerful and richer that the average region in an average region of a European country ( for example California would be one of the richest countries if it was a sovereign state) and many of them have the size of a country
So I think that because of that reasons they gain some popularity separately from the USA
( I am not sure if I expressed that properly, I hope you know what I mean)   .But I think that biggest reason that many people know the some us states is the media and the news
However most people know only the most famous states (like New York, Alaska, Hawaii, California, Florida, Texas)
I believe that the fame of each state has to do with media exposure and maybe with their economy , because a state with a good economy will attract more people and businesses , so more people are going to know it and I guess there other factors that may contribute to their fame
Also I would like to  emphasize  that this knowledge is mostly superficial, for example most people don't know  who is their governor of these states or where they are on the map or their capital etc
or their state laws ( except if is someone really likes a state , for example I know someone who wants to move in New York and this person knows it's governor and other facts about it)
Also many people know the big cities of USA, like NYC, Las Vegas, Los Angeles etc
Not a completely different, but I guess it counts
Γιατί = why
Για τι = for what
for example
Γιατί μάχεσαι; = Why are you fighting
Για τι μάχεσαι; = What are you fighting for
Γιατί είσαι εδώ = Why are you here
Για τι είσαι εδώ = What are you here for
Yes I am
But sometimes I am thinking about going to  USA
>Our passport is ranked 4th
Same here, our passport is also ranked fourth
I guess that's partly because of EU or schengen
So do you consider to go to live somewhere outside of EU like a french-speaking are of Switzerland or you jut want to leave from EU
Well, there are still countries with different currencies
Personally I don't miss it, because I never experienced it
I get that
But still even if you didn't see benefits from EU, wouldn't they see some negative things if they leave like some meds that are imported from EU would be more expensive ?
That applies for Greek too
BTW The gender of the word city is also feminine in Greek
How do you speak German as Swiss
Also are also Swiss German generally the same or there important differences between every canton's local dialect ?
BTW I think that this show is also very good for adults
I think most people prefer euro over drachma
Usually I call the by their name but sometimes use words like bro , friend, boy (agori/agorina) , sometimes malakas but it's also considered an inappropriate and is mainly used with friends , also it might be used as an insult, but it depends on how it is being used
It can be considered as an insult like stupid or something, other times it can mean a mastrubator and it can be used  as way to refer to someone , mainly between friends
Generally it depends on the context
Also people avoid using it in people who aren't their close friends, cause it isn't considered appropriate
The most common one is friend (φίλε)
That's true
BTW I think that today most kids "believe" to the modern version of santa klaus who brings gifts  and he is overweight, with red clothes, white beard etc
In the building that I live people who pay rent,  pay around 600 € per month for an apartment , but I guess that's still cheap in comparison with other European cities
I think it’s not common but I support it and I really like Europe day, but I recently found it out
There are flags in some public buildings like city halls for example
And some people care
I would recommend you The Orge of Athens (1956) .  In Greek it is called the Dragon,  ο Δράκος.
I also like very much a movie called five more minutes
5 λεπτά ακόμα,  (2006)
I also liked the movie An (2012) and Worlds apart (2015)
It's a nice movie and it is also thought provoking,  but it might be bizarre and weird for some people
I would like her to be more progressive and more supportive of lgbtq , but I think she has done a good job in Germany, based on the current situation of Germany
No problem, I understand
That it is a phonemic language
You know how a word sounds,  by just reading it,  even if you have never heard of it, with very few exceptions
Usually yes,except if you are very close to them  and they let you do it ( like for example the house of you grandparents that you visit very often) or if they have given you the permission to do it
Not my parents, but I have communicated with my father in English when we were close to an old relative and we wanted to say something personal, but this person doesn’t hear very well, so maybe they didn’t understand that we were speaking in another language
I like mochaccino, even though I usually don't drink coffee
Btw do you talk with her about political issues like the current events or you are avoiding such controversial topics
I think that since you are both atheists thing are fine,  because I have the impression ( correct me if I am wrong)  like some differences ( like gender roles , religious customs etc)  that they have and we don't have exist due to Islam and (Erdogan), but I think that's mostly true for far eastern rural parts of Turkey
Also in most cities people in both countries are secular despite their religion
In addition to that I guess that the stereotypes that we have for each othet, which in most cases are false,  will be less dominant in a third country
Yeah,  I meant that those are the usually stereotypes for muslim nations
But I don't believe in such stereotypes,  and I believe that many people in Turkey are secular,  despite that these days due to Hagia Sofia we mostly see the more extremist and religious people
>Oh
We don't believe in gender roles either
I'm the one who usually cooks (I love cooking)
That's nice I also like to cook occasionally
Here we don't use terms like millenials and baby boomers
There are people who talk about younger and older people, but generations aren't a big thing here and we don't categorize them as Americans do
BTW what do you think about that
Εντάξει όμως δεν χρησιμοποιείται πολύ συχνά και έτσι όπως χρησιμοποιούνται οι γενιές στην Αμερική. Επιπλέον δεν υπάρχει στενή κατηγοριοποίηση των γενιών. πχ η γενιά του πολυτεχνείου ανέφερες δεν είναι επίσημος όρος. Στην Αμερική έχουν επίσημου όρους για κάθε γενιά.
I think that with people  close to you like close  family members  it is not a problem
But generally I think it might be kinda rude or inelegant if you ask someone about their wage/salary
But in some situations it might be okay
I think yes but it depends on the age, I think that after elementary school kids walk alone to school , but also many kids walk alone before that, I guess it depends on the family and on the area
I think that Estonia is very good combination of a  secular and sober country
Even though they are not famous for being sober, but it's true
It has a photo of the person who owns the ID,  their name, their last name,  the first and last names of their parents,  date of birth,  place of birth,  the municipal that they live,  it also has height but it's empty in my ID
Also it write some other stuff like the authority which gave the ID , the ID number and the signature of the owner of the ID
In addition to that,  there is a new ID which is kinda different like more advanced, but I don't know a lot about it
The Erasmus Program is a  student exchange program between between European countries  ( mostly countries from European Union but there are other countries too like Iceland and UK)
It's easier than Hungarian , but few people who aren't from Greece speaking it and few people would dedicate time to learn it, just to participate in an Erasmus program in Greece
Personally I can't be 100% sure just by their appearance
I have seen people that I thought that they were Greeks but it turned out that they were tourists
Also there are some stereotypical faces for some countries , but many people from those countries don't fit in them .
BTW I want to say to some commenters that just because someone assumes that you are from France when you speak French this doesn't meant that this person thinks that French is only spoken in France
It's just that the most French speakers  are in France , so statically it's the best guess to make
>In The Netherlands almost every village/town has its own dialect of Dutch, so I wonder if that’s the same in the rest of Europe
Here, there is a difference from region to region, not so much from town to town , except for  villages and islands  that may have different customs and dialects, even though they are in the same region
So it's true for regions, villages and islands
I do not think so
It is general about people who mock Greece
It doesn't mention Germans, as far as I remember
I agree, we shouldn't think that gay is an insult
It is totally okay to be gay
Even the word itself has a positive meaning
I support Cyprus also Italy, Spain and the other Southern/Mediterranean European countries
I also support EU countries in general
I also support USA
That's almost the opposite from the other Greeks(except for the basketball part)
Nice comeback
I agree,  they are just exaggerating and dramatizing what happened
I doubt that thus will leas to third world war
But they killed someone guilty for many crimes,  someone who is the second in command in a country that kills apostates from Islam,  he attacked their embassy,  he killed many innocent people,  he is a violator of human rights etc
Personally I don't take sides here,  but I can't say that I support Iran or the general Qassem,  cause he was guilty
But General Qassem isn't innocent
He actually killed innocent people,  is the second leader in a country who kills apostates from Islam,  he is a violator of human rights
I think if you want to support peace and justice,  you shouldn't take sides
I guess that counts as a deregulation
Do they have any seats
&#x200B;
we have yellow press or yellow journalism  which is sensationalized news that aim to attract readers and audience without presenting news that are necessarily accurate
I am not sure how/when/where it started
edit: we also use the the phrase "pink video" to describe pornographic videos
I am not aware of something like that
I think most people here use google maps
The printed letters
Our school wasn't focused in writing styles,  they just wanted us to write properly
I don't think that's controversial in USA , maybe it is in some groups like vegans and vegetarians, but the same is true about Greek vegans and vegetarians and generally vegans and vegetarians from all countries . At least that's my experience based on  family friends from the US and based on Americans that I have met in Greece and they went to eat sea foods like octopus
I guess it also depends on the individual American too
Except if you are talking about living or moving octopus which is also considered disgusting here
I think that pastitsio and musaka( even though I don't like musaka) are some popular (here) Greek examples also I guess some deserts are rice pudding (rizogalo) , kormos etc
We call Belarus Λευκορωσσία which translates to White Russia,
We call Switzerland Ελβετία which is Elvetia
We call France Γαλλία which is Galia  ( g pronounced a wh from what)
Because the the southern -Mediterranean European countries have better climate to grow vegetables,  they are good in production of olive oil etc
Also food plays an important role in our cultures
I didn't mean that food plays an important role in our culture because of the climate
I meant it as an additional reason that the Southern European dishes are considered tasteful
But probably this is because of our climate, so maybe you are right
He said that's how they called today in Greece, for example in history classes
But I am not sure how the Byzantines called them
I think they didn't recognize them as Romans, because they recognized themselves as the true Romans
I think that this applies to church going people who are extremely religious .
Can you give an example of him speaking about an issue that he cares but he doesn't really get it
I haven't see anyone like that in real life, only on the internet, so I guess a small percentage of them might exist, but might be ashamed to say that the earth is flat because they know it's wrong
Vice once interviews a flat-earther and he was wearing a mask on his face
I think that it is mandatory to be vaccinated in order to go to school here
So how did she went to school
Yeah (and for everyone who migh be interested) it came from a word that originally means daddy
[  [
Not stupid , just something that I remember lol
German:
Hallo,Ich bin Stefanos, Ich komme aus Griechenland woher kommst du
Ich spiele
Ich liebe dich
&#x200B;
Spanish : no quiero provocarte
BTW Why did you thought that you were in Germany ?
I guess that counts as little .
I guess it can be useful sometimes lol
I think it's the same thing as to call Slovak republic Slovakia .
Do you usually say  Česko  or  Česká repulika  ?
OK you got me with that
My favorites towns to live are the towns that are in the southern suburb of Athens , and those near them that are outside of Athens
Because they are very peaceful and calm they have beautiful beaches,trees and mountains, there a lot more Green in comparison with a lot of other cities here, they are relatively economically advanced, there are a lot of things to do there ,they have plenty of shops, restaurants,cafes, activities , bowling etc and they are generally close to Athens, so you can find any activity, shop, subway,education center, a very big library and generally almost all things that you may need in Greece etc
I Also like Trikala because it's an  innovative and very well organised city, with very beautiful landscapes and it's also a soothing and peaceful place
I am talking about Voula,Glyfada, New Smyrni, Vouliagmeni etc etc
Is that considered a city
Some of the memes in my language are good
I want to know anything more
I buy the milk refrigerated and I put it again in fridge when I go home
The eggs aren't sold refrigerated, but I put them in the fridge
I use a qwerty keyboard but next to the Latin letters there are Greek and by pressing  shift+alt you switch alphabets .
Also the Byzantines called themselves and their empire Roman
>The common accent from Athens is just considered normal
I agree that almost anyone believes that,  but about the others you mentioned,  I think that it is more subjective
I think that most people are okay with it and don't really care if someone is eating alone
The only thing that I have heard is someone who was kinda shy (or ashamed)  of doing it
So as I understand it's not weird , but there are people who consider it weird
I had the opposite impression about Scandinavia
Yea many people across Europe wear them and I have seen some of them
I know a little bit, but I would like to educate myself in order to expand my knowledge about you
I think that's mostly true for countries like UAE, Saudi Arabia etc , based on my experience if they know that someone for example is Algerian then they will call them Algerian and not Arab
Edit: I think that most people here don't even think of Algerians as Arabs
I think that they show it every year before Christmas,  so in a way yes
Or generally outside of Attica :p
I think that also depends on the level of education for the people who 40+ years old, usually the most educated of them know (some) English
But the older you get the more rare it becomes
So for people who are old it's not common to be fluent in another language
Your teacher didn't know that Norway fought against Germany in WW2 ?
I hope that she wasn't a history teacher
I think that I have heard that story before
Are you a guy who went in college to USA and your teacher told you that there are colleges only for black people and you asked if there also colleges for white people
Okay then, sorry
So are you in Norway now
How was life in USA
Lol I just say that this thread is one moth old
Haha, I found it here [  and I clicked it to read it
I would also love to try horseback riding, so far I have only ride a pony when I was kid and it was great, and I love animals , so it would be a very pleasant experience
I am also thinking about visiting the states when I will finish my studies , I also want to visit  European countries
>I think I wanna visit countries in Europe first
Do you have specific countries in your mind
The people view it positively it has nice stuff and good food
It is considered kinda affordable, there are cheap stuff and stuff hat are more expensive, but the quality of it's products is regarded as good
In which country
I think they are ok
I know people who work in various jobs and have nose rings or ear rings and they are totally okay
Maybe there are some elderly people that don't really like them, but generally it's acceptable
But maybe it's also depends on the job, for example I would  guess that there would be specific rules for nurses
We do the opposite
We use commas as decimal separators
For example 1 euro and 2 cents is written as 1,02 euros and one million euros is written as 1
000
000  euros
Even though most people are culturally Christians and get baptized,  I think that most people don't care if you are an atheist,  I know many atheists and they are fine
Even our previous prime minister is an atheist
Even though most people are culturally Christians and get baptized,  I think that most people don't care if you are an atheist,  I know many atheists and they are fine
Even our previous prime minister is an atheist
I think this person means that most people if you that you are an atheist they ignore it/ don't care about it
I think that Cyprus is considered to be a part of Europe
At least in my opinion is definetely A European place
BTW I am curious you as a Cypriot  in which continent do you think that Cyprus belong to
Also do you feel more connectd with other European coutries or with Asia or with Africa
Germany, I think it's a very useful language and I also  like the German culture
Spanish, because it's sounds good, I like Spanish culture, it's a language that it's spoken by a lot of countries and it can help me to learn Italian and Portuguese
Luxembourgish because I like the country and their culture or maybe French for similar reasons and because French is a nice language and I think this and combination with the above languages would make it easier for to me to learn other European languages like Luxembourgish, Danish  etc
I think that all regural police officers have handguns
I think in my country not so good
Close to where I live there is a road for bikes close to southern suburbs of Athens ( I  this it is this one [ there is another one relatively close to me [
Also there some bike friendly cities like Trikala   [
So I guess it also depends on the municipality and on the people of each area
But generally the situation isn't good here, we need more and better infrastructures because there aren't a lot of such infrastructures
Actually there are bike roads in Athens like these   [  [
Also there some bike friendly cities like Trikala   [
So I guess it also depends on the municipality and on the people of each area
But the situation is still not  good here and we need to build better and safer infrastructure and better education about such things
I doubt that people think that bikes are for kids, at least where I live (southern suburbs of Athens) I have never heard that or something similar
But I guess things might be different in other areas
I visit family members , but very rarely (if ever) all the  family members meet together .
But usually If I meet many relatives at the same time, it would be for an event like new year eve, Christmas ,a wedding or a funeral or for another event
Usually we eat and drink and trying to have fun and sometime we are debating .
I think that depends on the degree ,the experience and of the job that they might have and on the expenses that they have
But generally is not much compared to north-western European countries
>Quite the opposite I would say
Parents here and the society in general pressure you to not proceed with making a family before you mature enough, figure out what you're gonna do in life and/or find a stable income
I agree
>With women though, that is not completely the rule as they start facing pressure from their inner circle as their friends begin to get married and have children
I don't know if that is self-imposed or actual externally imposed pressure
I think it depends on condition, sometimes it's self-imposed, sometimes it's expected , but am not sure if it's actual pressure or just  expectations ( mostly from older generations or based on area or based on social circle) sometimes neither
I think nowadays there many women in those ages that haven't made a family, so I guess it's common today
Less corruption, better social and egalitarian policies, better education, and economy and more kindness
I think there is a law here since 2015-2017 and it’s obligatory for all stores here to accept payment through card, maybe there isn’t such law in Italy
That would be great
I think that it should be taught in schools
Are you sure about the last part
One of my yeacher told us in highschool that it is actually closer and it was based on studies by scholars etc
>He was Dutch, he wasn't acclimated to the Greek alphabet or the language's intricacies
I am nor sure if his nationality matters, there is a Belgian guy in youtube who speaks very good Greek a, I think that someone  who studies a language can become fluent in that language . BTW I am not saying this about this specific person but in general
> While his efforts were valiant and advanced the understanding of how our ancestors spoke back then, Greek scholars have reconstructed a pronunciation that is closer to how the ancient tongue was spoken
Yeah I think thatere many good Greek profesors who have made accurate remarks about the anceint Greek pronounciation . I just said that Erasmian is closer to ancient Freek pronounciation (based on ancient sources) than the modern Greek pronounciation , based on academia (even in Greek universities) , not that it's perfect or better than other reconstructed accents based on ancient sources
&#x200B;
War of 1897
Poor economic management
Cold: -1°C-5°C
Chilly: 10°C-12°C
Perfect: 25°C-30°C
Warm: 31°C-34°C
Hot : 35°C or more
But it also depends on other circumstances such as wind and humidity
BTW Congratulations for using °C. I guess it is beneficial to be in a European sub
I agree with that
I like [Olympiakos's logo] ( I hope that's not due to the fact that I am biased)    [Celta's Vigo logo] ,  [Kubikenborgs IF]  and   [Boavista logo] .
I guess in terms of how easy it's to get a job I would recommend physical therapy, computer science-software engineer, cooking, nursing schools  and  military schools and police academies ,because you work immediately after graduation
We also have good tap water
We also say στην άλλη άκρη του κόσμου which means at the other edge/side of the world
We also say στην άλλη άκρη του κόσμου which means at the other edge/side of the world
Devil's mother is also a real place in Ireland
Btw We also use that expression in Greece
To be fair it sounds like a made up name and I also thought that it is a made up name as a little kid
>Εγκέλαδος (Engelados) = Earthquake, and also a name of a Titan, son of Tartarus and Gaia, who shook the earth whenever he was pissed off
As far as I know, we use the word σεισμός sismos for earthquake
Maybe engelados is used sometimes metaphorically for something that causes earthquake for example χτύπημα του Εγκέλαδου or sometimes just Εγκέλαδος.
I thought that σεισμος was the most formal one and the other was more metaphorical , but maybe it's because I hear σεισμος more often ( by people, news etc)
17-18 (It depends which month they have their birthday)
6 years of elementary school, 3 years of gymnasium and 3 years of Lyceum ( I think they are called junior and senior high school in English)
A European passport
But you can travel to all EU member states,  without a passport
So I am not sure even if passports are necessary,  except if you travel outside of European Union
I think that you don't need passport to travel to European Union/Schengen, just something that counts as valid ID
Ok, amigo
True, but I think that it's not always mentioned
For an average family of 4, it is mostly one of tge followings 100,120,150,200
It depends how many members a family has,  what foods they are eating and if they cook their own food
It is pretty easy to go to other Schengen countries, you just show your national ID ( or something that it counts as valid ID like passport) , based on my experience
But the countries that share boarders with my country aren't Schengen members
Brussels , European Parliament, Flanders and Walloon
Beautiful city
lol
> where the cheap  blah blah
There is a stereotype that Scots are stingy , I don't know where it came from
If you have problem with receiving money and you don't know what to do with them, contact me
Haha, I was just kidding(lol I know it's obvious)
Hahaha

>Be it the country itself
How can the country invent something by itself
You are right
That's true but I was referring to Herodotus who first treated historical subjects using a method of systematic investigation—specifically, by collecting his materials and then critically arranging them into an historiographic narrative
So I mostly meant history with systematic and organized form
Thank you,  I will add it
I was just uncertain in the beginning,  because,  when I had a conversation with a guy and he told me that technically all people had a kind of philosophy
Thank you
I just added what I remembered
Btw Did algebra start here
I think it was invented by Babylonians
Thank you,  I will add it
Well,  we are pretty good at that,  but as you may ( or maybe not
)  know other nations before Greece had national debt,  so unfortunately I can't add it to the list of our inventions
It's okay,  no offense taken
I added the  test Pap or Pap test,  which is a recent invention
Btw I got it,  I was kinda kidding
Yeah,  I think you are right
Yeah,  I think Pythagoras gave that name first
Yeah,  it's common knowledge
I guess I was just misinformed
pro : we have free universities and free healthcare, good weather, there are helpful and nice people here, nightlife
cons :  our economy isn't so good, there is a rise of extremist parties
I thought that you would say more European cause in another comment you were talking about LGBTQ rights , progressivism etc and usually Europe is culturally more progressive and egalitarian (about genders etc) ( Except if I remember another person)
Yeah I get that and you definetely have a point
I think that there different types of cultures like national/social cultureand political culture and I would say that my country is politcally more Eruopean ( also we are in mainland Europe) I am not sure about Cyprus though
For example we have democracy , freedom of speech etc so I feel more alligned with other European countries (when it comes to that\_ rather than with some Middle Eastern countries ( even thought there some democratic countries there, I think that based on what I have read Isreal is the most democratic country there)  But Yeah I also identify with East Med , but even more with Southern Europe, because I have observed that we also have similarities with some Souther European countries  in terms of culture climate, family,attitude etc
Yes, of course they can
Unfortunately I didn't have cooking lessons in my school
I like the names Zahir , Axel , Wolfgang and Felix
At least it's a beautiful city, unlike Brussels
I teach straight guys to say the same thing , if they want to sleep with me and still call themselves straight
There many people who use fireplace and they burn woods inside it
It's not the most popular method but I know people who do it during the winter
Something that comes to my mind is the name "Europe".
I think most Southern Europeans ( at least that I know) like France
They sound fun, especially if you combine them, lol
Mostly people who cooperated with nazis
Such as Georgios Tsolakoglou, Konstantinos Logothetopoulos and Ioannis Rallis who were Prime ministers during Nazi occupation and basically puppets of Nazis
Also the people who took part in The Security Battalions (Greek: Τάγματα Ασφαλείας) or people who cooperated with them
Such as:  Ioannis Rallis
Theodoros Pangalos
Stylianos Gonatas
Georgios Grivas
Georgios Poulos
Lol haha
He didn't exactly sold it , because he made them sign that they have nothing to do with Alexander the great and the ancient history of Macedonia
He made them sign that their language is actually a Slavic language and he made them change their name from Macedonia to Northern Macedonia
Even the name Macedonian of their language hasn't any real historical meaning  because they signed that it is a Slavic language
It isn't a great deal
But  before the deal,  people from Macedonia called themselves Macedonia and they had statues of Alexander the great and the claimed Alexander the Great as their ancestor
But now those things changed
Tsipras made a compromission and he made the situation better than before
You have to compare the before and the after
Κανένα πρόβλημα,  και εγώ φιλικά τα γράφω και πιστεύω πως αν αγαπάμε πραγματικά την Ελλάδα δεν πρέπει να τσακωνόμαστε μεταξύ μας,  άλλα κάνουμε το καλύτερο για τη χώρα μας και τους πολίτες της.
I think that Nazi party had less than 50% support,  so I guess most Germans weren't supporters of the Nazi party
They were all part of Yugoslavia
We say French shower
I think that base on gdp generally the cities in the attica region like Athens have seen the biggest development
The capital Z is written Z (the same as the latin Z)  and the lower z is written ζ , but I have seen it written as cursive z. As far as I know it's written without a line
Not very common, but not very rare either , most people I know haven't a second name, I guess it's like like 1-2 per 10 people or 10-20 % maybe like 15%.
There are a few that I like
It's not something unique , but I lie it [
[ (I put this just because I like the statue)
Here is images of another pharmacy in southern suburbs of Athens that also looks cool  [
It looks awesome
>Units for Reinstatement of Order, but I guess that goes into political territory
I am not sure if they are into political territory , cause they are just part of the police and they are mainly for riots, protests etc and not directly related with politics even though the governments give them directions and commands
BTW I think that there also people who dislike journalists who are not honest and objective
>Any reasonable analysis puts him as centre right (or on the left, for any Americans reading
Why do you think that centre right is left for Americans
But I think that some democrats like Sanders are actually center left
He has said that he supports social democracy
So is it allowed to live and travel in Scengen without having any form of citizenship
Also how easy is to aquire ID or other documents without a citizenship
I don't like when people insult Italy
Yeah that's right
>  also Croatia only we can do that
It's like when you say something bad about your little bro or sis or another family member, only you have the right to do that not strangers
I agree with you
I think he mean jokes in a bad way about the situation of the country
>(and I kind of believe we do deserve them)
Generalizations are almost always wrong
>But luckily everyone is alloved to make fun of sweden :P
Lol ,I guess you are funny
that was actually funny
You are welcome <3 .
>Hah did you realize that Greece needs money haha haha Greece poor
That's a lie, I am going to come there to prove you wrong and I am going to bring evidence with me
I am kidding I won't come there but not because I have not money, yeah totally not for that
Btw you need to improve the grammar of your native language
/s of course (except from the grammar part)
>Since we are in the same boat
If we are in the same boat then it is a very good boat
Omg he shouldn't have said stuff like that especially when he came to your country as a tourist
> mafia
OK but can you do me a favor
Please don't kill me
Lol
Normally I should be afraid cause of the movie reference and the symbolism but I will accept it because I am so poor that I have nothing else to eat and I believe that a horse head would be a nice and tasty meal
Trust me, it's a both way street
>Sounds like something a Greek would make up
Well if you don't believe me, there some ways that will make you believe it for sure
( just kidding)
Actually the law says that women can't rape not that the man can't be raped
But yeah this law is kinda anachronistic, but even in that case women who rape men will be punished as rapists, I think the only difference is terminology
But that also might me a problem , because different words give a different "gravity" to situations
German movies is something unusual here
We mostly have American and British movies, but  occasional they show French movies and I there also times that they show movies from other European countries like Italian movies
If it's sunny not rainy then above 20 C I am comfortable, but sometimes even above 16 C if it's higher than 20 C during the rest of the day
For example today the temperature is 16 C to 24 C in my town and I am comfortable wearing short sleeves outside
That sounds interesting
Where can I find more information about this
Same here, except the last two ( I think)
Footing isn't really used here ( as far as I know) and meeting may refer to a formal appointment in general like in business convention not just for political stuff
Yeah
BTW nice name .
It makes sense
Whatever you said
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
>We've been kinda chill with Bulgaria but we sort of went to war twice in the 1900s I guess
Plus I think that  there was a conflict over a dog
Me neither, I learnt it from reddit lol
It is mostly known as Αυστροουγγαρία or as Αυστροουγγρική Αυτοκρατορία
Literally Austrohungary (more informal) or  Austrohungarian Empire (more formal)
Yeah,  there is a space in my fridge for eggs
But it doesn't really matters
You killed him with that
Don't you tell me that you are one  of those beer guys
If yes, your compatriots might send you to Germany or to eastern Europe
You just revealed the secrets of your country
They are spiritual people
That sounds like a superpower
I knew some Polish in school, but I guess school wasn't a good environment for drinking
I think that most people prefer wine, but I personally prefer milk
BTW Where are you from
So are you here because you like various European countries and their culture, or you are an American that secretly spies EU in order to destroy it
lol just kidding
BTW What do you like to drink in USA, in the State you live
I speculate that beer is the most popular drink, but I might be mistaken
That's  not offensive , in some cases it's good
Yeah
No,  but once I with two guys were walking and a group of people asked us if we have money with us and I think they said us to show our money to them and we ran away
Someone took my pen and gave back a pen that didn't work
What a little monster he was
Is it common in Netherlands to steal bikes
3 times
do you live in an area with high criminality or it was "bad luck"?
Here it depends, if someone ask you a pen to write something or temporarily the they supposed to gie it back
There do they suppose to never return it even if they asked for just one minute
If that's the case at least you know it, also if that's the case would it be rude if you asked them if they are done with the pen
I think it depends on the neighborhood of Athens
I live in southern suburbs and it is generally very safe here at all hours
Not only the centers
I live in suburbs and I am also not reliant to car
But there is not much traffic,  so I guess the situation is better than the center
>Can you tell me some positive news from your country / region
some positive news from your country / region . Lol
I wish I had something else to say
&#x200B;
BTW something actually positive is that we have a lot of tourists near the place that I live
Is the political party of Zelensky going to take part
Btw is he a good president
>positive news
&#x200B;
>We may have the most nuclear weapons in the world
I guess the definition for the word positive is different for every person
>  I barely see them
Me too
I guess people took the tv show and his role really seriously
Maybe they still hope that he will change something for good because he is president for a short time
Btw what is his political position/ affiliation ? Would say he is left winger, right winger, a centrist or something else
I think that after football basketball is the most popular spot at least in Greece and some people here sometimes get crazy over it
>*Passes out on a couch with Sweden
Why with Sweden
Is that a reference of something I do not know
>Us, Spain, Italy and Greece are asking Germany to pick up the tab
We would also ordered many foods and drink alcohol galore and we would drunk alcoholic drinks
Greece would, ordered many foods, got drunk, started to sing drunk songs with Germany and asked you a loan , so we can pay for everything we ordered
Thank you for suggesting us
You will not regret it
Haha, true
Actually that's probably good for us
Because when we take loans we also paid interests and we loose money
>Griechischer Wein
I just heard it and I like it, even though I don't understand the lyrics
I have "forgot" my German
It was last applied in 1972, and the death penalty was abolished in stages between 1975 and 2005 including wartime crimes, treason that weren't covered when the death setence was first abolished etc
As far as I know it was a politcal decision, I don't know if there was a big push
There are some people who proposed it
I think oficially only alt-right parties propose it, but maybe there are people from other political ideologies that want it
To be more specific  Capital punishment was abolished for peacetime crimes other than [high treason] **during wartime** by article 7 of the [Constitution of 1975] Oficially it was abolished in 2005 for all purposes
But practivally it had stopped since 1972
I think you are right and for some reason 3% of people voted him , even if he lied about having letters of Jesus and then he took it back , but the video that he said it still existed, that was clearly dishonesty . His followers are literally delusional
I think it depends on the people and on the immigrants
Some people are welcoming and some people are xenophobic
But I know some immigrants who live here for many years and they are generally fine here
BTW How do Americans view the people who immigrate to their country
I use a knife or a pizza cutter, but that sounds like a nice idea, I might try it
I don’t see it as weird, it’s just a different way to cut your pizza
Actually, I think that u/skidadle_gayboi was right because people usually different the metropolitan area or the greater area of the city with the city itself and usually they specify it when they are using the metro area or the greater area
I think it's correct to use the municipality Athens to refer to the city of Athens because it's a city in the sense that it has a mayor, a city council etc
>No one would say Athens is only 664,00 people or that Thessaloniki is 354,000
Yeah, but it depends on the context
Many people here talked about cities as administrative subdivisons .By whether you talk about metro area or the municipality of Athens is not really misleading, except if somoene asked about the one thing and you answer about the other thing ( but that's not what happened)
Yes for example George IV is Called Γεώργιος aka Yeorjios or Yeoryios .
Mcdonalds is popular
Some  Fridays or Saturdays  that I pass through it,  it's full of people
BTW There are also local fast food restaurants that sell burgers and stuff like that
But Greece isn't in a good economic state and maybe people on other countries pay more money for food outside than us or people here choose cheaper option when they go out and they don't spend a lot of money
(For example  Cyprus that it has similar culture but better economy , was darker on this map
)  Another reason might be that Goody's was already established there
But I think it is relatively popular in the big cities (not so much in small cities or in rural areas)   here based on Greek standards
For example I read there that they won 33 million in 2018, which is a lot for a fast food restaurant in Greece, There are a few who win so much like Goody's, Pizza Fan etc
or maybe it's just popular in my town
( by popular I mean that the store is full of customers when I visit it, I usually visit it on Friday and Saturday)
at least in Athens, I think its; doing quite well
I think more half of the outlets are here, so maybe it isn't so popular in rural areas
I live in southern suburb of Athens
So I guess they might only be popular here in Athens
When I was a kid, the parents just drove their kids to parties without staying there
Here I think that this happens only if you have a good job or a good position, for example I know someone who is engineer in a big company and he has like 200k euros in his bank account
But the average person who does an average job here  doesn't have a sufficient disposable income
But it also depends on the job and on position
As far as I know no
Are social libertarians included in liberals
>to be equal to social democratic
Many countries don't have "labour-parties" but they have social democratic parties, so I guess these people chose "socialist"
But I think that they mods should have added more categories, because now some ideologies are underrepresented
Personally I was between liberal and green
I also like social democrat but I wouldn't like to put socialist , because I am more of a libertarian social democrat, but I am also pro-environmentalist and supporter of green policies, so I guess I am green libertarian social democrat
I think it's popular many people that I know have them ( even though enough of them don't  take care of it ) , but I also know people who look better with shaved beard so they shave it or they can't grow it so they shave it
>/Russian/
How common is Russian language in Finland
Also are those people of Russian ancestry
In the future at least 100 years after now, or even 1000 years
I would able too see new art,  learn new things
Also due to more advanced scientific knowledge available, there will be less prejudices and false/ unscientific  beliefs better technology
Probably there would be less hard work due yo automation and maybe more work related with art and philosophy
In addition there would be less hunger in the world because of technologies like cultured meat
Plus I would able to enjoy all the things that exist right now
Most of the times no, but sometimes yes
Obviously they take of their shoes when they want to lay in bed or on the couch even if they don't take them of while enetering their house
lol when I enter in my house with my shoes the floor is still clean and it doesn't become dirty easily except if my shoes are dirty(if for expample I go to a dirty place or if its rainy etc) .
If cafes count, then definitely this hard rock cafe at municipality of Athens
I like those building of Goodys [
And those buildings from McDonalds
[ from municipality Glyfada, (southern suburbs of Athens, Attica) I kinda look that it's look kinda different than the rest of them
[ from Rhodes)
That's based on the fast food buildings I know and remember, there might be betters that I am unaware of
It is not uncommon to eat
Based on friends and family it is not something you eat every weak , but yes it is considered normal to eat them here
>Thsi might be a weird question, but I heard few people say how they don't understand that some people eat rabits, deers, ducks
Where are they from
Do they think that's weird
Some Americans here said that it is not abnormal and some other said that it is kinda weird
So I guess it depends on the State .
Btw In what State did you live
Where are you from
I wouldn't watch it if I was in your position
Do you support any sides
Personally I know Jewish people and I like them,  so I culturally feel closer to them . But I also would like a independent state for Palestine,  but under a different government because hamas has violated human rights many times
Btw where in Israel did you go
Yeah I mostly agree with what you said
I am not sure about the whole country,  but in my town I have noticed we have sushi bars/restaurants,  Italian restaurants,  Indian restaurants,  Chinese foods,  pizzerias,   we also have American fast food restaurants with burgers,  chicken wings etc Mexican restaurants, and if I remember correctly we also have middle eastern food
Also I think that there is a place(or places)  that have have variety of European cuisines
Thank you for your kind words
>How is the Mexican food
I think that it depends on the place
In some places like big cities,  it's easy to find a Mexican restaurant .
Btw I also like American foods
I like American foods like some Texas BBQ foods , I liked it very much it was tasty and I liked the combinations they made,  I also like your fast food like burgers
I don't remember eating something that I disliked it
Here is a quote that from Greek literature that I like,  but I don't know if it's common in media
"I hope nothing
I fear nothing
I am free
